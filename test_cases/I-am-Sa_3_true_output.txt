SAM (spins in circles) This is it!  This is it! 
DR. JAMISON And it's a girl... 
The BABY lets out her first cry.  Sam watches, awestruck. Gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to Rebecca.  Rebecca shakes her head - NOT NOW.  Gertie walks over to Sam. 
GERTIE There's someone who's been waitin' an awful long time to see you, Sam. 
She places the BABY into SAM'S ARMS.  Suddenly Sam's whole body RELAXES and becomes very still.  He looks to Rebecca, but she has turned away.  He meets Gertie's eyes.  Then in quiet amazement: 
SAM This is it. 
GERTIE What's her name? 
SAM (looks at clock) Let me see let me see let me see. 12:17, March 2nd.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Recorded March 2nd.  1967. Lyrics by John Lennon, music by Paul McCartney.  Lucy Diamond Dawson. 
We hear LIKE A LULLABY, "Picture yourself on a boat in a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies..." 
EXT. HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNING 
Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out, walk down the steps of the hospital holding their complimentary plastic baby bag.  Sam is nervous haling the precious cargo and Becca is agitated.  They see the bus pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they can hurry and catch it.  As he approaches the bus, he looks to Becca by his side, but she is not there.  He looks around and no sign of her. Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street.  He screams. 
SAM Becca!  Becca! 
The more he screams the faster she moves away.  Till there's no trace of her.  Sam stands in the middle of the busy block holding Lucy to his chest, devastated. 
We hear, "Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but she's gone." 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest.  Next to him is the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk.  Sam is surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground at night.  Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two against the world. 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN 
A marvel of organization.  A closet reveals clothes on hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color.  A carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift bookshelves. 
Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls.  Becca's things sit in one corner.  An island of chaos in an "Hold Everything" showroom.  The kitchen counter has been transformed into a changing table.  Bottles and pacifiers lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers.  Underneath, a clothes line of baby clothes. 
The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence.  The camera follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs.  An exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock.  He swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back to sleep. 
SAM Didn't you just fall asleep, little girl? (Lucy cries harder) Okay, if you say it's time to get up, then it's time to get up, time to get up. (Sam sniffs the air) Oh my, oh my, oh my.  Quite a bit of business. 
He rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with promotional buttons: one says "Hertz, #1 for Car Rentals", the other a picture of Magic Johnson and reads "Go, Lakers, Go!"  Sam undoes it. 
SAM (CONT'D) Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  Let me see let me see let me see. 
Sam attempts to clean and diaper her.  He finally manages to pin the buttons so that it at least stays on. 
SAM (CONT'D) You look very beautiful this morning, very beautiful. 
He holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles. 
CUT TO: 
We pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf: 
HUGGIES, PAMPERS, EXTRA ABSORBENT PAMPERS, LUVS... 
INT. WALMART - DAY 
Sam stares at the "Great Wall of Diapers", awed.  He reaches for the Pampers, balancing Lucy, then the Luvs, no, the Huggies.  Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in place.  Sam decides on one of each.  He heads to the FORMULA AISLE.  Gerber, Carnation, Carnation Iron Fortified.  He stops.  Lucy WAILS.  WE HEAR THE SONG "HELP, I NEED SOMEBODY" 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 9 P.M. 
Sam paces, carrying Lucy who screams at the top of her lungs. 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 11:25 P.M. 
Sam rocks the CRYING BABY in the hammock.  He's exhausted, but she's just getting started.  He puts another blanket on her. 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 1:30 A.M. 
Peace.  A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate. He tiptoes, his FIST raised victoriously - "YES!"  He doesn't get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming.  Defeated, he picks her up.  HELP.  The PHONE RINGS.  HE PRESSES speaker.

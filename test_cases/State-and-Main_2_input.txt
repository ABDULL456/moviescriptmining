Joe is standing by the side of the bed, holding Claire's clothes, trying to induce her to put them on.  She is sitting on the side of the bed, naked. 
JOE Look. 
CLAIRE I feel so close to you... 
JOE Look, look, I like you very much... 
CLAIRE I like you, too. 
JOE But not that way... 
CLAIRE But we... 
JOE Look, look there's someone else... 
Sound of a KNOCK at the door. 
JOE (CONT'D) Great.  Who is it? 
ANN (O.S.) "Room Service!" 
JOE (to Claire) Would you go in... 
He gestures to the bathroom, he hands her her clothes. 
JOE (CONT'D) Would you put on your cl... (to door) Just leave it outside 
ANN You have to sign for it. 
INT. HALL - NIGHT 
Ann hurriedly arranging the flowers in the "platen" of the typewriter.  From inside the room we hear Joe's voice: "Alright, one moment!"  He opens the door. 
ANN I'm gonna be your typist for this evening. 
JOE Oh, G-d... 
ANN And here's some hydrogen peroxide... 
JOE I don't drink. 
ANN It's for your finger. 
JOE One moment. 
He closes the door. 
INT. JOE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Claire is still sitting on the bed, has a lit cigarette. Poured herself a drink.  Joe goes over to her, thrusts her clothes on the floor. 
JOE You have to hide. 
CLAIRE Who is that? 
JOE That's my... 
CLAIRE Oh. 
JOE Will you help me out...? 
CLAIRE I... 
Joe hustles back to the door.  Opens the door.  Ann is still standing there with the typewriter. 
JOE Hi. 
ANN You going to ask me in? 
Joe looks back over his shoulder. 
ANN (CONT'D) Thought you might like this. 
She hands him a bouquet. 
JOE (takes flowers) Thank you. 
ANN Read the card. 
JOE (reading card) "To the love of my life, Love, Doug." 
ANN The other side. 
JOE Oh. 
He turns the card over. 
ANN Don't you think you should put them in water. 
JOE Why? 
ANN ...because if you don't, they die. 
She goes into the bathroom, fills up the vase.  Comes out. 
ANN (CONT'D) Shouldn't we start?

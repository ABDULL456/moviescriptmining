In the jar, the ENCHANTED ROSE hangs in mid-air. The rose is wilting. Most of its petals have fallen. Rage evaporating, replaced by shame, the beast lowers his head... 
... as ONE MORE PETAL DROPS. 
The image moves inside the jar. We see the beast through the glass as he leans down, peering in at the petal as it reaches the bottom and shrivels. As it does, we hear a far off RUMBLE, as if the foundation of the castle is trembling. 
EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT -- DAWN 
From a distance, we see stone statuary crack and tumble down from the castle walls... 
53   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                  53 
The staff is gathered; the beginning of their evening. Lumière lights the fireplace. He hears the crash of falling debris. 
LUMIÈRE Another petal fell... 
PLUMETTE Lumière, I grew three more feathers! And I just plucked yesterday. 
Lumière moves to help, but his legs stiffen.    He holds his flame to his knee like a heating pad. 
LUMIÈRE I know, darling -- Ow! I'm getting more metallic every day. 
Suddenly, Cogsworth begins making clock sounds. 
COGSWORTH Oh, no! It's -- tick tock! -- happening again -- cuckoo! Pardon me. 
MRS. POTTS Everyone, calm yourselves.    We still have time. 
CHIP Mama, am I ever going to be a boy again? 
MRS. POTTS Yes, Chip.     You'll have your days in the sun again.     You just leave it to me. 
54   EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT                                         54 
Belle throws her makeshift rope out the bedroom window. 
55   INT. BELLE'S BEDROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                       55 
Belle looks down -- the rope is about 20 feet off the ground. Almost there. A KNOCK on the door. 
BELLE I told you to go away. 
MRS. POTTS (O.S.) Don't worry, dear. It's only Mrs. Potts. 
Mrs. Potts bustles in on her cart with Chip. 
MRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Oh, aren't you a vision! How lovely to make your acquaintance. 
Belle tries to block her view of the escape rope, but Mrs. Potts is too sharp. 
MRS. POTTS (CONT'D) It's a very long journey. Let me fix you up before you go. I have found that most troubles seem less troubling after a bracing cup o' tea. 
The tea is poured into Chip, who wheels over to Belle. 
MRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Slowly now, Chip. 
Belle picks up Chip and brings him up to her mouth. Little Chip finds himself face-to-face with the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. She takes a sip. 
CHIP Pleased to meet you!    Want to see me do a trick? 
Chip blows a huge bubble in his tea cup.     It pops loudly. 
MRS. POTTS Chip. (to Belle) That was a very brave thing you did for your father, dear. 
Madame Garderobe's doors swing open. 
GARDEROBE Yes.    We all think so. 
BELLE I'm so worried about him.      He's never been on his own. 
MRS. POTTS Cheer up, my poppet. Things will turn out in the end. You'll feel a lot better after dinner. 
BELLE But he said, "If she doesn't eat with me, she doesn't eat at all." 
MRS. POTTS People say a lot of things in anger. It is our choice whether or not to listen. Coming? 
And Mrs. Potts is out the door.      Belle looks to Garderobe. 
GARDEROBE Go. 
INT. KITCHEN - CASTLE - NIGHT 
The door opens.   Lumière races in to the excited staff.

(Opens when the camera is underwater.) 
Voice Who am I? I've been dreaming about this world which doesn't exist in my memory. (Mew swims by) Who are you? Wait! Am I apart of you...? Or not...? (Camera goes into a darker place with orange bubbles then it shows someone's eye open. Human figures are seen outside where he is.) Where is this? Who am I? Who brought me here? (We now see who the voice belongs to, it's Mewtwo.) 
Mewtwo Who am I and why am I here? I just appeared here. I haven't even been born to this world yet. Who am I? (Mewtwo opens his eyes completely and shatters the glass and all the wires fall of him!) 
Scientist It has awakened! 
Mewtwo Did he do this? 
Scientist Wonderful! Mewtwo has been completed. 
Mewtwo Mewtwo?

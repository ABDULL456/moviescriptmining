WIDER 
Eric tries to stand.  He cries out and falls into the powdery snow, clutching at his ankle. (CONTINUED) 94   CONTINUED: 
Corbett realizes Eric is at a disadvantage.  But before he can bolt, Eric grabs for the .357 magnum under his coat.  He lies on the snow, gasping, pointing the gun at Corbett's midsection. ERIC Stay put! CORBETT You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger? 
Eric cocks the gun's hammer with his thumb. ERIC Be no different than shooting a rabid dog. 
The men face off for a tense moment. 
Corbett smiles and zips up his jacket, dispelling the tension.  Letting the hammer down, Eric looks back at the burning plane. ERIC (continuing) Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me. CORBETT I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory. ERIC With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory. CORBETT You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain. 
Corbett drops his facade of conviviality.  Eric is too angry to be intimidated.  He takes the scarf from around his neck and wraps his ankle with it. ERIC Let's go. (CONTINUED) 94   CONTINUED:  (2) CORBETT (re Eric's ankle) I'm not gonna carry you out of here. ERIC That's right.  You're not. CORBETT Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together. 
ERIC Forget it. 
Eric holds his wristwatch up, points the hour hand at the sun, counts forward to noon, and, accordingly, makes an approximation of their direction. ERIC (continuing) Last time I checked the flight plan, we were forty miles northeast of Devil's Cauldron. Southwest is that way.  No sense waiting for a goddamn taxi. 
Grimacing with pain, he gets up.  Clutching the magnum, he shoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking.  Corbett frowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with his arms cuffed tightly behind his back. 
Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register on his face.  They wouldn't be farther from the rest of humanity on another planet.  Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett enjoys the view.  And waits. 
95   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAY 
The Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and gnarled tundra valleys.  Squinting in the glare of the snow, Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the Arctic area.  The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won, snow-covered mile behind them. 
Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding mosaics upon the landscape.  The air is still.  The silence 
is itself a disconcerting presence.  Ten miles ahead and two thousand feet lower, the forest begins.  But here, on the rock face of the mountains, Eric and Corbett might as well be in a desert. (CONTINUED) 95   CONTINUED: ERIC It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood. CORBETT Welcome to the environment, Mr. Ecology.  Out here, one mistake is all you get. 
Determined and dour, Eric pushes on. CORBETT (continuing) Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in? ERIC I don't plan on dying. 
It's all academic.  The sheer magnitude of the surroundings makes them feel they're the only people in the world. DISSOLVE TO: 
96   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DUSK 
The sun drops behind the mountains.  A wind whips up, chilling the men through their clothing.  Eric tries not to shiver.  He spies a small rock formation with a granite elbow protruding from it, making an enclosed triangle of solid rock. ERIC We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter. CORBETT Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down. 
Corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while Eric digs near the rocks.  Although he knows Corbett is testing his every move, Eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him. CORBETT (continuing) Even in the drifts, this snow's too powdery to make a shelter. When you're done jerking around, reach down the back of my coat. 
Eric approaches him suspiciously.  He puts his hand down through Corbett's collar.  Something is stowed inside a homemade flap in the lining of his coat.  Eric pulls out a (CONTINUED) 96   CONTINUED: 
folded nylon tarp with twine threaded through corner eyeholes.  He shakes the eight by eight orange tarp open... CUT TO: 
97   EXT.  NYLON SHELTER - EVENING 
Eric and Corbett have stretched the tarp out tent-style next to the granite rock formation, making a minimal but functional refuge from the cold night.

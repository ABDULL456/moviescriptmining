And once again, the LIGHT TENDRILS STAB THROUGH QUILL'S BACK, thrusting him to his knees. 
Smaller light tendrils stab into his face and body. 
And we see the LIGHT being sucked out of Quill and up into the Self Chamber once more as it BURSTS WITH LIGHT. 
EARTH - EXT. STREET - DAY 
POLICE OFFICERS and bystanders are in the streets, snapping phone photos, etc, beside the HUGE, STILL SWATCH OF EGO'S LIFEFORM. 
OFFICER FITZGIBBON Please, everyone. Step back. I need you all to clear the - 
WEIRD OLD MAN What is that? 
The LIFEFORM ALIGHTS WITH ENERGY and MOVES again, SPILLING INCREDIBLY QUICKLY towards them. 
People abandon their cars in traffic as it RUNS OVER THEM. 
A WOMAN FALLS. People TRAMPLE around her. 
But an old man's hands reach in, helping her up. 
REVEAL GRANDPA QUILL, in his 70's or 80's now. 
GRANDPA QUILL Come on, ma'am. 
He HELPS the woman into an SUV. 
He SLAMS on the gas, SCREECHING AWAY from the enormous tidal wave of organic light. 
XANDAR - I/E. STARBLASTER/CITY - DAY 
EGO'S LIFEFORM smashes down the PARK WALLS and into the street. 
EGO (O.S) It doesn't need to be like this PETER 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Ego approaches his son. 
EGO Why are you destroying our chance?! 
AAKON - EXT. AAKON CITY - NIGHT 
AAKONS run from a giant wave behind them. 
EGO (O.S) Stop pretending you aren't, what you are! 
KREE HOMEWORLD - EXT. STEEP HILLSIDE - DAY 
KREE MONKS run from the cosmic flesh as it pours down the hillside behind them. 
But it's too fast, RUSHING OVER THEM. 
PRIMITIVE PLANET - EXT. WETLANDS - DAY 
THOUSANDS OF ORLONI are darting in fear across this dusty desert, as it WASHES OVER them. 
EGO (O.S) One in billions.. 
ARAGO-7 - EXT. STONY LANDSCAPE - DAY 
THREE HURCTARIANS run, SCREAMING. 
EGO (O.S) Trillions, even more! 
EASIK - EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 
AN EASIK MOTHER clutches her BABY, covering it with her own body, as the spreading lifeform LOOMS UP behind her. 
She closes her eyes and waits for the worst. 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Quill looks up at Ego, barely able to focus, as the molecules form skin over the muscle and skeleton and innards beneath. 
EGO What greater meaning could life possibly have to offer?! 
Yondu struggles beneath the tentacle beside Quill. 
YONDU I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy! I use my h - 
Quill hears this as the earth COVERS Yondu's face. 
Quill LOOKS INWARD. And suddenly, everything becomes... 
QUIET. 
Tears come to Peter Quill's eyes as he remember those around him and what they mean to him. And we see his MEMORIES. 
- YOUNG PETER QUILL AND HIS MOTHER CUDDLED AND LISTENING TO MUSIC ON THE WALKMAN TOGETHER, EACH WITH ONE EAR PIECE. 
- QUILL AND DRAX LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ON THE MILANO. 
- GAMORA AND PETER LOOKING INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES AND DANCING ON KNOWHERE. 
- QUILL AND ROCKET FLYING THROUGH THE SKY ON AERO-RIGS FOR THE FIRST TIME, SMILING AS THE AIR RUSHES THROUGH THEIR HAIR. BABY GROOT CLUTCHES HAPPILY ONTO QUILL'S BACK. 
- YONDU AND YOUNG QUILL IN THE FOREST. YONDU'S ARM IS ON PETER'S ARM AS HE TEACHES HIM HOW TO SHOOT. 
Quill looks back up at Ego as we HEAR the gentle chords of FLEETWOOD MAC'S "THE CHAIN" starts echoing throughout the hollow. 
He clutches his fist and we see the light growing within it. 
Bits of earth begin to ROLL UP AND SCRAMBLE AND SWIRL around Quill's body, his arms, his legs, as if he's pulling them towards himself with magnets. 
And Ego looks confused, as the GROUND QUAKES AROUND HIM. 
Quill glares at his father, his voice distorting with Celestial thunder. 
QUILL You shouldn't have killed my mom and squished my walkman. 
Ahd a SOLID TORNADO OF EARTH PROPELS QUILL FORWARD. Ego tries to protect himself as Quill SLAMS into him, FLYING UPWARDS WITH HIM -- 
Quill raises his fist, NOW A GIANT CLUB.   And he SMASHES Ego.

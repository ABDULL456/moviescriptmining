MARTY Hey, Mac! 
CAMERA ANGLES to include the PROPRIETOR of the luncheonette. He is sitting in one of the booths ahead reading the Sunday Mirror. He looks up toward Marty. 
MARTY You gotta Ladies' Room around here? 
PROPRIETOR Inna back. 
MARTY (to Clara) Inna back. 
Clara smiles at this innocent gaucherie, then edges out of the booth, taking her purse with her. 
187TH STREET. NIGHT. 
HIGH ANGLE SHOT of Angie meandering down the street on which the neighborhood bar is located. It is near midnight, and the street is empty except for Angie and the CLACKING of his leather heels on the pavement. He comes to the bar, opens the door, enters... 
THE BAR. NIGHT. 
The SOUNDS of Saturday night revelry are loud, coming mostly from the Irish contingent of the neighborhood. They are grouped along practically the whole bar. Three or four WOMEN and a number of shirtsleeved MEN, mostly in their late forties, early fifties. We know they're Irish, because one of the younger men is chanting an auld country ballad. 
CAMERA ANGLES disclose the entrance to the bar in the background, showing Angie coming in, looking here and there. He starts toward the bar. 
NEAR BAR. 
TWO IRISH WOMEN, middle-aged, squat heavily on bar stools over their schooners of beer, gassing away at each other. 
FIRST IRISH WOMAN ...so she told me that the doctor told her that if she had any more babies, she would do so at the risk of her life... 
Angie shuffles in, pausing near the bar and standing behind the two Irish women. 
SECOND IRISH WOMAN She was always a bit thin in the hips... 
FIRST IRISH WOMAN Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either... 
ANGIE Hey, Lou! 
FIRST IRISH WOMAN ...going to the hospital or coming from it. She was hatching them out like eggs. 
SECOND IRISH WOMAN And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he? 
FIRST IRISH WOMAN Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel. 
ANGIE (loudly) Hey, Lou! 
CAMERA ANGLES to include Lou, the Bartender. 
BARTENDER (looking up from opening a batch of beer bottles) What? 
FIRST IRISH WOMAN ...so I said to her, "Mary... 
ANGIE (calling to the Bartender) Marty been in here the last coupla hours or so?

BOURNE'S POV 
Watching PAZ from the platform as he SAGS down onto a seat, nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding...He takes out the PILLS and dry-swallows them...Looks up... 
CLOSE ON -- BOURNE 
Watching PAZ...As if he's looking in the MIRROR at his old self...The self before THE BOURNE IDENTITY... 
CLOSE ON -- PAZ 
He looks straight ahead, just another commuter... 
BACK ON -- BOURNE 
Watching PAZ, as the train pulls away...Then BOURNE is immediately in motion... 
119    INT. DAY. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE -- CIA -- LANGLEY, VA             119 
KRAMER Hello. 
VOSEN It's Vosen. We have a situation. 
119B   EXT. NIGHT.   DANIELS OFFICE -- MADRID                    119B 
Establishing Sewell and Marbury. 
120    INT. NIGHT. DANIELS OFFICE                                    120 
DANIELS watches news of ROSS murder on TV. DANIELS panics, opens his safe, packs up papers, takes Blackbriar FILE. Sets alarm. Leaves. 
120C   EXT. NIGHT. INTERNET CAFE -- LONDON.                      120C 
BOURNE sits at a computer, the ROSS notebook open in front of him. He pages through it, finding names, places, "HOW DID THIS ALL START?" -- and Blackbriar.   He Googles "Sewell and Marbury"-- finds Paris, Berlin, Madrid. BOURNE continues to search and finds receipt from Madrid. 
BOURNE leaves. 
123    EXT. DAY.   POSH HOTEL -- NEW YORK CITY                       123 
LANDY steps out of a TAXI... 
123A   INT. DAY.   POSH HOTEL -- NEW YORK CITY                   123A 
Vosen's sitting. 
VOSEN (to waiter) Sparkling. And a "Heart-Healthy" omelet with goat cheese and peppers. 
Landy arrives. 
VOSEN You're late. Traffic? 
WAITER (handing her the menu) Ma'am? 
LANDY Nothing for me. 
Vosen looks at her, surprised. 
VOSEN I'm buying. 
She shakes her head, no. She sits, without taking her coat off. She's not staying long. 
VOSEN When the Director called, it was suggested we bring you on-- 
LANDY Suggested? (beat) Are you sure it was just a suggestion? 
VOSEN Funny how different things look depending on where you sit. I look at this as doing a favor for you. Giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business. 
LANDY Meaning? 
VOSEN Jason Bourne. 
LANDY Bourne's finished. 
VOSEN Really? 
LANDY It was finished the moment I realized I was chasing him for something he didn't do.   The case is closed. 
VOSEN So what do you make of this? (handing her surveillance photos of Bourne in Paris) French intel picked up Bourne meeting Pierre Elattrache on Tuesday. He threatened to burn our house down if you didn't tell him who started Treadstone. That's a big problem, wouldn't you agree? 
LANDY This doesn't feel like Bourne to me. 
VOSEN Why's it so hard for you to believe? 
LANDY Probably because it's coming from you, Noah. 
VOSEN Lets try and be adults okay? We all thought he was done, off the grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe he's a threat. We both want the same thing here. 
LANDY So what happened at Waterloo? 
VOSEN We have a leak. Bourne showed up in our surveillance. We had very little time to react.

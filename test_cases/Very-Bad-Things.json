{"test1_input": "MICHAEL Just go ahead and say what's on your mind. \nBOYD Speak from the heart my brother. \nAdam turns in disgust. \nADAM This is pathetic. \nMICHAEL You're pathetic. \nADAM (turning on Michael) What did you say? \nMICHAEL (pointing) You're not a team player. \nADAM Don't point at me. \nMICHAEL You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends. \nADAM I have plenty of friends. \nMICHAEL The hell you do. \nADAM The hell I don't. \nMICHAEL You have acquaintances -- business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems. \nADAM What are you fucking talking about? \nMichael looks at Boyd. \nFISHER Michael, now is probably not the best time for this. \nBOYD No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you... (points to Adam) ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker. \nDEAD SILENCE. Adam stares stupefied at Boyd, then Michael. Finally, Fisher says his prayer. \nFISHER Dear God, please forgive us for what we have done here tonight. We have lost our way. Speaking for myself, let me say... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MINIVAN - DRIVING \nFisher's prayer over the guys driving home. Each lost in his own thoughts. \nFISHER (V.O.) ...I am deeply in love with the woman I am about to marry and I look very much forward to raising a family and being a positive member of society. We promise, if you forgive us, we will never forget this tragedy and will try with all our powers to use it as a daily reminder that we are here on earth to do good not evil. Let us go from this day forward with new purpose and spirit. You have given us a second chance and let us take that second chance and use it as fuel to feed our fires of productivity so that the spirits of the two we now bury live on forever in the good deeds and positive achievements we from this moment on shall make our life's work... \nContinue as the minivan disappears down the freeway, heading back to Los Angeles. A freeway sign reads, \"Los Angeles, 358 miles.\" \nFISHER (V.O.) Thank you lord, and again, we ask for your forgiveness and guidance... Amen. \nEXT. CAR WASH - DAY \nAdam watches his mini-van move through the wash and rinse cycle, staring, paranoid at the Mexican Towel Boy cleaning the interior. \nMICHAEL tries to open a child proof bottle of Excedrin. \nBOYD plays \"Mrs. Pac-man\" in the corner. \nMEN'S ROOM \nMoore dry heaves for all he's worth. \nPAY PHONE \nFisher finishes dialing, waits... Finally... \nLIZ (V.O.) Hello. \nFISHER Hey. It's me. \nLIZ (V.O.) Where are you? \nFISHER We're on our way home. I just... we're running a little late. \nLIZ (V.O.) How late? \nFISHER No. Just like an hour or so. \nLIZ (V.O.) What about the chairs? \nFISHER Okay. \nLIZ (V.O.) What okay? \n", "test1_true": "LIZ (V.O.) The chairs. \nFISHER I left a message. I think it's going to be okay. \nLIZ (V.O.) You sound funny. Did you do cocaine? \nFISHER No. No. I'll see you in about four hours. \nAs he hangs up the phone... \nLIZ (V.O.) (distant; unheard) Do you love me? \nCLICK. Fisher, in a daze, turns and walks into right into Adam who has been standing there listening. Adam doesn't look so good. \nADAM I want you to hear me out. \nFISHER What. \nADAM You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent. \nFISHER I don't think so. \nADAM We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves. \nThe HISPANIC CAR WASH WORKER beeps the horn, Adam jumps. The van is ready. \nBOYD Let's go! \nAdam stares daggers into Fisher. \nADAM We save ourselves. It's our only chance. \nAdam heads back to the car, leaving Fisher alone. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe shiny clean minivan cruises to a stop in front of the house. Adam Jr., \"Little Adam,\" and Timmy play in the fenced yard along with a couple of other kids. \nINT. MINIVAN \nAdam stops the car. The guys sit in silence as the kids assault the truck, climbing all over it. Little Adam waves his crutches wildly. \nADAM JR. (screaming) Daddy's home! Daddy's home! \nBoyd addresses the fellas. \nBOYD The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives. \nMOORE Today is the best day of the rest of our lives. \nFISHER (disgusted) The first day. \nMOORE What? \nAs Lois, with camera, and Liz, come out the front door. \nFISHER (disgusted & depressed) It goes; \"Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.\" \nBOYD However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right?... Right? \nMICHAEL Right. \nMOORE That's right. \nAs the little kids put their lips up to the windows, making funny faces, \nBOYD You're goddamn right. Adam? \nAdam is silent, watching the beautiful chaos that is his family. \nADAM (reluctant) Right. \nEXT. SUBURBAN \nAs the guys get out and are mauled by the hyper kids and Lois and Liz. \nLOIS (with camera) Group shot. Here we go boys! Yes sir, compare and contrast time! \nShe starts herding the boys into a group pose. \n", "test1_id": 1149, "test2_input": "FISHER What are you talking about? \nBARRY MORRIS I'm talking about Life insurance. I'm talking about money. \nLIZ Money? \nBARRY MORRIS Yes money. Adam had a five hundred thousand dollar Term Life Insurance Policy. \nPAUSE. \nLIZ What does that mean? \nFISHER That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids. \nLIZ (amazed) No. \nFISHER Yes. \nBARRY MORRIS Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam... and failed to make his last payment... so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void. (off Liz's horror) Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand. \nLIZ (relieved) Well, oh... \nBARRY MORRIS And a house. Valued at 350 thousand. \nLIZ So where's that leave us? \nFISHER 150 plus 350... we still get 500 thousand. \nBARRY MORRIS (beat) No. Not even close. With property values down, the house is worth 100,000 less than 450 he paid for it. With three credit cards, the minivan payments, and other outstanding debts... Plus the Income and Estate Taxes assessed on his IRA... (punches his calculator) You'll get, oh... in the neighborhood of, ah... 14,223 dollars. \nAdam Jr. suddenly slips off his chair, lands flat on his back, starts struggling to get up. Fisher tries to help Little Adam up. \nLITTLE ADAM Get away from me! \nFISHER I'm just trying to help... \nLITTLE ADAM I don't want your help! \nFISHER Stop kicking. Stop kicking! \nFisher manages to get Adam Jr. back up in his chair. Liz looks rather horrified. \nBARRY MORRIS (breaking the tension) So. When is the wedding. \nLIZ Tomorrow (at Fisher) We are getting married tomorrow. \nINT. CAR \nFisher drives, Liz up front, Adam jr. and Timmy in the back. Everyone is shocked in silence. Fisher looks deathly ill, like he's about to vomit. He pulls the car over and gets out. \nEXT. FISHER'S CAR \nFisher leans on the trunk, puking. Liz gets out to help him, he starts crying. Liz is gentle and loving. \nLIZ It's okay... It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama. \nFISHER No it's not okay. It's not. \nThe kids watch from the rear view window but can't hear. \nLIZ Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay. \nFISHER (sobbing) Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off. \nLIZ (ice) Don't even. \nFISHER Do you love me? \nLIZ What? \nFISHER Do you love me? \nLIZ What kind of stupid question is that? \nFISHER (breaking down) Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We... \nLIZ What are you talking about? \nFISHER (completely hysterical) Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Michael crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident. \nLIZ Who's dead? \nFISHER The prostitute. \n", "test2_true": "FISHER No Michael did. It was an accident. \nLIZ You killed a prostitute. \nFISHER Michael, by accident. \nLIZ Call the police. \nFISHER It's too late. \nLIZ My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she? \nFISHER She's in the desert. She's out in the desert. \nLIZ You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone? \nFISHER She's not alone... She's... Boyd... Oh God... He's gone nuts... He killed Lois and Michael... it's all... \nLIZ Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned. \nFISHER But... \nLIZ No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses. \nFISHER But... \nLIZ No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water! \nLiz marches back to the car, gets in and slams the door. Fisher just stares in shock. \nEXT./INT. CHURCH - FISHER AND LIZ'S WEDDING \nIt's pouring rain outside. \nShots of guests dashing from their cars to the church. \nFisher's parents with Adam Jr. and Timmy, looking overwhelmed. \nUpstairs: Liz and her Bridesmaids help Liz get dressed. Everyone looks depressed. \nINT. CHURCH BASEMENT \nFisher and Moore in tuxedos. Boyd enters, shuts the door. Fisher looks ill. \nBOYD Okay, we're about two minutes out. Moore, better take your position. \nMoore looks at Fisher. \nBOYD Chop chop. \nMoore goes. A long tense BEAT between Fisher and Boyd. \nBOYD This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most. \nFISHER I'm getting really tired of your bullshit. \nBOYD My what? \nFISHER You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly. \nBOYD You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation? \nFISHER (snaps) I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things! \nBOYD Okay fine. \nFISHER Fine? Fine what? \nBOYD Whatever you say Kojak. \nFISHER I'm serious. \nBOYD I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money. \nINT. CHURCH \nThe organ is playing. The guests are seated. Liz and her father are waiting in the front hall. \nLIZ I told Boyd two fucking minutes! \nINT. CHURCH BASEMENT - CONT'D \n", "test2_id": 1150, "test3_input": "FISHER What money? \nBOYD Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive. \nFISHER You're sick. \nBOYD (veins pulsing) And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money! \nFISHER Not a prayer. \nBOYD I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark! \nFISHER You need help. \nFisher turns away. BOYD combusts. He leaps on Fisher with a wild cry. \nBOYD I want that money! \nBoyd and fisher fight like animals; choking, pounding, mauling, a fight to the death. Fisher is losing, Boyd is choking the life out of him, killing him. Fisher is going down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until... \nCRASH. Boyd's head is caved in from behind. REVEAL Liz wielding a big, heavy crucifix. Boyd slumps to the ground. Fisher gasps for air. Boyd stirs. Liz beats him repeatedly with the crucifix until he's dead as a door knob. Fisher is stunned. Liz tosses the cross. Miraculously, only one perfect droplet of blood has gotten on her wedding dress. She flicks it off with her finger. \nLIZ (composing herself) Here comes the bride. \nLiz gathers up her train and marches out. Fisher looks at Boyd, a bloody dead mess. \nTHE WEDDING \nFisher joins Moore at the alter. JUDGE TOWER smiles warmly at Fisher. \nMOORE Where's Boyd? \nFISHER (whispers) Downstairs in the closet. \nBefore Moore can ask, the ORGAN begins playing the WEDDING MARCH. Liz starts down the aisle, escorted by her father, She smiles radiantly. \nLiz's father kisses her and gives her to Fisher. They stand before the Judge who starts talking. TIGHT ON Fisher. His head pounding. He hears none of what the Judge says until... \nJUDGE TOWER May we have the rings please? \nFISHER What? \nJUDGE TOWER The rings? \nFisher looks at Moore. \nINT. CHURCH BASEMENT \nMoore opens the closet. Boyd falls out. \nINT. CHURCH \nEveryone waits patiently. Fisher is sweating. He looks at Liz who stares straight ahead. \nINT. CHURCH BASEMENT \nMoore rolls Boyd over, checks every pocket, trying not to get blood on himself. \nINT. CHURCH \nMoore returns. \nMOORE Got 'em. \nHe hands the rings to the Judge, at which time, he, she, Fisher and Liz all see blood on his white shirt cuff. The Judge looks at Moore. He pulls his jacket sleeve down. \nJUDGE TOWER (continues) These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part? \nFISHER I do. \nLiz slides the ring on Fisher's finger. \nJUDGE TOWER Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part? \nLIZ I do. \nFisher slides the ring on Liz's finger. \nJUDGE TOWER I now pronounce you husband and wife. \nFisher kisses Liz. They turn to face their guests who applaud. Liz cries tears of joy. \nWEDDING RECEPTION - TENT NEXT TO CHURCH \n", "test3_true": "EXT. CHURCH - REAR \nFisher and Moore load Boyd's body in the trunk of Fisher's car. \nMOORE He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his. \nFISHER My God... \nMOORE He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading \"Atlas Shrugged,\" staring at himself in the mirror. \nFISHER Did he try to kiss you? \nMOORE All week long. \nFisher slams the trunk closed. \nWEDDING RECEPTION - MUCH LATER \nOnly a few guests remain. Fisher's parents watch the boys. The caterers are cleaning up. Fisher and Liz sit alone. \nFISHER He kept saying he was protected. \nLIZ What does that mean? \nFISHER Like if something happened to him, he could still get us. \nLIZ Like how? \nFISHER I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried. \nLIZ The only proof is those bodies. \nFISHER So what do we do? \nLIZ Move the bodies. \nFISHER Move the bodies? \nOLD MAN (O.S.) Excuse us? \nFisher and Liz look up at a sweet OLD COUPLE, who talk at the same time, oblivious to each other. \nOLD MAN We just wanted to say congratulations and wish you great happiness. Mazeltov. I just did. I said Malzeltov. You never listen to me. \nOLD WOMAN We're your Uncle Henry's parents. Opal and Earl. Tell them from both of us. Malzeltov. Wish them luck. The secret to a good marriage is to listen. \nLIZ (cheerleader smile) Thank you. Thank you. We will. Bye bye. \nThe Old Couple shuffles away. Fisher watches them go, he suddenly breaks down, crying... \nFISHER I... Liz... all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of... (sobs) ...I just love you so much... So much... \nLIZ (beat; unmoved) You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too. \nFISHER What? \nLIZ If you don't tie up all the lose ends it'll never be over. \nFISHER (horrified) No... \nLIZ You put him down or don't bother coming back. \nFISHER But... \nLIZ Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?! \nOFF Fisher... \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nFisher's car blasts past a road sign reading, \"Las Vegas, 358 miles.\" \nINT. FISHER'S CAR \nFisher drives, Moore's in the passenger seat. They're still in their tuxedos. Extreme silence. Fisher, almost in a trance. \nMOORE You alright? \nFISHER Yeah. I'm thinking about Michael's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Michael was always harping \"Immaculate Reception?\" I've seen that play. A lot of times... and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me? \nMOORE I guess. \n", "test3_id": 1151}

{"train": "\"VERY BAD THINGS\" \nby \nPeter Berg \nSeptember 2, 1997 \nFADE IN: \nTITLE SEQUENCE \nTHE DEAD OF NIGHT \nPitch black. Dead quiet. Dim faint light appears in the distance, approaching, growing larger. As the light nears, we recognize car headlights. Closer and closer until the car is bearing down upon us with great force... \nINT. CAR \nTwo men in the front seat, FISHER and MOORE. Fisher drives. All seems quite normal until we take a closer look, sweat matts hair, dirt stains on white tuxedo shirts hands are blistered and bloody. They seem almost entranced. \nMOORE That ought to be about the end of that. \nFISHER Yup. \nSILENCE. PUSH IN ON Fisher... \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) \"The Oakland Raiders have taken a 7 - 6 lead in a, tough, football game and this crowd is standing...\" \nFISHER'S VISION - GRAINY - OUT OF THE PAST THREE RIVER STADIUM - DECEMBER 23RD, 1972 \nPlayoff game between the Oakland Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Scoreboard reads: 22 seconds, 4th down, 10 yards to go, 4th quarter. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) \"Hang on to your hats, here come the Steelers out of the Huddle...\" \nINT. CAR - FISHER \ntransfixed... \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) \"It comes down to one big play, 4th down, ten yards to go. Terry Bradshaw at the controls...\" \nBradshaw throws. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) \"And Bradshaw, back and looking...Again, Bradshaw running out of the pocket... Looking for someone to throw to...\" \nBradshaw throws. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...Bradshaw fires it down the field and there's a collision!...\" \nThe ball bounces off the helmet of a Raider player and is caught low by the Steelers' FRANCO HARRIS. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) \"...and it's caught out of the air! The ball is pulled in by Franco Harris!\" \nFISHER - DRIVING \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Franco Harris running for the end zone, all but home...\" \nOncoming headlights illuminate Fisher's face... \nEND TITLES. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nFADE IN ON: \nINT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - MARRIAGE LICENSE DEPT. - DAY \nSLOWLY TRACKING down a long line of couples. Some with kids, some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick up their marriage license. \nWe HOLD on a young couple, late 20's, KEITH FISHER and his fiancee, LIZ GARRETY. Fisher has a blondish quality to him, unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he could be. Liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow moving line. \nLIZ This is ridiculous. \nFISHER Government cutbacks. \nLIZ Why can't we do it through the mail? \nFISHER (patient) We missed the deadline. \nLIZ Can't we do it on the phone? \nFISHER I don't think so. \nIn front of them a middle-aged MEXICAN COUPLE make-out intensely while their chubby little THREE YEAR OLD stares at Liz. \nLIZ Well it's bad timing. \nFISHER How do you figure? \nLIZ Right before the wedding? \nFISHER It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding. \nLIZ I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this. \nFISHER He is. \nLIZ He's a moron. \nFISHER He's my friend. He's not a moron. \nLIZ David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas. \nEXT. SANTA MONICA \nTIGHT ON a \"Fred Sands\" realty sign being pounded into the ground. Pictured on the sign, as \"offered by,\" is realtor DAVID BOYD, 30-ish, short hair, smiling with bizarre sincerity. \nWIDER to reveal, David Boyd in the flesh, suit jacket off, pounding away, sinking the sign into the front yard of a cute little house. His CELL PHONE RINGS. Boyd, gets the phone from his jacket. \nBOYD (into phone) David Boyd. Tina. Great. Okay. Here's the deal, we're talking five guys. Hard Rock. Nice guys Tina. My friends. Yeah. I'm calling you directly so you don't have to go through the agency... (suddenly, over his shoulder) HEY! DO NOT ENTER THE HOUSE! (back into phone) That's correct. Cash straight to you. Yes. Twelve hundred? I don't think so. It's just stripping. Just a show. Hold on. (O.C.) Could you please wait off the property? \nANGLE ON A YOUNG COUPLE, obviously here to see the house. \nMAN We're just trying to sneak a peak. \nBOYD Just stay off the property until I'm off the phone. \nMAN Why? \nBOYD Cause that's the way they do it. \nBewildered and somewhat intimidated, they back off. \nBOYD (back into phone) So it's five guys, Hard Rock Casino. Nine hundred bucks and you do the thing with the rubber hoses. Are you in? Tina, are you in? Good. \nBoyd hangs up, puts on his jacket and turns with the same bizarre insincere smile in his photo. Hand extended... \nBOYD David Boyd, nice to meet you. \nFISHER AND LIZ IN LINE \nLIZ Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality? \nFISHER What are you talking about? \nLIZ I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with... about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself. \nFISHER I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth. \nLIZ I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships... \nFISHER Who else? \nLIZ Charles Moore for instants. \nFISHER You don't like Moore? Since when? \nLIZ It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Growning. And I want you keeping up with me here. \nFISHER What does Moore have to do with your growing? \nLIZ I just don't see him in the big picture. \nFISHER I've known him since Cub Scouts. \nLIZ He's weird. \nFISHER He's quiet. \nLIZ He's weird. \nTIGHT ON - CHARLES MOORE \nLate twenties, a chef in a very upscale, very busy KITCHEN. His name, \"Moore,\" is embroidered on his white chef's jacket. \nFood orders fly all around as Moore works with a mesmerizing focus, a poetic sense of purpose, fifteen things going on at once; he chops, sautes, braises, etc..., in a perfect mute silence. \nFISHER AND LIZ STILL IN LINE \nADAM (to Michael) We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then. \nMICHAEL First of all... \nADAM (cuts him off) No first of all. I'm not in a game mood. \nMICHAEL You're interrupting a personal conversation. \nADAM (to Fisher) Sorry Fish. \nFISHER We'll be ready Adam. \nADAM I know you'll be. (to Michael) Three hours. \nAdam goes. \nMICHAEL I don't care for him. \nFISHER He's your brother. \nMICHAEL So? \nFisher's phone RINGS. \nFISHER (pick's up) Keith Fisher. \nINT. KITCHEN \nLiz sits at the kitchen table, in a mild panic. \nLIZ (into phone) We've got problems here. \nFISHER Problems? \nINTERCUT Liz and Fisher. \nLIZ Seating problems. \nFISHER Okay. \nLIZ Keith do not trivialize this. \nFISHER I'm not. What's the problem? \nLIZ We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded. \nFISHER What kind of seats can we have? \nLIZ Not padded ones. \nFISHER So what do we do? \nLIZ You go down there. \nFISHER Go down where? \nLIZ Go down to the seat place and straighten this out. \nFISHER Honey I don't have the time... \nLIZ I need your help. \nFISHER We're leaving in three hours. \nLIZ (starts to cry) I need your help. \nFISHER I'll call them from the road. \nLIZ Do you love me? \nFISHER More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever. \nLIZ Take care of those chairs. \nFISHER We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off. \nLIZ Maybe. \nEXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SANTA MONICA \nBOYD, MOORE, FISHER in the middle, MICHAEL and his older brother, ADAM, all in suits pose in front of Adam's brand new, state of the art, Chevy Minivan while Adam's very aggressive wife, LOIS, mired in domestic resentment, focuses her camera. \nLOIS Notice how clean and well-behaved they all appear, respectable members of modern society. Timmy, Adam Jr., take a good look at this... \nADAM Multiple reasons. \nMICHAEL Name one. \nADAM I don't have to... \nFISHER SHUT UP! \nDEAD SILENCE. As they ride through the lifeless desert, Fisher dials his cell phone. \nFISHER (into phone) Is this Pico Party rents? Can I speak to whomever is in charge of chairs? Chairs. \nBoyd checks his watch. \nBOYD Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change. \nADAM I'm not getting a ticket. \nFISHER (on cell phone) Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold. \nBOYD Who's up for making some real money? \nADAM Don't even start. \nBOYD You want to hear me out? \nMICHAEL Nope. \nBOYD Moore? \nMOORE No I don't. \nBOYD Fish? \nFISHER Not really. (into phone) Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs... \nBOYD Prison Communication Systems. (no response) An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir. \nNobody gives a fuck. \nFISHER (into phone) No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay. \nBOYD That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars. \nFISHER (into phone) We need padded chairs. \nBOYD Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English... \nADAM SHUT UP! \nMICHAEL NO! \nBOYD What is wrong with you people? I'm a helper here. \nMOORE Your investment ideas never work out. \nBOYD That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big. \nMICHAEL Your ideas never work out. \nBOYD Oh really? Starbucks? \nADAM That's one idea. \nFISHER (into phone) No... we want padded chairs... okay? \nBOYD One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars. \nADAM You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries. \nBOYD I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I? (beat) Prison Communications. \nMOORE I don't think so Boyd. \nBOYD Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir. \nHe turns away from the guys and stares out the window. \nFISHER (O.S.) Yes, I was holding for Tony in chairs. I have a chair problem. No, I'm not Tony, I need to speak to Tony. \nEXT. DESERT \nThe minivan cruises through Death Valley in route to Vegas. \nFISHER (V.O.) I'm mad at you. \nLIZ Go have fun. Not too much. \nFISHER (V.O.) I'll see you tomorrow... \nCASINO \nFisher hangs up, a \"crazy about the girl\" smile on his face. \nINT. FISHER'S SPLIT-LEVEL HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nThe MUSIC is LOUD. The boys are super drunk in the swank bachelor party suite. \nMOORE stagger-dances on a table. \nBOYD AND MICHAEL stand at the wet-bar. \nBOYD I don't hate women. \nMICHAEL You hate women. \nBOYD False. \nMICHAEL True. \nBOYD Not true. \nMICHAEL You have a King fantasy. \nBOYD I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night. \nMICHAEL And what happens when you can't? \nBOYD (swigs whiskey; looks up) New king. \nEXT. BALCONY \nAdam and Fisher. \nADAM No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me... He said, Adam, he said... He told me and I heard him... he said... (struggles to remember) Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake. \nFISHER Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father. \nADAM Are you solid with that? \nFISHER No. I think it's fucked. \nADAM Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now... You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here? \nMICHAEL AND BOYD AT THE BAR \nspeed hitting cocaine. \nBOYD If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see? \nMICHAEL Israel doesn't have a King. \nBOYD Then what do they have? \nMICHAEL They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something. \nBOYD I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot. \nMICHAEL What's your point? \nBOYD Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time... right? Am I right? \nMICHAEL The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies. \nBOYD There's my point exactly. \nMICHAEL What? What's your point? \nBOYD Take Mexico. \nMICHAEL What? \nBOYD Look up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico. \nANGLE ON \nMOORE crazed with the rhythm of the \"Chemical Brothers,\" jumps up and down on the table. \nFisher can't take it anymore... \nTina relents... moves on... \nMichael reaches for her leg like a dog in heat. \nShe passes over him, teasing, tormenting him, and settles onto Adam's lap. \nThe guys roar in approval... Michael glowers... \nAdam turns bright red as Tina arouses and rides him... \nMichael starts to burn... \nThe guys egg Tina on, she gets off on Adam's shyness, rubs her breasts in his face... \nThe guys are howling... \nTina sucks one of Adam's fingers into her mouth... \nMichael looks like he's going to explode... \nAdam's overwhelmed, he politely bails out... \nBOYD (whispers to Fish) She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party. \nFISHER I can't. \nMICHAEL (jumps up) I'll take a ride. \nFISHER Go for it. \nMICHAEL (to Tina) Come on. \nTINA (to Boyd) You said just dancing. \nBOYD (re: money) I'll take good care of you. \nTINA (dead flat; re: Michael) With him. (beat) Lucky me. \nMichael moves in on Tina. Hesitantly, she leads him into the master bedroom. \nMOORE She's fucking hot! \nADAM I need a drink. \nBOYD Tequila... \nBoyd reaches for the bottle as the beat goes on. \nHOTEL SUIT - MONTAGE \nDistorted, a bit crooked. MUSIC and DIALOGUE constantly changing levels. We're not sure who's saying what. We're not sure of physical geography. The one thing we are sure of is that MICHAEL is fucking the hell out of Tina in the bathroom. \nSERIES OF SHOTS: \nMASTER BATHROOM: \nMichael works Tina from behind. \nSUITE: \nMOORE bouncing off the furniture. \nFISHER and ADAM, wildly high. \nBOYD sprays beer on Adam, who returns fire. Drunk they start wrestling, throwing each other around the room, knocking over furniture. \nBATHROOM: \nMichael, tightly, ties Tina's hands behind her back with her rubber hose. \nTINA Oh come on. \nMICHAEL I want to play. \nTINA It's gonna cost extra. \nMICHAEL I will pay. \nSUITE: \nFisher spraying beer all over Adam and Boyd as they knock a table over and end up tangled and brawling on the floor. \nFISHER (semi-gone) What happened? Oh my God... \nMICHAEL We were playing... she slipped... she hit her head. \nADAM (incredulous) Playing? \nSUITE \nAdam moves into the living room, heads for the phone. Boyd intercepts him. They wrestle for the phone. \nBOYD Wait! \nADAM What? \nBOYD What are you doing? \nADAM (hysterical) What are you talking about? \nBOYD What do you think you are doing? \nADAM I'm calling the ambulance. \nBOYD Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing? \nADAM Calling the ambulance. \nBOYD Why? (beat) Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance? \nA reasonable point. BEAT. \nADAM We have to call the ambulance. \nBOYD Why? \nFisher entering, freaked... \nFISHER Oh, Jesus... call the police. \nBOYD No. \nFISHER She's dead. Call somebody! \nBOYD Shut up. \nFISHER Call 911. \nBOYD Shut up. \nMICHAEL She slipped. \nADAM (attacking Michael) What did you do? \nMICHAEL (defensive) You never heard of accidents?! Get off me! \nAdam slaps Michael. Moore tries to break it up. \nBOYD Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME! \nSILENCE. \nBOYD Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First... are we sure she's dead? \nADAM Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating. \nMOORE She's dead. \nMICHAEL It was an accident! \nBOYD Are you sure this was an accident? \nADAM You're a lying deviant. What did you do?! \nMICHAEL The floor was wet. She slipped! \nADAM Why was the floor wet? \nMICHAEL I don't know why the floor was wet! \nADAM Why?! \nFisher wanders back to the bathroom door where Moore is; they stare down at Tina as the conversation rages in the b.g. \nBOYD Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here. \nADAM I've got a wife and two boys. \nFisher shuffles to a corner, collapses, head in hands. SILENCE. \nBOYD (unflappably calm) Lets take a vote. A simple vote. Two choices; we clean up the mess. Right now. Bury it in the desert, go home, and never look back. Or, we can call the police... Open those doors, roll the dice and hope that it's only Michael who falls. Let's take a vote. Desert... or police? \nBOYD looks around. BEAT. Raises his hand. \nBOYD Desert. \nHe looks at MOORE. \nMOORE (beat) Fucking desert. \nMICHAEL \nMICHAEL (to Fisher) Fish, I'm really sorry. I just... I owe you man. (puts up his hand) Desert. \nAll eyes on FISHER, no response. \nBOYD Nobody knows she's here. \nFISHER Good God... Good God... \nAll eyes on ADAM. He takes a while... Finally, \nADAM How do we get her out of here? \nA reasonable question. Boyd thinks. BEAT. \nBOYD Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car... Done. \nADAM (beat) You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony? \nBOYD We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear. \nADAM What about the blood? \nBOYD Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works. \nADAM Have you ever done this before? \nBOYD The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it. I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me... I can take care of this. \nKNOCK KNOCK \nThe five men stop breathing. Somebody's at the door. \nKNOCK KNOCK \nStunned silence. The guys stare at each other in horror. \nRALPH (O.S.) Hello? Is anyone in there? \nBoyd races to the door, eyes the peephole. \nBOYD'S POV, through the peephole, outside in the hall, a man. RALPH, early 30's, fairly unassuming. \nBOYD (calls out) What is it? \nRALPH (O.S.) Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there? \nAdam throws his head in his hands. \nBOYD (through door) What? \nRALPH (O.S.) I'm with Tina. Is she there? \nBoyd indicates to the guys to be cool. \nBOYD She's not here. \nRALPH (O.S.) Where is she? \nBOYD She's here. She's just... Hold on a second. \nBoyd turns as the guys freak. Crazed bits of panicked conversation -- GIBBERISH. \nKNOCK KNOCK. \nRALPH (O.S.) Could you open the door please. \nBoyd moves back to the door, slowly, opens it. Ralph steps in. Takes a good look around. \nTHE GUYS' POV \nAn absolute blood bath. The walls are covered with Ralph's arterial spray. Tina lies, still dead on her side. Ralph has somehow \"assumed the position\" dead, head in the bathtub. A bizarre and gruesome sight. Boyd surveys the carnage, takes charge. \nBOYD (with military precision) All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan. \nFISHER (beyond shock) I'm calling the police. \nBOYD So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them. (beat) Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat -- It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that? \nFisher's response is to join Moore, as he searches for a garbage can to puke in. Michael just stares. \nBOYD A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self- exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me? \nMICHAEL Not really. no. \nBOYD Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders \nINT. WALMART - NIGHT \nThe boys move down the isles of the massive 24 hour everything store, Boyd pushes a cart, grabbing; cleaning supplies, tarp, tape, giant pruning shears, etc... \nBOYD (V.O.) We will organize, we will mobilize, we will maximize and prioritize. \nMoore grabs a plastic garbage can off a shelf and pukes in it for all he's worth. \nINT. HARD ROCK CASINO \nThe boys attempt to look natural as they stroll through the casino with their supplies. Late night gamblers pay them little notice. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nBoyd turns up the MUSIC. \nBOYD Let's do it people. \nMUSIC OVER SERIES OF SHOTS: \nMoore and Fisher scrub blood from the carpet. Fisher keeps forgetting to breath. \nMichael and Boyd put Tina and Ralph in the bath tub. \nAdam sits in shock on the floor. \nFisher and Moore try to fix a broken chair. \nBoyd starts to dismember Ralph with the pruning shears, like cutting the joints of a roasted chicken. \nAdam stares at the wall. \nMichael wraps one of Ralph's feet in plastic, puts it in a suitcase. \nBoyd saws. Michael wraps. Fisher and Moore clean. \nAdam slowly straightens up a lamp, begins to help. \nUNTIL -- the last of the body parts, Tina's head, is wrapped in plastic, packed in a suitcase. \nThe bathroom has been remarkably cleaned up. Just a bit of blood left in the tub. Boyd looks pleased. \nBOYD All right. Looking good people. \nEXT. RED ROCK CANYON ROAD \nThe minivan bumps along a deserted road at a snail's pace. \nINT. MINIVAN \nAdam drives, cringing with every bump and bang. Everyone is tense. Boyd eyes the clock. It's 4 a.m. \nBOYD Sun rises at 5:52. \nADAM I'm not wrecking the transmission! \nEXT. DESERT \nSERIES OF SHOTS: \nThe guys off-loading the suitcases. \nFisher and Boyd digging holes. \nThey start putting the suitcases in the holes. \nMICHAEL Just go ahead and say what's on your mind. \nBOYD Speak from the heart my brother. \nAdam turns in disgust. \nADAM This is pathetic. \nMICHAEL You're pathetic. \nADAM (turning on Michael) What did you say? \nMICHAEL (pointing) You're not a team player. \nADAM Don't point at me. \nMICHAEL You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends. \nADAM I have plenty of friends. \nMICHAEL The hell you do. \nADAM The hell I don't. \nMICHAEL You have acquaintances -- business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems. \nADAM What are you fucking talking about? \nMichael looks at Boyd. \nFISHER Michael, now is probably not the best time for this. \nBOYD No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you... (points to Adam) ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker. \nDEAD SILENCE. Adam stares stupefied at Boyd, then Michael. Finally, Fisher says his prayer. \nFISHER Dear God, please forgive us for what we have done here tonight. We have lost our way. Speaking for myself, let me say... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MINIVAN - DRIVING \nFisher's prayer over the guys driving home. Each lost in his own thoughts. \nFISHER (V.O.) ...I am deeply in love with the woman I am about to marry and I look very much forward to raising a family and being a positive member of society. We promise, if you forgive us, we will never forget this tragedy and will try with all our powers to use it as a daily reminder that we are here on earth to do good not evil. Let us go from this day forward with new purpose and spirit. You have given us a second chance and let us take that second chance and use it as fuel to feed our fires of productivity so that the spirits of the two we now bury live on forever in the good deeds and positive achievements we from this moment on shall make our life's work... \nContinue as the minivan disappears down the freeway, heading back to Los Angeles. A freeway sign reads, \"Los Angeles, 358 miles.\" \nFISHER (V.O.) Thank you lord, and again, we ask for your forgiveness and guidance... Amen. \nEXT. CAR WASH - DAY \nAdam watches his mini-van move through the wash and rinse cycle, staring, paranoid at the Mexican Towel Boy cleaning the interior. \nMICHAEL tries to open a child proof bottle of Excedrin. \nBOYD plays \"Mrs. Pac-man\" in the corner. \nMEN'S ROOM \nMoore dry heaves for all he's worth. \nPAY PHONE \nFisher finishes dialing, waits... Finally... \nLIZ (V.O.) Hello. \nFISHER Hey. It's me. \nLIZ (V.O.) Where are you? \nFISHER We're on our way home. I just... we're running a little late. \nLIZ (V.O.) How late? \nFISHER No. Just like an hour or so. \nLIZ (V.O.) What about the chairs? \nFISHER Okay. \nLIZ (V.O.) What okay? \nMAGGIE Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had. \nLIZ That's our plan. \nMAGGIE Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling. \nLiz looks at Fisher. She really wants the house. He takes out his checkbook. Liz throws her arms around Fisher, kisses him. \nFISHER How much? \nMAGGIE Five percent should be fine for now, which is, let's see, twenty thousand dollars. Of course I'll be splitting my commission with your friend. (beat) He is a very sweet man. \nLiz stares at Fisher. His hand shakes as he writes the check. \nEXT. GAS STATION MINI-MART \nAdam, Lois and the kids pull into the mini-mart, up to the gas pump. \nINT. ADAM'S MINI-VAN \nAdam, ghost white, fumbles for a credit card as the kids go nuts in the back seat. \nKIDS (singing) \"Do your balls hang low, do they wobble to and fro, can you tie 'em in a knot, can you tie 'em in a bow?\" \nADAM (snapping) Knock it off! \nLOIS Don't snap at them! \nADAM They're driving me nuts! \nLOIS They're singing. \nA black sedan, looking like an unmarked police car, pulls up nose-to-nose with them at the pump. TWO MEN in dark suits in the front look like cops. Adam can't help but notice. \nADAM (getting out) It's a disgusting song. \nEXT. CAR \nAdam slides his card through at the pump and starts filling his tank as one of the \"suits\" gets out of the black sedan and does the same. \nAdam and the \"suit\" make eye-contact. \nSUIT How ya doing? \nADAM (nervous mumble) What? \nSUIT What's that? \nADAM What did you say? \nSUIT I said how's it going? \nADAM I didn't hear you. \nSUIT Well that's what I said. \nAdam nods, eyeing his gas pump, willing it to pump faster. His heart starts to pound, he looks away, sees... \nAn LAPD police car pull into the station, stops in front of the mini-mart. TWO COPS inside. \nON adam, eye-balling the cop car. He slowly turns to steal a glance at the \"suit.\" \nSUIT How do you like that mini-van? \nAdam's tank is almost filled. He wants nothing more than to get out of there... \nLois rolls down the window. \nLOIS Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts. \nADAM What? \nLOIS They're screaming for Starbursts. \nADAM Later. \nLOIS They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts. \nAdam looks from the suit to the cop car... \nADAM Fine. \nTRACK with Adam as he walks from the pumping across the parking lot, past the cop car, his HEART POUNDING... \nADAM (dazed) Where's the bathroom? \nINT. REHEARSAL DINNER - NIGHT \nA large dining room in a Westside restaurant has been taken over by the wedding party. Seventy-five guests, dressed up, are into the desserts. The toasts are about halfway over. \nMR. FISHER stands in the middle of the room with the large blown-up pictures of Keith at different stages of his life. \nMR. FISHER (holding picture of Keith, age 4, on a mule) And this is Keith at age four and his best friend \"Bunker the Mule.\" Evidently, when they were in camp, Keith and Boyd got into some serious arguments over exactly who was Keith's best friend -- Boyd or the mule. \nMr. Fisher holds up a photo of a young Fisher and young Boyd, both scrappy and bloodied from a fist fight. \nBoyd sits with Moore at a table. \nBOYD Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey. \nFISHER (seated next to Liz) You always were a jealous man. \nMr. Fisher holds up a picture of Keith, Boyd, Moore and Michael all in a Peewee Football uniforms. \nMR. FISHER After camp came football, and for those of you not following the sports pages back in 1977, you might not remember the Peewee Powerhouse Oklahoma, who, under the brilliant leadership of your's truly, rolled to an auspicious league record of 0- 12 scoring exactly zero touchdowns. \nTIGHT ON Adam, looking extremely uncomfortable, surrounded by his family. \nMICHAEL The problem was coaching. Poor leadership. \nAs the room LAUGHS, Adam becomes visibly upset. Not keeping it together. \nBOYD The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left... \nFISHER No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking... \nAs the guys debate, in front of the room, who's fault Oklahoma's 0-12 season really was. \nTIGHT ON Adam. He's had enough, excuses himself from the table. \nTIGHT ON Fisher, seeing Adam, he quietly excuses himself. \nEXT. BEACH RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nAdam stands by his car trying to compose himself. Fisher approaches. \nFISHER You all right? \nADAM I can't fucking breathe. I'm sorry. \nBoyd, followed by Michael exits the restaurant. \nBOYD (approaching) OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here. \nFISHER Shut up Boyd. \nBOYD Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior. \nFISHER He's having a problem here. \nMICHAEL What's the problem Adam? \nMoore joins the group. \nMOORE What's the problem? \nAll eyes on Adam, who's eyes are starting to tear up. \nBOYD What is your problem? \nADAM I can't do this. \nPAUSE. \nMOORE Can't do what? \nADAM We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car. \nBOYD What? \nADAM At the seven-eleven. \nBOYD Who? What are you talking about? \nADAM They're on me. They're smoking me out! \nBOYD (shouts) Nobody's smoking anybody out. \nMOORE Shut up Michael. \nMICHAEL (screams) I KILLED MY BROTHER! \nAll eyes on Michael. Boyd is immediately up trying to get Michael out of the booth. Casually, sweetly... \nBOYD Okay. Time to fly. \nFisher helps Boyd lift Michael, who is becoming more and more frenzied. \nMICHAEL I ran down my brother in cold blood. Shame on me! Shame! Shame! Shame! \nWAITRESSES, COOKS and LATE NIGHT DINNERS stare, confused as the HOWLING Michael is carried to the door. \nMICHAEL (struggling) Time to pay the man. \"For if we confess our sins he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" \nFisher and Boyd struggle with Michael. \nFISHER (tipping Waitress) Thank you. \nShe watches them haul Michael outside. \nPOV WAITRESS \nMichael thrashes wildly in the parking lot. \nEXT PARKING LOT \nMICHAEL \"Kill one man and you are a murderer! Kill millions and you are a conqueror -- Kill all and you are a God!\" \nMichael breaks free, starts running away. Boyd, Moore and Fisher give chase. Moore dives on Michael's back. Fisher helps Moore hold Michael down while Boyd gets the car. \nMICHAEL (calming down) \"The memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot.\" \nBoyd is there with the car. They load Michael into the back seat, climb in and disappear into the night. \nINT. CAR - DRIVING \nBoyd drives, Fisher rides shotgun, Moore's in the back trying to contain Michael. \nBOYD You will get yourself together here mister. Are you hearing me? \nMichael, now catatonic, stares out the window. \nFISHER He's cracked up. \nBOYD He is not cracking up. \nFISHER Boyd... What have we done? \nBOYD What did you ask me? \nFISHER What? \nBOYD What is the question you asked me? \nFISHER I said, what have we done? \nBOYD Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done? \nFISHER I don't know! I just want to get married. \nBOYD Say it again. \nFISHER What? \nBOYD What you just said. Say it again. \nFISHER I just want to get married. \nBOYD Exactly! Exactly my point. \nMOORE What's your fucking point? \nBOYD I'm not talking to you? \nFISHER What's your point? \nBOYD You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Michael. This car is full of love, and nothing -- absolutely nothing -- supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes. \nBoyd takes Fisher's head in his hands and kisses him deeply on the mouth. \nBOYD Love does not lose. \nMICHAEL Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull. \nFISHER I don't hear it. \nMICHAEL Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem. \nFISHER Have another drink. \nINT. ADAM AND LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nTRACKING SHOT down hallway into bedroom where Lois sleeps peacefully. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nFisher and Michael. Moore, drinking, just listening. \nMICHAEL Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... \"Get ready\"... \"watch for it\"... \"here it comes,\" here comes the \"wahoo\" \nFISHER The wahoo? \nMICHAEL The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter... and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for... You get me? \nFISHER The wahoo moment? \nMICHAEL That's my point! You see Man... burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me? \nFISHER I think so. \nMICHAEL I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it? (finishes drink) You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things. \nINT. LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nLois' bedroom. As Lois sleeps, Boyd softly enters the room. Moving in on the sleeping Lois, another couple of steps, he looms over her, reaches his hand to her throat when, suddenly, Lois' eyes snap open. Boyd is startled. Lois grabs mace from her night stand and sprays Boyd in the face. He MOANS, stumbles back. Lois leaps on him like a shark slamming a side of beef. \nThey go down hard on the floor and start fighting like wild animals. \nLOIS You picked the wrong woman mother- fucker! \nAs Lois sinks her teeth into Boyd's balls. \nBACK AT THE BAR \nMICHAEL You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect. \nMOORE I don't think that's a good idea. \nMICHAEL I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here? \nFISHER I appreciate it. I do, but... maybe you ought to just ease up on yourself a bit. \nMICHAEL No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois. \nLOIS' BEDROOM \nBoyd and Lois are choking the living shit out of each other. Boyd pulls back, swings with a left, Lois ducks, she swings, a right cross to Boyds eye. He goes down. She jumps on him. Choking him like a mad dog. As Boyd struggles for air... \nTHE BAR \nFisher checks his watch as Michael fumbles with his eighth shot of Yukon Jack. \nMICHAEL If I was to think... If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over... I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just... Well I just... \nFISHER What is it? \nMICHAEL (drunk-slow) Well if you do think about names... Michael's a pretty good one... It's done me all right. \nMichael's eyes bore into Fisher, like he knows something Fisher doesn't. Fisher's cell phone RINGS. \nFISHER (answers) Yeah. \nINT. LOIS' BEDROOM \nTIGHT ON Boyd, eye swelling, scratch marks, hair a crazy mess. \nBOYD (into the phone) Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation. \nINTERCUT BOYD AND FISHER \nFISHER What does that mean? \nMichael stares at Fisher. \nBOYD I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is... you still got Michael there? \nFISHER What are you talking about? \nBARRY MORRIS I'm talking about Life insurance. I'm talking about money. \nLIZ Money? \nBARRY MORRIS Yes money. Adam had a five hundred thousand dollar Term Life Insurance Policy. \nPAUSE. \nLIZ What does that mean? \nFISHER That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids. \nLIZ (amazed) No. \nFISHER Yes. \nBARRY MORRIS Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam... and failed to make his last payment... so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void. (off Liz's horror) Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand. \nLIZ (relieved) Well, oh... \nBARRY MORRIS And a house. Valued at 350 thousand. \nLIZ So where's that leave us? \nFISHER 150 plus 350... we still get 500 thousand. \nBARRY MORRIS (beat) No. Not even close. With property values down, the house is worth 100,000 less than 450 he paid for it. With three credit cards, the minivan payments, and other outstanding debts... Plus the Income and Estate Taxes assessed on his IRA... (punches his calculator) You'll get, oh... in the neighborhood of, ah... 14,223 dollars. \nAdam Jr. suddenly slips off his chair, lands flat on his back, starts struggling to get up. Fisher tries to help Little Adam up. \nLITTLE ADAM Get away from me! \nFISHER I'm just trying to help... \nLITTLE ADAM I don't want your help! \nFISHER Stop kicking. Stop kicking! \nFisher manages to get Adam Jr. back up in his chair. Liz looks rather horrified. \nBARRY MORRIS (breaking the tension) So. When is the wedding. \nLIZ Tomorrow (at Fisher) We are getting married tomorrow. \nINT. CAR \nFisher drives, Liz up front, Adam jr. and Timmy in the back. Everyone is shocked in silence. Fisher looks deathly ill, like he's about to vomit. He pulls the car over and gets out. \nEXT. FISHER'S CAR \nFisher leans on the trunk, puking. Liz gets out to help him, he starts crying. Liz is gentle and loving. \nLIZ It's okay... It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama. \nFISHER No it's not okay. It's not. \nThe kids watch from the rear view window but can't hear. \nLIZ Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay. \nFISHER (sobbing) Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off. \nLIZ (ice) Don't even. \nFISHER Do you love me? \nLIZ What? \nFISHER Do you love me? \nLIZ What kind of stupid question is that? \nFISHER (breaking down) Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We... \nLIZ What are you talking about? \nFISHER (completely hysterical) Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Michael crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident. \nLIZ Who's dead? \nFISHER The prostitute. \nFISHER What money? \nBOYD Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive. \nFISHER You're sick. \nBOYD (veins pulsing) And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money! \nFISHER Not a prayer. \nBOYD I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark! \nFISHER You need help. \nFisher turns away. BOYD combusts. He leaps on Fisher with a wild cry. \nBOYD I want that money! \nBoyd and fisher fight like animals; choking, pounding, mauling, a fight to the death. Fisher is losing, Boyd is choking the life out of him, killing him. Fisher is going down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until... \nCRASH. Boyd's head is caved in from behind. REVEAL Liz wielding a big, heavy crucifix. Boyd slumps to the ground. Fisher gasps for air. Boyd stirs. Liz beats him repeatedly with the crucifix until he's dead as a door knob. Fisher is stunned. Liz tosses the cross. Miraculously, only one perfect droplet of blood has gotten on her wedding dress. She flicks it off with her finger. \nLIZ (composing herself) Here comes the bride. \nLiz gathers up her train and marches out. Fisher looks at Boyd, a bloody dead mess. \nTHE WEDDING \nFisher joins Moore at the alter. JUDGE TOWER smiles warmly at Fisher. \nMOORE Where's Boyd? \nFISHER (whispers) Downstairs in the closet. \nBefore Moore can ask, the ORGAN begins playing the WEDDING MARCH. Liz starts down the aisle, escorted by her father, She smiles radiantly. \nLiz's father kisses her and gives her to Fisher. They stand before the Judge who starts talking. TIGHT ON Fisher. His head pounding. He hears none of what the Judge says until... \nJUDGE TOWER May we have the rings please? \nFISHER What? \nJUDGE TOWER The rings? \nFisher looks at Moore. \nINT. CHURCH BASEMENT \nMoore opens the closet. Boyd falls out. \nINT. CHURCH \nEveryone waits patiently. Fisher is sweating. He looks at Liz who stares straight ahead. \nINT. CHURCH BASEMENT \nMoore rolls Boyd over, checks every pocket, trying not to get blood on himself. \nINT. CHURCH \nMoore returns. \nMOORE Got 'em. \nHe hands the rings to the Judge, at which time, he, she, Fisher and Liz all see blood on his white shirt cuff. The Judge looks at Moore. He pulls his jacket sleeve down. \nJUDGE TOWER (continues) These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part? \nFISHER I do. \nLiz slides the ring on Fisher's finger. \nJUDGE TOWER Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part? \nLIZ I do. \nFisher slides the ring on Liz's finger. \nJUDGE TOWER I now pronounce you husband and wife. \nFisher kisses Liz. They turn to face their guests who applaud. Liz cries tears of joy. \nWEDDING RECEPTION - TENT NEXT TO CHURCH \nFISHER I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot -- \"Pup Corn.\" \nMOORE Pup corn? \nFISHER That's right, \"Pup Corn.\" Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all out money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of \"Pup Corn\" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes \"Shelmer,\" our 8 year old mutt. \"Here Shelmer,\" my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, \"Here girl.\" This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the \"Pup Corn.\" Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, \"Pup Corn\" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never. \nSILENCE hangs again. \nEXT. DESERT - LATER \nFisher and Moore search for the graves of Tina and Ralph with flashlights and shovels. \nFISHER I think it was over here. \nThey move into a new area and start poking around. Nothing. \nMOORE It was over by those rocks. \nAgain they search, prodding into earth with their shovels. Nothing. \nFisher stops digging, tired, he pauses, shines his light around until... \nFISHER There. \nMOORE Where? \nFisher moves to a new spot. \nFISHER There. This rock is where I stood when I said the prayer. \nHe starts digging in front of the rock. The earth is soft. \nFISHER Bingo. \nMoore and Fisher quickly start to dig, until, finally, Moore's shovel makes contact. \nMOORE Got it. \nAnd they dig some more. \nDISSOLVE: \nMOORE \nin the hole, passing the suitcases up to Fisher. \nDISSOLVE: \nFISHER \nloads the cases into the car. \nEXT. NEW BURIAL SITE \nThe suitcases are unloaded. Fisher and Moore dig a new grave. Moore's back is to Fisher as he digs. \nMOORE I've been thinking about what you said that day. The prayer. About using this whole mess to bring out the good in me... \nFisher is directly above Moore, holding the shovel, looking down at the back of Moore's head. \nFISHER Yeah? \nMOORE I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing. \nFISHER (slowly raises the shovel over his head) That's a good one. \nMOORE I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think? \nMoore looks up to... \nFISHER, tears running down his face, the shovel high above his head, ready to bring it down hard onto Moore's skull. \nMOORE confused and then realization... CUT between Fisher above, poised to strike, Moore below, still and vulnerable. Their eyes locked for several beats. Finally... \nMOORE What do you think? \nSlowly, Fisher lowers his shovel. \nFISHER I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother. \nMOORE (back to work) That's what I'm thinking. \nDISSOLVE: \n", "test1_input": "LOIS Feeling a little HUNGOVER are we? Do you kids take note? (taking pictures) See how pathetic Daddy and his jackass friends look?! \nFisher makes eye contact with Liz. \nLIZ What's the word on the chairs? \nFISHER I'm working on it. \nLIZ Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge. \nINT. JUDGE'S OFFICE \nON JUDGE LAUREL TOWER. \nJUDGE TOWER We don't say \"love, honor and obey\" anymore. And we don't say \"till death do us part.\" Today we say, \"respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love.\" How does that sound? \nLIZ I kind of like \"till death do us part.\" I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think? \nLiz looks at Fisher who is a nuclear wreck, barely coherent. \nFISHER Yea... It's great... seems like... I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there. \nJUDGE TOWER All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words -- singing or anything? \nFISHER (beat) Are we supposed to? \nJUDGE TOWER It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't. \nLIZ We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out. \nJUDGE TOWER Okay great. What will that be? \nLIZ We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic. \nJUDGE TOWER What song? \nLIZ \"You Send Me.\" \nJUDGE TOWER Oh I know that. How does it go... \nLIZ You know, (talks it) Darling you... you send me... Darling you... You mend me. (to Fisher) Honey, sing it for Judge Tower. \nIn lieu of an anxiety attack, Fisher... \nFISHER (sings) \"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me. \nLIZ \"At first I thought it was infatuation... But oh it's lasted so long...\" \nFISHER & LIZ \"Now I find myself wanting to marry you, marry you and take you home...\" \nJudge Tower joins in and the three squeak out the chorus and it's pretty pathetic. \nMUSIC OVER: \nINT. TUXEDO RENTAL STORE \nThe guys are being fitted for their wedding tuxes. \nLois takes pictures of the five groomsmen. \nLiz closely watches as the TAILOR makes adjustments to Fisher's tux. \nAdam looks sick. \nEXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - SUNSET \nFisher and his dad walk along the pier eating hot dogs. A father and son moment. \nMR. FISHER I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing. (starts to choke-up) I'm just so goddamn proud of you... God knows I didn't always play it right with you... \nFISHER You did all right dad. \nMR. FISHER I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am. \nFISHER You never walked away dad. You could have walked away. \nMR. FISHER I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, \"My son just arrived the other day... he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me... My boy is just like me.\" Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me. \nFISHER Harry Chaplin. \"Cats in the Cradle.\" \nMR.

I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head. \nADAM (freaks) Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure! \nBOYD Lighten up Adam. Show some character. \nADAM Don't talk to me about character. \nBOYD Watch the tone fella. \nFisher realizes he's not breathing. \nADAM Fuck you Boyd! \nBOYD Any time fat boy! \nBoyd hangs up the phone, looks at his picture on the realty sign he just pounded into someone's yard. Behind the bizarre sincere smile we now see the eyes of a maniac. Boyd picks up the sledge hammer and swings wildly, destroying his sign, splintering it into kindling. \nINT.

Lois is sobbing when... ALARMS GO OFF IN ADAM'S ROOM. \nA MEDICAL TEAM rushes into the room. Adam is a v-tach -- Heart's not beating. The team injects medicine, defribulates. Lois watches in horror as her husband dies in front of her... Finally a DOCTOR calls time of death. \nLois collapses on the floor. \nWAITING ROOM \nThe guys have witnessed Adam's death. Michael turns in horror. Boyd, Fisher and Moore stare. Liz rushes to Fisher, throws her arms around him, overcome with grief. \nINT. DENNY'S - LATE NIGHT \nFisher, Boyd, Moore and Michael eat eggs. \nBOYD The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know? \nMICHAEL Ball park sausages. \nBOYD You want some breakfast meat, Michael. Is that what you want? \nMICHAEL (clearly starting to crack) Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for \"The Immaculate Reception,\" his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America. (inappropriately loud) Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime. \nBOYD Easy Michael. \nMICHAEL (on a roll) He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out. \nCUSTOMERS are starting to pay notice. \n", "test2_id": 1150, "test3_input": "MICHAEL (screaming) Goosed! \nBOYD Stop it! \nMICHAEL Goosed! \nPeople are staring. \nBOYD Stop. \nMICHAEL Goosed! \nBOYD (to Moore) Give me the Valium. \nMOORE He just had two. \nBOYD Give me two more. \nMoore counts out two Valium, hands them to Boyd as michael continues to freak. \nBOYD (to Michael) Open sesame. \nMichael complies like a puppy. \nFISHER Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him. \nBOYD Suck my ass. \nINT. LOIS' KITCHEN \nTIGHT ON Lois, busted nose, eyes black. \nLOIS I never liked you Boyd. You're a snaky little fuck. Always have been. \nWIDE ON the guys, seated around a little breakfast table. Michael's in a Valium stupor. \nBOYD What are you talking about? \nLOIS Don't sweet lip me. \nBOYD I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from... \nLOIS You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas. \nBOYD Nothing happened in Vegas. \nLOIS I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas? \nFISHER (beat) Nothing happened in Vegas. \nLOIS (not buying it) Moore? \nMOORE (sheepish) Nothing happened. \nMichael starts back in with the power sobbing. All eyes are on him. Guilty, uncomfortable silence. Michael's coming unglued. \nLOIS Michael? Do you have something to tell me? \nBOYD Michael. Tell Lois that nothing... \nLOIS Shut up Boyd! Michael? \nAll eyes on Michael. \nMICHAEL (quiet) Goosed. \nFisher struggles to breathe. Boyd tenses up. \nLOIS What? \nMICHAEL Lois we were bad, we were very, very bad. \nBOYD He's upset about Adam. We're all upset. \nLOIS I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers. \nBOYD Lois please. \nShe heads for the phone. \nLOIS Fuck you Boyd. \nThe guys are freaking as she picks up the phone. Boyd looks at the kitchen knives. Fisher sees him, intervenes quickly... \n", "test3_true": "Lois freezes, puts down the phone. Boyd and Moore look stunned at Fisher -- good lie. \nLOIS What? \nFISHER I'm sorry he was unfaithful to you. \nBOYD And it wasn't the first time... He had a thing about prostitutes. \nFisher gives Boyd a look. Lois starts to choke up. \nLOIS (crushed) My Adam? \nLois crumbles before their eyes. \nBOYD We're sorry. \nLois starts sobbing. Michael joins in. Adam Jr. and Timmy appear in the door, in their pajamas, awakened by the noise. Seeing their mother in tears, they start to sob. The room is filled with anguished tears. Boyd give Lois a glass of water and a Valium. \nEXT. LOIS' HOUSE \nFisher and Moore load Michael into the car. Boyd leans into the back window. Adam Jr. and Timmy are in the backseat, still in their P.J.'s. \nBOYD Mommy just needs a little time out. Everything's gonna be okay. Okay? (the boys don't answer) Okay. \nFisher starts to get in the car, Boyd pulls him aside, very wound up. \nBOYD After you drop the kids off, take Michael home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep. \nFISHER I don't think that's such a good idea. \nBOYD Just do it. \nFISHER What are you going to do? \nBOYD Take care of business. \nFISHER (accusing) What does that mean? \nBOYD And what does that mean? (off no response) Are you insane?! (whispers) You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you? \nFISHER I don't know... \nBOYD You got a nasty side to your thought process. \nTIME CUT TO: \nINT. FISHER AND LIZ'S HOUSE \nTIGHT ON Fisher. \nFISHER I'm sorry. Honey... it's just for tonight. \nLiz is in her robe, none too pleased. Adam Jr. and Timmy sit in the b.g. at the kitchen table eating cookies and milk. \nFISHER Lois is a mess and Michael's really upset. Everyone's upset. \nLIZ We're not canceling. \nFISHER I know. \nLIZ I won't even discuss it. \nFISHER No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Michael home. I'll be right back. \nLIZ I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow. \nFISHER Don't we already have someone to do that for us? \nLIZ Yeah. You. \nFISHER Okay. Okay. \nFisher kisses Liz and goes. \nINT. BAR \nDark, smoky, MUSIC. Michael, Fisher and Moore sit in a corner booth. \nMICHAEL (finger in his ear) Do you hear buzzing fish? \nFISHER Buzzing? \n", "test3_id": 1151}

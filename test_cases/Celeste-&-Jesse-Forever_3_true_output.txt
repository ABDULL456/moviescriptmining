BETH (in pain) AHHHHHHHHHH! 
A security guard heads for them. 
CELESTE Sorry sir, my friend has a really strong emotional reaction to modern art. 
BETH That was fucking rude. 
CELESTE Had to be done. 
15 EXT. JESSE'S STUDIO-EARLY EVENING 15 
The studio is beautifully, magically chaotic. There are large canvasses everywhere, paint rags, spray cans, common household items turned into sculptures (buttons, clothespin, hangers) and mobiles. Celeste walks in. Jesse is on a mattress on the floor, he's clearly been sitting there for a while. He is fist-deep in a huge bag of Cheetos and he's watching the 2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo. He is watching a short feature about Olympian Matthias Steiner, a gold medalist in weight lifting. 
CELESTE Hey...you're not working? Are you watching the Olympics? Again? And crying? Again? 
Jesse blows his nose. 
JESSE Yeah. 
CELESTE God, you really love that, don't you? 
JESSE Matthias' wife died in a car accident last year. 
CELESTE Well, three years ago now but... 
JESSE And he dedicated his gold medal to her. The human spirit is...unbreakable. 
Jesse is choked up, can barely speak. 
CELESTE Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that artwork for the Pop Form website? 
JESSE Huh? Oh yeah, I'm almost done. I'm working on it. I think you'll really like it. 
CELESTE I'll like it more when I have it because I needed it yesterday, so... 
Jesse turns off the television, takes a deep breath, wipes his eyes and recovers. 
JESSE Celeste, can you sit down for a minute? I have something really important to tell you. 
CELESTE Oh. Okay. Does it have something to do with the work you owe me? 
Celeste sits. Jesse sits next to her. Again, he has tears in his eyes. 
JESSE I don't know how to tell you this but...I have a date tonight. I'm gonna start dating. People. 
CELESTE A date? Really? That is so great. 
JESSE It is? You don't... 
CELESTE Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you, Jess. 
JESSE That doesn't bother you? Wow, okay. Well, it's actually the Yogurt Girl. From Yoga Yurt? 
CELESTE Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's cute! But so young, right? 
JESSE Super young. Her body is all-time. 
CELESTE Okay, no need for that. But this is good! You gotta crawl before you walk. I mean she's definitely not gonna be wifey number two, right? Ha. 
JESSE Well, it's just a date. 
She hugs him in an unconsciously patronizing way. 
CELESTE Big move. I'm proud of you. 
Jesse looks confused and slightly hurt. 
JESSE Thanks? 
CELESTE Can I get up now? 
JESSE Huh? Yeah, sure. 
Celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair. 
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it and from the get go, she was way into...what are you looking at? 
CELESTE No, nothing. Are you gonna wear your hair like that?

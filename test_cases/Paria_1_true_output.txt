Alike shoves her sister and tries to close the door. Sharonda yanks the door open wider. 
SHARONDA (whispering) Don't push me. 
ALIKE (whispering) Go to bed. 
SHARONDA I know what stays open past midnight. 
Sharonda puts a hand to her head and does a little dance. 
ALIKE Shut up! 
Alike eases Sharonda's door shut.     Sharonda swings the door open wide. 
SHARONDA Good night Lee! 
Sharonda slams her door.      The light clicks on underneath Alike's parent's door. 
AUDREY (O.S.) Lee? Lee?! 
Alike rolls her eyes at her sister's closed door and shrugs into her room. 
10   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     10 
Alike rushes to shove her stuffed backpack under the bed. She tosses her shoes in the closet just as her mother, AUDREY appears in the doorway. 
AUDREY Nice to know you still live here. 
Alike peels off her socks and slumps on the bed. 
AUDREY (CONT'D) What're you doing home so late, anyway? 
ALIKE Lost track of time. 
AUDREY You know what time your curfew is. Where were you? 
ALIKE Movies. 
AUDREY The show ended at midnight. And your curfew is twelve thirty. 
ALIKE I lost track of time. 
Audrey gets cozy in the doorjamb.      Alike turns her back on her and slumps into pajamas. 
AUDREY At least you were cute. Where'd you get that shirt? `Princess'. I like that. 
Alike winds the princess shirt around her fist and launches to the top of the closet. 
ALIKE It's old. 
AUDREY Compliments your figure. I saw something just like it on sale, maybe we could go shopping-- 
ALIKE Goodnight. 
Audrey stiffens and pulls her robe tighter. Vinegar replaces honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice. 
AUDREY I really don't care for that young lady you run around with anyway. 
ALIKE Yeah, okay! 
AUDREY And tie your head up. 
Alike snags a satin headscarf from the nightstand and slaps it around her head. 
AUDREY(CONT'D) It's your head. And you really should wash your face, too. 
ALIKE I don't have on make-up. 
AUDREY Wash your face anyway. 
ALIKE Mom. I'm seventeen years old, please don't talk to me like-- 
AUDREY Watch your tone. (Beat) Well, it's your skin.

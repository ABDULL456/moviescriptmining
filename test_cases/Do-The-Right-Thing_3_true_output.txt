ML A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time. 
CLOSE--SWEET DICK WILLIE 
SWEET DICK WILLIE It has been a long time. 
CLOSE--COCONUT SID 
COCONUT SID How long? 
CLOSE--ML 
ML Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb. 
This is truly a stupefying question and all three are silent. What is the answer? 
COCONUT SID It's gotta be cuz we're Black.  No other explanation, nobody don't want the Black man to be about shit. 
SWEET DICK WILLIE Old excuse. 
ML I'll be one happy fool to see us have our own business right here. Yes, sir.  I'd be the first in line to spend the little money I got. 
Sweet Dick Willie gets up from his folding chair. 
SWEET DICK WILLIE It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business. 
ML It's a motherfucking shame. 
COCONUT SID Ain't that a bitch.

CEE He's self-appointed. 
ELLA Leave him alone.

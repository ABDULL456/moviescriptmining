MIKE (amazed) Yeah, what a woman. 
He marks it in his CROSSWORDS:  she moves closer,leaning over his shoulder to see. 
CLAIRE Didn't do very well, did you? 
MIKE (a laugh) Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things. 
CLAIRE You were reading my Renoir. 
MIKE How did you know? 
CLAIRE You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir? 
MIKE (thoughtful) They're kind of fuzzy. 
CLAIRE You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind. 
MIKE No kidding. 
In the SILENCE that follows, their eyes on each other, appraising. 
CLAIRE So, this could be your last night, huh? 
MIKE Could be, I guess. 
CLAIRE (a thought) Want to go out for a drink? (re: his surprised expression) I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail... 
MIKE (a beat) Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT 
CLAIRE and MIKE walking; her arm looped in his -- the BLACK-AND-WHITE keeping pace alongside them -- their conversation animated, clearly enjoying one another's company. 
CLAIRE (laughing) You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way? 
MIKE Absolutely.  Look at this. 
He demonstrates a peculiar walk; arms and legs moving in ridiculous awkwardness. 
CLAIRE That's the dumbest walk I ever saw! 
MIKE (indignant) No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out. 
CLAIRE And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid! 
MIKE (mock anger) Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business. 
CLAIRE Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me. 
She takes off down the street; walking stupidly, worse than he did -- he's LAUGHING as he WATCHES HER GO. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PATROL CAR - NIGHT 
The COPS following exchange dubious glances, getting a glimpse of the strangeness. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  PIANO BAR - NIGHT 
CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE and MIKE, at a small table, in darkness, a piano bar playing in the background.  The song being sung is "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME." 
MIKE ... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act... 
CLAIRE So it was "love". 
MIKE Yeah.  It was. 
CLAIRE And "is"...? 
He hesitates; but nods. 
MIKE (confirming it) Yeah. 
CLAIRE That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...? 
MIKE No dog. 
CLAIRE I saw you with a dog, in my mind.

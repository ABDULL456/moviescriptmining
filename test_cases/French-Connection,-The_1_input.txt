MULDERIG Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent. 
DOYLE 
DOYLE The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake. 
Close shot of CHARNIER strolling past the telephone booth, DOYLE looking down. 
DOYLE I don't care how many bartenders are sick.  I don't work in that joint.  What the hell kind of a union are you running down there?

INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR 
Close view of subway doors hissing shut and an umbrella being raised at the last moment by an off-camera hand (CHARNIER's).  The doors jerk open in the safety spasm. There is a blur of the a fabric moving across the camera, blocking the view of the doors.  It is only a moment.  When it clears, the doors are closed again, the umbrella is gone. But we don't know what happened and the train isn't moving.

INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR 
Quick, shocked close view of that car, revealing that CHARNIER isn't there among the twenty passengers dozing or moping in their seats.  There is a blurred flash as if DOYLE's own eyes are spinning frantically back to the windows of his own car.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

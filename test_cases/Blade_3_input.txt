EXT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DUSK 
CLOSE ON Karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows, watching the sun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - DUSK 
Windy. Urban desolation. Blade stands on the perimeter of a sprawling cardboard and plywood squatter's ghetto which has sprung up around the city dump. CHILDREN and DOGS forage for salvageable items, while in the distance, dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse. 
MOMENTS LATER, 
Blade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and ashcan fires. A CROWD quickly closes in around him, suspicious. A BRUTISH MAN steps forward, challenging him -- 
MAN Extranjero. Â¿Quien es? 
BLADE I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me. 
The man turns to his fellow squatters, WHISPERING. After a heated debate, a GAUNT WOMAN steps forward, motioning -- 
WOMAN This way.

INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT 
Whistler and Karen sit at a work table. Karen is looking at a blood smear slide through a microscope. 
KAREN All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood? 
WHISTLER Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin. 
KAREN Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia? 
Whistler nods. 
KAREN So what about gene therapy? 
Whistler looks intrigued. Karen continues. 
KAREN Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin. 
WHISTLER How? 
KAREN With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia. 
Whistler can hardly believe what he's hearing. 
WHISTLER You're serious? You actually think this could work? 
Karen pauses -- we can see in her expression that there's something she's been holding back. 
KAREN On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure -- (gravely) The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him. 
WHISTLER Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins. 
At that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out. Karen looks around the room, alarmed. 
KAREN What happened to the power? 
WHISTLER (concerned) I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in. 
A few seconds pass. The back-up generator still hasn't activated. Whistler moves to the window -- 
WHISTLER UV floodlights are down too. 
As Whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of GLASS SHATTERING coming from the other end of the workshop. Whistler shines the flashlight in that direction. We hear more sounds now -- water draining, glass tinkling. 
Whistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. He edges towards the black-out curtains, Karen falling in behind him. 
INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - TANK ROOM - NIGHT 
Whistler and Karen enter, cautious -- 
THE TANK 
containing the vampire child has been smashed open. It's empty now, with just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a widening pool -- and a trail of tiny BLOODY FOOTPRINTS leading back out into the main workshop.

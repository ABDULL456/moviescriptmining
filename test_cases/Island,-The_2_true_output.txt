Scheer peels off his headset, giving full leash to his senses, straining to concentrate. Seconds of pent silence. Then he hears a faint humming. His gaze slowly drifts up to a ventilator grid. 
76   INT . / EXT . THE FUNNEL - NIGHT 
A POV LOOKING UP. The funnel mouth framing a vista of the world outside. A hostile vista of black sky, maelstroms of sand. The sound of blasting air, suborned to the giant howl of a DUSTSTORM. A HAND. Reaching over the funnel lip as Lincoln pulls himself up with a mighty effort. Blinking, blinded by the sand, he swings astride the lip. Then he reaches down to pull Ester up. Ester gains the lip and likewise swings astride, coughing, blinking. T H E DUSTY EARTH as Lincoln leaps down to meet it. We track up as he helps Ester down from the funnel. Her feet meeting the earth, we are now in CU o n their faces. Gaping and blinking at the prospect of the world outside. A world of darkness and storm. 
SUDDEN BLINDING LIGHT as halogens explode the darkness. Lincoln shields his eyes, scanning for their source. He spots a large cubic building, banks of spotlights on the roof. He pulls Ester away. Away from the lights and towards the safety of darkness. 
77   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT 
T H E THRUM OF EXTRACTOR FANS. Scheer pacing on a catwalk. White uniforms above and below, flashlights roving, sliced by the blades of the extractor fans. From somewhere, comes a shout- 
C E N S O R (O.S.) Sir ! We got em! Motion sensors just picked them up at the surface! 
78   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT 
ANOTHER BURST OF HALOGENS. More spotlights engage, their blaze flooding across the foreview, catching two figures; Lincoln and Ester, running, now, veering sharply away from the light. Now disappearing from sight, dropping into the trench of the lodeway. 
79   INT . MAINTENANCE ELEVATOR - CONTAINMENT 
THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES. The elevator crammed with censors. Scheer at the front, staring ahead. He looks very focused, bitterly so. The look of a man outwitted by lab rats. 
80   EXT. THE LODEWAY - NIGHT 
THE DARKNESS OF THE TRENCH. Lincoln and Ester running along the lode-way, stumbling over the buffers. Above them, the dust flails in lashing tongues, starkly depicted by the halogens. 
81   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT 
WHITE UNIFORMS IN THE NIGHT - censors spill forth into the halogen light, splitting in all directions. Scheer suddenly notices the corona of light from the front of the complex. He barks something inaudible to his men, launching into a run. 
82   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT THE GATEWAY LOOMING ABOVE. Beneath, Lincoln and Ester, on their knees, clawing at the dust. Like burrowing animals, trying to widen the gap between the foot of the gate and the lodeway. 
83   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT A LONE WHITE UNIFORM. As Scheer reaches the forecourt, stopping to scan the spotlit view, the veils of the duststorm. His face tightening with urgency. Suddenly he taps his headset, barking- 
S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET) The lodeway! Flood it! Light it up! 
84   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT 
THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES barely audible over the storm. Lincoln and Ester, washed by pulsing red light. Ester recoiling, her arm flinging back from the pull. Lincoln grabbing her, his own arm straining now. The polarity tugging their ethercuffs. 
85   EXT . THE LODEWAY - NIGHT 
THE RED WASH OF LIGHT from the lodeway as Scheer races up the edge, eyes trawling the trench for his quarry. His pace now suddenly dropping, slowing to a halt. He doubles over, catching his breath. More white uniforms now appear from the dust as the Censors, unable to match his pace, finally catch up. The first reaching him, Scheer pulls upright, bellowing over the wind- 
SCHEER G e t me a bird! 
CENSOR A bird?! In this storm?! 
SCHEER The y got out! They got past the gate! 
Scheer spins on his heel back towards The Institute. The Censor lingers, confused. Then he fixes on the lodeway. Floating past in the red wash are the luminous blue seams of two ethercuffs. 
86   EXT . THE DESERT - NIGHT 
The perimeter wall silhouetted in the middle-distance. Lincoln and Ester scramble through the scrub, blinded by dust, driven by momentum. As Ester starts lagging behind, Lincoln grabs her arm- 
LINCOLN Ester ! We have to keep going! 
But Ester resists him, breaking loose from his grasp. Lincoln looks at her, uncomprehending. Until he sees her expression, the harrowed stare in her eyes, the labored heaving of her chest. 
LINCOLN Ester? 
Ester staggers back, losing balance, reeling as if spun by the storm. Her eyes widening, senses flooding. The howling wind, the swirling dustclouds, the pendent gulf of black sky. Her reel returning her to face Lincoln, Ester opens her mouth to speak. But all that comes is A SCREAM. A scream from deep within, shrill and hysterical, the only articulation she can find. Lincoln grabs her and covers her mouth. Fighting to stifle her, rocking to her convulsions. But Ester keeps screaming. A scream of everything. 
87   INT . BEDROOM - SOMEWHERE - LATE NIGHT 
All is still. Just a muted shudder of wind on glass. The room is in shadow. All we see is a canopied bed where a figure, obscured, lies sleeping. The still is disrupted by a chime. The figure stirs, fumbling at the nightstand. A holoframe resolves, the light revealing Dr. Sanger, rumpled by sleep. He peers into the holoframe to find the face of Merrick, gaunt with concern- 
Merrick (ON HOLOFRAME) He n r y . . . There's been a breach. 
H A R D CUT TO BLACK. 
SLOW FADE UP: 88   EXT . THE RED ROCKS - DAWN 
A horizon. A brim of dawn over the red rocks. The view is framed by the mouth of a cave. Lincoln sleeps within, slumped against the rock, his head bowed heavily. The touch of first light opens his eyes. His brow creasing, as if waking from a bad dream into a worse reality. He looks around only to find himself alone. He gets up, a little shaky at first, then ventures out of the cave. 
He emerges onto a ledge, perhaps fifty feet up. He pauses, eyes adjusting to the quality of light. He sees the storm has reduced to a low wind, combing the floorland o f scrub. Now, across the ledge, he sees Ester. Perched on an outcrop, hugging her knees, watching the sunrise over the desert. He crosses and lowers to a crouch beside her. Ester turns to him with a confused frown- 
ESTER W h e r e did all the green go? Lincoln looks deep into her troubled eyes. He answers gently- 
LINCOLN The r e is no green. The windows in there... they were just pictures. 
Ester absorbs this with difficulty. Lincoln rises again and stands looking out across the desert, into the barren unknown. 
89   EXT . THE SKY OVER THE DESERT - MORNING 
From the massive sky grows a glinting shape. Like a helicopter but sleeker, aquiline. Without combustion, its only noise is the sibilance of blades slicing air. It is known as a "whisper".

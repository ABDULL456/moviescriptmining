WEINER (croaking) Cost you a thousand bucks, if I get it. 
The WALDO coils tighten around WEINER'S throat. 
WEINER All right... boss please let go... P L E A S E ... 
OCK Just get it, Weiner. I'm running out of time. If you fail me again, you won't have to concern yourself with money anymore... DO YOU GET ME CLOWN?! 
WEINER croaks his assent. 
INT. CAFETERIA - NIGHT 
It is all dressed up for a party: LIGHTS, STREAMERS, GLITTER BALL, the WORKS! HARRY is dressed as a SPACEMAN; PETER wears his regular clothes. 
HARRY You should have worn a costume. I told you to wear a costume. 
PETER It's... embarrassing. 
HARRY There's Liz... 
LIZ is crossing the dance floor dressed as an INDIAN PRINCESS in an MINI-DRESS. 
PETER Yeah... 
ROZ, dressed as a COWBOY, ambles over. 
ROZ ... howdy partners. 
PETER/HARRY Hiya, Professor Rosomorf. 
HARRY Any word on Doctor Octavius? 
ROZ (falling in step) Nothing beyond what I read in the papers. I'm afraid he's not the same man we knew. You know, I've been digging through the notes on his experiments... 
PETER follows LIZ with his eyes. She takes a seat at a TABLE next to KIM who wears a HAREM GIRL outfit with the SALAMANDER around her neck. Next to KIM is... SPIDER-MAN! PETER'S eyes go wide. 
ROZ You boys must have had an extraordinary classroom experience. 
PETER (eyeing Spidey) Yes sir... oh... I'm going to be a little late with my paper on the Planetary Conjunction, sir... 
ROZ Whenever you're ready... I'll look at it. I know it's going to be an important work... and Peter, take my hat. 
He hands PETER an oversized TEN GALLON HAT. 
ROZ It is a costume party. 
PETER and HARRY make their way through the dance floor to the table. PETER can't take his eyes off SPIDEY. 
HARRY Look, there's Spider-Man! 
PETER Not the real one, I'm sure... 
HARRY You can never be sure... all kinds of crazy stuff can happen at a masquerade ball... 
PETER I bet I know who it is. 
As they take seats, PETER sees that SPIDER-MAN is trying to read the BUGLE'S sports section by party light. KIM waves. PETER nods and the BIG HAT falls over his face. 
PETER Hiya, Liz... 
LIZ moves to Flash, who's dressed in the SPIDER-MAN costume. 
LIZ Hiya, Peter. Who is in the Spider-Man costume? 
PETER It's a very clever outfit you've got there, Flash. 
FLASH Take a hike, asshole. 
LIZ (to Peter) How did you recognize him? 
PETER His pretty blue eyes give him away... 
HARRY Anyway, who'll be sitting with you at the Halloween Ball? 
LIZ (whispers to Flash) I wanna dance... Hey, Spider-Man... Shall we Flash dance? 
FLASH/SPIDER-MAN Hey, I'm reading the paper, okay? 
LIZ turns with a mild pout. Nervously, PETER ponders his chance. HARRY nudges him. 
HARRY Take her now, it's easy... 
HARRY turns to KIM and does a clanking shimmy in the SPACE SUIT. 
HARRY Wanna dance, Schechrezaa? 
KIM I'm pooped.

MCMURPHY What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore. 
FREDRICKSON It's the questions she asks. 
MCMURPHY Tell 'er to go straight to hell! 
HARDING Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes! 
MCMURPHY (as calm as blue waters) She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy. 
McMurphy grabs Harding by his balls and Harding goes up on his toes. 
MCMURPHY She's peckin' at your balls, buddy, at your ever-lovin' balls. 
Harding is doubled over. 
SEFELT That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend. 
MCMURPHY P.A. What the hell is that? 
SEFELT Potential assaultive. 
FREDRICKSON Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job. 
MCMURPHY Huh? 
HARDING Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair. 
MCMURPHY Tell 'er to go to hell anyway! 
HARDING (CONT'D) And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery. 
MCMURPHY What for? 
HARDING (CONT'D) Lobotomy! 
MCMURPHY Lobotomy? 
HARDING (CONT'D) (pointing to lobotomy case) That! 
McMurphy looks. 
SHOT OF A LOBOTOMY CASE 
A vegetable, complete with two half-dollar scars in his forehead. 
McMURPHY 
As he absorbs this bit of information the basketball rolls to his feet and he picks it up. 
MCMURPHY (to Harding) Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'? 
HARDING Now, what would I be trying to say? 
Martini and Scanlon rush over and try to get the ball. 
SCANLON Gimme the ball! 
MARTINI No. Me! Me! 
WASHINGTON (O.S.) Pass the ball, McMurphy. 
McMurphy crosses to the court, bouncing the ball as he goes. When he reaches the court he holds the ball out to Washington, who reaches for it, but McMurphy snaps it back over his shoulder to Martini. 
MCMURPHY (turning to Martini) Pass it to me, Martini. 
Martini holds back. 
MCMURPHY C'mon, I'll give it back! 
Martini passes to McMurphy. 
MCMURPHY Atta boy, Martini. 
He passes it back to Martini, who laughs and passes it back to McMurphy, who passes it to Scanlon, who passes to McMurphy, who passes to Billy, etc. Bromden just stands watching. 
MCMURPHY (encouraging them) Back and forth, that's it. Shoot, man, we'll be takin' on the New York Knicks before we're through... 
McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them. He catches her eye. She turns away. 
MCMURPHY (V.O) Hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on, I'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit or you sit... 
INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT 
The MUSIC is PLAYING. The TV is on the six o'clock news as McMurphy, cards in hand, is dealing blackjack to Cheswick, Harding, Sefelt, Billy and Martini. Fredrickson and Scanlon are looking on as Bromden eases up to the game. Cheswick is at the nurses' station talking to Big Nurse. 
SEFELT Hit me! 
MCMURPHY Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load. 
SEFELT Boogered! 
McMurphy rakes in Sefelt's cigarettes, adding them to a pile of loose cigarettes, packs of cigarettes, several cartons of cigarettes. 
As Cheswick sits down, depressed: 
MCMURPHY 'Kay, place your bets.

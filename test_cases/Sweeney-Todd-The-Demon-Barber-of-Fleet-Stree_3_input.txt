Todd sees that more and more of the ghastly specters are moving around the room -- multiplying exponentially -- we see the TOURIST, the STUDENT, the PRIEST and others. 
They are more intrusive than they have ever been -- touching Todd -- eagerly preparing him for the finale of his drama -- 
GHOSTS (variously) Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney! 
By now the ghosts are fully Furies, demented and threatening-- 
GHOSTS Sweeney! Sweeeeeeneeeeey...! 
The screeching music transforms into a strange symphony of inarticulate moans and howls and chants, taking us to... 110   INT. SEWERS -- NIGHT                                              110 
GHOSTS (V.O.) Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeneeeeeeeeeeeey... Sweeneysweeneysweeneysweeney... 
Todd and Mrs. Lovett are searching for Toby through a horrible catacomb of decaying sewers. Todd carries a razor. Their voices echo bizarrely: 
MRS. LOVETT Toby! Where are you, love? 
TODD Toby! Where are you, lad?

MRS. LOVETT Nothing's gonna harm you... 
TODD Toby! 
MRS. LOVETT Not while I'm around... 
TODD Toby!

TODD Nothing to be afraid of boy...

Music takes us to... 
111   INT. BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT                                     111 Anthony and Johanna hurry into the barber shop. She is now dressed as a scruffy boy, a cap hiding her hair. She is distracted and disturbed. 
ANTHONY Mr. Todd...? No matter. You wait for him here -- I'll return with the coach in less than half an hour... 
She gently touches Todd's collection of razors... 
ANTHONY Don't worry, darling, in those clothes, no one will recognize you ... You're safe now. 
(CONTINUED) PAGE 109. 111   CONTINUED:                                                  111 
She picks up the largest razor, looks at it, an eerie echo of her father. 
JOHANNA (darkly ironic) Safe ... So we run away and then all our dreams come true? 
ANTHONY I hope so... 
JOHANNA I have never had dreams. Only nightmares. 
ANTHONY Johanna ... When we're free of this place all the ghosts will go away. 
She looks at him very intensely: 
JOHANNA No, Anthony, they never go away. 
He gently touches her face. 
ANTHONY I'll be right back to you ... Half an hour and we'll be free. 
He goes. 
She turns to the window, watches him go. Her expression is sad: he will never fully comprehend her depth. 
Then she sees the Beggar Woman approaching from across the street... 
112   EXT. PIE SHOP -- NIGHT                                       112 
The Beggar Woman begins climbing the stairs to the barber shop: 
BEGGAR WOMAN Beadle ... Beadle ... No good hiding, I saw you! Are you in there still? 
113   INT. BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT                                    113 
Johanna hears the Beggar Woman singing, climbing the stairs.

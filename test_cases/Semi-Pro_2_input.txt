LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS THING! 
LET'S HEAR IT FOR DUKES! 
INT. LYNN'S HOUSE - MEANWHILE 
A beautiful, down to earth woman, LYNN, 30's, is reading a book. In the background, her boyfriend, KYLE, is listening to the Tropics game on the RADIO. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Monix was an All-American at Michigan State, but then went on to a disappointing journeyman career in the NBA. But he did manage to sit on the bench with the world champion Boston Celtics years ago and won a ring. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.0. ) (on radio) I should hire his agent. Kyle listens to this and yells to the other room. 
KYLE Hey honey, guess who got traded to Flint? 
LYNN I don't know, who? 
KYLE Monix. The word Monix stops her in her tracks. 
LYNN Monix? 
KYLE Yeah! He's already got an NBA ring, but he's still playing... In Flint. Can you believe it? 
LYNN No, I can't. Lynn closes her book, fidgety... 
KYLE They say he asked to be traded. Who the Hell leaves California to come here? I love this guy. 
MUSIC CUE: THE BROTHERS JOHNSON 'GET THE FUNK OUTTA MY FACE.' 
EXT./INT. JACKIE'S MONTE CARLO - NIGHT 
Jackie cruises the streets of Flint in a pimped out Monte Carlo. He's got chrome rims and a gold grill. The interior is wall to wall carpeting. He swigs a beer as he turns. 
JACKIE MOON (singing with car stereo) Get the funk outta-of-my-face... A SIGN SAYS: THE KREMLIN. Jackie rolls up and parks in a reserved parking space. He rolls up the windows and locks the doors by hand and exits. 
REVEAL: JACKIE HAS GIANT ICE PACKS TAPED TO HIS KNEES, Patrick Ewing style, right over his slacks. A police officer drinks, in uniform, outside. 
COP What's up Jackie? 
JACKIE MOON Not much. 
COP (re: the big ice packs) Your knees okay? 
JACKIE MOON Oh yeah. Just icing them down. 
INT. THE KREMLIN - NIGHT 
'The Kremlin' is rocking. The beer is served in cans only. 
BALL GIRL MAGGIE (O.S.) Hey Jackie! 
JACKIE MOON Well look at you! You look beautiful. What's different? 
BALL GIRL MAGGIE I dyed my hair. 
JACKIE MOON No, that's not it... Did your tits get bigger? 
BALL GIRL MAGGIE No. 
JACKIE MOON Don't lie to me. Those things got bigger. 
BALL GIRL MAGGIE No, they're the same. 
JACKIE MOON Well, good job. Jackie keeps walking, bumping into MS. QUINCY, Clarence's mother. 
MS. QUINCY Yo Jackie. You know, that wife of yours has been making out with that Mark Spitz lookin' motherfucker all night. She gestures to a guy who's lip-locked with Jackie's wife. LUCY MOON unbuttons her fur coat. 
JACKIE MOON Oh. It's okay, Lucy and I've got an open relationship. 
MS. QUINCY I know that. But he's about to suck on her Damn tits, right here in front of all these people. 
JACKIE MOON She's hot right? What can I say, we're freedom lovers. (calling off to his wife) Hey honey! Lucy Moon ignores him, only making out harder. 
JACKIE MOON (to his wife) Right on! (to Quincy) I'm not jealous. It's a sweet deal for both of us. 
MS. QUINCY Have you ever slept with another woman? 
JACKIE MOON I could. That's the beauty of it. No ball and chain here.

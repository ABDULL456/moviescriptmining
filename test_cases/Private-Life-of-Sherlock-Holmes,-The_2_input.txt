WATSON (removing diploma from wall) Actually, I'm rather looking forward to it. Leading a normal life again. Regular office hours -- nine to three -- and if occasionally there's an emergency call in the middle of the night, I know it's going be appendicitis and not an ax murder. Let Holmes go mucking about in the fog and the sleet, looking for a bloodstained collar-button out on the moors, with some demented hound snapping at his behind -- 
From the living room comes the sound of a revolver shot. Mrs. Hudson screams and Watson looks off in alarm. Then he races out of the room, diploma in hand, followed by Mrs. Hudson. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
As they burst into the room, they see Holmes sitting on the stool beside the chemistry table, a revolver in his hand. He has shattered one of the narcotics bottles on the mantelpiece, and is aiming at a second one. 
MRS. HUDSON Mr. Holmes... 
Holmes fires, smashing the second bottle. As Mrs. Hudson takes a step forward, he waves her away with the gun. 
HOLMES Please, Mrs. Hudson.    You're in my line of fire. 
Watson jerks Mrs.   Hudson back as Holmes lets go with another shot. The    bullet disposes of the third bottle, splattering glass   and liquid all over the place. Holmes rises calmly from   the stool, crosses to the desk, puts the revolver away   in a drawer. 
MRS. HUDSON (outraged) How many times have I told you I will not tolerate pistol practice on my premises? I should have evicted you when you shot them holes in my wall. 
She points up to a spot near the ceiling. Neatly traced in bullet holes are the initials V.R., with a small crown above them. 
HOLMES Merely celebrating Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee. 
MRS. HUDSON Look at that mess you made -- 
Watson is looking at Holmes with a little smile on his face. 
WATSON It's all right, Mrs. Hudson. I'll clean it up -- (hands her the diploma) -- while you unpack my things. 
MRS. HUDSON Unpack? 
HOLMES You heard him. 
A bewildered Mrs. Hudson goes back into the bedroom. Watson crosses to the fireplace, picks up the whiskbroom and the coal shovel, starts cleaning up the broken glass. 
WATSON Thank you, Holmes. I know how difficult it must've been for you -- 
HOLMES Not really. It was simple choice between a bad habit and a good companion. 
WATSON You've made me very happy. 
HOLMES I've often been accused of being cold and unemotional. I admit to it. And yet, in my cold, unemotional way, I'm very fond of you, Watson. 
WATSON I know that. But one likes to hear these things occasionally. 
He notices the violin, which has been splattered with the liquid from the shattered bottle, picks it up. 
WATSON Look at this. Covered with that nasty stuff. I'd better dry it off. 
HOLMES I'll do it. 
He takes the instrument, and dabbing it with a handkerchief, carries it toward the violin case. 
WATSON For a moment, I was worried that you were going to let me walk out -- that you weren't even going to try to stop me. 
HOLMES Now, Watson -- you know there's nothing I wouldn't do to keep you here. 
With a side-glance at the busy Watson, he opens the violin case. Neatly stashed away around the edges are the three original bottles of narcotics. The ones he shot up, of course, were substitutes from the chemistry set. He places the violin carefully among the bottles, closes the case, snaps the locks. As he moves off, we STAY on the violin case. 
WATSON'S VOICE It was not the first not the last time he tricked me like that. Normally, I was inclined to forgive him... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Watson, in his dressing gown, is sitting at the table, finishing his coffee. In front of him is a letter, on blue note-paper, and a pair of theatre tickets. 
WATSON'S VOICE But on one occasion, he did something that was so utterly unforgivable, that I would gladly have murdered him -- had it not been for my saintly disposition. 
Watson sets down his coffee cup, picks up the letter and the tickets, rises from his chair. He starts to pace -- addressing Holmes, who is off-scene. 
WATSON Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes? Why won't you go? It's the final performance of the Imperial Russian Ballet -- the house has been sold out for months -- 
He moves towards the door of -- 
HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAY 
Holmes is sitting in a hip-bath with a high back, soaping himself. Watson appears in the doorway. 
WATSON -- seats are going for a guinea apiece -- 
HOLMES That's precisely it. Why should someone send up two free tickets? Anonymously, at that. 
WATSON Whoever sent them must be in great distress. The note says --

{"train": "GRU Because my house is made of candy and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems. \nThe girl starts to ask another question. \nLITTLE GIRL How come you have- \nGru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face.   She COUGHS. \nGRU Okay!   Time for cake! \nAs the kids run to the table, Agnes approaches Gru. \nAGNES Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're the best fairy princess ever! \nGru smiles. \nGRU (in falsetto) You are welcome, little girl. \nShe runs off, but quickly returns. \nAGNES (whispers in his ear) I know it's really you, Gru. I'm just pretending for the other kids. \nShe runs off again to join her friends. Gru watches her go. Couldn't be happier. Then he is approached by JILLIAN, a heavily-Botoxed mom. \nJILLIAN Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the Party! \nGRU (forcing a smile) Hello, Jillian. \nJILLIAN Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and... DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   7. \nIn the background, a homely NATALIE leans against a buffet table and seductively raises her eyebrows at Gru. The table collapses to the ground beneath her. \nGRU (realizes what's going on) No, no, no, get off of the limb right now. No limb. \nJILLIAN Oh, come on...she's a riot. She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her... \nIn the background, Natalie inadvertently walks in front of a bottle pitch game, is struck by a ball, and falls to the ground. \nGRU No, Jill's, that is not happening. Seriously. I'm fine. \nJILLIAN (calling after Gru) Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How about my cousin Linda? \nGru walks off, passing by Edith and Margo. \nGRU No. \nJILLIAN Oh, oh! I know someone whose husband just died! \nSPLASH!   Suddenly Jillian is sprayed in the face with water. \nReveal Gru holding a HOSE with a SPRAY NOZZLE. \nGRU I'm sorry.     I did not see you there. \nSPLASH!   He sprays her again.    She falls down. \nGRU (CONT'D) Or there. \nHe drops the hose and walks away, CHUCKLING softly.

The screen analyzes Kyle and a readout comes out as \"SPECIES: UNKNOWN.\" Kyle sniffs Gru's flowers. \nGRU Kyle... Kyle! \nThen it analyzes Gru and the readout says \"TARGET ACQUIRED.\" \nGRU (CONT'D) Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your business on the petunias! \nKyle lifts up his leg next to Gru's flowers. \nHe picks Kyle up and places him next to his neighbor's bush. \nLucy sees this, drives forward, and opens the convertible top, causing the Minions to land right in the passenger's seat. They strike threatening karate poses. DESPICABLE ME 2                CINCO & KEN DRAFT   11. \nTOM AND STUART Hi-YAH!! \nLucy tases them and they pass out.       She floors it. \nEXT: STREET - SAME \nLucy's car continues driving until it reaches a crowded PIER. And doesn't stop. It drives right off the end of the pier. A confused fisherman leaps for his life. \nCONFUSED FISHERMAN What the--     Oh! \nSPLASH! \nINT: OCEAN - SAME \nLucy's car now transforms into an UNDERWATER VEHICLE. As the minions come to, one of them tries playing with the radio until Lucy slaps his hand away. They speed through the sea and an octopus slams into her windshield. She turns on the wipers, which hits the octopus in the face until he's had enough and swims off in a cloud of ink. \nShe HONKS her HORN as she passes through a school of fish. \nMINIONS Whoa... \nAs the fish pass the Minions look ahead to see a shark heading for them with his mouth open. They SCREAM. Lucy quickly steers the car out of harm's way. They pass by several more sharks until they arrive at a GIANT SUBMARINE with the letters \"AVL\" on the side. \nA HATCH opens and Lucy's car goes inside.       The hatch closes behind her. \nINT: AVL SUB - SAME \nThe water drains out from the holding dock. A buffer and hair dryer come out to dry off the car. A squeegee wipes off the windshield. \nThen the platform the car is on lowers down. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   12. \nINT: AVL ROOM - DAY \nLucy's car lowers into the center of the room as a large circular table assembles around it, effectively locking them in. \nLucy and the Minions get out of the car. She pushes a button on her remote and Gru, with a starfish attached to his head, is ejected from the trunk. \nGRU (groggily) Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh, foot's asleep...ah...pins and needles... \nSILAS (O.S.) Good afternoon, Mr. Gru. \nGRU Ehhh... \nSILAS I apologize for our methods in getting you here. \nLUCY I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I enjoyed that. Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually. \nSILAS That's enough, Agent Wilde. \nLUCY Sorry, sir. \nGRU Okay, this is bogus! \nGru peels the starfish off his head and drops it onto Tom's. Stuart LAUGHS at him. \nGRU (CONT'D) I don't know who you people think you are, but-- \nA WAITER comes over with tea for Silas. \nSILAS We are the Anti-Villain League. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   13. \nAs Silas summons a map that shows all of the AVL offices around the world, Lucy's car drops out of the way. Stuart is trapped on the lowering platform and he scrambles to get back onto stable ground. Silas continues. \nSILAS (CONT'D) An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale. Rob a bank? We're not interested. Kill someone? Not our deal. But you want to melt the polar ice caps? Or vaporize Mt. Fuji? Or even steal the moon? Then we notice. \nGRU First of all, you've got no proof that I did that. Second, after I did do that, I put it back! \nSILAS We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru. That's why we've brought you here. (beat) I am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom. \nUpon hearing the name, Tom and Stuart start giggling. \nTOM Bottom. \nTOM AND STUART Heeheheeeeheeehee. \nSilas bristles at this, and glances over at Lucy. \nGRU (whispers) Hey, I told you guys to get to bed. \nMARGO Oh, sorry. \nEDITH So when ya goin' on your date? \nGRU What? \nEDITH Remember? Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you. \nGRU Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.    And I'm not going on any date. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    17. \nEDITH Why not?    Are you scared? \nGru stares back at Edith.     Gets a far-away look in his eyes. \nEXT: PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - DAY \nWe flash back to LITTLE GRU on the school playground. He stares, lovesick, at a CUTE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, named LISA. \nLISA (to her friends) Hey, did you guys see the moon landing on TV? \nGIRLS Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so cool... \nLISA Yeah, and you know what-- \nGru approaches her. \nLITTLE GRU Excuse me, Lisa? \nBut she doesn't notice him.    He tries again. \nLISA (to her friends) I was talking to Billy the other day. \nGIRLS No way. \nLISA He is so cute. \nGru clears his throat. \nLISA (CONT'D) And I think he likes me. \nGRU Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you-- \nGru reaches out and taps her shoulder with his pointer finger. \nThen one of the other little girls points to Gru's finger on Lisa's shoulder. DESPICABLE ME 2                 CINCO & KEN DRAFT   18. \nGIRL Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru touched Lisa! \nThe other girls turn and squeal, horrified. \nGIRLS Eeeeewww! \nA little buck-toothed red-haired girl shouts out to the entire playground. \nRED HAIRED GIRL Lisa's got Grooties! \nThe playground erupts with SCREAMS and everyone turns and runs away. \nLittle Gru is left alone.     Crushed. \nINT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGru comes out of the flashback. \nGRU Scared? Of what? Women?! No, that's bonkers! I just-- I have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed. I'm not scared-- of women... or dates... let's go to bed. \nGru gives each girl a goodnight kiss. \nGRU (CONT'D) Goodnight, Edith. \nThen he goes over to Margo, who's already in bed. \nGRU (CONT'D) Goodnight, Margo. \nShe continues texting as he gives her a kiss. \nKEVIN Cacao! \nAnd then Stuart dressed as a little girl with pigtails. \nSTUART Papadam? \nEXT: MALL - DAY \nEstablishing. \nINT: MALL - SAME \nGru comes down the escalator wearing the sunglasses, with the three disguised Minions behind him. Stuart gets his dress caught in the escalator. It comes off and he hides in a nearby potted plant. \nGru glances at a store called the \"EAGLE HAIR CLUB.\" He then arrives at a charming, pink CUPCAKE STORE. The sign reads, \"BAKE MY DAY\" Gru frowns and takes off his sunglasses. \nGRU Hm.     \"Bake My Day.\"   Blech. \nINT: BAKE MY DAY - CONTINUOUS \nGru unlocks the door and enters. JINGLE! BELLS on the door ring. The inside is sugary and clean and quaint. Gru takes it all in. Then turns to the minions. \nGRU Alright, here is the cupcake recipe I got off the internet. \nThe minions excitedly grab the recipe and head for the kitchen. Gru kicks Stuart, who is still staggering around in the potted plant. \nGRU (CONT'D) And don't go nuts with the sprinkles! \nGru is left alone. He looks around. Sees a BUNNY CUPCAKE in a glass cake dish. Then a SHARK CUPCAKE in the next cake dish. And in the next dish he sees Lucy's head. She makes a funny face. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     27. \nGru SCREAMS, which causes Lucy to SCREAM and jump up, hitting her head on one of the shelves, sending all of the CUPCAKES flying. \nLucy immediately goes into action, using incredible and frankly weird-looking MARTIAL ARTS MOVES to dispatch the cupcakes as they fly toward her. \nLUCY Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay- ay-ay-ay! \nShe successfully eliminates all of the cupcakes, then turns to Gru, out of breath. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Whoo. Wasn't expecting that. (strikes a martial arts pose) Or was I? \nGru has a cupcake stuck to the top of his head, frosting side down. Lucy gestures as if he's got a little food on his face. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Ooh... you got... You got... a little... \nThe cupcake slowly slides down, then falls to the floor.    It leaves a long smear on Gru's face. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Here, I'll-- I'll get it. \nGru stands frozen as she tries to clean him up. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Oh, that's just spreading...um... \nGRU Alright, alright.    I got it.    I got it!... Stop it! \nLucy backs off. \nLUCY Oh!     I'll let you get it. \nGru SIGHS and wipes the frosting off his face. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   28. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Yeah, what you just saw there was a little something new I've been working on. It's a combination of Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare, and krumping. \nGRU Okay, that's weird--why are you here? \nLUCY On assignment from Silas.   I'm your new partner. Yay! \nGRU What?! No, no \"yay.\" Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner. \nLUCY Well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you. But not me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway. \nGru is about to respond when Dave the minion comes out the kitchen door. He carries a cupcake in the shape of a Minion. \nDAVE Walla! \nImmediately Lucy moves with lightning-quick reflexes. She smashes his cupcake, flips him into the air, and pins him to the counter. Dave SCREAMS. \nLUCY You know this guy? \nHe flexes and makes it wave.     Gru hides his eyes. \nGRU Look away! \nLucy stares at it. \nLUCY You-- Whoa... Hooo... \nEDUARDO Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled! I pick `em up next week! Have a good day. Come by if you get a chance, okay? \nHe exits.    Gru GROANS, relieved.    Finally! \nThen Eduardo pops back in. \nEDUARDO (CONT'D) And welcome to the mall family! \nGru studies Eduardo's face and GASPS. He pictures Eduardo in a red luchador mask surrounded by flames. Eduardo turns and leaves. As soon as the door closes-- \nGRU (whispers) El Macho. \nLUCY What? \nGRU But it couldn't be... DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT      32. \nLUCY Wha-- What? What couldn't be?? \nGRU That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho. From about twenty years ago. \nEXT: DESERT - DAY - FLASHBACK \nClassic Spaghetti western sepia-toned shot of El Macho looking menacing. He looks like the large Hispanic man from the mall, only younger and wearing a Lucha Libre outfit and mask (a mask which looks similar to the one Gru imagined). \nEl Macho pushes the BARKEEP out of the way and grabs a large bottle from behind the bar. \nGRU (V.O.) He was ruthless. He was dangerous. And as the name implies, very macho. \nEl Macho pours himself a shot and then smashes the bottle over his own head. \nHe reaches down and pulls up a rattlesnake from below the bar. He squeezes its head, squirting venom into the shot glass. He drinks it down and then eats the glass. \nHe sticks the snake's fangs into a few dollars that he leaves on the bar, before breaking through the wall behind him, leaving an EL Macho-shaped hole. \nEXT: STREET - DAY - FLASHBACK \nEl Macho head butts an armored truck and approaches the passenger side window. \nGRU (V.O.) He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands. \nWhen the ARMED GUARDS look over he punches through the bullet- proof glass, knocking them both out of the truck. Then he lifts the truck onto his back and runs down the street with it. \nGRU (V.O.) Ah, but sadly, like all the greats, El Macho was gone too soon. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    33. \nEXT: SKY - DAY - PAST \nA bird, flying in the air, is suddenly struck by an airplane. \nGRU (V.O.) He died in the most macho way possible. \nEl Macho leaps out of the plane riding a SHARK, a ton of DYNAMITE strapped to him. He plummets toward the mouth of an ACTIVE VOLCANO. \nGRU (V.O.) Riding a shark with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest into the mouth of an active volcano. \nHe pulls two grenades from behind his back, yanks the pins, and holds onto them as he plunges into the volcano. \nThere is a MASSIVE EXPLOSION. \nGRU (V.O.) It was glorious. \nINT: BAKE MY DAY - DAY \nLucy stares at Gru, confused. \nLUCY Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead... \nGRU They never found the body. Oh no. All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair. (beat) But... that face. It has got to be El Macho. \nLucy gets an excited look on her face. \nMINIONS Hey! \nPull back to reveal many minions singing and dancing. \nWe move through the crowd, passing by the mace-wielding minion with his helmet still backwards and a smaller server minion with a tray of ice cream sundaes in mugs. \nWe cut up to the rafters, where more minions are dancing and singing in formation, jumping and hopping all over the place in elaborate dance routines. \nBack on the floor, three arm-in-arm minions take the chorus. One of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being held up by the other two. \nAnother minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral staircase, but he's knocked off by a bunch of minions running up the other way. \nSeveral minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream, lazily sipping at it through long straws. \nGru enters and takes it all in. \nOther minions raid an ice cream cart, hanging from the canopy, drinking directly from the spouts. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    37. \nGRU Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no, no! Hey, please! \nThe Minions stop singing. \nGRU (CONT'D) Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay? (points) Dave, Stuart--come this way. With me! Come on! \nDave downs a jar of maraschino cherries and sprays whip cream into his mouth before running after them, with a toothpick umbrella in his mouth for good measure. \nGRU (O.S.) (CONT'D) Come on! \nOnce they are gone, the Minions go back to singing and laughing. \nINT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMargo, Edith and Agnes are fast asleep in their beds. Kevin and Jerry sing them a lullaby. Then smile and quietly close the door. \nINT: HALLWAY - SAME \nKevin holds up a golf ball.   Jerry happily jumps up and down. \nKEVIN Hey, putt-putt? \nJERRY Oh! \nINT: LIVING ROOM - LATER \nJerry puts the tee and ball in his mouth as Kevin stands on a dresser, preparing to take a swing. He asks Jerry if he's ready and Jerry gives a thumbs up. \nKEVIN Una, doo-- (laughs as he lowers the golf club to Jerry's head) DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     38. \nCRASH! CLANG! A noise comes from the backyard.      The minions exchange looks. What was that? \nEXT: BACKYARD - NIGHT \nKevin and Jerry step out into the yard and look around nervously, armed only with the golf club and tee. \nKEVIN Boca! \nJERRY (scared) Boca! \nThey walk over to the garbage cans. The cans begins to rattle. Kevin and Jerry SCREAM as a CAT pops up from one of the cans. The cat MEOWS. \nKevin LAUGHS at him and imitates Jerry's scared face. \nKEVIN Looka too! \nJerry slaps him.    Kevin slaps him back.   They start to slap fight until-- \nA SPOTLIGHT comes down from above, lighting up the terrified minions. Before they can scream... \nWOOSH! Jerry is sucked up into the air as if being abducted by aliens. Kevin grabs onto a flower, and then the cat to try and anchor himself down, but they both fly up into the air. \nThe light goes out. A few seconds later the light comes back on and drops the cat back down. It turns off again and the Minions are gone. \nEXT: MALL - NIGHT \nThe mall is dark and the parking lot is empty, except for two minions and Lucy's car. \nINT: MALL - SAME \nGRU (dazed) Ugh... \nLUCY What is wrong with that chicken? (beat) Hey, that pollo? Es loco. \nGru is unimpressed. \nLUCY (CONT'D) (noticing Gru's wounds) No? Okay, let's go. \nINT: KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nGru and Lucy step into the kitchen. Lucy pulls out a HIGH- TECH SCANNING DEVICE and aims it around the kitchen. \nGRU You getting anything? \nLUCY No. Not yet. But hey, maybe you can find something with these x-ray goggles. \nLucy produces a pair of HIGH TECH goggles.    Gru shakes his head. \nGRU (skeptically) Bah... \nGru puts them on and looks around the kitchen.    We now see the room from his X-RAY POV. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   42. \nLUCY (O.S.) How're they working? Tell me, tell me! \nGru turns to Lucy and sees her as a SKELETON. \nGRU Ahh!   Ooof! \nLUCY What's wrong? Something wrong? \nGRU Oh, that's an image I'll never get out of my brain. Blagh! \nGru makes a face, disturbed. Then quickly turns away and spots something behind a painting on the wall...a safe. Sees something inside it--a METAL CANISTER. Smiles. \nGRU (CONT'D) I knew it! \nHe goes to the wall and removes the painting, revealing the SAFE. \nGRU (CONT'D) The serum is in here! \nLUCY Ooh, then let's get it! \nHe produces a SAFE-CRACKING DEVICE and places it over the combination wheel. Lights blink and it goes to work. \nGRU (gleefully giggling) Oh, this is going to be good! Ahh... \nCLICK. The safe opens, revealing--a JAR OF SALSA (\"EDUARDO'S SECRET RECIPE\"). \nGRU (CONT'D) A-ha! (registering it's not the serum) What? It's... salsa? \nLUCY (disappointed) Awww man. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       43. \nINT: RESTAURANT - SAME \nEduardo enters the restaurant.   Senses something isn't right. Frowns angrily. \nEDUARDO Oh... somebody's going to die tonight. \nHe cautiously walks through the restaurant. Sees the chicken in the ball of cement. Gasps. \nEDUARDO (CONT'D) Pollito! \nEduardo runs over to Pollito and picks him up. \nEDUARDO (CONT'D) What'd they do to you? Pollito? Can you hear me? \nPOLLITO Boc! \nEDUARDO Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken? What? Who's there? \nHis eyes darken. \nINT: KITCHEN - SAME \nGru and Lucy, who are ravenously eating the delicious salsa with chips, turn to the door. Uh-oh. \nINT: RESTAURANT - SAME \nCRASH! Lucy's car plummets towards the ground. Gru SCREAMS hysterically, but Lucy just hits a button and the car TRANSFORMS into a jet. \nThey fly off into the night sky. \nEXT: GRU'S NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING \nIt's a beautiful morning. An ICE CREAM TRUCK makes its way down the street (playing the song the minions were singing earlier). It stops and a couple of CHILDREN run to meet it. \nStuart opens Gru's front door, having heard the commotion. Two other minions approach as well. Stuart spots the ice cream truck and points to it, excited. \nSTUART Oh!   Oh!   Gelato! \nAnd then suddenly a MOB OF MINIONS appears running for the ice cream truck alongside the group of children. The minions shove the children aside and clamor around the truck holding out their money. \nMINIONS Gelato!     Gelato! Gelato! \nStuart pushes himself to the top of the unruly pack and tries to maintain order. \nSTUART Stopa!    Stopa!! \nA hush comes over the minions. \nSTUART (CONT'D) (knocking on the truck) Hey-ho! Gelato! \nSuddenly the ice cream cone on top of the truck transforms into a LARGE TUBE and extends itself above the minions. Stuart offers the tube a wad of cash and attempts to order gelato, but the it begins SUCKING the minions into it. ZUP! ZUP! ZUP! \nOne by one the minions (dozens of them, including the minion with his head still trapped in the jelly jar) are sucked into the truck until there is only one left. He tries to make a break for it, but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of him. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      47. \nHe licks it, his tongue sticks, and he is yanked back into the ice cream cone. The it closes and the truck drives away. \nThe children look on puzzled. \nEXT: PARADISE MALL - DAY \nThe hole that Lucy's car crashed through last night has been patched with plywood boards. \nINT: PARADISE MALL - DAY \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL that Gru is inside a GARBAGE CAN DISGUISE. Next to him is Lucy, also in a GARBAGE CAN DISGUISE, using binoculars. \nLUCY (O.S.) All right, there he is.   Suspect #8: Floyd Eaglesan. \nBINOCULARS POV \nFloyd Eaglesan attempts to entice a customer to visit his business, Eagle Hair Club. \nGRU Oh.    Okay. \nLUCY See if you can get closer. Go...go. \nGru quickly stands up, revealing his legs, and takes several steps toward Eagle Hair Club. Floyd looks over his shoulder, and Gru stops. Floyd enters Eagle Hair Club and Gru inches closer. \nGRU Alright, what do-- \nBINOCULARS POV \nSuddenly a MAN approaches the trash can with a steaming cup of coffee. The binoculars readout says \"WARNING! EXTREMELY HOT.\" \nGRU (CONT'D) (to himself) Oh no. That's not good. \nThe man goes to throw the coffee in the trash and we see Gru's legs pop out from beneath the can. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      48. \nThe man looks confused and tries again.     Gru dodges and takes off running. The man chases after him. \nGru accidentally knocks into a bent-over woman's rear end. Insulted, she turns around, sees the man with the coffee, and slaps him across the face. Unfortunately, Gru doesn't see the escalator ahead and goes tumbling down the moving stairs. \nCRASH! BANG! CLANG! Finally, Gru pops out of the trash can and lands at the bottom of the escalator with a THUD! Flat on his face, he hears a familiar voice call out. \nAGNES (O.S.) Hey Gru! \nGru looks up and sees Margo, Edith and Agnes. \nGRU Oh! Girls! What are you doing here? \nMARGO Well, we thought we'd come visit you at work. (looks at Gru and the trash can) So, you're saving the world in a garbage can? \nGRU (sarcastically) Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...funny. \nThey begin walking away together, then Margo is reminded of her sisters when Edith loudly clears her throat. \nMARGO (CONT'D) Um...I'll catch up with you guys later. Bye! \nShe turns and runs after Antonio. \nEDITH Can I be the first to say...Ewwww! \nAgnes grabs Edith and shakes her. \nAGNES We gotta go tell Gru! \nEXT: EAGLE HAIR CLUB - DAY \nGru approaches Eagle Hair Club. \nGRU All right, I'm going in. \nLUCY (IN HEADPHONES) If it picks up any traces of the serum the sensor in your belt buckle-- \nGru activates the high-tech scanning device on his belt buckle. \nINT: BAKE MY DAY - SAME \nLucy is in the cupcake shop monitoring the scanning device results. She can hear him and see from his POV. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   52. \nLUCY --will make a sound like this-- MEE- MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!! \nGRU (annoyed) Okay! I get it!     I get it! \nINT: EAGLE HAIR CLUB - SAME \nGru fumbles with the automatic door, then enters Eagle Hair Club. \nFLOYD (O.S.) (chuckles) Welcome to Eagle Hair Club. \nAt the reception desk, a large chair shaped like an eagle spins around. Sitting in the chair is Floyd, looking sinister and petting a FURRY OBJECT that looks like a cat. \nFLOYD (CONT'D) It's about time you showed up...Mr. Gru. \nHis pet BALD EAGLE perched next to him SQUAWKS. \nGRU You...know my name? \nFLOYD (chuckles) When someone moves into the mall who is follically challenged, I make it my business to know all about them. You are bald. And that is bad. \nHe strokes the furry object. Kisses it.    Then places it on a MANNEQUIN HEAD. It's a TOUPEE. \nFLOYD (CONT'D) There you go, my sweet. \nINT: BAKE MY DAY - SAME \nLucy monitors the chem-tracking device from inside the shop. \nLUCY I'm getting nothing so far. I think you need to move around. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      53. \nINT: EAGLE HAIR CLUB - SAME \nGru listens in on the headphones. \nHe steps over to a wall on which hangs a PAINTING of Floyd flying with eagles. \nGRU Wow, this looks interesting.     What is it? \nGru thrusts his hips at the painting.    Floyd watches him, suspicious. \nFLOYD I take it you're an art lover? \nLUCY (IN HEADPHONES) No serum. \nGRU Yeah, not so much. \nHe walks over to a podium with a TROPHY.     He thrusts his hips at that, too. \nGRU (CONT'D) Oh, how about this impressive trinket? \nFLOYD I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr. Gru. \nThe music continues and Eduardo dances across the floor and out into the mall where he grabs a passing SHOPPER and pulls her into the restaurant. \nThe confused woman holds on for the ride    as Eduardo twirls and dances her all around the floor. He     dips her and she melts, as do all of the women watching.     Eduardo gazes into the woman's eyes and produces a business    card. \nEDUARDO Kids eat free on Tuesdays. \nThe woman grabs the business card from his hand with her teeth. \nThen Eduardo flings her across the floor and she twirls back out into the mall where she knocks over her confused husband. Then the song comes to an end and Eduardo strikes a final pose. \nEveryone in the studio cheers. \nGIRLS Yeah!   Wahoo! Cool!   Awesome! \nEveryone except Gru.   Eduardo walks over to him and gives him a big warm hug. \nEDUARDO So good to see you again, mi compadre! \nGru tries to get out of the hug as quickly as he can. \nANTONIO Oh, I see you have already met my father. \nGRU What the-- Father?! \nEDUARDO Si! Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh? Come, sit, let me get you something. \nGru looks down and sees Eduardo's chicken glaring at him.    It SQUAWKS. It's unsettling. \nGRU Oh... look at you. \nEduardo scoops the chicken up. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT     57. \nGRU (CONT'D) (nervous) Haha. He likes me! \nGru tries to pet the chicken but Pollito lunges at him. \nEDUARDO Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is usually very friendly. (cradling Pollito) He had a rough night. \nThe chicken stares relentlessly.   Gru CHUCKLES nervously. \nGRU Well, we really should be going. Girls, come on. \nGru tries to gather the girls, but Eduardo stops him, pushing Antonio and Margo closer together. \nEDUARDO That is a pity. Young love is beautiful, no? \nGRU No! (chuckling nervously) You know, they're not in love. They hardly know each other! \nEduardo suddenly lights up, having an idea. \nEDUARDO You are right, Cabeza de Huevo! They must get to know each other better. Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party? \nGRU No, no, I am-- \nGIRLS Si! \nThe girls are all thrilled at this, as is Antonio. As if on cue, MUSIC begins playing and they all begin dancing together. \nAntonio takes Margo's hand and twirls her across the floor. Gru stares at Antonio with a look that could kill. A waiter comes by to give Gru a party drink, and he promptly crushes the glass with his bare hands. His eye twitches. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT   58. \nINT: AVL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT \nGru and Lucy sit across from Silas at headquarters. \nSILAS I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect? After the whole salsa incident? \nGRU Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy. You need to arrest him immediately. And his deviously charming son. I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too. The son also. You've got to get the son. \nGru approaches Silas. \nGRU (CONT'D) (whispers) I think that the son is the mastermind. There's a look. There's a devilish look in his eyes and I don't like it! \nSILAS Yes, but I don't really see any evidence for-- \nGRU Evidence schmevidence! I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho! Lock him up! Lock up the son. Don't forget about the son. The kid gives me the creeps! \nSilas takes a deep breath and rubs his temples. \nGRU Agnes! Agnes!     Tell Jillian I'm not here! \nAgnes turns to the door. \nAGNES Gru's not here! \nJILLIAN Are you sure? \nAGNES Yes!   He just told me! \nGru, panicking, shakes his head and wags his fingers. \nAGNES (CONT'D) I mean no, he didn't just tell me! \nJILLIAN (laughs) Agnes--where is Gru? \nGru makes the \"zip your lips\" gesture. \nAGNES He's putting on lipstick! \nGru waves his arms. \nAGNES (CONT'D) He's swatting at flies! DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     62. \nGru waves his hand around his throat, making a \"cut it off\" gesture. \nAGNES (CONT'D) He's...chopping his head off! \nGru clenches his fists and grunts in frustration. \nAGNES (CONT'D) He's...pooping? \nOutside, Jillian and Shannon look confused. \nJILLIAN (O.S.) I know you're in there, Gru! There's no way you're getting out of this! \nKyle enters the room, carrying the bag with the wig in his mouth. \nEXT: RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nEstablishing. \nINT: RESTAURANT - SAME \nShannon sits at a table talking to Gru, who's offscreen.    A waiter drops off a plate of spaghetti. \nSHANNON I have to tell you, I was so nervous about tonight. I mean there's just so many phonies out there! \nCUT TO Gru sitting across from her. Wearing a ridiculous WIG from Floyd. And looking extremely uncomfortable. \nGRU Yes, I hear you. (awkwardly laughs) \nSHANNON Oh, so do you work out? \nGRU Well... \nSHANNON I mean, obviously, you don't, but would you consider it? Huh? (MORE) DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    63. \nSHANNON (CONT'D) Physical fitness is very important to Shannon. As you can tell, right? Huh? \nShannon drops to the floor and starts doing push-ups. \nGRU Ah.   I can tell. \nSHANNON (mid-push-up) Solid. \nShe switches to one-armed push-ups. \nGRU We are in a restaurant, you know. \nGru looks even more uncomfortable. \nJust then Lucy (unseen by Gru) enters the restaurant.     She approaches the HOSTESS. \nLUCY Hi.   Takeout for Lucy? \nHOSTESS Sure, just a sec. \nGru and Lucy sit on the front steps of Shannon's house. \nLUCY Well, I think you did it. You just officially had the worst date ever. \nGRU Huh, tell me about it. \nLUCY Don't worry--it can only get better from here, right? But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun. I've had to use it on one or two dates myself. \nGRU Yeah, you know, as far as dates go, I think I'm good with just the one. \nGru and Lucy exchange looks.   He CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY.   Time to go. \nLUCY Well, good night, partner. \nShe pats his shoulder and walks toward her car.   Gru gets up to walk beside her. \nLUCY (CONT'D) This was fun. \nGRU Yes.   Surprisingly, it was. \nLUCY Oh, and uh, just between you and me? You look much better bald. DESPICABLE ME 2                CINCO & KEN DRAFT    67. \nThey smile at each other, and she gives him a peck on the cheek and walks away. \nLUCY (CONT'D) See you tomorrow! \nGru smiles a big smile. Shannon slumps over on the porch behind him. Could he be...falling in love? \nINT: GRU'S BEDROOM - SAME \nRIIIING! Gru's ALARM CLOCK goes off. He reaches out and turns it off. Ready to greet the day. \nINT: SHOWER - DAY \nGru happily washes in the shower, acting out a puppet show with his rubber ducky. \nGRU Quack!     Quack!    Quack! \nINT: BATHROOM - DAY \nGru brushes his teeth with two toothbrushes. He jokingly arranges them in his mouth like walrus tusks, then BARKS like a seal. \nINT: KITCHEN - DAY \nHEART-SHAPED PANCAKES are served to the girls sitting at the table. Edith makes a face at getting hers. \nAGNES Yeah! \nMARGO So I take it the date went well? \nGRU No!   It was horrible! \nHe laughs gleefully.    The girls exchange looks.    What? \nThen he skips out of the room, dancing with a minion in the kitchen. Agnes's face lights up. Yes! DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    68. \nEXT: STREET - DAY \nGru makes his way to work--on foot: \n--he strolls down the sidewalk. \n--he passes a MAILMAN and gives him a high five. \nGRU High-five! \nThen a POLICEMAN, with whom he exchanges mimed gunfire. \nThen a NUN, with whom he bumps rumps. \nGRU (CONT'D) Bump it. \nSeeing something offscreen, Gru GASPS. \n--he stops traffic so a happy family of DUCKS can cross the street. \n--he plays ultimate frisbee with a bunch of COLLEGE KIDS, balancing the spinning disc on his pointy nose. \nGru walks back home, completely depressed. \nWalks past the college kids playing frisbee.      Catches the frisbee and tosses it down the sewer. \nWalks past the group of bucket drummers.    As he passes he KICKS one of the buckets. \nWalks past the old ladies doing Tai Chi. As they balance on one leg he pushes them all and they all fall over. \nEXT: GRU'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's pouring rain.    Gru sits alone outside his house. Miserable. \nAnd then an UMBRELLA approaches him. It looks like it's traveling on its own. But when it gets closer it lifts up, revealing Agnes. \nAGNES I brought you an umbrella. \nGru takes the umbrella and Agnes joins him.    They both huddle under it. \nGRU Ah, thank you. \nAGNES What're you doing out here? \nGRU Remember when you said that I liked Lucy? Well, it turns out...you're right. \nAgnes's face lights up. DESPICABLE ME 2               CINCO & KEN DRAFT   72. \nAGNES Really? \nGRU Yes, but...well, she's moving away. (sadly) I'm never going to see her again. \nAgnes's face falls. All her hopes and dreams shattered.     But she tries to encourage Gru. \nAGNES Is there anything I can do to help? \nGRU Oh, I don't--I don't think so, sweetheart. \nAGNES Well, is there anything you could do? \nGru thinks. \nINT: GRU'S OFFICE - DAY \nGru is on the PHONE. \nGRU \"Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for Australia and all, but...\" (struggles to get it out) Okay, here is the question. \"Would you like to--to go out on a date?\" \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL Dave the minion standing across from Gru, pretending to be on a cell phone on the other end of the line. And wearing a RED-HAIRED WIG. He shrugs. \nDAVE Eh, no. \nGRU Okay, that's not helping. \nHe hangs up. \nGRU (CONT'D) All right.     Here we go.   For real this time. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT      73. \nHe stares at Lucy's card. Then turns to the phone. It's a stand-off. He does stretches and calisthenics to psych himself up. He SIGHS. \nGRU (CONT'D) I can do this. \nHe stares down the phone again. It sits there, taunting him. We cut back and forth between Gru and the phone, until finally-- \nGRU (CONT'D) Agh!    I hate you! \nHe produces a FLAMETHROWER and burns up the phone.    Dave dives out of the way. \nGRU (CONT'D) (satisfied) Ah. \nRIIIIIING !!!    The FIRE ALARM goes off. \nCHOP! Suddenly AXES chop through the wall. Several minions in FIREMEN'S GEAR enter.  Another minion imitates a siren through a bullhorn. \nSIREN MINION Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo! \nOne continues chopping everything in sight with his axe, then chops his way right through the wall of the house and falls outside. Another minion brings in a MASSIVE HOSE, turns it on, and goes flying around the room as it whips around like a snake. Dave tests out a fire extinguisher. \nSIREN MINION (CONT'D) Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo! \nGRU (CONT'D) Edith, try not to kill anyone. \nEDITH Hai! \nGRU Margo-- \nAs Gru turns to Margo he sees that she is holding hands with Antonio, face-to-face, almost close enough to kiss. \nANTONIO Hello, Mr. Gru. \nGru furrows his brow. \nGRU Aghhh!    Okay... \nHe grabs Antonio and drags him far away from Margo. \nMARGO Gru! \nGRU There must be the standard six feet of space between you and boys. (re: Antonio) Especially this boy. \nGru turns and sees that Antonio is back next to Margo. \nANTONIO (laughs) You are a funny man. There are no rules, Se\u00f1or! It's Cinco De Mayo! (to girls) Come on! They're starting the dance! \nHe grabs Margo's hand and takes off.    Edith and Agnes follow. Agnes explodes with delight. \nAGNES (rolling her r like crazy) Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriba! \nGru watches them go.    Frowns. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       77. \nEXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER \nGru, sneaking through the party, spots Antonio and Margo dancing. \nGru sneaks up on Antonio, using the flashing strobe lights to cover his approach. Suddenly Antonio is gone and Gru is the one dancing with Margo, who has her back to him and is oblivious to what's going on. \nAntonio reappears and kicks Gru in the crotch from behind. He dances once again with Margo while Gru hunches over in pain. \nGru then gets the upper hand and starts choking Antonio and shaking him. Margo turns around and sees this. \nGru and Antonio see they are being watched by Margo and start casually dancing next to each other as if nothing is wrong. \nAs the song ends, Margo takes Antonio's hand and pulls him away from Gru off the dance floor. \nGru is defeated and all alone. \nINT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER \nGru sits by himself in the corner, sulking and staring at Lucy's lipstick taser. A WAITER walks by and places a tortilla chip sombrero on his head with the rim filled with guacamole. He breaks off a piece, dips it, and eats it. \nEDUARDO (O.S.) So glad you could make it, mi compadre. \nGru looks up and sees Eduardo standing there.   Gru quickly hides the taser. \nEDUARDO (CONT'D) (sensing something's wrong) Hey, what's wrong? \nGRU Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong. I'm just chilling with the guac...from my chip hat. \nGru takes another scoop of guacamole, smiles, and gives a thumbs up. A glob of guacamole falls from the sombrero. Eduardo puts his arm around him. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   78. \nEDUARDO Gru, please. I know that look all too well. It is the look of a broken heart. \nGRU How did you know? \nEDUARDO Believe me, my friend, I too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole. \nGRU You? \nEL MACHO Yes. But we are survivors. There's much more to us than meets the eye. Enjoy the party. \nEduardo gives Gru a meaningful look. And then walks away. Gru watches him go. Deep in thought. \nGru notices Eduardo suspiciously sneak away from the party and head into the house. \nGru gets up from the table and follows Eduardo. As he walks through the party, several partygoers break tortilla pieces off his sombrero to eat. \nINT: EDUARDO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nLUCY I choose Gru. (to everyone) I CHOOSE GRU! \nLucy runs to the exit door and flings it open.   WOOSH!   Air rushes throughout the cabin. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Thank you, Gru stewardess! \nThe flight attendant stands up, recovering from her twirl. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT You're welcome! \nThe other passengers wave as the plane's oxygen masks fall from each overhead console. And with that, Lucy jumps from the plane, holding her purse. \nEXT: SKY - DAY \nAs Lucy falls from the sky she presses a button on her purse and it transforms into a hanglider. She flies off with purpose. \nINT: TUNNEL - DAY \nElevator doors open revealing EL MACHO'S UNDERGROUND LAIR. Gru stands in the doorway, pulling the dart out of his nose. The lair is a massive villainous complex that looks a lot like hell. Gru takes the place in. It's awesome and terrifying. The magnet ship is there! \nEDUARDO (O.S.) You have not lost your touch, my friend. \nGru turns around and sees Eduardo dressed in El Macho's old wrestling outfit, like we saw in the flashback. \nGRU Ha ha!    I knew it!   You are El Macho! \nEL MACHO That's right! \nGRU Nobody believed me! Ho ho!     But I knew you weren't dead! DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    82. \nEL MACHO (laughing) Of course not. I merely faked my death, ha, ha! (beat) But now it's time for me to make a spectacular return to evil! Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru what we're up to here. \nStanding in the middle of the lair's walkway is the one, the only...Dr. Nefario. \nGRU Dr. Nefario? \nDR. NEFARIO Nice to see you, Gru. \nGRU Whaaat? This-- So, this is your new job opportunity? \nDR. NEFARIO Absolutely. You're gonna like this. \nDr. Nefario pulls a lever. A platform rises with the Purple Minion version of Kevin strapped to a chair on it. \nEL MACHO Sorry--I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause. \nGRU Oh!   Kevin? Agh! \nEL MACHO No, he's not Kevin anymore. Now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine! \nKEVIN Blah! \nEL MACHO Just watch this! \nHe then presses a BUTTON. \n--a machine gun lowers and the purple minion's RIDDLED with BULLETS, but unhurt. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     83. \n--a FLAMETHROWER shoots fire at the purple minion, but he's completely unharmed. \n--an axe is swung at him, but he just eats it. \n--an atom bomb falls on him, but he just swallows it and it explodes harmlessly in his belly. \n--a POLICE CAR is dropped onto him, and he devours it whole. \nGru stares, stunned. \nEL MACHO (CONT'D) And here's the best part! I've got an ARMY OF THEM! \nThe lights come on above El Macho, revealing hundreds of caged PURPLE MINIONS. \nGru can't believe his eyes.    El Macho LAUGHS. \nEL MACHO (CONT'D) Soon I will unleash them on the world--and if anyone, anyone, tries to stop them...YEOW! Their city gets eaten! (beat) We can do it together! \nGRU Together? \nAGNES Whoa! \nIt drops down into the lab and lands on a dazed yellow minion. The girls SCREAM as it jumps up and dashes towards them. \nEvil minion Kevin stomps toward the girls.    They are backed into a corner. It's all over. \nThen suddenly a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE enters frame and injects evil minion Kevin. He falls over, writhing on the floor. Then he sits up and-- \nHas turned back into a YELLOW MINION.    It's Kevin! \nKEVIN Ooh-la-la!     Pilatos? \nAGNES Kevin! \nThe other minions dog pile on him with friendly hugs. \nMARGO Dr. Nefario! You're back! \nReveal Dr. Nefario holding the needle. \nDR. NEFARIO In the flesh. \nNefario produces a VIAL filled with YELLOW LIQUID. \nDR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) Behold, the antidote! \nHe walks over to a vat of the jelly. \nDR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) Come on. Let's finally put this horrible jelly to some good use. \nHe pours the antidote into the vat. \nEXT: EL MACHO'S HOUSE - LATER \nGru makes his way up the road leading to El Macho's house. He is wearing handcuffs, and being led at spear-point by Dave and Stuart, who have been painted purple to look like Evil minions. But they are goofing around and giggling. And they still have a few yellow spots. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   92. \nGRU Hey, guys.     Come on!   Stay focused here! \nThe minions somber up. \nMINIONS Okay, okay. \nGru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple paint. \nThey approach the front gate, which is closed. Dave boosts himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the intercom. He hears Evil Minion gibberish in response. He responds back in Evil Minion gibberish. \nThe intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open. \nThe gate opens and there are DOZENS of PURPLE MINIONS milling about. They eye Gru and his captors suspiciously. \nDave and Stuart poke Gru with a spear. \nGRU (attempting to act) Curses. Foiled again. These guys captured me. \nThe Evil Minions CHEER at seeing this. \nGru, Dave and Stuart have to walk all the way to the house surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions. The painted yellow minions are very nervous. The purple minions eye them as they pass. They GROWL and the yellow minions attempt to GROWL back. \nIt's extremely intense, but it looks like they're going to make it. \nThen one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at one of the painted ones. They get into a raspberry fight until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the slobber off him. It rubs off the purple paint. \nOne of the evil purple minions points and SCREAMS. They're exposed! All of the purple minions run towards Gru, Dave and Stuart. Teeth bared. Ready to chomp. \nGRU (CONT'D) Run! \nThey take off running. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      93. \nEXT: EL MACHO'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nGru and the yellow minions burst into El Macho's backyard. The Evil Minions give chase. \nGRU Up that tree! Hurry, hurry! \nThey climb a tree up to the roof of the house, only to be pursued by more minions up there. And the Evil Minions have devoured the tree so they can't go back that way either. \nWith no escape, Gru and the minions run up a tower until they reach the top--a dead end. \nEl Macho stares down Gru.   Fire in his eyes. \nEL MACHO We could've ruled the world together, Gru. But now--you're gonna die. \nHe pulls out a vial of PX-41 and drinks it. Gru GASPS. El Macho transforms into a giant, purple, furry creature. He ROARS. \nGru pulls the trigger on his jelly gun, but he is out of ammunition. He then pulls out the FREEZE RAY and fires, encasing El Macho's fists in blocks of ice. El Macho GROWLS and slams his fists to the ground, shattering the ice and knocking Gru off the platform and onto a scaffolding. Gru SCREAMS. \nThe scaffolding tips over. El Macho grabs the scaffolding and holds it above his head, ready to crush Gru. \nSuddenly Gru pulls out Lucy's lipstick taser and fires it at Purple El Macho! The jolt of electricity has him shaking and dancing and ultimately sizzling and smoking, until he finally collapses on the ground. \nGRU Lipstick taser! \nLucy smiles at this. \nLUCY Aw...he copied me. \nGru runs off to save her.   The minions surround El Macho, cocking their jelly guns. \nEL MACHO (dazed) I am not afraid of your jelly guns. \nDR. NEFARIO Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine. \nDr. Nefario fires the Fart Gun directly into El Macho's face, causing him to pass out. The minions CHEER, firing their jelly guns into the air. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT     97. \nOne of the minions stands on top of El Macho and poses for a big game hunter-style photo. Dr. Nefario smiles for the camera as well. \nGru runs toward the rocket. \nLUCY Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be fine. I have survived lots worse than this. (beat) Okay, that's not entirely true. I'm actually kind of freaking out up here! \nGRU Don't worry--I will get you out of this! \nGru attempts to untie Lucy. And then sees Pollito has walked over to the remote. Gru and Lucy GASP. The chicken looks at Gru and Lucy, then pecks the button. \nGRU (CONT'D) I really hate that chicken. \nThe rocket blasts off into the air. The Minions and Girls watch in horror as Gru and Lucy fly off on the rocket. \nEXT: SKY - CONTINUOUS \nGru uses his knife to cut Lucy's ropes. They SCREAM as the shark gets loose and falls down to a SUSHI BAR below where all of the CUSTOMERS and SUSHI CHEF CHEER. \nMeanwhile, on the rocket Gru rips a panel off the side, revealing a mess of WIRES inside. \nLUCY Is there a red one?   It's usually the red one. \nGru starts to pull out wires left and right.   To no avail. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Gru, anytime now! \nGru GASPS, realizing they are approaching the VOLCANO. Time is running out. Death is imminent. He looks Lucy in the eyes. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    98. \nGRU Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of this alive, so I need to ask you a question. \nLUCY Uh, better make it quick! \nGRU If I'd asked you out on a date, what would you have said? \nLUCY Are you kidding me?!   Yes! \nGru smiles. Then realizes that the rocket is still careening toward the volcano. He grabs Lucy. \nGRU JUMP!!! \nGru and Lucy grab hands and leap off the rocket. \nThe rocket plunges into the volcano. \nGru and Lucy plummet through the air. \nKA-BLAAAAM!!! The volcano explodes in a massive tempest of fire and smoke and lava. \nThe impact of the blast hits Gru and Lucy and sends them flying. \nSPLASH!

ARCTIC CIRCLE. \nAt the GUARD GATE, two RUSSIAN GUARDS play poker using an overturned barrel as a table. \nRussian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds... and four Aces. The other Guard folds. Russian Guard 1 LAUGHS and drags in the pile of coins. \nWhile he SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN and does a celebratory dance, the coins fly up into the air. Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and sees that the coins are gone. He accuses the other Guard of stealing them. Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them. \nRussian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly, until it flies up into the air. They both look up to see where it's gone. Then the metal barrel they were using as a table flies up, knocking them over. \nRussian Guard 2 looks up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNET SHIP LOWERING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND HOVERING OVER THE LABORATORY. \nA watchtower guard shouts. A door below opens as a bunch of Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship. Then...WOOSH! All of their guns are pulled up towards the ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to their guns. \nA SNOWMOBILE lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet. Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from the ground. \nThen-- \nTHE ENTIRE LAB STARTS TO GET PULLED UP OUT OF THE GROUND. \nCLANK! The lab makes contact with the ship. It flies up and down, shaking the scientists and guards off. They fall to the ground. The magnet ship flies away with their lab, vehicles, and weapons. \nThe remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the snow with the remnants of the damaged base. We see a porta- potty door open. A Confused Guard is sitting on the can reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident.

The yard is decorated with pink balloons and streamers, and a BOUNCY HOUSE shaped like a castle. \nAGNES and several other LITTLE GIRLS slide down a slide. They are all dressed as princesses, but Agnes is dressed as a princess riding a unicorn. \nAGNES This is the best party EVER!!! \nEdith, dressed as a ninja, emerges from beneath a table and climbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts, blades, and boxing gloves come up from the ground underneath her. She jumps down, narrowly avoiding a bear trap. \nEDITH Haha!   Yeah! DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       3. \nTwo LITTLE GIRLS fish in a small kiddie pool.

One Minion wanders off from the fight with his helmet on backwards, wildly swinging his mace. \nAcross the yard, Gru is busy grilling burgers and talking on the phone. Not happy. \nGRU No, no, no! What do you mean she's not coming?! I have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess! \nThe mace-swinging Minion walks by and accidently, repeatedly hits Gru with the mace in the shin. \nGRU (CONT'D) Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it! \nGru kicks the minion's helmet and chases him off with a spatula, sending him towards the party swinging his mace. Gru SIGHS and returns to the call. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   4. \nGRU (CONT'D) Listen! I don't want a refund! I want a fairy princess... please! Please, I am begging you. (Resigned) You know what? I hope that you can sleep at night, you crusher of little girls' dreams!!! \nGru hits the phone with his spatula and hangs up.    Turns and sees Agnes standing there. \nAGNES Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess coming? \nGru stares down at Agnes' big excited eyes. He opens his mouth to tell her the truth, but can't do it. \nGRU Any minute now! \nAgnes squeals with excitement and runs off. \nAGNES Yayyy! \nGru looks worried--what do I do now?    He signals two minions. \nGRU Stall them. \nEXT: BACKYARD - LATER \nA hand-painted piece of cardboard reading \"THE MAGIC SHOW\" is placed on an easel. Agnes and all of the little kids sit in a semicircle on the grass. Two minions dressed as magicians are doing a magic act with Edith as their assistant. One minion blows up a balloon and puts it in Edith's mouth. Then the other whips out a CHAINSAW and fires it up, heading toward her. \nMargo sees this and quickly intervenes. \nMARGO Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright. That's enough of the magic show! \nThe minions don't hide their disappointment. \nMINIONS Awwww. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   5. \nMargo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something. \nMARGO Wait, did you hear that? It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust. \nAGNES (gasps) It's the fairy princess!   She's coming! \nMargo gasps and points up to the sky. \nMARGO Look! \nEdith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it up to reveal-- \nGru. Dressed in a PUFFY PINK DRESS, fairy wings, glittery eyelashes and tiara and magical wand. \nUp on top of Gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him down on a rope. Edith's balloon floats by and distracts them. \nThey let go of the rope and Gru swings wildly, smashing into the wall of the house and crashing to the ground. \nGRU Aaaaaahh! \nHe stands up and tries to cover. \nAgnes SIGHS HAPPILY, in awe of the fairy princess. \nGRU (CONT'D) (in falsetto) It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The most magical fairy princess of all! And I am here to wish Princess Agnes a very happy birthday! \nGru sprinkles the girls with glitter and they continue to stare, frozen. Then a LITTLE GIRL raises her hand and speaks with a lisp. \nLITTLE GIRL How come you're tho fat? \nGru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a high-pitched, dreamy voice.

Sinister plots, large-scale crimes...It's what I live for! I mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly? \nGRU Well, I'm also considering a line of jams... \nDR. NEFARIO Um...the thing is, Gru... (deep breath) I've had an offer of employment elsewhere. \nGRU Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're kidding, right? \nDR. NEFARIO It's a great opportunity for me, bigger lab, more evil, full dental... \nDr. Nefario presses a button and his stuff folds itself up into a traveling suitcase. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     22. \nDr. Nefario hangs his head.    Gru stares back at his old friend. \nGRU Very well. Let us give you the proper send-off. (calls off screen) Minions! \nINT: GRU'S LAB - LATER \nSeven minions are lined up with seven fart guns. Dr. Nefario sits in his scooter. \nGRU The highest honor awarded. To Dr. Nefario for your years of service. The twenty-one fart gun salute! \nFART!   FART!   FART! \nDr. Nefario COUGHS.     His eyes are watering (and not only from the smell). \nDR. NEFARIO Uh, I counted twenty-two. \nDave CHUCKLES, guilty.    Dr. Nefario fires up the scooter. \nDR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) Farewell, my friends. \nThe minions CRY. Dr. Nefario pushes another button on the scooter, transforming it into flying mode. He GUNS the engine and it begins flying away. At the slowest pace possible. Everyone just stands there awkwardly. \nDR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) This may take a while. Go about your business. \nEveryone walks off. \nDR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) I miss you already! \nGru examines Lucy's business card.     Makes a decision. \nEXT: GRU'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe shadow of a mysterious figure approaches Gru's front door. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    23. \nEXT: GRU'S FOYER - NIGHT \nA Minion wears a French Maid's outfit and SINGS as he vacuums the floor. The doorbell rings. \nThe Minion opens the door to see who it is. \nFRENCH MAID MINION Hello? \nA shadow falls across the terrified minion as something unseen abducts him. \nEXT: GRU'S FOYER - LATER \nThe vacuum moves back and forth across the floor by itself. Another Minion walks by wearing a different Maid outfit. He doesn't see the other Minion and closes the door. \nThen he opens it again, cleans the doorknob, and closes it. \nINT: FAMILY ROOM - DAY \nIt's morning at Gru's house. Margo and Agnes sit on the couch with a LAPTOP. Edith leans over the top of the couch, looking on. \nAGNES Are you sure we should be doing this? \nMARGO Yes, it's for his own good. \nOn the screen is a DATING WEBSITE (CREATE-A-DATE.NET)--the girls are creating a profile for Gru. \nMARGO (CONT'D) Okay, we need to choose a picture. \nMargo clicks through pictures of Gru.    Each one is worse than the last. \n", "test2_true": "CLICK. \nAGNES (CONT'D) Scary. \nCLICK. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    24. \nEDITH Weird. \nCLICK. The next picture is of Gru in a bathing suit.   The girls react in horror. \nGIRLS Aaaaaah!!! \nMargo covers Agnes's eyes. \nAGNES What is that?! \nGru enters the family room. \nGRU Good morning, girls! I have an announcement to make. \nMARGO Hey, what celebrity do you look like? \nGRU Ummm...Bruce Willis. \nThe girls stare at him blankly. \nMARGO Mmmm...no. \nAGNES Humpty Dumpty! \nEDITH Ooh, Gollum! \nThe girls LAUGH. \nGRU Okay, what are you doing? \nAGNES We're signing you up for online dating! \nGRU Oh, okay...WHAT?! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. \nGru grabs the laptop away from the girls. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    25. \nEDITH Aw come on, it's fun. \nMARGO And it's time for you to get out there. \nGRU No! Stop!      No one is ever getting out there!     Ever! \nGru hands a Minion the laptop, accidentally hitting him in the face. \nGRU (CONT'D) Okay, now for the announcement:    I have accepted a new job. \nMARGO Whoa--really? \nGRU Yes, I have been recruited by a top secret agency to go undercover and save the world! \nEDITH You're gonna be a spy?! \nGRU That's right, baby! Gru's back in the game! With gadgets and weapons and cool cars...the whole deal. \nEDITH Awesome! \nAgnes looks up at him in awe. \nAGNES Are you really gonna save the world? \nGru looks at Agnes. \nGRU Yes.   Yes I am. \nHe coolly puts on a pair of sunglasses. \nWe pan to Dave mimicking Gru with a pair of sunglasses. \nDAVE Mocha! DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   26. \nAnd then to Kevin dressed in an Amish beard and tie. \n", "test3_input": "She makes it through, but still no sign of Gru. \nSuddenly Pollito appears and exchanges looks with Lucy. He SCREECHES and flies towards her. She strikes a martial arts pose ready to defend herself. As she does, her purse falls to the ground. \nThe attack never comes and she looks down to see Pollito pecking at her purse. \nEL MACHO (O.S.) Pollito!   What's the matter? \nEl Macho appears and picks up the chicken, petting it. \nLUCY Oh, hey!   Eduardo! \nEL MACHO Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's usually not like this. The same thing happened the other day with... with Gru and... \nEl Macho drops off, deep in thought.   Connecting the dots. Lucy is oblivious. \nLUCY Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you seen him? I really need to talk to him. \nEL MACHO Yes, I think he's somewhere around here. You two are close, no? \nLUCY Oh, I don't know. I mean close... I wouldn't say we were close. Why, did he say we were close? Did he say that? DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT      87. \nEL MACHO It's more what he didn't say. For instance, he never mentioned...that you were both working for the Anti- Villain League!!! \nSuddenly El Macho turns Pollito around revealing that he has her AVL credentials in his beak. El Macho grabs Lucy. \nEL MACHO (CONT'D) (threateningly) You're coming with me. \nHe leads her away. \nLUCY Hey! \nWe see Dr. Nefario watching this, in shock.      He's holding a drink and a Mexican flag cupcake. \nDR. NEFARIO Crikey. \nEXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe vehicle pulls into the driveway. \nINT: GRU'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nGru walks the girls into the family room. Two minions sit in front of the big screen TV playing a video game. \nEDITH So Eduardo's actually El Macho? Cool! \nGRU No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along, so if anyone's cool, it's me. \nThe BIGSCREEN TV BEEPS. Gru and the others turn to look. It's Dr. Nefario. He's at El Macho's, whispering and looking anxiously around him from under a table. \nDR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN) (whispering) Gru! \nGRU Well, Dr. Nefario... DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    88. \nDR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN) (hurriedly) El Macho's on to you. He knows you're working for the AVL. And he's got your partner! \nGru is confused. \nGRU Lucy? Wha--that's impossible! She's on her way to Australia... \nEL MACHO (O.S.) Nefario! \nDr. Nefario looks nervously offscreen.    El Macho's coming. \nDR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN) Sorry, gotta go! \nNefario disconnects the camera.   The screen goes blank. \nAgnes GASPS and turns to Gru. \nAGNES He's got Lucy? \nGRU (determined) Not for long. \nGru begins to walk out of the room.    He turns to the minions. \nGRU (CONT'D) Come on. (beat) We're getting her out of there. \n", "test3_true": "The minions are visibly disappointed to leave their video game. One of them clutches the controller in his hand and continues to play until the moment he exits the frame. \nINT: GRU'S GARAGE - DAY \nGru gets on his motorcycle. It's the GRUCYCLE, a Gru-style motorcycle, like Arnold in Terminator 2. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    89. \nEXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY \nA playhouse in Gru's front yard drops away, revealing a hatch in the ground. Out drives Gru. Two minions sit behind him holding on. \nHe speeds down the road.    Ready to kick some butt. \nEXT: EL MACHO'S COMPOUND - DAY \nThe yard is now filled with ROCKET SHIPS. \nFrom behind, we watch El Macho emerge from his home to survey the troops. \nSome minions file into the rocket ships.    El Macho watches them and LAUGHS maniacally. \nEXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY \nEVIL MINION POV: The evil minion Kevin runs down the street, nearing Gru's house. He is scared by his own reflection in a shiny parked car. He spots a tricycle and eats it. \nThen Kyle spots him and GROWLS. \nKyle runs off and evil minion Kevin gives chase.   He stops when he sees the front door. \nINT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY \nMargo and Agnes sit on the floor playing a princess board game. Next to Agnes is her unicorn. \nThey hear a SCRATCHING SOUND outside the window.   Agnes looks scared. \nAGNES What was that? \nMargo stands up. Makes her way toward the window, which is covered with drapes. Then reaches a nervous hand and pulls back the drapes. \nMARGO I don't see anything. \nSuddenly, evil minion Kevin appears at the window, looking really scary! \nMargo SCREAMS. DESPICABLE ME 2                CINCO & KEN DRAFT   90. \nSMASH! Evil minion Kevin crashes through the window and lands in the family room surrounded by shattered glass and tangled up in the curtain. He turns to the girls, who slowly back away. He looks at Agnes and ROARS. \nMARGO (CONT'D) Run! \nMargo grabs Agnes and they run out of the room, accidentally dropping the stuffed unicorn behind. \nAgnes stops and runs back for it. \nAGNES My unicorn! \nMARGO Agnes, no! \nAgnes stops and sees evil minion Kevin already has it in his mouth. \nAgnes screams a crazy HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM. It SHATTERS all the glass in the room, including the glass in evil minion Kevin's goggles. He spits out the unicorn. He is slowed him down for a bit, so Agnes safely grabs the unicorn, and Margo grabs Agnes's hand. \nThey run for the elevator to the lower level, with the purple minion hot on their tails.

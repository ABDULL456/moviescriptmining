You're the best fairy princess ever! \nGru smiles. \nGRU (in falsetto) You are welcome, little girl. \nShe runs off, but quickly returns. \nAGNES (whispers in his ear) I know it's really you, Gru. I'm just pretending for the other kids. \nShe runs off again to join her friends. Gru watches her go. Couldn't be happier. Then he is approached by JILLIAN, a heavily-Botoxed mom. \nJILLIAN Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the Party! \nGRU (forcing a smile) Hello, Jillian. \nJILLIAN Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and...

The table collapses to the ground beneath her. \nGRU (realizes what's going on) No, no, no, get off of the limb right now. No limb. \nJILLIAN Oh, come on...she's a riot. She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her... \nIn the background, Natalie inadvertently walks in front of a bottle pitch game, is struck by a ball, and falls to the ground. \nGRU No, Jill's, that is not happening. Seriously. I'm fine. \nJILLIAN (calling after Gru) Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How about my cousin Linda? \nGru walks off, passing by Edith and Margo. \nGRU No. \nJILLIAN Oh, oh!

A WALL OF ICE heads for Lucy. \nBut before it gets to her, Lucy pulls out a retractable gun from her purse, which acts as a FLAMETHROWER. Melting the ice. \nLUCY You know you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru. For example-- \nShe pulls out a LIPSTICK. Fires it at Gru. The tip flies through the air and connects with his chest, latching on. ZZZZZAPPP! It tases him, which sends his body flailing in different funny poses before passing out. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so good. \nEXT: STREET - LATER \nLucy tries to drag Gru to her car, but he's too heavy. \nLUCY Man.    Ugh.     Large...person. \nShe gets an idea. \nLucy gets into her car. In the background, we see Gru begin to come to, but he is struck by Lucy's car as she pulls back and is knocked out again. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Oh...sorry! \nCloser now, Lucy gets out and stuffs his body into the trunk. \nJust then Tom and Stuart come out of Gru's garage and see their boss being loaded in. Lucy struggles to close the trunk. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Get...in...there...you...big...man! \nSLAM! Lucy finally slams the trunk then quickly gets into the vehicle. \nTom and Stuart exchange horrified looks. \nTOM AND STUART Boss!

Koom ey lah! \nStuart leaps for the bumper and Tom catches him by his overall straps. Tom holds on tight as Stuart dangles from the back of the car, his overall straps stretching way out. \nSTUART (CONT'D) Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah! \nAs Lucy turns a corner, he slams into some garbage cans and ends up skiing behind the car in a cardboard box. \nNow in the box, Stuart continues to ride behind the car, and even starts to get the hang of that, too. He waves at Tom, and Tom waves back. \nSTUART (CONT'D) Woooo! \nTOM Ooooh! \nAll is good until they go past a clothesline and a sheet gets stuck on Stuart. \nThe sheet forms a parasail which lifts Stuart up into the air. He strikes a Superman flying pose. Then a flock of GEESE fly toward him and one actually slams into his face. \nSTUART Quack quack! \nIt SQUAWKS at him as it flies off. \nLucy spots the commotion in her side view mirror and slams on the brakes.

Stuart gets his dress caught in the escalator. It comes off and he hides in a nearby potted plant. \nGru glances at a store called the \"EAGLE HAIR CLUB.\" He then arrives at a charming, pink CUPCAKE STORE. The sign reads, \"BAKE MY DAY\" Gru frowns and takes off his sunglasses. \nGRU Hm.     \"Bake My Day.\"   Blech. \nINT: BAKE MY DAY - CONTINUOUS \nGru unlocks the door and enters. JINGLE! BELLS on the door ring. The inside is sugary and clean and quaint. Gru takes it all in. Then turns to the minions. \nGRU Alright, here is the cupcake recipe I got off the internet. \nThe minions excitedly grab the recipe and head for the kitchen. Gru kicks Stuart, who is still staggering around in the potted plant. \nGRU (CONT'D) And don't go nuts with the sprinkles! \nGru is left alone. He looks around. Sees a BUNNY CUPCAKE in a glass cake dish. Then a SHARK CUPCAKE in the next cake dish. And in the next dish he sees Lucy's head. She makes a funny face.

Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay- ay-ay-ay! \nShe successfully eliminates all of the cupcakes, then turns to Gru, out of breath. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Whoo. Wasn't expecting that. (strikes a martial arts pose) Or was I? \nGru has a cupcake stuck to the top of his head, frosting side down. Lucy gestures as if he's got a little food on his face. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Ooh... you got... You got... a little... \nThe cupcake slowly slides down, then falls to the floor.    It leaves a long smear on Gru's face. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Here, I'll-- I'll get it. \nGru stands frozen as she tries to clean him up. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Oh, that's just spreading...um... \nGRU Alright, alright.

It's a combination of Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare, and krumping. \nGRU Okay, that's weird--why are you here? \nLUCY On assignment from Silas.   I'm your new partner. Yay! \nGRU What?! No, no \"yay.\" Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner. \nLUCY Well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you. But not me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway. \nGru is about to respond when Dave the minion comes out the kitchen door. He carries a cupcake in the shape of a Minion. \nDAVE Walla! \nImmediately Lucy moves with lightning-quick reflexes. She smashes his cupcake, flips him into the air, and pins him to the counter.

They toast each other with champagne. Dave drinks from the bottle. \nEXT: BRIDGE - NIGHT - FANTASY \nLucy and Dave sit on the railing of a moonlit footbridge.

Dave... \nINT: BAKE MY DAY - DAY \nBack to reality, where Dave is staring up at Lucy, lovestruck. \nGRU Earth to Dave!     You can leave now. \nDave goes back into the kitchen, never taking his eyes off of Lucy. \nINT: MALL - DAY \nCLOSE ON the Giant Cupcake on top of the cupcake shop. The CHERRY on the Giant Cupcake rotates, revealing a CAMERA hidden inside. VZZZZZT! The lens zooms. \nGRU (O.S.) Now, what do we got? Who's on the list? Fire `em at me. \nINT: BAKE MY DAY - SAME \nGru and Lucy stand next to each other under a domed lamp lowered from the ceiling.

CHUCK KINNEY, a small perky man, holds up an empty teddy bear skin for a little boy. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Chuck Kinney, owner of \"Stuff-A- Bear.\" \nKinney shoves the teddy bear's butt onto a sharp metal tube. The bear inflates until it EXPLODES into a torrent of bear skin and stuffing. The little boy CRIES. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Ooh. \nGRU I don't think so. \nDING-A-LING-A-LING! The bell rings on the cupcake shop's front door, signaling a customer. \nEDUARDO (O.S.) Hello? \nGRU Oh! \nGru and Lucy quickly hide their equipment, look up and see EDUARDO PEREZ at the door.

I get it! \nINT: EAGLE HAIR CLUB - SAME \nGru fumbles with the automatic door, then enters Eagle Hair Club. \nFLOYD (O.S.) (chuckles) Welcome to Eagle Hair Club. \nAt the reception desk, a large chair shaped like an eagle spins around. Sitting in the chair is Floyd, looking sinister and petting a FURRY OBJECT that looks like a cat. \nFLOYD (CONT'D) It's about time you showed up...Mr. Gru. \nHis pet BALD EAGLE perched next to him SQUAWKS. \nGRU You...know my name? \nFLOYD (chuckles) When someone moves into the mall who is follically challenged, I make it my business to know all about them. You are bald. And that is bad. \nHe strokes the furry object. Kisses it.    Then places it on a MANNEQUIN HEAD. It's a TOUPEE. \nFLOYD (CONT'D) There you go, my sweet. \nINT: BAKE MY DAY - SAME \nLucy monitors the chem-tracking device from inside the shop. \nLUCY I'm getting nothing so far.

What is it? \nGru thrusts his hips at the painting.    Floyd watches him, suspicious. \nFLOYD I take it you're an art lover? \nLUCY (IN HEADPHONES) No serum. \nGRU Yeah, not so much. \nHe walks over to a podium with a TROPHY.

Focus! \nLUCY (in headphones) Gru? \nFLOYD I promise that this wig will transform you from ugly to irresistible. \nGru stares at the wig.

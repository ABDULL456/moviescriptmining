REACTION: STEPHEN, devastated. Frozen. People walk past him and he doesn't move, doesn't react. 
INT. BATHROOM, TRINITY HALL - DAY 
WATER drips in SLOW MO from an old TAP. 
STEPHEN lies in a bath, in a TRANCE, knees drawn up, hair wet, not moving, in a STATE OF SHOCK, as he stares at the DRIPPING TAP, until - 
- his eyes are drawn to his ARM where he sees a weird PHENOMENON - it's called FASCICULATION - a visible throbbing that travels underneath the skin. 
INT. COLLEGE STAIR-WELL - DAY 
BRIAN rushes up the SPIRAL STAIRS, past the "BEDDER" - a woman who looks after the STUDENTS domestic needs. 
BRIAN (TO BEDDER) Is he up yet? THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   29 
INT. STEPHEN'S DORM ROOM/CAMBRIDGE UNI   - DAY (EM60'S) 
Suddenly, a pounding on his door, and then BRIAN enters STEPHEN's room. 
WAGNER is playing INCREDIBLY LOUDLY on an old TAPE-DECK. BRIAN shuts it off and looks at - 
- STEPHEN, in the corner, in his pyjamas, his MATRESS now on the floor (rather than on the HIGH BUNK as before) legs drawn up, reading a book of CHESS. 
BRIAN "Welcome--to this week's episode of The Natural World, where we explain the extraordinary hibernation patterns of the rare Cambridge Physicist--seen here in his wonderful plumage..." 
Silence. BRIAN waits for STEPHEN to speak. 
BRIAN (CONT'D) So? What did they say? Your wrist. What did they say? 
STEPHEN I have a disease, Bri. 
BRIAN (WHISPERS) Is it--venereal, Stephen? 
STEPHEN No. Motor neuron disease. Lou Gehrig's Disease. He was a baseball player. 
BRIAN Motor what? Sorry, I'm lagging behind in my pioneering work on rare automotive and baseball diseases. Come on, let's go to the pub. 
BRIAN tries to pull STEPHEN to his feet. 
STEPHEN (IMPASSIVELY) I have two years to live. (PAUSE) Sounds strange, doesn't it, when you say it out loud. 
BRIAN What? I--I don't understand. It's not possible! It's ridiculous! (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   30 
CONTINUED: BRIAN (CONT'D) You were fine a couple of days ago. (SILENCE) Steve? You're fine. What did they say...? 
STEPHEN Will you leave me Brian? 
BRIAN I'm sorry, look, I was just being a berk...I'm so... 
The BEDDER knocks and enters. 
BEDDER Stephen! Phone for you! It's a girl. 
BRIAN has no choice. He is badly shaken by the news. 
BRIAN Right. OK. So--see you soon, yeah? 
STEPHEN does his best to smile. Brian exits. 
BEDDER (TO STEPHEN) She's waiting. 
INT. HALLWAY, WILDE FAMILY HOME - DAY

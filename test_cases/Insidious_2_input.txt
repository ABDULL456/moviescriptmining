He realizes he knows where he is. He is in his OLD HOUSE. An alternate world version of it. 
The lighting is different - it's darker. There are no signs of life. Water drips somewhere. 
Josh stumbles forward, seeing an open door. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS 
Josh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room. 
There are THREE PEOPLE in here - a middle aged woman, a middle aged man and a young girl. They are all FROZEN, standing in place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life. 
The woman is in the middle of ironing. The man is sitting in an arm chair reading a newspaper. The girl is lying on the floor. 
The whole scene looks like a macabre `Leave It To Beaver' tableau - a cheerful family frozen in time. 
Josh steps closer to the mother... 
...hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her BLINK. Her body moves slightly. She is not frozen - merely playing statues. Like a street performer keeping as still as possible. 
Josh turns to the father. He is the same. His hand shakes, struggling to hold the newspaper in place. 
He backs away from them, truly creeped out. His back hits a window and he turns, peering through the glass down at the street below. 
A figure, hidden in silhouette, is gazing up at him. 
INT. KITCHEN, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS 
Josh stalks into a kitchen off the living room. A weathered door is adjacent to the kitchen. 
The door is ajar. 
Through it, Josh can see somebodies leg. 
Josh approaches the door, prodding it open gently with his finger. 
It is a bedroom. A tattered cot sits against the wall. A YOUNG MAN (17) sits on the cot, holding a rifle. Like the others, he is trying to be completely still, as if on pause. 
He is having more trouble than the family, trembling slightly. 
JOSH I'm looking for my son, Dalton. 
The boy does not look up. Does not move. 
Josh retreats, scanning the kitchen. There are soiled pots in the sink. Rotting food, but no bugs. Josh turns the faucet but no water comes forth. 
When he turns back, the YOUNG MAN is gone. No longer in his bedroom. 
Josh glances back at the living room. 
The Young Man is now standing inside the living room. 
Again, he is frozen. Holding his rifle. Looking down at his family, who are now splayed out on the carpet, soaked in BLOOD. 
Each of them has a bullet hole in their head. 
Repulsed, Josh tip-toes past them. He looks down at the mother - a bullet wound in the center of her chest. 
She blinks...still playing dead. 
INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS 
More corridors disappearing into darkness. 
Josh wrenches his hair in frustration. He boils over, screaming at the top of his lungs. 
JOSH DALTON!!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!! 
His cry recedes into nothingness. 
DALTON (O.S.) Dad.... 
He heard that. Excited, he spins around, trying to determine where it came from. 
As he does, he sees that the entire dead family is now gathered at the door to the living room. Watching him. 
He summons all his strength and starts running, backing away from them. 
He drives himself to move faster and faster. 
JOSH DALTON! 
DALTON (O.S.) Dad...help me... 
JOSH DALTON!! 
A figure suddenly appears at the end of the hallway.

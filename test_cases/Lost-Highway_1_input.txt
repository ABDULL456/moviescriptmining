Pete opens his door and peers out. 
Pete's POV down the hall toward the living room - his mother and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty smiles in his direction.  They are smoking a joint, passing it back and forth.  They are not looking directly at him. They seem to be looking, but not seeing. 
Pete's parents POV down the hall toward Pete's room.  There is no one there - just an empty hallway. 
Pete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward each other - they start to laugh quietly again. 
Pete's Pov - the hallway and the living room - there is no one in the living room. It's empty.

CUT TO: 
EXT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ed is behind the wheel.  Al is in the passenger seat.  Ed is looking at the Dayton house.  Al's head is bent, looking down.  At first we hear nothing, then the sound of Al's piss streaming into an empty coffee cup.  The camera stays on the top of Al's head until he has completed the last few spurts of his micturition.  Al's head comes up and he opens the passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street.  He closes the door and zips up his trousers.

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 
Pete drives through the night - up Ventura Boulevard with the "Cruisers".  He looks in the other cars and looks at the GIRLS on the street. 
He drives past "Tops", but doesn't see anyone he knows. 
He turns off the boulevard and drives through San Fernando valley neighborhood streets. 
He pulls up in front of Sheila's house and honks his horn. 
He lights a cigarette while he waits. 
In a few minutes Sheila comes out and leans in the passenger side window. 
SHEILA What do you want? 
PETE Nothin'... You want to go for a drive? 
SHEILA I don't know. 
PETE Come on... get in. 
Sheila hesitates for a moment, then gets in. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 
Pete and Sheila drive along dark streets. 
PETE Come here. 
Sheila slides across and sits close to Pete.  Pete puts his arm around her.  She takes a drag from his cigarette and puts her head on his shoulder. 
Pete pulls over into a dark shadow under a tree and stops the car. 
He cuts the engine, turns to Sheila and kisses her.  She breaks away. 
SHEILA Why don't you like me? 
PETE I do like you, Sheila. 
Sheila puts her lips up' close to his and whispers. 
SHEILA How much? 
Pete kisses her and she kisses him back.  They start to feel each other and Sheila takes off her tight sweater.  She's wearing no bra and Pete begins to feel her breasts while she unbuttons his shirt.  They continue to kiss hard throughout. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

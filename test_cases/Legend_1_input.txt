Lili swings the greatsword high over head. 
CHORUS OF GUARDS (chanting): Blood and fire....eternal ice! Blood and fire....and sacrafice.... 
Gump draws back the arrow in the longbow, aiming at Lili. 
JACK: No....! Don't...! 
Jack grabs the bow. He and Gump struggle for the weapon.

120A INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 
The beam of LIGHT hits the plate held by the Second Cook in the fireplace. It STREAKS across the the plate leaning on the bellows, ZIGZAGGING out into the corridor. 
120B INTERIOR KEEP DAY 
The beam of LIGHT ZOOMS out of the corridor, strikes the plate on the viaduct, and REFLECTS down into the lowest depths of the castle. 
121 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 
Gump is determined to shoot Lili. Jack, equally determined to stop him. 
JACK: I trust her, Gump....I'll always trust her.... 
GUMP: Foolish, mortal! 
The beam of LIGHT STREAMS in through the corridor. Blunder REFLECTS it off his plate towards the others. 
Struggling for the bow, Jack and Gump kick over the propped shielf the moment the LIGHT beam reaches it. 
BROWN TOM: Stop lads....! The light! 
A wild LAUGH bursts from Lili's throat. She swings the sword with all her might. 
The blade arcs through the air, a glittering SUNBURST where it carves through the deflected beam of LIGHT. 
Lili aims not for the mare, but for the line restraning her. The sword severs the woven cable. 
LILI (exultant): Run! You're free....! 
The unicorn plunges into the shadows. Only the ECHO of her hoofbeats remain. 
Jack and Gump stop struggling. Jack dives for his fallen shield. 
Darkness pulls a weapon from his belt. It is the stallion's alicorn mounted as a shortsword. 
DARKNESS (sneering savagely): Innocence! 
Huge and terrible, Darkness lunges for Lili, driving the alicorn straight through her side. 
Lili is pierced by the horn. She GASPS, supported by the Demon's hold on the blade. 
Miraculously, Lili's features alter and TRANSFORM. The fangs and claws disappear. Her fur melts like the morning dew. She is an innocent maiden once more. 
Lili slides dying off the alicorn and falls to the ground. 
Jack holds his shield in the beam of LIGHT, angling in a bright swath towards Darkness. 
JACK: Burn....! You evil bastard.... 
The LIGHT hits Darkness like an express train. He HOWLS, blasted in a smoking whirlwind across the dungeon. 
Darkness cowers on his knees, SCREAMING in the LIGHT. 
All the goblins scatter HOWLING from the LIGHT. 
Brown Tom capers a happy two-step around Gump, who stares straight up into the central keep. 
BROWN TOM: ....and we'll dance on the black devil's grave.... 
GUMP'S POV : LOOKING UP: The beam of LIGHT dims and goes out. 
BROWN TOM (OS): What's wrong....? What's happening, Gump? 
Gump shrugs, looking sadly at Jack and the darkened shield he holds. 
GUMP (sadly): Sunset.... 
With a savage SNARL, Darkness staggers off into the gloon, trailing trendrils of smoke. 
Jack drops the shield and rushes to Lili's side. He kneels and cradles her in his arms. 
Throwing back his head, Jack HOWLS like a wild animal. His CRY is a wolf-wail of utter despair. 
Gump runs frantically up to grieving Green Man. 
GUMP: No, Jack....Quick! He's after the mare! 
Gump seizes the grotesque sacraficial greatsword. 
GUMP (cont): The world needs a champion! (handing Jack the black sword) Use this against him! 
Jack snatches the sword. He rises cold with fury and runs off into pursuit of Darkness.

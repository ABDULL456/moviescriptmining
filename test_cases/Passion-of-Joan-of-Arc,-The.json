{"test1_input": "Then the notary places a document in front of Joan and offers her a pen. Joan looks in amazement at the document, which she recognizes: it is the same declaration which was placed in front of her for her to sign during the torture scene. Her look of astonishment shifts from the notary to the document and from the latter to Cauchon. \n112   She explains once more that all the accusations in the document are what God has commanded her to do. She cannot recant like this without denying her God. Cauchon bends over her and says: \nThe Sacrament ... is it not a great blessing? \nJoan nods, and her expression seems to want to say: of course, everybody knows that the Church has no greater treasure. \nCauchon continues: \n... But you will never share in the Church's blessings, if you do not expiate your sins. \n113   He indicates to Joan that she must sign. One of the judges approaches with a wafer. An expression of misery and pain lies on Joan's face as she sits there, sick, feverish and racked with doubts. On one side she sees the wafer, which is more precious to her than life itself, on the other side the document, which will make her confess that she is an agent of the Devil. \n114   As if talking to herself and her conscience, she says: \nI am a good Christian ... \nAs she sits there, alone with all these men, she is the picture of utter despair and loneliness. They all gaze at her with fixed stares. Nobody speaks to her. Finally Cauchon breaks the silence. In a quiet voice he advises Joan to sign and save her soul; but Joan has now mastered her temptation. She hands back the paper. Her body is broken. But the strength of her spirit is unaltered. \nFor a moment they are all struck dumb. \n115   Cauchon gestures, ordering the Sacrament to be carried out. The tears run down Joan's cheeks, when she sees the priests going out with the sacred vessel. \nI love God ... I love Him with all my heart! \nshe says. \n116   Loiseleur, who has accompanied the procession into the adjoining room, tells Warwick the outcome. \n", "test1_true": "118   Jean d'Estivet reproaches her harshly for allowing her vanity to take precedence over the salvation of her soul. He concludes with these words: \nIf you die in this hour, you die as an infidel... \nJoan, goaded by the mental torture to which she has been subjected, answers in words conjured up by her sancta simplicitas; but Jean d'Estivet, revelling in the pain his speech has given Joan, obliterates her with the wounding words, which sting like the lash of a whip: \nYour soul is doomed to perdition \nTo which one of the others adds: \n... to everlasting torture in the flames of Hell! \n119   Groaning under the burden of the injustice and malice they are heaping on her, Joan turns for comfort to Cauchon, whose hand she has just pressed to her cheek; but Cauchon has no comfort to give. He draws back and says coldly: \nJoan, you are a child of the Devil! \n120   She looks at him in unaffected terror. Then it is as if a veil gradually falls from her eyes; as if the whole truth is revealed to her in a flash of lightning. They have lied to her in order to trap her. In her overwrought and exhausted condition she loses all self-control. Fever and ecstasy take charge of her features. As a stream of reproaches pours from her lips they all gaze at her in terror: is this the last flare-up before death, is it madness? All of them feel themselves face to face with something unfamiliar and extraordinary. Slowly they draw away. Cauchon rises and backs round his chair. \n121   Foaming at the mouth, Joan continues to pour out a torrent of words: \nYou say that I am a child of the Devil... \nand she continues: \n... but I say it is you who have been sent by the Devil to torment me! \nShe stands up in bed, pointing at each judge in turn. \nA violent storm of anger breaks out: \n", "test1_id": 2589, "test2_input": "The preceding prison scenes alternate with short shots of this folklife: dancing bears - acrobats - jugglers - a musician - a hobby-horse - a dance-leader - a man with a stick over his shoulder and a cask hanging from the stick - penny in the bucket - another musician who has fastened together a drum and a flute, which he holds in the left hand, with the drum-stick in his right. A wild dance - a man selling birds - dwarfs - contortionists. \nThe following prison scene is interrupted by glimpses of the preparations round the bonfire which is to be lit in the castle yard: a man carrying firewood to the stake, a broken carriage-wheel in the fuel, etc. \n158   The jailer now finds Cauchon in conversation with Warwick at the entrance to the chapel. The jailer explains briefly what has happened in the prison. Warwick and Cauchon exchange eloquent glances. At the same moment Loiseleur comes out from the chapel. In a few words Cauchon puts him in the picture and tells him to assemble some of the judges and notaries. \n159   Meanwhile Joan sits waiting impatiently in her prison. It is evident that she does not make a sacrifice such as hers without doing her nature an injury. She is racked by deep despair and her nerves show it. She shivers; her teeth chatter. She wrings her hands so that her knuckles are completely white. \n160   Finally Cauchon enters, followed by various judges and notaries. They find the young girl dissolved in tears, her face contorted. It is a poor, helpless girl of twenty whom they have defeated. \nDuring the following scene Cauchon exudes an air of benevolence and satisfaction. In contrast with his earlier demeanor he is now calm and equable. His feelings are pleasurable, but it is not a malicious pleasure; he is sure of his prey! \nThey sit down, and Cauchon asks Joan why she has sent for them. With a sob, but also with an expression of determination, she answers: \nI have committed a great sin ... \nShe has to break off, choked by tears. \n161   The judges comfort her and try to alleviate her grief, so that she can continue: \n... I have denied God in order to save my life. \nThe judges look at one another. Not one of them is so hard- hearted as to be untouched by the young woman's genuine distress. \n162   Even Cauchon is moved. It is a moment before he speaks. Then he says: \nSo you still believe that you are sent by God? \nJoan nods in confirmation. \n", "test2_true": "But, Joan, you have admitted in front of everybody that you were misled by the Devil. \nJoan, who has gradually regained her self-control, does not answer immediately. It is only when the judges press her that she replies: \nEverything I said was for fear of the stake! \nCauchon holds a whispered consultation with the others, but it is clear that they all regard it as wasted effort to continue. Cauchon says: \nHave you anything else to tell us? \nJoan shakes her head. The judges rise to go. When Cauchon goes into the adjoining room his eye falls on Warwick, who has just come up the stairs and now gives Cauchon a look of enquiry. Cauchon merely says: \nIt is all over! \nWarwick receives the news with no indication of surprise. \nMeanwhile the judges have started to go down the stairs, when Cauchon holds the last two back. They are Ladvenu and Massieu. Cauchon drops his voice and gives them an order. \n164   The two monks go into the cell, where they find Joan sitting with her hands in her lap. She is now calm and decided. What is she thinking about? About her home in Domr\u00e9my - or about death? Massieu and Ladvenu remain standing by the door. Joan does not see them, so preoccupied is she with her own thoughts. They approach with cautious steps, as people do involuntarily in the house of death. Ladvenu calls to her. She looks up, surprised to see him. Then Ladvenu says: \nJoan, I have come to prepare you for death! \nFor a moment silence reigns, so deep that Joan's breathing can be heard. Then she says in a barely audible voice: \nNow ... already? \nLadvenu, struggling with the tears which are muffling his voice, answers yes. Another long, long silence. Then Joan asks, almost as if fearing the answer: \nWhat kind of death? \n", "test2_id": 2590, "test3_input": "Further away there is a platform for the judges and the English nobility; another is reserved for the preacher and for spectators. \n176   When Joan has taken her place at the stake one of the judges, Nicolas Midi, stands and begins his sermon: \nIn the name of the Lord, amen! \n177   For Joan it is as if his voice has reached her from far away. She weeps incessantly, as she watches the executioner's final preparations; she sees him bending over \n178   His coal-bucket; later she sees him, with a knife in his mouth, uncoiling the rope which is to fasten her to the stake. \n179   Nicolas Midi continues his sermon: \n... Like a rotten member we cut you off from the body of the Church. \nThe preacher turns to face Joan directly; she listens attentively and gives an unconscious nod. At the same moment she sees a flock of doves taking off and flying into the heavens. Then Nicolas Midi ends his short address: \nJoan, go forth in peace ... the Church is unable to protect you! \nJoan, who retains to the end her respect for the Church's servants, inclines politely and gratefully in his direction. \n180   In a loud voice she prays: \nDear God, I accept my death willingly and gladly ... \nHer face becomes more serious and more anguished; she continues: \n... but I entreat Thee, if Thou lovest me, that my suffering may be short ... \n181   Her lament, mild but strongly spoken, rings through the hushed square. Everyone holds his breath to hear the condemned Joan's last words; every eye turns towards her and watches for her smallest movement. They are deeply affected by the simplicity she shows, face to face with death. Many are in tears, even some of the English soldiers. \n", "test3_true": "Where will I be tonight? \nLadvenu exhorts her to have faith in God: with the help of the Almighty she will attain her place in Paradise. The English soldiers grow impatient, and one of their officers approaches the platform and says: \nLook here, priest, are you going to be all day? \n183   Ladvenu insists on his right to prepare the young woman for death. And he says to Massieu, who is bringing him a small missal: \nJoan wishes to have a cross with her when she dies! \n184   Ladvenu instructs Massieu to fetch one from the chapel, and with the little missal in his hand he reads the prayers for those under sentence of death. \nOne of the English soldiers has heard Ladvenu's words to Massieu. He extracts two bits of wood from a faggot lying ready for the bonfire, and joins them so that they form a modest little cross. \n185   Joan, who has followed his movements, is touched. She takes the cross lovingly and reverently, and covers it with kisses. \n186   The English captain is now losing patience, and orders the executioner to do his duty. \n187   Massieu returns with the processional cross. He shows it to Joan; she is inexpressibly happy as she takes it with both hands, kisses it with tears in her eyes, and addresses ardent prayers to it. \n188   Now her eye falls on the executioner, who has climbed up on the other side of her in order to tie her to the stake. He drops the rope; she picks it up. She is bound brutally to the stake. \nLadvenu remains standing. During Joan's prayer he remains holding the crucifix in front of her, so that throughout she can see her Savior. When the executioner has secured Joan he descends. Ladvenu continues to speak words of comfort to Joan. \nAll around her are now in tears. Loiseleur weeps. Even Cauchon weeps. The executioner has made his final preparations. \n189   In his hand he holds the flaming torch which is to set the bonfire alight. \n190   Joan suddenly catches sight of the fire, but her first thought is not for herself: she thinks only of Ladvenu, who seems to have forgotten the danger he is exposed to. She shouts to him: \n", "test3_id": 2591}

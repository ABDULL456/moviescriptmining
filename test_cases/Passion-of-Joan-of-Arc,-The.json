{"train": "THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC \nWritten by \nCarl Theodor Dreyer & Joseph Delteil \nTranslated by \nOliver Stallybrass \nAt the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris it is possible to see one of the most famous documents in the history of the world - the official record of the trial of Joan of Arc. \nThe Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale's original record of the trial of Joan of Arc is shown on the screen. An invisible hand turns over the manuscript pages. \n... If you turn over the pages, yellow with age, which contain the account of her martyrdom ... \nPage after page is shown of this unique document with its lines as straight as arrows, its marginal annotations, and the na\u00efve miniature drawings for which the notaries have found time and space. \n... you will find Joan herself ... not the military genius who inflicted on the enemy defeat after defeat, but a simple and natural young girl ... who died for her country. \nThe last pages are turned. Then the picture disappears and gives way to the first scene of the film, which shows \n1   The prison, where Joan is sitting, praying. The flagstones, the floor in Joan's cell. We see two straws and a hand, Joan's hand, which lays the straws on the floor in the form of a cross. \n2   Scenes from the church are shown: the chalice is brought out. \n3   In the prison we see Joan kneeling before   her straw cross - this most fragile and exalted of crosses.   She prays in ecstatic joy, at one moment bending right   forward so that her forehead touches the flagstones, the next   moment kneeling with her hands folded and her eyes raised   to heaven as if she saw beings visible only to her. From time   to time she mutters a short prayer. \n4   THE CHURCH \n9    Every face turns towards the entrance. They all see Joan for the first time. It is so quiet in the chapel that you can hear the grating noise of the chains round Joan's ankles. \n10   Joan comes forward. Through the pointed, colored windows the sunlight falls obliquely into the room in long shafts. Suddenly Joan finds herself in the middle of one of these shafts and stops for a moment. She becomes aware that every eye is turned towards her; she sees that they are hard, cold and uncomprehending. For a few seconds it seems as if she is going to collapse, overcome by the cold, remorseless atmosphere. On one side a completely human, simple, young country girl; on the other the flower of this century's talents, learned doctors, the fine fruits of the university, every prodigy in Christendom ... the instruments of reason - and of death. The personification on one side of innocence, on the other of magnificence. The terrible, relentless way in which they look at this girl in man's clothes, all these bishops, all these ascetics and members of orders with their newly cropped tonsures! These learned gentlemen regard her man's shoes and short hair as something loathsome and indecent. They believe as one man that it will be all easy matter to get the upper hand over this child. \n11   With a harsh movement Cauchon orders Joan over to the seat for the accused. \n12   She remains standing for a moment, drooping under the heavy burden of her chains. Then she sits down. Her face is pale and marked with grief and suffering. She lets her eyes wander over these rows of men in clerical garb - alone and unaided she must battle with them to save her name and her life. She leans towards Massieu and says a few quiet words to him as if to remind him of some promise. Massieu says to Cauchon: \nThe accused begs humbly for leave to go to confession ... \nThe bishop, who is engaged in thumbing through some documents which one of the prelates, Loiseleur, has just brought him, discusses the request briefly with the Inquisitor, and replies that he is obliged to deny her this favor because of her indecent dress. \n13   Then he opens the session and orders Joan to take the oath. With a gesture he indicates that the Bible is to be fetched and placed in front of Joan. She kneels, folds her hands over the book and recites the oath: \nI swear by the Holy Gospels to speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, concerning the mission which has been entrusted to me by the King of Heaven. \n14   There is a hush in the room. At this moment, when everything is quiet, a small door opens, giving direct access to the castle from the chapel. It is Warwick, the English governor and general, who enters. The respect shown to the new arrival by some of the soldiers in his vicinity suggests that he is a person of some importance. As the Commander-in-Chief of the English army of occupation he is the real, though unrecognized, driving force behind the trial. He has come for the purpose of speeding things up, but he keeps in the background - like an accomplished butler who supervises from a distance and sees that everything is proceeding smoothly. For the moment he remains standing just inside the door; presently he comes further forward and is hidden by columns. At one point we see him in conversation with Loiseleur. \n15   Joan has sat down again, and the hearing begins. Cauchon asks Joan her name. She answers: \nAt home I am called Jeannette ... Here they call me Joan! \n16   Cauchon asks her age. Joan thinks and counts on her fingers: \nNineteen ... I think. \n17   Cauchon, after smiling to his neighbor, asks: \nCan you say Our Father? \nSo you believe that God hates the English? \nJoan does not immediately understand the question, and the examining judge has to repeat it. Then Joan gives one of her brilliant, inspired answers: \nI know not whether God loves or hates the English ... \n21   Disappointment on the judges' faces. Joan continues, with a strength which suddenly reveals a new side of her character, and turning towards the English soldiers: \nBut I know for certain that the English will all be driven out of France ... \nCommotion and protests among the soldiers: why should Joan be allowed to insult England? But Joan continues inflexibly: \n... except for those who are going to die here! \nThe soldiers are furious. They can no longer contain themselves. One of them makes a movement towards the accused. Massieu leaps to her defense. But Cauchon intervenes and orders silence; he has to use all his authority to restore order among the judges. The hearing continues. \n22   Cauchon asks: \nYou have told how Saint Michael appeared to you ... how did you greet him? \nJoan explains that she has always greeted Saint Michael in the way one should greet a saint. One of the judges tells her to show how she greeted Saint Michael. \n23   With touching simplicity Joan kneels, goes through the motion of taking off her cap, and bows reverently before the imagined saint. She gets up again, while the judges talk together. \n24   Cauchon continues: \nIn what form did he reveal himself? \nJoan does not immediately grasp the question. Half the judges shout to one another. \nWhy are you wearing men's clothes? \nJoan refuses several times to answer and remains sitting motionless, stiff as a ramrod. The judge says: \nAre you willing to wear a woman's dress? \n30   Massieu leans towards her and advises her to accept this suggestion, which he thinks must be very easy for her to do. But Joan looks at him with the air of one treasuring a great secret, and says no to the judge. When the judge presses her to tell him why she refuses, she answers: \nWhen I have completed the task which God has entrusted to me, then I will wear women's clothes again. \nWhispering among the judges - \n31   An indication that another trap is being prepared. Then one of the judges says: \nSo it is God who has commanded you to go about in men's clothes? \nJoan answers unhesitatingly: \nYes! \nA smile of triumph spreads from face to face among Joan's judges. \n32   The Promoter, Jean d'Estivet, complacently makes some notes. Then he leans forward over his desk, smiles and asks in an insincere tone of voice: \nAnd what reward do you hope to obtain from the Lord? \n33   Joan, whose expression is that of a saint, folds her hands on her breast and raises her eyes to heaven: \nThe salvation of my soul! \n40   Paul Jorge [the name of one of the actors] prepares to rise and ask the meaning of this incident. \n41   Cauchon stops him with a movement, and gives the order for the session to continue. He asks Joan: \nHas God promised you anything? \nJoan gives an absent-minded nod. Cauchon presses her to tell him what it is that God has promised. \nCan you not tell us what it is that God has promised you? \nCauchon asks with his most ingratiating smile, but Joan shakes her head. Cauchon tries to persuade her: \nYou must tell us. \nBut Joan declines to answer: \nThat has nothing to do with your trial!** \n42   Cauchon maintains the contrary, and Joan tells him to ask the assembly. Cauchon turns to the judges and asks: \nHas this question any bearing on the trial? \nHe orders those who consider that it has to raise their hands. Nearly every hand goes up. Then it is the turn of those who take the opposite view. Ladvenu is the only one to raise his hand, but when he sees that he is entirely alone he takes it down again. \n43   And Cauchon is able to say to Joan that, since the relevance of the question to the trial has been unanimously agreed, she is obliged to answer. He repeats his question: \nWhat has God promised you? \nJoan does not answer. \n48   THE PRISON \nMassieu has brought Joan back. The door closes behind her. Overcome by fatigue, she sits on her bed. In front of the judges she has restrained her weeping. Now that she is alone, the pent-up tears pour from her eyes. \n49   THE CHAPEL \nThe conference is still going on. Loiseleur is dictating to the notaries. At intervals one of the other judges interposes a word or a suggestion. \n50   THE PRISON \nJoan is still shaking with sobs. Suddenly she sees a cross slowly forming on the floor close to her feet. It is the shadow of the window grating. She knows this cross and loves it. It always comes when she is feeling lonely and unhappy. She has no doubt that it is God who sends her solace and encouragement in this way. She dries her eyes and produces from a hiding-place a piece of handiwork, with which she occupies her hands and her thoughts when she is not before the judges. It is a crown of plaited straw - very simple, pretty and childlike. Soon she is completely absorbed in this work, to which she devotes all her love. We see the Joan from Domr\u00e9my who 'is second to no woman in Rouen, when it comes to spinning or sewing.' From time to time she looks at the cross on the ground. \n51   The conference in the chapel. Loiseleur finishes his dictating. The notary reads back to him. \n52   THE PRISON \nWe see only Joan's hands which are occupied in plaiting her crown. The shot is taken in such a way that the crown and the cross on the ground can be seen together. \n53   The conference in the chapel. The notary finishes his reading aloud and what he has read is approved. Meanwhile the secretary has returned. He hands a document to Warwick, who passes it round. It goes from hand to hand, and finally to the notary. \n54   In the little ante-room leading to Joan's prison. The soldiers are playing with a small English dog. An old serving woman comes with food for Joan in an earthenware bowl. One of the soldiers seizes the bowl; he selects the best piece of meat and gives it to the dog. The latter swallows the meat and licks the soldier's fingers. With the same fingers he picks out another piece of meat and gives this also to the dog. \n55   A short scene from the conference, featuring two documents. A hand - that of the notary - is engaged in copying the signature from one document to the other. \n56   THE PRISON \nThe soldier comes in with Joan's food, followed by the dog. Two other soldiers appear in the door, for these rascals never lose an opportunity of tormenting their victim. As the soldier hands Joan the food, his eye falls on her ring. He demands it from her, but she implores him to let her keep it: it is her mother's ring. But the soldier is determined to have it, even if he has to use force. He calls to the other two soldiers to come and help him, and puts the bowl of food on the ground in such a position that the dog naturally takes advantage of it. \n57   Just as the first soldier has finally succeeded in forcing the ring from Joan's finger Loiseleur appears in the open door. He appears to be filled with genuine indignation at the sight of the ill treatment to which the three rascals are subjecting Joan. The soldiers have turned round. They are afraid. Loiseleur threatens them and quickly goes up to the soldier who has wrested Joan's ring from her. The soldier is compelled to hand over the ring to Loiseleur, who thereupon orders the three ruffians out of the cell. \n65   Joan confesses her sins like a schoolchild reciting a lesson. Cauchon and his attendants follow the scene attentively from the secret room. With a ledger on his lap the notary takes down everything that Joan says, but it is clear that she is saying nothing of any significance, for all the skill with which Loiseleur presents his questions. So it is not long before Loiseleur gives her a sugary smile and rattles off the absolution. He makes the sign of the cross over her and stands up. \n66   Cauchon and his confidants have left their hiding-place and now come into the cell. The soldiers bring in chairs and a table for the scribe. The judges group themselves in a circle round Joan, some sitting, others standing. Loiseleur places himself behind Cauchon. In addition to the judges, Massieu also is present. \n67   Cauchon gestures to Lema\u00eetre who says to Joan: \nYou profess to be a daughter of God? ... \nJoan agrees with a nod, and Lema\u00eetre continues: \nThen why will you not say Our Father? \nJoan sits motionless for a moment. The judges look at her with watchful eyes. A perceptible change comes over Joan. Her expression is transfigured. A heavenly light spreads over her face, she folds her hands and begins to pray. The sight of this small and helpless woman, turning to God in captivating innocence, makes an involuntary impression on some of the judges. The gentle Massieu in particular can hardly restrain his tears. \nJoan has said the Our Father. Jean d'Estivet is thus obliged to eliminate this important point from his charge-sheet. \n68   Lema\u00eetre continues with the hearing: \nHas God told you that you will be released from your prison? \nJoan smiles and gives Loiseleur a secret, confidential glance. His eyes gleam back at her in complicity. She answers: \nYes ... and by means of a great victory! \n69   The judges are astonished and cross-examine her. They ask her to explain precisely what she knows, and how she has come to know it. But Joan answers: \nI know that God will soon come to my help in a miraculous way! \n70   Jean d'Estivet hastens to write down this important answer. With great secrecy he grips Loiseleur's hand in gratitude. Cauchon, Lema\u00eetre and some of the other judges plot together. \n75   But then the honest and fair-minded Massieu moves convulsively forward and shouts: \nDon't answer, Joan - this question is too dangerous... \nCauchon, enraged, rises in all his majesty and bellows with the full power of his lungs: \nBe quiet, will you, in the Devil's name! \nMassieu defends himself. He explains that nobody has the right to ask such a question of an accused person, least of all when the accused is a young girl standing on her own with nobody to advise her. But Cauchon will tolerate no insubordination. Massieu is forced to kneel there and then and ask for pardon, and must consider himself fortunate not to share de Houppeville's fate. \n76   When peace is restored Cauchon gives orders for the hearing to continue. Lema\u00eetre, still seething, asks: \nAnswer now! Are you in a state of grace? \nJoan opens her mouth to answer, but appears to have second thoughts and remains silent. She looks in the direction of Loiseleur, who is apparently absorbed in his own reflection. He is abandoning her to her fate. In his view she is a certain prey; whether she answers yes or no, she is doomed to perdition. But now that Joan has collected her thoughts again, she gives this admirable answer: \nIf I am not, may God put me there! And if I am, may God so keep me! \n77   Joan has broken the chain of beaters. She realizes this and smiles. But her judges, who have sat there greedily waiting for the prey to fall into the net so that they can hurl themselves on it - these judges now sit not knowing what to say or where to look. They gaze at each other in speechless amazement. Some of them unconsciously make the sign of the cross. Loiseleur is beyond doubt the most disconcerted. All of them feel that they have suffered a defeat. This battle is lost; now they must try to win the next one. A short conference takes place. The judges rise to go. \n78   Joan throws herself at Cauchon's feet, embraces his knees and begs him: \nI implore you to let me come to Mass! \nCauchon thrusts her away so brutally that she hits the bed. She remains lying on the floor. \n79   Loiseleur has hastily stolen over to Cauchon and is whispering something in his ear. Cauchon's face lights up. He whispers to the others, letting them in on Loiseleur's plan. Then he approaches Joan and says to her in his mildest voice: \nJoan, if you were allowed to go to Mass now ... \nJoan cries out and collapses. \nThe judges watch her for a moment. Ladvenu full of sympathy. Then Cauchon turns to Massieu and says: \nGo and prepare the instruments of torture! \nMassieu can hardly believe his ears. Are they really going to torture Joan? But a look from Cauchon prevents him from saying anything. He goes out through the door, giving Joan a look of compassion as he does so. \n82   The soldiers, who have witnessed the examination, escort him out, and in the ante-room they reproach and abuse him: \nWhy did you make signs to her and give her good advice? \nThey threaten to throw him into the Seine if this happens again. \n83   THE PRISON \nThe judges leave Joan, Loiseleur being the last to go. Before he leaves the cell he approaches Joan and pats her hair sympathetically: \nDo not grieve ... place your trust in God, he will not forget you! \nJoan turns her tear-stained face to him; full of gratitude for his kind words, she kisses his hand. Then Loiseleur goes out. \nJoan is left in solitude for a mere moment, before the soldiers enter in order to bait her in their usual manner. Joan takes no notice of them. One of them tickles her in the ear with a straw. Joan gets up laboriously and sits down on the bed. One of the soldiers suddenly catches sight of the straw crown. He laughs, picks it up, turns it round in his hands, and finally places it on Joan's head. Outraged by this form of sacrilege, she removes it and puts it on the bed; but the soldier replaces the crown on her head, at the same time giving her several slaps in the face. He steps back and peeps through the hollow of his hand, as if to see her better. \n84   The other soldiers roar with laughter and say in mocking tones: \nShe looks just like a daughter of God, eh? \nHe takes an arrow from his quiver, and places it in Joan's hands. She lets him do this without resistance. \nMeanwhile Warwick has gone from the sick-bed over to the door. \n103   Enter Loiseleur with the news that Cauchon is waiting in the adjoining room. Warwick is about to go when one of the doctors approaches him and says: \nShe has a fever, we shall have to bleed her ... \nWarwick shows signs of unease, and asks whether this is really necessary. \nThe doctor insists that it is. Warwick consents, adding: \nBut take good care that she does not do away with herself ... she is very crafty. \n104   The doctor turns back to the bed to prepare for the blood- letting. Warwick accompanies Loiseleur into the adjoining room, where Cauchon and some of the other judges are waiting. Cauchon enquires after Joan. Warwick answers in a manner which cannot be misunderstood: \nShe is very weak... \nThe two men exchange glances. Cauchon and the judges have come to extort a confession from Joan. 'whether because they were afraid of her escaping in this way and dying without having made a recantation, or because her weakened physical condition raised hopes of her soul being easier to purchase.' \nCauchon explains to Warwick how he wants to proceed. Loiseleur joins in the discussion and proposes a drastic remedy. Cauchon approves Loiseleur's idea and tells Massieu and another young monk to fetch the holy vessel. \n105   While this is going on, scenes are shown from the sick-bed and Joan's blood-letting. One of the doctors goes out in order to report that the blood-letting is finished. The patient is better and can undergo examination without danger. \nCauchon, Loiseleur and some of the other clerics come into the cell. Warwick remains with the doctors in the adjoining room. \n106   Joan is lying with closed eyes. Cauchon goes over to the bed and bends over Joan with a benevolent, paternal expression. He touches her on the temples. Joan opens her feverish eyes. He asks her in a friendly manner how she is. She makes a movement with her head and at the same time gives a feeble smile. Her eyes shift from Cauchon to the others; what is going to happen now? She is evidently taken by surprise. \n107   Cauchon guesses her thoughts, calms her and says: \nWe have come to give you comfort and strength ... \nBlasphemy! She is possessed! This is monstrous! \nThe judges huddle together in their agitation and terror, and gradually withdraw. \n122   And now Joan falls back on her bed, exhausted. She groans and gasps for breath. She wipes the sweat from her forehead with her sleeve. For a moment there is silence. Only her groans can be heard. The judges look at each other, not knowing what to do. Then they turn to Cauchon who is pondering. It is he who breaks the silence with the following words addressed to Massieu: \nThere is nothing for it ... give the executioner his orders! \nWhile the doctors who have entered during the preceding scene are attending to Joan, the judges leave the room. \n123   By the time the judges come out into the castle yard, there are already rumors of what has happened in the cell. The inhabitants of the castle crowd round to hear the news and learn of the preparations now in hand for the penultimate act of the drama. From the castle yard a small door leads out to the churchyard, which lies outside the castle walls. The judges make for the churchyard. \n124   THE PRISON \nSome soldiers have come with a stretcher. They lift Joan onto it and carry her out. \n125   THE CHURCHYARD \nOne group of judges after another is seen moving forward to the spot from which they are to witness the impending ceremony. \n126   Joan, lying on the stretcher, is carried into the churchyard. \n127   The churchyard, which is surrounded by walls, is very big, but only a few graves can be seen in it. They are all covered with flat stones after the custom of the Middle Ages. In those days churchyards served as a meeting-place at certain festivals, and the judicial authorities of the Church often used them as a stage for important announcements and abjurations, which they wanted known to as many people as possible; they formed a theatrical setting, with graves and gravestones as sets. A stench of putrefaction arose from this earth filled with dead bodies. The poisonous smell of nothingness. The smell of stones, corpses and worms. Against the buttress of the church two platforms have been erected and covered with red velvet. On one of them the entire assembly of judges is sitting in state: Pierre Cauchon, the Inquisitor, and a host of jurists in scarlet caps and purple skull-caps. The other platform is for Joan. \n128   Escorted by English soldiers, Joan's little procession comes slowly to this place. \n129   Everywhere in the churchyard, and even on the walls, there are thousands of people, heads jostling. The great majority of them are favorably disposed towards Joan. When she is carried in, every neck is craned to catch a glimpse of her. For her part Joan tries to read her destiny in their faces. From the way they look at her she gets the impression that their feelings towards her are friendly. Joan, who for months has lived remote from this earth, is visibly moved. She smiles at the tiny flowers which greet her from the grass. She almost touches them with her hand and imagines that she is caressing them. But when she looks in the other direction, her eye falls on two gravediggers who are engaged in opening up an old grave. She sees the worms swarming in the skulls which are thrown up, and she is filled with the fear of death. Once more she ponders over the words which the members of the judicial body have addressed to her, and she thinks sadly of her fellow countrymen, who seem to have forsaken her completely. \n130   The tiny procession approaches the platform reserved for Joan. Loiseleur comes forward to meet the procession and assist her. She smiles happily at this man, whom she believes to be on her side. She is helped to a seat on a little stool. \n139   Thrown out of his stride by Joan's answer, the preacher embarks on a tirade, which Joan answers confidently; finally, not knowing how to respond, he shouts to Massieu: \nMake her be quiet! \nThe spectators derive much derisive enjoyment from this little scene. \nOrder has been restored on the platform. Massieu has persuaded Joan to keep quiet. The preacher is approaching his peroration. He points to the judges and declares they have proved incontestably that Joan has violated the Church's doctrines in deed as well as in word; and asks her if she has anything to say in answer to this. She reflects for a moment and, while the spectators stand on tiptoe to see what is happening, she rises to her feet and says: \nI alone am responsible for everything that I have said and done ... \nJoan draws a deep breath before continuing. All those standing round her gaze at her expectantly. Then she says: \n... If have done any wrong, I am to blame, and nobody else! \n140   She sits down calmly. Erard, however, is almost inclined to interpret her words as a declaration that she is now ready to recognize the error of her ways. He leans forward towards the notary, who hands her a paper. Several of the judges have come forward, also one of Warwick's secretaries. There is so much tumult and confusion round Joan that she has difficulty hearing. Sommaire explains: \nIt is the abjuration ... \nJoan does not understand what this means. What is the meaning of 'abjure'? She turns to Erard to ask his advice. \nExplain it to her! \nErard orders Massieu. The latter asks to be excused, but after glancing at Erard he does not dare to insist, and is obliged to advise Joan of the danger she will incur by refusing. He says to her: \nIf you do not sign you will be burnt! \n141   Among the crowd thronging the place the word 'burnt' can be heard flying from mouth to mouth. Around Joan on the platform the air is filled with shouted words. Joan asks Massieu for advice; he tells her that when the Church advises her to sign she must do so. Once again she turns to Erard and asks him to tell her whether she must abjure. He answers: \nEither you sign - or you will go to the stake! \nYou have done a good day's work today ... you have saved your soul! \n149   And he hurries away to give Cauchon the document. \nAmong the spectators the tension is released in shouts of joy. But one or two English soldiers, who have seen Joan's smile, go up to her and shout at the priests around her: \nShe has only made fools of you! \nThe priests push them away. Cauchon, who has received the document, now gives a signal for Joan to come forward and hear her sentence of judgement. \n150   Joan descends from the platform, leaning on Massieu. In his enthusiasm one of the spectators forgets himself and bursts out: \nLong live the Maid! ... Long live France! \nTwo soldiers turn abruptly, force their way through the crowd, seize the unfortunate man who has given vent to his patriotic feelings, and lead him away. \n151   Joan has come before her judges' great platform. Cauchon takes the document from his secretary and begins to read it aloud: \nIn as much as you have at last renounced the error of your ways, we release you from excommunication from the Church ... \nCauchon pauses for a moment. Joan stands before her judges with folded hands. A smile of gratitude is sketched on her face. She lowers her head to conceal her joy. Then Cauchon continues: \nBut in as much as you have rashly sinned we condemn you . .. \nJoan looks up with an expression of fear and surprise. Cauchon continues his reading: \n... to perpetual imprisonment, there to eat the bread of sorrow and drink the water of affliction \nJoan stands for a moment, dumbfounded. It is as if she cannot grasp the meaning of what she has just heard. She feels as if her heart is in her mouth. Her eyes have the expression of a hunted animal. Then she hides her face in her hands and weeps. Cauchon gives a sign for Joan to be led out. She staggers away, leaning on Massieu's arm. \nThe preceding prison scenes alternate with short shots of this folklife: dancing bears - acrobats - jugglers - a musician - a hobby-horse - a dance-leader - a man with a stick over his shoulder and a cask hanging from the stick - penny in the bucket - another musician who has fastened together a drum and a flute, which he holds in the left hand, with the drum-stick in his right. A wild dance - a man selling birds - dwarfs - contortionists. \nThe following prison scene is interrupted by glimpses of the preparations round the bonfire which is to be lit in the castle yard: a man carrying firewood to the stake, a broken carriage-wheel in the fuel, etc. \n158   The jailer now finds Cauchon in conversation with Warwick at the entrance to the chapel. The jailer explains briefly what has happened in the prison. Warwick and Cauchon exchange eloquent glances. At the same moment Loiseleur comes out from the chapel. In a few words Cauchon puts him in the picture and tells him to assemble some of the judges and notaries. \n159   Meanwhile Joan sits waiting impatiently in her prison. It is evident that she does not make a sacrifice such as hers without doing her nature an injury. She is racked by deep despair and her nerves show it. She shivers; her teeth chatter. She wrings her hands so that her knuckles are completely white. \n160   Finally Cauchon enters, followed by various judges and notaries. They find the young girl dissolved in tears, her face contorted. It is a poor, helpless girl of twenty whom they have defeated. \nDuring the following scene Cauchon exudes an air of benevolence and satisfaction. In contrast with his earlier demeanor he is now calm and equable. His feelings are pleasurable, but it is not a malicious pleasure; he is sure of his prey! \nThey sit down, and Cauchon asks Joan why she has sent for them. With a sob, but also with an expression of determination, she answers: \nI have committed a great sin ... \nShe has to break off, choked by tears. \n161   The judges comfort her and try to alleviate her grief, so that she can continue: \n... I have denied God in order to save my life. \nThe judges look at one another. Not one of them is so hard- hearted as to be untouched by the young woman's genuine distress. \n162   Even Cauchon is moved. It is a moment before he speaks. Then he says: \nSo you still believe that you are sent by God? \nJoan nods in confirmation. \nLadvenu, choked by his feelings, is unable to speak. He makes a sign for Massieu to answer on his behalf. Massieu says: \nAt the stake! \nA slight shudder passes over Joan's face, but in her soul there is no longer any struggle or doubt. \n165   Ladvenu, who has now regained his self-control, gives Massieu a quiet order. Massieu goes out hurriedly. When he has gone Ladvenu says: \nHow can you still believe that you are sent by God? \nJoan smiles, as if she knows more than other men, and answers: \nHis ways are not our ways! \nAfter a pause she adds: \nYes, I am His child! \nLadvenu, moved by this persistent faith, says presently: \nAnd the great victory? \nJoan looks at him as if amazed at his asking such a stupid question. She answers: \nMy martyrdom ... \nLadvenu nods. He looks at her as at a saint descended from heaven. Yet he cannot refrain from asking one more question: \nAnd your release? \nFurther away there is a platform for the judges and the English nobility; another is reserved for the preacher and for spectators. \n176   When Joan has taken her place at the stake one of the judges, Nicolas Midi, stands and begins his sermon: \nIn the name of the Lord, amen! \n177   For Joan it is as if his voice has reached her from far away. She weeps incessantly, as she watches the executioner's final preparations; she sees him bending over \n178   His coal-bucket; later she sees him, with a knife in his mouth, uncoiling the rope which is to fasten her to the stake. \n179   Nicolas Midi continues his sermon: \n... Like a rotten member we cut you off from the body of the Church. \nThe preacher turns to face Joan directly; she listens attentively and gives an unconscious nod. At the same moment she sees a flock of doves taking off and flying into the heavens. Then Nicolas Midi ends his short address: \nJoan, go forth in peace ... the Church is unable to protect you! \nJoan, who retains to the end her respect for the Church's servants, inclines politely and gratefully in his direction. \n180   In a loud voice she prays: \nDear God, I accept my death willingly and gladly ... \nHer face becomes more serious and more anguished; she continues: \n... but I entreat Thee, if Thou lovest me, that my suffering may be short ... \n181   Her lament, mild but strongly spoken, rings through the hushed square. Everyone holds his breath to hear the condemned Joan's last words; every eye turns towards her and watches for her smallest movement. They are deeply affected by the simplicity she shows, face to face with death. Many are in tears, even some of the English soldiers. \nThe fire! Get down! \n191   But she implores him urgently to continue right up to the end holding the cross raised before her eyes. \n192   The flames crackle and climb higher. \n193   Suddenly a deathly hush descends on the square. A dull silence. Only the crackle of the flames and the mumbled prayers of the priests can be heard. Oppressed by this stillness, some of the spectators fall on their knees, and others follow their example. Many of them light wax candles. \n194   The flames leap from one faggot to another ... they advance in little jumps over cavities and gaps in the fuel. Sparks fly, smoke whirls up; through the smoke, which occasionally conceals Joan, can be seen part of her \n195   Face, which is raised to heaven, and her mouth, which is whispering prayers. Then her eyes seek Christ, whom Ladvenu continues to hold up towards her; Christ who, like herself, is enveloped in smoke. \n196   Through the smoke she sees the executioner stirring the fire, \n197   And a soldier on his knees trying to get near enough to the bonfire to throw the martyr's crown on it. \n198   She also sees Massieu, who is sprinkling holy water on the bonfire from his stoup. \n199   Meanwhile the judges have risen. The clerics are not allowed to witness the actual execution, but their departure is in the nature of a flight. The eyes of most of them are filled with tears. They all cross themselves as they withdraw. \n200   The English soldiers force a way for them through the crowd, but as the priests approach the spectators the latter draw back of their own accord to avoid contact with them. On every face you can read contempt, in every quarter you can hear the traitors being taunted as such. \n201   Suddenly the first tongues of flame lick round Joan's feet. She squirms. The things of this earth are vanishing, and Joan's thoughts are now only of the King of Heaven. In spite of the pain and terror she does not forget her Christ - indeed it is as if, with every second that passes, she is coming steadily closer to Him. \nJesus! \nshe begins to scream in her long death-struggle. \n202   The weeping crowds repeat the name of Jesus. \n", "test1_input": "Suppose we were to tell you now that your visions did not - as you believe - come from God ... \nJoan looks up quickly, as if unable to believe her ears. She searches the faces of her judges, one after the other. Cauchon continues: \n... but are sent to you by the Devil, who wants to bring your soul to perdition! \nJoan sits for a moment, deep in thought. Then a smile spreads across her face. Almost unconsciously she shakes her head - and smiles again. Assuredly the Devil has no power over her and is not going to obtain it either. \n91   One of the judges asks: \nIf the Devil appeared in the form of an angel, how could you be certain whether it was a good or a bad angel? \nFor a moment the smile fades from Joan's lips. She does not answer. Cauchon looks at her for a long time and then says: \nIt is Satan to whom you have knelt, not Saint Michael! \nJoan finds this idea so comical that she has to laugh. She cannot help herself; it is not a provocative laugh, only the spontaneous laughter of a healthy person. But Cauchon strikes the table in anger. Joan stops laughing. Cauchon gazes fixedly at her for some time without saying a word. There is complete silence in the room. \n92   Cauchon gets up, approaches Joan in a dignified manner, leans towards her and says: \nHow can you believe that it is God who guides your steps when you see the abyss opening before your feet? \nJoan is serious again. Cauchon continues, pronouncing the words with steadily increasing emphasis: \nDo you not understand that it is the Devil who has turned your head \nHe pauses briefly, then continues: \n... who has deceived you ... \n", "test1_true": "... and betrayed you? \nWhile Cauchon has been speaking a change has come over Joan. It is clear that she is tormented by doubts. God has promised her that she will be set free. Why has God not kept his promise to her? Why does he let her stand alone against all these churchmen, these learned doctors? She even asks herself whether she has the right to talk as she does in front of all these gifted and erudite men. Is it true that she is full of pride? Is it the Devil who has possessed her and insinuated in her mind everything that she believed to have come from God? \n93   Cauchon, judge of character that he is, has no difficulty in seeing what is going on in this young woman's heart. While Joan is wrestling with her doubts he orders a small table to be set in front of her. He puts a document on the table and then places a pen in her hand. Half absentmindedly she lets him do all this, but when Cauchon tries to persuade her to sign she tells him that she is unable to read. Cauchon tells the notary to read the declaration aloud: \n... I declare that I am guilty of the crimes with which I am charged, and which the Devil has misled me into committing. I confess that my visions are the work of the Devil, and I am ready to return to the path of truth and, before all the world, to recant ... \n94   When the notary has finished reading aloud, Cauchon tells Joan warningly that she must sign the declaration, and adds: \nThe Church is opening her arms to you ... \nJoan's expression makes it clear that she has almost overcome her doubts. Her faith in God and belief in her mission are on the point of gaining the upper hand. \nCauchon threatens her: \n... but if you do not sign, the Church will turn her back on you and you will stand alone ... \nJoan's crisis is over. Once again she sees clearly the path she must follow. Quietly she puts away the pen. Cauchon sees this and thunders: \n... alone ... \nBut a heavenly light shines from Joan's face. She smiles. With her eyes raised to heaven she says: \n... alone - with God! \n95   Cauchon, realizing that his prey is about to escape him, increases his exertions and displays all his powers of persuasion. Does she know that the Church has the means to compel her? Is she familiar with the secrets of the torture? Cauchon's threats make no impression on Joan. \nShe feels safe with her God. Her face is transfigured by a beautiful light as she says: \n", "test2_input": "I would rather die than deny God's acts. \nEnraged by Joan's pig-headedness, Cauchon loses patience. He orders Joan to be put to torture. While the executioners are taking care of her the judges gather together in a group. \nOne instrument of torture after another is displayed for Joan's benefit. With an executioner at her side she is conducted past the various appliances. She looks at each one for a long time, trembling with fear. Occasionally the executioner demonstrates with a gesture how one of the instruments is operated. They are trying to frighten Joan out of her senses. \nWhen the executioners have completed their preparations and the torture can begin, Cauchon goes up to Joan and invites her once again to sign the declaration. She refuses and says: \nEven though you torture my soul out of my body I shall confess nothing \nCauchon gives orders for the torture to begin. Joan lets out a scream of pain. She is seen to raise one hand. They all think she is indicating her readiness to sign. A judge holds the document out to her, but Joan thrusts it away so violently that it falls on the ground. Somebody picks it up. And Joan says vehemently: \n... and if I should confess anything, I will afterwards declare that it was only by using force that you made me confess. \n96    Joan collapses. The executioner bends over her. She has fainted. \n97    The executioner and Massieu carry her out while the judges confer on what procedure to adopt next. \n98    THE PRISON \nMassieu has gone on ahead to notify Joan's keeper, who sends a man out with a message for Warwick. Massieu prepares Joan's bed and takes the little crown in his hands; he looks at it for a moment, then flings it into a corner. Enter the executioner and his assistant, carrying Joan between them. They lay her on the bed and go out. Before Massieu leaves the cell, he gives one of the soldiers instructions to keep an eye on Joan. \n99    THE TORTURE-CHAMBER \nThe judges confer. Cauchon thinks the torture should continue, and asks the judges to vote on this proposal, but only one of them is in favor of continuing. This is Loiseleur, who says: \nIt is medicine for her soul! \nLadvenu gives Loiseleur a look of hostility. \n", "test2_true": "Joan is lying on her wretched bed. The chains, the brutal soldiers, terror, fatigue, and finally the torture have exhausted her strength. She is unrecognizable. Her face is as white as a sheet. Deep shadows under her eyes. When the scene opens, she is lying in a feverish doze. She breathes rapidly and with difficulty. \nA soldier with a hard, repellent face is watching at her side. Joan opens her eyes and says: \nI am thirsty! \nThe soldier looks at her with an unfeeling, hostile expression. Then he takes the bowl of water and pours the water over the floor. \n101   THE TORTURE-CHAMBER \nThe judges have not yet concluded their conference. They still seem unable to agree on whether the torture shall continue or not. However, Master Erard wins a majority of the votes when he declares: \nThis heart is much too hardened ... \nthere is no hope of our getting a recantation this time - we will have to wait! \nCauchon disagrees. A confession would be valuable, even if it was subsequently withdrawn. But Erard continues: \n... and she might die at our hands! \nCauchon yields to this argument. Even Loiseleur defers to Erard and admits that it would be very damaging to all their interests if Joan died at the hands of the executioner. She would then be certain to enjoy a martyr's glory. Having decided to give up the torture they leave the torture- chamber. \n102   THE PRISON \nEnter Warwick. He goes over to the bed and bends over Joan - not with any feeling of sympathy. Joan opens her eyes for a moment and meets his cold, hostile gaze. Then she relapses into her state of lethargy. Warwick goes from the bed towards the door, which he has left standing open behind him. Two doctors whom he has sent for come into the cell. He follows them over to the bed, where he speaks the famous words which for sheer brutality are without parallel in history: \nI would not have her die a natural death on any account ... she has cost me too much for that... \nThe doctors begin to examine Joan. They feel her thighs and right side. \n", "test3_input": "Then the notary places a document in front of Joan and offers her a pen. Joan looks in amazement at the document, which she recognizes: it is the same declaration which was placed in front of her for her to sign during the torture scene. Her look of astonishment shifts from the notary to the document and from the latter to Cauchon. \n112   She explains once more that all the accusations in the document are what God has commanded her to do. She cannot recant like this without denying her God. Cauchon bends over her and says: \nThe Sacrament ... is it not a great blessing? \nJoan nods, and her expression seems to want to say: of course, everybody knows that the Church has no greater treasure. \nCauchon continues: \n... But you will never share in the Church's blessings, if you do not expiate your sins. \n113   He indicates to Joan that she must sign. One of the judges approaches with a wafer. An expression of misery and pain lies on Joan's face as she sits there, sick, feverish and racked with doubts. On one side she sees the wafer, which is more precious to her than life itself, on the other side the document, which will make her confess that she is an agent of the Devil. \n114   As if talking to herself and her conscience, she says: \nI am a good Christian ... \nAs she sits there, alone with all these men, she is the picture of utter despair and loneliness. They all gaze at her with fixed stares. Nobody speaks to her. Finally Cauchon breaks the silence. In a quiet voice he advises Joan to sign and save her soul; but Joan has now mastered her temptation. She hands back the paper. Her body is broken. But the strength of her spirit is unaltered. \nFor a moment they are all struck dumb. \n115   Cauchon gestures, ordering the Sacrament to be carried out. The tears run down Joan's cheeks, when she sees the priests going out with the sacred vessel. \nI love God ... I love Him with all my heart! \nshe says. \n116   Loiseleur, who has accompanied the procession into the adjoining room, tells Warwick the outcome. \n", "test3_true": "118   Jean d'Estivet reproaches her harshly for allowing her vanity to take precedence over the salvation of her soul. He concludes with these words: \nIf you die in this hour, you die as an infidel... \nJoan, goaded by the mental torture to which she has been subjected, answers in words conjured up by her sancta simplicitas; but Jean d'Estivet, revelling in the pain his speech has given Joan, obliterates her with the wounding words, which sting like the lash of a whip: \nYour soul is doomed to perdition \nTo which one of the others adds: \n... to everlasting torture in the flames of Hell! \n119   Groaning under the burden of the injustice and malice they are heaping on her, Joan turns for comfort to Cauchon, whose hand she has just pressed to her cheek; but Cauchon has no comfort to give. He draws back and says coldly: \nJoan, you are a child of the Devil! \n120   She looks at him in unaffected terror. Then it is as if a veil gradually falls from her eyes; as if the whole truth is revealed to her in a flash of lightning. They have lied to her in order to trap her. In her overwrought and exhausted condition she loses all self-control. Fever and ecstasy take charge of her features. As a stream of reproaches pours from her lips they all gaze at her in terror: is this the last flare-up before death, is it madness? All of them feel themselves face to face with something unfamiliar and extraordinary. Slowly they draw away. Cauchon rises and backs round his chair. \n121   Foaming at the mouth, Joan continues to pour out a torrent of words: \nYou say that I am a child of the Devil... \nand she continues: \n... but I say it is you who have been sent by the Devil to torment me! \nShe stands up in bed, pointing at each judge in turn. \nA violent storm of anger breaks out: \n"}

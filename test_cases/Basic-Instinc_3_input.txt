A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn. He sees the outline of her body now. 
She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing. 
INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT 
He is alone, nobody else in the big room. 
He sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has punched in 
HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY. 
He is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen 
NOTHING CURRENT. 
A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these words 
RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965. 
We see him type in the words 
PRIOR ARREST RECORD. 
A long beat, and then it comes up 
HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO 
He stares at the screen a long beat. 
GUS (behind him) Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine? 
NICK (after a beat; lost in his thoughts) What are you doing here, Pop? 
GUS (grins) I came in here to jack off the damn machine. (a beat) One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor. 
Nick looks at him a beat. 
NICK Was she ever suspect? 
GUS No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her. 
Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere. 
NICK (slowly) Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins? 
GUS (grins) Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it. 
Nick just stares at him. 
EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY 
He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car. He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex leotards. 
CATHERINE Hi. 
He looks at her a beat, then -- 
NICK Am I... disturbing you? 
CATHERINE No.  Come in. 
They have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to go in. 
INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE 
She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns the Stones DOWN. 
On a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him. 
We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW. She sees him glancing at the clips. 
CATHERINE I'm using you for my detective. In my book.  You don't mind, do you? 
She smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless. 
CATHERINE Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one. 
NICK No, thanks. 
She goes to the bar. 
CATHERINE (smiles) That's right.  You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you?

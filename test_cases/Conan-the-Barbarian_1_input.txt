CONAN (CONT'D) Let's go. 
EXT. CIRCULAR STAIRWAY - CISTERN 
As they work their way up the circular stairwell, towards a thin shaft of firelight up ahead. 
INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT 
Carved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors, leading to prison cells. 
Conan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way to the floor of the hallway. The heavy darkness presses in on Conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing. 
The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES, in varying states of decay. There are buckets, filled with entrails and feces, upended. Tamara put her hand over her mouth. 
Conan continues down the hallway. He and Tamara begin to hear the sound of EERIE CHANTING. 
TAMARA What is that? 
Up ahead, the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as the torches end. Conan holds up his own torch, struggling to peer into the black void. 
CONAN Nothing good. 
Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND blows out his torch. A moment later, there's the sound of A GATE WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND. 
In the darkness, comes a DEEP, EARTHY CHUCKLE. 
VOICE (O.S.) Welcome. 
A HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP, revealing that the gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a vast CAGE built around a massive PIT. 
INT. THE PIT - NIGHT 
The same pit where Fariq sacrificed the female monk, only now, a half dozen COMBATANTS stand on the grid above the void. 
Hanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other PRISONERS, including Tamara's fellow female monks. Several of them YELL out Tamara's name as they see her. 
And watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage, is the massive Akhun and several of his slavers. 
AKHUN Which ever one of you slaves gets me the girl, lives. 
The Combatants all close in on Conan and Tamara, each taking a different plank way to get to them. 
CONAN (TO TAMARA) Stay behind me. 
Tamara steps behind Conan, who blocks the others' path to her. 
CONAN (CONT'D) Who dies first? 
The first two COMBATANTS attack as one, the first wielding a short sword, the other a pike. The pikeman thrusts first, Conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending the wielder off balance and into the abyss. 
The prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better, as Conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single blow. 
TAMARA 
Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the top half of the metallic cage. She begins scaling the cage, her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks. 
CONAN 
Three more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo. Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much like the one Conan cut through earlier. 
TENTACLED MONSTER 
Up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a gigantic octopus-like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth. 
The creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in its gnashing maw. 
The creature reaches for Conan, who ducks underneath the tentacle, the slices it off. He immediately turns back to check on Tamara -- and he discovers she's not there. 
He looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty feet directly above him. 
CONAN (CONT'D) Crom! 
AKHUN 
The massive warrior spots Tamara getting close to the prisoner baskets and motions to his two Jailers. 
AKHUN Get her!

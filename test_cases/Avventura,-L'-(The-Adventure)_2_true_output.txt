PATRIZIA (to the sailor) How long will it take to go there and come back? 
SAILOR If there's a police station at Panarea, it should take us a couple of hours. But if we have to go to Lipari, it will take much longer. Then it also depends on how rough the sea is. 
Giulia is about to get on her way but she stops and turns around to look for Corrado, who notices her looking at him. 
CORRADO I'll stay here also. 
GIULIA (alarmed) But why?... What if it starts to rain? 
CORRADO If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella. 
Claudia, who has remained to one side, wrapped up in her own thoughts, doesn't make a move to leave. Sandro and Corrado look at her in surprise. 
CORRADO (to Claudia, understandingly) Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying... 
SANDRO I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance. 
Ignoring Sandro's remark, Claudia turns and determinedly heads towards the interior of the island. Meanwhile, Patrizia and Giulia have gone aboard the yacht. 
GIULIA (calling to Corrado from the boat) Do you want some blankets? ... and something to eat? 
Corrado makes an irritated gesture signifying no, then together with Sandro starts climbing up the rocky slope towards the stone hut. As they meet up with Claudia midway, the first drops of rain start to fall and it is clear that the storm is on the verge of breaking. The three of them reach the door of the hut and Corrado tries to pull it open, but the lock resists. Then Sandro comes to his aid, and placing their shoulders up against the wooden door, they finally manage to force it open. 
Inside the hut it is pitch black. Sandro strikes a match and finds a kerosene lamp on a nearby table. He lights it and the room is suddenly illuminated, revealing a miserable interior with a few broken chairs, several empty boxes, a shovel and a few other utensils. Over to one side is a small pile of straw suggesting a makeshift bed. 
CLAUDIA As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true. 
SANDRO And why do you tell us this only now? 
CLAUDIA I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it... 
CORRADO Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that? 
CLAUDIA (indicating Sandro) Maybe you'd better ask him. 
CORRADO (to Sandro) What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious... 
SANDRO Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone. 
CLAUDIA And how do you explain that? 
Ignoring the question, Sandro begins pacing back and forth across the room. The silence is broken only by the sound of the rain outside which is now coming down harder and harder. Suddenly, footsteps are heard approaching the hut. Sandro, Claudia and Corrado quickly turn around and face the door, their faces clearly revealing the expectation that it might be Anna. Finally the door begins to open and an old man appears, carrying a sack in his hand. 
SANDRO Are you the owner of this place? 
OLD MAN No. The owners are in Australia. 
SANDRO But where did you come from? 
OLD MAN From Panarea. Why? 
CORRADO Ah, then it was you... I heard a boat leaving here at two o'clock today...

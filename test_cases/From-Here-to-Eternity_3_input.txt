WARDEN (OUTRAGE) Listen, what started all this, anyway? Why'm I shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher! Where'd I come up with a yen for of all things the Compny Commander's wife! And her actin like Lady Astor's horse all because I only got here on time! 
Warden's burst shatters the tension. Karen breaks into laughter. After a moment, Warden joins in. 
KAREN On the other hand, I've got a bathing suit under my dress. 
WARDEN Funny. I got one in a U-Drive-It parked around the corner. 
He takes her hand. They rise and walk away, backs to camera. They merge with the other couples in the little park. 
INT. LARGE CLUB ROOM - NEW CONGRESS - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT COUCH Fatso's piano music o.s. Prew is slumped on the couch. He stubs out the cigarette, which is almost burnt down. He sees someone coming toward him, slowly raises his eyes. Lorene comes into shot, looks down at him. 
PREW How's the surfboard rider? 
LORENE That was a terrible way to have acted. What you did. 
PREW I was jealous. 
LORENE (LAUGHS) You're a funny one. 
PREW What do you dames want? To take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire? 
LORENE (angry because she really LIKES PREW) Now, look here, what do you think Mrs. Kipfer pays us for? We're hired to be nice to all the boys. They're all alike. Is it so important? 
PREW (STANDS; URGENTLY) Yes, it's important. Maybe we seem all alike but none of us is ever all alike. (PAUSE) All right, I'm sorry about before. 
LORENE (touched by his outburst) That piano is about to drive me out of my mind. Let's go up to Mrs. Kipfer's suite and sit there. She lets us use it sometimes... for somebody special. 
PREW Are you mad? 
LORENE No, I'm not mad. 
PREW Because if you're still mad I'd just rather we called the whole thing off. 
LORENE (takes his arm) You certainly are a funny one. 
They walk away from camera, merging with the others in-the room. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT 
FULL SHOT WAVE sweeping over camera, spray flying. 
MEDIUM SHOT ON BEACH A tiny beach set among rocks. The pale sand glows in the moonlight. Warden, in a bathing suit, is lighting a fire about ten yards from the water's edge. Karen is just stepping out of her dress; her bathing suit is underneath. A couple of GI blankets near the fire. Her teeth are beginning to chatter in the chill of the night air; she raises her arms to the sky longingly, happily. 
KAREN I hope the ocean's ice cold. I hope I freeze in a solid chunk. 
WARDEN (sudden, intense laugh) Just so long's you melt afterwards. 
KAREN I love the way you laugh. 
He stands, moves to her. She laughs, turns and runs into the water. He runs after her. 
FULL SHOT WAVE near shore, as Karen dives into it. Warden follows her. The wave washes over them. 
INT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - MRS. KIPFER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT DIVAN CAMERA ANGLED so we see only back of the divan. We hear soft chuckles from Prew and Lorene o.s., then silence for several moments. CAMERA MOVES as we hear a few more low, intimate laughs, then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch, their heads close together as if they have just kissed pleasantly but not passionately. Mrs. Kipfer's living room is on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender feeling. A door leading to another room is half open in b.g. A door leading to a hall is closed. Prew's arm is around Lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with something like wonder. Lorene is mellower, too, making no effort now to be "the Princess." She speaks as if resuming a conversation. 
LORENE ... I enlisted, too. I came out here on my own. To get away from my home town. In Oregon. 
PREW How come? 
LORENE I had a boy friend. I was a waitress. He was from the richest family in town. He just married the girl suitable for his position. After three years of going around with me. (PAUSE) It's a pretty story, isn't it? Maybe they could make a movie of it. 
PREW They did. Ten thousand of them. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Lorene smiles. 
LORENE So I left and went to Seattle, as a waitress. And I met a girl just back from Hawaii. She said she'd made a lot of money working for Mrs. Kipfer. I caught the first boat. I've been here a year and two months. 
PREW You like it much? 
LORENE Oh, I don't like it. But I don't mind it. Anyway, I won't be here forever. 
PREW No. Sure not. I mean, why should you? 
LORENE I have it all figured out. In another year I'll be back home, with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer. And then I will be all set for life -- 
There is a sound at the door and they turn towards it. 
MEDIUM SHOT DOOR TO HALL as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through, its hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle. After a moment, Maggio's head follows the arm through the door. He is grinning like an amateur conspirator. 
MAGGIO I dint hear no sounds of combat. So I figgered maybe you'd like a drink. 
THREE SHOT as Maggio comes into the room. 
MAGGIO Or otherwise old Sandra would of drank it all by herself. She's a fine girl. But she drinks like a fish. 
There are glasses on a cupboard near the divan. Maggio sets three of them up, starts to pour whisky into them. 
LORENE No, thanks. I never drink much.

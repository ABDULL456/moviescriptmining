DR. LING INJECT YOURSELF! 
GOODSPEED LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER? 
The pipes are KNOCKING, now they're COUGHING. 
DR. LONNER It's coming, it's coming ... 
ISHERWOOD sinks to his knees, holding the huge syringe in front of his heart, hari-kari style, hands trembling ... 
GOODSPEED concentrates on the device; his calm is unsettling.  His hands flash, grabbing instruments and performing precise, deft, functions.  He snips a wire and splices it.  Another.  Another. 
DR.  LING (sweating it out) Ten seconds, Bill. 
Isherwood moves the syringe closer to his chest. 
ISHERWOOD Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY IT'S REAL. 
ISHERWOOD drops the syringe.  Fumbles for another... GOODSPEED, ice-cold, continues on the device ... 
DR. LING Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ ... 
GOODSPEEDIS RUBBER GLOVE is stretched to transparency. we see GOODSPEED'S FLESH through the acid-eaten rubber.  He makes one final cut-and-clamp.  THE DETONATOR on the poison gas turns off. 
DR. LING Three, two...  the gas is clear! 
OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - GREEN LIGRTS FLASR on the control panel and A TORRENTIAL SPRAY soaks GOODSPEED AND ISRERWOOD.  Isherwood is wide-eyed and trembling.  Goodspeed glares at him. 
DR. LING Next time use the atropine! 
GOODSPEED I don't like needles. 
EXT.  GEORGETOWN - STREETS/ALLEYWAY - DAY 
The bohemian part around Georgetown U. Goodspeed heads down an alley between two townhouses.  LOUD COUNTRY MUSIC emanates from an apt. above. Goodspeed ascends. 
INT.  GEORGETOWN - GOODSPEED'S APARTMENT - DAY 
A young woman stands in the middle of the living room, belting out a Carlene Carter tune in cowboy boots, rhinestone blouse and skirt.  CARLA PESTALOZZI, 20's, is playing guitar, accompanied by a boom box. 
CARLA Every little dream I dream about you, Every little song I sing about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, (notices Goodspeed) Wanna keep you locked up at home ... 
Goodspeed walks past her into the kitchen.  Carla turns down the music. Goodspeed re-enters with a Budweiser. 
CARLA (New Jersey accent) Hey there. 
GOODSPEED Hey honey. 
CARLA Wrote a new song.  Wanna hear it? 
Goodspeed sits heavily on the couch.  Rubs his temples. 
GOODSPEED Not now. 
CARLA Boy, somebody's in a bad mood. 
GOODSPEED Yeah, somebody's in a bad mood. 
Carla changes the c.d.: A PUCCINI OPERA plays. 
CARLA Better? 
GOODSPEED Much better. She sits with him.  Puts her arm around him. 
CARLA What happened baby.  Tell me. 
GOODSPEED Had a close one. 
CARLA You want to talk about it? 
GOODSPEED Not really. 
CARLA You know how I feel about what you do. 
GOODSPEED Could we change the subject? 
CARLA That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape. 
GOODSPEED Hey!  Now there's some good news. 
CARLA You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music? 
GOODSPEED Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you. (smiles) I hope that's a compliment.  I could change my name.  How 'bout Bobby Sue Pestalozzi?  Billy io Pestalozzi? 
GOODSPEED Stick with Carla.

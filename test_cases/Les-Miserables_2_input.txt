The barricade is now complete: an impressive wall up to twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can be wheeled open to allow access. Two smaller barricades protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his little army. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing armchair - and adds it to the barricade. As the men sing she steals it back defiantly. 
ENJOLRAS Red, the blood of angry men! 
ALL Black, the dark of ages past! Red, a world about to dawn! Black, the night that ends at last! 
87A   EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT                                     87A 
It is night. The students have been waiting for hours. 
A single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles underlights a fluttering red flag. 
There is no sign yet of any opposition. 
A boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade. Marius realizes its Eponine. She sits down with her back to him. 
MARIUS Hey, little boy, what's this I see? God Eponine the things you do! 
EPONINE I know this is no place for me, Still I would rather be with you! 
MARIUS Get out before the trouble starts! Get out, `Ponine, you might get shot! 
EPONINE I've got you worried now, I have! That shows you like me quite a lot... 
MARIUS Get Out! 
Joly, sentry on the main barricade, sees a figure approach. 
JOLY He's back! 
Javert, still in his disguise as a rebel, is let back through the guarded `gate' into the barricaded street. 
JAVERT Listen, my friends, I have done as I said. I have been to their lines, I have counted each man. I will tell what I can. Better be warned They have armies to spare And our danger is real - We will need all our cunning To bring them to heel. 
ENJOLRAS Have faith! If you know what their movements are We'll spoil their game. There are ways that a people can fight - We shall overcome their power! 
JAVERT I have overheard their plans. There will be no attack tonight. They intend to starve you out Before they start a proper fight - Concentrate their force, Hit us when it's light - 
GAVROCHE Liar! 
They all look up. There's Gavroche, on the top of the barricade. 
GAVROCHE Good evening, dear Inspector. Lovely evening, my dear! I know this man, my friends. His name's Inspector Javert! So don't believe a word he says Cause none of it's true. This only goes to show What little people can do. 
Guns swing round to aim at Javert. He stares back in defiance. 
Gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to Courfeyrac's delighted embrace. 
COURFEYRAC Bravo, little Gavroche! You're the top of the class! 
Gavroche grabs Grantaire's red cap and puts it on his own head, mimicking the students. 
PROUVAIRE So what are we going to do With this snake in the grass? 
Enjolras faces Javert. 
ENJOLRAS Tie this man and take him To the tavern in there! The people will decide your fate, Inspector Javert! 
JAVERT Shoot me now or shoot me later - Every schoolboy to his sport! Death to each and every traitor! I renounce your people's court! 
ENJOLRAS Take this man. Bring him through. There is work we have to do. 
Javert is led into the cafe. As they pass through the front door only one student is holding Javert. Seizing his opportunity, Javert breaks free and the students have to subdue him by force. Javert is on his knees and is being tied to the staircase. 
ENJOLRAS When are they coming!? 
Silence. 
Suddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at the barricade here an ominous distant sound. The sound of marching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. First soft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer. Boots on cobbles. The sound comes right into the end of the street. 
Enjolras and all the students man the main barricade. 
Silence. 
They peer over the barricade. In the pitch blackness, all they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. These are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection from the torch. 
A voice shouts out from the darkness. 
ARMY OFFICER Who's there? 
At the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled. 
ENJOLRAS French Revolution.

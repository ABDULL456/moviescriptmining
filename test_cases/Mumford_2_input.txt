MUMFORD (V.O.) The way the District Managers got ahead and won their bonuses was by generating maximum payments. That meant the revenue officers had to use all their "collection tools" -- seizures, liens, levies -- even if a more reasonable compromise could have been worked out. The best way to reduce resistance from the taxpayers was to build a convincing case -- whether there'd actually been a violation or not... 
Mumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof and looks down on a building one block over. It is a small furniture factory. Employees are eating their lunches on the loading dock. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) That's where we came in. Our DM was a particular sonuvabitch, and he knew just how to get Gregory crazy. 
INT. ETHNIC RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
MUMFORD'S POV takes in his ATTRACTIVE DATE next to him, then PANS TO Candy and Gregory across the table. Everybody's laughing. Candy flashes Mumford a momentary special look. MUMFORD'S POV guiltily PANS TO Gregory. Did he see it? 
MUMFORD (V.O.) So several things were working on Gregory when we started building a case against a furniture maker named Edmond Worrell... 
EXT. PARKING LOT, FURNITURE FACTORY - MAGIC 
BINOCULAR VIEW of EDMOND WORRELL and MRS. WORRELL as they get in a Cadillac at the end of a workday. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) ...and his family. 
INT. BUSINESS OFFICE, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT 
Lit by powerful flashlights, Gregory and Mumford attack the files of the company, both in cabinets and on computer. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Gregory was acting more and more irrational. We started doing things that were over the line even for the IRS. When I look back on it now, I'm sure Gregory must have known about Candy and me. On our team, I had become... 
INT. MEN'S ROOM, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP A LINE OF COCAINE on the top of a toilet tank as it is sucked out of sight. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) ...the responsible one. 
INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - DAY 
MUMFORD'S POV IS A BLURRY SHAPE until Candy moves up and away, her face sweaty and aroused, torso naked. She's on top of Mumford. 
INT. GOVERNMENT CAR - DAY 
Mumford's POV slides into the passenger seat. Gregory is already sitting in the driver's seat. He stares at Mumford a long time. 
INT. CORRIDOR, SHABBY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
Mumford is following Gregory and REVENUE OFFICER MCLURE down the hall. They reach a door with the painted sign: "SAMUEL GORBECK, C.P.A." 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Sometimes when a case didn't work out right, Gregory and this Revenue Officer named McLure would put the squeeze on the subject's accountant... 
As they start to enter, SOFT CUT TO: 
INT. GORBECK'S INNER OFFICE - DAY 
GORBECK listens, intimidated by McLure, who sits on the accountant's desk, and Gregory, who is moving around the office -- snooping. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) There aren't many accountants who don't have something to worry about with the Service... 
INT. IRS OFFICES - DAY 
Edmond Worrell, his wife, his adult SON and DAUGHTER, WORRELL'S LAWYER, and, finally, the accountant Gorbeck are ushered toward a conference room by McLure, Gregory and some other IRS types. Gorbeck sneaks a nervous look at Mumford. Gregory, who now appears slightly mad, motions for Mumford to join them. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) The parties met repeatedly over a period of months. The IRS offered to settle for a sizable but, they said, fair amount. Worrell said he'd done nothing wrong and threatened to fight it all the way to Washington. He seemed pretty strong. I was secretly pulling for him. McLure and the District Manager stepped up the pressure. 
EXT. PARKING LOT, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY 
MOVING POV OUT THE WINDSHIELD of Gregory's government car as it comes speeding into the parking lot. There are two flashing Squad Cars and an Ambulance at the entrance. As Gregory's car hits a speedbump, the IMAGE BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) What none of us down at the Service knew was that Edmond Worrell had a story too... Worrell's was that he'd been fighting chronic depression for thirty years. Under the heat of the investigation, he fell off his medication. One Tuesday morning, he went down to the factory early, wrote his family a letter, then used the 9mm automatic they kept there to kill himself... The DM dropped the case that day and started proceedings to get rid of Gregory... 
The IMAGE HAS SLOWED TO A STILL. It now DISSOLVES TO: 
EXT. GREGORY'S HOUSE, CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Mumford's POV as he comes up the steps. The front door opens before he gets there. Candy, her face bruised, her eyes red, comes into view, she has a suitcase in hand. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Gregory went home drunk, beat up Candy and went out to drink some more. Candy told me she didn't want to see me again. She hated us both and she was leaving us both... It made perfect sense to me. I felt the same way... 
INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Mumford is frantically, futilely looking for an imagined drug stash. He's ransacked the place and is now throwing the clothes out of a drawer. 
INT. BATHROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT

GUY ON BENCH (cont'd) Well, the object is to make people think you're going in one direction, then you twist it to keep 'em surprised. I came up with all these amazing twists out of nowhere. Well, not nowhere. (beat) I'm a born again Christian. (beat) You have faith? 
KAUFMAN No.     Not really. 
GUY ON BENCH You don't believe in anything? 
Kaufman shrugs. 
GUY ON BENCH (cont'd) I don't know how you can look out at this beautiful ocean and not believe there's an intelligence that created it. 
KAUFMAN I don't know. 
GUY ON BENCH Well, you can't know until you experience it. That requires accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. Believe me. Lookit, if I was to show you a bottle of clear liquid and told you it was vodka, how would you know if it really was or if it was water? There's only one way. 
KAUFMAN I'd smell it. 
GUY ON BENCH (annoyed) No. You can't smell vodka.    You'd have to taste it, right? 
KAUFMAN It could be poison.    I don't know you. 
GUY ON BENCH (angry) Look, let's go with the analogy I'm drawing here. It's not poison. Okay? (resuming control) (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) GUY ON BENCH (cont'd) So you'd have to taste it to know. Right? That's my point. 
KAUFMAN Right. 
GUY ON BENCH That's all I'm saying. (beat) So West Hollywood, huh? I think I'll make it out this year. Because how long can you look at an ocean, y'know? 
MONTAGE 
Susan Orlean talks to various orchid enthusiasts, visits nurseries, sits in lecture halls, attends orchid shows, sits in the library reading orchid books. She is bored and distracted. 
INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 
A stewardess places a cup and an airline-sized bottle of vodka down in front of a lost Kaufman. He smiles at her.    No response. He opens the bottle and smells the vodka. 
INT. LIMO - NIGHT 
Kaufman sits in the back seat and stares out the window. The driver looks at him a couple of times in his rearview mirror. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) I have failed. I have nothing to say.    I am fat. I am not a writer. 
DRIVER Mr. Kaufman, do you mind if I ask what type of work you do for Sony? 
KAUFMAN I'm a writer. 
DRIVER (impressed) A song writer? 
KAUFMAN No, I'm a screenwriter. 
DRIVER Oh, wow! Good for you. You mind if I ask what your movie's about? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN It's about flowers. 
No response.   Kaufman tries to make it interesting. 
KAUFMAN (cont'd) It's about this poacher who steals orchids out of a swamp. 
DRIVER I heard about that!   Drug flowers, right? 
KAUFMAN Yeah.   That's it. 
DRIVER I heard about that! That's great! Action-adventure is my favorite genre. 
INT. EMPTY HOUSE - NIGHT 
Kaufman enters with his bags and heads to the stairs. Donald, typing furiously at his desk, looks up. 
DONALD How was Florida, man? 
KAUFMAN (climbing the stairs) Okay. 
DONALD Cool! Hey, my script's going amazing! Right now I'm working out an Image System. Bob calls it an invaluable asset. Because of my multiple personality theme, I've chosen the motif of broken mirrors to show my protagonist's fragmented self. Bob teaches that an Image System greatly increases the complexity of an aesthetic emotion. 
KAUFMAN You sound like you're in a cult. 
Kaufman disappears upstairs. 
DONALD No, it's just good writing technique. (types, then:) (MORE)

EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY 
Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access platform onto the stern gate of the American ship. 
Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing his chance and lifting the first of his boys up. 
YURI (in Russian) Pull yourself up! 
Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate. 
(CONTINUED) 
Inside the ship, officers yell. 
DECK OFFICER (O.S.) To the lower decks people! 
The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close. Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot quite reach. 
Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding. 
YURI Oleg! Catch your brother! 
Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms. 
Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until he hits the rocks beneath. 
Oleg pulls his brother from above. 
INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
A SIREN blasts. Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck. A loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate. 
DECK OFFICER Boys, you gotta move. 
ALEC We wait for our father! He's still down there! 
The loading officer attempts to comfort them. 
DECK OFFICER There's no one down there. (GENTLE) Come on boys, come... 
The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt. 
The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap. 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
ALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors. 
ANHEUSER Why is the stern gate not closing? 
(CONTINUED) 
CAPTAIN MICHAELS Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) Captain, over here. 
They race over. Adrian points to a monitor. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) I think we found the problem. 
On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately waiting for Jackson and Lin. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) How did they get in there? 
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There... 
Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling along a wounded Lin. 
LAURA That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong. 
ANHEUSER You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean... 
Adrian tries to ignore this. 
ADRIAN Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber. 
Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura. 
ANHEUSER You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter? 
Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in the face. He drops to the floor, out cold. 
Everyone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian looks around. 
(CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN What are you all waiting for? 
They speed off. The countdown reads 0 min. 53 sec. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AIRFIELD/TIBET - DAY 
Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming force. 
EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY 
The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However, the props of the American ship don't move. 
In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering towards them. 
INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
An IMPACT WARNING sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew. One of the officers explains. 
TECHNICAL OFFICER If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start. 
ADRIAN There's no way to override it? 
TECHNICAL OFFICER No sir, it has to be done manually.

MCCULLOCH That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home. 
TAMARA But I haven't even shown you my biology project... 
Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as it softly piles at her bare feet. 
ANGLE - PORTHOLE WINDOW 
as the SHADOW OUTSIDE quickly blurs past the window. 
RETURN TO SCENE 
McCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react. Tamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning to unsnap, exposing her lithe body...but that's not all. Tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin. 
TAMARA Take a closer look, Charles. I want to make sure I labeled all my organs correctly. 
EXT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - STALKING POINT OF VIEW 
as we approach her door, still cracked open from McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly starched shirt. 
INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS 
as she holds him tight. He finally breaks away in a fit of anger. 
MCCULLOCH Oh, you've done it now. Not only are you going home, I'll see to it that you spend next year back in a high school classroom! 
He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to face with: 
WAYNE 
who casually lowers his camcorder. 
TAMARA I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch. (to Wayne) Did you get anything good? 
His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness. 
WAYNE Oh yeah. 
She quickly slips on her robe again, all business. McCulloch realizes what has just transpired. 
MCCULLOCH You'll never get away with it. (eyeing Wayne) And you can forget about ever attending any film school. (serious beat) You're both going to be very, very sorry. 
He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara steps over to him, cuddling up. 
TAMARA Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a thing. (beat) Can I have the tape? 
He pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch. 
WAYNE This is going to sound supremely lame...but I've had the major hots for you since our sophomore year, Tamara. 
He gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the incriminating videotape. 
TAMARA That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to chat but I'm really pressed for time. (ushering him to door) Let's try to get together later, okey- doke? 
WAYNE But I thought... 
TAMARA Thanks for the camerawork. 
And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands outside her room, realizing he's a major chump. 
WAYNE Wayne, you're an asshole. 
He despondently exits. 
INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME (STEADICAM) 
as Tamara heads for the bathroom, slipping off her robe. She moves to the shower curtain and we're right behind her. Her hand reaches up, grabbing the curtain, yanking it back... 
Nothing is there. 
INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT (EFX) 
as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the sink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked hair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face. 
When she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD POURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps, jerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR, SPLASHING IN WATER. 
RENNIE It's not real, it's not real... 
INT. TAMARA'S SHOWER - SAME TIME 
as water from the shower head SPLASHES CAMERA for a beat before Tamara turns it off. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body paint has been washed off. She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM. Just as she SCREAMS: 
INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME (EFX) 
Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, HIS FIST CRASHING THROUGH THE MIRROR. Right when Rennie SCREAMS: 
INT. TAMARA'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME 
The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a whimpering Tamara. 
TAMARA Please...please don't...

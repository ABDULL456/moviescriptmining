WEEMACK Kiss my ass. 
We hear a deep chuckle and the door, steel reinforced, swings open. 
INT. CASINO - COUNTING ROOM - DAY 
The two men enter, WeeMack nodding at the security man (ELRON). 
WEEMACK This is where they count the dough. You try to take any of it Elron there shoot your ass. 
Again the security man chuckles. WeeMack picks up some fast- food wrappers. 
WEEMACK ...This place is a fuckin' pigsty. You a pig, man, nothin' but a squeaky ol' motherfuckin' pig... 
Elron chuckles. He is an enormously fat man; his chuckles come from deep, deep in his chest. 
WEEMACK ...You got fuckin' Kocoa Krispies in ya uniform man, still got breakfast there and you eatin' motherfuckin' lunch. 
Elron uses one hand to swipe crumbs off his uniform shirt, chuckling. 
WEEMACK ...You a disgrace before motherfuckin' God... 
Elron chuckles. 
WEEMACK ...You a motherfuck-- oh, hello Mr. Gudge, how we be this mornin'? 
A man in a buttoned white shirt nods at him. 
GUDGE Funthes. How's the new man? 
WEEMACK He is a cleaning motherfucker, man! 
GUDGE Is that a fact. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE - SMOKING FIELD SET - DAY 
HIGH ANGLE 
It is a ruin of a field; charred trees point bare and gnarled limbs toward a gray sky; smoke drifts across the desolate waste. 
Something is bounding towards us from the deep background. We BOOM DOWN as it approaches: a bulldog, running avidly toward us on its stumpy little legs. 
An OFFSCREEN male voice (CLARK PANCAKE): 
PANCAKE (O.S.) One, Mountain! 
There is an explosion that showers dirt in front of the dog and makes it veer. Something strapped around the dog's neck bounces as he runs. 
PANCAKE ...Scrub two! Scrub three! Four, Mountain! 
Another explosion makes the dog veer back so that it once again bears on us. The thing that has been bouncing around its neck flies off. 
Our CONTINUING BOOM DOWN has brought us to ground level just as the dog arrives in front of us to feed at a dog food bowl in the foreground. The yellow plastic bowl has a K-Ration logo facing us. 
We hear another OFFSCREEN voice (DIRECTOR): 
DIRECTOR (O.S.) Cut, goddamnit. His canteen fell off. 
The Director's feet enter in the foreground. He hooks the dogs belly with one foot and hoists it roughly away from the bowl. We 
CUT UP TO: 
The DIRECTOR. He scowls down at the animal. 
DIRECTOR ...Props! 
A man in a Hemingway field-jacket with multiple pockets, and also a loaded utility belt, trots up toward him, his belt jangling as he runs. This is CLARK PANCAKE. 
Pancake is a florid beer-bellied man in his late fifties. He has a full blond-grey Grizzly Adams beard and wears multi- pocketed shorts that form an ensemble with his Hemingway jacket. 
The director is angry. 
DIRECTOR ...The goddamn thing's canteen fell off. It would have been a good take. 
Pancake is unperturbed. 
PANCAKE Okay. Okay. We're prepared for that... 
He hits a button on the radio on his belt and talks into his headset: 
PANCAKE ... Mountain, bring Otto with the apparatus. 
PULLING ANOTHER BULLDOG 
He strains at his lead, muscling forward as quickly as his minder and his own stumpy little legs will allow. 
He peers through the two goggly eyeholes of an antique leather gas mask, its pignose breathing apparatus covering his own snout. His phlegmy breathing is amplified by the device. 
We TILT UP the lead to show his minder, MOUNTAIN GIRL. She is a solid woman in her late forties with freckles beginning to merge into age spots. Her long straw-colored hair is tightly braided into Heidi pigtails bound with red ribbon. Otherwise her dress is unadorned. 
The director squints at the dog.

INT - COFFIN - NIGHT 
...and the lid wrenches aside to reveal the Creature. He peers down at us, almost close enough to kiss. 
EXT - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - ANGLE FROM ROOF - NIGHT 
The Creature nimbly climbs the outer wall, fingers grasping the brickwork, a dark shape slung over his shoulder. He pauses as a PAIR OF STABLEHANDS pass far below. He pulls himself onto the roof, crosses the gables, and pushes open a dormer window. We see Victor inside as it swings open. The Creature enters with his prize... 
INT - ATTIC - NIGHT 
...and the mottled corpse of Justine Moritz flops onto the table before us. 
TILT UP TO: 
CREATURE I want her. 
Victor stares down in utter horror. Her cold, dead face. Blue lips already beginning to shrivel. Purple, sunken eyes. 
Knowing that she loved him. Knowing it's his fault she's dead. He can barely get the words out: 
VICTOR Why... her? 
CREATURE Her body pleases me. 
That's it for Victor. He turns away, stomach heaving. It's all he can do to keep from throwing up. 
CREATURE Materials, remember? Nothing more. Your words. 
Victor hesitates, pulling himself together. Softly: 
VICTOR My words. 
He turns back, forcing himself to examine the body, trying not to view it as someone he knows. He cradles the head, probing the back of the neck with his fingers. 
VICTOR The brain stem was destroyed by the hanging. We'll need another. The body looks like it will do, but some extremities are too decayed. They'll have to be replaced. The fresher the better. 
EXT - ALLEY - RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT 
Outside the back door of a rowdy tavern, we find a PROSTITUTE servicing a SAILOR in the alley: he's got her pressed against the wall, skirt hiked up. It's not long before he's finished. Off he goes, staggering back into the bar. She arranges her skirt, tucking the money away... and pauses, noticing a TALL FIGURE in the shadows. Staring. She approaches with her best saucy smile: 
PROSTITUTE Want some yourself? Or just like to watch? (draws close) What do you say, lover? I can make it good for you. 
The Creature leans into the light, clamps a massive hand to her mouth. His other arm wraps around her waist, pulling her off the ground. She gazes up, eyes wide, screams muffled in his palm. Softly: 
CREATURE I know you can. 
And he wrenches his arm, snapping her spine. 
INT - ATTIC - NIGHT 
The dead prostitute lies staring up, dried blood staining her mouth. TILT UP to Victor gazing down in horror. 
VICTOR What is this? 
CREATURE A brain. Extremities. 
VICTOR This was not taken from a grave. 
CREATURE What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her. 
VICTOR No. I draw the line. 
The Creature lashes out and drags Victor across the table. 
CREATURE You will honor your promise to me! 
VICTOR (through gritted teeth) I will not! Kill me now! 
CREATURE That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours. 
The Creature vanishes out the attic window into the night. 
Victor is left gasping for air, staring at the dead prostitute. The full horror sinking in. 
INT - ATTIC STAIRCASE - MORNING 
Victor slams the attic door, securing it with a massive padlock. He hurries down the steps. 
INT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY 
Victor and Elizabeth, intensity flying: 
VICTOR No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today. 
ELIZABETH Why the change? What about your work? 
VICTOR It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?

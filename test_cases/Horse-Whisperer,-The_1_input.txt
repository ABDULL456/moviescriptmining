That was too much information for Annie; 
ANNIE Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive... 
LIZ Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain... 
ANNIE Well, of course, right... 
ROBERT What is it? 
LIZ (overlapping) We really shouldn't wait... 
ANNIE (overlapping) Hold on, Liz... (to Robert) Something about Pilgrim... 
The Doctor pokes his head in. 
DOCTOR (overlapping) Mr. and Mrs. MacLean... 
ANNIE (overlapping) -- put him down. She says... 
ROBERT (overlapping, to Doctor) Yes. Hi. (to Annie) Tell her you'll call her back. 
He exits with the Doctor. 
ANNIE Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so -- 
LIZ (interrupting) I understand, but Annie, please... 
ANNIE (overlapping) - See, what you can do for him --... 
LIZ (overlapping) Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same. 
ANNIE ... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is -- 
LIZ It isn't right to make him suffer... 
ANNIE And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem! (Liz is quiet) I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay? (softer) Please. 
Liz is stopped by Annie's almost pleading tone. 
LIZ All right... 
They hang up. Annie takes a breath. Robert re-enters. 
ANNIE What did he say? 
ROBERT Nothing new. He's just going off duty. 
Beat. Silence. 
ANNIE I'm going to get all the nurses' names... It's good to know all their names. 
Robert nods. But neither of them moves. They stand motionless for a beat, then Annie begins to break down and eases herself into Robert's arms. 
Robert embraces her, kissing her head, with an almost fatherly comfort. His expression tells us it's the moment he's been expecting... and wanting. Now she'll be all right, in his arms. Whatever distance between them, whatever problems felt insurmountable last night on the phone, are now, for the moment -- for Robert -- gone. 
But Annie's expression tells us something different. Her instinct to hold him was honest... but the effect isn't the same anymore. Something doesn't feel right. Something isn't working anymore about his comforting embrace. 
ANNIE I should go get some of her things. 
ROBERT No, let me go. 
ANNIE (gently pushing away) No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up. 
INT. THE UNIVERSITY ANIMAL HOSPITAL, RECOVERY STALLS - NIGHT 
A line of recovery stalls with various sick and hurt animals. Liz, exhausted asleep, on a chair outside a stall. There's a slight scratching sound. A hoof against the stall. It gets louder, awakening Liz. She gets up and looks inside the paddled stall: 
Pilgrim is lying in the stall, heavily bandaged. He is waking up. His first instinct is to kick at the paddled stall walls. He looks at Liz, his eyes filled with madness -- enraged to still be alive. 
INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM IN FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
Annie opens the door and enters, flicking on the light. Camera is on her back, as she places a small suitcase on the bed and opens it. She begins her task with cool efficiency. Opening drawers and closets, assessing what should be taken, what isn't necessary. 
Suddenly, she stops. She feels disoriented for a moment. She can't remember the last time she was inside this room. She takes a moment to pause and actually look around. 
In the light, we now see more of Grace's inner sanctum. Horse riding prize ribbons in various colors adorn the walls. Books. A girl's bureau cluttered with teenage possession ranging from childhood toys to items that suggest a reaching towards adulthood. Annie examines some items, affectionately. A GOOD LUCK CHARM from India sits among her things. Annie takes it to pack in the suitcase. 
She notices a framed 8X10 of Grace sitting proudly atop Pilgrim with Judith at her heel. She then notices the edge of another picture behind this one, in the frame. She pulls the Pilgrim photo out to reveal: An old 8X10 of Annie hugging Grace as a toddler. With her back to Camera, Annie remembers: 
MEMORY: 
INT. GRACE'S ROOM - A DAY REMEMBERED 
Annie is playing with toddler Grace. Chasing her around the room. Picking her and tossing her onto a small, toddler bed. Blowing into her stomach. Grace is laughing uncontrollably. 
END OF MEMORY 
Annie slides the Pilgrim picture back into the frame, then returns to her task of packing. 
INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Annie enters. No one else is there. She places the suitcase on a chair and opens it. She takes out the INDIAN LUCKY CHARM and some horse books, and places them on her bedside table. She takes care to prop up the Lucky Charm. 
She wets a cloth with some water from a pitcher and gently wipes Grace's sweaty brow... INSERT VISUAL FLASHBACK HERE, instead of in Country House. 
Annie then continues unpacking the suitcase. She opens Grace's closet and sees a hospital bag filled with Grace's clothes at the time of the accident. Annie examines them and discovers they are hers. Annie shoves the clothes into a bag and starts unpacking. 
INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - PRE-DAWN 
The Clock is ticking on the wall. The cafeteria is empty except for one tired Intern, drinking coffee on a break. 
Robert and Annie are having a cup of coffee. In the silence, they search for things to say. Until: 
ROBERT I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment... (Annie listens) I wanted to say something... (beat) But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter. 
ANNIE We're very lucky. 
ROBERT (nods) The funeral's on Friday. 
He rises and crosses to the self-help coffee dispenser as he continues... 
ROBERT Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...

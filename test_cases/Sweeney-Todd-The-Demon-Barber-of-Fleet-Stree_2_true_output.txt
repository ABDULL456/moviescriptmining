A shocked tremor through Todd -- as the Judge closes his eyes again and settles in comfortably... 
JUDGE And pretty as a rosebud. 
The music rises... 
TODD Pretty as her mother? 
JUDGE (mildly puzzled) What? What was that? 
TODD Oh, nothing, sir. Nothing. May we proceed? 
The music builds as he steps behind the Judge-- his razor ready -- we are sure the great moment has come -- the music still builds -- Todd finally puts the razor at the Judge's throat-- 
Then-- 
With an easy flick of his wrist, he just begins to shave the Judge, as: 
TODD Pretty women... Fascinating... Sipping coffee, Dancing...

Pretty women Are a wonder. Pretty women. 
Sitting in the window or Standing on the stair, Something in them Cheers the air. 
Pretty women... 
JUDGE Silhouetted... 
TODD Stay within you... 
JUDGE Glancing... 
TODD Stay forever... 
JUDGE Breathing lightly... 
TODD Pretty women... 
BOTH Pretty women! Blowing out their candles or Combing out their hair... 
They sing simultaneously: JUDGE Then they leave... Even when they leave you And vanish, they somehow Can still remain There with you, There with you. 
TODD Even when they leave, They still Are there. They're there. 
BOTH Ah, Pretty women...

TODD At their mirrors... 
JUDGE In their gardens... 
TODD Letter-writing... 
JUDGE Flower-picking... 
TODD Weather-watching... 
BOTH How they make a man sing! Proof of heaven As you're living-- Pretty women, sir! 
The music approaches a feverish crescendo as Todd prepares to finally kill the Judge and they sing simultaneously: 
JUDGE Pretty   women, yes! Pretty   women, sir! Pretty   women! Pretty   women, sir! 
TODD Pretty women, here's to Pretty women, all the Pretty women-- 
Just as the music reaches a climax, Todd raises his arm in a huge arc and is about to slash the Judge's throat when-- 
Suddenly-- 
Anthony bursts in-- 
ANTHONY Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna! She said she'll leave with me tonight--! 
The Judge jumps up, away from Todd-- 
JUDGE You! -- There is indeed a higher power to warn me thus in time-- 
He tears off the sheet as he advances savagely on Anthony:

JUDGE Johanna elope with you? Deceiving slut! -- I'll lock her up in some obscure retreat where neither you nor any other vile creature shall ever lay eyes on her again--!

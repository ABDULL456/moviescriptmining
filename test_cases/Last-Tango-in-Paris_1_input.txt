He really leaves this time. 
PAUL'S VOICE Rat's asshole with mayonnaise! 
He LAUGHS at himself. 
Jeanne is a BASKET CASE. She sits on her HAUNCHES, muttering. 
JEANNE I want to get out of here. I want to go. I can't stand it here any more. Yes. I'm going. 
She gets up, gets her purse and goes to the door. We see her ASS through the SHEER FABRIC of her wedding dress. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) I'm not coming back... ever. 
She gets to the... 
FRONT DOOR Paul is there, WAITING, NONCHALANT. 
PAUL Quo vadis, baby? 
JEANNE I forgot to tell you something. I fell in love with somebody. 
PAUL Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know, you're going to have to get out of these wet duds. 
He PATS HER ASS. 
JEANNE I'm going to make love with him! 
She opens the door but he closes it. She STOMPS into the HALL. 
PAUL Well, first you have to take a hot bath. Cos if you don't... 
He walks toward her. 
PAUL (CONT'D) ...you're gonna get pneumonia, right? Huh? 
She STOMPS a few more steps toward the BATHROOM. 
PAUL (CONT'D) And then you know what happens? You get pneumonia, then you know what happens? You die. And then, you know what happens when you die? I get to fuck the dead rat! 
He THROWS HER OVER his shoulder and carries her KICKING AND SCREAMING into the... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM 
Jeanne is in the BATHTUB. Paul sits on the BIDET behind her with a WASHCLOTH. 
PAUL Give me the soap. She does. 
JEANNE I'm in love. 
PAUL You're in love? 
He shoves her head UNDER THE WATER. 
PAUL (CONT'D) How delightful. 
She comes up ANGRY. 
JEANNE I'm in love! I'm in love, you understand? 
He SMACKS her with the washcloth on the head. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) I'm in love, I'm in love! 
He SHOVES HER under again. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Oh! I'm in love! 
He HITS HER on the head with her own shoe. She just gets more ANGRY. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) You know, you're old! You're getting fat. 
PAUL Fat, is it? How unkind. 
JEANNE Half of your hair is out and the other half is almost white. 
He smacks her in the mouth with the wash cloth, she smiles.

SHOT - DAY \nBackgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently tracking a target. Without interrupting this, he speaks with tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.) \n(In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build to an exciting crescendo). \nEXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY \nA group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.) \nINT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT \nThe microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates that it is 2:26 \nEXT. RUSSIAN BOMBER IN FLIGHT - (STOCK) - NIGHT \nThe plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage. \nINT. RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT \nThe radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his microphone and starts making a report back to his base in Russian. \nEXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT \nA group of French farmers is collected around a radio, listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in the sky. They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses himself. \nSPLIT SCREEN SHOT \nRIGHT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. AMERICAN RADIO STATION - DAY \nA breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his mike, but we can't hear what he's saying. On the wall behind him is a clock which reads 3:32. \nLEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION - NIGHT \nA clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it almost impossible to control his excitement. \nBRITISH ANNOUNCER Reports are coming in from all over the Empire -- from all over the world. The Government have not yet issued a statement, but there seems to be no question that there actually is a large, unidentified object circling the earth at incredible speed. \nThis announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and now we hear the words the American announcer is saying... \nAMERICAN ANNOUNCER (staccato with excitement) We still don't know what it is or where it's from \u0096- but we do know there's something there. It's been tracked around the world by radar traveling at a rate of four thousand miles an hour. \nINT. NEW YORK TAXI - DRIVER AND FARE \u0096 DAY \nThe driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, as we hear the voice of another radio reporter. \n2ND RADIO REPORTER (voice off scene) This is not another \"flying saucer\" scare. Scientists and military men have already agreed on that. Whatever this is -- it's something real. \nEXT. SUBURBAN GAS STATION \nThe attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's tank is overflowing. \n3RD RADIO REPORTER (voice off scene) We interrupt this program to give you a bulletin just received from one of our naval units at sea. \"A large object, traveling at supersonic speed, is headed over the North Atlantic toward the east coast of the United States.\" \nMusic builds to a climax and ends. \nINT. WASHINGTON RADIO STATION \n4TH RADIO REPORTER (with deliberately controlled calm) Here in the nation's capital, there is anxiety and concern, but no outward sign of panic. As a matter of fact, there are signs of normalcy that seem strangely out of place; the beautiful spring weather, the tourist crowds at the various monuments and public buildings... \nEXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK) \nA small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the columned entrance. \n", "test1_true": "Under this shot a barely audible, distant hum is heard. It grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two shots that we are unconscious of it. \nEXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK) \nEXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT \nCrowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the leisurely, meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers. \nMED. SHOT \nIncluding several small groups of people moving toward the Smithsonian. Their attention is attracted as the hum off scene becomes a roar. The sound is unearthly in its intensity and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume. The people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nSeveral people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned to look. There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes. The awful sound keeps increasing in volume. \nCLOSE SHOT \nA man, following the progress of a huge object in the sky with his eyes. He is held terror-stricken. \nLONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT) \nA giant shape, still at some distance, is approaching the earth at incredible speed. \nLONG SHOT ON GROUND \nA group of people run wildly across a large expanse of lawn. A huge shadow cast from above onto the grass seems to be pursing them. \nLONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT) \nThe great shape is considerably nearer now. \nCLOSE SHOT \nOf a woman, thoroughly shaken, held immobile by what she sees and hears. \nLONG SHOT \nPeople scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship comes in for a landing on a smooth, grassy area. The tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the great ship settles gently to a perfect landing. \nMED. SHOT - THE SHIP \nThe gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind -- no windows, no ports, not even the outline of a hatch. It is a fearsome, terrifying object, giving no evidence of its source or its intention. \nLONG SHOT - (FROM PARALLEL) \nShooting down on a section of lawn, showing the varying reactions of people to the landing. Some are still running madly away; others, singly and in little groups, stand as though rooted, staring at the ship from a respectful distance. \nCLOSE SHOT - MAN \nAs he stares at the ship with fascination and horror. He'd like to run but he can't. His mouth twitches and he emits a nervous little laugh. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nA woman is holding a two-year-old child by the hand as she watches the ship, awe-struck. Several people run past them. Suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob, turns and runs away. \nMED. SHOT \nA middle-aged man runs up to a group of several people, pointing wildly toward the ship and yelling irrationally: \nMAN They're here! They're here! \nHe runs off toward another group as we-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMONTAGE \nA series of short DISSOLVES showing: \n1. A man dashing up to a crowded Washington street corner shouting wildly and gesticulating in the direction from which he came. \n2. Policemen piling into squad cars, which roar out of their garage. \n3. Soldiers rushing out of a barracks at Fort Myer, with rifles and side arms, to form up on their company street. \n", "test1_id": 189, "test2_input": "EXT. MALL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT \nHurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building. Then she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance. \nMED. SHOT \nPANNING with Helen as she approaches the entrance fearfully. Rallying all her courage and determination, she forces herself to step inside. \nINT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nas she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building. She stops short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort. Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but she realizes she can't. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT -GORT \nHe has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly melting away. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nShe is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, whose legs are still held captive. \nMED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT \nas she moves slowly, fearfully toward him. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT \nThe plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly toward Helen. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nas she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him. \nMED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT \nAs the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the robot is closing in on her. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nHer eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream. \nTWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT \nas the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms outstretched as though to grab or smash her. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nAll hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver. \nHELEN Gort--! (with desperate clarity) Klaatu -- barada -- nikto. \nCLOSE SHOT - GORT \nHe pauses as he hears the words. His face doesn't change expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him. He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment. \nTWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT \nHelen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking toward the space ship. \nMED. SHOT \nPANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes silently behind them. \nINT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP \nCAMERA FOLLOWS as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted corridor into the main cabin, where he flips a switch that lights up the cabin. The robot proceeds to a small door leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside it. \nINT. SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT \nThis is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of mechanical noises. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nUnable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is gripped with a terrible fear. \nFULL SHOT \n", "test2_true": "EXT. SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT \nas the ramp comes down and Gort steps out. With grim, determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the building as the ramp silently closes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT \nThe Colonel who was in charge of Klaatu's apprehension is speaking into a phone at the desk of the Police Sergeant. Standing by are three or four Army officers, among them a Captain and a Lieutenant. \nCOLONEL (into phone) Yes, sir, we've got the body here now. Downstairs in a cell... No question about it, General -- he's dead all right... Yes, sir. Yes -- I understand. \nThe General has apparently hung up and the Colonel does likewise, turning to the officers in the room. \nCOLONEL General Cutler's coming down here right away. (to the Lieutenant) Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and post a guard around that cell. (to Captain) Captain, don't let anyone in or out of the building. \nThe two officers mutter their \"yes, sirs\" and start off about their business. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JAIL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nA squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching down the corridor toward a cell at the far end. \nINT. CELL - POLICE STATION \nThis is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption toward the body of Klaatu. \nINT. JAIL CORRIDOR \nHearing the sounds of clattering metal and mortar, the soldiers race down the corridor toward the cell. \nMED. SHOT \nshooting over the backs of the soldiers as they reach the cell and look inside. There they see the giant robot picking up the body of Klaatu and starting deliberately toward the gaping hole in the side of the building. They raise their weapons and fire at Gort, but the bullets have no effect on him. Continuing uninterruptedly, he steps over the debris and disappears, carrying Klaatu in his arms. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT \nas Gort enters the empty building, still carrying the body of Klaatu. CAMERA PANS with him as he strides over to the ship. The ramp opens and Gort goes inside. Then the ramp closes after him. \nINT. LABORATORY CABIN IN SPACE SHIP \nAlone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified. She looks up, startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's body over to a long counter. Once again he starts fiddling with knobs, switches and dials. As Helen watches, speechless, he starts to fasten strange-looking electrodes to Klaatu's wrist and ankle. \nEXT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT \nshooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the building, through a window into the main room where the Police Sergeant's desk is. The Lieutenant who was ordered to guard Klaatu's cell is excitedly reporting to the Colonel how Gort broke in and took Klaatu's body. Considerably agitated, the Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him. He and the Lieutenant cross to the door and CAMERA PANS with them as they come outside the building, hurry down the steps and get into a staff car. Several other Army vehicles join the staff car as it roars away from the curb. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT \nA good many of the 150 chairs are filled, and more guests are still arriving. There is no one to greet them at the door, so they wander in and seat themselves. \nINT. LABORATORY IN SPACE SHIP \nGort is still working over the body of Klaatu. From a socket in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the arm. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nas she watches, fascinated in spite of her terror. \nFULL SHOT \nGort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical cracklings and sputterings. Suddenly he flips a switch and all sound ceases. Gort removes the electrodes and watches Klaatu. CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu and we see him start to breathe. In a moment his eyelids flutter. Then his eyes open and he looks around. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nas Klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position. Helen watches breathlessly as he glances around the room, as though to orient himself. Then he lowers his feet to the floor and stands up. He blinks uncertainly, then smiles at them. \nKLAATU (with a grateful glance at Gort, he turns to Helen) Hello. \nHELEN (staring at him) I -- I thought you were-- \n", "test2_id": 190, "test3_input": "KLAATU (nodding, with a smile) I was. \nHELEN (looking at Gort in awe) You mean he has the power of life and death? \nKLAATU No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit. \nKLAATU (indicating the equipment Gort used) This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people. \nHELEN (concerned for him) But how -- how long--? \nKLAATU How long will I live? (he shrugs) That no one can say. \nKlaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a suit of his \"other world\" clothing from behind the panel. With a nod of apology, he steps behind the panel to change. \nEXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT \nshooting from the door. In f.g. Barnhardt, who has just arrived, is greeting several friends outside the door. In b.g. a staff car and three or four other Army vehicles are driving up. \nMED. SHOT - ARMY VEHICLES \nAs the convoy pulls up to a halt in front of the building, the Colonel hurries out of the staff car and moves over to Barnhardt. Barnhardt is motioning his friends into the building as the Colonel comes up to him. \nTWO SHOT - COLONEL AND BARNHARDT \nThe Colonel speaks to Barnhardt with deference but with unyielding authority. \nCOLONEL I'm sorry, Professor Barnhardt -- I have to ask you to call off this meeting. \nBARNHARDT Call it off? I... But I had permission from the Army-- \nCOLONEL I know you did. But the robots on the loose now and it isn't safe around here. You'll have to get your friends out of that building. \nINT. SPACE SHIP - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN \nas Klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he has changed into his \"other world\" tunic. \nKLAATU Gort and I will be leaving soon. \nHelen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and the knowledge that he is to die. There is a compelling warmth of feeling between these two. \nHELEN (simply, sincerely) We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I. (smiling to conceal her real feelings) He won't have anyone to play with. \nKLAATU He'll have you -- and Tom. \nHELEN (quietly -- definitely) No. That's all finished. \nKLAATU I'm sorry. \nHELEN (she is sensible and objective, but not unfeeling) I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it. \nKlaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration. Then he moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. Suddenly an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the building. Most of the chairs are already occupied, and latecomers are still moving in through the door. Facing the group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt. As Klaatu and Helen watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. His voice comes in the ship through a speaker. \nBARNHARDT Ladies and Gentlemen-- \nINT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT \nHe addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible disappointment in his voice. \nBARNHARDT I called you from your work and from your homes all over the world because we were to meet here tonight with a man from another planet -- the man who came here in this ship. (there are audible exclamations of surprise and disappointment) As you all know, this is no longer possible. I can only say that I share the bitterness of your disappointment. \nINTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots of the people in the meeting. They are the cream of Earth's intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders of social and political thought. There are several women among them. There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, several Negroes. All religions are represented. Every important world power is represented. \nINT. MAIN CABIN - SPACE SHIP \nKlaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker. Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the meeting and also Barnhardt's voice. At this moment Gort moves across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him. \nKLAATU Gort -- berengo. \nGort moves off obediently. \nINT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT \nFull of chagrin, he continues addressing the meeting. \nBARNHARDT --under the circumstances, the Army people have asked us to leave the building. And, since their concern is for our safety, I can do nothing but suggest that we comply-- \n", "test3_true": "MED. SHOT - BARNHARDT'S AUDIENCE \nas they react in startled amazement to the mysterious appearance of the ramp. Then, as they watch, there is a sudden gasp of terror. \nMED. SHOT - AT SHIP \nas Gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to the ground. In a moment, Klaatu and Helen appear at the entrance of the ship. Helen comes down the ramp to join Barnhardt, while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT COLONEL AND SOLDIERS \nThe Colonel stands near the door, flanked by a group of soldiers, their rifles at the ready. The Colonel is startled by what he sees. His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu and he's debating what he should do. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nHe is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld tunic. He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers, as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality. He turns to look out at the audience, which is held spellbound. Then, after a breathless moment, he speaks. \nKLAATU (straightforwardly, with almost stern authority) I am leaving soon and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly. (he pauses, studying the faces) The Universe grows smaller every day -- and the threat of aggression by any group -- anywhere -- can no longer be tolerated. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - IN AUDIENCE \nof three of the delegates, listening intently. (These three are from Russia, India and France.) \nKLAATU'S VOICE (over scene) There must be security for all -- or no one is secure... This does not mean giving up any freedom except the freedom to act irresponsibly. \nCLOSE SHOT - A DELEGATE \nHe is an American. \nKLAATU'S VOICE (over scene) Your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves -- and hired policemen to enforce them. \nCLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nKLAATU We of the other planets have long accepted this principle. We have an organization for the mutual protection of all planets -- and for the complete elimination of aggression. A sort of United Nations on the Planetary level... The test of any such higher authority, of course, is the police force that supports it. For our policemen, we created a race of robots-- (indicating Gort) Their function is to patrol the planets -- in space ships like this one -- and preserve the peace. In matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT \nemphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression. The normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably at the audience is his only movement. \nKLAATU'S VOICE (over scene) At the first sign of violence they act automatically against the aggressor. And the penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk. \nCLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nKLAATU The result is that we live in peace, without arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war -- free to pursue more profitable enterprises. (after a pause) We do not pretend to have achieved perfection -- but we do have a system -- and it works. (with straightforward candor) I came here to give you the facts. It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet -- but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder. \nQUICK REACTION CUTS \nof four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and bewilderment. And a cut of the Colonel and the soldiers, impressed and held by what Klaatu is saying. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nCAMERA MOVES SLOWLY as he concludes quietly, incisively. \nKLAATU Your choice is simple. Join us and live in peace. Or pursue your present course -- and face obliteration. (after a pause) We will be waiting for your answer. decision rests with you. \nBy the time he reads the last line, the CAMERA HAS MOVED INTO a BIG HEAD CLOSEUP. \nMED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES \nCAMERA MOVES along a row of their faces, stunned and silent, their minds unable to cope with the enormity of what they have heard. \nMED. SHOT \nCAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu as he is saying goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen. He turns then and speaks to Gort, glancing up at the building as he does so. \nKLAATU Gort -- veracto. \nCLOSE SHOT - GORT \nHe looks up at the roof of the building, and once again we hear the peculiar generating sound from within him. \nMED. LONG SHOT \nincluding the delegates, the space ship, everything that is inside the building. As we watch, the roof and walls of the temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did in the opening. The entire layout -- delegates, space ship and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a starry sky. The area is ringed with the debris of the building. \nMED. SHOT AT SHIP \n", "test3_id": 191}

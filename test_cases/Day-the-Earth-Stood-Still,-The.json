SHOT - DAY \nBackgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently tracking a target. Without interrupting this, he speaks with tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.) \n(In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build to an exciting crescendo). \nEXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY \nA group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.) \nINT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT \nThe microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates that it is 2:26 \nEXT. RUSSIAN BOMBER IN FLIGHT - (STOCK) - NIGHT \nThe plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage. \nINT. RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT \nThe radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his microphone and starts making a report back to his base in Russian. \nEXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT \nA group of French farmers is collected around a radio, listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in the sky. They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses himself. \nSPLIT SCREEN SHOT \nRIGHT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. AMERICAN RADIO STATION - DAY \nA breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his mike, but we can't hear what he's saying. On the wall behind him is a clock which reads 3:32. \nLEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION - NIGHT \nA clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it almost impossible to control his excitement. \nBRITISH ANNOUNCER Reports are coming in from all over the Empire -- from all over the world. The Government have not yet issued a statement, but there seems to be no question that there actually is a large, unidentified object circling the earth at incredible speed. \nThis announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and now we hear the words the American announcer is saying... \nAMERICAN ANNOUNCER (staccato with excitement) We still don't know what it is or where it's from \u0096- but we do know there's something there. It's been tracked around the world by radar traveling at a rate of four thousand miles an hour. \nINT. NEW YORK TAXI - DRIVER AND FARE \u0096 DAY \nThe driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, as we hear the voice of another radio reporter. \n2ND RADIO REPORTER (voice off scene) This is not another \"flying saucer\" scare. Scientists and military men have already agreed on that. Whatever this is -- it's something real. \nEXT. SUBURBAN GAS STATION \nThe attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's tank is overflowing. \n3RD RADIO REPORTER (voice off scene) We interrupt this program to give you a bulletin just received from one of our naval units at sea. \"A large object, traveling at supersonic speed, is headed over the North Atlantic toward the east coast of the United States.\" \nMusic builds to a climax and ends. \nINT. WASHINGTON RADIO STATION \n4TH RADIO REPORTER (with deliberately controlled calm) Here in the nation's capital, there is anxiety and concern, but no outward sign of panic. As a matter of fact, there are signs of normalcy that seem strangely out of place; the beautiful spring weather, the tourist crowds at the various monuments and public buildings... \nEXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK) \nA small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the columned entrance. \n4. Newspaper presses rolling at high speed. \n5. Newscasters chattering excitedly into their microphones. \n6. A large telephone switchboard with the girls in a frenzy of activity as they try to handle the calls pouring in. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BASEBALL STADIUM - LONG SHOT \nThe players are standing on the field in the crowded stadium, but the game has been interrupted and everyone is listening to the voice on the loudspeaker system. (Actual stock shot would be coverage of some dedication or ceremonial.) \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PENTAGON OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT \nA Brigadier General speaks in clipped tones into the telephone. There are a couple of other officers in the room. \nBRIGADIER GENERAL (into phone) Get me the Chief of Staff. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. U.S. SENATE OR HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (STOCK) \nA shot, if one is available, of either House listening raptly as an announcement of great import is read by the Chair. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT \nA distinguished-looking government official speaks into the phone with a sense of subdued urgency. \nGOVERNMENTAL OFFICIAL I want to speak to the President. (listens for a moment) I'm sorry -- you'll have to interrupt him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RADIO AND TELEVISION STUDIO - MED. SHOT \nA nationally known news commentator -- for purposes of this script let's say Drew Pearson -- is seated before a radio mike. He is also being photographed by TV cameras. In a wall near him is a TV screen which shows what is going out on the air. During the ensuing speech, a man comes in a hands him a sheaf of news bulletins. \nPEARSON Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this is Drew Pearson. We bring you this special radio-television broadcast to give you the latest information on the landing of the \"space ship\" in Washington. \nCLOSE SHOT - PEARSON \nPEARSON Government and Defense Department officials are concerned by reports of panic in several large Eastern cities. I am authorized to assure you that so far there is no reasonable cause for alarm. The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false. I repeat -- these rumors are absolutely false! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nPEARSON The ship, designed for travel outside the earth's atmosphere, landed in Washington today at 3:47 p.m., Eastern Standard Time. We still don't know where it came from, but I can reveal that military leaders are considering two possibilities; that it came from some unfriendly power here on earth -- or that it actually arrived from another planet. \nCAMERA PANS to and DOLLIES IN on the TV screen in the wall. On the screen is a shot of the space ship. \nPEARSON'S VOICE (over scene) The ship is resting exactly where it landed two hours ago, and there has been no sign of life from inside it. \nOUR CAMERAL HOLDS on the TV screen. The cuts that follow are inside the frame of the screen: \nEXT. THE MALL - MED. SHOT \nTwo platoons of infantry soldiers surround the ship, their rifles at the ready. \nPEARSON'S VOICE (over scene) Troops have been rushed from Fort Myer and they have formed a cordon around the ship. \nMED. SHOT \nshowing two machine guns, two Sherman tanks and two 75MM guns. The gun crews are posted for action and all weapons are trained on the space ship. \nPEARSON'S VOICE (over scene) They are supported by machine guns, tanks and artillery. \nMED. SHOT - POLICE CORDON \nCops are holding back a section of a large crowd, some distance away from the ship. The people are wide-eyed and tense with excitement. \nPEARSON'S VOICE (over scene) Behind police lines, there is a large crowd of curiosity seekers. \nSERIES OF INDIVIDUAL CUTS \nANOTHER ANGLE - THE TROOPS \nas they react to the full shock of what has happened. Most of them stand rooted to the ground. Several laugh hysterically. A few break and run wildly. \nMED. SHOT - CROWD OF CIVILIANS \nSudden pandemonium breaks out. Utterly terrified by what they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, screaming mob, concerned only with escape. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT \nHe is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot starts to reach out to grab him. \nCLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nlying on the ground. He speaks to Gort sharply, in a strange language. \nKLAATU Gort! Deglet ovrosco! \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT \nHe pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank commander. Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains that way. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nHe has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it are indications of small electronic gadgets. \nKLAATU It was a gift. For your President. (glances at the broken object ruefully) With this he could have studied life on other planets. \nKlaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding his wounded shoulder. As he does so, a colonel and a captain come into scene. \nCOLONEL (to the lieutenants) Is he all right? \nFIRST PLATOON LEADER Got hit in the shoulder, sir. \nThe three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making his decision. \nCOLONEL Send for an ambulance. Get him to Walter Reed Hospital right away. \nCAPTAIN Yes, sir. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SITTING ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nThere is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatu's room. In the small sitting room, talking in tones of hushed concern, is a group of men. There's a Major General, a likable man with a chest full of ribbons. There are also a Colonel in command of the hospital, a high-ranking police officer, a couple of medical officers and two civilians. The conversation is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatu's room of a Medical Corps Major, followed by an Army Nurse. \nGENERAL (to Major) How is he? \nMAJOR WHITE He's all right, General... Blood pressure's a little high, but it could be aggravation. \nGENERAL (wryly) Can't blame him. I always get mad when somebody shoots me. \nMAJOR WHITE He still wants to see the President. \nCOLONEL (to General) We informed the White House over an hour ago. \nGENERAL (to Major) Didn't drop any hints about where he's from, did he? \nMAJOR WHITE No, sir, he didn't. \nThe door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain enters. \nCAPTAIN Excuse me. (to the Colonel) What about the reporters, Colonel? They're swarming all over the lobby. \nThe Colonel turns, in deference, to the General. \nGENERAL (quietly) Tell them there won't be any statement tonight. \nCAPTAIN Yes, sir. (glancing down the corridor) Mr. Harley's here from the White House. \nHarley appears in the doorway, a brief case under his arm. He's a dignified, intelligent member of the White House secretariat. He proceeds uninterruptedly into the room, nodding cordially to the General. \nHARLEY General -- \nGENERAL (indicating Klaatu's room) Right in there, Mr. Harley. \nHARLEY Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible. \nHarley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by Klaatu's level gaze. \nHARLEY I must ask that you don't attempt to leave the hospital. Our military people have insisted on this. I'm sure you'll understand. \nWith a polite nod, he goes out. Klaatu stares after him as he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner. He shakes his head slowly, thoughtfully. The ways of this planet are strange indeed. \nINT. SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR \nHarley has paused to watch as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nAs he hears the click of the lock, he turns toward the door. Realizing they've locked him in, he smiles with tolerant amusement. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT \nIn the dim light of one lamp, the door to the corridor opens and a nurse enters carrying a tray of medication. She is accompanied by the same M.P. as previously seen. The nurse pauses as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door. To his surprise he finds that the door is not locked. He exchanges a glance with the nurse, then pulls the door open and hurries inside. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM \nas the M.P. crosses the unlighted room toward the bed. The only light cones from the open door to the sitting room. The M.P.'s eyes go wide as he looks at the bed. It is unmade and unoccupied. Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is standing in the doorway. \nM.P.  He's gone! \nThe M.P. dashes out of the room, through the doorway past the nurse. She turns to follow him as we-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMONTAGE - NIGHT \nA series of short DISSOLVES, showing: \n1. The M.P. excitedly reporting Klaatu's disappearance to the Officer of the Day. \n2. The hospital guard detail hurrying out of the guardhouse to form up in front of the Sergeant of the guard. \n3. A high-level military conference gathered at a table, discussing the matter with great concern. \n4. A street corner newsstand, with people eagerly grabbing papers. The headline reads: \"MAN FROM MARS\" ESCAPES FROM ARMY HOSPITAL! \n5. Radio announcers chattering excitedly into their microphones \n6. A series of close-ups of people listening to the radio. Their faces reveal their awestruck terror. \n7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT \nCAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost deserted, middle-class street. He carries a suitcase and he glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old two-story houses. As he passes, from the open windows of the houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up. We get the impression that everyone is glued to his radio. \nRADIO VOICES (over scene) --authorities at Walter Reed Hospital refused to comment on how he managed to escape, or what measures might be taken to apprehend him. \n--these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter. He is not eight feet tall, as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of arms-- \n--there's no denying that there is a monster at large -- that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and power. The public is urged to take ordinary precautions and to remain calm, as we await further developments-- \n--three separate reports of people who claim to have seen the \"space man\" in the past hour. One from Des Moines, Iowa; one from a village in northern Florida; and one from Chicago. \nCAMERA OVERTAKES the man as he pauses under the light of a street lamp, and reveals that it is Klaatu. He has stopped to look at something out of scene. \nCLOSE SHOT \nfrom Klaatu's viewpoint, of a sign on one of the houses, reading: ROOM FOR RENT \nCLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nHe seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind. He raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing. Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it. \nINSERT - TICKET \nINT. BOARDINGHOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY \nFive of the boarders -- Mr. and Mrs. Barley, Mr. Krull, Helen Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning breakfast. Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel Heater's voice. \nGABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE --and so, this Sunday morning, we ask the question that's been plaguing; the entire nation for two days now: \"Where is this creature and what is he up to?\" If he can build a space ship that can fly to Earth -- and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns -- what other terrors can he unleash at will? ...Obviously we must find this monster. We must track him down like a wild animal and destroy him. \nINSERT - NEWSPAPER PAGE IN MRS. BARLEY'S HANDS \nIt is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of space ships. Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth people with ray guns. The caption at the top of the image reads: \"Are We Long For This World?\" (Gabriel Heater's voice continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.) \nCLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nHe is reading his paper with considerable interest. \nINSERT - NEWSPAPER STORY \nThe third-page story reads: SAVANT CALLS MEETING TO STUDY SPACE SHIP. Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study the recently landed \"Space Ship.\" \nCLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nHis face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. This story seems to impress and interest him. Then suddenly he finds his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying. \nGABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE But where would such a creature hide himself? Would he disappear into the north woods? Or would he slither off into the sewers of some great city? \nKlaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously distasteful idea. \nGROUP SHOT \nAS THE RADIO VOICE CONTINUES: \nGABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE There is grave danger -- everyone agrees to that. The question is what can we do to protect ourselves? What measures can we take that will-- \nDuring the above, Mrs. Barley has turned to her husband in sharp annoyance. \nMRS. BARLEY George, I wish you'd turn that radio off. I'm trying to concentrate. \nMr. Barley reaches out and snaps off the radio. \nMR. BARLEY (snorting, he tosses his paper down) Why doesn't the Government do something -- that's what I want to know. \nMR. KRULL (mildly) What can they do? They're only people -- Just like us. \nMR. BARLEY People my foot! They're Democrats! \nMR. KRULL It's enough to give you the shakes. He's got that robot standing there -- ten-foot tall -- just waiting for orders to destroy us. \nHELEN (thoughtfully) This space man -- or whatever he is. We automatically assume he's a menace... Maybe he isn't at all. \nMR. BARLEY (glaring at her for this silly notion) Then what's he hiding for? Why doesn't he come out in the open? \nMR. KRULL Yeah. (indicating the radio) Like the fella says: \"What's he up to?\" \nHELEN Maybe he's afraid. \nMRS. BARLEY (with a derisive snort) He's afraid! \nHELEN After all, he was shot the moment he landed here. (she pauses for a moment thoughtfully) I was just wondering what I would do. \nKLAATU (to Helen, helpfully) Perhaps before deciding on a course of action, you'd want to know more about the people here -- to orient yourself in a strange environment. \nMRS. BARLEY (sharply) There's nothing strange about Washington, Mr. Carpenter. \nKLAATU (quietly, tongue in cheek) A person from another planet might disagree with you. \nMRS. BARLEY If you want my opinion, he came from right here on Earth. (with significant emphasis) And you know where I mean. \nMR. KRULL They wouldn't come in a space ship. They'd come in airplanes. \nMRS. BARLEY (as though with superior knowledge) I wouldn't be so sure about that. \nMR. BARLEY (delivering the final word) Stands to reason that fella wants some thing or he wouldn't be here. (facing Klaatu) That make sense, Carpenter? \nKlaatu pauses for a moment, then recites pleasantly. \nKLAATU I must admit I'm a little confused. \nBobby looks up at him in bewilderment. After a moment Klaatu speaks slowly, thoughtfully. \nKLAATU Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today? \nBOBBY (puzzling it over) Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess. \nKLAATU (secretly amused) I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker. \nB0BBY You mean the smartest man in the whole world? \nKLAATU Yes -- that would do nicely. \nBOBBY (after a moments thought) Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world. \nKLAATU (he pauses thoughtfully, speaks slowly, as he recalls the newspaper story he read) He lives here in Washington, doesn't he? \nBOBBY Sure. Right near where my mother works. \nKLAATU Where is that? \nBOBBY Department of Commerce. She's a secretary. (Klaatu nods) They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary. (after a moment; eagerly) Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship? \nEXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT - SPACE SHIP AND GORT - DAY \nA crew of Army engineers is in process of erecting a temporary structure such as a large Quonset hut or B29 hanger to enclose the space ship and Gort. The walls are partially up and already have concealed part of the ship. The area is roped off and there are Army guards to keep the sightseers back. There is a crowd of people behind the ropes, watching. CAMERA MOVES IN to reveal the backs of Bobby and Klaatu. \nTWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY \nBobby is studying the ship and Gort eagerly, his imagination thoroughly aroused. Klaatu is watching the men at work with mild, quiet amusement. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT \nfrom Bobby's viewpoint. \nTWO SHOT - BOBBY AND KLAATU \nBobby's eyes are wide with awe as he watches the giant robot. \nBOBBY Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building. \nKLAATU (with a quizzical smile) I shouldn't be at all surprised. \nBobby's attention shifts to the ship. \nMED. SHOT - SPACE SHIP \nFrom Bobby's viewpoint. \nTWO SHOT - B0BBY AND KLAATU \nBOBBY (excitedly, indicating the ship) Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go? \nKLAATU (quietly, after a glance around) Well -- atomic power, I would imagine. \nBOBBY (looking at Klaatu incredulously) I thought that was only for bombs. \nKLAATU No. It's for a lot of other things, too. \nBOBBY You think it can go faster than an F- \nKLAATU Yes -- I think so. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT KLAATU AND BOBBY \nshooting from a side angle to include a couple of men who are listening to Klaatu's conversation. They are nudging each other, amused at the way this man is pretending to explain things to the little boy. \nBOBBY About a thousand miles an hour? \nKlaatu has noticed the two men, who have edged a little closer to listen. He is not perturbed by them, but he lowers his voice a bit. \nKLAATU Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster. \nBOBBY (excitedly) Gee! How could they make a landing? \nKLAATU Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity-- \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - SECTION OF BLACKBOARD \nIt is covered with a particularly complicated series of equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, Keplerian ellipses, etc. The final equations are unsolved; they have no answers after the \"equals\" sign. Across are little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: \"Don't erase!\" and \"Don't touch!\" \nTWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY \nBewildered, Bobby looks from the blackboard up at Klaatu. Still studying the blackboard, Klaatu is shaking his head and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a child to solve a problem in arithmetic. \nBOBBY (indicating the equations) What does that mean? \nKLAATU It's a problem in celestial mechanics. \nBOBBY Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer. \nKLAATU (he shakes his head, smiling) He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way. \nBobby moves over to a pair of French doors beyond the window and tries to peer in through the curtained doors. He absently tries the doors and finds them locked. Then he turns away with a disappointed but philosophical shrug. \nBOBBY We probably couldn't get to see him even if he was home. \nAs Bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly, Klaatu puts his hand on the knob. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOBBY \nHe's watching Klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees. \nBOBBY (in complete surprise) Hey -- where you going? \nCHOOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nHe has opened the door and is standing in the doorway, his hand, still on the knob. He is smiling at Bobby with secret amusement. He's got an idea. \nKLAATU If he's that difficult to see, perhaps we ought to leave a calling card. \nKlaatu disappears into the study. Amazed, Bobby follows. \nINT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY \nBobby watches as Klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up a piece of chalk. As though correcting a schoolboy's work, he makes large check marks at several points in each equation. \nEXT. PORCH - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE \nAn efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing ajar. Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is HILDA. \nBobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( ). \nKlaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a stern voice is heard off screen. \nHILDA'S VOICE What are you doing in here? \nFULL SHOT \nas Klaatu and Bobby turn in surprise. Standing in the open French doors is Hilda, eyeing them with stern suspicion. \nHILDA (outraged by Klaatu's desecration of the sacred blackboard) How dare you write on that blackboard! (Klaatu eyes her mildly) Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks? \nKLAATU (pleasantly) He'll catch on to it in no time now. \nHILDA (controlling herself with an effort) How did you get in here? And what do you want? \nKLAATU We came to see Professor Barnhardt. \nHILDA Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening. (sternly) I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda. \nKLAATU You might keep this. (with easy assurance) I think the professor will want to get in touch with me. \nWith a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by Bobby. Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this stranger. Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections. At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his head in. Startled, Hilda drops the eraser. \nKLAATU (pointing to the blackboard) I wouldn't erase that. The Professor needs it very badly. \nAnd he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in impotent rage. Deciding that this man is either a crackpot or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts dialing a number. \nEXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT \nas Klaatu and Bobby come down the steps and turn into the sidewalk. They are talking and laughing together, but we can't hear their conversation. CAMERA PANS with them as they move on up the sidewalk, revealing two kids playing hopscotch. Klaatu watches, fascinated, as he walks by. Then, having passed the kids, he tries the one-footed, then two-footed hop that characterizes the game. \nKLAATU Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out. \nBOBBY (staring at them fascinated) Bet they're worth about a million dollars. \nKLAATU Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them? \nBOBBY (with a nervous, unsure smile) Well, sure, but-- \nThe boy studies Klaatu's face to see if he's kidding. Realizing that he's not, Bobby's face takes on a childishly shrewd expression -- as though he were about to trade a jackknife for an ocean liner. \nBOBBY (slowly) Okay. \nThe boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost challengingly. Klaatu takes the bills and hands Bobby two good-sized Diamonds. They study their new acquisitions with interest. Bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty glance at Klaatu. \nBOBBY Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter. \nKLAATU (mildly curious) Why not, Bobby? \nBOBBY (gravely) She doesn't like me to steal from people. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT \nShooting toward the curb as a police prowl car drives up and stops in front of the boardinghouse. A Detective in plainclothes gets out and gestures to the uniformed Driver to pull up the street a way and wait. The Driver nods and the car moves off as the Detective crosses the sidewalk to the boardinghouse. \nEXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs the Detective mounts the steps he glances through a window into the living room. Klaatu can be seen reading to Bobby, who is perched happily on the arm of Klaatu's chair. The Detective moves to the front door ant rings the bell. There is the sound of running feet and in a moment the door is opened and Bobby appears. \nDETECTIVE Mr. Carpenter come home yet? \nBOBBY (studying the man curiously) Yeah -- he's right inside. \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS - BOARDINGHOUSE \nDETECTIVE Tell him I'd like to see him. \nBOBBY (calling out) Mr. Carpenter--! (to the Detective) Come on in. \nThe Detective steps inside and Bobby closes the door, as Klaatu appears from the living room. \nDETECTIVE Your name Carpenter? \nKLAATU (puzzled that anyone should know him) Yes. (then recalling, with a smile of satisfaction) Oh -- I suppose Professor Barnhardt's looking far me. \nDETECTIVE (dryly, with grim emphasis) I been looking for you all afternoon. \nEXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT \nAn inexpensive convertible -- a 1948 Ford, or Chevrolet -- drives up and stops in front of the house. Helen and Tom are in it. \nINT. CONVERTABLE - TW0 SHOT - HELEN AND TOM \nYou get the feeling that Helen and Ton have spent a very enjoyable day together and are reluctant to say goodnight. Tom puts his arm around her and kisses her. \nHELEN (fondly) It was a wonderful day. \nTOM You still haven't answered my question. \nHELEN (warmly sincere) You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over. \nTOM The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents-- \nHELEN (smiling) You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it. \nTOM A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think. \nWith a smile and, a quick kiss, Helen gets out of the car. \nHELEN 'Night. \nMED. SHOT \nas Helen turns and hurries across the sidewalk to the house. In the entrance she turns and waves to Tom. He waves back and drives off slowly. Helen lets herself in with her key. \nTHIRD COP That'll be all, Mr. Baxter. Sorry to bother you... Next. \nCAMERA MOVES ON to a third desk where a small, rat-faced man is standing uneasily before the two cops, one of whom is flipping through a card file. \nFOURTH COP Cappo, John C? (the man nods) Two priors -- one for petty theft -- one for shoplifting. \nFIFTH COP (waving the man away) Okay, Jonny -- you can go. \nMAN (with a nervous grin) Sometimes a record comes in handy. (and he moves off) \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK \nA Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu, who stands beside the Detective who brought him in. The Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty, intelligent and businesslike. \nLIEUTENANT The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard. \nKLAATU I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem. \nThe Lieutenant exchanges a look with the Detective. \nLIEUTENANT (sardonically) Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out. \nKLAATU (pleasantly) That's right. \nLIEUTENANT (quietly sharp and accusing) I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army. \nKLAATU In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself. \nLIEUTENANT (growing impatient) But I suppose you know the answer. \nKLAATU (with a deprecating shrug) It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know. \nThe lieutenant shifts in his chair, annoyed that he has to deal with this madman. He glances at a report on his desk, trying to control his impatience. \nLIEUTENANT Your name's Carpenter -- that right? (Klaatu nods) Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number? \nKLAATU No -- I'm afraid not. \nLIEUTENANT Well, how do I know who you are? \nKLAATU (secretly amused) You don't. \nThe Lieutenant is turning away in exasperation as a uniformed cop comes into the scene. \nCOP Excuse me, Lieutenant -- (pointing offscene) The Doc says this man needs treatment right away. \nMED. SHOT \nA man about forty-five, bloodied and badly beaten, is being supported and half-carried by two policemen. A police doctor is guiding them to a doorway, near which is a sign INFIRMARY. The man is almost unconscious, incapable even of holding up his head. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK \nLIEUTENANT What's the story? \nCOP Some fella caught him lookin' in a window and figured he was the space man. The whole neighborhood went crazy and they ganged up on him. Would have killed him if we hadn't come along... Turns out he was just a prowler. \nThe Lieutenant grimaces his disgust and impatience with mob violence. \nLIEUTENANT Okay -- book him and get him fixed up. (the cops nods and goes, and the Lieutenant growls as he turns back to Klaatu and the Detective) Looks like everybody's goin' nuts. \nKLAATU (appalled by what he has seen and heard) They would have killed this man? \nLIEUTENANT (gruffly) People get hysterical enough, they do anything. (impatiently) Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army. \nKLAATU (pretending impatience, but actually growing concerned) How long will that take? \nLIEUTENANT They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital. (to the Detective) Take him over to G2. \nReally concerned now, Klaatu tries to find a way out. He attempts an authoritative air. \nKLAATU It's very important, Lieutenant, that I see Professor Barnhardt. \nDETECTIVE Come on, Mr. Carpenter-- \nShaking off the Detective's hand, Klaatu speaks to the Lieutenant. \nBarnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching him with a faint smile. Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying to adjust his mind. \nKLAATU (dryly) You have faith, Professor Barnhardt \nBARNHARDT It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity. (unable to conceal his interest) Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you. \nKLAATU (ignoring the invitation) I would like to explain something of my mission here. \nBARNHARDT That was my first question. \nKLAATU (with some bitterness) It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society. (gathering his thoughts) We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets. \nBARNHARDT Yes -- that is true. \nKLAATU In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people-- (he shrugs and shakes his head) We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power. \nBARNHARDT (puzzled) If you mean that you are afraid of us-- \nKLAATU (with cool impressive emphasis) We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years. (indicating the telephone) We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago. (he paces thoughtfully) So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate. \nBARNHARDT (thoughtful and impressed) These other planets -- do they have peace and security? \nKLAATU We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago. (he smiles wryly) After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos. \nBARNHARDT (with deep conviction) We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists. (Straightforwardly) What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu? \nKLAATU I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution. \nBARNHARDT Would you care to be more specific? \nKLAATU (evenly) What I have to say must be said to all concerned. (with a suggestion of deference to Barnhardt) It is too important to be entrusted to any individual. \nBarnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal to go any further. After a moment's thought, he speaks seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye. \nBARNHARDT I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful. \nKLAATU (sternly, as this unpleasant episode is recalled) I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin. (with Jovian annoyance) Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing? \nBARNHARDT (uneasily) What -- what sort of action do you mean? \nKLAATU Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand. (quietly) Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea. \nBarnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his hand across his brow. Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. After a moment, he turns to Klaatu. \nBARNHARDT Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples. \nKLAATU (quietly, evenly) That's what I came to see you about. \nBarnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily sheepish. But his own eagerness carries him on. He paces the floor thoughtfully. \nBARNHARDT It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world. \nKLAATU I leave that in your hands. \nBARNHARDT You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting? \nKLAATU No -- not at all. \nBARNHARDT What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police? \nKLAATU My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house. \nBARNHARDT (smiling, but a little concerned) I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy. \nKLAATU I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting. \nBARNHARDT (he suddenly pauses, thoughtfully) One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative? \nKLAATU (with a sense of quiet, inescapable power) I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be-- (he looks for the right word) --eliminated. \nThe implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, his keen mind reeling. \nBARNHARDT Such power exists? \nKLAATU I assure you such power exists. \nas Klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building, where there is a window. It has no glass in it but is heavily barred. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nas he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, grassy area surrounding the building. He stops and tries to see through the window. \nMED. SHOT - GORT \nshooting through the barred window into the building. The huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a couple of naked work-lights. His head is angled, away from the window. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nas Klaatu approaches the window. Aiming his flashlight at Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though signaling. (This should not approximate any known code.) \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT \nAs we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear on the wall ahead of Gort. Slowly, evenly, the robot's head turns to face the window. \nMED. SHOT \nfrom Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light flashing its signals. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nshooting on his back, as he finishes signaling and cuts off the flashlight. He turns ant starts back for the concealment of the foliage. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOBBY \ncraning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view. Suddenly he sees Klaatu again. \nMED. SHOT - KLAATU \nmaking his way behind the foliage toward the front of the building. Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu waits and watches. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BUILDING \nThe two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of relaxed alertness. Suddenly, inside the building behind them, the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway. His two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then back inside the building. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOBBY \nHe lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this. Bug-eyed, he glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu. He is amazed at what he sees. \nMED. SHOT \nfrom Bobby's viewpoint. Klaatu has emerged from the concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way calmly toward the entrance of the building. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOBBY \nAs he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the structure. \nINT. BUILDING - FULL SHOT \nas Klaatu enters. The huge shapes of the space ship and Gort loom large and eerie. Klaatu starts across the barren enclosure toward the ship. \nEXT. ENTRANCE TO BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nas Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated. He peers cautiously inside and his eyes grow wide as saucers. \nEXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT \nIn *f.g., near the door, the two guards lie unconscious. As Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to follow him with him with eyes. Klaatu touches a point on the unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings out and down to the ground. Klaatu mounts the ramp and disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently closes. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOBBY \nas he watches this; his eyes bulging. He can scarcely believe what he has seen. Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps over him. Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly away. \nINT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP \nCAMERA FOLLOWS Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted entrance corridor. He steps into the main cabin of the ship and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, shadowless light. The walls are lined with a complex of mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc. All of this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced engineering. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nas Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches and turning dials. Indicators light up. There are crackling, whirring and buzzing sounds. Klaatu starts speaking into a built-in microphone in his own strange language. He speaks in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHELEN (takes the stone and studies it, amazed by its size) Is it real? \nTOM (with the shrug of an amateur) Looks real to me. \nBOBBY Mr. Carpenter's got a lot of diamonds. (he digs into his pocket) He gave me a couple of them. \nHelen takes the two diamonds Bobby holds out in his hand, looking at them in amazement. \nHELEN He gave these to you? \nBOBBY (guilty for his own sharp dealing) Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars. \nTOM This doesn't make sense... I think the guy's a crook. I never did trust him. \nHelen tries to shush Tom, not wanting to re-stimulate Bobby's imagination, but it's too late. \nBOBBY Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler? \nHELEN (firmly) Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed. \nTOM I wonder if we ought to-- \nHELEN (cutting him off with a look) Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight. \nTOM (seriously concerned) You think it's all right for you to stay here? \nHELEN (nods reassuringly) I've got a good lock on my door. (smiling at Bobby) And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight. \nBOBBY Oh, boy -- can I, Mom? \nHELEN Yes, dear. Come on now. (she happens to look down at his feet. Puzzled, and concerned, she feels his shoes) Bobby, your shoes are soaking! \nBOBBY (reluctantly, with childish guilt) Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet. \nAs the impact of this sinks in, Helen and Tom turn to stare at each other in questioning consternation. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE BLDG. - MED. CLOSE SHOT DAY \nIt is a typical government office, with lots of desks in it. Helen is at her desk, straightening it up to go to lunch. This done, she moves briskly to get her coat. CAMERA PANS to follow her and suddenly, startlingly reveals Klaatu standing near the clothes rack, as though he had materialized out of thin air. Helen is thoroughly startled. \nHELEN (unnerved) Oh -- hello-- \nKLAATU May I see you for a minute? \nHELEN I -- I was Just going to lunch. \nKLAATU (quietly insistent) May I walk out with you? \nShe is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse. The telephone on her desk rings and Helen turns to answer it. \nHELEN (into phone) Mrs. Benson speaking. (recognizing the voice, she glances nervously at Klaatu) Oh, hello... \nINT. JEWELRY SHOP - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nIt's a rather swank shop. Tom is standing at the counter phoning. The Jeweler is behind the counter examining a stone through his eyepiece. \nTOM (into phone, cheerily) I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together. \nINT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nHELEN (with a nervous glance at Klaatu) I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye. \nShe hangs up and smiles uneasily as she rejoins Klaatu and leads the way out into the corridor. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TWO SHOT \nCAMERA MOVES with Helen and Klaatu as they go down the corridor. Klaatu's mood is one of quiet tension. \nKLAATU (watching Helen's reaction) I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school-- \nHELEN (glancing at him apprehensively) Yes--? \nA couple of engineers are working feverishly over a huge and complicated control panel. They are working by the light of two incongruous and ineffectual candles. \nINT. NEW YORK SUBWAY KIOSK \nPeople carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious to escape the darkness below.

BARNHARDT'S STUDY - DAY \nBarnhardt is seated comfortably at his desk with a book on his lap. He has been interrupted by the entrance of Hilda, his secretary. At the moment she`s beside herself with excitement. Barnhardt watches her with a half-smile of secret amusement. He has already deduced the cause of what's happening. \nHILDA You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself! \nBARNHARDT Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here. \nHILDA The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants! \nBARNHARDT (musing admiringly on Klaatu's cleverness) What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it. \nHilda flings him a questioning look, annoyed that he won't share her excitement. \nBARNHARDT What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived? \nHILDA (nodding) I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting. \nBARNHARDT Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter? \nHILDA (nodding) He'll be there at 8:30. \nBARNHARDT (studying her for a moment) Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure? \nHILDA Yes, sir -- it certainly does! \nBARNHARDT (nodding with a bland little smile) That's good, Hilda. I'm glad. \nHELEN (looks at her watch, then back at him, awe-struck) Yes -- Just exactly. \nSTREET - MED. SHOT - DAY \nShowing a section of street traffic as it comes back to life. From everywhere comes the sound of self-starters. Trolley bells start clanging. Then automobile horns.

LOBBY - DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE BLDG - MED. SHOT - DAY \nas Helen and Klaatu come out of the elevator and start across the lobby, CAMERA HOLDING ON THEM. Helen is preoccupied with concern for Klaatu's safety. \nHELEN Where are you going now? \nKLAATU Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about-- \nThis recalls to Helen something she had forgotten and she stops in sudden concern. \nHELEN No, wait a minute -- there's someone else. \nKLAATU Who? \nHELEN Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw. \nThe look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's overwhelming fear and uncertainty. \nHELEN (worriedly) Of course, he doesn't know anything definite. He'd talk to me first, anyway, before-- (interrupting herself in sudden decision) We can't take that chance. I'll get in touch with him right away and make sure. \nHelen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, followed by Klaatu, as we-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.

General Cutler? (disappointed that the connection isn't completed) All right, I'll hold on. \nRealizing what he's doing, Helen crosses to him, pleading wildly, desperately. \nHELEN Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved! \nTOM (exasperated) I don't care about the rest of the world! \nIt is as though he had slapped her across the face. Suddenly he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful. Feeling guilty as he sees the contempt and revulsion in her eyes, he tries the old charm, holding his hand over the phone. \nTOM You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers. \nHELEN (staring at him starkly) I feel different right now. \nTOM (uneasily) You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero! \nHELEN I'm not going to marry anybody. \nShe turns and runs quickly out of the room. Tom's inclination is to follow her, when his connection is completed. \nTOM (into phone) Hello, General Cutler? (irritated) No, I don't want to speak to his aide. I want to speak to the General. Tell him it's about the space man... My name is Tom Stevens. S-t-e-v-e-n- s. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MED.

I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me. \nHELEN Gort? (puzzled) But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do? \nKLAATU (slowly) There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth. (with great urgency) If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: \"Klaatu barada nikto.\" Please repeat that. \nHELEN (shocked and bewildered, she repeats nervously) \"Klaatu barada nikto.\" \nKLAATU (gravely) Remember those words. \nHelen nods, repeating the words soundlessly. \nSERIES OF CUTS \nof vehicle drivers reporting by radio as their eyes follow the progress of the taxi.

It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people. \nHELEN (concerned for him) But how -- how long--? \nKLAATU How long will I live? (he shrugs) That no one can say. \nKlaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a suit of his \"other world\" clothing from behind the panel.

SPACE SHIP - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN \nas Klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he has changed into his \"other world\" tunic. \nKLAATU Gort and I will be leaving soon. \nHelen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and the knowledge that he is to die. There is a compelling warmth of feeling between these two. \nHELEN (simply, sincerely) We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I. (smiling to conceal her real feelings) He won't have anyone to play with. \nKLAATU He'll have you -- and Tom. \nHELEN (quietly -- definitely) No. That's all finished. \nKLAATU I'm sorry. \nHELEN (she is sensible and objective, but not unfeeling) I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it. \nKlaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration. Then he moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. Suddenly an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the building. Most of the chairs are already occupied, and latecomers are still moving in through the door. Facing the group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt. As Klaatu and Helen watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. His voice comes in the ship through a speaker. \nBARNHARDT Ladies and Gentlemen-- \nINT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT \nHe addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible disappointment in his voice. \nBARNHARDT I called you from your work and from your homes all over the world because we were to meet here tonight with a man from another planet -- the man who came here in this ship. (there are audible exclamations of surprise and disappointment) As you all know, this is no longer possible. I can only say that I share the bitterness of your disappointment. \nINTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots of the people in the meeting. They are the cream of Earth's intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders of social and political thought. There are several women among them. There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, several Negroes. All religions are represented. Every important world power is represented. \nINT. MAIN CABIN - SPACE SHIP \nKlaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker. Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the meeting and also Barnhardt's voice. At this moment Gort moves across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him. \nKLAATU Gort -- berengo. \nGort moves off obediently. \nINT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT \nFull of chagrin, he continues addressing the meeting. \nBARNHARDT --under the circumstances, the Army people have asked us to leave the building. And, since their concern is for our safety, I can do nothing but suggest that we comply-- \n", "test1_input": "Harley is thoroughly shaken. The tremendous force and power implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of argument. \nHARLEY (after a long thoughtful moment) We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations. \nKLAATU Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State? \nHARLEY (helplessly, but patiently) Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table. \nGrowing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority. \nKLAATU I don't want to resort to threats, Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is at stake... I suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth. \nThe eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. Then Harley rises quietly. \nHARLEY I will make that recommendation to the President. (he picks up his brief case and hat) I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results. \nKLAATU (with a half-smile) Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are. \nHARLEY I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have. (he bows) Goodnight, sir. \nHe turns and goes out. \nCLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nHe stares after Harley for a moment, puzzled by this strange and apparently unreasoning world he has come to. He shakes his head in thoughtful, tolerant bewilderment. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SPACE SHIP - LONG SHOT - NIGHT \nSearchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space ship and Gort. A circle of soldiers guard the area, while a crew of men can be seen working around the ship. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - AT SHIP \nA Master Sergeant of Engineers, dressed in fatigues, is inspecting the side of the ship carefully. He has an acetylene torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face. The Major General, previously seen in the hospital sitting room, enters and speaks to the Sergeant. \nGENERAL Getting any place, Sergeant? \nSERGEANT (raising his helmet) No, sir. (shaking his head in annoyance) Beats me, General. I saw that ramp come out of the side of the ship -- right here. Now I can't even find a crack! \nA man named Carlson, a civilian metallurgical expert, comes into scene. The General nods to him. \nGENERAL What's the report, Carlson? \nCARLSON (discouraged) We've tried everything from a blowtorch to a diamond drill. \nGENERAL (nodding toward Gort) What about him? \nCARLSON He's made out of the same stuff. \nTHREE SHOT \u0096 GENERAL, CARLSON AND SERGEANT \nGENERAL Has he moved? \nSERGEANT No sir. Not an inch \nCARLSON This is the toughest material I ever saw, General. For hardness and strength, it's out of this world. \nGENERAL (with a wry half-smile) I can tell you officially -\u0096 that's where it came from. \nThe two men exchange an uneasy glance, then turn to look at the ship. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SITTING ROOM \u0096 WALTER REED HOSPITAL \nTwo Medical Corps officers, a Captain and a Major are interestedly studying a series of X-ray films. \nMAJOR The skeletal structure is completely normal. (pointing) Same for the major organs -\u0096 heart, liver, spleen, kidneys. \nCAPTAIN And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure. (nodding, toward Klaatu's room) How old do you think he is? \nMAJOR Oh, I'd say forty-five. \nCAPTAIN (smiling) He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight. \n", "test1_true": "CAPTAIN Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty. \nMAJOR How does he explain that? \nCAPTAIN He says their medicine is that much more advanced. (the major stares at him blankly) He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor. \nThe door to Klaatu's rooms opens and Major White appears. He's the man who attended Klaatu the day before. He closes the door behind him and stands motionless facing the other two, his face wearing a blank expression. \nMAJOR WHITE I took a bullet out of that man's arm yesterday. \nFIRST MAJOR What about it? \nMAJOR WHITE (utterly bewildered) I just examined the wound and it's all healed. \nFIRST MAJOR What does he say about it? \nMAJOR WHITE Said he put some salve on it -- some stuff he had with him. (shows them a small, odd-looking tube in his hand) \nCAPTAIN What are you going to do with it? \nMAJOR WHITE Take it downstairs and have it analyzed. (on his way to the door, shaking his head) Then I don't know whether I'll just get drunk or give up the practice of medicine. \nAs he starts out the door to the corridor, he passes Mr. Harley, who is on his way in, carrying his ever-present brief case. Harley is accompanied by an enlisted M.P. \nFIRST MAJOR Afternoon, Mr. Harley. \nHARLEY Afternoon, gentlemen. \nHarley goes to the door of Klaatu's room, a businesslike expression on his face. He knocks on the door, then enters. The M.P. remains in the sitting room. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT - DAY \nas Harley enters. Klaatu is up out of bed, walking around in a Medical Corps robe and pajamas. He appears to be completely recovered. \nHARLEY Good afternoon. (surprised not to find him in bed) I'm glad to see you up and around. \nKLAATU Thank you... Have you any news? \nHARLEY Not very good news, I'm afraid. (digs into his briefcase for some papers) The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night. (grimly) Let me read you some of the replies. (he selects a cable and reads) \"The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow.\" (with a grimly-pointed glance at Klaatu, Harley reads another cable) \"The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington.\" (he looks up at Klaatu and shrugs) Well -- there you have it. \nHarley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatu's inspection, but he ignores them. Klaatu has listened to this recital, first incredulously, then with mounting indignation. Conscious of his quiet, Olympian wrath, Harley continues uncomfortably. \nHARLEY I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust-- (uneasily, under Klaatu's level gaze) Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power-- \nKLAATU It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world. \nHARLEY Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President \nKLAATU (sternly) I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations. (sharply, bitterly) I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions. \nHARLEY Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly. \nKLAATU I can judge only by what I see. \nHARLEY Your impatience is quite understandable. \nKLAATU (sharply) I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it. \nHARLEY (ruefully) I'm afraid my people haven't. (with real sincerity) I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise. \nReluctantly Harley has picked up his hat and brief case. He finds Klaatu staring out the window. \nCLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nAs he looks out the window thoughtfully. What he sees has given him an idea. \nMED. SHOT - HOSPITAL GROUNDS \nshooting down, from Klaatu's viewpoint, at people strolling about the hospital grounds. Most of them are civilian visitors, but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory patients. \nFULL SHOT - HOSPITAL ROOM \nAs Klaatu turns back to Harley, he speaks thoughtfully, incisively. \nKLAATU Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes. \n", "test2_input": "HELEN (in explanation) I was talking to Mr. Carpenter. \nTOM (lightly, but with real sarcasm underneath) I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding. \nHelen tries to shush him, to indicate Klaatu is in the next room, when Klaatu appears in the doorway. He must have heard Tom's remark, and there is an awkward moment. Klaatu is completely unperturbed, but Helen is embarrassed. \nKLAATU Excuse me. I was just going up to my room. \nHELEN (guiltily) Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter. \nKlaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly. \nKLAATU Have a good time -- both of you. \nHe goes on up the stairs. Helen steers Tom toward the living room. \nHELEN Why don't you wait in here while I get my things? \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nAs they enter from the hall, Helen turns to Tom reproachfully. \nHELEN (quietly) Oh, Tom, that was awful. \nTOM (momentary apologetic) I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter. (Helen shushes him) I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him? \nThis touches on Helen's own private doubts, and she cannot answer. \nHELEN I'll go get my things. \nShe turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the stairs. Tom looks after her, dismissing the matter with a shake of the head and a philosophical sigh. Of such stuff are women made. \nINT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY \nHelen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and grabs a coat off the bed. She's putting it on as she moves down the hall to Bobby's room, the door of which is open. \nINT. BOBBY'S ROOM \nBobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him, as Helen enters, still putting on her coat. \nKLAATU (about to leave) All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract. \nBOBBY Thanks, Mr. Carpenter. \nKLAATU (to Helen, pleasantly) I'll say goodnight again. \nHelen is embarrassed. She would like to apologize for the awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go about it. \nHELEN Mr. Carpenter, I-- (it's too complicated; she can't do it) Goodnight. \nKLAATU (with a warm smile of complete understanding and appreciation) Goodnight, my dear. \nHe turns and goes out, closing the door. A little distracted, Helen turns to Bobby. \nHELEN Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning. \nBOBBY Okay. \nHelen watches as he starts to put away his work. She wants to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say. \nHELEN (hesitantly, almost guiltily) Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter \nBOBBY (shocked, and bewildered) Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt. \nHELEN Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt? \nBOBBY Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic. \nHelen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's story. Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret. \nBOBBY (shrewdly) Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter? \nHELEN What do you mean, dear? \nBOBBY I mean -- on account of that policeman last night. (his eyes light up hopefully) You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster? \n", "test2_true": "With a reassuring smile, she starts for the door. \nBOBBY Goodnight. (stopping her in the doorway, his imaginative suspicions mounting) Hey Mom -- why would he want to be alone? \nNot wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a kiss and backs out, closing the door. Bobby stands thinking for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu appears. \nKLAATU Bobby -- have you a flashlight? \nBOBBY (surprised by his appearance and his request) Yeah -- sure. (he goes to a drawer and gets a large hand flashlight) It's a real Boy Scout flashlight. \nBobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager curiosity. \nBOBBY What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter? \nKLAATU (evasively) Why -- the light in my room went out. (cutting off further questions) Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight. \nKlaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. Bobby hesitates a moment, puzzled and curious. Then he goes over to the door, flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door a crack so he can peer out into the hall. \nMED. SHOT \nshooting down the hall through the crack in Bobby's door. \nKlaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room can be seen burning brightly. Klaatu goes to his door, reaches in and flips off the lights and closes the door. He then scans the hall in both directions. Satisfied he isn't seen, he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, still carrying the flashlight. \nMED CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY \nas he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense excitement on his face. What he has seem is certainly, unmistakably suspicious. Why did Mr. Carpenter lie to him? What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? Bobby decides he's got to find out. Hurriedly he laces on the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find the hall clear. He slips out the door, closing it behind him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT \nKlaatu is walking down the dark, semi-deserted street with the determined stride of a man with a definite objective. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY \nHalf a block behind, he's following Klaatu, eagerly, flushed with a sense of excitement and adventure. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER - NIGHT \nWalking along the sidewalk, Klaatu turns into a side street, disappearing from view around the corner. In a moment, Bobby hurries into scene breathlessly. He pulls up for a moment to rest. Then, getting his breath, he dashes on around the corner after Klaatu. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LARGE TEMPORARY BUILDING - LONG SHOT - NIGHT \nThis is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose the space ship and Gort. In front of the one small door are two soldiers, standing guard. Concealed in some foreground foliage, studying the layout, is Klaatu. Nearby 's a sign reading: KEEP OUT! This area OFF LIMITS to the public. U.S. ARMY. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOBBY \nHe is a short distance away, watching Klaatu eagerly. \nCLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nas he studies the situation. \nMED. SHOT \nshooting over Klaatu's shoulder. As he watches, a Jeep filled with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives up to the entrance of the building. They stop for a moment while their Sergeant checks with the guards. Assured that everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver and the Jeep moves off. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU \nScanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking for. Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the foliage. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOBBY \npuzzled and interested, as he watches Klaatu. \nMED.

Rallying all her courage and determination, she forces herself to step inside. \nINT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nas she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building. She stops short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort. Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but she realizes she can't. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT -GORT \nHe has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly melting away. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nShe is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, whose legs are still held captive. \nMED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT \nas she moves slowly, fearfully toward him. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT \nThe plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly toward Helen. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nas she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him. \nMED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT \nAs the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the robot is closing in on her. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nHer eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream. \nTWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT \nas the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms outstretched as though to grab or smash her. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nAll hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver. \nHELEN Gort--! (with desperate clarity) Klaatu -- barada -- nikto. \nCLOSE SHOT - GORT \nHe pauses as he hears the words. His face doesn't change expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him. He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment. \nTWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT \nHelen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking toward the space ship. \nMED. SHOT \nPANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes silently behind them. \nINT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP \nCAMERA FOLLOWS as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted corridor into the main cabin, where he flips a switch that lights up the cabin. The robot proceeds to a small door leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside it. \nINT. SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT \nThis is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of mechanical noises. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELEN \nUnable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is gripped with a terrible fear. \nFULL SHOT \n", "test3_true": "EXT.

POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT \nThe Colonel who was in charge of Klaatu's apprehension is speaking into a phone at the desk of the Police Sergeant. Standing by are three or four Army officers, among them a Captain and a Lieutenant. \nCOLONEL (into phone) Yes, sir, we've got the body here now. Downstairs in a cell... No question about it, General -- he's dead all right... Yes, sir. Yes -- I understand. \nThe General has apparently hung up and the Colonel does likewise, turning to the officers in the room. \nCOLONEL General Cutler's coming down here right away. (to the Lieutenant) Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and post a guard around that cell. (to Captain) Captain, don't let anyone in or out of the building. \nThe two officers mutter their \"yes, sirs\" and start off about their business. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JAIL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nA squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching down the corridor toward a cell at the far end. \nINT. CELL - POLICE STATION \nThis is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption toward the body of Klaatu. \nINT.

She looks up, startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's body over to a long counter. Once again he starts fiddling with knobs, switches and dials. As Helen watches, speechless, he starts to fasten strange-looking electrodes to Klaatu's wrist and ankle. \nEXT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT \nshooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the building, through a window into the main room where the Police Sergeant's desk is. The Lieutenant who was ordered to guard Klaatu's cell is excitedly reporting to the Colonel how Gort broke in and took Klaatu's body. Considerably agitated, the Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him. He and the Lieutenant cross to the door and CAMERA PANS with them as they come outside the building, hurry down the steps and get into a staff car. Several other Army vehicles join the staff car as it roars away from the curb. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED.

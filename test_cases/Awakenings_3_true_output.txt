28.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER - DAY The files spread out on a table. Sayer and Miss Costello leafing through them.                    . Sayer considers one's original admission forms. He scans bodies of text and finds a diagnosis -- ATYPICAL SCHIZOPHRENIA. He sets it aside and picks up another. MISS COSTELLO "Atypical Hysteria," this one. Sayer nods to himself and keeps reading his. He eventually finds in its text -- ATYPICAL RABIES. He flips to the end of the file. "No change since last examination" it reads. He turns the page. "No change, no therapy recommended." He turns the page, the last entry. "No change." The date, "11/9/44." SAYER There must be more recent files we missed somehow. "Part Twos" to their medical histories. (Miss Costello is shaking head 'no.') In some other filing cabinet somewhere.                 . .. MISS COSTELLO NO.

SAYER One would think that after a point enough atypical somethings would amount to a typical something. But a typical "what?" Miss Costello, no doubt, has less of an idea than Sayer what the "what" could be. MISS COSTELLO ,            Doctor . . . would you like      to g e t a cup of coffee somewhere? (pause) Tea? SAYER Ah . . . normally I'd say yes . . . only I've made other plans . . . She nods quickly.    She seems, strangely, relieved. MISS COSTELLO Some other time. SAYER Yes. MISS COSTELLO Good night. SAYER Good night. They veer apart to their respective cars.

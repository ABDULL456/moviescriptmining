ALICE turns.  BILL is halfway out the door. 
ALICE (continuing) I'll go with you. 
BILL shrugs. 
BILL If it'll make you feel better.

99    INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 
The rain continues as they drive along. 
TIERNEY Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th.  They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon.  It affects people.  Makes 'em nuts. 
STEVE You've made a science out of coincidence. 
The police radio, which has been on "squelch," comes on. 
DISPATCHER #1 (V.O.) (filtered) Sgt. Tierney, Report. 
DISPATCHER #2 (V.O.) (filtered) Need a clear frequency... 
DISPATCHER #1 (V.O.) (filtered) Sgt. Tierney, car niner. 
TIERNEY takes the mike. 
TIERNEY This is Tierney. 
DISPATCHER #2 (V.O.) (filtered) Rescue squad with jaws of life... near mile marker 17... possible fatals... three, maybe more... head on... at least one trapped... 
DISPATCHER #1 (V.O.) (filtered) Sgt. Tierney, there's a bad accident. One fatality known, several possibles near mile marker 17 on the Interstate. Bus, tractor trailer.  Over. 
TIERNEY Roger.  Acknowledge receipt.  Estimate arrival time fifteen minutes.  How copy? 
TIERNEY has jammed on his brakes and swung the car around. 
DISPATCHER #1 (V.O.) (filtered) 100%.  I'll tell 'em you'll be there in fifteen minutes.  Out. 
TIERNEY bangs the mike down on the holder.  He stops the car. 
TIERNEY Have to drop you here, Steve. 
STEVE Sure. 
STEVE gets out quickly. 
STEVE (continuing) Good luck. 
TIERNEY Another coincidence. 
STEVE Yeah. 
CUT TO: 
100    EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT 
STEVE turns as the cop's car door slams.  TIERNEY peels out on the wet road. 
CU as STEVE watches the lights grow dim in the distance. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  as STEVE turns and jogs the other way.  Low thunder rolls in the distance.

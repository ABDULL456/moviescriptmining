SOAP How the fuck should I know? 
TOM How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?] 
The end of this joke is interrupted by a van swerving past them, dangerously close. The lads lodge a complaint and then they stop outside Ed and Bacon's so that they can pick up the money.

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY 
BACON What has been going on here? 
They look into a smoking, blood-covered house. 
SOAP The money, the gear! 
TOM That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses. 
SOAP OK, don't panic; let's think about this. 
EDDY Bollocks! You can think about it for as long as you like. I am panicking and I am off mate. 
INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY 
Big Chris is about to walk in to Hatchet's office. The door opens and out walks John O'Driscoll with a serious sunburn. 
BIG CHRIS Hello, John. Nice holiday? 
JOHN O'DRISCOLL I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny. 
BIG CHRIS I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John. 
HATCHET (off) That you, Chris? 
INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY 
HATCHET How did you get your hands on these? 
He drops a vagina-shaped penis massager, realising that these are the guns he has been after. He then tries desperately to conceal his excitement. 
BIG CHRIS The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them? 
HATCHET Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em. 
BARRY Was it any trouble getting the money? 
BIG CHRIS Well, not especially, but they seem to of upset a few characters. 
HATCHET Have you counted the money? 
BIG CHRIS Yeah, it's all there, to the pound. 
HATCHET They were going to pay, then? 
BIG CHRIS It looks like ?, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there. 
HATCHET Good job, Chris. 
Chris exits, pushing his wages into his inside packet. Harry is ecstatic about the guns and starts chuckling to himself.

SWEDEN - DAY                                               1 \nA Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings - \n2    EXT. CABIN - ESTABLISHING                                   A2 \n2    INT. CABIN - LAKE SILJAN - DAY                                  2 An elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin - a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver. \nMORELL What kind is it? \nVANGER O/S I don't know.    White. \nMORELL And the frame? \nVANGER O/S Dark. \nMORELL Postmark? \nVANGER O/S Same as last time. \nMORELL No note. \nVANGER O/S No. \nHe comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette. Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain. Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life. \nTV NEWSCASTER V/O Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600 thousand SKE in damages and all court costs, which could be significantly more. \nHe takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it, finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket. \n7   EXT. MILLENNIUM OFFICES, STOCKHOLM - DAY - ESTABLISHING       7 8   INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - DAY                               8 \nHe comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly- young staff. They try not to regard him as a dead-man- walking, but aren't entirely successful. He enters the editor's office. \nERIKA Where you been? \nErika Berger is about Blomkvist's age, and - like the IKEA furniture - sends a mixed message: a feminist in a mini-skirt. \nBLOMKVIST Walking.    Thinking. \nERIKA Smoking? \nBLOMKVIST Just one. He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair. ERIKA TV4 called. I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety. \nBLOMKVIST I have.    Who else? ERIKA Everyone who's ever wanted to see you humiliated. BLOMKVIST You've been on the phone all day then. \nERIKA I'm as much to blame for this as you. \nBLOMKVIST You are?    You wrote it? ERIKA I read it.    I ran it. \nBLOMKVIST Not the same. ERIKA Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael. \nBLOMKVIST Mine is. They regard each other in another silence.      Then - \nARMANSKY In every way. 13   INT. MILTON SECURITY - STOCKHOLM - SAME TIME - DAY          13 \nThe black-clad figure - from behind again - strides past coworkers who look away. \n14   INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - CONTINUED              14 SECRETARY/INTERCOM Ms. Salander's here. \nArmansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom button twice to say `okay, let her in.' \nLisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic- looking waif in her early 20's. Short black-dyed hair - pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably several more under her black leather jacket - black t- shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots. \nFrode is only middlingly successful in concealing his initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me. \nARMANSKY Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode. FRODE How do you do? \nShe doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him: \nSALANDER Something wrong with the report? FRODE No. It seems quite thorough. There's a wealth of data here. But I'm also interested to know what's not in it. \nSALANDER There's nothing not in it. \nFRODE Your opinion of him isn't. \nSALANDER I'm not paid to give my opinion. \nFRODE So you don't have one? \nSalander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually - SALANDER He's clean.   In my opinion. \nFRODE He's - excuse me? \nSalander offers nothing more. \nFRODE So. Nothing else. In the personal department. You're sure. \nSALANDER (pause) He likes sandwiches. A15   EXT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING                A15 \n15    INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        15 Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika - in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather jacket. \nShe wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half- eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it. \nERIKA Usually when I wake up in a cold bed, it's at home. \nBLOMKVIST Sorry. \nERIKA What are you doing? \nBLOMKVIST Writing the press release. \nERIKA Saying - BLOMKVIST You're taking over as publisher. You're sorry for any nuisance Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be reached for comment. \nERIKA You're giving up. BLOMKVIST Just taking a few steps aside. For you. ERIKA This makes me sick. 16    OMIT:   INT. BOOKSTORE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                  16 \n17    INT. MCDONALD'S - STOCKHOLM - DAY                         17 \nSalander sits alone at a table waiting for someone with a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a Christmas bow, the price tag still on it, a paperback book - My 60 Memorable Games, by Bobby Fischer. She notices the price tag is still on it. Peels it off. Dials a call on her cell. Hangs up when it goes to voice mail. \nA18   EXT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING                 A18 18    INT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - DAY               18 \nShe knocks on a door. Hears classical music playing softly inside, but no one answers. She tries the door. It's unlocked. The gift in hand, she pushes it open. \nDOCTOR V/O He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging. Either from the fall itself, or a stroke that led to the fall. His blood pressure is still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured. And it's possible, if he does, there will be neurological damage. \n22   OMIT:   INT. METRO - MOVING - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT             22 \n23   INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT              23 \nThey're around the dinner table now, passing platters around. Blomkvist notices his daughter's head is bowed in silent prayer. \nBLOMKVIST Nilla?    What are you doing? PERNILLA Nothing. \nBLOMKVIST (pause) You're not serious. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ \nPERNILLA I don't want to talk about it since I know you won't approve. \nBLOMKVIST Of - (she doesn't say) Nilla. PERNILLA Light of Life. \nBLOMKVIST Light of - what? (she doesn't repeat it) What is that? \nPERNILLA You think it's all senseless but it isn't. It's more natural to believe in something than not to. \nShe begins eating. Blomkvist stares at her, feeling a little sick. A cell phone rings. No one can tell - as you never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out. It's Blomkvist's. BLOMKVIST Excuse me. Looking back at his daughter with some concern, he steps away to take the call. \nBLOMKVIST Hello. FRODE O/S Mr. Blomkvist? \nBLOMKVIST Yes. \nFRODE O/S Forgive me for intruding on your Christmas. My name is Dirch Frode. I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of (him) - \nBLOMKVIST Of course. FRODE O/S He'd like to speak to you about a private matter. \nBLOMKVIST And last, I'm sure. FRODE It's lovely in the spring. \nBLOMKVIST You said it was lovely in winter. \nFRODE This is unseasonable. \nBLOMKVIST I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm. \nFRODE Unless we get snowed in ... I'm joking. You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish. \n27    INT/EXT. MERCEDES - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                   27 The car comes up a long, bare-tree-lined drive, leading to a stately manor. As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any attention; just someone hunting. \nVANGER Welcome.   Come inside.    It's warm. \n28   INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY                                     28 \nIt is warm inside. There are fires in the fireplaces. And Vanger himself is warm in nature, yet speaks quickly as they come through the house - VANGER Thank you for coming way out here. Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's insufficient coat. Would you like to freshen up? We'll be having dinner later. For now, hot tea is waiting. Unless you'd like a drink instead. What would you like? \nFRODE Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm. \nVANGER What? \nBLOMKVIST I can't stay for dinner. \nVanger looks thoroughly disappointed.      Or hurt. \nVANGER Oh. I guess I'd better be quick then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael, this way. 29   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                   29 \nTea service and pastries on a coffee table separate Blomkvist from Vanger, whose elderly frame is in danger of being swallowed up by a wing-back chair. \nThere are only a couple of results that include both terms. She goes to one of them, a body of text of some old page with the cached terms highlighted in yellow and blue, and reads - \n... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, CPA, Vanger Industries Accounting Dept., 1971-1972 ... Hmmm. \n31   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1960                           31 The children of the \"thieves, misers, bullies and incompetents\" play on a beach. A shutter blinks freezing a 12-year-old girl in foreground in black and white - \nVANGER V/O This is Harriet. The granddaughter of my brother Richard. \n32   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                 32 The same photograph of Harriet in a photo album Vanger shows Blomkvist. VANGER Richard, who I may as well start with to get it out of the way, was a Nazi of the first order - joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17. \nA page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young man in a uniform with a Nazi pin. \nVANGER Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom. (Blomkvist checks his watch) The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried. \nWe see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man. \nVANGER Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie. \nBLOMKVIST They're still called that. VANGER Are they?   Okay. INSERT:   Close on a photo of Gottfried. \nVANGER He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on. \nBLOMKVIST Someone has to do it. VANGER That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the island. A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children. \nVANGER His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet. \nA photo of a much younger Vanger and 15-year-old Harriet. \nVANGER She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person. BLOMKVIST And beautiful. Vanger nods as he regards the photo ... \nOpulent foyer. Security camera. Antique elevator cage whose cables pull the woman upstairs. Salander comes to an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement machine room. Examines tangles of phone lines, meters, Wi-Fi routers. Photographs them with a digital camera. She climbs the stairs back up to the foyer. The front door buzzes, and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes it open, sees her, holds it wide enough for her to pass. \nThe man is a driver/bodyguard. He continues to hold the door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an idling car and crosses to it in the rain ... Wennerstrom. \n48   EXT. VANGER'S MANOR - NIGHT                               48 \nThe rain here is icier and more punishing. \nVANGER V/O When the police investigation petered out, I kept at it - \n49   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT                                49 \nThey're eating dinner now in the dining room. \nVANGER - studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot. I've spent half my life examining the events of a single day. And for all that, he's no closer to the truth. \nBLOMKVIST I understand your frustration. But what you're asking me to do is a waste of money. VANGER We haven't discussed your fee. BLOMKVIST We don't need to. I can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years. \nVANGER You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind. \nBlomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as Vanger refills his wine glass. VANGER Here's what I propose: You come stay on the island. I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material I give you. You find something I've missed - or you don't. \nBLOMKVIST You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time. \nVANGER Think of it as a well deserved vacation. A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now. (nothing from Blomkvist) As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery. \nBLOMKVIST Mr. (Vanger) - \nVANGER I'm not done. I'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. I'll give it to you ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. \nBLOMKVIST Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one. And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him. \nERIKA There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone. \nHe kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a statue - and steps outside. BLOMKVIST It's four hours by train.   It's not the North Pole. 52   EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY                      52 The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with two suitcases. This time, Frode isn't there to meet him. He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi stand. 53   INT. TAXI - MOVING - DAY                                 53 \nAs a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him in the rear view mirror. BLOMKVIST Think this snow's going to let up anytime soon? \nHUSSEIN This is the North Pole. \n54   EXT. COTTAGE - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                       54 \nThe taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The taxi drives off and disappears into the snow. 55   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                       55 Two rooms. Fireplace. Pile of wood. A realtor would call it cozy. In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold. \nBlomkvist unpacks. Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and a small printer. \nHe flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him. BLOMKVIST What.   Milk? \nHe opens the old fridge.    No milk.    Nothing. 56   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                          56 \nHe comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water. Moves around trying to get a signal. Can't. 57   INT. MARKET - HEDESTAD - DUSK                               57 \nHe purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food. 58   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        58 \nHe walks along the street through wind-whipping snow, cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again. Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever - there are no cell towers anywhere around here. \n59   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        59 \nGrocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail. \nBlomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat. Nilsson dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made. \nNILSSON There. 66   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY                                  66 \nVanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old man, is inadequately dressed. \nVANGER The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse. \nBLOMKVIST He was there that day? \nVANGER Indeed he was. \nVanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds - VANGER That's his daughter Cecilia's house. They don't speak. \nBLOMKVIST Does anyone speak to anyone on this island? \nVANGER Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there - (points) - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I don't speak to her. (points) Cecilia's brother Birger lives there. BLOMKVIST Who doesn't he speak to? VANGER You, probably. Not that you'd want him to. He can be as unpleasant as Harald. \nBLOMKVIST I'm quickly losing track who's who. \nVANGER Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies. (points) Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother. \nIt's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point. \nBLOMKVIST Who speaks to him? VANGER I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you. \nThey hear a distant rifle crack and echo.     It startles Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger. \nVANGER Someone shooting their dinner. Gunner probably. The caretaker. BLOMKVIST I just met him. VANGER He was 19 when Harriet disappeared. \nMORELL I thought this was your house. \nVANGER It is.    She lives with me. MORELL Are her parents alive? VANGER Her mother is. \nVanger points Isabella out. Slender, overdressed and smoking a Sobranie, she immediately strikes Morell as a woman as venomous as she is beautiful. VANGER This way. Morell follows Vanger down a hall - \nINTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, \"Approx. 12:05, inspected missing girl's bedroom. Found - \" 71   INT. HARRIET'S ROOM - VANGER MANOR - DAWN - 1966           71 \nA purse on the desk in Harriet's room. Morell carefully removes the contents: Comb, pocket mirror, handkerchief, wallet containing a few kronor, her ID, and her address book. He leafs through this. DET. MORELL I want to speak to everyone here. That'll take all night so you might want someone to put some coffee on. \nYOUNGER VANGER What about the search? \nMORELL First thing in the morning. YOUNGER VANGER No. We should do it now. She could be hurt out there. \nVanger is either a good actor or has nothing to hide. VANGER Please.   I beg you. INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, \"authorized our patrol boat and two volunteer craft to begin 12:20 a.m. - G. Morell.\" \n71A   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT - 1966                        71A \nThe police patrol boat and two Peterssons motor around the island, spotlighting the shore and rocky cliffs. 71B   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                         71B \nThe weird tableaux of characters, awaiting their interviews with Morell. At the moment, he's across the room with Harald Vanger, taking notes, drinking coffee. \nINTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, \"Patrol 014 and Orienteering Club volunteers assembled, 6:40 a.m.\" \n72    OMIT:   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                  72 \n73    OMIT:   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT - 1966                 73 74    EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAWN - 1966                          74 \nSearch parties crisscross the island, wade through ditches, check old barns, shine flashlights up chimneys. Woodsmen with blood hounds comb through woods. \nMORELL She received this from Henrik the Christmas before. I studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it. BLOMKVIST It's the last page I'm curious about. MORELL As was I. \nBLOMKVIST The only names not alphabetized. Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting: Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018 \nMORELL They're local Hedestad phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find. He hands the address book back. It, and everything else about the case, clearly trouble him still. \nBLOMKVIST I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. I'm sorry. \nMORELL I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka Case. \nBlomkvist isn't sure what that means. \nMORELL Every policeman has at least one unsolved case. Back then it was old Torstensson. Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them. As young men, we had to laugh. BLOMKVIST Was this also a missing girl case? \nMORELL No, that's not why I mention it. The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go. And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case. 78   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY                                      78 \nAn unexciting social welfare building. \n79   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - DAY                               79 \nAs a man behind a desk reviews   a thick file, Salander reviews him: About 50; spends    money on suits, thinking that might disguise his public   servant status; no wedding ring; typical creep, as far as   she's concerned. \nBJURMAN How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was told he had a stroke of some kind. (nothing from Salander) Terrible. \nIt is, but she can tell he couldn't care less.     He leafs through her file - BJURMAN What exactly do you do at this security company? \nSALANDER Make coffee and sort mail. \nBJURMAN But not full-time. Not even part- time consistently. They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August? \nLIV I found him at death's door halfway up the hill. \nBLOMKVIST I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape. \nMARTIN No, it's a climb for anyone. I should've warned you. Come on in. \nBlomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand. 82   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                               82 \nThe place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern. Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere. LIV I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Goteborg. When it was sold, I went with it. MARTIN A dark day. \nLIV I live in Hong Kong now, but come back to Stockholm for family events, and when I do, I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin. MARTIN She comes for the moose steak. \nBLOMKVIST Is that what this is? \nThey all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange, wailing wind. Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine in Blomkvist's glass and gets up. MARTIN Something's open. You like this one, or would you like to try something else? \nBLOMKVIST That one's good. \nMartin heads off to the kitchen. Blomkvist and Liv, left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about. LIV I saw you on Sky News a while ago. \nBLOMKVIST That was a dark day. \nLIV Sorry to remind you of it. BLOMKVIST It's okay. There are worse things than libel - though I can't immediately think of one in my business. \nLIV You're writing a book now, Martin said. BLOMKVIST Henrik's biography. LIV I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin, too. Together they're the Old Sweden and the New. \nBLOMKVIST They are. LIV You know about Harriet, right? \nBlomkvist doesn't say.    The sound of the wind stops. LIV You don't? \n87   EXT. MACJESUS - DAY                                         87 \nSalander against the store window, cell phone to her ear. SECRETARY V/O I'm sorry, he's booked all day. \nSALANDER It'll take five minutes.      It's important. \nSECRETARY V/O Hold, please. Salander waits. Watches people stare at her like they always do. The secretary comes back on. \nSECRETARY V/O Seven o'clock. \n88   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT                    88 \nSalander comes past a janitor waxing a long, otherwise empty corridor. At the far end, she opens her new guardian's office door. \n89   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT                               89 As Bjurman reviews a McJesus invoice, Salander waits. The thick atmosphere reminds her of all the others she has sat in with school principals, shrinks and cops. \nBJURMAN Have you ever had an STD? (nothing from her) When's the last time you were tested for HIV? (MORE) Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ BJURMAN (CONT'D) (nothing) How many partners have you had in the last month? (nothing) How many were men? That last one seems to amuse him; none amuse her. BJURMAN I'm required to ask you these things. It's a matter of health. \nSALANDER Write down anything you want. Bjurman sighs. Sets the form aside and looks at the McJesus invoice again. BJURMAN Why do you need such an expensive computer? \nSALANDER For work. \nBJURMAN Making coffee and sorting mail. \nSALANDER I shouldn't even have to ask. I should have control of my money like before. \nBJURMAN And you will. Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people. Can you do that? (nothing from her) Shall we start with me? (pause) Shall we start now? \nAs he comes around the desk, she eyes a sharp letter opener sticking out above some pens in a coffee mug a child has painted with the word, `daddy.' BJURMAN If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. That's how normal people are. \nANITA You're looking for investment counseling, Mikael? BLOMKVIST I would if had any money to invest. \nANITA Excuse me? \nBLOMKVIST I'm writing a biography of your uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here. She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia predicted, but it doesn't come. 95   EXT. CAFE - LONDON - DAY                                    95 \nThey sit together at a little table on the sidewalk. ANITA How is Henrik? BLOMKVIST Good.   Engaging. I like him. \nShe does, too. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ \nANITA I haven't seen him in over 30 years. Or my sister. Or anyone else in my family. BLOMKVIST Most of what I'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid. \nANITA I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question. \nBLOMKVIST I can narrow it. I've gotten up to the 1960s. To the event that altered everything in Henrik's life. ANITA Harriet. (he nods) Everything I knew about that I told to - whatever his name was - that policeman - when it happened. BLOMKVIST Morell. \nANITA My recollections then were a lot better than they are now. \nBLOMKVIST I'm not speaking of the crime itself. I'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. Particularly, toward the end. \nANITA She was messed up. Like all us Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi like mine. \nBLOMKVIST Was he abusive? \nANITA Mine? BLOMKVIST Hers. \nANITA I never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on. One day she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school. The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine? Obviously, she was very unhappy. \nBLOMKVIST She never confided in you what about, specifically? ANITA There was no specifically. It was everything. It was being part of that family. Henrik's the only decent person in it. \nAs he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going, using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps herself in a blanket. The cat, who has no trouble with the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk. BLOMKVIST What have I missed besides you? ERIKA The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers. \nBLOMKVIST Seriously? \nERIKA Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat? \nBLOMKVIST I'm not.   I'm working. \nERIKA I can see. What she can see is the Vanger research covering the walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top. \nBLOMKVIST Would you like to meet him? \nERIKA Maybe in about an hour.      If you're interested. \nHe is. 108   INT. VANGER MANOR - EVENING                                108 \nVanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her. \nVANGER I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence. ERIKA We'll work through them. VANGER Are you sure? \nErika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them about this. \nMARTIN How long do you think you can hang on? Six months or so? ERIKA That sounds about right. \nVANGER (cheerfully) You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's. MARTIN We still own one. The Courier, here in town. \nVANGER I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else. \nErika nods politely. MARTIN So what do you say to taking on a partner? \nBLOMKVIST Why didn't you tell me? ERIKA Why would I.   You live in the woods. BLOMKVIST So I deserve to be treated like an idiot? \nERIKA I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could. BLOMKVIST I'm saying it now. It's not a good idea. \nERIKA You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months. I was lying. Without their money we'll be out of business in three. BLOMKVIST You don't know this family.   They're crazy. \nERIKA We're not marrying into it. \nBLOMKVIST We are if we do this. It's exactly what we're doing. \nERIKA You want to say no? Let's say no. Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing. \nThe logs crackle as flames climb them. She gets up, comes past him, unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears into the bedroom. He stares at the fire. ERIKA O/S Mikael? \nBLOMKVIST What. \nERIKA O/S I'm leaving this God-forsaken island in the morning. BLOMKVIST So? \nERIKA So are you coming to bed or not. \n110   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY                                110 \nSalander regards a selection of forearm tattoos: barbed wire, Celtic bands, strings of leaves and flowers. TATTOO ARTIST You thinking one arm or both? SALANDER Wrists and ankles. But none of these. Just a plain band, like handcuffs. \nTATTOO ARTIST It's sensitive there. Particularly the ankles. It's gonna hurt. \nThat doesn't bother her in the least. She rolls up her sleeves and watches him ready the tattoo gun. \nSALANDER How much do one of those cost? \n", "test1_input": "VANGER V/O It was chaos as everyone dropped what they were doing. \n41   EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY - 1966                              41 People and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge. \nVANGER V/O Police, an ambulance, fire brigade, reporter, photographer and onlookers quickly arrived from town, as those of us on the island - the family - hurried to the bridge from our side. \nThe truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab, but the other motorist is trapped. \nVANGER V/O The driver of the car - a Mr. Aronsson - was pinned and severely injured. All we could do was try to pry him out with our hands - since metal tools could spark. \nA local newspaper photographer and another man, snap pictures as Vanger and others try without success to pry the injured driver from his car. As the chaos ensues - \nVANGER V/O About twenty minutes after the crash, Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. 42    INT. KITCHEN - VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966                  42 \nAnna glances to Harriet as she comes in, then back out the window to the bridge. Harriet passes a clock that reads 2:35, steps outside, walks toward the woods ... \n43    EXT. THE BRIDGE - DUSK - 1966                             43 As the sun sets, Vanger and the others on the bridge make progress extracting the driver from the car. A young man coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help. VANGER V/O We finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital, and those of us on our side drifted back to the house. \n44    INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                          44 \nThe family has assembled at a long dining table. \nVANGER V/O The sun was down, the excitement over, we sat down to dinner. That's when I noticed Harriet wasn't there. \nVanger considers an empty chair as everyone else, including the young man from the bridge, his jacket draped on his chair, passes platters of food around. \nVANGER V/O And she wasn't there the next morning. Or the next. Or the next forty years. \n44A   OMIT:   INT.

Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen? \nBLOMKVIST She couldn't have run away? \nVANGER Not without being seen. \n45A   EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT - 1966                           45A The crews continue their work under lights. \nVANGER Firemen stayed on the bridge all night pumping out the gasoline. And no one swam across, or took a row boat. All of them were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, we checked. 45B   INT. VANGER MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY                   45B \nBLOMKVIST She couldn't have fallen and drowned? \nVANGER The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls into the water turns up nearby. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before. Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his labored breathing. \nVANGER No. Someone killed her, Mr. Blomkvist. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a wall. \nVANGER These were from her. \nAnd, on another wall, forty similarly-framed flowers - VANGER These, from her killer. Blomkvist regards the forty ... \nBLOMKVIST Who knows about these? \nVANGER Me, the police, the murderer ... and now you. \n46   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DUSK                                     46 It's raining as an elegantly-dressed woman slows before a luxurious apartment building. Salander approaches from the other direction. Passing, she notes the four number tones the woman keys in the code lock. \nThe door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside.

He slugs her. She goes down, but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now. \nShe doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator and disappears into the underground station. 84   INT/EXT.

He puts the box in a closet on top of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch. CECILIA Hi. I thought I'd come over and say hello. I'm Cecilia. \n85   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                         85 Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the wall. Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post- It next to it that reads: Recent Photo? INSERT of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager, and a Post-It with her name on it. \nCECILIA We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family. \nBLOMKVIST It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company. \nCECILIA Like I said. \nBLOMKVIST It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone. \nCECILIA Unlike the one that landed you in court. BLOMKVIST Unlike that one. Correct. CECILIA So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet. \nSilence.   Then - \nBLOMKVIST I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus. CECILIA So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where? - in the closet now? - weren't Henrik's private investigation. (Blomkvist can't think fast enough to respond) I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.

You should talk to her. \nBLOMKVIST I'd love to, where is she. CECILIA If I had to guess - London. BLOMKVIST You don't know where your own sister lives? \nCECILIA I haven't seen her in years.       We never really got along. BLOMKVIST I'm getting used to that comment. \nCECILIA That's the way it is when you're always after the same boys. \nBLOMKVIST People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point. \nCECILIA Oh, I'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again. She hates this place even more than I do. She left, moved to London and that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit. BLOMKVIST I'll try to track her down for you. \nCECILIA Don't bother. BLOMKVIST For myself then. \nHe smiles.    She studies him.      Maybe he's not so bad. \nCECILIA If you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off. 86   INT.

She knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to. BJURMAN Is there a problem? \nSALANDER I just want to know, am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat? BJURMAN It's so cute when you do that surly thing. Take my hand She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other to his own wrist. This is bad. She tries to get out. He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into unconsciousness. 100A   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT                 100A \nShe comes to, on her stomach, sees her wrists cuffed to the headboard posts, her ankles secured to the foot posts with silk ties, and scissors slicing her jeans off. She starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her underwear. BJURMAN Please.   I have neighbors. \nHe lights a couple candles.   Switches on some New Age music. \nBJURMAN What we're going to do now is teach you the value of money. \nHe watches her struggle. But she's not going anywhere. He tears open a condom package with his teeth. \nBJURMAN I forget - did I ask you before if you liked anal sex? \nHe crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top of her. She keeps fighting but there's not much she can do handcuffed. Eventually, she retreats to another place inside herself. She's had to go here before in her life; it's the only place to go in such situations. \n101    INT.

He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at photos of her school friends in her wallet. Then picks up the Bible. Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet Vanger. He opens it at random. Hebrews: \nHARRIET V/O Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Through faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God - and that what is seen was not made of things that are visible ... \nHe sets it down. Rubs his eyes. Everything - his daughter, his life, this cabin, the word of God - is depressing. 101A   INT.

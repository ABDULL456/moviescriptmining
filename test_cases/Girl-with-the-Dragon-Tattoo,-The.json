BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        15 Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika - in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather jacket. \nShe wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half- eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it. \nERIKA Usually when I wake up in a cold bed, it's at home. \nBLOMKVIST Sorry. \nERIKA What are you doing? \nBLOMKVIST Writing the press release. \nERIKA Saying - BLOMKVIST You're taking over as publisher. You're sorry for any nuisance Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be reached for comment. \nERIKA You're giving up. BLOMKVIST Just taking a few steps aside. For you.

GREGER You needed a better attorney.       You needed your sister. BLOMKVIST She offered. \nANNIKA He declined. BLOMKVIST As she hoped. ANNIKA Never a good idea mixing family and business. \nBLOMKVIST And I still would have lost. \nGREGOR Did you have ... anything on him. \nBLOMKVIST I had a lot.    It just wasn't any good. \nERIKA It wasn't even about Mikael. It was Wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole - and the FSA: Don't ask questions. \nBlomkvist's daughter seems concerned for him. BLOMKVIST I'm fine, Nilla.

For the first time since we've met her, she looks vulnerable. The doors swing open. A doctor steps out. Salander gets up to hear his report - \nDOCTOR You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?

VANGER Richard, who I may as well start with to get it out of the way, was a Nazi of the first order - joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17. \nA page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young man in a uniform with a Nazi pin. \nVANGER Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom. (Blomkvist checks his watch) The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried. \nWe see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man. \nVANGER Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie. \nBLOMKVIST They're still called that. VANGER Are they?   Okay. INSERT:   Close on a photo of Gottfried. \nVANGER He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on. \nBLOMKVIST Someone has to do it. VANGER That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the island. A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children. \nVANGER His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet. \nA photo of a much younger Vanger and 15-year-old Harriet. \nVANGER She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person.

Vanger and a few family members sip afternoon cocktails.    Harriet appears. \nVANGER V/O She came to the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important, but I told her to give me a few minutes. She leaves.   He returns to the others in the room. \nVANGER V/O But in a few minutes, before I could go upstairs to talk to her, something else occurred. \n39   EXT.

Switches on some New Age music. \nBJURMAN What we're going to do now is teach you the value of money. \nHe watches her struggle. But she's not going anywhere. He tears open a condom package with his teeth. \nBJURMAN I forget - did I ask you before if you liked anal sex? \nHe crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top of her.

He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at photos of her school friends in her wallet. Then picks up the Bible. Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet Vanger. He opens it at random. Hebrews: \nHARRIET V/O Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Through faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God - and that what is seen was not made of things that are visible ... \nHe sets it down. Rubs his eyes.

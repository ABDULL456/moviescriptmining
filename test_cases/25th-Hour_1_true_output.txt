MR. BROGAN 
I'm saying if you want. If that's what you want, I'll do it. Monty closes his eyes. We hear the tire chains rattling on the snow. We hear the old engine wheezing. CLOSE on Monty's ravaged face, on his eyelids. Mr. Brogan keeps talking and New York City melts away. 
MR. BROGAN (COM" D) 
We'll drive and keep driving. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY -- DAY 
As Mr. Brogan speaks, we watch the car driving west. The voice-over tracks with the images on the screen. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) 
Head out to the middle of nowhere. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY 
The car speeds along a desert highway now, past the pitchfork cacti and towering mesas. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET -- DAY 
The car drives slowly down the main street of a one stoplight town. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) 
Find a nice little town. 
CUT TO: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Mr. Brogan parks in front of a small bar with an old- fashioned BAR sign in front. Mr. Brogan and Monty (his face unmarred) step out of the car. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TOWN BAR -- DAY 
Mr. Brogan and Monty are sitting at a corner table. Mr . Brogan raises his glass of whiskey to Monty and both men drink. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) 
Find a bar, and I'll buy us drinks. I haven't had a drink in nineteen years, but I'll have one with you. And then I'll leave. 
CUT TO: 
Monty stands at the window of the bar, watching Mr. Brogan drive away. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
I'll tell you don't ever write me, don't ever come visit. I'll tell you I believe in God's Kingdom and I believe I'll be with you again, and your mother. But not in this lifetime. Monty approaches the BARTENDER, a powerfully-built older man (60). Monty speaks and the bartender listens carefully, but we don't hear the dialogue. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
You get a job somewhere, a job that pays cash, a boss who doesn't ask questions, and you make a new life, and you never come back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TOWN BAR -- NIGHT 
Monty works behind the bar on a crowded night. The bar PATRONS, a blue-collar rural crowd, are rowdy drinkers, but Monty works efficiently, quickly filling their orders. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HEAD SHOP -- NIGHT 
Monty, in the backroom of a seedy head shop, sits for a photograph in front of a black drop. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) 
You find the right people and you get yourself papers, a driver's license. 
EXT. TOWN BAR -- DAY 
Monty sits on the steps in back of the bar, looking out past the gravel lot toward the distant mountains. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) 
And then you wait. People get caught when they come home. But you're never coming home. 
EXT. BUS STATION -- DAY 
Monty, a few years older, waits as a Greyhound bus pulls into the station. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) 
And maybe -- and this is dangerous-- but maybe after a couple years you send word to Naturelle. Naturelle steps off the Greyhound bus. She sees Monty. They stare at each other, twenty feet apart. Finally he goes to her, threading through the other travellers, the other waiting families. He takes her in his arms. 
INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
In the cramped apartment above the bar where Monty works, Monty and Naturelle sit together, on a sofa, watching a small television. Naturelle is pregnant. The ball is about to drop in Times Square. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) 
You forget about New York. You can't come back. You can't call, you can't write. 
INT. SMALL HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Monty, much older now, stands in front of his family, his grown CHILDREN and the little GRANDCHILDREN. Naturelle, equally aged, sits with one of the little girls on her lap. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) 
And maybe one day, years from now, long after I'm dead and gone, you gather your whole family together and you tell them the truth. Who you are and where you came from. As Monty speaks his children exchange glances. They can't really believe what they're hearing, but they know their father is telling the truth. 
MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
You tell them the whole thing. And then you ask them if they know how lucky they are to be there. Monty looks at his family. He is awed by their existence, by the life he has created. He looks at Naturelle, still beautiful in old age, and she smiles back at him. 
OLD MONTY 
It all came so close to never happening. 
INT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA -- MORNING

Mike and Scarlet hide behind the pool house, peek around the corner, spy on Alex and Nicole by the fire pit. Alex is animated, confident... 
SCARLET He's like a totally different person. 
Scarlet and Mike step back by the pool, sit on a lounge. 
SCARLET (CONT'D) It's been so good for him to have you around. You have no idea. 
MIKE Believe me, I do. He's a great kid. And you're an amazing mother. 
SCARLET I'm not so sure. I mean look at me. I showed up at a party to drag my son home. Could I be any more embarrassing? And how many amazing mothers run their kids' father off? 
MIKE Hey, you didn't run him off. Don't blame yourself for his stupidity. 
SCARLET I knew he was unhappy. I knew he hated his job. I should've been more supportive, more sympathetic to what he was going through. He gave up a lot for me. 
MIKE That's bull shit! You, Maggie and Alex are the best thing that ever happened to me...him. He was just too selfish to recognize it. At least, that's how I see it. 
Scarlet smiles thankfully at Mike. 
ANGLE...Maggie and the Bras roam the backyard searching for Mike. 
JAMIE He's over there.    By the pool. 
SAMANTHA Who's the ho? 
MAGGIE Mom? 
ANGLE...Alex and Nicole, hand in hand, stroll back towards the house when Alex freezes- 
ALEX Whoa.   What's my mom doing here? 
ANGLE...Scarlet places a hand over Mike's. 
SCARLET You're sweet. I have no idea why I'm telling you all this. There's just something so familiar... 
Scarlet looks into Mike's eyes. Mike stares back. She's vulnerable. He loves her. It's perfect. Mike leans in and KISSES HER...PASSIONATELY. 
SSSSSLAP.   Mike falls off the chair.   Scarlet leaps up. 
SCARLET (CONT'D) What do you think you're doing!? 
Mike scrambles to his feet. 
MIKE Scar, just calm down. I have something to tell you but I need you to keep an open mind. Can you do that for me? 
SCARLET This conversation is over, Mark. 
MIKE I'm not Mark. 
SCARLET I'm not in the mood for games. 
MIKE It's no game. I'm me...him...Mike. It's me...your husband. 
Scarlet winces as if dealt a blow- 
SCARLET What?   Why would you say that? 
MIKE It's the truth. I'm the father of your children. You have to believe me. 
SCARLET Don't ever come near me or my family again. If you do, I'll have you arrested or better yet, institutionalized. 
Scarlet marches towards the house.    Mike on her heels pleading. 
MIKE Let me explain, Scar. 
As she passes Ed and Julie. 
SCARLET Your son needs a shrink! 
Scarlet storms off.   Before Mike can protest- 
MAGGIE Pervert! 
Mike turns. SLAP. Maggie lights him up, runs for the house. SLAP, SLAP, SLAP. The Bras add theirs on the way out.

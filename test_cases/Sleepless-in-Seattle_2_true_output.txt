SAM 
Thank God.  Something you don't 
know.  It's a single white 
female. 
JONAH 
This is no good.  She's looking 
for someone French.  Or Greek. 
(puzzled, he throws the 
letter into the reject 
pile, opens another) 
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 
live in Tulsa." Where is that? 
SAM 
Oklahoma.  Do you know where 
that is? 
JONAH 
Somewhere in the middle. 
SAM 
I'm not going to think about 
what they're not teaching you 
in school.  I am not going to 
think about it. 
(beat) 
Generally speaking I think we 
should rule out people who 
don't live somewhere near here 
JONAH 
She's willing to fly anywhere. 
As Jonah hands Sam the picture. 
SAM 
She looks like my third grade 
teacher.  I hated my third 
grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait 
a minute! She is my third 
grade teacher! 
JONAH 
Dad, you're not taking this 
seriously. 
SAM 
This is not how you do it. 
(referring to the 
hamburger) 
You want this on an English 
muffin or a bun? 
JONAH 
English muffin.  How do you do 
it? 
SAM 
You see someone you like, you 
get a feeling about them, you 
ask them if they want to have a 
drink or -- 
JONAH 
-- a slice of pizza -- 
SAM 
But not dinner necessarily on 
the first date because by the 
time you're halfway through 
dinner you might be sorry you 
asked them to dinner whereas if 
it's just a drink, if you like 
them you can always ask them 
for dinner but if you don't you 
can go home if you see what I 
mean. 
(beat) 
I wonder if it still works this 
way. 
JONAH 
It doesn't.  They ask you. 
SAM 
I'm starting to notice that. 
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Annie and Walter are making love. 
JONAH (V.O.) 
If you get a new wife, I guess 
you'll have sex with her, huh? 
SAM (V.O.) 
What do you think? 
JONAH (V.O.) 
Will she scratch up your back? 
SAM (V.O.) 
What? 
JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
As Sam puts Jonah to sleep.  Jonah is holding his teddy 
bear while this conversation concludes. 
JONAH 
In the movies women are always 
scratching up guy's back and 
screaming and stuff.  When 
they're having sex. 
SAM 
Whose show was this on? 
JONAH 
Jed's got cables. 
SAM 
Go to sleep. 
He kisses him good-night. 
JONAH 
Kiss Howard. 
(he holds out the 
teddy bear) 
G'night, Howard. 
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Annie and Walter have just finished making love. 
Walter falling asleep. 
Annie lying in bed, with her eyes open. 
She starts to get out of bed.  Puts on a robe. 
INT. STAIRWAY - HOUSE 
As Annie comes downstairs in a bathrobe. 
She opens the door to the street. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
As Annie starts to run down the street. 
CLOSEUP OF: ANNIE, RUNNING 
And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running

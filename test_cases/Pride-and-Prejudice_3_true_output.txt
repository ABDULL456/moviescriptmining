ROOM: 
123 INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. 123 
Jane and Elizabeth lie in bed. 
JANE He has made me so happy. You know, he. was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! 
ELIZABETH How did he account for it? 
JANE He thought me indifferent! 
ELIZABETH Unfathomable. 
JANE No doubt poisoned by his pernicious sister. 
ELIZABETH Bravo! That is the most unforgiving speech you've ever made. 
JANE Oh Lizzie, if I could but see you so happy. If there were such another man for you! There is a noise outside. 
ELIZABETH Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr Collins in time. What is that? More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each other. 
124 INT. DOWNSTAIRS -- LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 12.4- 
Mr Bennet, Mrs Bennet and the girls lit by only candles have gathered. The door bangs again. 
MARY Maybe he's changed his mind. Timidly, Mr Bennet opens the door revealing a wide-eyed Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Everyone gasps. 
ELIZABETH Lady Catherine! Lady Catherine does not acknowledge her, but comes in uninvited, inspecting the assembled company of aghast Bennets. 
LADY CATHERINE (to Mrs Bennet) And these are your daughters, I suppose. 
MRS BENNET All but one, the youngest has been lately married your ladyship. And my eldest was only proposed to yesterday afternoon. 
LADY CATHERINE You have a very small garden, madam. 
MRS BENNET â¢ I am sure it is nothing compared to Rosings, but it is larger than Sir William Lucas's, I can assure you. 
MR BENNET 
(TENTATIVELY) Could I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps? 
LADY CATHERINE Absolutely not! I must speak to Miss Elizabeth alone, as a matter of complete urgency. The Bennets all look at each other", bewildered by this strange turn of events. 
125 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 125 
Elizabeth leads the way into the drawing room - lights an oil lamp. Lady Catherine walks in. The door closes behind them. 
LADY CATHERINE You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand why I am`here. â¢ Lit only by the oil lamp Lady Catherine resembles a flickering ghoul. 
ELIZABETH Indeed you are mistaken. I can not account for this honour at all. 
LADY CATHERINE Miss Bennet, I warn you, I am not to be trifled with. A report of a most alarming nature has reached me that you intend to be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy. Elizabeth stares at her, amazed. 
LADY CATHERINE (CONT'D) I know this to be a scandalous falsehood, though not wishing to injure him by supposing it possible, I instantly set off to make my sentiments known. 
ELIZABETH If you believed it impossible, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. 
LADY CATHERINE To hear it contradicted, Miss Bennet. 
ELIZABETH 
(COOLLY) Your coming here will be rather a confirmation, surely, if indeed such a report exists. 
LADY CATHERINE If? Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourself? 
ELIZABETH I have never heard of it. 
LADY CATHERINE And can you declare there is no foundation for it? 
ELIZABETH I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask the questions, which I may not choose to answer. 
LADY CATHERINE This is not to be borne. Has my nephew made you an offer of marriage? 
IS

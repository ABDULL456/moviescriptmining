INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY 
It's three years later and MARK is sitting with his LAWYERS at a large conference table. 
MARK is wearing a hoodie, sweatpants and Adidas flip-flops--a personal uniform that we'll come to understand. And while it may take us a while to notice it, MARK's a different person in these flash-forward scenes. Still tortured and complicated, but comfortable now with his own power. His lawyer is SY, who's accompanied by some junior associates, one of whom--a pleasant, pretty and professional young contemporary of Mark's named MARYLIN, we'll get to know. On the other side are EDUARDO and his lawyer, GRETCHEN, also a. â¢ mpanied by some associates. A STENOGRAPHER is typing the recor.. The room is glass on two sides and through the windows we can see the behemoths of Silicon valley--Oracle, SunMicrosystems, Google, etc. GRETCHEN is taking MARK's deposition. 
GRETCHEN So you were called in front of the Ad Board. 
MARK That's not what happened. 
GRETCHEN You weren't called in front of the Administrative Board? 
MARK No, back, I mean--That's--back at the bar with Erica Albright. She said all that? That I said that stuff to her? 
GRETCHEN i was reading from the transcript of her 
DEPOSITION SO-- 
MARK why would you even need to depose her? 
GRETCHEN That's really for us to-- 
MARK You think if I know she can make me look like a. jerk I'll be more likely-- 
SY 
MARKÂ 
MARK --to settle, right? 
SY Why don't we stretch our legs a minute, can we do that? It's been almost three hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with the girl's testimony in the bar. 
MART I'm not embarrassed, it's just that she made a lot of that up. 
GRETCHEN She was under oath. 
MARK Then I guess that would be the first time somebody's lied under oath. People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly. MARK stays in his seat. MARYLIN, the attractive second year associate who's on Mark's legal team is still sitting too... about four seats down from Mark. 
MARYLIN Eight percent of the male population of Harvard had been on it within two hours? 
MARK 
(BEAT) Eighty. 
MARYLIN What? 
MARK ' ' Eighty percent of the male population. 
MARYLIN 
(PAUSE--EVEN) Wow.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - DAWN 
The Harvard Crew is practicing on two-man sculls. There are three boats that are running roughly even with each other and the two-man crews are rowing with all they've got. We're gliding along with them in the water-- 
CREW MEMBER 
(SHOUTING) Bring up the rate! 2 in 2! One..two-- 
ANOTHER CREW MEMBER (DIFFERENT 
BOAT) Power 10 in 2! In 2! 
A THIRD CREW MEMBER (DIFFERENT 
BOAT) They had open water after a hundred meters. I don't think we're gonna catch 'em today. And we PULL BACK TO REVEAL that there's a fourth boat which is already five boat, ngths ahead of the other three. 
The fourth boat is being crewed by CAMERON and TYLER WINKLEVOSS----identical twins who stepped out of an ad for Abercrombie and Fitch. They know that the others aren't in their class and even though they're highly competitive athletes, they don't like showing anyone up, least of all their teammates. 
CAMERON Is there anyway to make this a fair fight? 
TYLER We could jump out and swim. 
CAMERON I think we'd have to jump out and drown. 
TYLER I'm not willing to do that. 
CAMERON What are we at three-quarter power? Let's drop down to a half. 
TYLER Or you could row forward and I could row backward. 
CAMERON I'd kick your ass. 
TYLER We're genetically identical, so biology and mathematics says we'd stay in one place not allowing for the current or the wind. 
CAMERON Just row the boat. 
And the WINI{LEVOSS twins kick into full gear and open up an even wider lead as we.

INT. DINING HALL - MORNING 
Two stacks of The Crimson, Harvard's student newspaper, get dropped on the floor as TYLER and CAMERON walk by--their trays loaded with mountains of eggs and pancakes and carbs. Everyone knows and loves them in this 200 year old dining hall and they wave and shout to a few people and whisper to a couple of very pretty girls before taking a seat next to DIVYA NARENDRA, a nice looking Indian student whose face is in a copy of the Crimson. 
CAMERON What's up? 
DIVYA You guys hear about this? 
CAMERON What? 
DIVYA Two nights ago a sophomore at Kirkland crashed the computers. 
CAMERON Which computers? 
DIVYA All of them. Be crashed the whole system. TYLER picks up a copy-of the Crimson and begins reading while his brother and DIVYA keep talking. 
CAMERON How? 
DIVYA He set up a website where you vote on the hotness of female Harvard undergrads. What were we doing that none of us heard about this? 
CAMERON I don't know. Rowing, going to class, studying? How much activity was there on this thing that he crashed the--

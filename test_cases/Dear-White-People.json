{"train": "DEAR WHITE PEOPLE \nWritten by \nJustin Simien \nREVISED: August 21st, 2013 \n1    NEWS BROADCAST - VARIOUS SCREENS, VARIOUS PLACES             1 \nANCHOR A \"race war\" has erupted at one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious institutions. \nGlued to this are our story's subjects, who we meet in... \n2    A SERIES OF SHOTS                                            2 \nTROY FAIRBANKS, 21, Black. He drags a brush through his finger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark of imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor. \nANCHOR (O.S.) Outrage over an \"African American Themed\" party organized by predominately white students of Manchester University has resulted in rioting and property damages. \n2A   KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue      2A eyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room. \nANCHOR (O.S.) (CONT'D) Guests were invited to \"liberate their inner Negro, fry up chicken, enjoy a sugar water concoction known as Purple drank and wear oversized Barack Obama T-shirts.\" \n2B   COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts    2B adjusts the straight bangs of her weave to better see the small TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips.            * \nANCHOR (CONT'D) Officials claim an investigation is underway to find those responsible for the event and subsequent riot. \n2C   SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an       2C edit bay. Despite her light skin, the Afro pick in her fro pompadour leaves little doubt she identifies as Black. \nANCHOR (CONT'D) In an effort to address diversity issues, the school appointed African American scholar Dr. Walter Fairbanks as Dean of Students. \n2D   LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed    2D glasses in a bustling indifferent Dining Hall. A guilt pains his otherwise boyish face. \nANCHOR (CONT'D) Last year the Dean's office celebrated slight gains in diverse applicants but with many now calling for Fairbanks' resignation, that may have been pre-mature. \n2E   DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his       2E 50's fights a panic as he watches in a stately office. \nANCHOR (CONT'D) Up next, a cat that loves to water ski? That and more after the break. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS How could this happen? \nTITLE CARD: FIVE WEEKS AGO \n3    EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY                                 3 \nThis sprawling impressive mix of Colonial, Gothic and Modern architecture is presented like a living brochure. \nSUPERIMPOSE: MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - \"NOSCE TE IPSUM\" \nAs we cut through the living brochure, we're presented with groups and programs. Their CRESTS and titles SUPERIMPOSED. \nSERIES OF SHOTS - TOP ACADEMIC PROGRAMS \n3A   White kids with \"Trump\" blazers and glares - DESMOND         3A SCHOOL OF BUSINESS. \n3B   Kids with dark eye circles and unkempt hair stand before     3B the BING SCHOOL OF HISTORY. \n3C   A cluster of skinny jeans and expressive hands before the 3C GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL. ONE BLACK KID stands in the back. \nSAM (V.O.) Dear White People. The minimum requirement of Black friends needed to not seem racist has just been raised to two. \n4    INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY                                          4 \nSamantha White (Sam) watches the campus through a one way window with the cool but knowing gaze of someone much older. She gets off on sensing and pushing buttons - with a subversive delivery style that boarders on deadpan. \nSUPERIMPOSE: SAMANTHA WHITE, SENIOR, VISUAL AND NEW MEDIA \nSAM (CONT'D) Sorry, but your weed man Tyrone does not count. \nShe fades in JAZZ on her control board and leans back to address a box of pamphlet sized books bearing the title \"EBONY AND IVY: A SURVIVAL GUIDE.\" One by one she scribbles her autograph on the books. \n5    EXT. ELLINGTON LIBRARY - DAY                                     5 \nSERIES OF SHOTS - NATIONALLY RENOWNED STUDENT GROUPS \nDisheveled caffeinated writers of the MANCHESTER BUGLE. \n5A   Casual Prepsters shoot us the finger - PASTICHE HUMOR INC. 5A \n5B   Hopping out of a taxi is Lionel Higgins. His sweet but       5B insecure nature as plain as the unkempt fro on his head. \nCOCO Excuse me? \nHELMUT What part of Chicago you from? \nCOCO Hyde Park. \nHELMUT What street? \nCOCO Seventy Eighth and -- \nHELMUT -- Seventy Eighth is Southside sweetheart. And you know what they say. You can take the girl out the hood but -- \nCOCO -- Ain't nothing hood about me. \nHELMUT Thanks so much for coming in. \nCoco gets up to leave. Tries to recover. \nCOCO So what's this show about anyway? \nHELMUT Here's the way reality works sweetheart, I'm the producer. I ask the questions. Be in touch. \nAnd with that Helmut hustles Coco out. He sits and ponders before unmuting his iPad. \nSAM (O.S.) Dear White People I am here to burst your post-racial little bubble. (MORE) \nSAM (O.S.) (CONT'D) Yes Oprah may have her own network, but Ann Coulter is still writing best sellers, Black kids are still getting shot for wearing hoodies, and even here the few vestiges of Black culture are under attack by conservative groups, trustees and yes our very own President Fletcher. \nHelmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin. \nHELMUT This is the school radio? \n13   INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY                         13 \nA pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the halls of Armstrong / Parker where Black students have lively debates, flirt and bump the student radio. \nSAM (O.S.) Dear White People, thanks to the new process of randomizing housing assignments for Sophomores, some of you may be jarred by an assignment to Armstrong/Parker house. \nThe owner of the Jordans is revealed as Troy Fairbanks. \nTROY Someone turn that trash off. \nSUPERIMPOSE: TROY FAIRBANKS, SENIOR, POLITICAL SCIENCE \nEven with his post workout sweat he looks like the cover of Jet. Troy exudes \"approachable homie\" as he spots a small group of WHITE SOPHOMORES who walk timidly down the hall. \nTROY (CONT'D) Newbies right? \nThe white sophomores nod their heads yes. \nTROY (CONT'D) Welcome to Armstrong / Parker, home of the dopest dining hall in all of Manchester. I'm Troy, Head of House. \nSOPHOMORE What's up my brother? \nSAM (O.S.) When encountering a Black person try and stay calm. Don't say things like \"what's up\" and \"my brotha\" That's not how you normally talk. \nTROY Ya'll take care. Nice Jordan's bro. \nCoco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette who exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls. \nSOFIA Your hair is so cute B. T. Dubs. \nCOCO You're so cute. \nSOFIA Is it weaved? \nCoco's face is a battle between fury and polite surprise. \nSOFIA (CONT'D) I saw \"Good Hair\" in Afro studies. \nCOCO (moving on) Hey what house did you get? \nSOFIA Huh? Oh Bechet bitch. \nCOCO Of course. The mere thought of a Fletcher anywhere else... \nSOFIA Easy, it was the luck of the draw. Daddy had nothing to do with it. \nCoco rolls her eyes behind a smile. \nSOFIA (CONT'D) And honestly, if I had to pick anywhere to be it'd be here. \n19   EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY                                        19 \nLionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out to.. \n...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he trades \"No Homo's\" with the others. \nLionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing. \nNot right either. Where does he fit? By surprise... \nGEORGE Lionel right? \nGEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) George. We had Civ last semester? How you doing? \nLIONEL Grood...Gate...I'm ah.. \nGEORGE Fan of your stuff. In the Observer? \nLIONEL No one reads the Observer. \nGEORGE You seen this? \nGeorge hands Lionel Sam's \"Missing Black Culture\" flyer. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) The residents of Armstrong / Parker just made her head of house. Am I crazy or is there a there there? \nLIONEL What made you come over here? \nGeorge holds up Sam's \"Ebony & Ivy.\" Lionel takes it. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) I mean I'm glad you came -- \nGEORGE -- My staff? God bless them. They're whiter than Michael Jackson's kids. We're fucked if anyone of them writes this story and I will not let the transfers at the Gazette do it first. \nLIONEL The oldest one has his face. \nGEORGE You're in the Black Student Union. You probably know Sam. \nLionel shakes his head \"yes\" and \"no\" at the same time. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) You come up with a good angle? I want it in the Bugle. \nLionel eyes the bold \"Bugle\" logo on George's shirt. \nLIONEL (aside) Trumpet... \nGEORGE Bugle. Focus. The only paper on campus with a national subscription base and an Advisor from the New York Times? Only so many ways a person can distinguish themselves at a place like this Lionel. You're good. You belong with us. \nThe way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we know he's never heard these words. Never belonged any place. Doesn't hurt there's a handsome boy smiling at him either. \n20   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY                     20 \nTroy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall between them. \nTROY Get it yet? \nSam shakes her head yes. \nTROY (CONT'D) Good. You've now got the shared calendar, contacts, and official email. \nTroy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack of papers. \nTROY (CONT'D) Oh and before I forget. \nSAM Event requests for the year? \nTROY Just this month. They need your approval. Also don't forget to pick your office hours. At least 20 per week. \nSAM That's absurd. \nTROY You're in charge of a hundred residents now. And they need time to complain to your face. About noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free options in the cafeteria. Etcetera. \nSAM Troy. I didn't think I was going to win. \nTROY And by the way petitioning the President on the Randomization of Housing Act isn't gonna do shit. None of the other houses are concerned. \nSAM Because they all have a legacy of rich and powerful allies on the board who will make sure that \"random\" works out to their advantage. \nTROY And you think a petition is going to change that? \nKURT The biggest athletes, movie stars, hell your president is Black. (MORE) \nKURT (CONT'D) Sometimes I think the hardest thing to be in the American work force right now is an educated white guy. \nSUNGMI You're not serious. \nKURT You guys still got affirmative action, you're set. \nREGGIE This shit. \nSAM What are you doing in here? \nKURT Obama. Leader of the free world got into Harvard on affirmative action. Know who's not president right now? The guy that didn't get in. \nSAM On behalf of the colored folks in the room, let me apologize for all the better qualified white students whose place we're taking up. \nKurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument. \nSAM (CONT'D) You get lost? Bechet is that way. \nKURT Yeah but what other dining hall gives you chicken and waffles? Dear White People right? Funny stuff. How haven't we staffed you yet? \nSAM On Pastiche? Your uninspired humor magazine? \nKURT We're a lot more than a magazine sweetie. SNL staff is basically half Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just like the network comedies. \nA flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco. \nSAM What gives you Clubhouse kids the right to come to our Dining Hall? \nKurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese. \nSAM (CONT'D) You don't live here. \nMARTIN Sam? What are you doing? \nSAM You can't eat here. \nKurt eyes this new adversary. Enjoys a good challenge. \nTROY Chill Sam damn. Let the man-- \nKURT & SAM -- I got this. \nKURT Who are you to put me out? \nSAM (realizing) I'm the Head of this house. And I'm doing things my way. \nSam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to which Sam slams his tray to the ground. \nLionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad. \nKURT You got any idea who you're -- \nSAM -- Yeah, I know who your daddy is. The same one who's been pushing to break up this House for a decade. What's wrong? Is he scared letting the Negroes gather in groups might start a rebellion on the plantation? You tell him from me...he should be. \nKurt looks into Sam's eyes and then his crew. They want out. \nKURT Bad move. \nKurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight snicker from Lionel which draws Sam's eyes right to him. \nSomething sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts to GEORGE: \"I've got the angle. I'm in.\" \nSAM You too. \nLIONEL Me? \nSAM Is this your house? \nLionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him. \nSam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady applause. Troy and his table look around baffled. \nBy the caution on Sam's face it seems the first time she's ever heard this sound directed at her. \nA slight envy boils in Coco. \nOne last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out. Locked out again. \n23   INT. COCO'S ROOM - DAY                                       23 \nGORDON \"The honeys?\" You're from Vermont. \nKURT Guys what's the Pastiche motto? \nGORDON \"Sharpen thy sword.\" \nMITCH Our motto is a euphemism for masturbation? \nGORDON It's a reminder that satire is the weapon of reason. So who on campus is being unreasonable? \nMITCH Sounds like a reminder of how gay you are. \nGORDON Was that even a reasonable attempt at a quip Mitch? \nMITCH Hey Gordon, say reasonable again. \nSAM (O.S.) Dear White People, knowing Lil' Wayne lyrics no longer earns you an Honorary Black Card. It just reminds me how often you say the word \"nigga\" when no one Black is around as is required in reciting said lyrics. \nKurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs headphones into his computer and looks down. \nKURT The hell does Sam think she is? \nMITCH Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a pissed off baby. \nKurt shares a glance with Mitch and Gordon - they're leaning towards the same idea. \nKURT Could we? \nGORDON How? \nKurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick. \nKURT Hey Lionel. Talked to the Dean today. (MORE) \nKURT (CONT'D) We had a very enlightening conversation. I just want to say... I'm sorry about the voice message. \n29B   DINING ROOM                                              29B \nKurt and his crew cross over to Lionel's table. Kurt unzips his pants silently. \nKURT (CONT'D) Do you accept? \nLionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he starts flopping his dick around off screen. Lionel quickly looks in the other direction. Kurt's friends crack up. \nGORDON Please put that away. \nKURT You got to talk to these people in a language they'll understand. \nLionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro. \nLIONEL Pathetic. \nKURT (yelling) Wherever he ships you off to, be sure to pack a sense of humor with you, kay bro? \nLionel drowns them out. He flips through Sam's \"Ebony & Ivy\" book to a section called... \nSAM (V.O.) The Paper Bag Tests. \nAs Lionel reads we swish pan to... \n30    DREAM DINER                                                  30 \n...an abstract Diner set. Sam at the counter addresses us. \nSUPERIMPOSE: THE TIP TEST \nSAM The Tip Test. You hit up Jelly's for a snack. Your waitress mistakes you for someone who looks like you (Black) who once ran up a thirty dollar bill and left a dollar tip. \nWAITRESS, over it, crosses frame and glares coldly at us. \nLionel takes a seat at a booth with Sam across from him. \nSAM (CONT'D) You watch all the other customers order before you do... \nWaitress huffs her way over to Lionel. \nLIONEL Pastrami sandwich on rye. \nSAM ...then proceed to wait no less than forty minutes for your food. \nA wall-clock advances forty, before the food and check come. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Pastiche? On Kurt Fletcher's staff? \nTROY You know to round out the res? \nDEAN FAIRBANKS I'll be God damned if twenty years from now you have to end up working for that dumb asses son. \nTROY (put in his place) Yes sir. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Fletcher and I graduated a year apart. He barely made it through. I graduated Summa cum Laude. Now look who's President and who's Dean. \nTROY What's the difference? \nDEAN FAIRBANKS A couple hundred grand a year. Understand what I'm saying? Now what happened between you and Sam to make her come after you anyway? \nTROY Sofia. You remember Sofia? Daughter of the President. Psych major. \"Has the world ahead of her Troy.\" \nDEAN FAIRBANKS I don't like your tone boy. \nTROY Sorry sir. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS So you lost the House. On to the school presidency then. \nThe light in Troy's eyes dims a bit. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) It'll be good to show this campus is capable of electing someone like you as school president. \nTROY Someone like me? \n33   INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT                                 33 \nTroy hovers over the toilet - smokes weed while the shower runs - exhales through his paper towel / dryer sheet apparatus. He jots down on a notepad and LAUGHS to himself. \nTROY'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME \nSofia has her face to the floor - peering underneath the bathroom door. She can see Troy's feet. What the hell? \nOff the SQUEAK of the shower being cut Sofia jumps up. \nMOMENTS LATER \nTroy bounds out the bathroom in his undies. Sofia on the couch pretends to have been watching television. \nTROY Babe. Hat or no hat? \nTroy stands before her in his undies holding a Kangol. He eyes her oversized T-shirt. \nTROY (CONT'D) Are you wearing that? \nSOFIA I don't have to be. \nSofia yanks Troy to her by his underwear to kiss his navel. \nSOFIA (CONT'D) Hey boo...why don't we put some of your new found free time to good use? It's been a while since... \nTROY What's with all this boo stuff? \nSOFIA ...since you fucked me with your big Black cock. \nTroy pulls away. \nSOFIA (CONT'D) It used to turn you on when I talked like that. Is it me? \nTROY (yes) I love you. \nSOFIA Is it Sam? \nTROY Can we please just, get ready? \nSOFIA Why? I hate my brother's friends. \nTroy thinks over his next words carefully. \nTROY You're not going to go with me? \nSOFIA You'd go without me? \nTroy tries to flash a charming shrug. \nSOFIA (CONT'D) You're my guest! \nSofia gathers some books and heads for the door. \nTroy deals cards at a table - the game is Texas Hold Em. Troy holds court - much to Kurt's chagrin. The mood is playful. There's a brief eye contact between Troy and Coco. \n39   INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              39 \nA huge \"Boycott Sal's Pizzeria\" poster hangs on the walls of Sam's chic dorm surrounded by other street art. The BoFros and a few cool residents of Armstrong / Parker hang about. \nUnderground hip hop permeates the room. Sam refuses a joint coldly from Reggie - her eyes fixed on \"SCHOOL DAZE\" which plays on her 36' flatscreen. \nSAM How `bout you stop stereotyping yourself and put that shit out? This ain't \"Friday.\" \nREGGIE Yo Sam. We got to talk about the protest. When are we are bringing the Housing fight to the prez? \nSungmi takes a seat next to Sam. Some kids hop up and start grooving it out when a new song pops up on the playlist. \nSUNGMI The House voted down sponsoring the rally. \nREGGIE What do we need it sponsored for? \nSAM Demonstrations can get shut down if a House doesn't sponsor them. \nREGGIE Like the House you're head of? \nSam shoots Reggie a glare. He backs off. \nSUNGMI Hey Sam, I read \"Ebony and Ivy.\" What's with the Oofta, Nose-Jobs, One Hundred stuff? I miss something? \nSam smiles. \nSAM You want me to break it down? \n40    INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  40 \nTroy deals another hand with Kurt, Mitch and Gordon. Troy's homeboy swag is thicker than usual. \nMITCH Yo my perfect Friday night is whiskey and my T-Bone Walker records, real talk. \nTROY Who the fuck is T-Bone Walker? \n40A   INTERCUT WITH SAM'S APARTMENT:                            40A \nSAM Only a few ways colored folks survive at a place like this. \nMITCH Uh only a pioneer of electric and jump blues bro. Know your roots. \nTROY White folks always be on stuff like decades too late and act like they discovered some shit. \nSAM \"Oofta\" is the jazz age term for Bojangle types who Blacked it up for White audiences. \nMITCH Don't sleep on T-Bone man. \nTROY Rock, Jazz, Blues - Nigga whatchu got on right now? \nMITCH Public Enemy my Nig-- \nTROY --Yo watch that man. \nGORDON You just called him -- \nTROY -- Ya'll get Country Clubs we get to say Nigga. \nEveryone at the table erupts in laughter. Except Kurt. \nGORDON And golf? And all our girls? \nTROY Whatchu mean all your girls? \nGORDON Dude, between OJ, Tiger, Wesley Snipes and uh, Troy over here... \nTROY Yo. It's a word for that. Reparations. \nMore Kurt-less laughter from the table. \nTROY (CONT'D) Forty white bitches and a mule. \nPerfectly executed. Troy grins as the table erupts. \nSAM An Oofta modulates his Blackness up or down depending on the crowd and what he wants from them. \nMITCH Kurt? \nKURT What? \nAs the impromptu party dies down... \nSUNGMI Okay and One Hundred? \nREGGIE Keeping it One-Hundred! Being Black as hell just cause. \nSam rolls her eyes. \nSUNGMI But what about just being you? \nSAM Like I said... \n44   INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT                                       44 \nLionel's got the eyes of the Bullpen on him. Annie's really warmed to him - her hands play with his afro. \nANNIE You don't mind do you? \nSAM (V.O.) There's only a few ways a person of a color can survive at a place like this... \nLIONEL Of course not. \nGEORGE Alright so then what? \nLIONEL So then Sam says \"What, is your daddy scared the Negroes are gonna start a rebellion on the plantation?\" \nGeorge goes CRAZY at this. \nGEORGE To Kurt Fletcher!? \nLIONEL Yeah. Yes. Yup. \nGEORGE We've got a news item but there's something bigger here. It's a profile piece on Armstrong / Parker and Sam White's pseudo revolution. \nANNIE What's the headline? \nLIONEL Outdated nationalist seeks purpose starts race war? \nLionel's joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it. \nThe image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES before Lionel briefly. \nGEORGE Beers in the corner. Bang out the news item tonight and we'll work on the profile piece for next week. \nLionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open computers. George starts up a beat on his desk as he and Annie stare at Lionel expectantly. \nLIONEL What are you doing? \nANNIE All Bugle staffer must freestyle. It's law. \nGEORGE You want to be a staffer right? \nLIONEL (awkward) My name is Lionel Kind of like a lion King of the jungle Indigenous to Africa... \nThe beat has long since stopped. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) Sorry. \n45   INT. KURT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                  45 \nTroy heads into the kitchen just as Kurt heads out. \nTROY Yo man, you know I wasn't talking about Sof back there with whole forty bitches thing. I was just -- \nKURT -- trying to get on my staff? \nTROY I never really thought about -- \nKURT -- Bullshit. Game Night is where we make our bids for the new staff. It's why everyone's here. You were practically about to bust out a tap dance. \nTROY I'm a Poly Sci major man. I just came to hang out. \nKURT My staff likes you. A lot. \nTROY But you don't. \nKURT This thing with you and Sof... \nTROY I'm good to her. \nKURT Our dad's have been playing a game of chess off and on since 1972. \nSAM How am I supposed to know how you feel about me? \nREGGIE You know what? Forgive me if I see something in you. Something inspiring. Something folks like me can get behind. \nReggie puts his hands on Sam's belt and pulls her in to a kiss as a group walks by. Over Reggie's shoulder Sam sees... \n...Gabe look back at her. He's heartbroken. She pretends not to be affected and sinks into a kiss from Reggie. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) Tell me you'll set up the rally. \nSAM I'll set up the rally. \n48   INT. KURT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                               48 \nKurt, Gordon, Mitch, Coco and Troy all trade glances. \nGORDON Are we sure about this? \nKURT It's ironic. Bold. And don't tell me I'm the only one who thinks Sam White's little movement needs to get cut down to size. \nAgreement Coco's gaze. Uncertainty in Troy's. \nKURT (CONT'D) Looks like you got your Hip Hop party Mitch. \nMITCH `Bout time. It's going to be huge man, fucking epic. \nKurt holds back a smile. \nKURT Boys, we've got a lot more mingling to do. We'll be in touch. And Troy? Get off the board bro. \nTroy chews on this as Kurt leads his group out. Troy smiles, goes to exit. \nTROY Nice seeing you. \nCOCO Where's Sofia? \nTROY I have no idea. \nCOCO Trouble in paradise? \nTroy shrugs and heads to the party. \nCOCO (CONT'D) Figures. (off Troy's incredulousness) Nothing. I'm sure you've got something else fair and petite and...fair lined up for that drink. \nTROY What's that supposed to mean? \nCOCO It's fine. I'm not even really into Black dudes anyway. \nTROY I'll have you know I'm an equal opportunity employer, okay? \nCOCO And what kind of jobs are you hiring for mister? \nCoco's stiletto rubs the side of Troy's calf. \nTROY Aren't you and Sofia -- \nCOCO -- I'm an accessory to Sofia. Can't ever shake the feeling I'm an assignment for that Afro Studies Minor of hers. \nTroy nervously glances out at the crowd and then back towards this dangerous and tempting creature before him. \nCOCO (CONT'D) I'm sure you have no idea what I mean. \n49   EXT. MANCHESTER YARD - NIGHT                                 49 \nLionel and George walk through the campus at night. George waves goodbye to Annie as they pass Bechet House. \nLIONEL She seems really cool. \nGeorge just smiles. \nGEORGE Did we go too far? You're in Armstrong/Parker right? \nLIONEL No. Garmin. \nGEORGE Fancy. \nLIONEL George I'm not exactly down with Sam and I'm not in the BSU. I got kicked out of Armstrong / Parker same as Kurt. But I'm going to write a good story, okay? \nGEORGE I hope so. I want a Bugle on your chest by the end of the month. \nLionel fights a smile as his heart beats through his chest. \nCoco's phone buzzes with a message. It's Kurt. \nCOCO (reading) We want you. Come by Ellington tomorrow at eight. (to Troy) Anything? \nTroy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy's eyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go. \nCOCO (CONT'D) You're going to have to stand up to him sooner or later Troy. \n52   EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY                          52 \nTroy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation marks her pretty face. \nSOFIA You said you loved me. \nTROY I like you a lot. \nSalt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her. \nSOFIA What do you do in the bathroom? When you leave the shower running? Was it just to get away from me? \nTroy wagers his answer and decides to confess. \nTROY I smoke weed and write jokes. \nPuzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia just turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as... \n...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before Troy turns to enter the house. \n53    INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME                     53 \nLionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He turns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other's gaze. \nAs they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that they're headed in the same direction. \n53A   UPSTAIRS                                                 53A \nLionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it with a key. Troy's already at the door when he looks up and realizes Lionel's just entered his apartment. \n54    INT. TROY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                           54 \nTROY The hell are you doing? \nLIONEL & TROY This is my apartment. \nTROY The hell it is. \nLIONEL The Dean said it was the only opening. \nTROY Head of House doesn't share. \nLIONEL But you're not Head of House. \nStill stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door leaving Lionel alone in the living room. \n57   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY                      57 \nLionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past and shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back. \nDREADS Stay Black, my brother. \nLIONEL Sure thing? \nLionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the entrance - suddenly chums. Troy's getting good news and gladly shakes Kurt's hand. \nKURT Need your submission by Thursday. \nTROY You got it bro. \nThe two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt. \nKURT The fuck? \nSam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her other support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed. \nTROY Yo! \nTroy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall. \nLionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam briefly who shares the same smirk. \nHe realizes Sam's actually looking at Reggie, perched behind him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Do you honestly think this is in the spirit of Armstrong / Parker house? \nSAM The role of the counter culture is to wake up the mainstream to -- \nDEAN FAIRBANKS -- I've got furniture older than you. Counter culture? Is that what you think this is? That show of yours? \nSAM What about my show? \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Your show is racist. \nSAM Black people can't be racist. \nThe Dean is rendered speechless at this statement. \nSAM (CONT'D) Prejudice? Yes. But not racist. Racism describes a system of disadvantage based on race. Black people can't be racist since they don't benefit from such a system. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Do you read the school papers? \nSAM Is the New York Times a school paper? \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Your antics are making press Sam and press like this keeps men like President Fletcher up at night. \nSAM Warm milk? \nDEAN FAIRBANKS He's building a file on you. \nSAM It's not my fault your son couldn't beat me in an election. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS I'm sure it was hard growing up. Wondering which side you fit into. Feeling like you have to overcompensate perhaps? \nSAM If that's true, I'm not the only one Dean. \nSam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank's last words resonate more than she'd like. \nGabe, making his way outside just catches her exit. \n59B   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                   59B \nHuge canvas signs with the words \"WHITES ONLY\" are strewn about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs. \nSam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the SUV. \nREGGIE There you are! We supposed to start at noon. \nSAM I told you I had class. \nThere's a vibration in Sam's pocket. Her phone says \"MOM.\" She cuts it off and picks up a \"white's only\" sign. \nREGGIE Those are going up on Gillespie. Good right? \nSam shrugs in the affirmative but it's too much. Reggie sees a doubt in her eyes. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) Yo. What's that? You're not getting cold feet are you? \nSAM No. I mean how long do I have to talk anyway? \nREGGIE You're kidding right? You're sort of the keynote. \nSAM Yeah but...you know I think the whole Malcolm X thing is your lane Reg. I'm just not -- \nREGGIE -- They came to hear you Sam. Grab a bullhorn. Turn it on. \nSam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to her phone. Sam checks: \"IT'S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME\" \nSam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe who's just happened upon the parking lot. \nGABE What is all this? \nSAM (on phone) Hey. In the middle of-- -- Okay. Okay. Okay. \nTears well up in Sam's eyes as she shakes her head no and heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe. \nWhen Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted look of indignation asks her what she's doing. \nREGGIE Sam? \nSam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie's heart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) Sam! \n60    INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY                           60 \nGABE Everything okay? \nSAM (happy tears) His condition's stable. \nGABE Good. That's good Sam. \nGabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again. \nSAM Gabe! \nGabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie... \nGABE What!? \n...and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down the heartbroken looks on her disciples' faces. \nSAM I'm sorry. \nAnd with that she closes the door right on Reggie. \n62   EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT                              62 \nCoco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing terrace atop the Library. They sip on coffee's. \nHELMUT New videos are picking up steam. \nCOCO Told you I was good TV. \nHELMUT The show I'm scouting for... It's called Black Face / White Place. It's reality. Like a \"True Life.\" Each episode centers on a different one of \"us\" in a sea of \"them.\" \nCOCO Interesting. \nHELMUT Interesting? You think they want interesting? Dignified stories of triumph and survival? (off Coco's naive shrug) They want the \"authentic urban experience\" which is basically network talk for bitching and weave snatching. I'm telling you this because the network is looking to take one of the subjects to series. I got one episode. One shot to find that subject. So if we do this... \nCOCO ...we do it all the way. I'm guessing Sam turned you down. \nHELMUT I think so. She called me a Bojangling Oofta, whatever that means. Everything else she said would've been bleeped on tv. (off Coco's laugh) So look, forty thousand hits on Youtube is good. It's not great. \nCOCO I'm about to get a whole lot more. \n63   INT. KURT'S HOUSE - DAY                               63 \nCoco sits before a video camera. The room is dim. \nKURT We don't have anyone like you on staff and you had a great idea. We brought you here to -- \nCOCO -- I want to MC it. Your party. \nKURT We're here to tell you what we want. \nCOCO You want me and in order to get me, you have to let me MC. (MORE) \nCOCO (CONT'D) And I want to do a live video blog from my Youtube account. \nBACK TO: \n64    EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY                              64 \nHELMUT They'd let you do that? \nCOCO They got no choice. They need me -- \nBACK TO: \n65    INT. KURT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                            65 \nCOCO -- cause without me ya'll look like a bunch of privileged assholes. \nKURT We don't let people video blog our events... \nCOCO ...You got a week to put this thing together boo boo. What's it going to be? \nCUT TO: \n66    EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY                              66 \nHelmut looks at Coco with a shocked gleam in his eye. \nCOCO You look surprised. \nHELMUT It's just... \nTroy and his father are alone. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS You didn't tell me you and Sofia had a misunderstanding. \nTROY Who did? \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Her father. She was very upset. (off Troy's silence) Troy. What sort of vision do you have for yourself? \nTROY Get my degree. Then Law School and then -- \nDEAN FAIRBANKS --And what's that got to do with partying with Kurt? With smoking weed and writing jokes? \nPanic flashes over Troy. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) Okay, so what? Is it the spotlight Kurt gets? You want to be on...tv or something? You know how many Black men waste their lives to get on TV? Be rappers and ball players? \nTROY (wanting it to be true) Dad no. I want what we always talked about. Maybe have my own firm someday? Run for office. Make a difference. Wife. Kids. I want all that. I really really do. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS And the drugs? God damn it Troy I taught you better than this. I have been in academia a long time, I've seen a lot of things. The men who really run this world? You got no idea what they see when they see you. You are not going to be what they all think you are. You will not give them that satisfaction, you hear me? \nTROY Yes sir. \n73   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                      73 \nSam steps out of Fletcher's office into the waiting room. Kurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other down as Kurt enters his father's office. \nA SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit the room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through the window. \nSam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and listens in. \nPRESIDENT FLETCHER I know about the party. You picked a hell of a time. \nKURT What party -- \nPRESIDENT FLETCHER -- You're cancelling Kurt. End of story. \n75   INT. BULLPEN - DAY                                        75 \nLionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over hears... \nGEORGE (O.S.) Lionel's story on the would-be protest outside of Gillespie is running tomorrow and I'm also having Lionel work on a profile piece of Armstrong/Parker like you suggested. Really break down what's going on. \nLionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a phone call. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Right. It's almost like they recycle so much from their past - Music, food, fashion, and now turbulence. \nThis leaves a bitter taste in Lionel's mouth. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Thank you so much. Okay, take care. \nGeorge can't fight his grin as he looks to Annie. \nANNIE Well? \nGEORGE That was our Times advisor. He said it's stories like these that get editors recommendation letters. \nLionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but reassured when they see who it is. \nLIONEL The Negro at the door didn't scare you this time. \nAnnie smiles and heads for the door. \nANNIE Lionel please. You're only technically Black. G, going to French. You want me to hold your seat? \nGEORGE Thanks. \nAnnie smiles and walks out. \nLIONEL You need something? Saw your e- mail. \nGEORGE Yeah, I need someone to do the Donor's function on Saturday. Small dinner for the school's big givers. Administration wants a little coverage. \nLIONEL That's Halloween night. \nGEORGE Right, which is why no one else will take it. \nLIONEL Ah. Thus the new guy. \nGeorge gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets close. \nGEORGE On my way to class, but you can stay and check out last year's piece. You'll do fine. \nKurt stumbles about the party in a daze. Drunk? Folks give him props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the others. His phone rings. \nKURT Yeah? \nINTERCUT \nCOCO Kurt, it's me. I can't do this. \nKURT Okay, I'm fucking confused. \n85    INT. SAM'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     85 \nLionel sits across from Sam. \nSAM What do you want me to do? Go over there and yell at them? \nLIONEL Have you heard you yelling? \nSAM This house is filled with folks willing to take up after a cause Lionel. Believe me. Never would have guessed you'd be one of them but... \nLIONEL For the first time in my life, I can't just sit around and do nothing. How can you? \nSAM If I'm caught being a part of anything like this...it wouldn't be good for me right now okay? \nLionel gets up and walks towards the door. \nSAM (CONT'D) I'm done being everybody's angry Black chick. \nSam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out. \nSam's focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and then to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks. \n86    INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT                        86 \nLionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining room - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other students mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER. \n86A   DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS                                    86A \nLionel gingerly walks in the room. He's still an outsider here - but something's changed in him. \nLIONEL Hey. How's it going. Hi. \nNo one answers him - just stay to their own conversations. Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) Hey...what is this? \nSUNGMI Black Student Union. \nLionel smiles shyly. He should've known that. \nReggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front. \nDREADS Your call then man. \nREGGIE (to everyone) Alright ya'll - thanks for coming out tonight. Looks like Sam's not making it so...let's just call it. \nThe crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think... \nLIONEL Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Lionel. Some of you...none of you probably know me. I've never been to a meeting. But I just came back from a party on campus and I think you should know about it. \nLionel's nerves can be heard in his voice now. He's got the judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an open laptop on a desk. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) Anybody mind if I? \nReggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel browses through the photos. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) I mean...I don't know. This is fucked up right? \nREGGIE Alright brother. What's the plan? \nLionel realizes the eyes aren't judging. They're mobilizing. Readying for action. Lionel steels himself. \nLIONEL We go over there. Now. \nCURLS Think there's enough of us? \nSUNGMI You know you don't have a monopoly on being a pissed off minority. Latino's United is meeting across the hall. Asian American League too. (off the stares) You guys got better snacks. \n87   INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT                                  87 \nTroy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads from the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses. \nLIONEL Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo! \nThe crowd is with it - thinks it's part of the show as Lionel proceeds to freestyle terribly... \nLIONEL (CONT'D) My name is Lionel, Some people call me Li. Lots of people think that I talk kinda white. Well that's alright. Yeah that's cool. I'd rather you think I'm white, than tap dance for you. \nWith that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over. \nSparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock. \nLionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground. Lionel's off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes Kurt away in his defense. \nGordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT. \nMore equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the party disintegrates into chaos. \nSam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera. \nArt is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on the ground. Arguments come to physical blows. \nThe steel in Sam's gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak? \nAnd then she spots... \n...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door. Sam's camera and mic stay trained on Coco. \nCOCO What? Say it. Come on. \nSam stays silent. \nCOCO (CONT'D) This may come as a shock, but these people don't give a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman. They pay millions of dollars on their tans, their lips, their asses, Jay- Z tickets, you name it, cause they wanna be us. (MORE) \nCOCO (CONT'D) So they got to be for a night.I'm not about to go out into the streets in protest of a Halloween party. \nSam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco realizes it's herself she's trying to convince. \nCoco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is new for her. Keeping her mouth shut. \n89   EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   89 \nCoco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her lashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night. \n90   EXT. KURT'S YARD - NIGHT                                    90 \nKurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the ground. \nKURT Dude. I know you can't help it... \nLionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down. \nKURT (CONT'D) ...but why are you such a fag dude? \nLionel spits in Kurt's face and pops right back up again. We see it in his eyes - he'll never give up. \nKurt's hand is on Lionel's collar. He pushes him down again. Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche - some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back. \nLionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt's eyes. Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard. \nLIONEL Finally got me where you want me. \nKurt's in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him. \nLionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt's let up. For a moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support. \nThe shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out. \nThe world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him. \nKids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard - One is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a couple POLICE OFFICERS surround him. \n91    INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    91 \nThe motor on Sam's Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a complete standstill. \nTroy enters and looks around in disbelief. Makes eye contact with Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer. \nDean Fairbanks enters and stands in the middle of the chaos. Sam tip toes in for a close up and holds out a small mic. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS What is all this? \n92    INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                      92 \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Who's this? \nKurt turns to a SUITED MAN next to him. \nKURT My lawyer. \nCUT TO: \n94B   We'll be cross cutting between several of these sessions. 94B \nCOCO So when I got the invite and saw everyone clicking \"yes\" I figured it was back on. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS You were hoping to make the staff? \nCOCO \nCUT TO: \nDEAN FAIRBANKS At what point in time did you show up to the event? \n94C   Sam sits with arms folded.                                  94C \nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) Samantha. Please. \nSAM Why am I even here? \nCUT TO: \nKURT 94              Guys throw parties at the house all               94 the time. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS We know you were planning this. \nKURT Your son tell you that? \nCUT TO: \n94D   Fairbanks stares down his son. Troy is silent and anxious. 94D \nDEAN FAIRBANKS (reading) \"...wishing you could sip on Henny out yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving you the side-eye?\" (and then) You write this Troy? \nTroy looks up at his father embarrassed. \nTROY No. Mine wasn't chosen. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS But you wanted to be? \nTROY What I wanted didn't matter then. Why should it matter now? I told you about the party, remember? \nCUT TO: \nDEAN FAIRBANKS 94              The invite came from the Pastiche               94 Facebook account. \nKURT I loathe Facebook. \nAn OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear. \nKURT (CONT'D) You've got to believe me. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS You've used that line on me before this year Mr. Fletcher. When a homophobic message mysteriously appeared on a voice mail line you shared with a roommate. \nCUT TO: \nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) What were your intentions when you went back the second time? \nLIONEL To stop it. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS By any means necessary? \nLIONEL Someone once told me...Manchester is like jazz. I don't know much about jazz. But from what I can tell, when your solo's up, you better blow. \nFairbanks fights a smile. \nCUT TO: \n94C                       SAM                                    94C All I did that night was hit record brother. \nThe Dean takes a gulp from a glass of water. He stands and looks out his huge windows onto the campus below. \nCUT TO: \n94E   The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. Officials    94E are taking a break. Drinking water. Discussing the day. \nGabe fights the urge to hug her. \nSAM We were actually on the phone last night for hours. First time we talked since the bypass. He was putting up a strong front. Teasing me about being so worried. Then came the stories about me as a little girl I'd heard a thousand times. About how independent I was. \nGabe smiles politely. Senses she needs a moment. \nGABE Want to talk about it? \nSAM My mother worked nights so he would take me to school. And it pissed me off because he would follow me all the way to homeroom. Every time he tried to hold my hand I'd scream and pull away. He thought I was just being...difficult. \nA hint of recognition in Gabe. Is this about them? \nSAM (CONT'D) But it was the kids. And the parents and the teachers. They'd see this Black girl and this white man and wonder what we were doing together. Even at nine I could feel their eyes on me. Especially at nine. It brought tears to my eyes. \nGabe's stone face melts at this. \nSAM (CONT'D) I was just a bratty girl, didn't know any better but-- The thought of losing him-- You know? I just feel so bad. How awful am I to do that to him? To anyone I love? \nGabe gets it. This is an explanation. An apology, to him. His arm is on her shoulder now. \nGABE I'm sure he forgives you. \nSAM Think so? \nGabe nods. Sam's normal defenses come back up lest she cries. \nSAM (CONT'D) So anyway. I didn't mean to say all of that. I don't know why I did. \nGABE Sam. Where are you going? \nSAM I don't know. Lunch? \nGabe starts to walk with her. \nGABE Isn't it Mac and Cheese day at Armstrong/Parker? \nSAM Think they'll let you in? \nGabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam lets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into each others' eyes. \nDon't even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by. \n98   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                                  98 \nCoco sits across from Helmut. He's got his eyes on a Youtube clip from Sam's movie featuring Coco. \nCOCO (YOUTUBE) I know this may come as a shock, but they don't give a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman... \nHELMUT Two hundred thousand views. Look they even auto-tuned it. \nWith a click Helmut pulls it up. \nAUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE) Muthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin Tubman! Don't give a fuck about no muthafuckin Tubman! \nCoco's not sure what to think. \nHELMUT Couple months, that's how long shooting for an episode takes. We recommend you cut your course load in half to accommodate the schedule. \nCOCO Half? \nHELMUT Trust me it it'll read \"full-time\" in the episode. If...once we go to series, we might have to figure out a summer schedule. \nCOCO For shooting? \nHELMUT For uh...classes and stuff. Won't be graduating early anymore sweetheart. \nHelmut shifts a contract over to Coco. \nHELMUT (CONT'D) Five grand for the episode. Twenty each if you get picked up for series. What do you say? \nCoco stares at the contract and back at Helmut. \nHELMUT (CONT'D) Trust me sweetie it's the same out there as it is in here. Good news is? Against all that damn white you and I? We pop. Think I wanted to be the go-to producer for all things Black? \nCoco shrugs. \nHELMUT (CONT'D) Tell you what's worse though. Being that broke Nigga stuck on the south side of Chicago. Hundred and Fiftieth street. \nCoco takes a deep breath. Stares right into his eyes -- \n99   EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY                                        99 \n", "test1_input": "REGGIE Yo Troy I forget. Is your major in shucking or was it jiving? \nTROY My major's in Jive. Minoring in Shuck. You're still majoring in trying to fuck my left overs right? \nTroy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia. \nSOFIA You need a shower. \n15   INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - DAY                                  15 \nWater runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over the toilet. He blows the smoke out an open window through a paper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. He jots something down on a notepad as he whispers... \nTROY You went from ODB to Trey Songz... \n16   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - NIGHT                   16 \nThe hall is packed with STUDENTS - stylish and mostly Black. Helmut West watches from the back. \nTROY Artie, you know your success ratio with the ladies went up like thirty percent after I started edging you up dog, come on. You went from ODB to Trey Songz! \nThe audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone except Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro'd bohemian disciples (who we'll call the BOFROS). Sam records the proceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera. \nREGGIE That's his platform? Haircuts? \nSAM Oofta is as Oofta does. \nCoco, sneaks through the door. She's got the eyes of Helmut on her. What is he doing here? As Coco breaks eye contact she sits in the only open spot next to... \nSAM (CONT'D) Just because we're colored don't mean we run on colored people time. \nCOCO Boycotting hot combs don't make you an expert on \"colored people\" boo. \nCoco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits. \nTROY No but seriously, I care about you guys. I care about this house. We had a great year last year and if it ain't broke... \nTroy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes. \nSam doesn't want to get up - her breathing gets heavier. \nREGGIE Just pretend like you're in the booth. Just you and the mic. \nSAM Hate this shit. \nAs Sam gets up and passes Troy -- \nTROY You really think you can take this from me? \nSAM Troy we live in a world where there's a Big Momma's House 3. I don't have a chance in hell. Thank God. \nSam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd. \nSAM (CONT'D) Troy my brother, it's broke. \nThe BoFros cheer and make noise on each line. \nSAM (CONT'D) Troy's a legacy kid. And yet it's under his watch that Armstrong / Parker, the bastion of Black culture here was gutted. By the Randomization of Housing Act. Second years of color no longer have a say in where they go. The culture that's been fostered in this house for two decades will be wiped out in two years. \nTroy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up -- \nSAM (CONT'D) This wasn't motivated by a desire to mix things up. Bring about racial and socioeconomic harmony. No, the Black kids are sitting together in the proverbial cafeteria and they must be up to no good. \nCoco's eyes are in the back of her head. \nSAM (CONT'D) We sit together to protect ourselves. Over a century of houses grouped by sports affiliations, political leanings, majors, you name it. Black folks get their own house, suddenly we got a problem? \nStudents look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy. \nSAM (CONT'D) This Act doesn't affect the other houses like it does ours. There are plenty of trustees, former coaches, and presidents watching out for the others. All we have is a Dean who'd rather please his massa -- \nTROY -- Yo that's enough of that Sam -- \nSAM -- then stand up for his own. Look, I know ya'll ain't voting for me. Ya'll ain't ready and I didn't come here for that. The Black Student Union and I have brought a petition to repeal the Randomization of Housing Act. I plan on bringing it to the President and together we can bring Black back to Manchester. It'll be by the door. \nSam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy - give her daps and all sorts of praise. \nMARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with neat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand. \nMARTIN I assume everyone has the app I created by now? \nREGGIE (aside) It's a child's app... \n", "test1_true": "Everyone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view as he punches something in. \nTroy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who give him a head nod. Troy's got this. After a moment... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Okay. Looks like we've got ourselves a winner. (devastated) Sam White? \nThe blood drains from Sam's face and Troy's smile plummets into the floor as the two turn to look at each other. \nTROY & SAM Oh shit. \nReggie's grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and slips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go. \n17   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                         17 \nRight on the heels of Helmut's exit is... \nCOCO So that's what you're looking for? \nHELMUT I'm looking for good TV sister. \nCOCO I think I'd be good TV. \nHELMUT You're at a great school, getting a great education. Be good at that. \nCOCO I am. And when I graduate early with an Economics degree from Manchester it will be the crowning achievement of my Black middle class parents' ambitions. \nHELMUT Conflict is a commodity in my industry. Sam's got it. Do you? \nCOCO So you want me to start a fight. \nHELMUT (exactly) I don't want you to do anything you wouldn't otherwise do. \nHelmut hands her his card. A fire sparks in Coco as he exits. He contemplates her. Fights a growing smile. \n18   INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                    18 \nA fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while the message plays over speaker phone. \nSPEAKER ...bigger the dick the less you'll have to pay me to ssssuck it. \nDean Fairbank's mind ticks away behind a concerned glare. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Most everything's locked up, but we'll find another residence to move you to. Third time's a charm. (off Lionel's sigh) What about Armstrong / Parker? \nLIONEL I don't know... \nDEAN FAIRBANKS I might have an opening. Maybe it'd be good to be around...you know. \nLIONEL Dean. The worst thing about high school, and believe me it was a long list, were the Black kids. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Maybe it's in your head. Sure, sometimes our folks can be intolerant around people like you. Homo -- \nLIONEL -- I don't believe in labels. \nFairbanks just smiles. This is a sore spot and he backs off. \nLionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank's desk: Students of all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy with the phrase \"MANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG\" printed below. Troy's huge smile seems to mock him. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS You like jazz Lionel? Manchester's like jazz you know. \nLIONEL This is a research school. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS And jazz is tension. The interplay of improvised solos all creating one song. Your problem is you've got no instrument. No major, no affiliations, no solo son. \nLIONEL I submit articles to the Independent Observer. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS No one reads the Independent Observer, my point is are you playing swing or bebop? \nLIONEL You're mixing metaphors. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS Are you a sax or are you a trumpet? \nLIONEL I hate jazz. \nFairbanks checks his watch. All out of ideas. \nDEAN FAIRBANKS I'll do what I can. Not a word of this in the Observer okay? \nLIONEL What's it matter? No one reads it. \n", "test1_id": 2895, "test2_input": "SAM -- Look this thing might as well be my right hand Professor.

Watches Housewives of Atlanta? The same homogenized images of Black people over and over again? White people Gabe. \nGABE Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies? \nSAM We're an underfed community.

My sweater so big. I told you about that? \nSam's phone buzzes. Gabe grabs it and sees Reggie's photo pop up. He swallows his envy and hands it to Sam. She doesn't answer.

Never took you as a student politician... \nReggie's photo again - New Voicemail. A regret in Sam's eyes. \nSAM Yeah, well... \nSam rolls out of bed. Gabe thinks twice before he asks it. \nGABE Sam?

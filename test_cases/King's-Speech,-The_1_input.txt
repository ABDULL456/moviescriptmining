53   INT. LOGUE'S STUDY - NEW DAY                               53 
Bertie stands shattered, lost in his painful memory. 
BERTIE I couldn't say anything! 
LIONEL You could've refused. Don't you know any rude words? 
BERTIE What a bloody stupid question! I just said one. Bloody. Bloodybloodybloody! 
LIONEL Perhaps a touch more vulgar? 
BERTIE Certainly not. 
LIONEL To prove you know how. 
BERTIE Bugger! 
LIONEL A public school prig could do better. 
BERTIE Well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard! 
LIONEL Hardly robust. 
BERTIE Shit then. Shit, shit, shit! 
LIONEL See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue? You don't stutter when you swear. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                 57. 
BERTIE Because I'm angry! 
LIONEL Get angry more often. Do you know the f- word? 
BERTIE Fornication? 
LIONEL Oh Bertie... 
BERTIE Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck! 
LIONEL Bravissimo! Now a resounding chorus of... 
BERTIE Bloody, bloody. bloody! Shit, shit, shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck! 
A pounding on the wall. 
MYRTLE (O.S.) We have children...! 
BERTIE (whispers) This is your fault! 
LIONEL Sorry, pet! Won't happen again! 
MYRTLE (O.S.) I should hope not! 
BERTIE Apologies, Mrs. Logue. 
LIONEL First time I've heard you laugh. 
BERTIE Royals aren't allowed emotions in public. 
LIONEL Which explains a lot. 
Bertie is in no mood to be provoked. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    58. 
BERTIE What do you want me to do, dammit!? Stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta?! 
LIONEL Your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed. 
Without thinking, Lionel instinctively reaches out to pat Bertie supportively on the shoulder. 
Bertie pulls back in offended shock.   All the warning signals instilled in him are going off. 
BERTIE Don't take liberties! You're a dangerous man, Logue. Who sent you? 
LIONEL Anyone in mind? 
BERTIE The lurking shadows. Courtiers and peers...the whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world, afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is further debased. 
LIONEL Your wife was the one who sought me out. 
BERTIE Because, dear sweet deluded woman, she believes in me! 
LIONEL But you don't share her belief? Why come here? 
BERTIE I'm beginning to ask myself that very same question. Your sailing close to the edge, don't push me, Doctor Logue.

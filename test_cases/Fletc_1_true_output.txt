MR. UNDERHILL Mrs. Stanwyk! 
162 INT. BATHROOM 
MRS. STANWYK In a minute! 
FLETCH He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true. 
MRS. STANWYK How do you know about that? 
FLETCH He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad. 
MRS. STANWYK What does all this mean? 
FLETCH Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout? 
MRS. STANWYK Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --- 
FLETCH Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush. 
MRS. STANWYK But I've seen the deed. 
FLETCH You saw a forgery. 
He takes out his photographs. 
FLETCH That's the real deed. 
162-A INSERT - PHOTO OF DEED 
It's is so fuzzy, shaky, and poorly framed that there's no way we can read the price on it. 
FLETCH (O.S.) Now, if this were at all legible, you'd believe me. 
162-B MASTER 
Fletch shows her more of the photos. 
FLETCH Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented.... 
MRS. STANWYK Stop it. (angry and concerned) Are you saying my husband is defrauding me? 
FLETCH I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true. 
Mrs. Stanwyk stares at Fletch. She gets a little teary. 
FLETCH I'm really sorry I have to tell you all this. 
MR. UNDERHILL (O.S.) Mrs. Stanwyk? 
MRS. STANWYK (really screams) Just wait, all right?!? (to Fletch) I'm going to call my father. He'll know what --- 
Fletch stops her. 
FLETCH No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me. 
MRS. STANWYK Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know. 
FLETCH Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan? 
Gail is now teary, confused, and scared. 
MRS. STANWYK No...I've got to go to Mr. Underhill.... 
FLETCH I'll take you to a game. 
MRS. STANWYK What are you talking about? 
FLETCH I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game. 
MRS. STANWYK Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours? 
FLETCH (climbing out window) Act natural. 
MRS. STANWYK I was afraid you'd say that. 
FLETCH If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?

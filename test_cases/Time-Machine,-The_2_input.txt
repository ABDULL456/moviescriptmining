Smiling. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE It vas reassuring to find that she hadn't changed.  Only her costume. Provocative to say the least.  I wondered what she would look like ten years hence. 
With a grin he throws the lever forward. 
INSERT OF DIALS                                        114 
HUMMING INCREASES and the years spin; 1960, 1961 and so on until it finally STOPS on 1966. 
BACK AT THE MANNEQUIN                                  115 
Dressed in the sleek dress of the future.  First a distant, then a close AIR RAID SIREN HOWLS, menacingly. 
BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 116 
His smile becomes a puzzled stare at what he sees. 
EXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117 
People are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder. 
The running is purposive, however.  All are entering particular buildings or, like those closest to the Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky- ward. 
A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers her up in his arms and rushes back to safety. 
In a few seconds the streets are deserted. 
TIME MACHINE AT EDGE OF PARK - FULL SHOT               118 
The Time Traveller gets out and looks around, confused. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE At first I wondered if my Machine and I were the cause of the panic.  I was to soon find out we weren't. 
He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair- way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s., a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly, until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's attention. 
EXT. STORE WINDOW - FULL SHOT                          119 
A TELEVISION CABINET on display.  The set is operating, showing a huge symphony orchestra led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow. The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors fly wide open. 
He stops startled, looking about to see who opened them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LONG SHOT                      120 
From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller enters and turns his attention to other products of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks off. 
REVERSE SHOT                                           121 
Coming from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian Defense."  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller. 
TIME TRAVELLER (shakes his head) I can't understand you. 
The warden takes off his helmet.  He is David Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young man.  He is now in his mid-sixties. 
WARDEN (looking at helmet) Confounded radio in this thing. Makes more noise than it does sense. 
TIME TRAVELLER (recognizing him) Filby! 
WARDEN My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't you hear the air raid siren? 
TIME TRAVELLER You mean that horrible screeching? 
WARDEN It wasn't constructed for its aesthetic values, you know, but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter.  Now go on. 
TIME TRAVELLER But I'm perfectly comfortable and I find your store magnificent.  What splendid achievements, what gigantic strides mankind has taken, what... 
WARDEN (interrupting) Come on, young man.  We'd better be going before the mushrooms start sprouting. (looks at Time Traveller with renewed interest) You do look familiar.  Haven't we met somewhere before? 
TIME TRAVELLER Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many years ago.

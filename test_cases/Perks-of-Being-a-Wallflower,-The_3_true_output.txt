CHARLIE What do the players call a puck again? 
FATHER A biscuit. 
CANDACE Are you sure it's not a "God damn biscuit?" 
FATHER You're cruisin' for a bruisin'. 
As things return to normal, dad picks up his paper. Candace talks about the books she'll need for college. Everyone starts eating. And Charlie smiles, happy to just be home. 
181   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK                                   181 
Ding dong.    The door opens to reveal Patrick, smiling. 
PATRICK Can Charlie come out and play? 
Charlie's mother smiles. Charlie smiles, too. Especially when he sees... Sam. Standing next to Patrick. Her hair a little different. Her eyes alive and happy. 
182   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          182 
The gang of three sit at their booth. Sam and Patrick have their coffee. Charlie has his brownie. Like always. 
SAM That first night, I had grilled stickies. It was so good. You have to visit in the Fall. We'll have some. Okay? 
CHARLIE Definitely. 
PATRICK Sorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown scheduled for October. 
Charlie laughs.   Sam smiles.   After a beat... 
SAM Well, can I tell you something? I've been away for two months. It's another world. And it gets better. (off Charlie's smile) And my roommate Katie has the best taste in music. 
Sam puts a cassette tape down on the table. 
SAM (CONT'D) I found the tunnel song. 
Charlie looks at Sam and Patrick, who smile. 
SAM (CONT'D) Let's drive. 
183   EXT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                            183 
The three leave the restaurant and jump into Sam's truck. Patrick drives. Charlie in the middle. Sam the passenger. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate. So, if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school. And you helped me. 
184   INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                        184 
The three friends are flying down the highway in Sam's truck. The music blaring. The wind making their hair dance. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Even if you didn't know what I was talking about. Or know someone who's gone through it. It made me not feel alone. 
With Sam's help, Charlie climbs through the little window 
185   EXT. HIGHWAY 376 NORTH - NIGHT                                   185 
Charlie gets into the back of the truck. He sits down, looking back at the highway. Watching everywhere he's been. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Because I know there are people who say all of these things don't happen. And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17. 
We see Charlie in profile.   The night sky behind him until... 
186   INT. FORT PITT TUNNEL - NIGHT                                    186 
... they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast they're driving. The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at blinding speed. A perfect night. A perfect drive. Flying. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now, these moments are not stories. 
Charlie turns to face forward. To the moment.   To Sam, smiling at him from the front seat. 
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D) This is happening. I am here. And I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. 
Sam kisses Charlie. Then, she turns, and all three kids look ahead to everything in front of them. Charlie begins to stand in the back of the truck. Ready to leave the tunnel.

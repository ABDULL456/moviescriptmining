FATHER LAURENCE Balthasar? 
BALTHASAR 
(DESPERATELY) I brought news of Juliet's death... And then in post came Romeo from 
MANTUA To this same place... to this same monument. 
CLOSE ON: Father Laurence. 
FATHER LAURENCE How long hath he been there? 
BALTHASAR Full half an hour. 
Father Laurence turns towards the mausoleum. 
FATHER LAURENCE Romeo. (a shock of realisation) The lady stirs... 
INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
TRACK SLOW TOWARD: Juliet: Sobbing uncontrollably she prises the gun from Romeo's hand. 
EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
Father Laurence, desperate, breaks through the police line and runs toward the mausoleum. 
CUT TO: The parents and Captain Prince. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE Hold! Go not forth! 
INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
Juliet turns the gun on herself. 
EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
CLOSE ON: Father Laurence, he screams as he mounts the mausoleum stairs. 
FATHER LAURENCE The lady stirs! 
CRACK! The sound of a single gun shot rips through the night. 
CUT TO: Captain Prince. 
CUT TO: The parents, a look of cold shock. 
CUT TO: The priest - his cry echoes through the night. 
INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
Juliet lies peacefully on Romeo's chest. Her eyes awake. A wash of deep red blood floods across them both. As we move away from the forms of the two young lovers lit by a ring of candles, the police burst in, guns ready to resolve what has already been resolved. Continuing up, we pass through the glass dome of the viewing chapel, and over the building. 
EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
There, huddled at the base of the Mausoleum steps, are the Montague and Capulet parents and Father Laurence. 
From high up we see Captain Prince emerge from the Mausoleum and speak to the group. A moment, then their cries float gently up. 
EXT. SKY. NIGHT. 
We are travelling high into the sky now. The cries of the parents and the buzz of radio calls fade to nothing. 
EXT. VERONA BEACH STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT-FROM AIR. DAWN. 
As the sun struggled to rise, we push toward the figure of Jesus silently surveying the city. 
EXT. VERONA BEACH - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAWN. 
As Jesus' face fills the screen, droplets of water begin to streak his cheeks. 
HOLD: Music swells; the droplets grow to a torrent, and a heavy rain begins to fall. 
For a long beat, we stay with this image. 
CRANE DOWN: From the Jesus. A sea of black umbrellas stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower. 
EXT. FREEDOM TOWER. DAY. 
At the top of the steps are a pair of flower strewn caskets. Before the caskets stand Fulgencia and Gloria Capulet, and Ted and Caroline Montague. They stare with blank, uncomprehending sorrow. 
Among the crowd we see the distraught faces of Benvolio, Balthasar, Father Laurence and the Nurse. 
The caskets are gently slid into a pair of long black cars. Montague and Capulet descend the stairs. Captain Prince blocks their path. He holds them in his gaze. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love; And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished. 
The Prince steps aside. The procession moves off. Montague and Capulet look to one another, a moment, and then the two adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children. 
AERIAL SHOT: The rain falls. Two black cars lead the people of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade. 
As the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of Jesus, the image pixilates into a television picture.

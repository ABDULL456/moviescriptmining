SAL (V.O.) Well, if you can't do better than that, you can stick the cups. 
EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD (HUNTS POINT AND EAST RIVER) - DAY 
HIGH ANGLE: Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE walking slowly together toward the camera.  They are at the auto graveyard and the scene of an auction of cars towed off New York streets by the Police Department.  About twenty other men are walking around, looking at the cars. 
A POLICEMAN blows a whistle and the prospective car buyers gather around the auction trailer in the b.g. 
LA VALLE There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month. 
MARIE Just for mistakes of parking? 
LA VALLE No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier. 
MARIE (off camera) Darling, may I have this one? 
Medium close shot MARIE, standing next to an LTD. 
MARIE It looks so lonesome here. 
CHARNIER and LA VALLE approach her. 
CHARNIER It would look even more lonesome in our garage. 
INT. THE AUCTION TRAILER - DAY 
Within the large trailer, about TWENTY MEN are seated at two long benches to each side.  Some are standing to the rear. At the front, an AUCTIONEER stands at a lectern.  To his left sits a CLERK at a small table.  The AUCTIONEER wears a sweater and hat.  The buyers are tough types, young and old. All have inventory lists.  The atmosphere is informal.  The CHARNIERS and LA VALLE enter the trailer at the back. 
AUCTIONEER Every car sold today must be removed at the purchaser's own expense.  We have no keys or anything to start the vehicles with. You buy 'em as you see 'em and where you see 'em.  All right, the first car offered is Number 24398. A Plymouth sedan.  Do I hear fifteen dollars? 
The bidding goes up to forty dollars.  A large BURLY MAN wins the bid.  He goes up to the CLERK and accepts the bill of sale. 
AUCTIONEER We go to 24399 -- A Pontiac Station wagon.  Do I hear ten dollars? 
LA VALLE (aside to CHARNIER) Notice he will never mention the year of the car. 
AUCTIONEER I got a fifteen dollar bid going... Do I hear anymore... Eighteen... who'll say Eighteen? Twenty... Twenty-three... Anymore... Twenty-five.  Twenty-five once -- Do I hear twenty-eight... All right, last call for twenty- five...

Vanger nods again; is silent for several moments ... VANGER Someone in the family murdered Harriet and for the last forty years has been trying to drive me insane. 33   OMIT:   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - DAY       33 34   EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DUSK                      34 
The 4:30 train leaves the station without Blomkvist. 35   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DUSK                                35 
Anna gathers the cups and leaves with the tea tray. VANGER It was September 21st, 1966.    A Saturday. Harriet was 16. 
36   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY - 1966                           36 
Three generations of Vangers dot the grounds. 
VANGER V/O My brothers - along with their wives, children and grandchildren - had gathered here for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner. It was also the day the Yacht Club held its Autumn parade. 
37   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY - 1966                                37 
And we see the parade, and, among the spectators lining the town's main street, Harriet with other teenage girls. 
VANGER V/O Harriet and a couple of school friends had gone into town to watch it. She returned a little after two o'clock. 38   INT. VANGER'S PARLOR - DAY - 1966                         38 
A clock in the room reads, 2:10.    Vanger and a few family members sip afternoon cocktails.    Harriet appears. 
VANGER V/O She came to the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important, but I told her to give me a few minutes. She leaves.   He returns to the others in the room. 
VANGER V/O But in a few minutes, before I could go upstairs to talk to her, something else occurred. 
39   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1966                           39 A car and a fuel truck, both going too fast, collide on the bridge. The truck rolls onto its side crushing the car and spewing gasoline. VANGER V/O The accident had nothing to do with Harriet - and everything. 
40   INT. VANGER'S FAMILY ROOM - DAY - 1966                    40 
Vanger and the others react to the noise of the crash. Out the large window they can see the bridge and many of those on the grounds trotting down to get a closer look.

ALEX Hard left! 
She makes the left. 
NATALIE I'll sound like a flake.   I can't stand flakes. 
DYLAN He will so give you the second chance. 
NATALIE You think? 
DYLAN Hello, I saw the way he looked at you. 
One motorcycle charges, coming up just feet from the windshield. Natalie taps on the brakes. The freaked out guy can't slow down in time. He SMACKS into the windshield, then goes flying. 
ALEX We're at the bottom! 
Indeed, we are. The concrete walls end, leaving open ground. Slamming on the brakes, Natalie turns the van around. Everyone goes flying. Bosley is still on the phone with Charlie. 
EXT. BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT 
Back facing the right direction, the van charges onward. The motorcycles race up to the passenger side, grabbing for the door. 
INT. THE VAN - NIGHT 
Dylan SLAMS open the door, knocking one RIDER off. 
The sliding door opens, another RIDER outside trying to get in. Thinking fast, Knox grabs Bosley's tuba and shoves it at the motorcyclist, who tumbles, taking out the fourth rider in the process. 
DYLAN (genuinely impressed) Well done. 
KNOX Thanks.

thunders over.    We are... 
INT. THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
Natalie is at the controls, Bosley beside her.      Alex leans forward from the second row. 
BOSLEY I think that went very well. Charlie should send me on more missions. 
ALEX We couldn't have done it without you, Bos. 
Natalie pats him on the arm. She and Alex exchange a quick glance. They have to just laugh. 
In the back row, Knox is looking out over the gorgeous lights of Aspen. 
DYLAN Cocktail? 
She offers him an airplane-sized bottle of Johnnie Walker black. He takes it and toasts. They both down their drinks in a single shot. A smile, and then... 
MUSIC rises. 
THE ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends. 
The act is over.    After a beat, we

Re-establishing. 
INT. CHARLES TOWNSEND DETECTIVE AGENCY - (THE NEXT) DAY 
Charlie is on the speakerphone.      The angels are in their usual lounging positions. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Good work, Angels. Not only did you save Knox, you saved his company as well. 
DYLAN I think that earns us a vacation. 
NATALIE Say, Fiji?

ALEX (to Natalie) Any special guy you were thinking of inviting? 
Natalie grins a guilty smile. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Sorry, Angels.     Our work is only half-done.

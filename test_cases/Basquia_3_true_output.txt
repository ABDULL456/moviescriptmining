Andy's back is turned to him. As Jean gets closer, he sees that Andy's assistant FRANK is peeing on canvas covered with copper pigment. We hear the SOUND of the piss. 
Frank holds a bottle of beer in his hand. 
ANDY WARHOL A little more to the right, Frank. OK... Good. Now up... You got a little more? 
Jean notices a bunch of Andy's wigs on a desk. 
BASQUIAT What's with the wigs? 
ANDY WARHOL I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents. 
BASQUIAT You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig? 
Jean makes a grimace. He walks up to the painting Frank's peeing on. 
BASQUIAT Piss painting? 
ANDY WARHOL I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green. 
BASQUIAT How come you're not peeing on them yourself? 
ANDY WARHOL I don't like beer. 
Looking down at the painting - 
BASQUIAT If you ever want me to shit on 'em, just ask. You could finger paint. 
INT. THE FACTORY - LATER 
Jean and Andy collaborate on a large canvas. Andy outlines a Mobil Oil winged horse. 
Jean paints it out. To the side he paints a penguin with a hat. 
ANDY WARHOL That was my favorite part! 
BASQUIAT We can do better. It needed more white. 
Andy watches as Jean lights a joint and continues working on his penguin. 
ANDY WARHOL Jean, you make me feel worthless. You're so famous. 
Andy paints an Amoco logo next to the penguin. 
BASQUIAT I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? 
That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you." 
ANDY WARHOL Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you. 
BASQUIAT People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work. 
Jean paints out part of Andy's logo. 
ANDY    WARHOL Bruno called. In    Europe, people are saying you're gonna die    from drugs. They think they can cash in    on your death. 
BASQUIAT When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now. 
Jean obliterates Andy's logo. 
ANDY WARHOL If you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m. You call at four in the morning. You never show up anywhere on time - if you show up. You're painting out everything I do! 
Andy paints back in part of the horse. 
BASQUIAT That's better. 
Jean adds some letters on top of Andy's logo. 
ANDY WARHOL I can't even see what's good anymore. 
Jean Michel obliterates the rest of the logo with some white. 
Andy steps back and squints as he examines Jean's work. 
ANDY WARHOL (CONT'D) Yeah, I see what you mean about the white. It's better. 
Jean quits painting. 
BASQUIAT After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what 
I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.

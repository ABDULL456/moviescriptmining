Marion closes the journal. 
MARION He has no respect for citizen soldiers.  That's your bait... militia. 
Washington nods, considering it. 
EXT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN - EVENING 
Under fire.  Cornwallis and his staff.  Major Halbert strides in and gives Cornwallis a dispatch. 
MAJOR HALBERT Sir, a dispatch from General Clinton made it through the rebel lines. 
Cornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it.  It staggers him.  He sits down. 
WILKINS Sir? 
Cornwallis fumes.  His jaw sets with anger.  He slowly crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury. 
CORNWALLIS Call a general staff meeting. 
AIDE Yes, sir. 
EXT.  YORKTOWN - PRE-DAWN 
Marion stands at the American battlements, looking out at the British defensive works.  Above him, stars are visible, but they're fading in the light of the pre-dawn glow from the horizon. 
Marion scans the disappearing stars, searching out the NORTH STAR, but in the increasingly harsh light of this day, he can't find it.  He turns his eyes back to the battlefield. 
EXT.  YORKTOWN BATTLEFIELD - DAY 
The sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility to a few dozen yards.  Men move like ghosts. 
THE CAMERA finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist. There is no overview, just separate detachments: 
An orderly regiment of CONTINENTAL CAVALRY, mounted, waiting, steadying their horses. 
Two long lines of CONTINENTAL INFANTRY RESERVES... 
An American Command, including Washington, LaFayette and two dozen staff officers, attended by riders and runners... 
And, finally, MARION AND HIS MEN, who stand in the middle of a long line of Patriot militia in the center of a long, valley-line depression. 
They stand silently, unable to see anything other than each other and the gently slope of the dew-covered grass in front of them. 
They're all grim.  They know what's coming. 
Then, the SOUND OF A SINGLE DRUM, heard but unseen, coming from over the slope... 
Then, MORE DRUMS, more and more, A COMPETITION OF DRUM BEATS... 
Marion's men listen, turning their heads, trying to imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in front of them. 
MARION MOTIONS FOR HIS OFFICERS, Dalton, Scott, Rev. Oliver and several other Patriot militia officers from other units.  They quickly gather around. 
MARION The British army believes in officers.  I believe in soldiers. After we engage, there will be no more orders.  Every man here must know what I'm about to tell you. 
They listen closely. 
MARION We are the bait in a trap.  We're militia.  Cornwallis thinks we're rabble, nothing more than a bunch of undisciplined farmers.  And if he thinks that's what we are, that's what we're going to give him. Listen up. 
They gather around closer. 
EXT.  BRITISH LINES - DAY 
Cornwallis, surrounded by his staff officers, including Tarleton, stands on a low hill, trying, with the aid of a spyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as the morning mist begins to burn off. 
Through the fog, he just makes out the American lines.  He turns to Tarleton who also peers through a spyglass. 
CORNWALLIS Do you see that, Colonel? 
TARLETON Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center. 
Cornwallis and Tarleton exchange a pleased look. 
EXT.  LOW MEADOW - YORKTOWN - MORNING 
Marion and his men wait. 
A STRANGE SOUND.  Soft, muted.  The men turn their heads, listening, their eyes shifting. 
They hear the SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON WET GRASS, advancing... 
THE CAMERA WATCHES THE FACES OF MARION AND HIS MEN as they listen to an unseen army approaching. 
ON MARION'S FACE we see him hearing every sound and we see FLASH CUTS of what he knows he's hearing: 
The BOOTS OF THE UNSEEN SOLDIERS... 
Shouldered muskets CLICKING against pack buckles... 
SILENCE at a stop... 
MORE DRUMS... 
The men around Marion wait. 
THEN, THEY SEE IT... 
A MASSIVE WALL OF RED appears over the rise in front of them... 
Thousands of Redcoats, in perfect formation, marching in lockstep, straight for them. 
Marion sees the fear on his men's faces, but none of them move... 
The BRITISH DRUMS GROW LOUDER AND LOUDER... it's almost enough to drive a man to flight... almost. 
The CAMERA explores the faces of Marion's men, faces that we know, Rev. Oliver, Scott, Abner, Marion.  All are frightened but all are motionless.

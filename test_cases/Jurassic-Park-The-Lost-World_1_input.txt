JUTTSON I want to see the nesting ground! 
Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile, wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera. Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group continues on into the bush after the animals. 
IN THE BUSH, 
the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson, who is beside her. 
SARAH Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't see an egg clutch... 
She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field glasses. 
JUTTSON (whispering back) The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive! 
SARAH Not without a shot of the nest. 
She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it, using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the other two. 
Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the clearing. 
IN THE CLEARING, 
Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back, toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south. She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd, ever better as she gets closer. 
BACK AT THE HILL, 
the others can only watch her, aghast. 
NICK She's gutty. 
MALCOLM She's nuts. 
IN THE CLEARING, 
Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture after picture from this ideal vantage point. 
She shoots the last picture on the roll -- 
-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her hands. 
Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and starts to move away, slowly. 
The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah leaps back at the last second -- 
-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was. 
Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly for animals their size. 
The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts right up off the ground. 
It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them. 
The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them. 
Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting into position behind the second. 
Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating. 
The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING to the jungle floor. 
The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath the animals! 
Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest the jungle around them. 
The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group. 
There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest. 
A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY, 
the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and throws her arms around him, exhilarated. 
SARAH Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad! 
JUTTSON (out of breath) Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY 
Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and blows it out. 
SARAH No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact. 
MALCOLM That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change. 
Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a sharpie, to label it. 
NICK What should I call this?  "Jurassic Pork?" 
Eddie, next to him, laughs. 
SARAH (still to Malcolm) And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible. 
JUTTSON I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.

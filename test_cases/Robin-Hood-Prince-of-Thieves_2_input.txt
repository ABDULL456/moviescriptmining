MARIAN Who is there?     Duncan! 
INT. DUBOIS MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT Marian enters stealthily. A candle in one hand, a drawn dagger in the other. Something leaps at her!... A cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. She shoos him down. MARIAN Off, Nicodemus. Go find mice. She sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind.   A masked SOLDIER. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: SOLDIER We meet again. He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his mask -- the man who attacked her earlier. He prods her with his sword. SOLDIER Drop your blade. MARIAN You are still overmatched, soldier. She drops the sword. He hurls her against the table. Lays his blade against her chest. 
SOLDIER You owe me favors, wench. Bare your breasts... or I will do it for you. Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face. Screaming, he grabs his  face. She reaches for her dagger. He slashes with   his sword. She backs to the fireplace, grabs a spit  of roasted chickens... drives the point clean through  his chest. He stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the cooked fowls pinned to his breast... FOOTSTEPS... masked soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging the servants. Duncan  is shoved through the door. DUNCAN I am sorry, my lady.    There were too many. She stares at the invaders with studied calm. MARIAN Is there something you need, gentlemen? I remember no masked ball on my calendar. CUT TO: 
AERIAL SHOT FLYING LOW OVER treetops, OVER an expanse of green, intersected by brown roads and tracks. We are LOOKING AT a detailed scale model of Sherwood Forest in... 
INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - NIGHT The Sheriff and SIX BARONS are gathered around the model. These are the men who revealed their faces to Lord Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with a white rat on his arm. REDHEAD BARON Forget about Locksley. He is no threat. NOTTINGHAM How can we control all England if we cannot control our own county? The people are turning him into a hero. 
GREYBEARD BARON It is impossible to attack him in the forest. We have tried everything. He is cunning. NOTTINGHAM Then we   will be more cunning. I must be   rid of him. We may not be able   to intercept his next warning   to the King. Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open. Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor. His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable ferocity in his eyes. CELTIC CHIEFTAIN I want the heads of the men who stole my gold. 
NOTTINGHAM Welcome, sir. We were discussing how to rid ourselves of those very men. The outlaws who band with Robin Hood. REDHEAD BARON My Lord Nottingham, I must protest. It is a mistake to ally ourselves with foreigners. GREYBEARD BARON What can these Celts do that we cannot? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Chieftain strides across to the fire. Grabs a burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log spits sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head... and drives it into his own palm. He stares unblinking at the Baron, holding the log to his hand for a full three seconds. An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted with the demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model. NOTTINGHAM This rat Hood has hidden out in the forest.  He resists all our assaults with traps and devices, while he robs us blind. We must bring him out and destroy him. The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees. The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated. DISSOLVE TO:

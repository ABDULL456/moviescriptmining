But she can see him. From behind the door, she comes out swinging a bat. Burnett ducks and Julie smashes the hat stand instead. (CONTINUED)

BURNETT What do you mean I'm not Mike Lowrey? You never even met him! Me. JULIE The way Max described you was different. 
BURNETT I'm undercover. She doesn't believe him and swings the bat. BURNETT Okay.    I'm way undercover. JULIE Prove it! BURNETT I knew her from way back. From time to time, you know... We'd get together. Mess around, you know? JULIE Wrong. Julie swings for real, nearly taking Burnett's head off. 
BURNETT Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated. It's a man thing. She swings again, but he's had enough, he moves quickly, catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from her. BURNETT You know what? You don't wanna believe me? That's fine with me! Go it alone. Burnett heads toward the open door.     Julie's veneer drops as she shrinks to the floor. (CONTINUED)

Like she was nothing. (trying to hold it together) Please shut the door. BURNETT You don't got any more golf clubs or bats, do you? Nothin' that you can swing at me, do you? She shakes her head.     He carefully steps forward. BURNETT Then lemme introduce myself. I'm Mike Lowrey. And I'm here to help you. JULIE You're not what I expected. BURNETT Yeah, well neither are you.      You swing like Barry Bonds. Burnett nods and crosses over to help Julie to her feet. BURNETT Alright. Look here, I need to know if you've called anybody. Or if you told anybody else where you are? JULIE No.   Nobody. 
BURNETT Good.     You got a back door? Julie nods, scoops up one of her dogs and grabbing another modeling bag off the table. JULIE Where are we going? (as she stuffs the dog into the tote) Duke! (CONTINUED)

I'll only deal with you. Otherwise, I'll take my chances. Burnett's getting a "not again" look on his face when -- KUH-BOOM! A SHOTGUN BLAST blows the front door open.       Clutching the bag, Julie races around the living room. 
BURNETT Let's go! JULIE Luke?!   Where's my other dog?! BURNETT Fuck the dog! Burnett sees the second dog cowering in the corner.       So he lunges over, scoops the dog up. CUT TO:

As the remaining parts are kicked in from the outside. It's Casper, Noah and Kuni! 
BURNETT AND JULIE Racing through the apartment toward the back door, Burnett wheels with the GUN and FIRES just as Kuni rounds a corner with the SHOTGUN. The room ERUPTS with plaster spray and NOISE. Julie shrieks, and Burnett shoves her through the back door, then spins and FIRES. Kuni tumbles and dies from multiple hits.

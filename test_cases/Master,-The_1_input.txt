INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
A young man, FREDDIE SUTTON (early 20s)_ speaks to a 
DOCTOR; 
DOCTOR What are you going to do when you get out of here? You're going to have to wear a belt for six months, maybe a year... 
FREDDIE What kind of belt? 
DOCTOR A surgical belt. You won't be able to do very heavy lifting. 
FREDDIE .I try to stay away from that. 
DOCTOR But you spend time outdoors. 
FREDDIE 
MMMM 
DOCTOR What do you do? 
FREDDIE 
DOCTOR You didn't have very much on you when you were admitted. Where were you going? 
FREDDIE I was on my way to Placerville. To the Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a friend of mine. He doesn't know where I am. 
DOCTOR How old are you, Freddie? 
FREDDIE 
DOCTOR Why don't you turn honest? You seem like an intelligent fellow. 'Quick on your feet - you like to drink? 
FREDDIE It's a weakness. But I like it. 
DOCTOR I know what the other is too. 
FREDDIE How can you tell that? I'm clean. 
DOCTOR The tattoo's. 
FREDDIE Is that a weakness... 
DOCTOR No one ever made money chasing girls. 
FREDDIE You're wrong. This tatoo's my Auntie. 
DOCTOR Who's that? 
FREDDIE My Auntie Bertha, (she raised me.) But that doesn't mean I don't have a weakness... 
DOCTOR College? 
FREDDIE I tried that, it didn't work. 
DOCTOR Why'd you leave? 
FREDDIE Sometimes my hypo's get the best of me, I really feel like walking into the street and hitting people's hats off. 
DOCTOR That's how you end up like this. With a burst appendix. 
FREDDIE That's when I know it's time to get to the sea.. what kind of belt? 
DOCTOR A medical belt. Similar for lifting. You're going to need some money. What do you plan to do? 
FREDDIE I'm going to pay back the hospital. And you. 
DOCTOR You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical duty. But you're expected to pay the hospital for medicines. And your belt. 
FREDDIE Alright. I intend to do that. You saying you have a job for me? What? As an orderly? 
DOCTOR You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have to learn. But maybe you could run an elevator, something of that sort. 
FREDDIE I want to get out of here, but I also like it here. You think I was gonna die? 
DOCTOR I know you were, Freddie. 
FREDDIE I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't save me... . but...I can't seem to die. 
DOCTOR Too lucky? 
FREDDIE Something like that.

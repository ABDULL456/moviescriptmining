CARRIE Good for you. 
RICK Yeah, but is it good for the kids? 
JOHN Do the kids have direction?

Rick stirs to reality. 
RICK I'm probably not as demanding of them as I should be.

The entire family sits eating dinner. Rick's Mother looks to Phillip. 
MOTHER So, Phillip what do you want to be when you grow up? 
Phillip studies Rick for a moment. Rick nods an approval. 
PHILLIP Daddy says I can do three things when I grow up. 
MOTHER And what are those? Phillip takes a deep breath. 
PHILLIP I can go to college and move the hell out of his house. I can join the military and move the hell out of his house, or I can get a job and... 
RICK ... move the hell out of my house. 
MOTHER Rick!

Rick shakes his head. 
RICK Ya gotta let them be what they're going to be. 
JOHN No, you have to mold them early. If you don't mold them they'll grow up to be Democrats. 
RICK And you do this with your kids? JOHN That's not the point, is it, Carrie? 
CARRIE I think Rick is doing a wonderful job. 
RICK It's a struggle, going at it alone, but... 
Carrie stands. 
CARRIE Excuse me, gentleman, I need to powder my nose. 
Carrie walks off. 
JOHN I can't believe you. 
RICK What? 
JOHN Whining about being single. Married men would kill to be in your situation! RICK I'm just saying it's hard. 
JOHN You have your sons to raise without feminine interference. Do you understand the significance of your situation? Do you understand the power in your circumstance?

INT: MOOKIE'S APARTMENT--DAY 
We hear a key in the door, the lock turns and Mookie enters. 
MOOKIE Jade. 
JADE (OS) I'm in here. 
INT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY 
Jade sits in a chair directly in front of an air conditioner going full blast. 
JADE How come you're not at Sal's? 
MOOKIE I'm working. 
JADE Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches? 
MOOKIE I just come home to take a quick shower. 
JADE Sal's gonna be mad. 
MOOKIE Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me. 
JADE I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work. 
MOOKIE Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me. 
JADE I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is. 
MOOKIE Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid. 
JADE Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities. 
MOOKIE What responsibilities? 
JADE I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about. 
INT: BATHROOM--DAY 
Mookie turns on the shower and screams; the water is ice cold. 
EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY 
Mother Sister sits in her window looking out at the block. 
EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--DAY 
Da Mayor has fallen asleep sitting on his stoop.  His hands loosely hold a brown paper bag that is tightly twisted around a beer can. 
EXT: CORNER--DAY 
Sweet Dick, ML, and Coconut Sid each hold an umbrella for protection from the hot and harsh rays. 
EXT: FIRE ESCAPE--DAY 
Ahmad, Punchy, Cee, and Ella sit on a fire escape, trying to keep still, trying to find a cool spot in the shade.  No one says a word. 
INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY 
Sal takes a seat at one of the tables. 
SAL I'm beat. 
Pino sits down next to his father. 
PINO Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive. 
SAL Since when do you know what's best for us? 
PINO Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood? 
SAL Too many pizzerias already there. 
PINO Then we could try something else.

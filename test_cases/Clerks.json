{"train": "\"CLERKS\" by Kevin Smith \n\"Clerks.\" \nby \nKevin Smith \nINT: BEDROOM. EARLY-MORNING HOURS \nA DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed. \nA CLOCK reads twenty to six. \nA SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno, Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his back to the camera, phone in hand. \nFIGURE (groggily) Hello...What?...No, I don't work today...I'm playing hockey at two. \nTHE DOG yawns and shakes its head. \nFIGURE (O.C.) Why don't you call Randal?... Because I'm fucking tired....I just closed last night.... (deep sigh) Jesus...What time are you going to come in?...Twelve...Be there be twelve?...Swear... \nA PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache. \nFIGURE (O.C.) Swear you'll be in by twelve and I'll do it....Twelve...Twelve or I walk. \nTHE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair and stands. \nTHE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it. \nDANTE Next time, I get the bed. \nHe releases the dog and sits up. \nDANTE (exhausted) Shit. \nCUT TO: \nINT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATER \nA steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from the toilet. \nCUT TO: \nINT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATER \nA towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATER \nChocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two scoops, three scoops, four scoops. \nCUT TO: \nINT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATER \nDANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet for some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor. THE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk. \nCUT TO: \nINT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATER \nDANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from atop a VCR. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATER \nA car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING \nThe car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open. \nCUT TO: \nDANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the store. \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING \nA very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot. Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls his eyes as it occurs to him. \nDANTE Shit. \nThe register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING \nPOV: NEWSPAPER MACHINE \nThe ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase. \nCUSTOMER What's this? \nACTIVIST It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man. \nCUSTOMER (drops ring) Unnhh! \nACTIVIST (picks up the ring) He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way. \nDANTE Excuse me, but... \nACTIVIST This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that? \nCUSTOMER Well, if it's already too late... \nACTIVIST It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead. (grabs nearby pack, reads) Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this. \nCUSTOMER It's not the same. \nACTIVIST It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this. \nHands him a picture. \nCUSTOMER Jesus! \nACTIVIST It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it. \nCUSTOMER (to DANTE) I'll just take the gum. \nDANTE Fifty-five. \nACTIVIST You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work. \nThe CUSTOMER exits. \nDANTE Maybe you should take that coffee outside. \nACTIVIST No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks. \nDANTE If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers. \nACTIVIST Okay. I'm sorry about that. \nAnother CUSTOMER comes up to the counter. \nCUSTOMER Pack of cigarettes. (looks at model) What's that? \nACTIVIST This? How long have you been smoking? \nCUT TO: \nEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nA blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB. \nJAY WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH! \nSILENT BOB lights a smoke. \nJAY I feel good today, Silent Bob. We're gonna make some money! And then you know what we're going to do? We're going to go to that party and get some pussy! I'm gonna fuck this bitch, that bitch... (Blue Velvet Hopper) I'LL FUCK ANYTHING THAT MOVES! \nSILENT BOB points to something off-screen. \nJAY (to O.C.) What you looking at?! I'll kick your fucking ass! (to SILENT BOB) Doesn't that motherfucker still owe me ten bucks? \nSILENT BOB nods. \nJAY Tonight, you and me are going off that fucker's head, and take out his fucking soul! Remind me if he tries to buy something from us, to cut it with leafs and twigs...or fucking shit in the motherfucker's bag! \nSome girls walk past. JAY smiles at them. \nJAY Wa sup sluts? (to SILENT BOB) Damn Silent Bob! You one rude motherfucker! But you're cute as hell. (slowly drops to knees) I wanna go down on you, and suckle you. (makes blow job neck-jerks) And then, I wanna line up three more guys, and make like a circus seal... \nJAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys, looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly. \nJAY Ewwww!  You fucking faggot! I fucking hate guys! (yelling) I LOVE WOMEN! (calmer) Neh. \nA GUY comes up to them. \nGUY You selling? \nJAY (all business) I got hits, hash, weed, and later on I'll have 'shrooms. We take cash, or stolen MasterCard and Visa. \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nA SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It has become something of a rally. \nACTIVIST You're spending what? Twenty, thirty dollars a week on cigarettes. \nLISTENER 1 Forty. \nLISTENER 2 Fifty-three. \nACTIVIST Fifty-three dollars. Would you pay someone that much money every week to kill you? Because that's what you're doing now, by paying for the so-called privilege to smoke! \nDANTE remains silent. \nVERONICA (sits beside him) Okay, champ. What's wrong? \nDANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look. \nVERONICA All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard? \nDANTE Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me! \nVERONICA At least they weren't lit. \nDANTE I hate this fucking place. \nVERONICA Then quit. You should be going to school anyway... \nDANTE Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point. \nVERONICA All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave. \nDANTE I'm not even supposed to be here today! \nVERONICA I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something. \nDANTE The guy got sick and couldn't come in. \nVERONICA Don't you have a hockey game at two? \nDANTE Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep! \nVERONICA Why did you agree to come in then? \nDANTE I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in. \nVERONICA Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here? \nDANTE Somebody jammed the locks with gum. \nVERONICA You're kidding. \nDANTE Bunch of savages in this town. \nVERONICA You look bushed. What time did you get to bed? \nDANTE I don't know-like two-thirty, three. \nVERONICA What were you doing up so late? \nDANTE (skirting) Hunhh? Nothing. \nVERONICA (persistent) What were you doing? \nDANTE Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now? \nVERONICA Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive? \nDANTE Who's defensive? Just...Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged. \nShe stares at him. \nDANTE What? What is that? \nVERONICA She called you, didn't she? \nDANTE Oh, be real! Would you...Would you please hug me? I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on. \nVERONICA stares at him. \nDANTE What? What's with that look?! I wasn't talking to anyone, especially her! Look at you, being all sort of...I don't know...stand-offish. \nVERONICA looks away. \nDANTE Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug me. I see how it is. All right Pissy-pants, you just go on being suspicious and quiet. I don't even want to hug you at this point. \nVERONICA looks back at him. \nDANTE (pleadingly) Give you a dollar? \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nA NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads: \nPLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHEN APPLICABLE. BE HONEST. \nDANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her chest. Change is heard hitting the counter. \nDANTE (to O.C. customer) Thanks. \nThe door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving. \nVERONICA How much money did you leave up there? \nDANTE Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning. \nVERONICA You're trusting. \nVERONICA I'm not the pig you are. \nDANTE Who? \nVERONICA You! \nDANTE No; who were the three, besides me? \nVERONICA John Franson and Rob Stanslyk. \nDANTE (with true admiration) Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of. \nVERONICA I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes. \nDANTE Animal, vegetable, or mineral. \nVERONICA Vegetable meaning paraplegic. \nDANTE They put up the least amount of struggle. \nVERONICA After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big. \nDANTE All right. Name it. \nVERONICA I want you to come with me on Monday. \nDANTE Where? \nVERONICA To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment. \nDANTE Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up? \nVERONICA It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school. \nDANTE Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this. \nVERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor. \nDANTE Shit! Why are we getting up? \nVERONICA Unlike you, I have a class in forty-five minutes. \nA handsome young man (WILLAM) is standing at the counter. VERONICA reacts to him. \nVERONICA (surprised) Willam! \nWILLAM Ronnie! How are you? You work here now? \nVERONICA (locks arms with DANTE) No, I'm just visiting my man. (to DANTE) Dante, this is Willam Black. (to WILLAM) This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend. \nDANTE How are you? Just the soda? \nWILLAM And a pack of cigarettes. (to VERONICA; paying) Are you still going to Seton Hall? \nVERONICA No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. (squeezes DANTE'S arm) \nWILLAM Do you still talk to Sylvan? \nVERONICA I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends. \nWILLAM (leaving) That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right? \nVERONICA I will. Take it easy. \nWILLAM Bye. (exits) \nVERONICA Bye (to DANTE) That was Snowball. \nDANTE Why do you call him that? \nVERONICA Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing. \nDANTE What do you mean? \nVERONICA After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing. \nDANTE He requested this? \nVERONICA He gets off on it. \nDANTE Sylvan can be talked into anything. \nVERONICA Why do you say that? \nDANTE Like you said-she snowballed him. \nVERONICA Sylvan? No; I snowballed him. \nDANTE Yeah, right. \nVERONICA I'm serious... \nA moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension. \nDANTE You sucked that guy's dick? \nVERONICA Yeah. How do you think I know he liked... \nDANTE Seven months. \nRANDAL Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin? \nDANTE Five years. \nRANDAL Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times? \nDANTE Eight and a half. \nRANDAL (looks up from paper) Eight and a half? \nDANTE Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me. \nRANDAL That's cheating? \nDANTE In the middle of it, she calls me Brad. \nRANDAL She called you Brad? \nDANTE She called me Brad. \nRANDAL That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl \"Mom.\" \nDANTE I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson. \nRANDAL What do you mean? \nDANTE She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party. \nRANDAL Oh, my God. \nDANTE Great story, isn't it? \nRANDAL That girl was vile to you. \nDANTE Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom? \nRANDAL Your mother. \nDANTE Allan Harris. \nRANDAL Chess team Allan Harris?! \nDANTE The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep. \nRANDAL That's frightening. \nDANTE It takes different strokes to move the world. \nRANDAL In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles. \nDANTE Because there was a lot of good in our relationship. \nRANDAL Oh yeah. \nDANTE I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity. \nRANDAL You think things would be any different now? \nDANTE They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone. \nRANDAL (suddenly recalling) Oh shit, I've got to place an order. \nDANTE I'm talking to myself here. \nRANDAL No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...? \nDANTE ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level. \nRANDAL What about Veronica? \nDANTE I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin. \nRANDAL Caitlin's on the same wave-length? \nDANTE I think it's safe to say yes. \nRANDAL Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over. \nDANTE All four? \nRANDAL You, Veronica, Caitlin... (lays paper flat) ...and Caitlin's fianc\u00e9. \nTHE HEADLINE of the engagement announcement reads, BREE TO WED ASIAN DESIGN MAJOR. \nCUT TO: \nINT: VIDEO STORE. DAY \nRANDAL dials the phone. He holds a list in his hand. \nRANDAL Yes, I'd like to place an order, please...Thank you. \nA MOTHER and her SMALL CHILD approach the counter. \nMOTHER Excuse me, but do you see videotapes? \nRANDAL All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with. (notices Dante's confusion) All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius. (MORE) \nRANDAL (CONT'D) You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living. \nThe BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them. \nBLUE-COLLAR MAN Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt, but what were you talking about? \nRANDAL The ending of Return of the Jedi. \nDANTE My friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels. \nBLUE-COLLAR MAN Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm a roofer... (digs into pocket and produces business card) Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements. And speaking as a roofer, I can say that a roofer's personal politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs. \nRANDAL Like when? \nBLUE-COLLAR MAN Three months ago I was offered a job up in the hills. A beautiful house with tons of property. It was a simple reshingling job, but I was told that if it was finished within a day, my price would be doubled. Then I realized whose house it was. \nDANTE Whose house was it? \nBLUE-COLLAR MAN Dominick Bambino's. \nRANDAL \"Babyface\" Bambino? The gangster? \nBLUE-COLLAR MAN The same. The money was right, but the risk was too big. I knew who he was, and based on that, I passed the job on to a friend of mine. \nDANTE Based on personal politics. \nBLUE-COLLAR MAN Right. And that week, the Foresci family put a hit on Babyface's house. My friend was shot and killed. He wasn't even finished shingling. \nRANDAL No way! \nBLUE-COLLAR MAN (paying for coffee) I'm alive because I knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client. My friend wasn't so lucky. (pauses to reflect) You know, any contractor willing to work on that Death Star knew the risks. If they were killed, it was their own fault. A roofer listens to this... (taps his heart) not his wallet. \nThe BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits. DANTE and RANDAL remain respectfully quiet for a moment. An angry WOMAN opens the door and pokes her head in. \nWOMAN Is that video store open or not? \nCUT TO: \nINT: VIDEO STORE. DAY \nRANDAL reads a newspaper. An INDECISIVE CUSTOMER studies the two rental choices she holds. She looks from one movie to the other repeatedly. \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER (attempting a solicit help) They say so much, but they never tell you if it's any good. \nRANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was even heard. She tries again, but this time with a different approach. \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER Are either of these any good? \nRANDAL continues to read. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER tries harder, then louder and more direct: \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER Sir! \nRANDAL continues to read. \nRANDAL (flatly) What. \nThe INDECISIVE CUSTOMER holds up her rental choices. \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER (politely) Are either of these any good? \nRANDAL, as always, reads on. \nRANDAL (again, flatly) I don't watch movies. \nThe INDECISIVE CUSTOMER is a tad flabbergasted, but not put off. \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER Well, have you heard anything about either of them? \nRANDAL does his level best to not get involved. \nRANDAL (reading) No. \nThe INDECISIVE CUSTOMER challenges him. \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER (in disbelief) You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie? \nRANDAL (O.C.) I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs. \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER (with a new determination) Well, how about these two movies? (holds up the same two) \nRANDAL continues to read his paper, not looking up. \nRANDAL They suck. \nThe INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his paper. She has caught him. \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention. \nRANDAL No, I wasn't. \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER I don't think your manager would appreciate... \nRANDAL (turning the page) I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am. \nINDECISIVE CUSTOMER I beg your pardon! \nSMOKER I was in the Food City last year when the same thing happened, different guy though. Stock boy told me that the guy had been looking through the eggs for like half an hour, doing all sorts of endurance tests and shit. I ask the kid how come nobody called the manager, and he says it happens twice a week, sometimes more. \nRANDAL Get out of here. \nSMOKER I kid you not. They call it Shell Shock. Only happens with guidance counselors for some reason. The kid said they used to make a big deal about it, but there's no point. \nThe ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor. He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg still sitting on the floor. \nSMOKER (O.C.) He said they always pay for whatever they break and they never bother anybody. \nDANTE, RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the O.C. man. \nDANTE Why guidance counselors? \nSMOKER If your job served as little purpose as theirs, wouldn't you lose it, too? \nRANDAL Come to think of it, my guidance counselor was kind of worthless. \nSMOKER (grabbing matches) See? It's important to have a job that makes a difference, boys. That's why I kill Chinamen for the railroad. \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nPOV RANDAL: THE EMPTY COUNTER \nAnd then a LITTLE GIRL comes into view, smiling and holding money. She can't be any more than five. \nLITTLE GIRL (innocently) Can I have a pack of cigarettes? \nRANDAL, without looking up from his magazine, completes the transaction. THE LITTLE GIRL puts a cigarette in her mouth. RANDAL hands her matches. DANTE returns to the counter as the girl skips away. Dante holds a price gun. \nDANTE Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie. \nRANDAL You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour? \nDANTE What's a jizz-mopper? \nRANDAL He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off. \nDANTE Nudie booth? \nRANDAL Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth? \nDANTE I guess not. \nA female CUSTOMER pops items onto the counter. DANTE rings her up. \nRANDAL Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks. \nDANTE What kind of show? \nRANDAL Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do. These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body...any opening. (to customer) He's led a very sheltered life. \nDANTE (indicating CUSTOMER) Can we talk about this later? \nRANDAL The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away. \nCUSTOMER (grabbing her bag, disgusted) This is the last time I come to this place. \nDANTE Excuse me? \nCUSTOMER Using filthy language in front of the customers...you should both get fired. \nDANTE We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away. \nCUSTOMER Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive. \nThe CUSTOMER stands silently, awaiting something. \nRANDAL Well, you think that's offensive... \nRANDAL flips open the magazine's centerfold-a graphic picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread wide open. \nRANDAL ...then check this out. I think you can see her kidneys. \nRANDAL checks out the centerfold wistfully. DANTE frantically apologizes to the rapidly exiting CUSTOMER. \nDANTE Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry! Please, wait a second, ma'am... \nThe CUSTOMER is gone. DANTE'S pursuit stops at the counter. DANTE turns on RANDAL. \nDANTE Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss. \nRANDAL Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers. \nDANTE I'm gonna hear it tomorrow. \nRANDAL You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer. \nDANTE What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them. \nRANDAL Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis. \nDANTE There aren't. \nRANDAL How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off? \nRANDAL (O.C.) (exaggeratively impressed) Thirty-seven! \nDANTE (to O.C.) Shut up! (to VERONICA) Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal. \nRANDAL makes loud slurping noises from O.C. \nDANTE (to O.C.) Why don't you go back to the video store? \nRANDAL walks past the two, and pats VERONICA on the head. He exits. \nVERONICA You had to tell him. \nDANTE I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective. \nVERONICA What did he say? \nDANTE At least he wasn't thirty-six. \nVERONICA And that made you feel better? \nDANTE And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen. \nVERONICA The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it... \nDANTE ...it isn't there. Yes. \nVERONICA Thank you for being rational. \nDANTE Thank you for the lasagne. \nVERONICA You couldn't get these shutters open? \nDANTE I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow. \nVERONICA Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class. \nDANTE What time do you get finished? \nVERONICA Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee? \nDANTE Sure. \nVERONICA Good. (kisses him) I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne. \nShe exits. DANTE leans against the magazine rack with his lasagne, contemplative. RANDAL pops his head in and makes the loud slurping noise again. \nCUT TO: \nINT: VIDEO STORE. DAY \nRANDAL is recommending titles to potential customers. \nRANDAL All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent. \nCUSTOMER (studying box) This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it. \nRANDAL Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right? \nDANTE opens the door and leans in. \nDANTE Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call. \nRANDAL (to DANTE) Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right? \nDANTE The best Burtless movie ever made. \nDANTE exits. RANDAL gives his customers the what-did-I-tell- you look. \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nTHE CAT lies on the counter. Pull back to reveal RANDAL as he rings up an order. The CUSTOMER pets the cat, smiling. \nCUSTOMER Awww, he's so cute. What's his name? \nRANDAL Lenin's Tomb. \nDolly over to DANTE, on the phone. \nDANTE Hello, is Mr. Synder there? This is Dante...Did he say if he was on his way here?...Here...The convenience store...I know, but the other guy called out this morning and Mr. (MORE) \nDANTE (CONT'D) Synder asked me to cover until he got here. He said he'd be here by noon, but it's one-thirty now, so I...Excuse me...Vermont?!...No, that can't be; I talked to him this morning...He left at what time?...He really went to Vermont?...When the hell was someone going to tell me?...He promised he was coming by noon!...Jesus...When does he get back?!...TUESDAY!...You've gotta be fucking kidding me!...I've got a hockey game at two, and the fucking shutters are jammed closed, and he's in Vermont?...I'm not even supposed to be here today!! (deep sigh) So I'm stuck here till closing?...This is just great...I just can't believe...I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you...No...No, I'll be all right...Well, that's all I can do, right?...Thanks. \nHe hangs up. RANDAL joins him. \nRANDAL Vermont? \nDANTE Can you believe this?! \nRANDAL He didn't mention it when he called you this morning? \nDANTE Not a fucking word! Slippery shit! \nRANDAL So, what-you're stuck here all day? \nDANTE FUCK! \nSANFORD Fine by me. But you're living in denial and suppressing rage. (skating away; to all) Dante said we can all drink free Gatorade. \nA laid-back hurrah is heard. \nRANDAL Are you gonna lock the store? \nDANTE I don't know. You going to lock the video store? \nRANDAL Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street? \nDANTE We're not playing in the street. \nRANDAL Then where're we gonna play? \nCUT TO: \nEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nThe sign on the door reads: \nTEMPORARILY CLOSED. BE OPEN AFTER FIRST PERIOD. \nThe PLAYERS ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one. ON THE ROOF they jump off the ladder and skate around. More players join them. \nFrom across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a store with many men gliding around on the roof. \nOn the roof DANTE skates and passes with another player. REDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. RANDAL pulls his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. SANFORD skates in and takes a shot, which RANDAL blocks. JAY and SILENT BOB deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge and JAY throws up a dime bag. DANTE holds a ball in the center of the court. \nDANTE Ready? \nPLAYERS take positions. SANFORD comes to the center and holds the ball in drop position. DANTE and REDDING face off, and the ball is in play. \nThe game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet. Faces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots are taken, CU's of various players included. \nINACTIVE PLAYERS call out encouragement and slander from the sidelines. More game playing including both goalies getting scored on and more face-offs. \nBelow, a CUSTOMER tugs on the convenience store door. He reads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting to peer over the ledge. Above, the game continues. \nBelow, the CUSTOMER shifts from one foot to the other impatiently. He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends. \nAbove, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of the customer peek. Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and he watches for a moment before calling out. \nCUSTOMER When's this period over? \nSOMEONE (O.C.) Eight more minutes! \nCUSTOMER Are you shitting me? I want to get cigarettes! \nDANTE skids to the sidelines. \nDANTE (out of breath) If you can just wait a few more minutes. \nCUSTOMER Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder! \nSOMEONE (O.C.) Dante! Where are you?! \nCUSTOMER He's busy! \nDANTE starts to skate away. \nDANTE I'll be right back. It's almost over. \nHe jumps back into the game. \nCUSTOMER What the fuck is this?! I want some service! \nDANTE (O.C.) In a second! \nCUSTOMER Fuck in a second! This is...Look at you! You can't even pass! \nDANTE (O.C.) I can pass! \nCUSTOMER How 'bout covering point!? You suck! \nDANTE skids back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER. \nDANTE Who are you to make assessments? \nCUSTOMER I'll assess all I want! \nSOMEONE (O.C.) DANTE! ARE YOU IN OR OUT! \nCUSTOMER (to O.C. SOMEONE) Don't pass to this guy! He sucks! (to DANTE) You suck! \nDANTE Like you're better! \nCUSTOMER I can whip your ass. \nBelow, a WOMAN pulls at the door. She peers into the store, face against the glass. \nDANTE (O.C.) That's easy to say from over here. \nCUSTOMER (O.C.) Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass. \nThe WOMAN backs up and, shielding her eyes, looks toward the roof. \nWOMAN Is the convenience store open? \nOLD MAN Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold. \nThe OLD MAN sifts through some papers and a few magazines. He comes back to the counter. \nDANTE You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there. \nOLD MAN Can I trouble you for one of those magazines? \nDANTE I said go ahead. \nOLD MAN No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter. \nDANTE glances over and reacts. \nDANTE The porno mags? \nOLD MAN Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties. \nDANTE (hands one to him) Here. Now leave me alone. \nOLD MAN Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one. \nDANTE makes the switch. \nOLD MAN Thanks son. I appreciate this. \nThe OLD MAN walks off. We hear the back door open and close, then the front door does the same. RANDAL joins DANTE. \nRANDAL Helluva game! \nDANTE One ball!! They come all the way here...I close the damn store...for one ball! \nRANDAL Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play. \nDANTE Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up! \nRANDAL Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? (walking away) \nDANTE Gatorade. \nPause. Then... \nRANDAL (O.C.) What happened to all the Gatorade? \nDANTE Exactly. They drank it all. \nRANDAL (O.C.) After an exhausting game like that I can believe it. \nDANTE (as RANDAL) \"It's not like we're gonna sell out.\" \nRANDAL comes back with drinks. \nRANDAL You know what Sanford told me? (offering drink) \nDANTE I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married. \nRANDAL Julie Dwyer died. \nDANTE Yeah, right. \nRANDAL No, I'm serious. \nDANTE is visibly taken aback. \nDANTE Oh, my god. \nRANDAL Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning. \nDANTE How? When? \nRANDAL Embolism in her brain. Yesterday. \nDANTE Jesus. \nRANDAL She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died midbackstroke. \nDANTE I haven't seen her in almost two years. \nRANDAL Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve? \nDANTE Number six. \nRANDAL You've had sex with a dead person. \nDANTE I'm gonna go to her wake. \nRANDAL No, you're not. \nDANTE Why not? \nRANDAL It's today. \nDANTE What!? \nRANDAL Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four. \nDANTE Shit. What about tomorrow? \nRANDAL Yeah, but at what a price. \nSilence. Then... \nDANTE I could never reach. \nRANDAL Reach what? \nDANTE You know. \nRANDAL What, your dick? \nDANTE Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later. \nRANDAL I never tried it. \nDANTE glares at RANDAL. Silence. Then... \nRANDAL Fucking pervert. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY \nDANTE and RANDAL walk up the path to the funeral parlor. \nDANTE I know it was a bad idea to close the store. \nRANDAL Listen to you. \nDANTE I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in. \nRANDAL Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday? \nCUT TO: \nEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nA MASSIVE CROWD is outside the store. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY \nDANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, closely chased by a small crowd of angry mourners. Car locks are slammed down. The car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the middle of the street, shaking their fists, throwing things. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT \nThe car pulls up and RANDAL and DANTE get out. Absolutely nobody is outside. \nDANTE (furious) I can't fucking believe you!! \nRANDAL I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault! \nDANTE You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes! \nRANDAL I was just leaning on it! It was an accident! \nDANTE Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose? \nRANDAL So the casket fell over! Big deal! \nDANTE Her fucking body fell out! \nRANDAL So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something! \nDANTE (opening door) Just...go! Go open the video store. \nJAY (O.C.) (mimicking) Yeah! Open the video store!! \nRANDAL (to O.C.) Shut the fuck up, junkie! \nJAY enters the frame, right next to RANDAL. He aims his butt at him and farts. RANDAL lunges for him. DANTE grabs RANDAL. \nDANTE (to RANDAL) Go open the video store. \nJAY Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk. \nDANTE (to JAY) How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store. \nJAY I'm not dealing. \nA KID tugs at JAY'S shirt. \nKID You got anything, man? \nJAY Yeah, what do you want? \nRANDAL heads to the video store. DANTE enters the convenience store and slides the sign to OPEN. After a few seconds, the IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (guy who lost his keys) appears, flashlight in hand, scanning the ground. \nIMPATIENT CUSTOMER (to JAY) Hey, did you see a set of keys lying around here somewhere? \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT \nDANTE I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even. \nCUSTOMER (considerably calmer; takes money) This is the last time I ever come here. (to RANDAL) And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open! \nThe CUSTOMER leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL salutes him. \nDANTE (angrily) What the fuck did you do that for? \nRANDAL Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines. \nDANTE Jesus! \nRANDAL And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior. \nDANTE What? \nRANDAL If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice. (extends opened palm) Agreed? \nDANTE (shakes his head; hands over keys) You're a danger to both the dead and the living. \nRANDAL I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny. \nDANTE Please, get the hell out of here. \nRANDAL I know I'm your hero. \nRANDAL exits. \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nDANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER). He lifts the gallon of milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt. \nTRAINER Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym. \nDANTE Excuse me? \nTRAINER I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds. \nDANTE I didn't strain. I sighed. \nTRAINER I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape. \nDANTE I don't think so. \nTRAINER Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized. \nDANTE They are not. \nTRAINER Yes, they are. You're out of shape. \nDANTE What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body. \nTRAINER No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise. \nA female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway. \nHEATHER Are you open? \nDANTE Yes. \nHEATHER (grabs a paper) Just the paper. \nDANTE (to HEATHER) Thirty-fire. \nTRAINER (to HEATHER) Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape? \nHEATHER (studies DANTE) I don't know. I can't really tell from here. \nTRAINER He is. \nDANTE I am not. \nTRAINER How much can you bench? \nDANTE I don't know. \nHEATHER (studying DANTE) I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops. \nDANTE I know I can bench more than that! \nTRAINER I think the lady called it. \nHEATHER My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy. \nTRAINER I do about three-fifty, four. \nHEATHER No way! \nTRAINER (rolling up sleeve) Feel that. \nHEATHER That's tight. Solid. \nTRAINER Now feel his. (to DANTE) Roll up your sleeve, chief. \nDANTE Oh for God's sake! \nHEATHER She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm. \nDANTE What? When? When did all this shit happen? \nTRAINER Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you. \nHEATHER I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class. \nDANTE Jesus Christ, what next? \nThe SUITED MAN rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and hands it to DANTE. \nSUITED MAN Here you go. \nDANTE What's this? \nSUITED MAN A fine, for five hundred dollars. \nDANTE WHAT? \nTRAINER Five hundred bucks? What for? \nSUITED MAN For violation of New Jersey Statute Section Two A, number one-seventy slash fifty-one: Any person who sells or makes available tobacco or tobacco-related products to persons under the age of eighteen is regarded as disorderly. \nDANTE What are you talking about? \nSUITED MAN According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor. \nDANTE I didn't do that! \nSUITED MAN You said you were here all day? \nDANTE Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! \nSUITED MAN An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours. It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child. \nDANTE But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid! \nTRAINER To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag! \nHEATHER That's sick, Dante. \nDANTE I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear! \nSUITED MAN The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day. \nThe SUITED MAN exits, with DANTE trying to follow. \nDANTE But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey! \nTRAINER (takes back the card) Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old. (to HEATHER) Can I offer you a ride somewhere? \nHEATHER Sure. How about the beach? \nTRAINER I like the way you think. \nThe two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons. He rubs his forehead. \nDANTE Jesus! What next? \nVOICE (O.C.) Dante? \nDANTE spins, angrily. \nDANTE What? \nHis expression softens. \nDANTE Caitlin? \nCUT TO: \nEXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT \nJAY deals with a customer as SILENT BOB looks on. \nJAY That's the price, my brother. \nJOHN Yo, I don't have that kind of cash. \nJAY For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash. \nJOHN How long you gonna be here? \nJAY Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party. \nJOHN You're gonna be at John K's party? \nJAY (to SILENT BOB) My man is deaf. (yelling) I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! (quieter) Neh. \nJOHN Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right? \nJAY The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning. \nJOHN Yo. I'll see you at that party. (puts his hand up to be slapped) I'll see you there? \nJAY (reluctantly slapping hands) I'll see you there. \nCAITLIN The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged. \nDANTE How like her. \nCAITLIN Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck. \nDANTE Thanks for the vote of confidence. \nCAITLIN Was I right? \nDANTE Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even. \nCAITLIN I love a macho fa\u00e7ade. It's such a turn-on. (sniffing air) What smells like shoe polish? \nDANTE And you came here to what? To comfort me? \nCAITLIN The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you. \nDANTE But you were. \nCAITLIN No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people. \nDANTE Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle-I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. \nCAITLIN I'm giving him his ring back. \nDANTE What? \nCAITLIN I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'' going to fit in all of the other stuff. I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway... \nDANTE Sang? His name is a past tense? \nCAITLIN Stop it. He's a nice guy. \nDANTE If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? \nCAITLIN I just told you. \nDANTE There's more, isn't there? \nCAITLIN Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? \nDANTE Tell me I don't have something to do with it. \nCAITLIN You don't have anything to do with it. \nDANTE You lie. \nCAITLIN Look how full of yourself you are. \nDANTE I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. \nCAITLIN If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major? \nDANTE Jesus, you're caustic. \nCAITLIN I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years. \nDANTE So who's asking? I don't want to marry you. \nCAITLIN Good. Stay in that frame of mind. \nDANTE Buy can we date? \nCAITLIN I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. \nDANTE We could introduce them. They might hit it off. \nCAITLIN You're serious. You want to date again. \nDANTE I would like to be your boyfriend, yes. \nCAITLIN It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it. \nDANTE Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market... \nCAITLIN You work in a market, all right. \nDANTE Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. \nCAITLIN The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date. \nDANTE So...what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating? \nCAITLIN I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens. \nDANTE Let me take you out tonight. \nCAITLIN You mean, on a date? \nDANTE Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie. \nCAITLIN The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before. \nDANTE You have a better suggestion? \nCAITLIN How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? \nRANDAL (to DANTE) You dog! I didn't see you go back there. \nDANTE is bewildered. \nCAITLIN And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so... (she lets out a growl and hugs DANTE) God! That was so great! \nDANTE (quietly) It wasn't me. \nCAITLIN (laughing it off) Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal? \nDANTE (to RANDAL) Was it you? \nRANDAL I was here the whole time. \nCAITLIN (half-laughing) You two better quit it. \nDANTE I'm serious. \nCAITLIN (beat) We didn't just have sex in the bathroom? \nDANTE No. \nEveryone is silent. Then... \nCAITLIN Stop this. This isn't funny. \nDANTE I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside. \nCAITLIN (covering her chest) This isn't fucking funny, Dante! \nDANTE I'm not fooling around! (to RANDAL) Who went back there? \nRANDAL Nobody! I swear! \nCAITLIN I feel nauseous. \nDANTE Are you sure somebody was back there? \nCAITLIN (hits DANTE) I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick! \nRANDAL You just fucked a total stranger? \nDANTE Shut the fuck up! \nCAITLIN I can't believe this! I feel faint... \nDANTE (to RANDAL) Call the police. \nRANDAL Why? \nCAITLIN No, don't! \nDANTE There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin! \nCAITLIN (weakly) Oh God... \nRANDAL She said she did all the work. \nDANTE WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP? (pause) WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM? \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. LATER \nTHE OLD MAN'S FACE is serene, almost happy, as he lies on a stretcher. (Same OLD MAN who took a porn mag to the bathroom.) \nCORONER (O.C.) Who is he? \nThe body bag zipper is pulled closed. DANTE, the CORONER, and RANDAL stand around the stretcher-bound body bag. The CORONER takes notes. \nDANTE I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom. \nCORONER What time was this? \nDANTE Um...I don't know. (to RANDAL) What time did hockey end? \nRANDAL Around three or something. \nDANTE What time did we go to the funeral? \nRANDAL I think four. \nCORONER Wait a second? Who was working here today? \nDANTE Just me. \nCORONER I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral. \nDANTE We did. \nCORONER Then who operated the store? \nDANTE Nobody. It was closed. \nCORONER With this guy locked in? \nDANTE Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there. \nDANTE I was born. \nRANDAL comes back. \nRANDAL You should shit or get off the pot. \nDANTE I should shit or get off the pot. \nRANDAL Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot. \nDANTE What are you talking about? \nRANDAL I'm talking about this thing you have...this inability to improve your situation in life. \nDANTE Fuck you. \nRANDAL It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is. \nDANTE What responsibility? \nRANDAL All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit. \nDANTE As if it's that easy. \nRANDAL It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you? \nDANTE Leave me alone. \nRANDAL You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself. \nDANTE Oh, like your life's any better? \nRANDAL I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day. \nDANTE Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store? \nRANDAL It's the same thing with Veronica. \nDANTE Leave her out of this. \nRANDAL You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two! \nDANTE Leave me alone. \nRANDAL If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward... \nDANTE ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward. (chuckles) It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do. \nRANDAL Am I right or what? \nDANTE You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin. \nRANDAL What? The dead guy? She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad. \nDANTE Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible. \nRANDAL Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement. \nDANTE What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change. \nRANDAL Make them change. \nDANTE I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes. \nRANDAL Who're you kidding? You can so. \nDANTE Jesus H. Christ, I can't! \nRANDAL So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change? \nDANTE (sadly) My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants. \nRANDAL Lovely story. \nDANTE Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably. \nDANTE crosses O.C. RANDAL appears contemplative. \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT \nDANTE repairs ripped dollar bills, taping them back together. JAY enters with SILENT BOB and claps his hands. \nJAY (singing) Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke! Drinking beers! (to DANTE) A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed! \nDANTE Done poisoning the youth for the day? \nJAY Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid. (pulls out money) E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs. \nDANTE One seventy-nine. \nJAY (to SILENT BOB) Pay the good man. (to DANTE) Don't you close soon? \nDANTE A half hour. \nJAY We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out. You get high? \nVERONICA stares, dumbfounded. \nVERONICA And...he told you all of this? \nRANDAL Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory. \nVERONICA I...I don't know what to say. \nRANDAL Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante. (beat) I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave. \nVERONICA I'm not sad. \nRANDAL You're not? \nVERONICA No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it! He has his friend do it for him! \nRANDAL He didn't ask me to... \nVERONICA After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut! \nRANDAL Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight? \nVERONICA (oblivious of RANDAL) I'm going to have a word with that asshole. \nVERONICA storms out. \nRANDAL Wait! Veronica...I don't think... \nRANDAL stares after her. A customer stands nearby. \nRANDAL (to customer) What am I worried about? He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests. I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor. \nCUSTOMER (sees box on counter) Oooh! Navy Seals! \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT \nDANTE is on the ground holding his knee. VERONICA stands above him. \nDANTE What the fuck did you do that for? \nVERONICA If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back! \nDANTE What're you talking about? \nVERONICA (kicks him) You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks! \nDANTE It was only a few times... \nVERONICA And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys! \nDANTE A couple...? \nVERONICA (throws purse at him) I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now! \nDANTE Would you let me explain... \nVERONICA Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her? \nDANTE (getting up) Veronica...I...it's not like that anymore...I mean, it was never really like that... \nVERONICA kicks him in the other leg. DANTE goes down, yelling in pain. \nVERONICA You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine! The slut is yours! \nDANTE I don't want Caitlin... \nVERONICA You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more? \nDANTE I don't want to go back with her... \nVERONICA Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again-and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for! (grabs her purse) I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't. \nDANTE (weakly) Randal...? \nVERONICA And having him tell me...that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless. \nDANTE Veronica, I love you... \nVERONICA Fuck you. \nVERONICA exits. DANTE lies on the floor alone. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: VIDEO STORE.

DAY \nA videocassette encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER glares at DANTE. Dante studies a copy of Paradise Lost, making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare. \nIMPATIENT CUSTOMER (pissed off) I thought that place was supposed to be opened at eleven o'clock? It's twenty after! \nDANTE I called his house twice already. He should be here soon. \nIMPATIENT CUSTOMER It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping. \nDANTE I'm sure he wasn't sleeping. \nIMPATIENT CUSTOMER You calling me a liar? \nDANTE No; he was probably just resting his eyes. \nIMPATIENT CUSTOMER What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller! \nDANTE Actually, that's his night job. \nIMPATIENT CUSTOMER Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work. (tosses tape on counter) I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch. You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too. \nDANTE If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you. \nIMPATIENT CUSTOMER (storming out) Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead. \nHe storms out. Dante lifts a ring of keys from the counter. \nDANTE (in a whisper) You forgot your keys. \nThe half-filled trash can swallows the ring of keys. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nAnother VIDEO-ANXIOUS CUSTOMER leans against the video store door. A hapless RANDAL drifts by and stops. He glances at the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug. \nV.A. CUSTOMER The guy ain't here yet. \nRANDAL You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty! \nV.A. CUSTOMER I know. I've been here since eleven. \nRANDAL (kicks the door) Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos! \nV.A. CUSTOMER I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall. \nRANDAL Which one? \nV.A. CUSTOMER Dental School. \nRANDAL You came for that too? That's the movie I came for. \nV.A. CUSTOMER I have first dibs. \nRANDAL Says who? \nV.A. CUSTOMER (suddenly snotty) Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs. \nRANDAL Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape. \nV.A. CUSTOMER Like hell you are! \nRANDAL I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape. \nV.A. CUSTOMER Twenty bucks? \nRANDAL Twenty bucks. \nV.A.

The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms up. \nIMPATIENT CUSTOMER You see a pair of keys lying around here somewhere? \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nRANDAL dances in, attempting a soft-shoe routine. He sees DANTE and stops dead, midshuffle. \nDANTE You're late. \nRANDAL What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one. \nDANTE The boss called. Arthur fell ill. \nRANDAL Why are the shutters closed? \nDANTE Someone jammed gum in the locks. \nRANDAL Bunch of savages in this town. \nDANTE That's what I said. \nRANDAL Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later. \n", "test1_true": "RANDAL What time do you have to stay till? \nDANTE He assured me that he'd be here by twelve. \nRANDAL What smells like shoe polish? \nDANTE Go open the sore. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE.

The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stares after him. \nIMPATIENT CUSTOMER Fucking kids. \nThe VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER now sits on the ground, next to the video store door. RANDAL balances his burden and shoves the key into the lock. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stares as RANDAL enters the store. The door closes behind him, only to be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later. RANDAL smiles. \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nA coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone heaps ground coffee on it. We've seen this same routine before. DANTE crosses back to his post, as RANDAL enters, tossing the key into the air happily and catching it. He picks the cat up. \nRANDAL Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday. I tore up his membership. \nDANTE Shocking abuse of authority. \nRANDAL I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule. (furtively) Is the Pelican flying? \nDANTE Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious. \nRANDAL I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back. \nRANDAL heads toward the walk-in door. \nCUT TO: \nINT: BACK ROOM. DAY \nPOV: VCR \nA far-away wall is the only thing we see, but mild gruntings give away an ascension of sorts. RANDAL'S head rises into view, as if he's climbing a ladder. He stops and looks into the lens. \nPOV: RANDAL \nThe PELICAN is a VCR that's hooked up to a surveillance camera. It records quickly. A hand reaches into the frame and shuts it off. \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nRANDAL pulls a soda from the cooler. \nRANDAL Want something to drink? I'm buying. \nDANTE (O.C.) No, thanks. \nRANDAL Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour. \nDANTE (O.C.) Why? \nRANDAL I wanted to use your car. \nHe walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at it. \nRANDAL Snake cake? \nDANTE sits in his seat behind the register. RANDAL grabs a paper and joins him behind the counter. \nDANTE You don't want to know. \nRANDAL You called Caitlin again? \nDANTE She called me. \nRANDAL Did you tell Veronica? \nDANTE One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks. \nRANDAL What do you two fight about? \nDANTE I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction. \nRANDAL (opening paper) I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree. \nDANTE You win. \nRANDAL I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past.

Caitlin really is getting married. \nRANDAL Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back. \nDANTE (exasperated) Empire. \nRANDAL Blasphemy. \nDANTE Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets. \nRANDAL There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today. \nRANDAL follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store. \nDANTE What's that? \nRANDAL All right, Vader's boss... \nDANTE The Emperor. \nRANDAL Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes? \nDANTE How do you mean? \nRANDAL Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one. \nDANTE I guess. \nRANDAL Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule. \nDANTE Yeah. \nRANDAL Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion. \nDANTE It would stand to reason, yes. \nRANDAL Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution. \nDANTE More or less. \nRANDAL The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief. \nDANTE I think they were Catholics. \nA BLUE-COLLAR MAN half enters the door. \nBLUE-COLLAR MAN Are you open? \nDANTE Yeah. Come in. \nHe goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe. \nRANDAL You know what else I noticed in Jedi? \nDANTE There's more? \nRANDAL So they build another Death Star, right? \nDANTE Yeah. \nRANDAL Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it. \nDANTE Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due. \nRANDAL And the second one was still being built when they blew it up. \nDANTE Compliments of Lando Calrissian. \nRANDAL Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right. \nDANTE And you figured it out? \nRANDAL Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army-storm troopers, dignitaries- the only people onboard were Imperials. \nDANTE Basically. \nRANDAL So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished. \nDANTE And the second time around...? \nRANDAL The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction. \nDANTE So? \nRANDAL A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers. \nDANTE Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at. \nRANDAL Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main? All they know is killing and white uniforms. \nDANTE All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction? \n", "test2_id": 2545, "test3_input": "DANTE Because I'm happy. \nRANDAL You're happy? \nDANTE I'm happy. \nRANDAL You're happy to get a fine? \nDANTE No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me. \nRANDAL Now I know you're lying. \nDANTE I'm not.

You've had quite an evening. \nDANTE She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out. \nRANDAL I feel so ineffectual.

Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later.

JAY carefully writes on a large piece of paper, using a thick marker. SILENT BOB hands him the scissors. JAY slowly cuts the large piece of paper. SILENT BOB hands him the tape. JAY snaps off a few pieces, and plasters the sign to the convenience store door. It is a large word balloon, and it reads I EAT COCK! Once in place, he raps on the window. RANDAL looks out, his face adjacent to the word balloon, making it appear as if he is saying he eats cock. The small group laughs hysterically. \nCUT TO: \nINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT \nCAITLIN enters, carrying an overnight bag. RANDAL is watching his porno. The porno is loud and lewd. CAITLIN stares. \nCAITLIN Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter. \nRANDAL Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree! \nCAITLIN You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in. \nRANDAL I take it she likes the guy. \nCAITLIN You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching? \nRANDAL Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore? \nCAITLIN She said not to come home until graduation. \nRANDAL Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante? \nCAITLIN What can I say? He does weird things to me. \nRANDAL Can I watch? \nCAITLIN You can hold me down. \nRANDAL Can I join in? \nCAITLIN You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite. \nRANDAL Few are.

And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store. \nCAITLIN Such a sordid state of affair. \nRANDAL And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on. \nCAITLIN I'll try to manage. \nShe heads toward the back. \nRANDAL Hey Caitlin... (cautionary) Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal. \nCAITLIN You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been. \nRANDAL Territoriality. He was mine first. \nCAITLIN (rubs his head) Awww. That was so cute. \nShe kisses his forehead and walks away.

Make a little bathroom bam-bam. \nDANTE I love your sexy talk. It's so...kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee. \nRANDAL Fuck you. \nThe cooler down is heard opening.

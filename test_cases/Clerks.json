That's great. That's something to be proud of. \nVERONICA I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes. \nDANTE Animal, vegetable, or mineral. \nVERONICA Vegetable meaning paraplegic. \nDANTE They put up the least amount of struggle. \nVERONICA After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big. \nDANTE All right. Name it. \nVERONICA I want you to come with me on Monday. \nDANTE Where? \nVERONICA To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment. \nDANTE Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up? \nVERONICA It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school. \nDANTE Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this. \nVERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor. \nDANTE Shit! Why are we getting up? \nVERONICA Unlike you, I have a class in forty-five minutes. \nA handsome young man (WILLAM) is standing at the counter. VERONICA reacts to him. \nVERONICA (surprised) Willam! \nWILLAM Ronnie! How are you? You work here now? \nVERONICA (locks arms with DANTE) No, I'm just visiting my man. (to DANTE) Dante, this is Willam Black. (to WILLAM) This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend. \nDANTE How are you? Just the soda? \nWILLAM And a pack of cigarettes. (to VERONICA; paying) Are you still going to Seton Hall? \nVERONICA No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. (squeezes DANTE'S arm) \nWILLAM Do you still talk to Sylvan? \nVERONICA I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends. \nWILLAM (leaving) That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right? \nVERONICA I will. Take it easy. \nWILLAM Bye. (exits) \nVERONICA Bye (to DANTE) That was Snowball. \nDANTE Why do you call him that? \nVERONICA Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing. \nDANTE What do you mean? \nVERONICA After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing. \nDANTE He requested this? \nVERONICA He gets off on it. \nDANTE Sylvan can be talked into anything. \nVERONICA Why do you say that? \nDANTE Like you said-she snowballed him. \nVERONICA Sylvan? No; I snowballed him. \nDANTE Yeah, right. \nVERONICA I'm serious... \nA moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension. \nDANTE You sucked that guy's dick? \nVERONICA Yeah. How do you think I know he liked... \n", "test1_true": "VERONICA That's because I never had sex with him! \nDANTE You sucked his dick! \nVERONICA We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around. \nDANTE (massive panic attack) Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys? \nVERONICA Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people. \nDANTE Oh my God-I feel so nauseous... \nVERONICA I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood. \nDANTE I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said. \nVERONICA Please calm down. \nDANTE How many? \nVERONICA Dante... \nDANTE How many dicks have you sucked?! \nVERONICA Let it go... \nDANTE HOW MANY? \nVERONICA All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked. \nDANTE This is different. This is important. How many?! \nShe counts silently, using fingers as marks. DANTE waits on a customer in the interim. VERONICA stops counting. \nDANTE Well...? \nVERONICA (half-mumbled) Something like thirty-six. \nDANTE WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX? \nVERONICA Lower your voice! \nDANTE What the hell is that anyway, \"something like thirty-six?\" Does that include me? \nVERONICA Um. Thirty-seven. \nDANTE I'M THIRTY-SEVEN? \nVERONICA (walking away) I'm going to class. \nDANTE Thirty-seven?! (to CUSTOMER) My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks! \nCUSTOMER In a row? \nDANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door. \nDANTE Hey! Where are you going?! \nVERONICA Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys! \nDANTE No, but you sucked enough dick! \nVERONICA Yeah, I went down on a few guys... \nDANTE A few? \nVERONICA ...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead! But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me! \nDANTE (a bit more rational) Well...why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?! \nVERONICA Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved. \nDANTE I feel sick. \nVERONICA (holds him) I love you. Don't feel sick. \nDANTE Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys. \nVERONICA violently lets go of him. \nVERONICA I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational. \nDANTE (pause) Thirty-seven. I just can't... \nVERONICA Goodbye, Dante. \nShe exits in a huff. DANTE stands there in silence for a moment. Then he swings the door open and yells out. \nDANTE Try not to suck any more dicks on your way through the parking lot! \nTwo men who were walking in the opposite direction outside double back and head in the direction. VERONICA went. \nDANTE HEY! HEY, YOU! GET BACK HERE! \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_id": 2544, "test2_input": "SANFORD Fine by me. But you're living in denial and suppressing rage. (skating away; to all) Dante said we can all drink free Gatorade. \nA laid-back hurrah is heard. \nRANDAL Are you gonna lock the store? \nDANTE I don't know. You going to lock the video store? \nRANDAL Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street? \nDANTE We're not playing in the street. \nRANDAL Then where're we gonna play? \nCUT TO: \nEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY \nThe sign on the door reads: \nTEMPORARILY CLOSED. BE OPEN AFTER FIRST PERIOD. \nThe PLAYERS ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one. ON THE ROOF they jump off the ladder and skate around. More players join them. \nFrom across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a store with many men gliding around on the roof. \nOn the roof DANTE skates and passes with another player. REDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. RANDAL pulls his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. SANFORD skates in and takes a shot, which RANDAL blocks. JAY and SILENT BOB deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge and JAY throws up a dime bag. DANTE holds a ball in the center of the court. \nDANTE Ready? \nPLAYERS take positions. SANFORD comes to the center and holds the ball in drop position. DANTE and REDDING face off, and the ball is in play. \nThe game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet. Faces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots are taken, CU's of various players included. \nINACTIVE PLAYERS call out encouragement and slander from the sidelines. More game playing including both goalies getting scored on and more face-offs. \nBelow, a CUSTOMER tugs on the convenience store door. He reads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting to peer over the ledge. Above, the game continues. \nBelow, the CUSTOMER shifts from one foot to the other impatiently. He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends. \nAbove, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of the customer peek. Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and he watches for a moment before calling out. \nCUSTOMER When's this period over? \nSOMEONE (O.C.) Eight more minutes! \nCUSTOMER Are you shitting me? I want to get cigarettes! \nDANTE skids to the sidelines. \nDANTE (out of breath) If you can just wait a few more minutes. \nCUSTOMER Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder! \nSOMEONE (O.C.) Dante! Where are you?! \nCUSTOMER He's busy! \nDANTE starts to skate away. \nDANTE I'll be right back. It's almost over. \nHe jumps back into the game. \nCUSTOMER What the fuck is this?! I want some service! \nDANTE (O.C.) In a second! \nCUSTOMER Fuck in a second! This is...Look at you! You can't even pass! \nDANTE (O.C.) I can pass! \nCUSTOMER How 'bout covering point!? You suck! \nDANTE skids back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER. \nDANTE Who are you to make assessments? \nCUSTOMER I'll assess all I want! \nSOMEONE (O.C.) DANTE! ARE YOU IN OR OUT! \nCUSTOMER (to O.C. SOMEONE) Don't pass to this guy! He sucks! (to DANTE) You suck! \nDANTE Like you're better! \nCUSTOMER I can whip your ass. \nBelow, a WOMAN pulls at the door. She peers into the store, face against the glass. \nDANTE (O.C.) That's easy to say from over here. \nCUSTOMER (O.C.) Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass. \nThe WOMAN backs up and, shielding her eyes, looks toward the roof. \nWOMAN Is the convenience store open? \n", "test2_true": "DANTE AND CUSTOMER (simultaneously) NO! \nDANTE (to CUSTOMER) There's a stick over there. You're shooting against the goal. (to the court) REDDING! COME OFF AND LET THIS FUCK ON! \nA new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER. The ball drops between the two and DANTE gets flattened. The CUSTOMER winds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the court, through the air, and into a faraway yard. DANTE calls to the sidelines. \nDANTE Give me another ball. \nSOMEONE (O.C.) There are no more. \nDANTE What the fuck are you talking about? How many balls did you bring? \nSANFORD skates up to him. \nSANFORD (counting) There was the orange ball...and the orange ball. \nDANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over. \nDANTE Are there any balls down there?! \nJAY (O.C.) 'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!! \nDANTE looks around, hyperventilating. \nDANTE You only brought one ball?! \nSANFORD I thought Redding had like three balls! \nREDDING (O.C.) I thought Dante had the balls. \nDANTE Nobody has another ball? \nSANFORD Shit! \nDANTE We get...what...twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!

DAY \nDANTE standing on a ladder, replaces a fluorescent light. An OLD MAN joins him at the foot of the ladder. \nOLD MAN Be careful. \nDANTE I'm trying. \nOLD MAN You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer. \nDANTE So I'm told. \nOLD MAN I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus. \nThe light in place, DANTE descends the ladder and closes it. \nDANTE And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...? \nOLD MAN No, he got hit by a bus. \nDANTE (confused) Oh...Can I help you? \nOLD MAN Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom? \nDANTE Um...yeah, but it's for employees only. \nOLD MAN I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of...you know...incontinent. \nDANTE Uh...sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler. \nOLD MAN Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there? \nDANTE The white kind. \nOLD MAN I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony? \nDANTE Actually, it is kind of rough. \nOLD MAN Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff. \nDANTE Yeah, but... \nOLD MAN Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough. \nDANTE Yeah, okay. Go ahead. \nOLD MAN Thanks son, you're a lifesaver. \nThe OLD MAN walks off. DANTE heads back to the counter. The OLD MAN returns. \nOLD MAN Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there...to read? It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on. \nDANTE Jesus...go ahead. \n", "test2_id": 2545, "test3_input": "DANTE I was born. \nRANDAL comes back. \nRANDAL You should shit or get off the pot. \nDANTE I should shit or get off the pot. \nRANDAL Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot. \nDANTE What are you talking about? \nRANDAL I'm talking about this thing you have...this inability to improve your situation in life. \nDANTE Fuck you. \nRANDAL It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is. \nDANTE What responsibility? \nRANDAL All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit. \nDANTE As if it's that easy. \nRANDAL It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you? \nDANTE Leave me alone. \nRANDAL You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself. \nDANTE Oh, like your life's any better? \nRANDAL I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day. \nDANTE Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store? \nRANDAL It's the same thing with Veronica. \nDANTE Leave her out of this. \nRANDAL You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two! \nDANTE Leave me alone. \nRANDAL If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward... \nDANTE ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward. (chuckles) It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do. \nRANDAL Am I right or what? \nDANTE You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin. \nRANDAL What? The dead guy? She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad. \nDANTE Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible. \nRANDAL Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement. \nDANTE What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change. \nRANDAL Make them change. \nDANTE I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes. \nRANDAL Who're you kidding? You can so. \nDANTE Jesus H. Christ, I can't! \nRANDAL So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change? \nDANTE (sadly) My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants. \nRANDAL Lovely story. \nDANTE Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably. \nDANTE crosses O.C.

It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed! \nDANTE Done poisoning the youth for the day? \nJAY Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.

You're more of a crook than I am, dude. \nDANTE How do you figure...HEY! You can't roll a joint in here! \nJAY (rolling a joint) Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit? \nDANTE It's not my store. \nJAY And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them. \nDANTE The difference is you exploit a weakness. \nJAY What's that mean? \nDANTE You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction. \nJAY All right. How much is Pepsi here? \nDANTE A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax. \nJAY At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax. \nDANTE So. \nJAY So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like \"A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there.\" That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it? \nDANTE I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here. \nJAY Hey, man, what happened with that old guy? \nDANTE He died in the bathroom. \nJAY That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off. \nDANTE I don't know. I wasn't watching. \nJAY Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her. (pantomimes sex) Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh? \nDANTE Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend. \nJAY You used to go out with her? \nDANTE We were going to start again, I think. \nJAY Don't you already have a girlfriend? \nDANTE Veronica. \nJAY Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food. \nDANTE Lasagne. \nJAY And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick? \nDANTE Maybe. \nJAY I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back...Didn't I see her change your tire one day? \nDANTE I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on. \nJAY Damn. She sure goes out of her way. \nDANTE She's my girlfriend. \nJAY I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit. (beat) Shit, my grandma used to say, \"Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it...\" No, wait. I fucked up. She said \"What's a good- looking plate with nothing on it?\" \nDANTE Meaning? \nJAY I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob. \nExit JAY. SILENT BOB stands there. \nSILENT BOB You know, there's a million fine- looking women in the world, but they don't all bring you lasagne at work. Most of them just cheat on you. \nSILENT BOB leaves. DANTE shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, as if in deep concentration. He suddenly snaps his eyes open. \nDANTE (nearly surprised) He's right.

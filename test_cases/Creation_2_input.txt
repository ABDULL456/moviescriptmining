FRANKY ....and he wouldn't let you leave unless you agreed to marry his fattest daughter. 
HOOKER Yes. (Conspiratorial) ....but you are never to tell my wife that! 
EMMA Children leave Mr Hooker alone now. I'm sure he has more important things to discuss. 
HOOKER Not really, but I think Mr Huxley does.... 
Huxley has seen Darwin, washing his hands by the "skeletonizing shed". 
Huxley hangs back to introduce himself as Hooker steers Emma off into the house. 
HOOKER I have my heart set on a cup of tea and one of Mrs Davies' scones. 
Emma looks anxiously after Huxley but allows herself to be gently side-lined. 
37   INT. KITCHEN. THE PRESENT. DAY .                             37 
Emma is by the kitchen window, rearranging tea things on a tray. 
The sky outside is dark and lowering. 
Through the window she can see Darwin heading off down the sand walk - head bowed, walking stick in hand - deep in conversation with Huxley. 
She drops a tea-cup which smashes on the stone floor. 
MRS DAVIES I'll do that ma'am. Please. Let me do it. 
38   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE SAND WALK. THE PRESENT. DAY.            38 
The Sand-walk is a gravel walking path between the garden and the fields, flanked by mature oaks and ancient willows. 
HUXLEY We're reforming the Linnean. The committee will comprise myself, Lyell, Huxley...yourself of course if you are willing. 
Darwin grunts noncommittally. The Crunch crunch of their feet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal-shod walking stick. 
HUXLEY We intend to reclaim science as a profession - wrest it away from the country parsons and beetle- collectors. Your book will be our rallying point. 
DARWIN. You know it is not yet any fit state to publish. 
HUXLEY I have read your detailed abstract. The argument is complete and utterly compelling. All that is lacking is the detail and we know you have that in abundance. Your barnacle work has established you as the pre- eminent authority on marine life. 
DARWIN. On one small mollusc! 
HOOKER In which the whole story of creation can be read. Do not pretend to me that was not your intention. 
DARWIN. Honestly.... 
HUXLEY A "family tree" of barnacles stretching back 300 million years to the time it was a free swimming prawn!. 
DARWIN. There are many gaps. 
HOOKER Of course with gaps! But that is the very point. If we but had the complete fossil record we could trace all life back to one speck of protoplasm. The branching of forms in ever more complex succession...until. 
DARWIN. Yes yes, but one cannot infer too much. 
HOOKER Mr Darwin. Either you are being disingenuous or you do not fully understand you own accomplishment. You have killed God. 
DARWIN. Mr Huxley 
HUXLEY ....and good riddance to the bearded malicious old bugger! 
DARWIN (interrupts) Please I must beg of you.... 
HUXLEY No. I must beg of you sir. Joseph Hooker we know is too nice a chap to do it. You are a fine and brilliant man who hates to give offence - an admirable quality - wish I had it myself. But what do we believe? What do we know to be true. Will you light the way or leave us all to flounder in the mire for another decade. 
He stops and lowers himself onto a bench, teeth clenched. 
HOOKER Are you alright? 
DARWIN. A touch of indigestion. It will pass. 
Its clearly worse than that, but Huxley, refusing to be distracted, blithely ignores it and sits down beside him til the worst of it passes.

The first raindrops hit the windshield. Edward turns on the wipers. 
INT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT - [THE STORM] 
Suddenly, a deluge descends. It's not even rain anymore -- there's no space between the drops. It's like being caught in a waterfall. It's that loud. 
No choice, Edward stops the car. Puts on the handbrake. Just as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but softly SPLASHING. The world is close and echoing, because -- 
EXT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT 
-- the car is underwater. The tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is water. 
Three catfish swim in front of his headlights. 
INT. THE CAR - NIGHT 
Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm. Water is trickling in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine. 
That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River. 
She's swimming outside the car. While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her. 
She puts her hand to the windshield. He puts his up to meet hers. And smiles. 
FLASH CUT TO: 
EXT. FIELD BY DIRT ROAD - DAY 
It's morning, and the sun shines brightly. Birds CHIRP. Trees drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain. 
Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from 
HIS CAR, 
which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. As Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny piece of metal sticking out of the dirt. He pulls it out, rubs it off. 
It's a key. It's the Key to the City he lost years ago. 
JENNY (V.O.) Fate has a way of circling back on a man, and taking him by surprise. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance. We pass a rusty sign... 
"Welcome to Spectre." 
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 
Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road, no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town's. 
JENNY (V.O.) A man sees things differently at different times in his life. This town didn't seem the same now that he was older. 
EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS 
We look around the town, on and off Main Street. There are "FOR SALE" signs in many of the windows 
JENNY (V.O.) A new road had brought the outside world to Spectre, and with it, banks, liens and debt. Almost everywhere you looked, people were bankrupt. 
EXT. SPECTRE - DAY 
We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among the bidders. 
JENNY (V.O.) Two different corporations were looking at buying the town, if they could get the price low enough. One wanted to open a chicken processing plant. The other, a municipal dump. Either way, Spectre would be destroyed. 
Edward raises his hand. 
EDWARD Fifty-thousand! 
Everyone turns to look at this new bidder. 
JENNY (V.O.) And so Edward Bloom decided to buy the town, in order to save it. 
INT. NORTHER WINSLOW'S MANHATTAN - DAY 
Edward pitches his plan to Norther. 
JENNY (V.O.) He was never a wealthy man, but he had made other men rich, and now he asked for their favors. 
INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY 
VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway. 
JENNY (V.O.) Most of them had never seen Spectre -- they only had Edward's words to describe it. That's all they needed. He sold them on the dream. 
JING You can structure it as a historical trust. But you'll need every contiguous piece of property. It's all or nothing. 
As Edward takes notes... 
JENNY (V.O.) So first he bought the farms. Then he bought the houses. Then he bought the stores. 
INT. AL'S COUNTRY - DAY

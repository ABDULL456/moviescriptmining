PEARL Sir, he wasn't gonna go. 
TAD Yeah, he was too afraid. 
NEMO No, I wasn't. 
MARLIN This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out there. You know you can't swim well. 
NEMO I can swim fine, dad, okay? 
MARLIN No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two. 
NEMO No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean-- 
MARLIN Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things but you just can't, Nemo! 
NEMO I hate you. 
MR. RAY There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a scientist, sir. Is there any problem? 
MARLIN I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little too soon for him to be out here unsupervised. 
MR. RAY Well, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me. 
MARLINLook, I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking-- 
FISH KID Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea! 
MARLIN Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me? Don't touch the bo--Nemo! 
TAD [whispering] He touched the butt. 
MARLIN You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big...big-- 
NEMO Aaaah! Daddy! Help me! 
MARLIN I'm coming, Nemo! 
KIDS Aaaah! 
MR. RAY Get under me, kids! 
NEMO Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy! 
MARLIN Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo! 
DIVER Whoa! Hold on. 
MARLIN Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no! 
MARLIN Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please! 
DORY Look out! 
MARLIN Waaaah! 
MARLIN Ooh, ooh... 
DORY Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay? 
MARLIN He's gone, he's gone.. 
DORY There, there. It's all right. 
MARLIN He's gone. 
DORY It'll be okay. 
MARLIN No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat. 
DORY Hey, I've seen a boat.

Kate looks at Harvey sympathetically for a moment. 
KATE Not bad. (beat) But what can I do for you? (beat) Make it worse, maybe? 
HARVEY Let me make it up to you. (beat) Would you let me buy you lunch. What time is it - tea time? I'll buy you tea. 
Kate blushes ever so slightly. 
KATE That's very sweet of you, but... I don't know you. And... you don't know me. 
HARVEY Exactly. That's why we should have lunch - tea. 
Kate can't help but smile. Beat. 
KATE Thank you, but...no. 
She indicates her book. 
HARVEY Because you've got your book. And it's a good replacement for humans. 
Kate smiles and nods. Just then her phone rings. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) If that's for me I'm in the shower. 
Kate smiles as she takes out her phone and looks at the incoming number. She is about to answer, when she stops herself. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Aren't you going to answer that? 
She thinks for a moment, before putting the phone back. 
KATE No. 
HARVEY Should I take that as a hopeful sign. 
Kate can't help but smile. 
KATE If it is, you could just give me a little wider smile. 
Kate can't help but smile wider. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Kate's mum pulls the phone away from her ear, perplexed by the lack of response. Her eyes wander to the window. Drawing back the curtain, she looks out. POV: The Neighbour, now sporting a white apron, busies himself as usual. He suddenly bends down and heaves what would best be described as a body bag onto his shoulder. As he stumbles under the weight, he carries it into the shed. Kate's mum turns away ashen. 
INT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY 
Harvey and Kate remain seated at adjacent tables. Muzak plays in the background. They are now virtually the sole patrons of Chez Gerard. Kate eats a salad and reads her book. Just then, Harvey's food arrives. Beat. 
HARVEY Look we are having lunch together. 
KATE (looks up and smiles) No. We're having lunch next to each other. 
HARVEY Ah. (beat/suddenly holds out his hand) I'm Harvey. Harvey Shine. 
KATE (takes it) Kate. Kate Walker. 
Kate can't help but smile at Harvey's persistence. Beat. She puts down her book. 
KATE (CONT'D) So why aren't you at the wedding? 
Harvey, momentarily taken aback by the directness of Kate's question, is about to answer, when the sound of a vacuum cleaner erupts. Harvey and Kate look over to see a cleaner vacuuming the floor nearby. 
HARVEY Ah, that's better. I knew something was missing. (shouting over the din) I had to get back for a work thing. 
KATE (over the din) A work thing. For the job you just lost? 
Beat. 
HARVEY (over din) Yes.

Ali and Don King hold court with the press. Also there is George Foreman and his trainer, Dick Sadler, and his manager, Nilon. 
DON KING (CONT'D) A historical happening. This event will show that the black man has arrived on the world stage. Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire. 
PRESS REACTIONS: 
where's Zaire? 
REPORTERS Don. Zaire? Why not Antarctica? What's wrong with New York City? 
DON KING Because you miss the significance. I dream, as Martin Luther King once dreamt, that a man could be judged by the content of his mind. This is about black men helping black men, overcoming four hundred years of racial depression to the dawn of a new day of liberation...financial and otherwise. 
King getting really evangelistic... 
DON KING (CONT'D) It will raise up the spirit of our inner cities. It will rise up and fill with hope the souls, the unrequited needs of the black proletariat, that is, the discouraged, dispirited, denigrated, denizens of the demimonde, that is called...the ghetto. 
Ali's looking at him in amazement. 
ALI Man, you crazy. 
Don King laughs. As the press digs King...MOVE ONTO Foreman, and here's what's wrong with all of this...we SEE that Foreman, eight years younger, two inches taller, almost as fast and seemingly twice as strong, is not beatable by Muhammad Ali. Foreman just doesn't hurt you, Foreman can kill you. How is Ali not going to get killed by this man 
with death in his eyes and indifference on his face? Meanwhile... 
DON KING Ten million dollars. With one stroke of the pen, you split the world's biggest emolumation of the history of sports! 
Ali signs a contract; then Foreman.       Flashbulbs. 
DON KING (CONT'D) The "Rumble in the Jungle"! 
Don King bursts out laughing. 
EXT. KINSHASA AIRPORT, TARMAC - ROOF - PAST HEADS - DAY 
PUSH THROUGH people and SEE an Air Zaire DC-10 pulling in. A ramp is wheeled up. The plane stops taxiing. Zairian officials in safari suits, paratroopers with white helmets, LT. NSAKALA and hundreds of African, European and American media with cameras and lights approach. The hatch opens. A ROAR emerges from the right and left. We don't see the source. 
INT. AIR ZAIRE DC-10'S - ALI 
Belinda's behind him. Bingham's there, Bundini, Angelo Dundee, Sarria. As they crowd to the door, we're shooting OVER ALI starting down the ramp. He looks up. We don't see what he sees. We see only the crowd of people at the foot of the ramp, including Don King in a dashiki and the crowd on the tarmac. 
FRONTAL:    ALI 
looking ABOVE the receiving party. The ROAR again. He looks side to side, almost distracted from King and the officials. He waves. Distant CROWD ROAR increases. They're chanting something. We don't understand the words. It contains his name. Now... 
PAST ALI:    REVEAL A THOUSAND PEOPLE 
are beyond the receiving party. They're on the roof of the airport. They're sitting on balconies and fences. They're waving their arms. They're on every possible horizontal surface that can support weight. They're shouting in unison, a syncopated ROAR...his name and something else. Ali moves through the receiving party, as if in a trance, to get through the airport to the other side. Security tries to keep up... 
EXT. AIRPORT ENTRANCE + STREET - ALI 
emerges and reacts. He's electrified. Dundee, Bingham, and a few cops are with him. Everybody else got left behind. REVEAL 10,000 people are OUTSIDE the airport, cheering his arrival. Their cheer is thunder. 
ALI (to Zairian Official; shouts) What are they saying, man?!!!    Why they saying that? 
ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1 They say, "Ali, boma ye. Ali, boma ye." ALI What's that mean?!   I don't understand! 
ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1 It mean...! 
ALI (can't hear) What?! 
ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1 (has to shout) It mean..."Ali, kill him! Ali, kill him!" 
Ali moves forward. The Zairian Official and four cops fade back, nervous about being in so large a crowd. The crowd's a tidal wave, carrying Ali forward, supporting, never mobbing him. MUHAMMAD ALI 
is overcome. This is all for him. He is their hero. He defied the world's powerful. They tried and could not destroy him. His defiance made him their champion. And now he has come to contest his rightful title against the numb instrument of the all-powerful. He raises his arm, too, and shouts... 
ALI Ali, boma ye! 
Ten thousand voices carry it on the wind and take away Ali's breath. 
ALI (CONT'D) Ali, boma ye! 
DON KING, ZAIRIAN OFFICIALS #1 + #2 
in the rear realize, as do we, this is NOT MERELY A BOXING MATCH. 
CUT TO:    INT. AIR ZAIRE DC-10 - NIGHT 
A towering man in denims with sequins blocks our view of the door as he walks out onto the ramp. Only now do we see BEYOND HIM a small welcoming party. Native African dancers, a big banner that proclaims, "Welcome, George Foreman," the Zairian paratroopers, media and a few dozen of the curious. 
FRONTAL:    GEORGE FOREMAN 
looks like "Superfly" on steroids. His entourage follows him down the ramp. DICK SADLER, tough and smart, is the Louis Armstrong of trainers. ARCHIE MOORE, crafty and wise, wears a blue shirt and blue pea-cap. 
If George Foreman wonders at the paucity of his reception, he doesn't let on. 
INT. ALI'S HOUSE, N'SELE - ALI - MORNING 
sits in EXTREME CLOSE-UP drinking coffee...lost in thought. He's somewhere else, puzzled, alone in his thoughts. He wears grey sweatpants, a thin-rubber long-sleeved T-shirt under his grey sweatshirt. He's oblivious to the Euro- modern furnishings. Then it's time, and he leaves... 
EXT. N'SELE COMPOUND - WIDE:    ALI

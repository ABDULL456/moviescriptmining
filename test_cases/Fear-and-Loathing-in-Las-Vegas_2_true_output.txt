GONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into DUKE. 
GONZO Look, you've got to stop this talk about snakes and leeches and lizards and that stuff.  It's making me sick! 
DUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS... 
On TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING DISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE. 
Newsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT CALLEY court-martial. 
DUKE What are you talking about? 
GONZO You bastard!  They'll never let us back in that place.  I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles!  You scared the shit out of those people!  They were ready to call the cops.  Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there... 
A knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat. 
DUKE Oh my God!  Who's that?! 
GONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to LACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares at a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep suspicion. 
LACERDA Duke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer. Got your press passes?  Good, good. Too bad you missed the bikes checking in.  My, what a sight! 
DUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS. 
Looking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the BOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers. 
DUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised, filthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him -- talking a foreign language. 
LACERDA Husquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis. Maicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs. Couple of Triumphs, here and there a CZ.  All very fast.  What a race it's gonna be. 
DUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is now just a keen photographer.L 
LACERDA Well, we start at dawn.  Get a good night's sleep.  I know I will. 
And with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock. 
DUKE (weakly) That's good... 
GONZO I think he's lying to us.  I could see it in his eyes. 
DUKE (even weaker) They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up. 
DUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV... 
GONZO Turn that shit off! 
GONZO kills the TV. 
Black screen. 
DUKE (V/O) Never lose sight of the primary responsibility.  Cover the story. But what was the story?  Nobody had bothered to say. 
EXT. DESERT - DAWN 
Against A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE SHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.  Clay pigeons shatter.  The Mint Gun Club. 
Next to them, MOTORCYCLES REV -- preparing for the MINT 400 RACE: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted MOTORSPORT TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights, topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening. 
DUKE wanders through. 
DUKE (V/O) The racers were ready at dawn. Very tense.  But the race didn't start until nine so we had three long hours to kill. 
A sign by a long trestle table: "KOFFEE & DONUTS." DUKE walks past -- ignoring the SMILING LADY behind the stall. 
DUKE (V/O CONT'D) Those of us who had been up all night were in no mood for coffee and donuts.  We wanted strong drink. We were, after all, the Absolute Cream of the National Sporting Press and we were gathered here, in Las Vegas, for a very special assignment.  And when it comes to things like this you don't fool around. 
INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY 
A real pit of iniquity.  Slot Machines.  Crap tables.  Smoke. Drunken shouting.  The absolute cream of the NATIONAL SPORTING PRESS. 
DUKE is at the bar, engaged in drunken conversation with a LIFE REPORTER...showing him his notebook.

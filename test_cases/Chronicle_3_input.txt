ANDREW (O.S.) Couldn't that metaphor just be for any muscle in the human body, like working out or- 
STEVE No, I like braingina.   Braingina is the shiiiiit. 
Steve floats up a bunch of chips from his bag, and then rapid fires them into his mouth. 
ANDREW (O.S.) I think it's time we took this out of the backyard. Matt and Steve look confused. 
INT. STEVE'S CAR 
Steve is driving, Matt's shotgun, Andrew's filming from the back. 
STEVE If anyone criticizes you, just call them a hater. It's like calling someone a racist, they'll just drop whatever they're complaining about and be like "I'M NOT A HATER." Nobody wants to be a hater. 
EXT. WAL-MART 
Matt and Steve are walking in, Andrew lagging behind filming. 
STEVE (CONT'D) Just stay back a little ways, yeah- 
ANDREW (O.S.) I got it. 
INT. WAL-MART 
The guys are trying to stay out of sight, looking down an aisle where shoppers stand. 
STEVE (O.S.) That girl, with the cart. 
A frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling on the cart. It suddenly breaks away from her, and goes careening down the aisle by itself, her chasing after it. We can hear the guys cracking up, trying to stay quiet. 
MATT (O.S.) She's chasing- she's chasing it- 
CUT. 
Toy aisle. A toddler is looking at teddy bears. 
ANDREW (O.S.) I got this. One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the little boy. The little boy is wowed. The teddy bear suddenly takes off and flies through the air. Again the stifled laughter. 
STEVE (O.S.) Oh my god Andrew, look- 
Andrew pans up to reveal a woman at the end of the aisle; she saw everything, and is looking around, wide eyed. 
CUT. 
They're by the check out. 
MATT (O.S.) See that guy chewing gum? 
ANDREW (O.S.) Umm... (camera finds the guy) Got him. 
MATT I'm gonna get the gum right out of his mouth- watch this. 
There's suddenly a little air ripple in front of the man's mouth, and he's yanked face first into the gum and candy rack, which all crashes apart. The guys all crack up and start running. 
STEVE (laughing) GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!? We don't need to run, we don't need to run! 
EXT. FIELD - SUNSET 
Matt sits on the hood of a car.   He and Andrew are flinging rocks with their powers. 
MATT That was a good one, you got that one far.

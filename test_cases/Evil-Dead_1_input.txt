SHELLY 
Oh my God, what suit? 
LINDA 
Diamonds, no wait! I mean hearts! 
SHELLY 
That's right- seven of hearts! 
LINDA 
Hey Ash, did you see that? I guessed two cards in a row. 
ASHLY 
(Still not paying attention) How do you do it Linda? 
He is concentrating on the tape. 
VOICE 
This is when I saw the dark figures moving about in the woods. I should have never tampered with the "Book Of The Dead." I now know that what- ever it is I have resurrected through this book, is coming for me. 
LINDA 
You know, I always thought I had some sort of extra sense. You know, like e.s.p or something. 
SHELLY 
What's this one? 
She holds up the queen of spades. 
LINDA 
Another seven! 
SHELLY 
I don't believe it! 
CHERYL 
(Still looking outside) Queen of spades.

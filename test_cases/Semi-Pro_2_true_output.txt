MS. QUINCY Have you ever been to an orgy? 
JACKIE MOON Pshh. Are you kidding? When haven't I been? 
INT. THE KREMLIN - AT A TABLE - MEANWHILE 
MONIX is hanging out with Bee Bee Ellis, Scootsie Double Day and Twiggy Munson. They all do a shot together. 
BEE BEE ELLIS I heard Jackie is going to go to some owner's meeting. What do you think that's about? 
MONIX I don't know, but it can't be good. 
TWIGGY MUNSON Hey, let's see that championship ring, Monix. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Yeah, you promised we could see the ice. Monix takes the ring out. It hangs from his neck. 
MONIX Look at this piece. It says Celtics right there in diamonds. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Why don't you wear it on your finger? 
MONIX I don't know, I just like to wear it around my neck, that's all. NOW CLARENCE chimes in without looking over... 
CLARENCE Not everyone sits around dreaming of playing in the NBA, you know. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Maybe not. But you do. 
TWIGGY MUNSON Yeah, that's all you ever talk about. 
MONIX You're not jealous, are you Clarence? 
CLARENCE No one calls me Clarence. 
BEE BEE ELLIS His name's Downtown. 
MONIX Okay Downtown. I'll make sure Downtown is only referred to as Downtown, okay Downtown? 
CLARENCE Don't think I don't know what you're doing. You're doing that thing where you pretend to mean what you say, but you don't. 
BEE BEE ELLIS Sarcasm. 
CLARENCE Yeah. How'd you like that sarcasm smacked off your face? 
MONIX Bring it, funky stuff. 
BEE BEE ELLIS That's sarcasm, man. He's doing it again! 
CLARENCE (to Bee Bee) I got this, alright? Monix squares off with a smile that says 'hit me.' Clarence takes off his leather full length and folds it nicely. 
CLARENCE (in Monix's face) How'd you like a knuckle sandwich? 
MONIX Knuckle sandwich? Who says that? 
CLARENCE I do motherfucker. I'm gonna pound you so hard, you're-- MONIX REARS HIS FIST BACK, about to release a strong Popeye 
HOOK-- 
CLARENCE 
WAIT! 
CLARENCE IMMEDIATELY SWITCHES GEARS, PUTTING HIS HANDS UP 
LIKE A SCARED LITTLE GIRL. 
CLARENCE (like a sissy) 
--WAIT! OKAY? COOL COOL COOL. CHILL 
OUT, MAN, ALRIGHT? WE'RE COOL-- 
BAM. MONIX PUNCHES CLARENCE IN THE STOMACH ANYWAY. 
BEE BEE ELLIS 
YESSS! I LIKE IT! IT'S OUR OWN

A beat. 
LAMBEAU The drinks at those things are free. 
Sean smiles. 
SEAN Hell, I know that. 
Both men laugh. 
LAMBEAU How about one now? 
SEAN Sounds good. 
They start to walk out. 
SEAN It's on you though, until eight o'clock tonight when I win my money.

LAMBEAU Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?

SEAN You're pretty quick with those numbers.  How about the odds of me buying the first round? 
LAMBEAU About thirty million to one.

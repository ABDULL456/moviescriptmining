IRENE (stunned) Jerome! 
Spying other Detectives some distance away in the parking lot. Jerome leads Irene out of a hidden side gate. 
IRENE What about the car? 
JEROME (grabbing her by the hand) Let's walk. 
IRENE Who are they? 
JEROME (holding his bruised knuckles) It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here. 
Jerome drags Irene across a vast, desolate lot, lit only by moonlight.  Feeling exposed, he breaks into a run. 
IRENE I can't. 
JEROME (anxious) Come on. 
IRENE My medication.  I left it back there. 
JEROME We'll get it later. (forcing her to look him in the eye) Irene, please. 
Irene realizes his seriousness.  She begins to run with him. The clearing is wider than Jerome anticipated.  They are only halfway across - extremely vulnerable if the Detective think yo look in their direction. 
INT.  MICHAEL'S.  NIGHT. 
The INVESTIGATOR is grilling MICHAEL, the club's owner.  The investigator suspiciously regards the multitude of mini-vacs in the kitchen and the incinerator burning the refuse. 
INVESTIGATOR (an accusing tone) You run a clean establishment. 
MICHAEL Are you a health inspector? 
INVESTIGATOR (showing Vincent's mugshot) Do you recognize this man? 
MICHAEL My eyes aren't so good. 
INVESTIGATOR I bet. 
Hugo calls out from the side door where he has discovered his fallen colleague. 
HUGO Sir. 
The Investigator hurries to him. 
INVESTIGATOR (to the still dazed Detective, examining his injuries) Did he hit you with his fist? 
DETECTIVE (head in his hands) More like a hammer. 
INVESTIGATOR (reprimanding the beaten Detective) Don't touch your face.  Don't swallow. Don't spit. (to Hugo) Quick, clean his teeth. 
Hugo uses a flashlight and a small dental-like implement to try to pick skin from Jerome's knuckles from between the Detective's teeth.  The Investigator finds the hidden side door. 
EXT.  DESOLATE LOT.  NIGHT. 
JEROME and IRENE continue to sprint across the enormous vacant lot in the moonlight, splashing through deposits of mud and water.  Just as the gate opens in the distance, Jerome hurls Irene into the safety of the undergrowth on the other side. Irene, out of breath, desperately feels for her pulse. 
IRENE (upset, a strangled protest) Are you trying to kill me?  Are you?! Don't you understand, I can't do that! 
Jerome tenderly removes Irene's hand from her pulse. 
JEROME You just did. 
Irene looks back across the vast clearing they have just negotiated, realizing what she has just done. 
From across the other side of the clearing comes an echoing cry from the center FIGURE.

97   INT. STAIRWELL                                                  97 ORDERLY Cynthia, take my hand. 
The Orderly rushes to her, but she wavers dizzily and FALLS down the half-flight. She's dazed, but she becomes alert when she sees the orderly approaching. She picks herself up and runs. 
98   INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR                                       98 She gets to the elevator. The door is just closing, but it opens again against a purse--Miriam's purse. The elevator is empty. Cynthia whips around looking for her. Orderlies and nurses are moving towards her. 
At the opposite and of the hallway, a window is broken. Cynthia runs to it. There is a WOMAN'S SCREAM from the street below. PEOPLE YELLING. Cynthia looks out and down. 
We know what she sees.    She covers her face. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
An orderly takes hold of her. She is docile now, almost weak. Alan runs up. He looks out the window. So does a Nurse. 
ALAN Jesus. 
The nurse crosses herself.    Cynthia is escorted away amid the confusion. 
99    EXT. SKY - DAY                                                           99 The CAMERA IS MOVING FORWARD, TOWARDS the window. 
It seemingly goes OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW. 
The FRAME is filled with bright blue sky. 
Silence, except for a slight BREEZE. 
Someone is falling through the sky.       It is MIRIAM. 
We see her CLOSER, flowing down, the wind rushing up round her. She is happy. 
MIRIAM Cynthia, it's really quite beautiful. 
The ground comes rushing up and we SLAM into it. 
BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
99A   INT. THERAPY ROOM - NIGHT                                               99A It's not a session.    It's a wake.   Cynthia sits, face half in shadow. 
CYNTHIA They want us all now. They want us with them. Whether we like it or not, we're going, 
ALAN Cynthia, we're all upset by what's happened. But let's not get-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA Harris promised us eternal bliss on the other side when we're all together. 
CONNIE Eternal bliss.... 
RALPH Eternal bullshit--! 
CYNTHIA Miriam was going to write a story about me. He killed her because she was going to help me got out of here. 
ALAN Cynthia, please... 
CYNTHIA You're not listening to me! He wants us all to die! He wants you all with them, and it's because of me! (sobbing) It's all because of me... 
Berrisford addresses a pack of about thirty REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS and CAMERAMEN. 
FIRST REPORTER Dr. Berrisford, what would you call two suicides on your promises so close together? 
BERRISFORD I'd call it a tragic coincidence. Unfortunately, Borderline Personality Disorder is indicative of a pre-existing disposition towards suicidal tendencies. 
SECOND REPORTER What about the commune girl? Has she confirmed that the fire was some sort of mass suicide? 
BERRISFORD As that is a police matter, I am not at liberty to comment on it. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
FIRST REPORTER Speaking of the police, doctor, isn't it true that they suspect that the recent deaths may not have been suicides at all? 
BERRISFORD That's completely absurd.   Where do you get this nonsense? 
FIRST REPORTER (a smug smile) From Lieutenant Wasserman. He confirmed to me that he's assigning some of his officers to the hospital grounds until further notice. 
Pandemonium as the other reporters seize this information.

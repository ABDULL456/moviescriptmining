Then a VOICE on the P.A. says: 
VOICE (filtered) Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie please pick up the white paging phone for a message? 
Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The announcement repeats itself again.  Then again. Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up and picks up the white paging phone. 
STORMIE (into phone) This is Stormie... 
Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking: 
MURDOCH Did you see a couple of girls go by here a moment ago? 
Stormie gestures to the elevators. 
STORMIE Just missed 'em. 
Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says: 
HOSPITAL OPERATOR (filtered) The message is from Erwin... he says to meet him at the side entrance in two minutes. 
Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the staircase. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 
Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck. He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan inside, climbing in after her and asking: 
STORMIE Where'd you get the truck? 
ERWIN Same place I've got Jason hid. 
STORMIE And where's that? 
ERWIN A place where no one ever goes. 
Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS out of the parking lot. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT 
The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather- worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE 
Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp, past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a short distance away from the pier and the three of them climb out. 
Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving platform tied up to the end. 
STORMIE What'd you do -- take him for a swim? 
ERWIN Almost. 
Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center, a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant. Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan, asks: 
ERWIN (continuing) Is she going to be alright? 
STORMIE I don't know. She's pretty fucked up. God, I don't know why I'm not... 
ERWIN You're a strong woman. 
STORMIE What's that supposed to mean? 
ERWIN Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean anything. 
Stormie gestures to the tarp. 
STORMIE Is this him? 
ERWIN Yeah... (whips back tarp) Meet the new and improved Jason. 
ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has done a good job of sewing Jason back together with barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch. 
STORMIE Why'd you put that stupid mask on him? 
ERWIN Take a look... 
Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask and quickly replaces it. 
STORMIE Good idea.

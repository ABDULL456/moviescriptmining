BRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a match.  She fires up the propane lantern. 
BRENDA (continuing) Looks like I turn in early. 
She moves the lamp and gets ready to climb into her bed.  She reaches down and takes the coverlet and tugs it clear, revealing something that has been left there. 
REACTION SHOT:  Fear spreads across her face. 
REVERSE POV:  WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  A camp hatchet lies across her pillow.  The shiny blade is marked with blood. 
BRENDA turns and runs from her room.

BRENDA runs through the rain, her flimsy pajamas drenched.  Her bare feet slip in the mud.  She heads for a small rise that leads to the softball field.

CUT TO: 
97    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - NIGHT 
The softball field is now lit.  BRENDA is confused.  She looks off behind the backstop.  Then to center field.  Confused, she runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind third base.  The CAMERA slowly zooms in on the darkness where BRENDA exited.  We hold on that spot for several seconds. Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream.  Then another. 
CUT TO: 
98    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
ALICE is at one of the windows. 
ALICE I don't here it anymore. 
BILL Can't hear anything through that wind and rain. 
ALICE It sounded like Brenda. 
BILL I'll go take a look. 
ALICE Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field? 
We are looking over at her shoulder.  The distant glimmer suddenly goes dark.  BILL joins her and looks. 
BILL Where? 
ALICE They're off now. 
BILL heads for the door. 
BILL I'll go check on Brenda.

She is stunned. She looks at Ted - and he just nods. 
MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D) He's not worth ten! Are you out of your mind? What about the rent? 
DAD He's a strong one, Rosie. Look at the way he holds his head! 
MRS. NARRACOTT How the hell are we gonna pull anything with that? Ted - you have to take him back. You have to take him back right now now. 
ALBERT No. 
MRS. NARRACOTT You have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back. 
Joey bridles at the raised voices but Albert takes the rope and tries to calm him. 
ALBERT No. No, please don't take him back. 
Suddenly we see Dad's dejection. He is a man lost. 
DAD We can't take him back till he's broken in. 
MRS. NARRACOTT And how are you gonna train a horse with that leg? ALBERT I'll train him. 
MRS. NARRACOTT No, you stay out of this, Albie. You don't know nothing about horses. 
ALBERT Please, Mum. Please let me. I can do it. 
DAD We have to keep him. We've no choice. 
MRS. NARRACOTT Right. Well... you've got one month to break him in or I'm taking him back myself. (She turns to the house, but then...) How did you get to thirty - what other fool bid you up that high? 
DAD It was Lyons. 
Mrs. Narracott turns back towards the house, then stops, dazed, speaking almost to herself. 
MRS. NARRACOTT We're gonna lose everything. After all we've been through - we're gonna lose it all. 
She turns back to the others - the weight of the mistake heavy on their shoulders - but Albert quickly steps forward. 
ALBIE Don't worry, Mum - I'll raise him - and I'll raise him good. 
MRS. NARRACOTT Well, you better. Go on - get started. See if a child can undo what your fool of a father's done to this family of ours. 
Mrs. Narracott storms into the house. Albert immediately goes to stroke Joey but the nervous horse draws back uncomfortably. Dad leads him off, drunk and bewildered, across the yard to the barn. 
EXT. STABLES. LATER. 
Albert loads some oats into a bucket and approaches Joey in the field. ALBERT Right. Let's make a start then. 
As Albert approaches, Joey nervously runs in circles, then stops on a dime, looking at Albert suspiciously. 
ALBERT (CONT'D) It's oats. Very tasty, that is. It's beef and gravy to us! 
Albert squats down. He shows the food. Joey catches the scent on the air, but still hesitates and shies away. 
ALBERT (CONT'D) Come on... 
This time, Albert takes a new tact, almost turning his body fully away from Joey, but keeping the bucket extended. Albert slowly backs towards Joey, speaking gently all the while. 
ALBERT (CONT'D) I bet you're missing your mother. Look at you... first time without your mum. First time away from home. But you're not alone, are you. In fact. Cos I'm `ere... 
Feeling safer, Joey moves toward the bucket of oats and starts to eat. 
ALBERT (CONT'D) It's alright. It's alright. 
Albert reaches out his hand and touches Joey. And with a slight start, the horse relaxes into Albert's hand, feeling safe with the boy. 
Albert stares at the distinctive white cross on Joey's forehead. Joey calms. 
ALBERT (CONT'D) I'm gonna call you Joey. Understand? Joey. That's you. And I'm Albert. It's alright, You're mine now. You're mine. 
Albert strokes Joey's forehead. Joey lifts his head and the two stare at each other in close proximity.

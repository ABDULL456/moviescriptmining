A line of limousines roll up to Dave's building and dozens of stone-faced EXECUTIVES from both companies file out... 
INT. LAW FIRM -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY 
KEN KINKABE and a slew of his EXECS sit on one side of the massive conference table. Sitting across from them are CEO TED NORTON, Mitch, Flemming Steel III, and a bevy of Amalgamated execs. No one speaks. It's a corporate staredown. Then the mediator, ERIN WALSH, 50's, enters, all business: 
ERIN WALSH Thank you all for coming. My name is Erin Walsh and I will be mediating your claim today... Mitch makes the "I'm gonna slit your fucking throat" gesture to Ken Kinkabe, who recoils, what the...: 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SIDE ROOM -- LATER 
The mediation has broken into two separate rooms. The Amalgamated team sits in their shirtsleeves, waiting in tense silence. PAPERS litter the table. They've been here a while. A large tray of sandwiches sits half-eaten on the sideboard. Mitch jams the last piece of a ham sandwich into his mouth, swallows it, and holds up his hands, victorious! 
MITCH 14! 14 sandwiches and 9 Diet Slice's! Pay up, cocksucker! An EXEC gives him a 5 dollar bill. Mitch waves it in the air and HUMS the Olympic theme song. Flemming just glares at him like, you're so fired. Then the mediator enters. 
ERIN WALSH Kinkabe agrees in principle to the terms of the sale, and valuates your company at 725 million dollars. This is their last and final offer. I'll be outside. She exits. CEO Ted Norton looks at Flemming, intense. 
FLEMMING STEEL III It's a fair deal. I don't think we'll get much more out of them... The other execs all nod. Then Mitch BURRRRPS: 
MITCH Fuck that, dude, you can do better. 
CEO TED NORTON I beg your pardon? 
FLEMMING STEEL III Shut your mouth, Lockwood--! 
MITCH Look, this is just like when you're trying to fuck a Jewish girl and she keeps saying "no, no, I don't want to, I'm really drunk and you're not circumcised" but then she keeps making out with you and not getting out of your Fiero so you know she really does want it, she just needs to be nudged a bit more so she can rationalize it to herself and to her God, know what I mean? This is just like that. Everyone in the room is speechless. Mitch opens another soda. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Jesus I do not feel good. 
FLEMMING STEEL III How is this...at all... like that? 
MITCH If this was really their final offer, they'd leave. Instead, they're sticking around, which means they have more money to spend. Ted looks at his execs. It's not a terrible point... 
CEO TED NORTON How much more do you think we can get out of them? 10 million? 15? 
MITCH Fuck it, homey, go for 100. 
CEO TED NORTON What?! 
FLEMMING STEEL III Do not listen to him, Ted, he is beyond reckless! If we make too large a counter-offer, we risk driving them away. 
MITCH Enh, can't hurt to ask. You wouldn't believe the nasty shit I get girls to do just by asking. Honestly, it's revolting. 
Ted looks genuinely torn. He dabs his sweaty brow. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Seriously, does anyone have a Pepto? Because I'm gonna throw. Finally, Ted opens the door and says to the mediator: 
CEO TED NORTON Tell Kinkabe we want an extra 100 million and that is our final offer, because we're leaving. (loudly, to his execs) Fuel the jet. Let's go. The mediator heads off as the execs start packing up their briefcases, bluffing. Mitch points at Ted. 
MITCH Nice, bro. Way to show some sack. 
CEO TED NORTON You had better be right, son, or else I am most definitely fired. 
MITCH Hey, me too. Bones. He extends his fist. Ted ignores him and gathers his things. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES -- A SHORT WHILE LATER 
Ted Norton and all his execs hurry out of the building, briefcases in hand, looking ashen. They head for their long line of idling limos. Ted hisses to Flemming: 
CEO TED NORTON I can't believe we just walked away from 725 million dollars. 
FLEMMING STEEL III For the record, I did not support 
THAT DECISION--: 
VOICE BEHIND THEM Mr. Norton?! Sir?! They turn to see the mediator jogging out of the building. 
ERIN WALSH Sir, Mr. Kinkabe has agreed to the 825 million. The deal is closed. 
A shocked CHEER rises up from the execs! Hugs and handshakes all around! Ted pumps Mitch's hand, ecstatic. 
CEO TED NORTON Helluva job! I owe you my life!

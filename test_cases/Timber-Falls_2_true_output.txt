The lights return to NORMAL.       The Young Man STOPS screaming. The place goes silent. 
The Young Woman's foot TOUCHES THE STEP...       A LOUD CREAK RINGS OUT. The Young Woman FREEZES. 
7    TORTURE ROOM #2--                                                    7 
The Concealed Figure TURNS towards the sound. 
8    HALLWAY, STAIRS--                                                    8 
The Young Woman holds her breath.       Did he hear her? 
9    TORTURE ROOM #2--                                                    9 
A STEEL AXE/SICKLE hybrid (a scary, handmade invention), rusted, save for the razor sharp edge, sticks in a nearby wooden horse. The Concealed Figure SNATCHES the weapon. 
YOUNG MAN SARAH!    RUN! 
10   HALLWAY, STAIRS--                                                10 
Sarah (Young Woman) bolts up the remaining steps. 
11   TORTURE ROOM #2--                                                11 
The Concealed Figure rushes for the door.      In pursuit. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
12   EXT.   FOREST - SUNSET                                           12 
SARAH races through the thick forest. Her bare, bloody feet and legs stomping over the hard dirt, branches, shrubs, anything in her way. Not too far behind... 
THE CONCEALED FIGURE... (the majority of him still hidden) follows her. WEAPON IN HAND. 
SARAH... pushes through some thick brush, but... trips, falls. She SCREAMS IN PAIN, grabs her foot, notices... A LARGE GASH ACROSS THE BOTTOM. Sarah turns, hears... 
THE CONCEALED FIGURE.. approaches in the distance. 
SARAH... wills herself up, limp/runs away. 
13   EXT.   FOREST - CLEARING/CLIFF - SUNSET                       13 
Sarah exits the thick woods to discover, to her horror... SHE STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A CLIFF, takes a peek over the side... 
SARAH'S POV - JAGGED ROCKS and a small STREAM at the bottom, 200 feet below. A WATERFALL flows steadily nearby. 
Before Sarah can fully digest the situation... 
THE CONCEALED FIGURE exits the forest, SPINS THE WEAPON in his hand. Anticipating its use. 
Sarah FREEZES in her spot. Breaths get shorter, heavier. Her eyes dart in every direction. What to do? 
The Concealed Figure TAKES ONE STEP FORWARD and... SARAH JUMPS OFF THE CLIFF. Rather that fate than the other. 
The Concealed Figure walks up to the edge, looks over... 
AT THE BOTTOM... Sarah's dead body lays twisted and bloody among the rocks. The waterfall crashes next to her. BLOOD mixes with the water turning it a deep RED. 
CUE TITLE: TIMBER FALLS... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
14   EXT.   HIGHWAY - WEST VIRGINIA - DAY (HELICOPTER 2ND UNIT)    14 
A black four-door VW Passat cruises the interstate.     A Gortex duffel is strapped to the roof. 
15   I/E.   PASSAT (MOVING) - DAY                                  15 
MIKE WARREN, late 20s, with a devilish grin and looks to kill, sits at the wheel. Even a flashy pair of sunglasses can't mask the twinkle in his eye. 
SHERYL JAMES, late 20s, rides shotgun. This beauty's got it all: toned bod, sharp mind and a heart-stopping smile. 
An opened bag of chips sit in her lap. A couple of Diet Cokes in the cup-holders. She cradles a cellphone MP3 player. 
MIKE Come on, hit me. 
SHERYL (Flipping through tunes) Chill...I gotta find -- alright. 
MIKE You got one? 
Sheryl hits the "Play" button. 
MIKE "Warning Shots", Thievery Corporation. 
Mike grins.   Sheryl rolls her eyes.

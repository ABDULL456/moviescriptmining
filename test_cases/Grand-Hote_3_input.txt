The Baron steps between the two looking straight into Preysing's face. 
DOCTOR Come, Mr. Kringelein. (he pulls him out of the scene towards the bar) 
PREYSING (his fists clenched, between his teeth) The man's insane -- he acts as if he is glad he is going to die... (hesitates -- to Flaemmchen) I shall see you in the lobby in half an hour.

FADE IN: 
KEY SHOT OF LOBBY OVER SENF'S HEAD 
General activity. 
The house detective, later identified, is talking to the chauffeur. He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf. 
HOUSE DETECTIVE Better let him stay -- I've sent for the Baron... How's your wife coming along? 
SENF I was at the hospital all night walking up and down the corridor. They wouldn't let me in to see her. She has the pains, but the child doesn't come and I have to stay here chained to this desk. 
HOUSE DETECTIVE It will be all right. 
SENF I hope so. 
At that moment Preysing enters. 
PREYSING Did you send that page? 
SENF The young lady's there, sir. 
Preysing glances off to see Flaemmchen standing looking around. 
Preysing crosses to Flaemmchen. 
FLAEMMCHEN Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing? 
PREYSING Sit here. (calls to a boy) Cognac -- for you? 
FLAEMMCHEN Nothing. 
At that moment the Baron and Kringelein pass. 
Preysing glances up at Kringelein as he passes. 
PREYSING I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel. 
FLAEMMCHEN Well -- you want me? 
PREYSING (looks straight at her) Yes. 
FLAEMMCHEN Well? 
PREYSING I must go to England -- at once. 
FLAEMMCHEN Well? 
PREYSING You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean -- 
FLAEMMCHEN I understand perfectly. 
PREYSING What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip? 
FLAEMMCHEN Wait -- I must figure it up. (she smokes and thinks) First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice? 
PREYSING Of course -- of course. (he is fidgeting) 
FLAEMMCHEN A thousand marks -- (she waits anxiously thinking it might be too much) 
PREYSING It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you. 
She is looking away. 
PREYSING I can get a room here in the Grand Hotel for you. 
She still looks away. 
PREYSING Can you pay some attention to me? 
FLAEMMCHEN Oh, yes. 
PREYSING (looking off) Insolent young cub! 
FLAEMMCHEN You mean Baron von Gaigern? 
PREYSING Baron! 
FLAEMMCHEN Well, he's a gentleman!

{"train": "MAXIMUS (to his men) Hold steady... steady... \nHe can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment continuing -- fire pots and Scorpion bolts and flaming arrows -- panic in the German encampment. \nMAXIMUS Steady... \nHe sees the Germans begin fleeing across the plain.  He quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns to his men: \nMAXIMUS Brothers -- I salute you!  For Rome! \nHe spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the plain... \nEXT.  PLAIN - BATTLEGROUND - TWILIGHT \nMaximus leads the terrifying and relentless cavalry charge -- Titus at his side -- the Felix Regiment screams out fearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain toward the Germans -- \nFire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere around them -- \nThe cavalry SLAMS into the Germans at full gallop -- \nIt is carnage. \nThe Felix Regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short swords -- slicing a path of sheer destruction through the Germans -- but the Germans fight with equal brutality -- and the Germans also fight with the desperation of a hopeless last chance -- they pull and spear Roman soldiers off horses whenever they can -- \nMaximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert efficiency -- a spear stabs through the neck of his horse and it immediately collapses forward -- \nMaximus sails over the horse's head and crashes to the muddy ground -- he jumps up and is in the midst of the battle -- \nThe flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a ferocious inferno everywhere around the battle -- the flames silhouetting the fighting -- \nOn the ground, Maximus proves his absolute worth as a warrior -- he hacks and dodges -- ghastly images of true ancient warfare -- Maximus' eyes burn with a zealous fire as he fights for his life -- \nHe finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage -- Germans are surrounding him from all sides -- as he fights he looks for an advantage -- for his soldiers -- for anything -- he is doomed -- \nThen -- an almost mystical image -- Maximus' wolf leaps through a wall of flame -- \n\"The Wolf of Rome\" savages several Germans around Maximus -- giving him the help he needed. \nThe wolf and his master fight, side-by-side. \nEXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT \nWe see an old man's face, staring down at the battle.  The face is weather-beaten, ailing.  The roaring flames from the battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes. \nMARCUS AURELIUS, the Emperor of Rome, is on a horse.  A metal brace extends from the back of his saddle.  He is strapped to the brace with thick, leather straps. \nHe watches as the Felix Regiment below concludes the battle.  The cheering of the Regiment can be heard as the final, isolated pockets of Germans are cut down. \nBehind Marcus the sun is setting, painting the world blood red. \nEXT.  BATTLEFIELD - SUNSET \nMaximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of the carnage.  The Wolf of Rome is at his side.  Dead and dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere.  Roman surgeons are attending to the wounded. \nMarcus walks to him, embraces him warmly. \nMAXIMUS Caesar. \nMARCUS Maximus, you prove your valor again. Let us hope for the final time here. \nMAXIMUS I don't think there's anyone left to fight. \nMARCUS There are always people left to fight... \nMarcus takes Maximus' arm and they walk through the masses of bodies.  Maximus holds Marcus' arm firmly, quietly supporting him as they walk. \nMARCUS But this night, at least, Germania is at last defeated... What will you do now, my friend? \nMAXIMUS Should Caesar permit, I'll go home. I've been away too long.  I've forgotten my wife's face and I barely know my son. \nSuddenly, a tethered GERMAN PRISONER they are passing calls out to them: \nGERMAN PRISONER THIS BLOOD MEANS NOTHING, CONQUEROR! \nMaximus and Marcus stop.  A soldier moves quickly to silence the German Prisoner. \nMARCUS (to Soldier) Stop... (to Prisoner) ... You speak our language? \nGERMAN PRISONER You have been in my homeland for twelve years.  Of course I speak your language.  So did my son, who you murdered.  So did my daughter, who you raped. \nMAXIMUS (to Marcus) Come, Caesar... \nMARCUS No.  Let him speak... (to Prisoner) ... I am Rome, what would you say to me? \nGERMAN PRISONER (points to sunset) You are that sun, Rome, and your time is over... You can slit a thousand throats here, and you can put a thousand babies to the sword, but it will always be our home. \nHe turns and stalks away. \nEXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT \nWe see the Roman encampment, a sea of tents.  Hundreds of campfires burn before the tents. \nINT.  HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT \nMaximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of the dead and dying.  Roman surgeons are working feverishly to save lives.  Limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps quickly cauterized with hot irons.  Leeches and bronze cups are employed for blood-letting to balance \"humours.\" \nAnesthesia as we know it is nonexistent.  Wine amphoras are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward the patients.  Mostly, though, they just hold down the writhing patients. \nMaximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort here and there.  All the wounded are delighted to see him. \nHe goes to an older soldier, GALLUS, who has one wooden hand.  His other hand is bandaged. \nMAXIMUS What, Gallus, losing your other hand? \nGALLUS Aye, General, they're going to make a bronze one for it.  Long fingers this time. \nMAXIMUS And the women of your village will crave your touch even more. \nGALLUS Ah, then you know the women of my village. \nMaximus smiles and moves on. \nHe stops at a young soldier, VALERIUS, whose head has been shaved.  A hole has been bored into his skull to relieve the pressure on his brain.  The young soldier is dying. \nMAXIMUS What's your name, son? \nVALERIUS Valerius, General. \nMAXIMUS The name suits you. \nVALERIUS Why am I dying? \nA beat.  Maximus sits by his cot.  He takes Valerius' hand. \nMAXIMUS You're dying because you love Rome, as I do. \nVALERIUS I've never been to Rome. \nMAXIMUS Neither have I.  Rome for us lives here... (he touches his heart) ... it's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children. \nVALERIUS It must be glorious, Rome.  I've only seen pictures.  Is it a glorious place? \nA beat. \nMAXIMUS Yes, it's a glorious place. \nVALERIUS It must be. \nHe smiles.  And he is dead. \nMaximus sits for a moment.  He gently closes Valerius' eyes.  And Maximus finds that he is weeping. \nHe is not ashamed of the tears. \nINT.  MESS TENT - NIGHT \nAn immediate swirl of noise.  The grand mess tent is crowded with soldiers.  They are still filthy with caked- on mud and blood.  Wounds are bandaged and tankards are raised in celebration of the victory. \nMarcus sits in a central position and receives visitors. Currently two Senators, FALCO and GAIUS, are bowing before him. \nFALCO Hail, Marcus Aurelius. \nMARCUS Stand up, Senators.  That unfamiliar posture doesn't suit you. \nGAIUS We live in supplication to your glory. \nMARCUS All the while conspiring with that fat man in Rome.  How is the old monster? \nGAIUS Senator Gracchus is hale, sire. \nMARCUS Still damning me to the four winds? \nGAIUS Still eager for your triumphant return to Rome, Caesar. \nMARCUS I would have silenced him decades ago -- but I just like him too much. \nMeanwhile, Maximus stands with his lieutenants, Titus and Quintus.  A wound on Maximus' arm has been bound. \nMAXIMUS (to Titus) If you want to stay on, I support you.  So do the men.  I'll ask the Emperor to appoint you in my place. \nTITUS It won't be the Felix Regiment without you. \nShe turns to him.  He leaves his body slaves and goes to her. \nLUCILLA Father. \nMARCUS What a Caesar you would have made. \nLUCILLA You're right. \nMARCUS I think you would have been strong. I wonder if you would have been just? \nLUCILLA I would have been what you taught me to be. \nA beat.  They stare at each other.  He finally smiles. \nMARCUS Well, pretend to be my loving daughter tonight and walk with me to my chamber. \nShe smiles and takes his arm.  They slowly walk down the tent corridor as: \nMARCUS This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it? \nThey disappear into darkness. \nEXT.  TENT CITY - DAWN \nMaximus is slogging through the mud and snow that blankets the Rome camp.  He stops to observe an unusual sight. \nCommodus is stripped almost naked, his chiseled body covered in a fine sheen of sweat.  He and his six CENTURION BODY GUARDS are going through their daily ritual.  They defy the sub-zero temperatures and hack at small trees with swords. \nIt is an eerie, zen-like workout.  Commodus' intense concentration is unnerving. \nMaximus watches for a moment then moves on.  He approaches a large network of tents.  He enters. \nINT.  MARCUS' TENT - DAY \nMaximus enters Marcus' darkened tent.  Flickering braziers provide the only light in the enormous Imperial tent. Heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind. \nMarcus stands before a map of the Roman Empire. \nMAXIMUS (bows) Caesar. \nMarcus holds out a scroll. \nMARCUS Read this. \nMAXIMUS I never acquired the art, sir. \nMARCUS Of course.  No matter.  In this letter I denote my intention to nominate you to stand for the Emperorship after my death. \nA stunned pause.  Maximus stares at him. \nMARCUS My son is not a moral man.  You have known this since you were young.  He cannot rule. \nMAXIMUS Caesar, I am honored but -- \nMARCUS For twenty years I have been spilling blood.  For twenty years I have written philosophy and ruminated and conquered.  Since I became Caesar I have only had four years without war.  Four years of peace in twenty.  So perhaps I can be... forgiven. \nA long beat. \nMARCUS While I have been fighting, Rome has grown mad and corpulent and diseased.  I did this.  And now I shall make it right. \nMAXIMUS Sire, you brought the light of the Gods to barbarian darkness.  You brought civilization and justice to the farthest -- \nMARCUS (fierce) I have brought the sword -- nothing more!  Rome is far away and we shouldn't be here.  What matter is it to the Gods if we subdue one more tribe of Parthians or Gauls?  What matter is it to Rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash? \nA beat. \nMarcus sits.  He doesn't look at Maximus. \nA pause. \nMARCUS Winter, Maximus.  It's winter now... \nA beat. \nMARCUS There was a dream that was Rome.  I can only whisper of it now. Anything more than a whisper and the dream vanishes.  It's so... fragile. The true glory of Rome is in a very fragile idea.  Imagine a place devoted to the rights of the citizen.  Where every free man has a voice.  That was the dream... And I fear it will not survive the winter. \nHe holds out a hand to Maximus.  Maximus takes his hand, deeply moved, kneeling. \nMARCUS Let's just whisper here, you and I. \nMAXIMUS Yes, Caesar. \nMARCUS If the dream is ever to live again the people must have a true voice. The voice I took from them.  That all the Caesars took from them, bit by bit, conquest by conquest.  And now that I am dying I am going to give them that voice again. \nMAXIMUS You're not dying. \nShe smiles sadly. \nLUCILLA There was a time when you didn't call me \"Highness.\" \nMAXIMUS And there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea.  All that was a different life. \nLUCILLA (quietly) Very different... I wonder if it was better? \nMAXIMUS It was more honest. \nA moment between them.  We sense there is much to be said, much that could be said. \nFinally: \nMAXIMUS I thank you for your prayers. \nHe goes.  She watches him walk away. \nINT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT \nMaximus kneels before a small altar in his tent.  He faces six small figures that represent his dead ancestors. \nMAXIMUS Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you for your guidance.  Bring me your solace and your wisdom.  Blessed Mother, come to me in my dreams with the Gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword.  Keep them safe until my return.  Whisper to them in their sleep that I live only to hold them again and all else is dust and air.  Ancestors, true bloodline, I honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. \nHe looks at his \"ancestors\" for a moment and then blows out the candles around them. \nINT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT \nCommodus' eyes are red with weeping.  He sits, head down, at the foot of Marcus' bed and speaks to his father. \nCOMMODUS (quietly) I search the faces of the Gods for ways to please you... to make you proud... and I can never do it.  One kind word -- one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight -- would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years... What is it in me you hate so much?  My eyes are your eyes.  My hands are your hands.  All I have ever wanted was to live up to you. Caesar.  Father. \nHe stands.  We see that he is holding the scroll denoting Marcus' intention to nominate Maximus as Emperor to the Senate.  Commodus cannot control his tears. \nCOMMODUS Why does Maximus deserve what I could never have? -- Why do you love his eyes over mine? -- I would butcher the whole world -- if you would only love me... \nCommodus weeps. \nINT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT \nQuintus is waking Maximus -- \nQUINTUS General -- Maximus -- \nMAXIMUS Quintus -- ? \nQUINTUS The Emperor needs you.  It's urgent. \nMaximus leaps up and throws on a cloak, strides out with Quintus... \nEXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT \nDead of night.  Maximus and Quintus stride quickly through the sleeping camp toward Marcus' tent. \nMAXIMUS What is it?  Is he ill? \nQUINTUS I don't know... \nThey continue on toward Marcus' tent. \nINT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT \nMaximus and Quintus stride into the tent -- Maximus slams to a halt.  Stunned. \nCommodus stands before him.  Lucilla stands in a corner of the tent, head down. \nAnd Marcus Aurelius dead, lying on his bed. \nMaximus stares at Marcus. \nCOMMODUS Lament with me, brother, our great father is dead.  I want -- \nMaximus, not even hearing, steps past him to Marcus. \nHe stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before Marcus and gently kisses the old man's forehead.  A ritual farewell. \nA moment of silent mourning and then Maximus stands.  He turns very, very slowly to Commodus. \nCOMMODUS General, the Gods' have taken the great man and left me alone.  My first desire as Emperor is that you take my hand in friendship.  I need you at my side, Maximus, at this moment above all others.  Stand with me. \nMaximus glares at him: \nMAXIMUS How did he die? \nCommodus does not respond. \nASSASSIN #3 Not like this, exactly... this is good, you can stop. \nThey stop.  They are far down the hill, out of sight of the road. \nMAXIMUS It can be very messy -- you could get blood all over your armor.  You don't want to hack me up now.  You want one clean stroke. \nASSASSIN #3 Would you kneel, General? \nMaximus kneels, his whole body secretly coiling.  Assassin #3 stands over him as: \nMAXIMUS One good stroke -- you do know where, don't you? \nASSASSIN #4 Be quiet. \nMAXIMUS If you miss the spot there'll be blood everywhere.  Quite a spray. \nASSASSINS #3 All right, where? \nMAXIMUS Here -- you don't want to hit the vein on the neck -- \nMaximus points his bound hands at a spot on the back of his neck. \nMAXIMUS Put the point of your sword here... you want one, good blow right at this spot -- \nAssassin #3 dutifully puts the point of his sword on the spot on Maximus' neck. \nA grave mistake. \nMaximus instantly grabs the blade of the sword with his hands and yanks it from Assassin #3 -- EXPLODING up -- his hands are bleeding but he tosses the sword into the air and catches it -- swings the sword with brutal efficiency -- decapitating both assassins -- \nEXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN \nOn the road above, the other two Assassins are on their horses, waiting. \nThey hear a quick yelp from below.  And then nothing. \nAssassin #1 nods for Assassin #2 to check on the execution.  Assassin #2 canters off the road and down the hill... \nEXT.  FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN \nAssassin #2 canters down the hillside. \nHe senses movement behind him -- spins around, drawing his sword -- too late -- \nMaximus throws a sword -- it flashes through the air -- and into Assassin #2. \nEXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN \nAssassin #1 waits on his horse.  He hears the commotion below -- spins his horse around just as Maximus bursts to the road.  He stands with a sword. \nAssassin #1 spurs his horse and gallops toward Maximus at full speed -- Maximus crouches and prepares -- \nAssassin #1 and Maximus swirl together for an instant -- both slashing brutally -- \nAssassin #1 continues to gallop past Maximus.  He stops. He looks down.  A wound in his stomach.  He falls off his horse.  Dead. \nMaximus has also been wounded -- a deep gash on his side. He fights the pain as he moves toward the horses... \nEXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAY \nMaximus is galloping through the forest at lightning speed, leading four horses behind him.  The gash in his side bleeding. \nEXT.  TENT CITY - DAY \nA gloomy day.  Emperor Commodus stands before the assembled Felix Regiment. \nThe soldiers are already uneasy.  They note Quintus standing by Commodus, wearing Maximus' seal of office. Where is Maximus? \nCOMMODUS Even as the Gods curse this dark day with clouds, so too does the sun begin to shine forth on a promised tomorrow.  Even as we mourn the passing of our father, so too do we celebrate the coming of a bright, new age for Rome.  At my side, brothers, you shall pull fresh glories from the heavens.  At my side, brothers, you shall know the adoration of the Gods.  Doubly-dark is this day because my friend, your noble commander Maximus Meridas, has been called to Rome to deal with urgent matters of state... \nTitus glances quickly to Gallus, whose hand is bandaged from surgery.  They know this cannot be true. \nCOMMODUS Until his promised return I appointed Quintus Domitian to serve in his stead.  I salute you, Legionnaires! \nQUINTUS (raising his sword) Hail, Caesar! \nThe Felix Regiment responds, many unsure. \nFELIX REGIMENT Hail, Caesar! \nCommodus strides off and the Felix Regiment slowly disbands, muttering to one another in confusion. \nTitus and Gallus go to Quintus. \nTITUS Quintus, what is -- ? \nJUBA For your wound... \nMaximus stares at him. \nJUBA (nods) For your wound. \nMaximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side. \nJuba carefully places his poultice over the wound -- Maximus hisses in pain -- Juba massages the poultice into the wound gently as: \nJUBA If you die in the wagons they feed you to the lions... The lions are worth more than we are.  I think we are worth more than the zebras though.  So they don't feed us to them. \nMaximus stares at him.  Juba looks down at him with the barest hint of a smile. \nJUBA I'm not sure about the giraffe. \nEXT.  SLAVE MARKET - DAY \nThe heat of Morocco is unlike anything Maximus has ever known.  Shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand. \nThe provincial market is bustling like the proverbial anthill.  Slave traders and dealers and merchants move around, all talking very quickly and very emphatically. \nMaximus, Juba and a number of other slaves are on display, poked and prodded and fondled.  Their BEDOUIN SLAVE TRADER sings out their praises to any passers. \nThe crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival of PROXIMO.  Proximo is a large man of immense appetites. He has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate.  Two slaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with switches. \nSLAVE TRADER Proximo, my old friend, see what I have for you today -- ! \nProximo SLAMS a fist into the Slave Trader's face.  The Slave Trader sails back. \nPROXIMO Those giraffes you sold me won't mate!  All they do is run around not mating!  YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH GIRAFFES!! \nThe Slave Trader pulls himself up, hugely obsequious. \nSLAVE TRADER I will make it up to you, Master. It's bargain day for you!  Look, look, look -- I have two lions and a panther -- hear how they roar for you!  \"Bring me home, Proximo!\" \nProximo examines the animals. \nPROXIMO How much for the lot? \nSLAVE TRADER For you -- 8,000 sesterces. \nPROXIMO For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want to see their balls first.  And you throw in those two slaves. \nSLAVE TRADER (moves to Maximus) What about this one?  Look at the arms! \nProximo moves to Maximus.  The Slave Trader forces open Maximus' mouth. \nPROXIMO Good teeth -- \nProximo notes the many old battle scars on Maximus' body. \nPROXIMO Where did you get those scars? \nMaximus doesn't respond. \nPROXIMO Are you a soldier? \nMaximus doesn't respond. \nPROXIMO Do you speak? -- (he roars back to a slave) KEEP THOSE DAMN FLIES OFF ME! (back to Maximus) He's dying. \nSLAVE TRADER 1,000 sesterces. \nPROXIMO My ass... (moves to Juba) You throw in this one and we'll make it 7,000 sesterces for the whole lot. \nSLAVE TRADER I have to eat, Master!  He's my finest, I couldn't let him go as part of the lot for less than 9,000 total... (back to Maximus) I tell you this one is prime.  He's a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my men before he could be subdued! \nProximo looks at Maximus, notes the many battle scars again.  The scars, and something he senses in Maximus' eyes, is enough for Proximo to consider it. \nPROXIMO (to trader) All right, let's see. \nThe Slave Trader and his colleagues grab Maximus and bustle him across the market, unlocking his chains. Maximus has no idea what's going on. \nIn the center of the market place, a veritable GIANT of a man sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand.  He is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot chain shackled to his ankle.  A think metal helmet is riveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair emerging.  His dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in the helmet. \nThe Slave Trader puts a wooden sword in Maximus' hand and shoves him toward the Giant.  The Giant stands.  He towers over Maximus. \nThe Giant suddenly swings his sword -- he moves with remarkable quickness -- Maximus makes no attempt to block the blow -- it sends him flying to the ground. \nMaximus pulls himself up. \nThe Giant moves in and hits him again -- Maximus recoils -- the Giant hits him again -- Maximus falls. \nMaximus pulls himself up. \nJUBA I almost killed once.  The Romans destroyed my village.  I was with a hunting party and when we returned... I would have killed every Roman in the world. \nA long beat. \nJUBA If you don't eat you will die. \nMaximus does not respond. \nA beat. \nJUBA In the village I come from there was a man once.  He went fishing one day and his boat was attacked by crocodiles.  One of them ate his leg.  He pulled himself to the shore and a lion attacked him.  It ate one of his arms.  He dragged himself through the desert on the way home and a scorpion stung his eye.  So he only had one eye.  When he reached the village I sat with him.  I said, \"You have lost a leg, an arm and one eye.  You must have a mighty will to live.\"  He said, \"No, Lord, it's just better than the alternative.\" \nMaximus finally looks at him. \nJUBA Life is a gift from our fathers to us.  Who are you to give it up for lack of lifting a spoon? \nMaximus does not respond. \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - NIGHT \nMaximus and Juba are being observed.  Proximo stands in the shadows of the compound and watches intently. \nEXT.  SLAVE WAGON - PROVINCIAL STREETS - DAY \nBlood appears to be flowing across an oxen's back.  But the blood is too rich, too red. \nThe oxen are pulling an open slave wagon through the crowded streets of the town.  Hanging above the street is dyed wool drying in the sun.  Vermilion and crimson dyes drip down and splash across the oxen -- and splash across the gladiators. \nMaximus, Juba, the formidable Vibius are chained in the back of the wagon.  Also the frightened Scribe. \nProximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon.  Proximo has an umbrella over him, colored with years of dripping dyes. \nThey pass a banner honoring Vibius, the star of Proximo's stable. \nMeanwhile, the terrified Scribe is almost weeping, chattering nervously to Vibius, chained next to him: \nSCRIBE I know nothing of armaments and warfare!  I'm a scribe -- I write down words!  I can write down seven languages -- \nVIBIUS Be still. \nSCRIBE I don't -- how do you hold the sword?!  I've never held a sword! \nVIBIUS You point the sharp end at your opponent and you shove it in his guts. \nSCRIBE I can't -- I -- \nHe suddenly vomits. \nVIBIUS (calling to Proximo) Proximo!  You insult me with this carrion!  Chain him to someone else! \nPROXIMO (calling back) Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't be bothering you for long. \nThe Scribe begins to weep. \nThe crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators. Occasionally throwing trash at them.  A pack of children run alongside the wagon, chanting: \nCHILDREN Dead guts!  Dead guts!  Dead guts! \nMaximus watches the children for a moment and then another sight draws his attention.  Over some buildings he can see vultures circling in the distance. \nEXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DUGOUT - DAY \nIn the cramped holding area of the arena, a dugout beneath the stands, Maximus and the other gladiators are waiting. \nProximo walks before them, giving a final \"pep talk.\"  He gazes at them evenly, his eyes going from face to face. \nPROXIMO Some of you say you can't fight, you won't fight... They all say that... But one day you will pick up a sword and thrust it into another man.  And the crowd will cheer you and love you.  And you will love them for it. On that day... you will be a gladiator. \nHe stops at Maximus. \nPROXIMO In this life, we all die.  All we can choose is how we die.  And how we are remembered.  Be remembered proudly. \nDrums are heard from the arena.  Proximo nods to a waiting blacksmith. \nThe blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiator's wrists -- chaining them together in teams of two by a chain about four feet long. \nThe blacksmith is about to chain Maximus to the Scribe. \nPROXIMO No... (he points to Juba) ... give the Spaniard to him.  Give the Scribe to Vibius. \nProximo nods to Vibius, who, for reasons we shall soon see, makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering Scribe. \nProximo watches the blacksmith shackle Maximus and Juba together and then strides off. \nJUBA (to Maximus) Are we going to fight each other? \nCHILD We honor Caesar with the laurel to show our love and appreciation for his benevolence. \nCOMMODUS Caesar is honored to accept your tribute, Citizen Scholar. \nThe child smiles and moves back to his fellows. \nCOMMODUS (to all) It is the most sacred duty of the Emperor to oversee the education of the young.  If I could leave no other legacy than the scholarship of all children my life would be blessed.  Tutors, you hold the future of Rome in your hands.  Teach them well so that they will bring honor to the Empire.  I salute you. \nCommodus actually bows before them, an unimaginable honor. \nThe tutors bow in response and herd the children out. \nCOMMODUS Look at them, Senators... my truest gift to Rome. \nGRACCHUS Darling children, to be sure, now if I may proceed? \nCOMMODUS (sighs) Very well... \nCommodus moves to the desk, standing over it and gazing at Marcus' scrolls as: \nGRACCHUS Caesar, your presence in Rome is an invaluable opportunity to begin correcting some of the ills that have beset the city since your father went to the wars.  We would like to -- \nCOMMODUS Peace, good Gracchus, peace... \nCommodus slowly begins pushing Marcus' papyrus scrolls off the desk to the floor, one by one, as: \nCOMMODUS My beloved father was a careless shepherd to his flock.  I shall be a good father to my children.  I shall remain in Rome and show them how they are loved. \nGRACCHUS With respect, sire, the people don't need love -- they need law.  The Senate has prepared a series of protocols to begin addressing the corruption in the city -- (Gaius hands him a scroll) -- starting with basic sanitation in the Hebrew Quarter.  If Caesar could study this and -- \nCOMMODUS You see that's the very problem, isn't it, my old, old friend?  My father spent all his time at study. At books and learning and philosophy... \nAs Commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk, tries it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave.  The chair is whisked away. \nCOMMODUS He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.  All the while, the people were forgotten. \nGRACCHUS The Senate is the people. \nCOMMODUS I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Senator Gracchus... \nAs Commodus speaks he moves to the bust of Marcus, studies it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave and the bust is whisked away.  Lucilla watches this closely. \nCOMMODUS I doubt many of the people have such splendid armor, Captain Marcellus. Or such fine mistresses, Senator Gaius.  No... only their true father knows what the people need.  I shall show them they are loved.  I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly -- \nGRACCHUS Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire? \nCommodus stops.  Looks at him.  A lethal moment. \nCOMMODUS No.  But if you interrupt me one more time I assure you that you shall.  I will emulate the immortal Caesars of the past.  I will give the people what they truly want. Starting this day I will draw all of Rome to the Colosseum.  I will give them bread.  And they will want nothing more. \nStartled looks between Gracchus, Gaius and Marcellus. \nGRACCHUS You want to hold games? \nCOMMODUS Not just any games, Senator!  A series of games that will make the Gods envious and leave my children happy!  I will subsidize the arena from this day forth -- and I will culminate this celebration in a great spectacle the likes of which the world has never seen!  A great spectacle to honor my father! Magnificent, unending weeks of festivity all in the name of Marcus Aurelius! \nA beat. \nGRACCHUS If I may, Caesar... how are you going to pay for this? \nCOMMODUS That is not your concern. \nGracchus ignores a warning look from Gaius. \nGRACCHUS Respectfully, sire, taxation and import duties are the exclusive province of the Senate -- \nCommodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral violence that everyone is shocked -- \nCOMMODUS MY FATHER DESERVES TO BE HONORED AND I WILL HONOR HIM! -- AND THE PEOPLE WILL LOVE ME! -- AND THE SENATE WILL OBEY ME OR EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL BURN!  BURN!  BURN! -- I WILL HAVE ORDER! \nHe snarls like a great jungle cat and he stalks away. Senator Falco quickly follows. \nA dreadful silence. \nThen: \nLUCILLA Gentlemen, in the future do not concern my brother with these matters.  Come to me. \nShe sweeps out. \nA beat. \nMARCELLUS Games?  He wants to hold games? \nGAIUS It's madness. \nA beat.  Proximo studies him. \nPROXIMO You fight like a soldier.  You have wounds like a soldier who has been on long campaigns.  You eye the world around you like an enemy. What is your name, Roman soldier? \nMAXIMUS Gladiator. \nA beat. \nPROXIMO And nothing more? \nMAXIMUS Nothing more. \nA beat. \nProximo watches Maximus very closely for the following: \nPROXIMO In two days we leave for Rome. \nMaximus' eyes suddenly flash to Proximo.  He is transfixed, his eyes burning. \nPROXIMO Ah... so it's Rome you want.  Well you shall have her, Gladiator.  The new Emperor has ordered a series of matches to culminate in a grand spectacle.  If you do well I shall become very, very rich.  If you do well enough I shall set you free. Is it freedom you want? \nA beat. \nMaximus shakes his head. \nPROXIMO (quietly) Not even that. \nMAXIMUS (barely controlled) The Emperor -- will he be there? \nPROXIMO Oh yes.  He's apparently quite mad about the games.  Spending a fortune, which is, needless to say, good for me again.  But what is good for you, Gladiator? \nMAXIMUS Have you -- how does one meet the Emperor? \nPROXIMO As a gladiator? \nMAXIMUS Yes. \nPROXIMO One doesn't. \nA beat.  Proximo sees that Maximus' mind is racing. \nPROXIMO Except... If one has proven oneself in battle.  If at the end of the games you are the final man standing -- the Emperor will present you with a small wooden sword.  The sword is your freedom. \nMAXIMUS He give it personally? \nPROXIMO He did to me... (Maximus is surprised at this) Our great father Marcus Aurelius looked into my eyes and touched me on the shoulder. \nMAXIMUS You knew Marcus? \nPROXIMO I didn't know him.  He touched me on the shoulder.  Just once.  But that was enough. \nA beat. \nPROXIMO All right, Gladiator.  We shall go to Rome together and have bloody adventures.  The Great Whore will suckle us until we are fat and happy and can't suck another drop.  That is Rome. \nINT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - OUTSIDE ROME - EVENING \nMaximus is crouched in the back of an enclosed slave wagon with Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators. \nIn the distance, Rome. \nINT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCommodus sits on his bed, rubbing his aching head. Lucilla is preparing a drink for him, a medicinal tonic. \nCOMMODUS All my desires are splitting my head to pieces -- there's so much I want to do -- but all my efforts to show my children they are loved go unappreciated by those dragons in the Senate -- \nLUCILLA (mixing tonic) Quiet, brother... \nUnseen by him, she adds a little special powder to the drink from a vial secreted in her robe. \nLUCILLA Leave the Senate to me.  Don't trouble yourself. \nCOMMODUS All I want is to be a good father to my people.  Why don't they understand that? \nShe goes to him. \nLUCILLA Shhh.  The tonic will help... \nShe takes a sip and then hands it to him. \nLUCILLA Yes, just drink this down. \nShe sits on the edge of the bed.  He drinks as: \nLUCILLA No -- cut off the head and the snake cannot strike. \nGRACCHUS Lucilla, Gaius is right.  Until the City Guard can neutralize the Praetorians we can accomplish nothing. \nMARCELLUS And I haven't enough men. \nLUCILLA What about the army? \nGAIUS No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years. \nLUCILLA So we do nothing?! \nA door opens, a voice... \nLUCIUS' VOICE Mother... \nAn eight-year-old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy.  He is LUCIUS, Lucilla's son. \nLUCIUS I heard voices... \nLUCILLA (going to him) It's all right, darling, you -- \nLucius suddenly notices Senator Gracchus: \nLUCIUS (running to Gracchus) Senator!  What did you bring me?! \nHe leaps onto Gracchus -- Gracchus laughs and pulls something from his robe. \nGRACCHUS For you prince Lucius... a sea monster! \nGracchus gives Lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea serpent. \nGRACCHUS Off the coast of Achaea they grow twenty times this size, with snapping teeth to devour any nasty Praetorians they come across... now, where is Achaea? \nLUCIUS Below Macedonia! \nGRACCHUS Show me on the map. \nLucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at Achaea.  We sense this is an old game between them. \nLUCILLA Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in shortly. \nLUCIUS (to Gracchus) Thank you, Senator Mountain! \nGRACCHUS You're welcome, Prince Anthill! \nLucius goes.  Lucilla shuts the door after him.  A moment. She turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes. \nLUCILLA What are you going to do? \nGracchus goes to her, holds her. \nGRACCHUS Peace child... One dark night the Gods will light our path.  They will give us the voice we need.  Have faith in that.  Have faith. \nINT./ EXT.  ROMAN STREETS - SLAVE WAGON - NIGHT \nMaximus cranes for a sight of the Eternal City through a hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart. \nHe can see only glimpses of Rome as they pass.  But the images are not what he expected.  Alongside the undeniable glory of the city, the madness and disease Marcus Aurelius spoke of are readily apparent. \nMaximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist Praetorian Guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent architecture of the city -- he sees starving children begging from filthy gutters -- he sees rich citizens out for a stroll -- he sees a swirling combination of sophistication and depravity, of civilization and corruption. \nHe sits back in the cart, deep in thought.  Vibius looks at him. \nVIBIUS Not what you expected? \nMAXIMUS No. \nVIBIUS Rome is nothing but a slaughter house.  And we are the meat. \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nThe slave wagon pulls up to Proximo's rather grand Roman compound.  Guards unlock imposing gates and the wagon drives in... \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT \nInside the gates is a large courtyard, much like Proximo's Moroccan school but much more impressive.  A fountain with an enormous statue of the war god Mars is central in the courtyard. \nThe gladiators climb from the wagon, stretching after the long journey.  Vibius leads Maximus and Juba to the statue.  He wades through the fountain and kisses the toe of Mars. \nVIBIUS Tradition.  He watches over us. \nJuba steps up and kisses the toe. \nVIBIUS (to Maximus) Oh go on, it won't kill you. \nMaximus and the others are lead by Proximo's guards down a long ramp and past countless animal cages.  Gamblers circulate everywhere and observe the warriors, angling for the best odds and the best matches. \nMaximus and the others are led even deeper into the bowels of the Colosseum to a new whole subterranean realm. Numerous cells line the walls.  Racks and racks of weaponry and armor. \nAnd, most striking, everywhere around them is the heavy machinery of the spectacles above.  Huge \"elevator\" platforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are manned by teams of sweating slaves. \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY \nFinally, Proximo's guards lead the gladiators to their holding cells.  These cells are right at the edge of the arena.  Barred windows offer a sand-level view of the action. \nMaximus immediately goes to a window and looks out. \nHe cannot see much of the entire arena, but what he does see transfixes him. \nA band of Christians are huddled together.  An eerie silence from the Colosseum but for the prayers of the Christians. \nMaximus watches them.  One little girl peels past her mother's arm.  She sees Maximus.  She smiles. \nSuddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by Maximus -- they roar into the arena -- \nWe do not see the carnage.  We watch Maximus' face as we hear the sounds of the slaughter. \nAnd the sound of the roaring crowd. \nMaximus finally cannot watch.  He drops his head. \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - TRAINER'S LAIR - DAY \nProximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the Colosseum's orator and majordomo, CASSIUS.  They are haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena itself.  Huge chalkboards chart the day's matches and wagers and odds. \nColosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing bouts. \nThe roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the Christians can clearly be heard. \nCASSIUS ... and the Emperor will have no more animal battles today -- \nUpset roars from some of the trainers. \nTRAINER #1 You promised me a bear match, Cassius! \nTRAINER #2 I have ten damned gorillas!  You said gorillas yesterday! \nCASSIUS Talk to the man in the imperial box. Who has the next slot...? (he checks the boards) -- Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and Proximo -- (to Proximo) -- Nice to have you back, you piratical bastard -- now listen, the Emperor wants the Carthage spectacle. \nThe four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance -- \nPROXIMO No -- have pity, Cassius -- ! \nTRAINER #3 My men are too good for -- ! \nCASSIUS You give us the Carthage match or lose your spot on the rotation -- but don't worry -- gold is flowing from the Emperor's fingers. \nTRAINER #3 It'll cost you -- \nPROXIMO I won't do it for less than 100,000 sesterces -- ! \nTRAINER #4 120,000!  All I have is my best Thracians! \nCASSIUS (to Proximo) And I want to see this famous Spaniard of yours -- his reputation soars from the provinces.  The people are eager for him -- \nPROXIMO I won't throw my Spaniard into a spectacle!  Damn you and damn the rotation! \nCASSIUS You will and the price will be 90,000 sesterces each -- (to all) -- which you all know is exorbitant -- AND IF YOU EXTORTING BLOOD-WHORES TRY TO PAWN OFF LESSER FIGHTERS ON ME I WILL SEE YOU DEAD IN THE ARENA TOMORROW! \nTRAINER #4 My Thracians are worth -- ! \nCASSIUS Give me your best, brothers.  They die before Caesar. \nHe strides back to the arena.  The touts instantly begin making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious \"Carthage Spectacle\" as some of the trainers hurry out. \nProximo walks with Trainer #4: \nPROXIMO I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will kill at least one of your Thracians. \nTRAINER #4 30,000?!  On a Spaniard?!  That provincial sun has curdled your brain! \nPROXIMO Then make the wager, you smug bastard! \nThey disappear down a dark corridor, negotiating all the while. \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY \nMaximus, Juba, Vibius and another of Proximo's gladiators are being armed.  They all wear mask-like helmets. \nProximo hurries to them. \nShe rivets him intensely with her eyes. \nLUCILLA By all the Gods, and in the name of my father who loved you, and in the name of the husband I loved... I swear to stand by your side in this now and always. \nA beat. \nMAXIMUS What is your son's name? \nLUCILLA Lucius Verus.  Like his father. \nMAXIMUS I weep for him. \nA long beat.  Maximus' cold eyes give away nothing. \nLucilla turns and starts to go.  She stops, not looking back. \nLUCILLA Commodus plans to kill you in your next match in the arena.  He's planning something.  I will pray for you.  As I have always done. \nShe then pulls something from her robes and sets it down, a little bundle wrapped in cloth.  She sweeps out.  The sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side. \nMaximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has left.  He opens the cloth.  Inside are his six \"ancestor\" figures. \nHe picks up one of the figures.  He looks at it deeply, gently feeling along the contours with a finger. \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY \nThe Colosseum is again packed.  Commodus, Lucilla and her son Lucius are in the Imperial Box. \nIt is late in the day and teams of slaves are cleaning the arena after a bout.  They haul off carcasses and toss down fresh sand. \nMeanwhile, Cassius is orating to the crowd: \nCASSIUS ... in his majestic charity the Emperor has deigned to this day favor the people of Rome with an historical final match.  Returning to the Colosseum today... after five years in retirement... Caesar is pleased to bring you... THE ONLY UNDEFEATED CHAMPION IN ROMAN HISTORY... (the crowd is going mad) ... THE LEGENDARY... TIGER OF GAUL!! \nThe crowd erupts in paroxysms of joy as TIGER explodes into the arena in an ornate chariot.  Tiger is a fierce man in his 40's, his brutal, scarred face and hugely muscled body a testament to his many years in the arena. \nTiger speeds around the rim of the arena in his chariot, raising an arm in triumph.  The crowd roars. \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY \nProximo stands with Maximus, who is busy strapping on armor. \nPROXIMO Gods!  That old Homicide!  The Emperor must truly hate you. \nMAXIMUS What can you tell me? \nPROXIMO He cheats. \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY \nTiger waits.  He stands in the center of the arena.  He has only a traditional short sword.  The crowd is breathless with anticipation.  As: \nCASSIUS (orating) And from the rocky promontories and martial bloodlines of Spain... representing the training lyceum of Proximo Antoninus... I give you... THE WARRIOR MAXIMUS! \nThe crowd cheers.  Maximus appears from his gate.  His fans have increased in number considerably.  They eagerly crane forward and celebrate him. \nMeanwhile, Maximus looks at Tiger.  Only one man with a sword?  Maximus approaches, cautious but confident. \nHe stops a few feet from Tiger.  They lock eyes, salute each other and then turn to the Imperial Box, raising their swords. \nThe crowd waits eagerly for the immortal words... \nMAXIMUS AND TIGER We who are about to die salute you. \nThe crowd cheers and Maximus immediately turns and starts slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back -- \nThe sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are perfectly matched -- \nAs he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels something -- a vibration in the ground -- \nSuddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous platforms rise into view.  On each platform is a snarling Bengal tiger restrained by a chain.  Tiger's teams of \"cornermen\" hold the chains through a pulley system.  The cornermen are safely inside cages.  The platforms stop at ground level. \nThe four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the battleground. \nTiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another tiger snaps at him -- \nTiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts -- \nAnd then all four tigers are suddenly closer.  The teams of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit, gradually reducing the size of the battle ground.  The crowd roars. \nBut the fight is hardly fair. \nWhenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a tiger they let it out a bit. \nMaximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally, Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under Tiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall -- a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back -- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat. \nGAIUS We've been ordered to attend. \nLUCILLA How many are with us? \nGRACCHUS About half.  But once the tyrant is dead.  All. \nA beat. \nGRACCHUS I want to meet him. \nLUCILLA I'll arrange it. \nGAIUS And what of the Emperor? \nA beat. \nLUCILLA He has withdrawn.  He's not eating. He doesn't go out.  He won't even see me... I don't know what tempests rage within him but... \nGRACCHUS We should fear for the blackest storm. \nLUCILLA Yes. \nA beat. \nGAIUS One question... who is to be the actual Regicide? \nA beat.  She glances at him. \nThe drums continue... \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY \nMaximus defeats his opponent.  He stands over him.  He does not kill him. \nHe tosses his sword down and walks away.  The crowd goes crazy, roaring their approval of Maximus. \nSenator Falco, sits in the stands and watches with some alarm.  He glances around as the crowd exalts Maximus.  He is becoming a hero to the people. \nThe drums continue... \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY \nMaximus returns to the holding cells.  Vibius and Juba are waiting. \nVIBIUS You didn't kill him. \nMAXIMUS I will not kill another warrior. There is no honor to it. \nMaximus goes.  Vibius thinks about it, listening to the adulation of the crowd. \nThe drums continue... \nINT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - ROMAN STREETS - DAY \nMaximus and the other gladiators are in a slave cart on the way from the arena.  A gang of children run alongside the cart, cheering and chanting: \nKIDS Maximus the Merciful!  Maximus the Merciful! \nThe drums continue... \nINT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT \nMaximus and Juba are with Lucilla and Gracchus.  Lucilla is writing on a piece of parchment. \nMAXIMUS Tell him we will enter Rome on the first day of Commodus' festival. \nLUCILLA And they will march on Rome for you? \nMAXIMUS Yes.  But this letter must go to the lieutenant named Titus, no one else. \nLUCILLA Captain Marcellus will take it.  And his City Guard will by with you when you get to Rome.  Is that enough to face the Praetorian Guard? \nMAXIMUS (looks to her) The Felix Regiment will never be defeated. \nA beat. \nGRACCHUS I only have one question for you, General... Why? \nA beat. \nGRACCHUS You will lead an army of your brothers on Rome.  Many will die. Why? \nMAXIMUS I want Commodus dead. \nGRACCHUS That's not the reason.  Tell me the truth. \nCOMMODUS It is my responsibility to make the world as it should be.  How is it I have made this world? \nLUCILLA Brother, do not be influenced by the mob.  They are a great, faceless beast -- \nCOMMODUS They are not \"the mob,\" Lucilla, they are the people.  They are my children and all I want to do is love them. \nA beat.  He stands before a bust of Marcus Aurelius.  He touches it. \nCOMMODUS Our father loved Maximus... and I love him still... yet he defies me, he tasks me in front of my children. And they love him for it.  Just as Marcus loved him for it.  Tell me why, Lucilla. \nLUCILLA They see themselves in him.  They throw in their own sad dreams alongside his.  They think he fights for them. \nCOMMODUS And what do I do but fight for them?!  I give them games to please them.  I strangle dissent to give them peace.  I empower the Praetorians to give them order. What more can I do?! \nA beat. \nCOMMODUS Say I should fight him, in the arena.  Let my children see who the Gods truly favor. \nLUCILLA And what if he should win? \nA beat. \nCommodus continues to slowly move around the room. \nCOMMODUS A God is more powerful than a man... \nThis odd statement hangs in the air for a moment.  Then: \nLUCILLA Caesar, you let this unduly worry you.  At best he is a passing fancy -- he is a name, an image on a banner, ephemeral -- he will be forgotten as the next fancy appears -- \nCOMMODUS But I need to know -- why do they love him? \nLUCILLA Mercy. \nHe stops.  Looks at her. \nLUCILLA He will not kill in the arena.  He is merciful.  As they all wish they were in their own hearts. \nSomething in her words has struck a chord in him. \nCOMMODUS And for that moment in the arena they are merciful too.  For a moment... they are Gods.  Offering life. \nHe looks at her. \nCOMMODUS But who can be more merciful than the Emperor of Rome? \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY \nMaximus is fighting a thick GIANT of a man.  A few quick blows and the Giant falls -- like a mighty tree he crashes to the sand. \nThe arena cheers their hero. \nMaximus stands over the beaten Giant.  The crowd waits for the famous act. \nMaximus salutes the Giant and tosses down his sword, refusing to kill.  He walks away. \nThe arena explodes in cheers -- a chant of \"Maximus the Merciful\" grows to deafening proportions. \nSuddenly the arena is filled with Praetorians -- they block Maximus' exit from the arena -- the crowd boos -- horrified -- \nThe Praetorians surround Maximus.  He is unarmed, but coils for the inevitable battle. \nThen the Praetorians part... \nAnd Commodus walks through them.  He carries something wrapped in a rich cloth.  Maximus glares at him. \nThe Praetorians move back and the crowd watches eagerly. The Emperor and the Gladiator, at last. \nMaximus and Commodus stare at each other.  The crowd cannot hear what is said, but strain to observe this incredible confrontation. \nCOMMODUS Brother... we've taken a sad path since we were children at Capri, have we not? \nMaximus doesn't answer. \nCOMMODUS For my own part... I am sorry it came to this.  And to you alone of all men, I acknowledge my errors. And my regret.  I shall live with my sin for all my days. \nMAXIMUS As will I, Commodus.  As will I. \nCommodus unwraps the cloth bundle.  Inside is a small wooden sword.  He holds it up so the crowd can see. \nA collective gasp.  The wooden sword, prized by all gladiators above all else.  Freedom. \nCOMMODUS As the first act of my contrition I offer you the wooden sword of freedom. \nHe holds out the wooden sword.  A beat. \nAnd then he slowly walks right to her.  His face an inch away from hers. \nCOMMODUS Where is my sister? \nINT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT \nProximo sits, considering Maximus. \nMAXIMUS Was it Centurion...?  General...? \nPROXIMO Captain. \nA beat. \nPROXIMO How did you know? \nMAXIMUS A soldier knows a soldier. \nA beat. \nPROXIMO All that was a long time ago.  Too much wine and too many women.  And too much money. \nMAXIMUS No -- \nPROXIMO This is who I am... (he pats his ample belly) You see?  There was a time I would stand against ten men and never give an inch, spitting into the jaws of Hades all the while.  There was a time my heart swelled to strap on the armor of Rome.  But now... \nSomething flashes across Proximo's eyes, something like tragedy. \nPROXIMO Now I am just an entertainer. \nA pause. \nMAXIMUS You said something to me once.  You said in this life, we all die.  All we can choose is how we die.  And how we are remembered.  Do you recall those words? \nPROXIMO Yes. \nMAXIMUS Then be remembered proudly.  This is your time, Proximo.  Stand at my side and be what you were.  What you truly are.  One last time. \nA beat. \nProximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically -- Maximus is a bit taken aback -- Proximo dramatically flicks tears from his eyes -- and then can't keep the show up -- he bursts into laughter. \nMaximus stares at him. \nPROXIMO (laughing) You might have spared yourself the speech, General.  The lady Lucilla bought all my gladiators two hours ago! \nMAXIMUS You pox-ridden bastard -- ! \nPROXIMO I am the richest trainer in the Empire!  And I will let my gladiators do anything you like! Conspire away, General! \nMaximus can only laugh as well. \nPROXIMO But I tell you -- if you survive this madness I want you to go into business with me.  I'll give you a quarter of my holdings. \nMAXIMUS (standing) A quarter?! \nPROXIMO A third.  And not a hair more.  And you'll have to start in the provinces!  Cleaning up the lion shit! \nMAXIMUS You know, if you were half so awful as you pretend, you'd be a terrifying man. \nMaximus shakes his head, smiling, and goes. \nProximo sits for a moment. \nThen he rises and goes to a heavy chest.  He looks at the chest for a moment and then opens it. \nInside is his old Lorica Segmentata.  He gazes at his armor, considering what he once was.  And what he now is. \nINT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT \nMaximus enters.  Lucilla is waiting, extremely tense. \nMAXIMUS Lucilla -- \nLUCILLA Don't even say it.  I know it's dangerous -- but I had to see you. Captain Marcellus has gone to the army with your message as you instructed. \nMAXIMUS Good. \nLUCILLA He says the City Guard will be ready at the south road at noon.  They can only wait for an hour so -- \nMAXIMUS You've told me this already. \nLUCILLA Did I?  All right then.  So everything is prepared.  The Senate will be in attendance and you have your gladiators -- the usual cohort of Praetorians will be inside the arena -- \nMAXIMUS Lucilla... why are you here? \nProximo is asleep -- a sound outside wakes him -- the steady clip-clop of horses on stone.  A lot of horses. \nHe rises and goes to a window overlooking the street outside. \nA stern Praetorian Guard cavalry unit is cantering into position at his gates.  Proximo grabs his clothes -- \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nWith cool military precision the Praetorians take up position at the gates before Proximo's compound, an unassailable line.  They quickly prepare their bows. \nMeanwhile, another Praetorian unit has taken up position at the other end of Proximo's compound -- sealing that entrance as well. \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT \nProximo is hurrying across his open courtyard when the first flaming arrow arches into the compound -- it is followed by hundreds more -- \nThe Praetorians on either end of his compound keep up a ceaseless hail of flaming arrows -- everything begins to burn -- the caged gladiators are stirring now -- shouting -- \nProximo races to his panicked guards -- \nPROXIMO Release them!  Release them all! ARM THEM! \nThe guards sprint to the cells -- unlocking the gladiators as quickly as they can -- \nNot quick enough for many -- Praetorians are now pouring pitch through the gutter that runs along the bottom of the cells -- igniting it and incinerating all those trapped inside -- \nThe compound is soon a raging inferno -- \nProximo releases Maximus and Juba -- \nPROXIMO Come -- \nMAXIMUS But -- \nPROXIMO If you want to live -- follow me -- \nVIBIUS (calling to them) Go, Spaniard!  We'll show these Roman dogs how gladiators fight! \nProximo hauls Maximus and Juba off as Vibius and the other gladiators arm themselves -- \nINT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT \nProximo is leading Maximus and Juba quickly through a decaying cramped tunnel. \nPROXIMO All the old gladiator schools have tunnels to the Colosseum -- most have long since collapsed -- \nJUBA How did they know? \nMAXIMUS We were betrayed. \nJUBA (stops) I'll stay here.  In case they follow. \nMaximus stops as well. \nJUBA Go!  Bring us the army! \nMaximus nods. \nPROXIMO Quickly -- \nHe leads Maximus down the disintegrating catacomb of tunnels -- \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nVibius hoped to die fighting -- he never got the chance. \nIt is not a battle, it is a slaughter. \nThe Praetorians ruthlessly shoot anyone even approaching the gates -- all the walls are covered -- most of the gladiators die in the hellish inferno -- the relentless rain of flaming arrows continues -- \nVibius coughs in the thick smoke and rages for someone to fight -- Praetorian snipers cut him down -- he dies reaching for the statue of Mars. \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - SUBTERRANEAN - NIGHT \nProximo and Maximus emerge deep in the bowels of the Colosseum. \nPROXIMO (points) Down that corridor is the butchery -- the blood sloughs lead to the Tiber.  Gods watch over you. \nMAXIMUS You're not coming? \nPROXIMO They are killing my men! \nHe races back into the tunnel. \nMaximus moves quickly down the corridor.  He can finally see... \nAt his cue, two elevator platforms rumble into view, rising from the bowels of the Colosseum to the arena sand. \nOn each platform is a cage full of ferocious wolves, they snap and growl, straining to be released. \nCOMMODUS So it was for Romulus and Remus, sons of Mars, so shall it be for us! The great She-Wolf will -- \nSuddenly -- the huge wooden doors of the arena burst open and Maximus leads the Felix Regiment cavalry thundering into the arena. \nThe crowd is stunned -- Commodus is stunned -- Lucilla bolts up -- \nCommodus immediately spins to Lucilla, his eyes burning -- \nHis Praetorian are momentarily confused -- \nAt Gallus' command the Felix Regiment archers let fly -- multiple arrows and bolts cut through most of the Praetorians -- some confusing skirmishes as the remaining Praetorians fire back -- \nMaximus leaps from his horse and begins cutting the prisoners free -- \nMeanwhile, Commodus strides back down the platform toward Lucilla in the Imperial Box, murder in his eyes -- \nShe suddenly hugs Lucius quickly and kisses him -- \nLUCILLA Remember your mother. \nShe pulls the ceremonial dagger from his little uniform and pushes him to his attendant -- his attendant pulls him away as -- \nLucilla spins to Commodus -- he grabs her into an embrace -- he turns the knife on her -- thrusting deeply as he kisses her -- \nA long kiss as he holds her tightly to him.  Then he gently sits her down on her throne.  Her eyes wide, dying. \nOne of Commodus' Body Guards grabs him: \nCENTURION BODY GUARD Caesar -- we must go -- ! \nCommodus' six Centurion Body Guards begin hustling him out of the Imperial Box -- \nCOMMODUS GET THE BOY! \nHe grabs Lucius from his attendant and drags him off -- \nThey try to escape out the back of the Imperial Box -- but Felix Regiment troops are blocking their way -- racing up toward them -- \nCENTURION BODY GUARD THIS WAY, CAESAR! \nBelow, through the confusion, Maximus sees Commodus escaping with Lucius down through a side tunnel. \nMaximus cuts Juba and Proximo free.  Juba immediately snatches up a sword.  Maximus quickly offers a sword to Proximo. \nMAXIMUS Captain? \nProximo takes the sword. \nMAXIMUS (re: Commodus and the others) Where are they going?! \nPROXIMO This way! \nThey race across the arena and into a tunnel... \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - BOWELS - DAY \nProximo leads them through a series of catacombs -- damp tunnels shoot off in every direction -- everywhere around them the heavy machinery of the games rise like mammoth creatures to the arena above -- a baroque network of ropes and pulleys and counterweights and elevator platforms and air shafts and blood sewers -- And they suddenly run directly into Commodus, dragging Lucius, and his six Centurions coming the other direction. \nThe final battle begins with no preamble -- \nMaximus launches himself forward -- instantly separating Commodus and Lucius -- he slams at Commodus with his sword -- Commodus slams back -- \nProximo and Juba race into the six Centurions -- a wild free-for-all as they prove their worth as warriors -- Juba fights with his usual elegant precision -- Proximo fights as a man reborn, alive again -- \nProximo takes cagey advantage of his knowledge of this subterranean world -- spinning around machinery and leaping over blood sewers and swinging heavy counterweights -- \nMaximus and Commodus hack at each other with all the fiery passion in them -- Commodus is a perfect match for Maximus and equally ruthless -- their swords thrust and parry and slice at amazing speed -- one false move, one mistake, means death -- \nMeanwhile, the battle is turning into a victory for Juba and Proximo -- they are defeating the Centurions -- Commodus sees this -- and sees Lucius crying in a corner -- \nHe screams to one of his remaining Centurions: \nCOMMODUS KILL THE BOY! \nMaximus whirls to Lucius -- Commodus attacks -- slashing Maximus' shoulders -- Maximus sees Proximo racing to try and save Lucius as he spins back to battle Commodus -- \nA Centurion raises his sword to kill Lucius -- Juba kills his final opponent, turns -- Proximo just manages to push Lucius out of the way -- the Centurion's sword slices into him -- \nJuba flings his sword across the room -- the final Centurion falls -- \nMaximus sees Proximo collapse to a wall -- dying -- Proximo locks eyes with Maximus as he slides down the wall.  The old pirate shrugs.  And is dead. \n", "test1_input": "GLADIATOR \nby \nDavid Franzoni \nRevised by John Logan \nSECOND DRAFT \nOctober 22, 1998 \n\"While stands the Colosseum, Rome shall stand. When falls the Colosseum, Rome shall fall. And when Rome falls -- the World.\" \nByron \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  FOREST - DAY \nGermania.  The far reaches of the Roman Empire. \nWinter 180 A.D. \nIncongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a beautiful tenor voice.  Singing.  A boy's voice. \nCREDITS as we hear the haunting song float through dense forests.  We finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing through the forest.  On the road a GERMAN PEASANT FATHER is herding along three sickly looking cows.  His two SONS are with him.  His youngest son sits on one of the cows and sings a soft, plaintive song. \nThey become aware of another sound behind them on the road -- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.  The Father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the road.  They stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture of subjugated peoples throughout history. \nA wagon train rumbles past them.  Three ornate wagons followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed PRAETORIAN GUARDS. \nThe young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans. His eyes burn with hatred. \nINT.  WAGON - DAY \nMist momentarily obscures a man's face.  Frozen breath. The man is in his 20's, imperious and handsome.  He is swathed in fur, only his face exposed.  He is COMMODUS. \nHe glances up. \nCOMMODUS Do you think he's really dying? \nThe woman across from him returns his gaze evenly.  She is slightly older, beautiful and patrician.  A formidable woman. \nShe is LUCILLA. \nLUCILLA He's been dying for ten years. \nCOMMODUS I think he's really dying this time. \nA beat.  Their breath turns instantly to mist. \nCOMMODUS He has to be bled every night now. \nLUCILLA How do you know that? \nCOMMODUS I've been so informed. \nShe arches an eyebrow. \nCOMMODUS If he weren't really dying he wouldn't have sent for us. \nLUCILLA (a smile) Maybe he just misses us. \nCOMMODUS And the Senators.  He wouldn't have summoned them if -- \nLUCILLA Peace, Commodus.  After two weeks on the road your incessant scheming is hurting my head. \nA beat. \nCOMMODUS The first thing I shall do is honor him with games worthy of his majesty. \nLUCILLA The first thing I shall do is have a hot bath. \nThe wagon rumbles to a halt.  Voices are heard outside. \nCommodus leaps out... \nEXT.  WAGON - OUTPOST - DAY \nThree Roman SOLDIERS guard an outpost, a watchtower, on the roadside. \nCOMMODUS Why have we stopped? \nPRAETORIAN GUARD MEMBER We're here, sir. \n", "test1_true": "SOLDIER #1 He's at the front, sir. \nCOMMODUS Is the battle won? \nSOLDIER #1 Don't know, sir.  They've been gone for eight days. \nCommodus tosses off his furs -- beneath them he wears a beautiful set of Lorica Segmentata -- the traditional formed armor of Rome.  He moves to a horse as: \nCOMMODUS (to Soldier #1) My sister wants a bath, take her to the camp. (to Soldier #2) Take me to my father. \nHe leaps onto the horse and canters back to the Praetorian Guard unit. \nSoldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them.  Commodus rides off with most of the Praetorian Guard unit. \nLucilla peeks her head from the wagon.  She glances at the remaining soldiers.  Distinctly unpromising. \nLUCILLA (dry) Civilization at last.  Gods preserve us. \nEXT.  HILL - TWILIGHT \nThe mighty catapults dwarf the humans.  Soldiers from the elite Felix Regiment -- a legion of the Roman Army -- haul the monstrous machines up a hill. \nThe commanding General of the Felix Regiment, MAXIMUS, walks between two of the catapults.  He is a striking and intense man in his 30's.  Like all the soldiers who surround him, he is caked with mud and exhausted. \nHe trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants, TITUS and QUINTUS. \nTITUS You would do as well to read the mind of a rhinoceros. \nQUINTUS These barbarians would rather drown in blood than yield an inch.  If I didn't hate them so much I would admire them. \nThey have reached the top of the hill.  Stunning martial preparations are underway.  The catapults join ten others. Archers are taking up position.  Brutal \"Scorpions\" -- devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being loaded.  Soldiers are also loading the catapults with enormous \"Greek fire pots\" -- large, round terra cotta pots. \nMaximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop. Below them they can see a German encampment. \nTITUS They simply will not surrender. \nA beat as Maximus gazes down at the German position. \nMAXIMUS (quietly) A people should know when they are conquered. \nA beat. \nMAXIMUS At the first signal release the catapults.  We'll use the cavalry to cut off the retreat. \nQUINTUS General, I don't recommend that. Our cavalry might be caught in the flames. \nMAXIMUS I hope not, because I'm going to be leading them. \nA beat as he gazes down at the enemy. \nMAXIMUS Why don't they know they're already dead? \nEXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT \nMaximus and Titus are on their horses, the cavalry of two hundred Felix Regiment warriors surrounds them.  Steam flares from their horses' nostrils.  They wait in a thick stand of trees -- the German position can be seen across a muddy plain. \nA large wolf -- \"The Wolf of Rome\" -- waits at Maximus' side. \nMaximus nods to an archer.  The archer lights the tip of an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky. \nEXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT \nQuintus waits.  The catapults are loaded and waiting.  So too the Scorpions.  So too the 200 archers of the Felix Regiment. \nHe sees the flaming arrow flying up from below. \nQUINTUS Now! \nThe mighty catapults are released.  The Greek fire pots arc dramatically through the air.  A moment later soldiers release the Scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through the sky.  The archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming arrows. \nEXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT \nThe screaming is almost immediate. \nMaximus and his cavalry watch as the fire pots crash down into the German encampment. \nEXT.  GERMAN CAMP - TWILIGHT \nThe fire pots shatter -- pitch splashes everywhere -- seconds later the bolts and flaming arrows slice down and ignite the pitch -- FLAME EXPLODES -- it is a hellish, napalm-like vision -- the conflagration illuminating the twilight. \nThe deadly rain of flaming arrows spreads terror through the German camp -- \nEXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT \nMaximus watches the German camp. \n", "test1_id": 60, "test2_input": "The crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy.  But then an enormous roar grows from the crowd -- wave after wave of adulation for the hero of the day. \nMaximus looks around, taking it all in. \nThen he turns to the Imperial Box. \nMaximus slowly walks to before the the Imperial Box.  The Praetorian Archers immediately raise their bows, pointing down at him. \nMaximus glares up at Commodus through his helmet mask. Commodus returns his gaze, curious. \nThe crowd is intrigued, growing quiet.  What is going on? \nThen Maximus simply turns and begins walking away. \nCOMMODUS Slave!  Who are you? \nThe Colosseum is suddenly silent.  The Emperor is speaking to a gladiator. \nMaximus keeps walking. \nCOMMODUS SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU? \nMaximus keeps walking, his fists clenched now. \nCommodus suddenly grabs a spear from a nearby Praetorian and hurls it with perfect aim -- the crowd gasps -- the spear sails past Maximus -- actually nicking his shoulder -- it slices into the sand ahead of Maximus. \nMaximus stops. \nCOMMODUS SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?! \nMaximus can hold it no longer.  He spins to Commodus -- ripping off his helmet mask -- and THUNDERING: \nMAXIMUS I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS AURELIUS! \nCommodus eyes shoot wide -- Lucilla bolts up -- Gracchus leans forward -- Proximo is stunned -- the crowd is mystified -- \nMAXIMUS I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE! \nThe Praetorian Archers tense their bows -- ready to kill the defiant slave -- \nBut something extraordinary stops them.  Almost as one being the crowd roars -- they leaps to their feet and thrust their thumbs up!  They cheer and stomp their approval of Maximus. \nCommodus looks around at the people of Rome, amazed. \nHe finally plasters on a benevolent smile and thrusts his thumb up!  The Praetorians lower their bows. \nAnd the crowd cheers.  Never in the long, long history of the Colosseum have they ever seen such a thing. \nMaximus leads his gladiators out of the arena. \nINT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT \nTo our great surprise, Commodus is not raging.  He sits quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model of the Colosseum.  He moves model pieces around in the Colosseum, planning his festival. \nLucilla stands, tense. \nCOMMODUS Why is he still alive? \nLUCILLA I don't know. \nCOMMODUS He shouldn't be alive.  That vexes me.  I am terribly vexed... \nLucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the explosion.  He carefully moves some model pieces in the arena. \nCOMMODUS There, that's better.  Do you like the platform here? \nLUCILLA Mmm. \nCOMMODUS I do too.  Simple, elegant... \nLucilla is growing more and more unnerved at Commodus' unusual serenity. \nCOMMODUS Father would have wanted something more ornate but he's dead now. \nA beat.  Commodus laughs.  A beat. \nCOMMODUS Maximus Meridas haunts me.  I see Father turning away from me and gazing at him.  How many times did I suffer that indignity, I wonder? \nLUCILLA What are you going to do? \nCOMMODUS I'm going to kill him. \nLUCILLA Good. \nCOMMODUS (glances at her) Oh, you're too clever, Sister. Don't tell me part of you won't weep for him. \n", "test2_true": "COMMODUS No? \nLUCILLA The people embraced him today.  They will be expecting his next match... (she kneels next to him) ... let him die in the arena like the slave he is.  Let the people see what comes of defying Caesar. \nA beat as he looks at her. \nCOMMODUS He wounded you deeply, didn't he? Long ago. \nShe does not answer. \nCOMMODUS Nonetheless, your political acumen is, as always, unerring. \nHe picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena.  He looks at the model tiger and smiles. \nINT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT \nMaximus silently awaits Commodus' assassins with Juba. They hear footsteps outside the cell.  Maximus stands, preparing for death. \nJUBA (also standing) I will fight with you. \nMAXIMUS This isn't your battle. \nJUBA Better to die for a friend than to die for gold. \nThe door swings open and they are surprised to see Proximo sweeping in with a cloaked woman.  The woman gives Proximo a bag of money. \nPROXIMO Enjoy yourself, Madame... (he glances to Maximus) General, perform well and there will be riches for you. \nHe beckons to Juba, they go, shutting the door behind them.  The woman pulls off her cloak, it is Lucilla. \nMaximus glares at her, his muscles tensing. \nLUCILLA Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions. \nMaximus backs up, fighting the urge to strangle her on the spot.  He finally bumps into a wall of the cell. \nMAXIMUS I knew your brother would send assassins.  I didn't think he would send his best. \nLUCILLA Maximus, listen to me -- \nMAXIMUS My family were crucified and burnt while they were still alive. \nLUCILLA I knew nothing of that. \nMAXIMUS (low) Don't lie to me. \nLUCILLA I wept for them. \nMAXIMUS Don't. \nA long, tense moment. \nShe does not look at him. \nLUCILLA Do you know what it is to be the daughter of the Emperor?  I learned on the night my father had my husband killed.  I loved my husband very much.  Very... simply.  He was a man who believed in the Republic. He was a man who thought Marcus should be tending to Rome and not conquering the world.  One night my father had him strangled for conspiring with the Senate.  My father never spoke of it.  I never spoke of it.  That is what it is to be the daughter of Rome. \nShe finally looks up at Maximus. \nLUCILLA My son will live.  He will survive this cursed bloodline.  Rome will die and the jackals will pick her clean -- but my son will survive. Empires come and go.  Cities crumble to dust.  Only family matters. \nA beat.  Despite himself, Maximus is moved. \nMAXIMUS My son was innocent. \nLUCILLA So is mine. \nA beat. \nMAXIMUS I want your brother dead. \nLUCILLA So do I. \nA beat.  Maximus is surprised at her direct answer. \nLUCILLA My son will never be safe while he lives. \nA beat. \nMAXIMUS How do you plan it? \nLUCILLA The Senate is with us, and the City Guard.  We have growing power in the streets.  But we need a leader. Someone the people can -- \nMAXIMUS So the crown passes to your son. \nLUCILLA No.  So that my son will be safe. So that we may leave this charnel house forever and never look back. Look into my eyes, Maximus, and believe what I say to you... \n", "test2_id": 61, "test3_input": "Maximus begins marching through the camp, the wolf at his side.  Soldiers stir, amazed to see their General is alive. \nGallus leaps up, stunned, and goes to Maximus.  They continue to march through the camp, more and more astonished soldiers joining them. \nThey march toward the large tents at the center of the encampment. \nTitus emerges from his tent.  Slams to a stop -- \nTITUS By all the Gods... \nHe goes to Maximus and embraces him. \nMAXIMUS Old friend... \nTITUS You're returned from Hades!  By all the Gods! \nMAXIMUS Where is he? \nJust then Quintus emerges from the largest tent.  He stares at Maximus, unbelieving. \nA long beat as they look at each other. \nQuintus knows his destiny.  With quiet dignity he begins whispering a prayer.  Maximus moves to him, embracing him: \nMAXIMUS I forgive you. \nHe stabs Quintus with a dagger as he embraces him. Quintus falls. \nA beat. \nTitus goes to the dead Quintus and pulls the seal of office from his uniform.  He hands it to Maximus. \nAn enormous roar of celebration from the Felix Regiment. \nINT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - MORNING \nA castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration. Their eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate around Commodus' bedroom. \nThe Emperor himself is in a chair, wrapped in a robe.  His body slaves work over him closely. \nHe is staring into a mirror, lost in another world as the slaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him. \nThe castrati hymn continues... \nEXT.  OUTSIDE THE COLOSSEUM - DAY \nThe hymn is all we hear as we see crowds moving into the Colosseum... \nIt seems that all of Rome is here for this great day. Huge throngs of citizens move like a massive wave toward the Colosseum entrances.  Vendors are doing brisk business.  Praetorian units in full dress uniform canter past. \nWe elegantly float up along the outer tiers of the Colosseum and then glide over the edge to see the arena stands... \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY \nThe hymn is all we hear as we see... \nThe stands are filling.  We see the rich and poor alike. We see the orator Cassius.  We see Senator Falco and most of the Senate.  We see the cohort of fifty Praetorian taking up position around the Imperial Box. \nA golden platform, with stairs down to the arena sand, now extends about twenty feet from the Imperial Box to a spot over the arena. \nWe float down the stairs and then we see the arena itself... \nIt is stunning in its simplicity. \nThe days victims are tied to posts in the center of the arena.  Suspended above them is an enormous cloud.  A thick, tumescent bladder painted to look like a threatening rain cloud. \nWe see Proximo and Juba.  We see Senators Gracchus and Gaius.  We see Gaius' wife and Gracchus catamite and Christian families and scholars and actors. \nSeven stylized hills surround them. \nThe hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the damned. \nTIME CUT: \nLater.  By now, the Colosseum is packed.  All fifty-five thousand seats are taken.  Another ten thousand stand wherever they can.  A feral anticipation buzzes through the crowd. \nOutside the Colosseum, the streets are crowded with thousands more who couldn't get in. \nTrumpets blare. \nCommodus' six Centurion Body Guards stride into the Imperial Box. \nThen Commodus enters.  He is shrouded in a full lion's skin, the head of the lion concealing his own.  His head is down, he does not look up. \nLucilla and Lucius enter after him and sit.  Lucilla's face is drained, her eyes defeated.  Lucius is wearing a miniature set of Lorica Segmentata, complete with ceremonial dagger. \n", "test3_true": "A mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the outskirts of Rome.  The street is deserted.  It seems that almost everyone is at the Colosseum. \nThe dog stops.  Looks up. \nThen a sound is heard.  The steady cadence of horses' hooves. \nThe Felix Regiment rounds a corner.  Maximus leads the cavalry.  He wears Lorica Segmentata.  His corps of archers and soldiers follow.  They troop down the dusty street. \nMaximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog. \nQUICK CUTS: \nThe Felix Regiment moves through the streets.  The few pedestrians quickly disappear into shops and around corners.  The roar of the Colosseum can be heard far in the distance... \nArrows slice into isolated Praetorian sentries.  The Felix Regiment continues its stealth invasion... \nFinally, Maximus reins his horse and his troops stop. \nThe mounted City Guard are waiting. \nWithout a word, the City Guard joins Maximus and the two combined forces continue their inexorable march to the Colosseum. \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY \nCommodus, still swathed in the lion skin, his head down, slowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the Imperial Box. \nThe crowd grows hushed. \nCommodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a moment.  Then he dramatically flings off the lion skin. \nThe crowd gasps. \nHe is almost naked, his entire chiseled body is painted in gold.  His eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks around at his people. \nHe finally speaks: \nCOMMODUS (serene) Rome... This is the day that was foretold.  This is the day when your father takes away all fear... (he holds up his hands) With these hands I shall destroy your enemies so that you may sleep always and forever in peace.  From this day forth let it be known that I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, have surmounted mortality.  That I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, assume my destined place... at the side of the Gods. \nThe crowd is stunned.  A few scattered laughs. \nLucilla stares at him, disbelieving. \nCOMMODUS And as a righteous God, I shall ever protect you.  I shall cradle the world on my benevolent hands and clasp it to my heart.  So I have spoken!  And let the heavens tremble at my might! \nEXT.  ROMAN STREETS - DAY \nMaximus continues to lead the combined Felix Regiment and City Guard cavalry through the streets.  The roaring is closer now.  They are nearing the Colosseum, they can just glimpse the edge of the top tier over some building. \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY \nCommodus continues: \nCOMMODUS This day I reclaim Rome for her people.  I shall give you the rebirth of your Empire!  Reborn and cleansed of her enemies! \nHe raises his arms.  At his cue the Praetorian archers raise their bows, ready, aiming at the victims. \nCOMMODUS I will make a new Rome!  Founded as it was at the beginning!  Archers -- GIVE US BLOOD! \nThe Praetorians suddenly point their bows higher and fire -- \nThey shoot the cloud -- the bladder EXPLODES and thick blood rains down on the victims -- the blood splashes over them, coating them. \nEXT.  OUTSIDE COLOSSEUM - DAY \nThe roar from the Colosseum is now deafening as Maximus and the City Guard round the final corner -- the Colosseum is before them -- the massive Praetorian Guard force is caught of guard -- with crisp military efficiency the Felix Regiment and the City Guard quickly canter into place, an unbroken line of seasoned warriors facing the Praetorians. \nThe huge mob outside the Colosseum is confused, intrigued, watching the face-off.  The mounted archers of the Felix Regiment have drawn their bows. \nMaximus looks down from his horse at a Praetorian Officer. \nMAXIMUS Throw down your weapons or we will kill you. \nA beat. \nThe Praetorian Officer glances at the formidable force against him.  He drops his sword.  His men follow suit. \nMAXIMUS (he turns to his men) FELIX REGIMENT!  DO HONOR TO YOUR ANCESTORS!  I SALUTE YOU! \nHe spurs his horse and the Felix Regiment roars, springing into action -- they gallop through the crowd and to the Colosseum -- meanwhile the City Guard disarm and guard the Praetorian -- \nEXT.

{"test1_input": "JUBA For your wound... \nMaximus stares at him. \nJUBA (nods) For your wound. \nMaximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side. \nJuba carefully places his poultice over the wound -- Maximus hisses in pain -- Juba massages the poultice into the wound gently as: \nJUBA If you die in the wagons they feed you to the lions... The lions are worth more than we are.  I think we are worth more than the zebras though.  So they don't feed us to them. \nMaximus stares at him.  Juba looks down at him with the barest hint of a smile. \nJUBA I'm not sure about the giraffe. \nEXT.  SLAVE MARKET - DAY \nThe heat of Morocco is unlike anything Maximus has ever known.  Shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand. \nThe provincial market is bustling like the proverbial anthill.  Slave traders and dealers and merchants move around, all talking very quickly and very emphatically. \nMaximus, Juba and a number of other slaves are on display, poked and prodded and fondled.  Their BEDOUIN SLAVE TRADER sings out their praises to any passers. \nThe crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival of PROXIMO.  Proximo is a large man of immense appetites. He has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate.  Two slaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with switches. \nSLAVE TRADER Proximo, my old friend, see what I have for you today -- ! \nProximo SLAMS a fist into the Slave Trader's face.  The Slave Trader sails back. \nPROXIMO Those giraffes you sold me won't mate!  All they do is run around not mating!  YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH GIRAFFES!! \nThe Slave Trader pulls himself up, hugely obsequious. \nSLAVE TRADER I will make it up to you, Master. It's bargain day for you!  Look, look, look -- I have two lions and a panther -- hear how they roar for you!  \"Bring me home, Proximo!\" \nProximo examines the animals. \nPROXIMO How much for the lot? \nSLAVE TRADER For you -- 8,000 sesterces. \nPROXIMO For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want to see their balls first.  And you throw in those two slaves. \nSLAVE TRADER (moves to Maximus) What about this one?  Look at the arms! \nProximo moves to Maximus.  The Slave Trader forces open Maximus' mouth. \nPROXIMO Good teeth -- \nProximo notes the many old battle scars on Maximus' body. \nPROXIMO Where did you get those scars? \nMaximus doesn't respond. \nPROXIMO Are you a soldier? \nMaximus doesn't respond. \nPROXIMO Do you speak? -- (he roars back to a slave) KEEP THOSE DAMN FLIES OFF ME! (back to Maximus) He's dying. \nSLAVE TRADER 1,000 sesterces. \nPROXIMO My ass... (moves to Juba) You throw in this one and we'll make it 7,000 sesterces for the whole lot. \nSLAVE TRADER I have to eat, Master!  He's my finest, I couldn't let him go as part of the lot for less than 9,000 total... (back to Maximus) I tell you this one is prime.  He's a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my men before he could be subdued! \nProximo looks at Maximus, notes the many battle scars again.  The scars, and something he senses in Maximus' eyes, is enough for Proximo to consider it. \nPROXIMO (to trader) All right, let's see. \nThe Slave Trader and his colleagues grab Maximus and bustle him across the market, unlocking his chains. Maximus has no idea what's going on. \nIn the center of the market place, a veritable GIANT of a man sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand.  He is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot chain shackled to his ankle.  A think metal helmet is riveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair emerging.  His dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in the helmet. \nThe Slave Trader puts a wooden sword in Maximus' hand and shoves him toward the Giant.  The Giant stands.  He towers over Maximus. \nThe Giant suddenly swings his sword -- he moves with remarkable quickness -- Maximus makes no attempt to block the blow -- it sends him flying to the ground. \nMaximus pulls himself up. \nThe Giant moves in and hits him again -- Maximus recoils -- the Giant hits him again -- Maximus falls. \nMaximus pulls himself up. \n", "test1_true": "Maximus pulls himself up. \nThe Giant is about to attack again -- \nPROXIMO (to Slave Trader) That's enough. \nSLAVE TRADER STOP!  STOP! \nHis colleagues race into the ring and haul the Giant away from Maximus.  The Giant quietly sits back on his stool. \nProximo studies Maximus for a moment and then glances to the Slave Trader. \nPROXIMO I'll give you 500 sesterces. \nSLAVE TRADER No -- no -- 1,000! \nPROXIMO (laughs) Come, don't quibble with your old friend.  I'll take the lions, the panther, the Numidian and this one for 7,000.  And I'll buy you the best whore in the town for two nights.  She's an enormous mountain of flesh who craves a stern hand. \nSLAVE TRADER How could I say no to my old friend Proximo? \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - DAY \nMaximus and Juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten other slaves, including a very scared and reedy SCRIBE. Other wagons are filled with exotic animals, including several lions. \nThe wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken through an imposing set of gates to... \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - DAY \nAn open compound in Proximo's school.  On one side of the compound is a series of cages filled with wild animals of every description -- including Proximo's two hapless giraffes. \nProximo's house slaves begin unloading the newly purchased exotic animals into cages as Maximus and the new slaves are unloaded.  Heavily armed guards supervise everything. \nBut Proximo's slaves are having a bit of a problem with one of the new lions -- it growls and resists them. \nWithout the slightest hesitation, Proximo thunders to the lion and grabs it by the mane -- manhandling it into a cage. \nPROXIMO COME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST! \nHe kicks the lion in the rear as he shoves it into the cage. \nProximo's provincial school resembles nothing so much as a seedy prison.  The fading grandeur of the decaying battlements and the sweeping North African architecture only slightly mitigate the brutal feel of the place. \nAnd if Maximus had any doubts as to Proximo's profession -- all doubts are washed away when he sees the compound. \nTwenty GLADIATORS are working out in the compound -- hacking at practice dummies and sparring.  The many heavily armed guards oversee everything.  The gladiators stop working out as they see the new slaves enter.  They eye their potential new opponents warily. \nOne huge, glowering gladiator -- VIBIUS -- watches with particular interest.  His eye is quickly drawn to the most obvious athlete:  Juba. \nThe new slaves are herded to the middle of the compound and house slaves immediately begin throwing buckets of water on them, cleaning them. \nMeanwhile, Proximo shrugs off his cloak.  A slave brings him wine as he give his \"welcoming speech\" to the new slaves: \nPROXIMO Slaves.  I am Proximo, trainer of gladiators.  You live and die at my pleasure.  Fight well and you will live.  Fight poorly and you will die.  It is better to live. \nSlaves now toss thick handfuls of powdered lime on the new slaves -- they cough and clench their eyes shut, the lime coats and stings their wet bodies. \nPROXIMO Here you will be trained in the art of combat.  Here you will be given the tools to survive.  Please my patrons in the arena and all the gifts of the world will be showered upon you.  Imagine riches beyond your paltry dreams of riches! Imagine fame beyond your rude understanding of the word!  All this can belong to the select few who prove their worth in the arena. \nSlaves throw more water on the new slaves -- washing off the lime. \nPROXIMO If... on the other hand... you disappoint me... you will be dismembered and fed to my jackals limb by limb. \nHe gazes evenly at his new acquisitions. \nPROXIMO And my jackals are always hungry. \nHe strides off and the guards shove the new gladiators toward their cells. \nINT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - MAXIMUS' CELL - NIGHT \nMaximus and Juba share a small, filthy cell.  The cell door faces the open compound.  Across the compound they can see the much more comfortable cells of the \"star\" gladiators such as Vibius. \nThey both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall. Juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon. Maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not touched them. \nJUBA Have you killed a man before? \nMaximus does not respond. \nJUBA You should eat.  You'll need your strength tomorrow. \nMaximus does not respond. \nJUBA I've never killed a man.  But I think you have. \nMaximus does not respond. \n", "test1_id": 60, "test2_input": "LUCILLA No -- cut off the head and the snake cannot strike. \nGRACCHUS Lucilla, Gaius is right.  Until the City Guard can neutralize the Praetorians we can accomplish nothing. \nMARCELLUS And I haven't enough men. \nLUCILLA What about the army? \nGAIUS No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years. \nLUCILLA So we do nothing?! \nA door opens, a voice... \nLUCIUS' VOICE Mother... \nAn eight-year-old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy.  He is LUCIUS, Lucilla's son. \nLUCIUS I heard voices... \nLUCILLA (going to him) It's all right, darling, you -- \nLucius suddenly notices Senator Gracchus: \nLUCIUS (running to Gracchus) Senator!  What did you bring me?! \nHe leaps onto Gracchus -- Gracchus laughs and pulls something from his robe. \nGRACCHUS For you prince Lucius... a sea monster! \nGracchus gives Lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea serpent. \nGRACCHUS Off the coast of Achaea they grow twenty times this size, with snapping teeth to devour any nasty Praetorians they come across... now, where is Achaea? \nLUCIUS Below Macedonia! \nGRACCHUS Show me on the map. \nLucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at Achaea.  We sense this is an old game between them. \nLUCILLA Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in shortly. \nLUCIUS (to Gracchus) Thank you, Senator Mountain! \nGRACCHUS You're welcome, Prince Anthill! \nLucius goes.  Lucilla shuts the door after him.  A moment. She turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes. \nLUCILLA What are you going to do? \nGracchus goes to her, holds her. \nGRACCHUS Peace child... One dark night the Gods will light our path.  They will give us the voice we need.  Have faith in that.  Have faith. \nINT./ EXT.  ROMAN STREETS - SLAVE WAGON - NIGHT \nMaximus cranes for a sight of the Eternal City through a hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart. \nHe can see only glimpses of Rome as they pass.  But the images are not what he expected.  Alongside the undeniable glory of the city, the madness and disease Marcus Aurelius spoke of are readily apparent. \nMaximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist Praetorian Guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent architecture of the city -- he sees starving children begging from filthy gutters -- he sees rich citizens out for a stroll -- he sees a swirling combination of sophistication and depravity, of civilization and corruption. \nHe sits back in the cart, deep in thought.  Vibius looks at him. \nVIBIUS Not what you expected? \nMAXIMUS No. \nVIBIUS Rome is nothing but a slaughter house.  And we are the meat. \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nThe slave wagon pulls up to Proximo's rather grand Roman compound.  Guards unlock imposing gates and the wagon drives in... \nEXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT \nInside the gates is a large courtyard, much like Proximo's Moroccan school but much more impressive.  A fountain with an enormous statue of the war god Mars is central in the courtyard. \nThe gladiators climb from the wagon, stretching after the long journey.  Vibius leads Maximus and Juba to the statue.  He wades through the fountain and kisses the toe of Mars. \nVIBIUS Tradition.  He watches over us. \nJuba steps up and kisses the toe. \nVIBIUS (to Maximus) Oh go on, it won't kill you. \n", "test2_true": "PROXIMO (calling to them) Stop that!  You'll get some monstrous disease and then you'll be worth nothing to me! \nGuards come and lead them to their cells, which line one side of the courtyard. \nINT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT \nLater.  Maximus and Juba again share a cell.  It is more comfortable than their cell in Morocco, befitting Maximus' new status as one of the \"stars.\"  A high, barred window on one wall opens to the city.  Another barred window is directly over them, twenty feet above. \nMaximus pulls himself up to the side window, he looks out. \nAnd sees at last... The Colosseum. \nIt is a breathtaking sight.  Monolithic Albert Speer-like columns of light shine up from the Colosseum.  It seems to illuminate the whole city and the heavens above. \nMaximus drops back to the floor. \nJUBA Do you think it will be much different?  Here in Rome? \nMAXIMUS Bigger arena.  Same killing. \nA beat. \nJUBA Are you scared for tomorrow? \nMAXIMUS No. \nA beat. \nJUBA Me too. \nA beat. \nJUBA I never though it would be so easy to kill. \nA beat. \nJUBA So you're finally home. \nMAXIMUS This isn't my home. \nJUBA For all Romans... this is home. \nA beat. \nJUBA (quietly) Among my people we honor the soil of our home.  Our ancestors are in that soil.  All their dreams live there. I will never see my home again.  The soil is dead and no one honors them, so the dreams die. \nA beat. \nMAXIMUS Perhaps one day you'll return. \nJuba looks at him. \nJUBA How can I go back?  I am not what I was.  When a man kills for no reason, he has lost himself. \nA long beat. \nJuba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing.  A haunting lament in his native tongue. \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY \nA flurry of images from around the Colosseum, the energy mounting.  At this point we see practically nothing of the inside of the Colosseum: \nSlaves are balancing high above the empty arena.  They are on ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin; sun tarps that provide shade below... \nMerchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside of the Colosseum.  They sell everything from food to magic elixirs, from toys to aphrodisiacs.  They immediately start declaiming and demonstrating the virtues of their products... \nGangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets.  They have bizarrely-colored hair and elaborate makeup... \nCitizens begin arriving, pushing past the vendors and the pickpockets.  We see whole families with picnic lunches... \nFerocious animals are brought into the Colosseum in barred cages... \nIn the busy arcade, barbers and blood-letters practice their craft alongside exotic alchemists, fire eaters and contortionists... \nRicher citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots, they feign indifference to the hooting mob... \nMounted City Guard police units try to retain some order... \nGamblers crowd betting booths and haggle mercilessly... \nFinally, we see Maximus and the other gladiators in a slave cart.  Maximus watches everything as the slave cart disappears into the Colosseum... \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - ROUTE TO HOLDING CELLS - DAY \nThe interior of the Colosseum is a busy world unto itself. \n", "test2_id": 61, "test3_input": "GAIUS We've been ordered to attend. \nLUCILLA How many are with us? \nGRACCHUS About half.  But once the tyrant is dead.  All. \nA beat. \nGRACCHUS I want to meet him. \nLUCILLA I'll arrange it. \nGAIUS And what of the Emperor? \nA beat. \nLUCILLA He has withdrawn.  He's not eating. He doesn't go out.  He won't even see me... I don't know what tempests rage within him but... \nGRACCHUS We should fear for the blackest storm. \nLUCILLA Yes. \nA beat. \nGAIUS One question... who is to be the actual Regicide? \nA beat.  She glances at him. \nThe drums continue... \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY \nMaximus defeats his opponent.  He stands over him.  He does not kill him. \nHe tosses his sword down and walks away.  The crowd goes crazy, roaring their approval of Maximus. \nSenator Falco, sits in the stands and watches with some alarm.  He glances around as the crowd exalts Maximus.  He is becoming a hero to the people. \nThe drums continue... \nINT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY \nMaximus returns to the holding cells.  Vibius and Juba are waiting. \nVIBIUS You didn't kill him. \nMAXIMUS I will not kill another warrior. There is no honor to it. \nMaximus goes.  Vibius thinks about it, listening to the adulation of the crowd. \nThe drums continue... \nINT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - ROMAN STREETS - DAY \nMaximus and the other gladiators are in a slave cart on the way from the arena.  A gang of children run alongside the cart, cheering and chanting: \nKIDS Maximus the Merciful!  Maximus the Merciful! \nThe drums continue... \nINT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT \nMaximus and Juba are with Lucilla and Gracchus.  Lucilla is writing on a piece of parchment. \nMAXIMUS Tell him we will enter Rome on the first day of Commodus' festival. \nLUCILLA And they will march on Rome for you? \nMAXIMUS Yes.  But this letter must go to the lieutenant named Titus, no one else. \nLUCILLA Captain Marcellus will take it.  And his City Guard will by with you when you get to Rome.  Is that enough to face the Praetorian Guard? \nMAXIMUS (looks to her) The Felix Regiment will never be defeated. \nA beat. \nGRACCHUS I only have one question for you, General... Why? \nA beat. \nGRACCHUS You will lead an army of your brothers on Rome.  Many will die. Why? \nMAXIMUS I want Commodus dead. \nGRACCHUS That's not the reason.  Tell me the truth. \n", "test3_true": "MAXIMUS Because one night an old man whispered to me about a dream.  I will die for that dream. \nA long beat. \nGRACCHUS I knew the old man well.  And I loved him very much.  In our youth we would spend hours building that dream together.  After he went to the wars and lost his way... I was very cruel.  I tormented him to remember that dream we spoke of. \nMAXIMUS He did. \nGRACCHUS You can have no idea how much that means to me. \nA beat. \nGRACCHUS Any man who will die for a whispered dream deserves my respect.  I honor you, General. \nThe drums continue... \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY \nVibius defeats an opponent -- he stands over him.  He looks around at the crowd.  Then he tosses down his sword and walks off. \nThe crowd goes mad with pleasure.  Vibius eats it up, raising his arms and soaking up the applause. \nMaximus watches from the holding cells.  He smiles. \nThe drums continue... \nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT \nProximo supervises as a huge banner is unfurled.  It covers the side of a tall building. \nIt shows a dramatic painting of Maximus. \nProximo supervises happily as torches and braziers are lit to illuminate the mammoth banner. \nThe drums continue... \nEXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY \nThe ending of a group fight -- Proximo's gladiators triumphant. \nThe crowd waits for the delicious act of defiance.  We note many placard and banners honoring \"MAXIMUS THE MERCIFUL.\" \nMaximus, Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators toss down their weapons and walk off, leaving their opponents alive. \nThe crowd roars.  They have completely embraced Maximus and his fellow gladiators. \nGracchus, in the stands, laughs. \nThe drums finally conclude. \nINT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBER - DAY \nLucilla is with her HANDMAIDEN.  They sit before a large mirror, the Handmaiden perfecting Lucilla's makeup for the day. \nOne of Commodus' Centurion Body Guards enters, bows. \nCENTURION Madame, the Emperor would like to see you. \nLucilla quickly glances to her Handmaiden in the mirror and then braces herself, stands, and quickly leaves with the Centurion. \nINT.  PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY \nLucilla strides quickly, nervously, down the long corridor to Commodus' chambers.  She enters... \nINT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - DAY \nCommodus is wrapped in a sheet, gazing out a window. \nLUCILLA Caesar... \nHe turns.  She stops. \nHe looks as if he has not slept for days.  If a word could now sum up his clouded face it is this:  tormented. \nShe goes to him, embraces him.  He holds her tightly. \nCOMMODUS I am sorry to have kept you away... I needed this time to think... \nLUCILLA Of course... \nHe moves away from her, slowly moving around the room. \nCOMMODUS I limited my world to these four walls so as to let my mind free... again and again my mind settles on but one question... What kind of world are we making when the people of Rome prefer a slave in the arena to their father? \nA beat.  Commodus' strange philosophical bent is unnerving Lucilla. \n", "test3_id": 62}

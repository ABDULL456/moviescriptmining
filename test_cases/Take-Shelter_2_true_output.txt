Hannah lies flat as the sled moves her through the oval CT scanner. A red, lighted crosshair passes over her face. 
INT. OTOLARYNGOLOGIST'S CLINIC/OFFICE - DAY 
Samantha has Hannah on her lap. She and Curtis listen intently to an ATTENDANT who sits next to them with a file. 
ATTENDANT Since the doctor's approved her for surgery, We just need to get her scheduled. The next possible opening is... (reviews a calendar) The 21st of next month. That's six weeks. 
CURTIS Six weeks? 
ATTENDANT Is that okay? 
SAMANTHA It's wonderful. 
EXT. PUMP STATION CONSTRUCTION SITE/FARMLAND - DAY 
Curtis stands with Russell over the hood of a pick-up truck. They look over a roll of ground water charts. Russell talks and points to the map, but Curtis' attention is focused elsewhere. He watches Dewart in the distance. 
RUSSELL ...this point just to the west. I don't think we'll have any problem. We should be able to get twenty, maybe thirty in this next week. But we're looking to see how that's gonna shape up, so... Dewart smiles and makes broad gestures with his arms. He's telling a story to Dave, who laughs hard. 
RUSSELL (CONT'D) Curtis? His attention snaps back. 
CURTIS Yeah. 
RUSSELL What do you think? 
CURTIS Yeah. That sounds good. We'll get it done. Russell rolls up the charts. They walk toward the work site, toward Dewart. 
INT. DELTA AGRI-PRO MAIN OFFICE/JIM'S OFFICE - DAY 
Jim fills out paperwork at his desk. There is a KNOCK. 
JIM Come in. Curtis walks inside. He stands in front of the desk. 
JIM (CONT'D) What you need Curtis? 
CURTIS I need a favor Jim. 
JIM What's that? 
CURTIS Can you take Dewart off my crew? Just reassign him someplace else. Jim sets his pen down and leans back. 
JIM What's the trouble? He not pullin' his weight? 
CURTIS No, nothin' like that. He's a good worker. He's a good man. He's my friend. I think it'd be easier not being in charge of someone I'm so close to. Jim nods. 
JIM You know, I understand. This is part of what it means to manage people Curtis. You're gonna have to learn that.

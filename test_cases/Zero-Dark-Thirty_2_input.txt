INT./EXT. PRINCE 52 - CONTINUOUS 
The second helo passes over but a storm of debris and garbage from the rooftop creates another flight risk and the helo banks away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COMPOUND - FIRST GATE 
Patrick, Justin and SIX other SEALs cluster near the First Gate in the animal pen. One of the SEALs places a charge on the gate, while others check the Prayer Room. Boom! The charge partially blows open the metal swing doors of the gate, leaving a very narrow gap. Not ideal. The SEALs muscle and squeeze their way through the narrow opening in the jagged metal as the SNIPER climbs up on the roof of the prayer room. 
EXT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 
Patrick and Jared arrive at the guest house but can't see inside - the windows and doors are covered with sheets. Patrick kneels down to place a charge at the front door handle when the door erupts with gunfire - Bullets fly out of the wooden door. One skims Patrick's shoulder as he kneels lower. Patrick fires back at the house, putting a dozen rounds inside. A moment passes. They wait for a response. The door handle unlocks. ABU AHMED'S WIFE appears at the doorway and walks out. 
JARED Ir-fah ee-dek! 
ABU AHMED'S WIFE 
(IN ENGLISH) You killed him. 
INT. GUEST HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
The SEALs peer inside and see ABU AHMED lying dead in a pool of blood. Patrick and Jared pump safety rounds into the body. FOUR KIDS are cowering in the corner. Jared moves them out of the house. 
EXT. COMPOUND - DIEGO CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
The rest of the P51 SEALS breach a gate to the courtyard of the Main House. The gate flies open in a fiery ball. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COMPOUND WALLS OUTSIDE MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS 
SEALs jump out of P52, rush to the outer wall and set breaching charges on a gate... While Hakim, the DOG HANDLER, and another SEAL peel off down the block Saber and his team stand by as BOOM!!!, The gate charges go off...only to reveal a BRICK WALL behind the gate. 
SABER That's not a door. 
SEAL Failed breach. They hustle to the next entry way and prepare another breach 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN HOUSE - COURTYARD 
The COMMANDING OFFICER hears that the SEALs outside are preparing a charge. SEAL MIKE radios in 
SEAL MIKE (O.S.) 
(INTO RADIO) This is Echo 11, we're going to breach the main gate. 
COMMANDING OFFICER 
(INTO RADIO) Negative. I'm internal, I'll let you in. The Commanding Officer opens the gate and the other SEALs walk inside. As a group, they move towards the main house, arriving at the South side front door. The door is open and they enter - 
INT. MAIN HOUSE FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
Piercing the first floor darkness with their infra red lights, the SEALs advance slowly into the first floor hallway. Piles of household clutter, stacked high in bizarre shapes, greet them like the innards of a haunted house. One of the SEAL's catches movement: A figure with an AK-47 scrambling through clutter, then disappearing around a corner. 
JUSTIN Abrar! The figure, Abu Ahmed's brother, ABRAR, re-appears at the end of the hallway. He pokes his head out - 
- And is shot by Justin. He falls out of view, whimpering in pain. 
INT. MAIN HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

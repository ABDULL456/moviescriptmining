DELILAH He isn't `my God'.   He's everybody's God. 
He looks at his wife- 
TY How that tent meeting went tonight? 
DELILAH Viola Underwood found the Lord. 
TY I thought she found Him last year when they come through. 
DELILAH (smiles) Well, she must have lost Him again between then and now, cause she come down that aisle tonight hollering in tongues. 
TY The Spirit didn't move you, though? 
DELILAH (thoughtful) Not yet.   Might be too late for me. 
Delilah surveys the room- 
DELILAH I can't believe you're serving Alton Stokely. 
STOKELY 
Stokely has to use two hands to keeps his glass steady as he drinks- 
DELILAH (O.S.) That poor man- 
TY (O.S.) Toussaint cut his credit off. Either he gets it here- 
TY AND DELILAH 
TY -or he drinks that paint-peeler Willie Pettigrew cooks up back in the swamp. 
DELILAH He's gonna drink himself to death in here. 
TY Least he won't go blind first. 
Delilah shakes her head and heads out the door- 
DELILAH Imonna go home and say a prayer for that man. 
TY (calling after)   Say one for me too, baby. 
STAGE 
Bertha Mae is singing straight to Slick now, as Metalmouth backs her up on the harmonica- 
BERTHA MAE Come here sweet Poppa Let me whisper in your ear Come here sweet Poppa Let me whisper in your ear Go back to Alabama But don't you leave your Momma here 
Only Slick applauds- 
SLICK That was outstandin, baby.   You still got the voice. 
Bertha Mae, a little unsteady, holds onto Slick's arm as he helps her off the stage- 
BERTHA MAE You think so? 
SLICK Sent a chill down my spine to hear you. 
Bertha Mae looks to Ty as he steps back in- 
BERTHA MAE I might be a little late Saturday, Tyrone. 
TY (mutters, embarrassed) Don't need to come in if you don't want to. 
She stops dead.   Stares at him till he has to let it out- 
TY I've made other arrangements. 
BERTHA MAE Other arrangements- 
TY Try something new in here. 
SLICK You can't do that! 
BERTHA MAE It's his place, darlin, he can do whatever he want. 
Bertha Mae nods to Ty, holding onto her dignity for all it's worth-

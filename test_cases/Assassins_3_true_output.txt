Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's .22. 
Bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door. 
Inside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out the door.  It spins over the balcony and plummets to the ground and bursts open. 
A GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest in the middle of the courtyard. 
Rath and Bain both see it. 
Staying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it. 
Bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then back at the door.  Something's got to give. 
Unsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door. 
Bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502. 
Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra.  He takes a slow breath and tears from the shadows -- 
Bolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip, the ground a blur beneath him -- 
Bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath. 
Two more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip as -- 
The RIFLE SPITS -- 
Rath screams, his leg erupting with blood. 
TELESCOPIC SIGHT 
The scope glides up zeroing the back of Rath's head. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Rath rams the clip in place. 
BAIN Game -- 
Bain squeezes the trigger -- 
CLICK -- the rifle is empty.  Bain screams in disbelief. 
Rolling over, Rath jacks back the slide and sights the balcony but Bain is gone. 
Electra searches the room for a way out.  Keeping the gun trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole that Bain fell through. 
Grimacing, Rath struggles to his feet. 
RATH Electra! 
Bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster flying. 
Electra spins to shoot but the FLOOR suddenly CRACKS OPEN, swallowing her. 
Limping, lurching up the stairs, Rath hears the CRASH. 
Jarred by the fall, Electra drags herself away from the open ceiling. 
RATH The gun!  He needs the gun!  Get rid of it!  Throw it! 
She looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared.  She looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands. 
His leg soaked with blood, Rath rumbles down the hall. 
Black with soot, Bain descends soundless, serpent-like to the fourth level through another burned opening. 
Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at every dark corner.  She is almost there when we see Bain, a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her. 
Lumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the door to room 502. 
Hearing Bain, Electra turns.  In one smooth motion, he snatches her arm and breaks her wrist.  The gun falls. 
Rath hears her scream. 
Electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her to the ground. 
She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face, jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious. 
Bain grabs the gun. 
Rath whips into the room BLASTING -- 
BULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened hole. 
Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead. Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared with blood. 
From within the labyrinth, Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH. 
BAIN (O.S.) Hey!  Tell me something, Bobby-boy. 
Electra comes to, her eyes blinking open. 
BAIN (O.S.) Are you still thinking that you're going to take me? 
Electra is trying to focus, as Rath listens to the voice, searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from everywhere. 
BAIN (O.S.) No, I don't think you are.  You know what I think? 
The voice is closer.  Rath wipes the stinging sweat from his eyes.

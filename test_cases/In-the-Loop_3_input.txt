TOBY Yeah, alright. 
SUZY Oh and be careful - cars! 
They walk off in separate directions. 
9   MORNING/INT. MICHAEL'S FO OFFICE - MORNING                        9 
Toby is walking towards DFID. As he nears the building he finds himself next to Malcolm, who is heading in too. Toby is on the phone. 
INTERCUT PHONE CALL: 
TOBY Are you going to keep ringing me up every two minutes, because you're starting to remind me of my mum. And that could lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction. 
Suzy is still in the FO office.

SUZY I'm just checking whether you put last night's lasagne in the fridge. 
In the FO office, MICHAEL arrives. He has a small suitcase and a paper bag. He holds this up. 
MICHAEL (mouthing) Croissants! 
Back with Malcolm, Toby close by. Malc's on the phone. 
MALCOLM No. You're fine to go ahead and print that. It's lies, you'd be lying, but go ahead. He did not say unforeseeable. No he did not. Oh, just before you go -- when I tell your wife about you and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conference...would email be better? Or a phone call? Or, hey I know, I'll write it on a cake, "Your hack husband betrayed you on the 4th of October, and congratulations on the new baby" in those little silver balls. (BEAT) Yeah, maybe best to spike it? Okay. Fuckity-bye! 
Toby is now next to Malcolm in the building (or better still, in a lift). Malcolm becomes aware of him. 
TOBY No, it's fine, it's in the fridge. I put some clingfilm over it. In the FO office, Michael switches on some classical music. 
SUZY Why did you put clingfilm on it? 
TOBY To keep it fresh. 
Malcolm starts dialling on his phone. 
SUZY It's in the fridge, that'll keep it fresh. 
TOBY No, but it still might dry out. 
MALCOLM (into phone) Yeah, Malcolm Tucker. Can I speak to James Lewis at the PM Programme please? Page 7 
9    CON TINUE D: (2)                                            9 
Michael hands Suzie a croissant. 
MICHAEL (knowing Toby is on the other end of the line) Still slightly warm. That's how I like my women as well. 
SUZY Clingfilm is carcinogenic, Toby. 
TOBY No it isn't. That's a myth. Clingfilm is perfectly safe. 
Malcolm now eyeing Toby with suspicion/contempt -- who is this dick? Toby tries to smile, lowers his voice, embarrassed. 
MALCOLM (into phone) No, I'll hold,. what's he waiting for?     A sex-change? 
TOBY They wouldn't sell clingfilm if it gave you cancer. Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer. And Lasagne doesn't give you syphillis. 
MALCOLM James! Right --Simon Foster? Yeah, very funny, the Diarrhoea of a Nobody. Listen, we get an easy ride on Tom tomorrow, OK? (getting annoyed) No, YOU relax. Tell you what, I'll come over a lock you in a flotation tank and pump it full of sewage until you drown. GET ME FUCKING BRIAN!

Judy gets a call. 
JUDY Hi. Right. I see.

JUDY Malcolm's coming to see you.

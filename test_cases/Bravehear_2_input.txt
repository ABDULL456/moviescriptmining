HAMISH With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm! 
WILLIAM It's up to us, Hamish! 
Hamish leans forward for a look, but William pulls him back. 
WILLIAM Not yet! Here he comes, be ready! 
They wait; heavy FOOTSTEPS. Then from around the edge of the grove three enormous, ugly hogs appear. The boys hurling rotten eggs. The eggs slap the snouts of the pigs, who scatter as the boys charge, howling. We PULL BACK... as the sun goes down on their play. 
EXT. THE WALLACE HOUSE - SUNDOWN 
The boys walk toward the house, beneath a lavender sky. 
HAMISH Wanna stay with me tonight? 
WILLIAM I wanna have supper waitin'. 
HAMISH We'll get those English pigs tomorrow. 
WILLIAM Aye, we'll get 'em. 
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 
William's face appears at the window, looking toward 
THE DISTANT HILLS 
of trees and heather, where there is no sign of life. 
INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 
William has cooked stew in a pot, and now spoons up two steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table. But he is only hoping. He looks out the window again; he is still all alone. So he leaves a candle burning on the table beside the stew, and moves up the stairs. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN 
The house is silent, fog rolling around it in the dawn. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN 
William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. He rises, and in QUICK CUTS: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed bed. He moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, also unrumpled. 
IN THE KITCHEN 
He finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted candle. He spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone. 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
William is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the hogs, while he glimpses something coming. 
THE BOY'S POV 
An ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers glance up at William, their faces grim... 
From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact. 
CAMPBELL William... Come down here, lad. 
William looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... but the bodies are still there. 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
It's now surrounded by horses, wagons, and neighbors. The undertaker arrives in his hearse. 
INT. THE SHED - DAY 
On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes. 
Softly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work. 
William approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood. 
The undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the blood. But the wounds remain. 
EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY 
CLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy, standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken. 
The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin.

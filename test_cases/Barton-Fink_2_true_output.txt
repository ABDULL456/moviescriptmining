With this the woman's voice stops, and Mayhew starts wailing again. 
The door cracks open. 
The woman looks as if she has been crying. 
WOMAN ...Can I help you? 
BARTON I'm sorry, I... My name is Fink... Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this afternoon.  Is he in? 
WOMAN Mr. Mayhew is indisposed at the moment 
From inside, we hear Mayhew's wail. 
MAYHEW HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!! 
The woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps outside, closing the door behind her. 
WOMAN Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor, Mr. Mayhew's personal secretary. I know this all must sound horrid. I really do apologize... 
Through the door Mayhew is still wailing piteously. 
BARTON Is, uh... Is he okay? 
AUDREY He will be... When he can't write, he drinks. 
MAYHEW WHERE ARE YOU, DAMMIT! WHERE'S M'HONEY!! 
She brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes. 
AUDREY I am sorry, it's so embarassing. 
BARTON How about you? Will you be alright? 
AUDREY I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink? 
BARTON Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton. 
Audrey reaches out and touches Barton's hand. 
AUDREY I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment. 
BARTON Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town. 
Audrey smiles at him. 
AUDREY Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink. 
BARTON Please, Barton. 
AUDREY Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We- 
MAYHEW'S VOICE M'HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!! 
Audrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes and heavy footsteps. 
BARTON I see. 
AUDREY ...I know this must look... funny. 
BARTON No, no  
Hurriedly: 
AUDREY We need each other. We give each other...  the things we need  
VOICE M'HONEY!!... bastard-ass sons of bitches... the water's lappin' up... M'HONEY!! 
AUDREY I'm sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don't judge us. Please... 
Flustered, she backs away and closes the door. 
CLOSE ON A SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGE 
Hand-printed on the package is the message: 
"Hope these will turn the trick, Mr. Fink.  Chet!" 
The wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened. 
Two thumbtacks are taken out. 
BARTON'S HOTEL ROOM 
Late at night. The swath of wallpaper behind the bed has sagged away from the wall again, and has been joined by the swath next to it. 
Barton enters frame and steps up onto the bed. 
He smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near the top. 
EXTREME CLOSE SHOT 
On the tack. As Barton applies pressure to push it in, tacky yellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads around the tack.

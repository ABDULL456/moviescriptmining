SNAKE We've got to get to the President NOW, while he's busy. 
BRAIN Forget it, he's on the other side of town and we got no wheels.  The deal is off -- 
SNAKE Just calm down. 
EXT. CAR -- NIGHT A lone man sits, looking bored.  Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him out, and gets him out of the car.  He briefly considers shooting the guy on the hood of the car.  Instead, the guy on the hood of the car walks around.  Snake knocks him out a second alter and then drives to get Brain and Maggie.  He knocks the other guy out of the car. 
BRAIN (panicked) I think they saw us!  Turn left, turn left here! 
INT. CAR -- NIGHT 
MAGGIE Brain, this is Broadway. 
BRAIN I know, I know, the Duke'll take Seventh Avenue, Broadway is five minutes -- 
MAGGIE No!!! 
BRAIN Yes!!!  Just keep driving! 
SNAKE What's wrong with Broadway? 
EXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT 
SNAKE (to the car) Come on sweetheart . . . 
People start throwing bricks.  Snake hands his gun to Brain, who passes it to Maggie, holding it like a dead rat (or like a macho guy would hold a purse).  Snake drives as fast as he can, gunning off the bystander who gets on the car.  A bystander grabs Brain. 
BRAIN Maggie! 
Maggie protects him.  She shoots the people grabbing at him.  Snake angles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away.  He glares at Brain.  Everyone seems visibly shaken. 
SNAKE Hold on. 
Snake backs the car through a bunch of piled cars.  He takes off, the car a bit worse for wear but at least they got away from the crowd on Broadway. 
EXT. TRAINS -- NIGHT Brain points to the cars as Snake watches. 
BRAIN He'll be in the third car from the end, by the last campfire.

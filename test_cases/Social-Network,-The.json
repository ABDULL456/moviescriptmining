Did you know there are more people with genius IQ's living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States? \nERICA (V.O. ) That can't be true. \nMARK (V.O.) it is true. \nERICA (V.O.) What would account for that? \nMARK (V.0.) Well first of all, a lot of people live in China. But here's my question: \nFADE IN \nINT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT \nMARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you or to himself. \nERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested. \nThe scene is stark and simple. \nMARK How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's? \nERICA I didn't know they take SAT's in China. \nMARK I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about here. \nERICA You got 1600? \nMARK You can sing in an a Capella group. \nBRICA Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong? \nMARK Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar PC. \nERICA Or you get into a final club. \nMARK Or you get into a final club, exactly. \nERICA I like guys who row crew. \nMARK \n(BEAT) Well I can't do that. And yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the test. \nERICA Have you ever tried? \nMARK I'm trying now. \nERICA To row crew? \nMARK To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like--whatever--crazy? \nERICA Sometimes, Mark-seriously-YOU say two things at once and I'm not sure which one we're talking about. \nMARK But you've seen guys who row crew, right? \nERICA No. \nMARK Okay, well.. they're bigger than me. They're world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you'd met one. \nERICA I guess I meant I liked the idea of it. The way a girl likes cowboys. \nMARK The Phoenix is good. \nERICA This is a new topic? \nMARK It's the same topic. \nERICA We're still talking about the finals clubs? \nMARK Would you rather talk about something else? \nERICA It's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have had a birthday. \nMARK We can change the subject. \nERICA. (can't get over it) There are more people in China with genius IQ's than the entire population of-- \nMARK It's about exclusivity. \nT'RICA .....what is? \nMARK The final clubs. And that's how you distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc. \nERICA Which one? \nMARK The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best. \nERICA I actually meant which Roosevelt. \nMARK Theodore. \nERICA Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into? \nMARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag and blows the smoke out before he says... \nMARK Hm. \nERICA What? \nMARK why would you ask me that? \nERICA I was just asking. \nMARK They're all hard to get into. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil futures last summer and he won't get in. Money or the ability to make it doesn't impress anybody around here. Everybody can do that. \nERICA He made $300,000 in a summer? \nMARK He likes meteorology. \nERICA You said it was oil futures. \nMARK If you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. You asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance, \nERICA \nEDUARDO \n(HEAT) You think that's such a good idea? \nMARY What's the algozithm? \nCUT TO: \nINT.

And while it may take us a while to notice it, MARK's a different person in these flash-forward scenes. Still tortured and complicated, but comfortable now with his own power. His lawyer is SY, who's accompanied by some junior associates, one of whom--a pleasant, pretty and professional young contemporary of Mark's named MARYLIN, we'll get to know. On the other side are EDUARDO and his lawyer, GRETCHEN, also a. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 mpanied by some associates. A STENOGRAPHER is typing the recor..

People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly. MARK stays in his seat.

They know that the others aren't in their class and even though they're highly competitive athletes, they don't like showing anyone up, least of all their teammates. \nCAMERON Is there anyway to make this a fair fight? \nTYLER We could jump out and swim. \nCAMERON I think we'd have to jump out and drown. \nTYLER I'm not willing to do that. \nCAMERON What are we at three-quarter power? Let's drop down to a half. \nTYLER Or you could row forward and I could row backward. \nCAMERON I'd kick your ass. \nTYLER We're genetically identical, so biology and mathematics says we'd stay in one place not allowing for the current or the wind. \nCAMERON Just row the boat. \nAnd the WINI{LEVOSS twins kick into full gear and open up an even wider lead as we. \nCUT.

I'm asking how do you want to do it? \nEDUARDO Advertising. \nMARK No. What were their names? \nEDUARDO We've got 4000 members. \nMARK 'Cause theFacebook is cool. If we start installing pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's \nNOT GONNA-- \nEDUARDO Well I wasn't thinking it would be Mountain Dew but at some point--and I'm speaking as the business end of the \nCOMPANY--THE SITE-- \nMARK We don't even know what it is yet. We don't know what it is, what it can be, what it will be. We know it'\u00e2\u0080\u00a2s cool, that's a -priceless asset and we're not giving it up. EDUARDO is sitting at MARK's desk and he's seen something sitting on top of a pile of'books.,, \nEDUARDO Mark, what is this? \nMARK What, EDUARDO holds up a letter that's on a lawyer's stationary. \nEDUARDO This, \nMARK I think it's called a cease and desist letter. What were their names? \nEDUARDO Who? \nMARX The girls. EDUARDO's speed reading the letter. \nEDUARDO When did you get this? \nMARK About 10 days ago. Right after we launched the site. \nEDUARDO Jesus Christ. \nMARK I liked th shorter one. \nEDUARDO They're saying--the Winklevoss twins are saying you stole their idea. \nMARK I find that to be mildly annoying. \nEDUARDO They find it to be property theft.

They must feel they have some grounds for-- \nMARK The lawyer is their father's house counsel, I checked it out, they're not, \nYOU KNOW--- \nEDUARDO Do they have grounds? \nMARK Yes, the grounds are theFacebook is cool. and popular and sexy and HarvardConnection is lame. I didn't use any of their code, I didn't use anything. A guy who builds a really nice chair doesn.'t owe money to everyone who,,, ever built a chair. Th ey came to me with an idea, I had a better one. \nEDUARDO Why didn't you show me the letter? \nMARK I didn't think. it was a big deal.. \nEDUARDO If there's' something wrong--if there's ever anything wrong--you can tell me.

MARK can't help a smile. Then he sees something... \nMARK I'll be right back. \nEDUARDO Where you going? \nMARK makes his way through the crowd toward a round booth. A girl is sitting there and even though her back is to MARK he can recognize her. She's with a girlfriend and three guys. When he makes it to the booth he says-- \nMARK Erica? ERICA, from the opening scene, turns her head and looks up to see MARK. She's looking sexy for her Friday ni.ght on the town and the three guys she's with are studs. A few more friends of theirs are standing around at the edges of the booth. \nERICA \n(PAUSE) Hi Mark. \nMARK I saw you from over there. I didn't know you came to this club a lot. \nERICA It's my first time. \nMARK Mine too. It's not bad. It's not. great. The music's kind of lame. Could I talk to you alone for a second? \nERICA I think I'm good right here. \nMARK okay. MARK is aware of everyone else around the booth. \nMARK (CONT'D) \n(BEAT) I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched. \nERICA No. \nMARK ThePacebook? \nERICA You called me a bitch on the internet, Mark. \nMARK I'm really sorry about that. \nERICA On the internet. \nMARK That's why I came over. \nERICA comparing women to farm animals? \nMARX I didn't end up doing that. \nERICA It didn't stop you from writing it. As if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever it would be a crime for it not to be published. The internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch. \n(BEAT) Right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, published my bra size and then rated women-based on their hotness. Why don't you say it to me now, why don't say it to my face? \nMARK I don't want to. \nREGGIE (A FRIEND OF ERICA'S) Erica, is there a problem? \nERICA No, there's no problem. \n(PAUSE) You're not a real person, Mark. You write your bullshit from a dark room because you're a failure at human contact. I liked you and I was nice to you. \nMARK \n(PAUSE) I came over to say I was sorry for all that and to see if there was any chance-- \nERICA I don't want to be rude to my fxiends, I should be talking to them. \nMARK Okay. \nERICA Hey Mark. A year from now you won't remember this conversation and you won't remember me. \nMARK I think you're wrong. \nERICA Well... listen, good luck with your video game. It was an honest mistake on ERICA's part but a kidney punch to \nMARK. \nMARK \n(BEAT) Okay. MARK turns and goes and sees that EDUARDO has been standing at and watching from a distance with JENNY. \nEDUARDO That was cool, you did good. You talked to her, that was the right thing to do. \n(BEAT) It was good, Mark. \nMARK \n(IGNORING HIM) We have to expand. \nEDUARDO (over the music) What? \nMARK We have to expand.

Chris, you're going to be in charge. of publicity and outreach. You can start by getting a story about the expansion in the B.U. student newspaper. \nCHRIS They hate doing stories about Harvard. \nMARK - Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major and they will have heard of me. Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programming for theno . \nEDUARDO Why do you want a story in the B.U.--- \nMARK Because I do. Here's the business arrangement. Eduardo's CFO and owns 30% of the company, Dustin's Vice President and Head of Programming and his 5% of the company will come from my end. Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing.

He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland and the closest we've come to talking face to face is when I saw him on. the quad and chased him through Harvard Square. \nSUMMERS You chased him? \nCAMERON \n(BEAT) I saw him and I know he saw me and I started after him and he disappeared \nSUMMERS You know he could have you arrested for harassment and attempted assault. \nTYLER \n(QUIETLY) This isn't happening. \nSUMMERS I don't see this as a University issue. \nTYLER Of course it's a University issue. There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both. \nSUMMERS You entered into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other. \nTYLER \n(BEAT) I'm sorry President Summers, what you just said makes no sense to me at all. \nSUMMERS I'm devastated by that. \nCAMERON What my brother means is that if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer it would be a university issue, right? \nSUMMERS I really don't know. This office doesn't handle petty larceny and the only reason I agreed to see you--Anne; by did I agree to see them? \nANNE Colleagues of their father. \nSUMMERS So you see? \nTYLER This isn't a petty larceny. \nCAMERON \n(CALMING) \nTY-- \nTYLER This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars. \nSUMMERS Millions of dollars? \nCAMERON Yes. \nSUMMERS You might be letting your imagination run away with you. \nTYLER With all due respect I don't think you're in any position to make that call. \nSUMMERS I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in some position to make that call. \nTYLER Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshmen address. \nSUMMERS Well. I would try letting your- imaginations run away with you on a new project. \nTYLER You would. \nSUMMERS Everyone at Harvard is inventing something or starting a new business in their dorm room- Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than getting one so can I suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project? \nCAMERON I'm sorry, but that-'s not the point, sir. \nSUMMERS What's the point? \nCAMERON You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand-the, difference between right and wrong. \nSUMMERS And you're saying that I don't? \nCAMERON Of course I'm not saying that. \nTYLER I'm saying that. SUMMERS looks at TYLER and then smiles... \nTYLER (CONT'D) Just start another project? Like we're making a diorama for the science fair? \nSUMMERS Yes. And if you have a goddam problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss, the courts are always at your disposal. Athletes don't get special treatment at this school. \nTYLER Do they get fairness? \nSUMMERS They don't get to run to daddy. Okay? This isn't 50 years ago. \nTYLER Excuse me, sir, but in your analogy, is daddy our father or you? \nSUMMERS Both.

Who the hell is this? \nEDUARDO (GONT'D) (quiet] ) . Take your time... \nJENNY Stop it. SEAN makes his way'over to MARK's table-- \nSEAN I'm Sean Parker. \nEDU.ARDO \n(SHAKING HANDS) How do you do. \nSEAN You must be Eduardo, And Jenny.

He took us through his episode with Napster . \nSEAN . tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties and in the end we just had to declare bankruptcy but I made a name for myself. \nJENNY I'll say. EDUARDO (V.o.) And then he went to his second business venture which was Plaxo, an online rolodex. \nSEAN See, we had a VC from the beginning. Michael Moritz, a partner at Sequoia Capital who'd invested in Yahoo and Google. Moritz wanted to push me out from \nTHE BE ginning and he hired private detectives to dig up everything on me they could. Did they find anything? No. But I was out of the company. I'm not done with Moritz and Sequoia Capital yet. I swear to God, Mark, before I'm 25 I'm gonna make those guys kiss my ass and then cry like girls, There will be retribution for Plaxo and I'm not just talking. I brought down the record companies with Napster and I'll bring down Michael Moritz, \nE DUARDO You didn't bring down the record companies, They won. \nSEAN In court. \n.EDUARDO \n(BEAT) Yes. \nSEAN (shrugging it off) Well. \nEDUARDO (V.O.)

For instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but Baylor already had a social network on campus so instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within a hundred miles and put theFacebook on those campuses first. Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were seeing their friends on our site and we were in. \nSEAN Perfect. \nEDAURDO Thank you, it was mine. \nJENNY \n(TO EDUARDO) Easy. \nEDUARDO Settle an argument for us, would you? I say it's time to start making money from theFacebook but Mark doesn't want advertising. Who's right? \nSEAN Neither of you. TheFacebook is cool, that's what it's got going for it. \nMART Yes. \nSEAN You don't want to ruin it with ads because ads aren't cool. \nMARK Exactly. \nSEAN it's like you're throwing the coolest party on campus and someone's telling you it's gotta be over at 11:00. \nMARY, Exactly. \nSEAN You don't even know what the thing is y\u00e2\u0082\u00act. \nMARK I said exactly that. \nSEAN Row big it can get and how far it can go. Picture sharing, news feeds, a virtual champagne room, apps you haven't even thought of. This.is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? \nEDUARDO You? \nSEAN A billion dollars. And that's where you're headed. A billion dollar valuation. Unless you take bad advice in which case you might as well have come up with a chain of very successful dry cleaners. When you go fishing you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

It's better to be accused of armed robbery. I'm going to have to explain this to my father, I'm going to have to explain this to everyone, I'm going to have to--what is happening on that? EDUARDO's referring to a laptop that's open and displaying images of four paintings. \nMARK T. have my final coming up for \"Postwar and Contemporary Art\" and I haven't been to class.

You can use a CD. \nASHLEIGH Do it off this. ASHLEIGH's sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top so that she's in just a bra. She's offering her chest as a surface off of which to snort cocaine. \nGIRL Alright! The GIRL taps out some coke from a vial onto ASHLEIGH's chest and starts passing around a rolled up 20-dollar bill for everyone to have a turn and she herself will unbutton her shirt too for the same purpose. All this while SEAN is talking, \nSEAN The next transformative development? A picture sharing application. A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life. It is the true... digitalization of real life. You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you could tag anyone you wanted in those pictures so that people could find themselves. Then a digital log of every change in a person's life, broadcast to all their friends instantaneously. \nASHLEIGH Would this be easier without the bra? \nGUY It's worth finding out. The girls start happily slipping off their bras-- \n.SEAN I've spent hours-- \nASHLEIGH Why has the music stopped? \nSEAN I've spent hours watching what people do when they log on. \nASHLEIGH Seriously, why has the music stopped? ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the addle of SEAN's speech and the sound outside from the party just doesn't sound like a party anymore. \nSEAN flow they always checked their friends' status updates, checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles, changed their photos and mostly...We lived on farms, then we lived in cities and now we're gonna live on the internet. \n- ASHLEIGH Sean.

They turn to see TWO POLICEMEN standing in the doorway, their flashlights scanning the room and hitting SEAN's eyes. \nSEAN \n(BEAT) We're sorry, was the music too loud? We've got kind of a celebration going. \nPOLICEMAN Ladies, I need you to put your shirts on. \nSEAN I can have them turn the music down. One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The cop uses his finger to taste what it is. \nSEAN (CONT'D) Yeah, that isn't mine. \nPOLICEMAN Okay, could you all stay where you are. And the handcuffs start to come out and we've got a room of terrified children. \nGIRL, Wait, can we just talk for a second?

FINAL CLUB - NIGHT \nWe'll be cutting back here a lot in this sequence, with the Paul Young song tying them together, as we show---mostly MOS--- preparations under way for the hottest party on campus tonight. We start on a good looking STUDENT fixing his tie in the bathroom mirror. He walks out of the bathroom and into the main area where he's immediately tossed a bottle of champagne by a similarly dressed STUDENT. We see that there are a couple of dozen other guys around. Our guy takes the champagne bottle and sticks it on the bar, which is being stocked by two sexy FEMALE uniformed BARTENDERS. Our guy walks past P. DJ's table where the DJ is setting up his incredibly high-end equipment. Our guy trots down a set of mahogany and red-carpet stairs, opens a heavy door and looks out to the sidewalk. \nA BOUNCER in a tuxedo is standing by a velvet rope which is holding back three dozen STUDENTS.

They take in some of the photographs around the room---SUMMERS with BILL CtINTON, etc. \n-SUMMERS (CONT'D) \n(INTO PHONE) Catherine, I have students in my office now. \n(INTO PHONE) Students. \n(INTO PHONE) Under. grads. \n(INTO PHONE) I don't know, from the looks of it I think they want to sell me sets of identical Brooks Brothers suits. We'll speak later. SUMMERS hangs up the phone-- \nSUMMERS (CONT'D) Good morning. \nCAMERON Good morning, s_ir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler. CAMERON is extending his hand but instead of taking it, SUMMERS reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten- page letter off the top. \nSUMMERS Why are you here? There's silence while SUMMERS appears to read over the letter... \nSUMMERS (CONT'D) That wasn't rhetorical. \nCAMERON I'm sorry, I thought you were reading the letter. \nSUMMERS I've read the letter. \nCAMERON Well I think it's pretty self- explanatory. We had an idea for a website called HarvardConnection--we've since changed the name to ConnectU--and Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and-- \nSUMMERS What do you want me to do about it? CAMERON points to a row of Harvard Student Handbooks on the bookshelf behind SUMMERS. \nCAMERON V Well sir, in The Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman--under the heading \"Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community\" and the sub-heading, \"Honesty\"-- \nSUMMERS Oh dear God. \nCAMERON --it says, \"The College expects that all students will be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members of this community. All students are required to respect private and public ownership. Instances of theft, misappropriation or unauthorized use of or damage to property \nOR MATERIALS-- \nSUMMERS Excuse me, Anne? \nANNE Yes sir., \nSUMMERS Punch me in the face. (beat--then to CAMERON) Go ahead-. \nCAMERON \n(BEAT) --will result in disciplinary action, including the requirement to withdraw from the College.\" That's what is says in the handbook. \nSUMMERS When did you memorize that? \n", "test2_id": 949, "test3_input": "DUSTIN \n(SHOUTING INSIDE) Andrew! Get the door! \nMARY. He's wired in. MARK walks into-- \nINT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nThe place is computer geek paradise. Computers are everywhere, along with some of the empty boxes they came in. Pizza boxes, Chinese food containers, empty beer bottles and white boards filled with indecipherable code fill the room. There are a couple of large mattresses on the floor and a large map of the U.S. with pins and tags showing the schools where they've already put Facebook and different pins showing the schools they're going for. As MARK walks to the door, he walks past ANDREW, who's sitting at a computer, writing code and completely oblivious to everything around him. \nMARK (snapping his fingers) Andrew. \nANDREW Not now. \nMARK Good boy. MARK gets to the door and opens it. He's stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his girlfriend, SHARON. They all look at each other for a moment--- \nSEAN Mark? \nMARK Sean? \nSEAN Do you live here? \nMARK Yeah. Do you? \nSEAN We were right across the street, we saw the chimney come-- \nMARK Yeah. \nSEAN Is anybody hurt? \nMARK No. You live across the street. \nSHARON I'm Sharon. \nSEAN This is my girlfriend, Sharon. She lives across the street and I was helping her move out when we saw the chimney-- \nMARK Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool. \nSEAN You came to California. \nMARK Yeah. \nSEAN You made the right choice. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - LATER \nSEA,'s looking around the place. DUSTIN and the INTERNS are standing off to the side, happy to be in the presenbe of Sean Parker. ANDREW'S still locked into his computer. MARK's off in the kitchen. \nMARK (OS) Here you go. A beer comes flying out of the kitchen and SEAN catches it. \nMARK (OS) (CONT'D) Sharon. Another beer comes flying out which SHARON had no idea was coming and so it smashes into the fireplace. \nSHARON Oh God. I'm so sorry. And a brick comes down the chimney and crashes on top of the broken glass from the beer bottle. \nDUSTIN You know, ironically, we're paying an extra 50 bucks a month 'cause it has a working fireplace. \nSEAN This house is great. The team is great. It's exactly what it should be. \n(TO ANDREW) I'm Sean Parker. MARK comes out of the kitchen-- \nMARK He's wired in. \nSEAN That's what I'm talkin' about.

RUBY SKYE - NIGHT \nAn ultra-hip San Prancisco nightclub where a line of well- dressed young people stretches from the clipboard holding BOUNCER down the block. The BOUNCER motions to three SEXY GIRLS who are let in through the velvet rope. If this reminds us of the scene at the final club party at the beginning of this story than that's fine. The three SEXY GIRLS take us into \nINT. RUBY SKYE - CONTINUOUS \nIt's a hundred-year old theater that's been converted into a 21st Century hot spot for Silicon Valley's rock stars. The lower level is a giant dance floor packed\"with sweating 20- somethings bouncing to pounding house music. There are raised blocks where scantily dressed professional. dancers perform non- stop. A huge lighting grid hangs from the ceiling shooting colored lights and lasers everywhere. Also hanging from the ceiling are two trapeze bars with two performers swinging and contorting. \nA WAITRESS holding a tray of colored drinks high over her head takes us through the crowd to a spiral staircase that's being guarded by two more BOUNCERS with clipboards. The staircase leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP tables that look out over the dance floor. Each VIP area has a couple of couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka, tequila, rum, mixers, ice, glasses and a private waitress who's happy to bend over and pour a drink for you, And that's where we catch up with MARK and SEAN. Sitting next to SEAN is a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and there's another standing behind him and leaning against the couch. MARK and SEAN have to speak the music. \nMARK I still can't believe I rented a house across the street from you. \nSEAN That's not my house. It was Sharon's. I was crashing there for a little. bit while I'm taking care of some things. But she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place and I'm homeless. \nNARK Yeah? \n(BEAT) You can crash at our. place for a few days if you want. \nSEAN That's sol..id man, thanks, \nBEAUTIFUL WOMAN #1 I'm going to the ladies' room; \nSEAN You got it. \nBEAUTIFUL WOMAN #2 I'll go with you. The two girls exit-- \nMARK Your date looks so familiar to me, \nSEAN She looks familiar to a lot of people. \nMARK What do you mean? \nSEAN Look at any Victoria's Secret catalogue from the last six months. \n. MARK \n(PAUSE) You're kidding. \nSEAN No man. I'll tell you something, you know how I founded Napster? \nMARK I know everything there is to know about you Sean. \nSEAN Fuck Wikipedia, Mark, no you don't. \n(BEAT) I was going out with this girl in high school. And it was great. I thought it was great, but the whole time--almost the .whole time we were together., like five months--she was giving blow. jobs to the co-captain of the lacrosse team. And I found out and I was willing to forgive her but she told me she loved him. So I had this dream that I would make a billion dollar company.. Not a million dollar company--any hack can do that---a billion dollar company. And I would have business cards printed up that said, \"I'm CEO.. .Bitch. \" \n(BEAT) It's our time. We run the universe. Yeah, she's a Victoria's Secret model. I want to know where the fuck Eduardo is. \nMARK He has an internship. \nSEAN An internship? \n", "test3_true": "SEAN The company's here. A billion dollar company is here. And what confuses me is that in New York, Eduardo introduced himself as the business head of Facebook. I've been at the front of two of the biggest things in the history of the internet and I can tell you that nothing, nothing is more important to a start-up than the energy and ambition of its founders. \n(MORE) \nSEAN (CONT-D) You have to live and breathe the project every minute of every day and-night. Do you live and breathe Facebook? \nMARK Yes. \nSEAN I know you do. I know those guys back at the house do.

So I'll ask again--where's Eduar \nMARK \n(PAUSE) It'd be great if you stayed at the house with us. \nSEAN I think I should.

MARK and SEAN aren't paying attention... \nSEAN What's your goal for the summer? \nMARK We want: to . be in a hundred schools. \n-SEAN okay. Okay good. I'll tell you what. Gesture of good faith. While you're getting yourself into a hundred schools, I'm gonna put you on two continents. \nMARK \n(BEAT) What? \nSEAN Let's line up some shots. (to the WAITRESS) You can take away the Cuervo, we'll have Don Julio 1942. \nWAITRESS Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

THE THAMES -- DAY \nwe're looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of Henley, England--founded in 1179. And after a moment of placid quiet-- \n---BOOSHI Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and prestigious Henley Royal Regatta. The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the \"H\" of Harvard. We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot -- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n blazers and brightly colored floral ties. But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural. straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half torture test against the best competition they've ever faced. And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the Dutch. The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late. Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of Americans. \nWe'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and latex we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next to him is their mother, who can barely watch. Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and there's still no daylight between them. We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin to stream down his arm. 25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy-- even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed-- the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position. The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig, and pull, and pull, and pull, and--- \nPOP! --the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over. CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up. The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop. The MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses to look away. From CAMERON and TYLER, just the'breathing., \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AWARD CEREMONY - DAY \nCAMERON and TYLER are standing with their coaches and next to the two DUTCH CREWMEN who are with their coaches. They're on a stand in the Steward's Enclosure, a sprawling and glamorous tented area for the exclusive use of members and their guests. After a moment, a man in a double breasted navy blazer steps out with his retinue in tow. The man is PRINCE ALBERT of Monaco. He receives a healthy clapping of golf applause as he approaches the stand. This conversation is done without microphones or anything as modern as that. \nAIDE His Royal Highness, Prince Albert. Sir, may I present Mr. Cameron Winklevoss and Mr. Tyler. Winklevoss of Harvard University. \nPRINCE ALBERT Brilliant race. Never seen a race that close. Less than one second, the steward tells me. \nTYLER \n(BEAT) Yes, Your Highness. \nPRINCE ALBERT My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of the premiere rowers of his day. I've been coming to Henley for 30 years. Never seen a race that close. Have you? Have you seen a race that close? CAMERON is thinking about starting a war with Monaco right now so he lets his brother do the talking. \nTYLER \n(BEAT) No, Your Highness. Mile and a half races are more commonly won by a boat length or two. \nPRINCE ALBERT Yes, that's absolutely right. Less than a second though in your case. Well as they say, I suppose it just came down to who wanted it more. \nCAMERON \n(SNAPPING) Oh what a bullshit cliche: You think we \nDIDN'T--- \nTYLER \n(EASY) Cam. There's an awkward silence for a moment... \nPRINCE ALBERT Will I have the pleasure of watching you both row again in Beijing? \nTYLER If we make the team, sir, yes. Thank you. \nPRINCE ALBERT I present you with your Second Place ribbons. On to the champions! \nAnd off the APPLAUSE from the crowd, we \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. STEWARD'S TENT - DAY \nThe regatta party is underway. Music, drinks, uniformed waiters, blazers and hats everywhere. TYLER and CAMERON have changed into their Harvard. blazers and are joined now by DIVYA. The three of them have tried to find an unpopulated spot. TYLER and DIVYA have glasses of beer and are standing but CAMERON's sitting at a table with a laptop open and watching film of the end of the race. Hitting reverse on the computer and watching, over and over again, the bow of the Dutch boat pull ahead by six inches at just the right moment. \nCAMERON Yeah. We didn't want it enough. That was the problem. Fuck you, you fucking little-- \nDIVYA Casa. The guy' s the prince of a country the size of East Hampton. Let it go. MR. WINKLEVOSS has made his way over... \nMR. WINKLEVOSS Boys. \nTYLER Dad. \nMR. WINKLEVOSS Divya. \nDIVYA How are-you, Mr. Winklevoss. \nMR. WINKLEVOSS That was a tough beat. A tough beat. \nCAMERON I'm sorry, dad. You and mom flew all the way over. \nMR. WINKLEVOSS Listen to me good, you two. Don't you ever apologize to me for losing a race like that. Don't you ever apologize to anyone for losing a race like that. Another man comes along, MR. KENWRIGHT. \nKENWRIGHT -Boys. \nTYLER Oh. Mr. Kenwright. Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright, part of our host family this week. \nKENWRIGHT Pleasure to meet you. \nMR. WINKLEVOSS Good to meet you. \nKENWRIGHT I just had the most extraordinary phone chat with my daughter. She told me that she and her friends are all talking about the race, which ended just, a half-hour ago, via their computers. A new website called Facebook. Do you have this in America?

He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland and the closest we've come to talking face to face is when I saw him on. the quad and chased him through Harvard Square. \nSUMMERS You chased him? \nCAMERON \n(BEAT) I saw him and I know he saw me and I started after him and he disappeared \nSUMMERS You know he could have you arrested for harassment and attempted assault. \nTYLER \n(QUIETLY) This isn't happening. \nSUMMERS I don't see this as a University issue. \nTYLER Of course it's a University issue. There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both. \nSUMMERS You entered into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other. \nTYLER \n(BEAT) I'm sorry President Summers, what you just said makes no sense to me at all. \nSUMMERS I'm devastated by that. \nCAMERON What my brother means is that if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer it would be a university issue, right? \nSUMMERS I really don't know. This office doesn't handle petty larceny and the only reason I agreed to see you--Anne; by did I agree to see them? \nANNE Colleagues of their father. \nSUMMERS So you see? \nTYLER This isn't a petty larceny. \nCAMERON \n(CALMING) \nTY-- \nTYLER This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars. \nSUMMERS Millions of dollars? \nCAMERON Yes. \nSUMMERS You might be letting your imagination run away with you. \nTYLER With all due respect I don't think you're in any position to make that call. \nSUMMERS I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in some position to make that call. \nTYLER Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshmen address. \nSUMMERS Well. I would try letting your- imaginations run away with you on a new project. \nTYLER You would. \nSUMMERS Everyone at Harvard is inventing something or starting a new business in their dorm room- Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than getting one so can I suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project? \nCAMERON I'm sorry, but that-'s not the point, sir. \nSUMMERS What's the point? \nCAMERON You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand-the, difference between right and wrong. \nSUMMERS And you're saying that I don't? \nCAMERON Of course I'm not saying that. \nTYLER I'm saying that.

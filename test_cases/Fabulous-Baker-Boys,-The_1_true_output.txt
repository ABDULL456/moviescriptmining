JACK Am I late? 
FRANK That's not the point. 
JACK (taking out a cigarette) What's the point? 
FRANK You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack. 
JACK You want me to show up late a few nights? 
FRANK Jack. 
JACK Frank. 
FRANK Jack. 
JACK Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it. 
FRANK Christ, will you look at your hair? 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Jack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold. 
JACK What's wrong with it? 
FRANK You look like you just crawled out of bed. 
JACK No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on. 
Frank just stands there, bottled up with exasperation. 
JACK (continuing) Careful, Frank.  When you get angry your tie starts to spin. 
Jack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his head, follows.  As they move away, a cardboard stand-up is revealed.  On it are two 8 X 10 glossies of Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters, this: "Tonight!  The Doubly Delightful Tones of the Fabulous Baker Boys!" 
BAKER BROTHERS 
as they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent that what the "Fabulous Baker Boys" are, in fact, is a poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher. 
WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE 
As they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables of middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads. After a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and the couples applaud. 
FRANK (Mr.  Smile) Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome to the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker and eighty-eight keys across from me is my little brother, Jack. 
Applause.  Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes a draw on his cigarette. 
FRANK (continuing; could do this in his sleep) You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack? 
JACK Twenty-eight years, Frank. 
Applause. 
FRANK That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack? 
JACK Lotta water. 
FRANK Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil. (to Jack) We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack? 
Laughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of razor blades. 
FRANK (continuing) But seriously.  It's been fifteen years since Jack and I first stepped on the stage as professionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities, and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later... well, believe me, we've seen our share of this crazy country of ours.  But even though we've played some of the finest venues in the world ... 
At this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words. 
FRANK (continuing) ... There's one place that's always been, for us, a very special place, and that place is... this place, the Starfire lounge. 
Jack lays in a few soft bass chords. 
FRANK (continuing) Why?  Well, I guess you could just say it's the ... (pregnant moment) ... people. 
At which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard and give birth to the melody of -- what else?  "People.' 
JACK AND FRANK - LATER They exit the stage to applause. 
FRANK Thank you.  Remember, room service is available till one A.M. for you late-nighters. 
INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN 
Jack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen. 
FRANK Don't make trouble, all right? 
JACK Who's gonna make trouble? (spotting someone) Hey, amigo! 
JACK'S POV - MAN 
in an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone, looks up. 
BACK TO SCENE 
MAN Jack! (lower) Frank. 
FRANK (the feeling's mutual) Yeah, hi, Hector. 
HECTOR (MAN) (re: the soup bone) For Eddie.  I wrap. 
JACK Gracias. 
FRANK (as they exit) I mean it, Jack.  Behave. 
JACK Like an angel.

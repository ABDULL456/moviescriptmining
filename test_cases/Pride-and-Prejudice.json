{"train": "PRIDE AND PREJUDICE \nWritten by \nDeborah Moggach \n1 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. I \nA vast mansion is coming to life. Maids pull dustsheets off furniture; servants open shutters. Sunshine spills into the great rooms of Netherfield. outside, a glimpse of rolling parkland. \nTITLE: \"It is a truth universally acknowledged... \nIts a whirlwind of activity. Servants bustle around, sweeping and polishing, readying the house for its new occupants. The shutters of a room are opened onto the imposing gardens. A coach pulls up and, through the window, we see a young man get out. \n\"that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife\" \nA white sheet is pulled from a spinet and obscures our vision. \nCUT TO: \n2 EXT. LONGBOURN HOUSE - DAY. 2 \nElizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down 17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where, through an open window to the library, we see her mother and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet. \nMRS BENNET My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last? We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear her parents' conversation. \nMRS BENNET (CONT'D) Do you not want to know who has taken it? \nMR BENNET As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have any choice in the matter... \n3 INT. LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS. \nAs Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door to the library. \nLYDIA \n(TO ELIZABETH) Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man from the North of England, has come down on Monday in a chaise and four. \nKITTY With five thousand a year! Jane, (the eldest, most beautiful and most charmingly naive of the girls), joins them at the door. \nJANE Goodness! \nLYDIA - and he's single to be sure! \nINT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS. \nMr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet. \nMRS BENNET What a fine thing for our girls! \nMR BENNET Bow can it affect them? \nMRS BENNET My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome! You know that he must marry one of them. \nMR BENNET Oh, so that is his design in settling here? Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of the library into the corridor where the girls are gathered, Mrs Bennet following. \n4 INT. CORRIDOR - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. \nMr Bennet walks through the girls to the drawing room pursued by Mrs Bennet. \nMRS BENNET - So you must go and visit him at once. \n5 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 5 \nMr Bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he is carrying. Mary is there practising the piano. The girls come in to listen. \nLYDIA Oh, yes, Papa. \nKITTY Please, Papa! \nMR BENNET There is no need, for I already have. The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare. \nMRS BENNET You have? \nJANE when? \nMRS BENNET \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have no compassion for my poor nerves? \nCHARLOTTE On the contrary, he has ten thousand a year and owns half of Derbyshire. \nCUT TO: Sir William Lucas, 53 a hale but unsophisticated member of the self-made gentry, takes it upon himself to introduce Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy to his daughter Charlotte and the Bennet family. \nSIR WILLIAM (to Mr Bingley) My eldest daughter you know, Mrs Bennet ...miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet. \nMRS BENNET It is a pleasure. I have two others but \nthey are already dancing. \nMR BINGLEY Delighted to make your acquaintance. \nSIR WILLIAM And may I introduce Mr Darcy. \n(SIGNIFICANT LOOK) -- of Pemberley, in Derbyshire! A stiff bow from Darcy, Elizabeth smiles, Darcy does not. \nCUT TO: Moments later. Elizabeth is standing in a small group with Jane, Bingley, Miss Bingley and Darcy. Bingley can't keep his eyes off Jane, but is frightfully at a loss in disguising his instant ardour. \nELIZABETH How do you like it here in Hertfordshire, Mr Bingley? \nMR BINGLEY (smiling at Jane shyly) Very much. \nELIZABETH The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest in the country. \nMR BINGLEY Yes, it fills me with guilt. He looks at Jane a little blush starts around his collar. \nBINGLEY Not a good reader, you see. I like being out of doors. I mean, I can read, of \nCOURSE - His sister steps in. as the blush threatens to engulf his ears. \nMISS BINGLEY \n(TO DARCY) Your library at Pemberly, Mr Darcy, is astonishingly good. \nDARCY Thank you. It is the work of many generations. \nMISS BINGLEY And then you have added so much to it yourself. \nJANE I wish I read more, but there always seems so many other things to do. \nBINGLEY That's exactly what I meant. He beams at Jane. \nCUT TO: Mr and Mrs Bennet stand a little apart from Elizabeth and the other young people. Lydia and Kitty bound up to them in a state of high excitement. \nLYDIA Mama! The regiment is arriving next week! \nKITTY And will be here for the whole winter! Mrs Forster told us! \nLYDIA They're going to be stationed in the village! \nCUT TO: Mr Bingley'turns to Jane. \nMR BINGLEY May I have the honour? They leave, to dance. \nELIZABETH Do you dance Mr Darcy? \nDARCY Not if I can help it. Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as they over hear the following... \nCUT TO: \nLYDIA officers! Lots of officers! \nKITTY How will we meet them? \nLYDIA It's easy. You just walk up and down in front of them and drop something. Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty. \nLYDIA \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you sir' and blush prettily and then you're introduced! \nMR BENNET I have long suspected that we have two of the silliest girls in the county. \nMRS BENNET Oh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself, and if a smart young colonel with six thousand a year should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him. Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie moves away. \nCUT TO: The dance floor. Mr Bingley is dancing with Jane. His ears blushing with thrilled embarrassment. Mrs Bennet, with a group of other mothers, watches the young couple with rather too obvious satisfaction. \nMRS BENNET 7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Though of course my Jane needs little help from couturiers. Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and demure, he clearly smitten - \nCUT TO: Darcy is joined by Bingley exhilarated by the dance. \nJANE Lizzie! \nELIZABETH You're a great deal too apt to like people in general, you know. All the world is good and agreeable in your eyes. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 JANE Not his friend. I still cannot believe what he said about you. \nELIZABETH Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine. But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again. She blows out the candle. \n8 INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 8 \nMrs Bennet presides over breakfast with an endless description of the ball. Mary is doing some needle work, whilst Lydia, Kitty and Jane blearily eat. \nMRS BENNET And then he danced the third with Miss Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss King of little standing. And the fifth again with Jane. \nMR BENNET \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If he'd had any compassion for me he would have sprained his ankle in the first dance. \nMRS BENNET Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the girls looked forward to a grand inheritance. Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this speech many times before. \nMR BENNET \n(NOT LISTENING) Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter. \nMRS BENNET As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you die, which may in fact be very soon, our girls will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny to their name. \nELIZABETH Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the morning. Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 babbling. \nMRS HILL \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A letter addressed to Miss Bennet, Ma'arn. From Netherfield Hall. \nMRS BENNET Praise the Lord! We are saved. Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane. \nMRS BENNET (CONT'D) Make haste, Jane, make haste. 0 happy day! \nJANE It is from Miss Bingley. Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks. \nJANE (CONT'D) She has invited me to dine with her. \n(PAUSE) Her brother will be dining out. \nMRS BENNET This is most unfortunate. \nLYDIA I didn't think he was so good looking anyway. \nJANE Can I take the carriage? \nMRS BENNET Certainly not my dear, you will go to Netherfield on horse back. \nJANE Horseback?! Mrs Bennet leaves with a secret smile on her lips. \n9 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY. 9 \nJane rides through the countryside, A distant rumble of thunder. She looks up... \n10 EXT. FIELD - DAY. 10 \nAn open book. Plop plop! Raindrops fall on it. Drawing back, we see Lizzie walking through a field, reading. She looks up to the sky... \n11 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 11 \nMrs Bennet stands at the kitchen door. A boy is delivering meat. It starts to rain. She puts out her hand, to check. \nMRS BENNET (smiles, satisfied) Ah, good... The housekeeper, Mrs Hill, who is with her, looks bemused at her mistress's reaction. \n12 EXT. GARDEN - DAY. 12 \nA louder rumble of thunder. A washerwoman hastily pulls clothes from a line...it's bucketing down heavily now... \n13 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 13 \nIn the local.village people run for cover; shopkeepers cover up their wares... \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 14 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 14 \nMr and Mrs Bennet look out at the pouring rain. \nMRS BENNET Excellent. Now she will have to stay the night. Exactly as I predicted. \nMR BENNET Good grief, woman. Your skills in the art of match-making are without question. \nELIZABETH Jane! Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her. \nJANE Lizzie! Oh, your face is so cold. They're being so kind to me, I feel such a terrible imposition. \nELIZABETH Don't worry. I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley. Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Thank you for tending to my sister so diligently, it seems she is in better comfort here than she would be at home. \nBINGLEY It is a pleasure, I mean not to see her so sick, of course, that's terrible. I will have a room made up for you. You must be our guest here until Jane recovers. \n21 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD -- DAY. 21 \nDarcy is quietly reading as Bingley paces about anxiously. Caroline berates him from the sofa. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Stay!? She is a perfectly sweet girl but save being an excellent walker, there is very little to recommend her. \nBINGLEY I thought she showed remarkable spirit coming all this way. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY The eldest Miss Bennet, as you know, I hold in excessive regard and I wish her well settled. Though I do fear with her families low connections there is little chance of it. Their uncle is in trade, you know, in Cheapside. \nBINGLEY If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable. \n22 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN - DAY. 22 \nMr Bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the hedge. Mrs Bennet bustles up. She looks very pleased with herself. \nMRS BENNET Well, my dear, its all going according to plan. He's half in love with her already! \nMR BENNET (a touch disingenuously) Who, my sweetest? \nMRS BENNET Mr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the two of them. Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face lights up. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 MRS BENNET Wait for me! \nAnd she's gone. Mr Bennet gazes at their departing \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 figures. \n23 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 23 \nMrs Bennet and her two daughters rush down the street into the village. Dogs bark, children run alongside as a regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs Bennet, flushed and excited, runs panting behind them. Lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief. One of the soldiers stands on it. She is appalled. \n24 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD - EVENING. 24 \nElizabeth is reading a book. Darcy is writing a letter. Bingley is sat nervously. Caroline, obviously bored, wanders the room looking for distraction. She looks over Darcy's shoulder. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy. \nMR DARCY (without looking up) \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You are mistaken. I write rather slowly. Caroline Bingley lingers, annoyingly. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY How many letters you must have occasion to write, Mr Darcy. Letters of business too. How odious I should think them! \nDARCY It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Please tell your sister that I long to see her. \nDARCY I have already told her once, by your desire. Lizzie looks across from her book. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY I do dote on her, I was quite in raptures at her beautiful little design for a table. \nDARCY \nPerhaps you will give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again. At present I have not enough room to do them justice. Mr Bingley now pacing anxiously around the room. \nMR BINGLEY Its amazing, how young ladies have the patience to be so accomplished. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY What do you mean, Charles? \nMR BINGLEY They all paint tables, and embroider cushions and play the piano. I never heard of a young lady, but people say she is accomplished. \nDARCY The word is indeed applied too liberally. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen women, in all my acquaintance, that are truely accomplished. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 CAROLINE BINGLEY Nor I, to be sure! \nELIZABETH Goodness! You must comprehend a great deal in the idea. \nDARCY I do. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Absolutely. She must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing and the modern languages, to deserve the word. And something in her air and manner of walking. \nDARCY I find it perfectly adequate even if society is a little less varied than in town. \nMRS BENNET But I assure you there is quite as much going on in the country as there is in the town. \nELIZABETH Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely meant there were not such a variety of people to be met in the country as there are in town, which you must acknowledge to be true. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 MRS BENNET Nonsense, we dine with four and twenty families. Sir William Lucas for instance is a very agreeable man. So very genteel and easy. Elizabeth cringes. \nLYDIA Mr Bingley, is it true that you have promised to hold a ball here at Netherfield? \nBINGLEY Well... \nLYDIA It would be an excellent way to meet new friends. You could invite the militia. \nKITTY Oh do hold a ball. \nELIZABETH (trying to stop Bingley being \nBAMBOOZLED) Kitty... \nBINGLEY When your sister has recovered you shall name the day. \nMARY I think a Ball is a perfectly irrational way to gain new acquaintance. It would be better if conversation instead of dancing were the order of the day. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Indeed much more rational but rather less like a ball. \nELIZABETH Thank you, Mary. \nBINGLEY (to Mrs Bennet) Please let me show you to Jane, you will find her quite recovered. \nCUT TO: \n30 EXT. DRIVE -- NETHERFIELD - DAY. \nThe Bennet's carriage awaits. The Bingley's are gathered to see the Bennet's off. Jane is radiant - in the peak of health. \nJANE (to the Bingley's) Really, I don't know how to thank you. Bingley beams bashfully. He can't take his eyes off her. \nBINGLEY Really, you're welcome anytime you feel the least bit poorly. \nELIZABETH \n(TO CAROLINE) Thank you for such stimulating company. It has been most instructive. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Not at all. The pleasure is all mine. Elizabeth looks at Darcy, who does not say anything. She gets in the carriage. \nELIZABETH Mr Darcy. \nDARCY Miss Bennet. They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley waves enthusiastically to Jane. \nBINGLEY Goodbye. Goodbye. \n31 INT. CARRIAGE - LEAVING NETHERFIELD - THE SAME. 31 \nThe family are all squeezed in rather too tightly. \nMRS BENNET What a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy is, quite eaten up with pride. \n32 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 3 \nThe Bennet's carriage is stopped in its tracks by the Militia who are marching en masse through town. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 33 INT. CARRIAGE - MERYTON - DAY. 33 \nLydia cannot believe her eyes as row after row of soldiers pass by the carriage with not a few of the men looking in at the Bennet girls with some interest. \nLYDIA I can't believe it, there must be a thousand of them. Leading the one troupe of Militia is Wickham a very handsome blonde officer, Lydia spots him and swoons. \nELIZABETH (to the coachman) Please, drive on. \n34 INT. LONGBOURN - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. 34 \nAs the Bennet girls come into the house, Lydia eulogizing the Militia, they meet Mr Bennet. \nMR BENNET I hope, my dear, that you have ordered a good dinner today, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family \nparty. Mr Bennet holds up the letter. \nLater; we can see the girls and Mr Bennet gathered by the fire through the doorway. Mr Collins leaves the room and takes Mrs Bennet aside to a very discrete conference, out of hearing of anyone else. \nCOLLINS Mrs Bennet. You do know I have been bestowed by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bough a parsonage of no mean size. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 MRS BENNET I have become aware of the fact. \nCOLLINS \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Well, it.is my avowed hope that soon I may find a mistress for it, and I have to inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet has captured my special attention. Collins looks lasciviously into the room. \nMRS BENNET Mr Collins, unfortunately it is incumbent on me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet is - very soon to be engaged. \nCOLLINS Engaged! \nMRS BENNET But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both age and beauty would make anyone an excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr Collins? Mr Collins looks through the doorway at Elizabeth \nCOLLINS Indeed. Indeed. A very agreeable alternative. \n39 EXT. BACK MEADOW - LONGBOURN - DAY. 39 \nElizabeth and Jane are walking towards the house when, across the moat, they see Mr Collins come out of the house and advance towards them. \nELIZABETH Oh no! Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them. \nELIZABETH Quick! This way! She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat, through the house and out the front. Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house. The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around, puzzled. \n40 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 40 \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Elizabeth and Jane arrive in the village. Jane, forever the dutiful daughter, looks uneasy- Elizabeth is flushed and reckless. She looks behind them- \nELIZABETH \n(LAUGHS) \nWe've lost him. They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled hair. The perfect romantic hero. \nELIZABETH Kitty? Lydia! She and Jane join them. \nLYDIA We just happened to be looking for some ribbon, didn't we, Kitty? \n(KITTY NODS) And we met Mr Wickham. \nKITTY He picked up Lydia's gloves! \nLYDIA He's a lieutenant! Wickham bows. \nWICKHAM I'm enchanted. Shall we all look at some ribbons together? \nLYDIA Oh yes! \n41 INT. MILLINER'S SHOP - DAY. 41 \nThey come into the shop. The others go towards the counter. Wickham hangs back, and smiles a complicit, witty smile at Elizabeth. She colours. \nWICKHAM Though I must warn you, I have very poor taste. \nELIZABETH \n(SMILES) Only a man truly confident of himself would admit that. \nWICKHAM No, it's true. My rooms in town, decorated, I thought, in the height of \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 fashion, have reduced grown men to tears of mirth. \nELIZABETH' \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 (LAUGHS) Then why don't you change them? \nMR WICKHAM And deny people such pleasure? \nELIZABETH So you don't mind being laughed at? \nMR WICKHAM Not particularly. \nELIZABETH It is a somewhat sterile quality, is it not, to be aware of ones importance in the world. \nWICKHAM Especially if, like me, one has none. Elizabeth looks at him with interest. A beat. The moment is broken by Lydia coming up. \nLYDIA Lizzie, please lend me some money! \nELIZABETH \nWICKHAM (CONT'D) You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, especially given the cold manner of our intimacy this afternoon. Are you well acquainted with that gentleman? \nELIZABETH As much as I could ever wish to be. I have spent four days in the same house as him, and I think him very disagreeable. \nWICKHAM I cannot pretend to be sorry. Elizabeth blushes. \nWICKHAM But really I speak out of turn. Collins voice breaks the moment. \nCOLLINS Miss Elizabeth, I was just saying to Sir William what appalling weather we've been having. \nElizabeth cannot believe her misfortune in Mr Collins, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 but she smiles politely. \nELIZABETH I think I shall take a little air. She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony. As she passes the other tables we follow and witness snippets of their conversations. \nCHARLOTTE \n(TO MARY) It seems Mr Wickham has met with universal approval. Though Lizzie looks singularly pleased with him. \nMARY At the moment she has more suitors than sense. Charlotte looks over at Mr Collins. Elizabeth passes Sir William's side of the table. \nSIR WILLIAM Now any one for a round of bridge? Elizabeth? \nELIZABETH \nReally I need to take some air. Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth. \nSIR WILLIAM Mr Collins? \nCOLLINS Oh, I am not so familiar with the game, Sir William. \nSIR WILLIAM Absolute nonsense. I insist that you join us. \nCHARLOTTE Please, Mr Collins, I'd be happy if you'd \nPARTNER ME_ Collins resigns himself to his fate. Elizabeth smiles and slips out into the night air. \n44 EXT. BALCONY - THE LUCASES HOUSE - MERYTON - NIGHT. 44 \nElizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses someone join her. She looks round to see Wickham has followed her as she had hoped. \nELIZABETH \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I hope your plans in favor of Meryton will not be affected by your difficult relations with the gentleman we were just speaking of. \nWICKHAM Oh no - it is not for me to be driven away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go not I. Pause. \nELIZABETH I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy? \nWICKHAM Do you really want to hear? Lizzie nods. \nWICKHAM He ruined me. She stares at him. \nELIZABETH How so? \nWICKHAM My father managed his estate. We grew up together, Darcy and I. His father treated me like a second son. Oh he was the kindest of men and bequeathed me the best living in his gift, for I had my heart set on joining the church. But when he died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave the living to another man. \nLIZZIE Why did he do that? \nWICKHAM Out of jealousy, for his father loved me more than he loved him. \nLIZZIE How cruel! Are you sure? \nWICKHAM \n(NODS) And out of pride, for he considered me too lowly to be worth his consideration. \nPause. Lizzie gazes at him with horror and sympathy. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 45 INT. BEDROOMS - LONGBOURNE - THE SAME. 45 \nWe pan through the bedrooms as the Bennet girls prepare for the Netherfield ball. Kitty is helping Lydia into her dress, they are both wearing white. \nLYDIA Aggghh! \nKITTY Breathe in! We move to the quieter preparations of Jane and Elizabeth. This conversation has been going on for some time. \nJANE \n(HORRIFIED) - I still think there must have been a misunderstanding. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 ELIZABETH Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all - to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! \nCUT TO: Elizabeth dances face to face with Darcy. Neither can speak. They dance for a moment in silence. \nELIZABETH I do love a Sarabande. \nDARCY Indeed. Most invigorating. They continue, for a moment, in silence. \nELIZABETH It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples. \nDARCY I am perfectly happy to oblige, please advise me of what you would like most to \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 hear. \nELIZABETH That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But for now we may be silent. \nDARCY Do you talk as a rule while dancing? \nELIZABETH We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will - amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid embarrassment might be advantageous. \nDARCY I see no striking resemblance of your own character in this, how near it is to mine I cannot say. (beat) Tell me do you and your sisters very often walk to Meryton? \nThey are suddenly parted by the choreography of the dance. \nWe stay with Elizabeth who is whisked round the floor by an elderly man who smiles at her toothlessly, Elizabeth \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 looks back at Darcy who is dancing with Lydia. He stare at Elizabeth as he dances. Elizabeth smiles at her current partner in embarrassment. \nELIZABETH Very mild weather we've been having. \nDANCING PARTNER (deaf as a post) Sorry. The dance spins again and she is back with Darcy. \nELIZABETH Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a great opportunity to meet new people. In fact when you met us we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance. \nDARCY I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends - whether he is capable of retaining them is less certain. \nELIZABETH He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship. I remember hearing you once say that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created? \nDARCY I am. May I ask to what these questions tend. \nELIZABETH To make out your character, Mr Darcy. \nDARCY And what have you discovered? \nELIZABETH very little. The dancefinishes. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly. \nDARCY I hope to afford you more clarity in the \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 future. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 They bow to each other and Elizabeth moves quickly away from Darcy. \nCUT TO: Elizabeth is at the buffet watching Kitty quaff a huge glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled. She is joined by Caroline Bingley who also looks at Kitty disapprovingly. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Miss Elizabeth. Let me recommend you as a friend not to give too much confidence to all of the assertions your friend Mr Wickham might make. He is indeed a charming man, but one should never forget from where he is descended. \nELIZABETH His lack of trustworthiness and descent appear by your account to be the same thing, \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Please excuse my interterence, it was kindly meant. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A breathless Mr Collins appears. \nCOLLINS Is that Mr Darcy, of Pemberley in Derbyshire? \nELIZABETH I believe so. \nCOLLINS But I must make myself known to him immediately! \nELIZABETH But sir - \nCOLLINS He is the nephew of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine. \nELIZABETH \n(SURPRISED) He is? Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards Darcy. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 ELIZABETH Please, Mr Collins! He'll consider it an \nIMPERTINENCE -- \nElizabeth watches from a distance, with acute embarrassment, as Collins interrupts Darcy. Darcy does not notice him so Collins raises his voice. \nCOLLINS (CONT'D) Mr Darcy! The room around him stops. Darcy is surprised and turns round. In dumbshow we see Darcy is horrified by Collins' obsequiousness, during the conversation Collins points Elizabeth out to Darcy. \nMR COLLINS My object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one from amongst Mr Bennet's daughters, for as you know I am next in the entail of the estate and such an alliance will surely make amends for this. (drops to his knee) And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affections. \nELIZABETH Mr Collins - \nMR COLLINS And that no reproach on the subject of fortune will cross my lips once we are \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 married. \nELIZABETH You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I have made no answer. \nMR COLLINS \n(UNPERTURBED) I must add, that Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve, when I speak to her of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities. \nELIZABETH Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but regret I must decline it. \nMR COLLINS (momentarily taken aback, but \nRECOVERING) I know ladies have their pretty little ways, and don't seek to seem too eager - \nELIZABETH (in some desperation) Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make me happy and I'm convinced I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 MR COLLINS \n(PAUSE) I 'flatter myself, cousin, that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy. Besides, you should take into account that despite your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made to you - \nELIZABETH (rising, deeply affronted) Mr Collins - \nMR COLLINS So I must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females. \nELIZABETH Sir! I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man. Please understand me - I cannot accept you! Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house. Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the tail of Elizabeth. \nMRS BENNET Declined indeed! The headstrong, foolish \nCHILD- \nCOLLINS Thank you, but... Head strong? \nMRS BENNET - we shall have this little hiccup dealt with immediately, Mr Collins. Mrs Bennet goes chases after Elizabeth. Mr Collins watches through a window as Elizabeth is chased by her mother. \n51 INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 51 \nMrs Bennet marches into the library. Mr Bennet looks up in shock. \nMRS BENNET Oh Mr Bennet. We are all in a uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr Collins, for she vows she will not have him. \nMr Bennet starter at Mrs Bennet blankley. \nMRS BENNET Mr Collins, Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie. But Lizzy declares she will not have him, and now the danger is Mr Collins may not have Lizzy. \nMR BENNET And what am I to do? Mrs Bennet drags Mr Bennet to his feet. \nMRS BENNET Speak to Lizzy. They march to find Elizabeth. \n52 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 52 \nMr Bennet and Mrs Bennet confront Elizabeth, who has been waiting in the hallway. Perhaps the other girls form an audience from the stairs, Mr Collins looks on sheepishly from the breakfast room. \nMRS BENNET Tell her that you insist upon them marrying. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 LIZZIE Papa, please - '. \nMRS BENNET You will have this house! \nLIZZIE I can't marry him! \nMRS BENNET You'll save your sisters from destitution! \nLIZZIE I can't! - \nMRS BENNET Go back now and say you've changed your mind! \nLIZZIE No! \nMRS BENNET Think of your family! \nLIZZIE You can't make me! \nMRS BENNET Mr Bennet, say something! \nMR KENNET Still, it's a comfort to know that whatever might befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will be sure to make the most of it. A small smile from Elizabeth. \n58 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY 58 \nElizabeth is making the bed and tidying Jane's belongings. There is a knock at the door and Charlotte enters. \nCHARLOTTE My dear Elizabeth, I've come here to tell you the news. \nELIZABETH \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What news? \nCHARLOTTE \n(DEFIANTLY) Mr Collins and I are engaged to be married. A stunned pause. \nELIZABETH Engaged? \nCHARLOTTE \n(TIMIDLY) You don't mind, do you? \nELIZABETH No, no... (tries to recover) Of course not. \nCHARLOTTE He asked for my hand this morning .and I accepted him. Elizabeth looks quite faint. Charlotte sits on the bed. Elizabeth, after a pause, sits down beside her. \nCHARLOTTE I can see you're surprised - coming so soon after his wishing to marry you... \nELIZABETH \n(WEAKLY) No... \nCHARLOTTE I'm not a romantic, you know. I ask only a comfortable home, and considering Mr Collin's character, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can hope for. \nELIZABETH And that's all you expect? \nCHARLOTTE For women in our situation, what choice is there? \nELIZABETH \n(PASSIONATELY) Don't speak like that, Charlotte! \nCHARLOTTE \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 - to become an old maid, at best tolerated, at worst a burden, dependent on the kindness of others? Or to seek the protection of marriage. \nELIZABETH And we only have two choices? \nCHARLOTTE Yes. An appalled silence. Elizabeth gazes at her closest friend. Charlotte has recovered herself. she now looks cool and composed - unnervingly so. \nELIZABETH You can still change your mind, Charlotte. \nCHARLOTTE (shakes her head) I'm twenty-seven years old. We hear the sound of the militia drums... \n59 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 59 \nThe militia are leaving Meryton. Hundreds of soldiers and officers in the red coats marching out of the village to the sound of pipes and drums. The villagers are out to bid them farewell. Lydia and Kitty run through the crowds very distraught. They find Elizabeth coming in the other direction. \nLYDIA It's too dreadful! They're leaving for Brighton. \nELIZABETH All of them? \nKITTY They got the call this morning. \nLYDIA Not a word of warning! Lydia wails. Elizabeth searches the red coats for Wickham. She spots him, he glances across at her, she gives a pathetic wave and he's gone. Lydia and Kitty chase the last of the officers, leaving Elizabeth alone. She walks into the post office. \nC 60 INT. VILLAGE POST OFFICE - THE SAME. 6 \nThe Postmaster hands a letter to Elizabeth. Elizabeth opens it and reads it. \nPOSTMASTER Bad news, Miss? \nELIZABETH It could not be worse. I have been invited to possibly the very last place on earth I would like to go. \n61 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 61 \nElizabeth comes out of the post office to reveal... Time has passed, the now deserted village is covered in a thick blanket of snow. A lonely Elizabeth walks away totally despondent. \n62 EXT. HUNSFORD PARSONAGE - KENT - DAY. 6< \nCharlotte's new home is a smallish but charming rectory in Kent. Charlotte greets Elizabeth, kissing her warmly. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Mr Collins bows as he ushers her in. \n(EAGERLY) It's very kind of you to ask us to dine, Lady Catherine. Lady Catherine ignores her. \nMR COLLINS (whispers to Lizzie) The chimneypiece alone cost \u00c2\u00a3400. But Lizzie doesn't hear. Darcy walks into the room. Lizzie freezes. When he sees Lizzie he, too, falters, and recovers himself. Another man (Fitzwilliam) is with him. \nELIZABETH \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Mr Darcy! What are you doing here? \nMR COLLINS Mr Darcy! (another deep bow) I had no idea we would have the honour... A stiff bow from Darcy, who looks at Mr Collins as if he's something brought in by the dog. He turns to Lizzie, trying to collect himself. \nDARCY \n(BOWS) Miss Bennet...I'm staying here. \nLADY CATHERINE \n(SURPRISED) You know my nephew? \nELIZABETH Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting him in Hertfordshire. Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap, introduces himself. \nFITZWILLIAM \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do? He bows. Lizzie returns his smile gratefully. They move towards the dining room. Mr Collins leans towards Lizzie. \nMR COLLINS \n(WHISPERING) You know Mr Darcy is as good as engaged to Miss de Bourg? \nELIZABETH Really? Miss Bingley will be disappointed to hear that. (looks at the girl, and whispers to charlotte) What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh yes, they should suit each other very well. Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has more at stake. 68 INT. DINING ROOM - ROSINGS - NIGHT. f 9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen waiting, thousands of candles. \nLady Catherine seats herself at the head of the table. The guests wait for their orders. \nLADY CATHERINE You sit there and you sit there. Mr Collins! You can't sit next to your wife! After some awkward shuffling around they all sit down. Lizzie, much to her discomfort, finds herself sitting next to Darcy. There is a pause. \nMR DARCY I trust your family is in good health, Miss Bennet? \nELIZABETH They are, thank you. \n(PAUSE) My eldest sister is currently in London, perhaps you happened to see her there? \nMR DARCY \n(AWKWARD PAUSE) I haven't been fortunate enough, no. Lizzie looks at him. He colours slightly. Lady Catherine addresses Lizzie in a loud voice, from the head of the table. \nLADY CATHERINE Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet? \nELIZABETH A little, ma'am, and very poorly. \nLADY CATHERINE Oh. Do you draw? \nELIZABETH No, not at all. \nLADY CATHERINE Your sisters, do they draw? \nELIZABETH Not one. \nLADY CATHERINE That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of the masters. \nELIZABETH My mother would have no objection but my father hates London. \nLADY CATHERINE \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Has your governess left you? \nELIZABETH We never had a governess. Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches Elizabeth, keenly. \nLADY CATHERINE No governess? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess, I never heard such a thing! Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education. \nELIZABETH (can't help smiling at this) Not at all, Lady Catherine. \nLADY CATHERINE Mmmm. Are any of your younger sisters out? \nELIZABETH Yes, ma'am. All. \nLADY CATHERINE All! What, five out at once? Very odd! \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 And you only the second - the younger ones out before the elders are married! Your youngest sisters must be very young. \nELIZABETH Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I think it would be very hard on younger sisters, not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried. And to be kept back on such a motive! It would hardly encourage sisterly affection. \nLADY CATHERINE Upon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age? \nELIZABETH \n(SMILES) With three younger sisters grown up, your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to \nELIZABETH He is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him. Darcy sits down. \nELIZABETH Shall I call for some tea? \nDARCY No. Thankyou. The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up. \nDARCY Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a pleasure. He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused and intrigued. \nCUT TO: Charlotte, in the hallway, taking off her bonnet. Darcy hurries past her, with a swift bow, and leaves abruptly. Charlotte gazes after him in surprise. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Charlotte heads to the drawing room where she finds Elizabeth sitting, bemused. \nCHARLOTTE What on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy? \nELIZABETH. I have no idea. 73 She truly doesn't. Charlotte gives Elizabeth a look 73 \n71 EXT. HUNSFORD CHURCH - DAY. 71 \nSunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the \" church. Mr Collins, in his vestments, obeises himself to Lady Catherine, who is sweeping out with her miserable- looking daughter and downtrodden governess. Elizabeth joins Colonel Fitzwilliam. They walk down the path together. \nELIZABETH How long do you plan to stay in Kent, Colonel? \nFITZWILLIAM As long as Darcy chooses. I am at his disposal. \nELIZABETH I do imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly to have someone to order around. I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind. \nFITZWILLIAM She would be a lucky woman. \nELIZABETH Really? \nFITZWILLIAM Darcy is a most loyal companion. From what I heard, on our journey here, he recently came to the rescue of one of his friends just in time. Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops, at the churchyard gate. \nELIZABETH What happened? \nFITZWILLIAM He saved the man from an imprudent marriage. \nELIZABETH \n(FALTERING SLIGHTLY) Who was the man? \nFITZWILLIAM His closest friend. Mr Bingley. A silence. \nELIZABETH Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for this interference? \nFITZWILLIAM There were apparently strong objections to the lady. \nELIZABETH What kind of objections? Her lack of fortune? \nFITZWILLIAM I think it was her family that was considered unsuitable. \nELIZABETH So he separated them? \nFITZWILLIAM I believe so. I know nothing else. Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is joined by his aunt. \nELIZABETH I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well in finding partners suitable to their very high standards. Good morning, Col. Fitzwilliam. 76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76 parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a distance. \n72 EXT. ROSINGS PARK - DAY. 72 \nLizzie walks across the park - anywhere, she hardly cares. She is in a turmoil of misery and fury. How could Darcy do such a terrible thing! It starts to rain. \nCUT TO: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A Grecian summer house by the lake. The rain is now bucketing down. Lizzie hurries into the summer house and sits down, heavily, on a bench. Her poor sister; Lizzie gazes in despair at the rain- lashed landscape. A man approaches, across the park. He draws nearer. It's Darcy. Elizabeth stiffens. He's hurrying towards her. Sodden, breathless, he comes into the. summer house. He is in a state of agitation - far too agitated to notice her upset face. \nDARCY Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but I can bear it no longer ... . The past months have been a torment... He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in astonishment. He struggles on. \nDARCY I came to Rosings with the single object of seeing you...I had to see you... \nELIZABETH \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Me? \nDARCY \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I've fought against my better judgement, my family's expectation... \n(PAUSE) The inferiority of your birth.. .my rank and circumstance... \n(STUMBLINGLY) all those things.. .but I'm willing to put them aside... and ask you to end my agony... \nELIZABETH I don't understand... \nDARCY \n(WITH PASSION) I love you. Most ardently. Elizabeth stares at him. \nKITTY - and more so, because I'm two years older! Elizabeth looks to Jane. \nJANE Lydia has been invited to Brighton with the Foresters. \nMRS BENNET \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A little sea-bathing would set me up very \nNICELY- \nLYDIA I shall dine with the officers every night! An anguished wail from Kitty. \nMRS BENNET I'm sure I cried for two days when Colonel Millar's regiment went away. thought I should have broke my heart. \nLIZZIE Mother! Are you all mad? She glares at them, deeply upset -- by them, by everything. \n81 INT. THE GARDINERS' HOUSE - DAY. 81 \nElizabeth has found a quiet corner with her father. \nELIZABETH Please Papa, don't let her go! \nMR BENNET Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little inconvenience as under the present circumstances. \nELIZABETH (with great emotion) If you, dear father, will not take the trouble to check her, she will be fixed forever as the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made her family ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she always does. \nMR KENNET We shall have no peace until she goes. \nELIZABETH (really angry now) Peace! Is that all you care about? \nMR BENNET Colonel Forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief, and she is far too poor to be an object of prey to anyone. \nELIZABETH Father, its dangerous! - \nMR BENNET I'm sure the officers will find women better worth their while. Let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton will teach her her own insignificance. At any rate she can hardly grow any worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life. Elizabeth gazes at her father - will nothing touch him? He gave up on his daughter long ago. For this, just now, she hates him. \nELIZABETH No wonder our family is treated with contempt. She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks puzzled at her outburst. \n82 INT. DRAWING ROOM - CHEAPSIDE - THE SAME. 82 \nMr Bennet follows Elizabeth in. \nMR BENNET Well, at least the house will be quieter. \nELIZABETH I don't wish to be stuck with such a foolish family any longer, with your constant talk of men and marriages. Surely there is more to life. \nMRS GARDINER Lizzie dear, you would be very welcome to accompany us? \nMR GARDINER Oh yes. We plan to journey through the Peak District. You'd be most welcome. \nMARY Oh, the glories of nature! What are men, compared to rocks and mountains? \nELIZABETH Believe me, men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity. And if they're amiable they're so easily led that they have no minds of their own whatsoever. \nMRS GARDINER Take care, my love, that savours strongly of bitterness. \nELIZABETH No, they bring nothing but heartache. \n83 INT. BEDROOM - CHEAPSIDE - NIGHT. 83 \nAs usual Elizabeth and Jane share a bed. They lie next to each other in the darkness \nELIZABETH I saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings. \nJANE Why did you not tell me. Did he mention Mr Bingley. Pause. \nELIZABETH No. He did not. Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her sister. \n84 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DAY. 84 \nA ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty - scudding clouds, mountains, wild rocky outcrops. Elizabeth is walking freely, the wind in her hair. As she nears the peak of a promontory, Mr and Mrs Gardiner are below making their way towards her. They smile at her. She strides off determined to reach the very top. When she gets there she stands with her arms outstretched, her head back laughing into the wind. The view is magnificent. She breathes deeply. \n85 EXT. LAMBTON - DUSK. 85 \nAn establishing shot of Lambton, a charming market town. Through the window of an inn we see Elizabeth and Mr and Mrs Gardiner at a table. \n86 INT. INN - LAMBTON - NIGHT. 86 \nO In the inn, the Gardiner's and Elizabeth are eating supper. An air of high spirits. At the next table, another amiable tourist couple are also tucking into their food. \nMISS BINGLEY In six months I have never seen anyone so altered. How brown and coarse she has become! \nDARCY I perceive no alteration' except she is rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. \nMISS BINGLEY I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, you said \"she a beauty? I would have as soon called her mother a wit!\" \nDARCY You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even had I thought it, I would have couched it \nwith a little more finesse. Elizabeth looks across at Darcy - they smile at each other. \n95 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DUSK 95 \nDarcy is driving Elizabeth and the Gardiner's back to Lampton. The rugged landscape looks even more beautiful and dramatic in the dusk light. Elizabeth sits up with Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly at two large fish that lie beside him. \nELIZABETH It is so beautiful up here. I will be sorry to leave. Darcy smiles at her. \nELIZABETH You have been a most gracious host. I'm sure my aunt and uncle will talk of nothing else for days. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 DARCY I have recently thought a great deal about how I appear and act to others. \nShe smiles softly at Darcy. \nELIZABETH It does you credit, sir. \n96 INT. INN -- LAMBTON - NIGHT. 96 \nThe party arrive back at the inn. \nMR GARDINER (quietly to Elizabeth) What a capital fellow. \nMRS GARDINER Thank you so much Mr Darcy. Darcy is about to take his leave when a servant brings Elizabeth a letter. \nSERVANT \n(TO LIZZIE) For you, madam. \nELIZABETH \n(DELIGHTED) 107 Its from Jane. 10 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 she rips open the letter. \n97 INT. PARLOUR - INN - LAMBTON - THE SAME. 97 \nElizabeth is crying with the open letter in her hand. Darcy and Mr and Mrs Gardiner stand dumb, not quite knowing what to do. Elizabeth tries to speak but bursts into tears again. She cries for a long time. \nDARCY Miss Elizabeth. She cries on. \nDARCY (CONT'D) Miss Elizabeth. She eventually gathers herself. \nELIZABETH It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has run away - with Mr Wickham. They are gone together from Brighton to Lord knows where. She has no money, no connections, I fear she is lost forever. \nDARCY \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 (quietly to Elizabeth) This is my fault - if only I had exposed Wickham when I should. \nELIZABETH No, this is my fault. I might have prevented all of it by merely being open with my sisters rather than too proud with my knowledge. Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed. \nMRS GARDINER Has anything been done to recover her? \nELIZABETH Father has gone to London. But I know very well that nothing can be done. We have not the smallest hope. \nDARCY Would to heaven that anything could be said or done on my part that could offer consolation to such distress. \nELIZABETH Sir, it think it is too late. \nMR GARDINER I am afraid we must go at once - I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia before she ruins the family forever. \nDARCY I am so very sorry. This is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye. Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and then is gone. \n98 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT. 98 \nThe Gardiner's carriage racing through the night. \n99 INT. LONGBOURN - MRS BENNET'S BEDROOM - DAY. 99 \nElizabeth, Jane, Mary and Kitty are gathered around Mrs Bennet who has taken to her bed. \nMRS BENNET Why did the Foresters let her out of their sight? I always said they were unfit to have charge of her. \nMARY \nJANE It's to Daddy. It's in uncle's writing. Mr Bennet snatches the letter. \nMR BENNET As it is addressed to me... He tears it open and begins to read, squinting because he has forgotten his glasses. \nMR BENNET (CONT'D) He's found them. \nKITTY Are they married? \nMR BENNET (squinting at the letter) Just wait. I can't make out his script. \nElizabeth snatches it. \nELIZABETH Give it to me. (she reads) \nKITTY Are they married? \nELIZABETH They will be, if father will settle a hundred pounds a year on her. That is Wickham's condition. \nKITTY A hundred pounds! \nELIZABETH You will agree to this, father? The letter is passed around the other girls. \nMR BENNET Of course I will agree. But how much your uncle has laid on this wretched man already is anybody's guess. \nKITTY What do you mean, Father? \nMR BENNET No man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as a hundred a year. \nELIZABETH Ah, I see. \nJANE See what? \nMR BENNET Your uncle is very generous. \nELIZABETH Do you think it a large sum? \nMR BENNET Wickham's a fool if he takes her for less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very - beginning of our relationship. \nJANE Ten thousand! Heaven forbid! \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 107 INT. MR & MRS BENNET'S BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. It Close on Mrs Bennet's face as she springs out of bed. Pure triumphant joy. \nMRS BENNET Lydia married! And at sixteen too! Ring the bell, Kitty! I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas! Oh to see her face! And tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch! The other Bennet's are assembled. \nELIZABETH We should thank our uncle, Mama. \nMRS BENNET And so he should help! He's much richer than us, and he hasn't got any children. \nELIZABETH \n(ANGRILY) How can you talk like that? Her mother gets to her feet. \nMRS BENNET A daughter, married! \nELIZABETH Is that all you think about? \nMRS BENNET \"Mrs Wickham\" - how well it sounds \nELIZABETH \n(IN DESPERATION) You don't know what he's like \nMRS BENNET Now where will they live? Purvis Lodge might do. Ashworth is vacant of course, but it's too far off, I couldn't bear to have her ten miles from me - \nMR BENNET Before you take any of these houses, Mrs Bennet, let us be clear. Into one house she will never be welcome. Mrs Bennet stares at him. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 108 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - DAY. 108 \nLydia's triumphant face. The cat that's got the cream. She comes into the house with Wickham. Her mother kisses her, effusively. Mr Bennet coldly bows. \nLYDIA - and then we passed Sarah Sims in her carriage so I took off my glove and let my hand just rest on the window frame, so she might see the ring, and then 1 bowed and smiled like anything! Kitty shrieks with envy. Lizzie moves away; she cannot bear it. Wickham catches her eye, but she ignores him. \n109 INT. DINING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 109 \nThey are taking their seats for dinner. Lydia moves to the head of the table. \nLYDIA Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, for I am the married woman. She sits down and giggles at her sisters. The maid brings \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 in the food. Lydia holds up her hand, to display her ring to the maid. \nBINGLEY Damn and blast, oh buggery, damn. \n117 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 117 \nThe girls are now spread around the room. Jane in. despair. \nJANE Well, I'm glad that's over. We can now meet as indifferent acquaintances. \nELIZABETH \n(LAUGHING) Oh yes? Jane, take care. \nJANE You cannot think me so weak as to be in \ndanger now. \nELIZABETH I think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever. \nJANE I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr Darcy. \nELIZABETH \n(BLURTS OUT) Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I been in love, I could not have been more blind! \nJANE \n(STARES) What do you mean? The door bell rings. \nKITTY (at the window) It is him. He's back. He's come again. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A stunned reaction. \nCUT TO: \nEveryone has regained their decorous positions. They hear \nBingley's voice at the door and he comes in very awkwardly. He smiles. His face is crimson with embarrassment. \nBINGLEY I, erm, I know this is all very embarrassing, but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane - They all look at him. \nBINGLEY (CONT'D) - alone. \nMRS BENNET Girls. Everybody to the kitchen. Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so good to see you again so soon. She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other with extreme embarrassment. \nBINGLEY Miss Bennet, you have been the victim of a huge misunderstanding. Suffice to say, I have been an unmitigated and comprehensive ass. And therefore, I would like to ask you - \nCUT TO: \n118 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 118 \nMrs Bennet, Kitty, Mary and Mr Bennet are all jostling for a position at the door in order to overhear events inside. \nMARY Ssssshhh! Elizabeth is apart from her family. She cannot bear to be there. She walks down the corridor and out of the house into the garden. Through a window she sees Bingley on one knee, her eyes fill with tears as she walks away from the house. \n- CUT TO: \n119 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 119 \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Bingley looks at Jane, desperately worried. A pause. \nJANE \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Yes. A hundred times - yes. Mrs Bennet and the girls throw open the double doors to the drawing room and come crashing in. Bingley and Jane beam at them. \nMRS BENNET Thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen. \n120 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 120 \nElizabeth is sat under a tree crying. \n121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - OVER LOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 121 \nDarcy looks down at Longbourn. \n122 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 122 \nMr Bennet and Mrs Bennet are in bed. \nMR BENNET I am sure they will do well together, \ntheir tempers are much alike. They will be cheated assiduously by their servants, and be so generous with the rest, they will always exceed their income. \nELIZABETH Your Ladyship declared it to be impossible. \nLADY CATHERINE Let me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say? \nELIZABETH Only this - if that is the case you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me. \nLADY CATHERINE Oh obstinate girl! This union has been planned since their infancy. Do you think it can be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to his family? Whose own sister's elopement resulted in the scandalously patched-up marriage, only achieved at the expense of your uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him? \nELIZABETH I am not. \nLADY CATHERINE And will you promise never to enter into such an engagement? \nELIZABETH I will not. And I certainly never shall. Allow me to say, the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have, insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say. I must ask you to leave immediately. Good night. Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family outside. \nLADY CATHERINE I have never been thus treated in my entire life. Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement of having stood so firmly up for herself. \nMR BENNET Lizzie, what on earth is going on? \nELIZABETH Just a small misunderstanding. She walks past them to bed. \nMRS BENNET Lizzie! \nELIZABETH For once in your life. Just leave me alone. Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction. \n126 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 126 \nJane is fast asleep. Elizabeth unable to sleep. She quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room. \n127 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 127 \nElizabeth sits alone downstairs, thinking. Outside we see dawn is breaking. \n128 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAWN. 128 \nElizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around through the early morning mist, as the sun starts to rise. \n129 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE OVERLOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 129 \nElizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy. \nELIZABETH Mr Darcy! \nDARCY What are you doing out here so early? \nELIZABETH I could not sleep. \nDARCY Me neither. I have been up.most of the night. \nElizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy. \nELIZABETH Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your unexampled generosity to both my sisters. I know what kindnesses you have done for poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the happy resolution for Jane also. \nDARCY I am alarmed that you know of what I have been so in earnest to keep silent. But you must know that your happiness was one of my prime inducements. Elizabeth looks at Darcy. \nDARCY (CONT`D) I know you are too generous to trifle with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt last night, and it has taught me to hope as I had scarcely allowed myself before. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but \none word from you will silence me forever. \nElizabeth is silent. \nDARCY (CONT'D) If, however, your feelings have changed... Elizabeth gazes at him. \nDARCY (CONT'D) I would have to tell you, you have bewitched me body and soul and I love and love and love you. And never wish to be parted from you from this day on. Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's cheek. \nELIZABETH I am very happy to inform you that not only have my sentiments changed there are no other words which could give me greater pleasure. Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very, very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the kiss becomes passionate. \n130 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DUSK. 130 \nThe place is in an uproar. Bingley, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Mr and Mrs Bennet are all gathered, fretting terribly about Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts. \nMRS BENNET Lizzie, where have you been. We thought something had happened to you. Darcy follows Elizabeth in. \nMRS BENNET (CONT'D) Mr Darcy! What on earth are you doing here? Elizabeth takes Mr Darcy's hand. \nELIZABETH Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa. Everyone is stunned. \nCUT TO \n", "test1_input": "DARCY There was, however, I have to admit... the matter of your family - \nELIZABETH Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't vex himself about that! \nDARCY No, it was more than that. \nELIZABETH How, sir? \nDARCY (pause, very uncomfortable) It pains me to say this, but it was the lack of propriety shown by your mother, your three younger sisters - even, on occasion, your father. Forgive me. Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down. \nDARCY You and your sister -- I must exclude from this... Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery. \nELIZABETH And what about Mr Wickham? \nDARCY Mr Wickham? \nELIZABETH What excuse can you give for your behavior to him? \nDARCY You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns! \nELIZABETH He told me of his misfortunes. \nDARCY Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very great indeed! \nELIZABETH You have ruined his chances, and yet treat him with sarcasm? \nDARCY So this is your opinion of me! Thank you for explaining so fully. Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked, if your pride had not been hurt - \nELIZABETH My pride? \nDARCY - by my honesty in admitting scruples about our relationship. \n(MORE) \nDARCY (CONT'D) Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances? \nELIZABETH And those are the words of a gentleman? From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish distain of the feelings of others, made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry. Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence. \nDARCY Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time. He leaves, abruptly. Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears. \n73 INT. HUNSFORD - DAY. 73 \nElizabeth comes in soaked to the skin. Charlotte runs to her. \nCHARLOTTE Elizabeth! \nELIZABETH I was caught somewhat off-guard. \n74 INT. BEDROOM - HUNSFORD - THE SAME. 74 \nCharlotte attends to Elizabeth.who has changed and is drying her hair, a shawl around her shoulders. \nCHARLOTTE Shall I call the doctor? \nELIZABETH No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my apologies. You must not keep her waiting. Mr Collins clatters up the stairs. \nCOLLINS (popping his head around the \nDOOR) Come on. We shall be late! \nCharlotte leaves, reluctantly, and goes downstairs. \nCUT TO Later; The sound of the front door closing. Elizabeth sits down, heavily, on the bed. She walks downstairs and enters the drawing room. \n75 INT. DRAWING ROOM - HUNSFORD - DAY. 75 \nElizabeth is in the drawing room, she looks at a book on the table. It is Fordyce's Sermons. She puts it down and walks to the mirror and stares at herself. After a moment suddenly Darcy's face appears. She freezes. They stare at each other without speaking. Finally... \nDARCY I came to leave you this. He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth does not turn but watches him through the mirror. \nDARCY (CONT'D) I'm not going to renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you, but to address the two offenses you have laid against me. I had not long been in Hertfordshire before I saw that Bingley \npreferred your eldest sister. I observed my friend's behaviour attentively and I could perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I have ever witnessed in him. Elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at Darcy. She stares at her own reflection as he speaks. \nDARCY (CONT'D) Yet when I observed your sister .1 detected no symptom of peculiar regard, and witnessed only the families coarse appetite for having their daughters married favorably. And so in London, perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of the unfitness of the match citing your sisters coolness towards him. We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection. \nDARCY (CONT'D) It was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you appear naturally insufficient, they were done to protect a friend. As to the other \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 more serious matter.. \n", "test1_true": "DARCY (V.0.) (CONT'D) \"My father provided for Mr Wickham a valuable living. Elizabeth tears open the envelope, her hands shaking, and reads the letter, as Darcy's voice carries on. \nDARCY (V.0.) (CONT'D) \"But upon his death, however, Mr Wickham told me that he had no intention of taking orders and would I recompense him to the tune of \u00c2\u00a33000 so he could go to town and study the law. We circle Elizabeth as she reads. \nDARCY (CONT'D) (V.0.) \n(CONT'D) This I did, though by now I had some doubts about his character. These were confirmed by reports that he had sunk into a life of idleness, gambling and dissipation. The money was soon used up, whereupon he wrote demanding more money which I refused, whereupon he severed all \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 ACQUAINTANCE\" Holding the letter she looks out of the window to see Darcy riding away. \nDARCY (CONT'D) \"But last summer he was unwillingly obtruded on my notice when he connived a relationship with my sister whom he persuaded to be in love with him and made her consent to an elopement. She was but fifteen. \n76 EXT. HUNSFORD - DAY. 76 \nDarcy rides off. \nDARCY (V.0.) Mr Wickham's prime objective was her inheritance of thirty thousand pounds but hope of revenging me was a strong inducement. I was lucky enough to persuade my sister of her folly. I hope this goes someway to mitigating my behaviour in your eyes. If you doubt my word please have it confirmed by my \ncousin Fitzwilliam. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 77 INT. DRAWING ROOM -- HUNSFORD - LATER - DAY 7 \nElizabeth with the letter. Charlotte walks in. Elizabeth is shaking. \nCHARLOTTE Lizzy: Are you alright? \nELIZABETH I do not know. I hardly know myself. Elizabeth looks at Charlotte utterly shaken. \n78 TNT/EXT. CARRIAGE/CHEAPSIDE - DAY. 78 \nElizabeth riding in a carriage through Cheapside, reading the letter. \nDARCY (V.0.) P.S. As we shall never meet again, I wish you all happiness in the future. Elizabeth looks out at the high warehouse building and the bustle of trade. There is no horizon. is 79 INT. GARDINERS HOUSE - CHEAPSIDE - DAY. 7 Mrs Gardiner, the girls' kindly aunt, is taking Elizabeth's coat from her. \nMRS GARDINER How fortunate, you are here just in time to catch everybody coming through from Longbourn. \nELIZABETH How is Jane? Mrs Gardiner smiles sadly. \nMRS GARDINER She is outside. Through a window Elizabeth sees Jane sitting quietly alone at her needle work. \nCUT TO: \n80 EXT. SMALL BACK GARDEN OF THE GARDINERS' HOUSE - E \nCHEAPSIDE - THE SAME. Elizabeth and Jane sit together in the small walled garden. \nJane is all smiles, but behind her eyes is a sadness unseen before. Elizabeth is desperate to unburden herself \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 but feels unable. \nJANE I am quite over him, Lizzie. If he passed in the street I would hardly notice. London is so diverting... \nELIZABETH oh Jane... \nJANE Its true! What with the theatre and... But tell me, what news from Kent? \nELIZABETH Nothing. Everything as you might imagine. Elizabeth tries to smile. There is a crash as all the Bennet's arrive at the house. Kitty rushes into the garden crying her eyes out, she is followed by Lydia and Mrs Bennet. \nKITTY Lizzie, tell mama, tell her! \nLYDIA \n(SMUGLY) \nMrs Forster has invited me. \nKITTY \n(WAILS) Why didn't she ask me as well? \nELIZABETH Kitty, what's happened? \nLYDIA - because she likes me better. \nKITTY I've just as much right as Lydia - \nMRS BENNET Oh, if I could but go to Brighton - \n", "test2_input": "MRS GARDINER A handsome face. Lizzie, is it a true likeness of him? \nMRS REYNOLDS Does this young lady know Mr Darcy? \nELIZABETH Only a little. \nMRS REYNOLDS And do you not think him a handsome man, Miss? \nELISABETH \n(THOUGHTFULLY) Yes, yes I suppose he is. Mrs Reynolds moves the Gardiners on to another painting, but Elizabeth stays, staring at Darcy's image. \nMRS REYNOLDS And this is his sister, Miss Georgians. She plays and sings all day long. We realize that in the distance we have heard music. Elizabeth is still gazing at the portrait of Darcy, then suddenly snaps out of her reverie, as she processes Mrs \nREYNOLDS SPEECH: \nELIZABETH \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 They are at home?! \nMRS REYNOLDS Miss Darcy is always down for the summer. Mr Darcy is due here tomorrow. \nMR GARDINER Is your master much at Pemberley? \nMRS REYNOLDS Not as much as I would wish, sir, or he -- for he dearly loves it here. Relaxed again Elizabeth wanders off as the Gardiners talk to Mrs Reynolds. \nMRS GARDINER If he should marry, you might see more of him. \nMRS REYNOLDS Yes madam, but I do not know when that will be. I do not know a lady who is good enough for him. \nMRS GARDINER What do you mean? \nMRS REYNOLDS I've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy. He was always a kind and generous person even then. Not everyone can see it, because he does not make a meal of it like a lot of young men nowadays. But he is the most sweet-tempered and kind- hearted man I have ever known. \nCUT TO: As the Gardiners look at more paintings, Elizabeth drifts out through the open doors and onto a terrace. In the bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond is exquisite. Outside the music we heard before is louder. \n92 EXT. TERRACE - PEMBERLY - THE SAME. 92 \nElizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she is outside the room where the music is being played. \nShe steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the better of her and she discretely peeps in. \nThrough the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes. Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face. It is Darcy. Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him. For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure, Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her. \nDARCY Miss Bennet! Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches up with her. They both blush, deeply. \nELIZABETH I thought you were in London. \nDARCY \n(STUPIDLY) No... I'm not. \nELIZABETH No. Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once. \nDARCY ELIZABETH I came here a day early - We wouldn't have come - \nDARCY ELIZABETH -- some business with my I'm so terribly sorry - \nSTEWARD - They stop. He gazes at her with great emotion. \nELIZABETH I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and aunt. \nDARCY (trying to recover) And are you having a pleasant trip? \nELIZABETH Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock. \nDARCY \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Tomorrow? \n(DISAPPOINTED) Are you staying at Larnbton? \nELIZABETH Yes. At the Rose and Crown. Another pause. She extends her hand. \nELIZABETH I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea... She shakes his hand and starts to walk away. \nDARCY May I see you to the village? \nELIZABETH Oh no! I'm very fond of walking. \nDARCY Yes. \n", "test2_true": "She hurries away. He gazes after her. \nCUT TO: A wood. Now she is out of sight Lizzie collapses on a log. She is utterly undone. Around her, the birds sing. \n93 INT. INN -- NIGHT. 93 \nIt's that night. Lizzie comes downstairs, for supper. And stops. Through a gap in the door to the restaurant she sees Mr Darcy talking to her aunt and uncle. \nDARCY - I shall send my carriage at noon After a moment Darcy leaves and Elizabeth approaches the table. \n0 MRS GARDINER Lizzie, I've just met Mr Darcy! Why didn't you tell us you had seen him? He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow - He was very civil, was he not? \nMR GARDINER Very civil. \nMRS GARDINER \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Not at all like you painted him. \nELIZABETH \n(STARES) To dine with him? \nMRS GARDINER - there is something pleasing about his mouth, when he speaks. \nMR GARDINER You don't mind delaying our journey for another day? Elizabeth shakes her head, dumbly. \nMRS GARDINER He particularly wishes you to meet his sister. \nELIZABETH His sister? \n94 INT. LIBRARY AND DRAWING ROOM -- PEMBERLEY - DAY. 94 \nA footman escorts Elizabeth and the Gardiner's through the stupendous library. From the drawing room, the sound of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully. Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel her heart racing. The footman opens the double doors to reveal the magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite smile falters. Darcy's sister Georgiana plays the piano. She jumps up and hurries over. \nDARCY My sister, Miss Darcy... They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl. \nGEORGIANA Miss Elizabeth, my brother has told me so much about you. I feel as if we are friends already. \nELIZABETH What a beautiful instrument. \nGEORGIANA My brother gave it to me. (smiles at him) He shouldn't have. \nDARCY \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Yes I should. \nGEORGIANA Oh very well then. \nDARCY She's easily persuaded, is she not? They gaze at each other with affection. Miss Bingley approaches. \nMISS BINGLEY \n(SMALL SMILE) What a surprise, Miss Bennet, to see you in Derbyshire. \nELIZABETH \n(SMALL NOD) Your brother is well, I trust? \nMISS BINGLEY Very well. He hopes to come here soon. (significant glance at \nGEORGIANA) Pemberley has a special attraction for him. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 ELIZABETH \n(SWEETLY) Yes, the library is particularly splendid, is it not? A small silence. Darcy, uneasy at their conversation, approaches. \nMISS BINGLEY And how is your family, Miss Bennet? Someone told me the militia are removed from Meryton. \n(SIGNIFICANT SMILE) They must be a great loss for some of you Darcy comes to the rescue. \nDARCY Your uncle is fond of fishing, I hear. \nELIZABETH Yes, very. \nDARCY (drawing her away) Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this afternoon? \n(MORE) \nDARCY (CONT'D) For the lake here is very well stocked and its occupants left in peace for far \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 too long. Elizabeth smiles, surprised and delighted. And grateful to be rescued. What does Mr Darcy mean by this? She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves closer to Darcy. \n", "test3_input": "(LOW VOICE) Why was Mr Darcy there? \nLYDIA I'm not supposed to tell. Lizzie abandons her pride. She takes Lydia's hand. \nELIZABETH Please, Lydia! \nLYDIA Because he paid for it. \nELIZABETH \n(STARES) For what? \nLYDIA \n(CARELESSLY) The wedding, Wickham's commission. Everything. \nELIZABETH Everything? \nKITTY \n(CALLS) Lydia! It's your turn! Lydia moves to go. \nLYDIA People kept saying Wickham owed them money, it was so tedious. So Darcy settled his debts but I don't really like him, do you? Lizzie pulls her back. \nELIZABETH But why did he do it? \nLYDIA \n(SHRUGS) I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to tell because it's supposed to be our uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 minded paying, either, because I'm his favorite. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 She leaves. Giggles and shrieks from the croquet lawn. Elizabeth looks blank with shock. \n111 EXT. BINGLEY'S HOUSE - MAYFAIR -- DAY. 111 \nClose on Darcy's grimly determined face. Drawing back, we see that he is walking down a street in Mayfair. He arrives at a house, pauses, and rings the bell. The door is opened. \nBUTLER Mr Darcy. \nDARCY I have some business with Mr Bingley. Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has wronged Jane Bennet. \n112 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 112 \nIS Lydia and Wickham are leaving. Mr Bennet stands at a distance. Mrs Bennet sobs as Lydia climbs onto the carriage. \nMRS BENNET Write to me often, my dear'. Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth. \nWICKHAM Please relay my affections to the Darcy's on your next acquaintance. I am sure he will be pleased to hear things have worked out so well. He joins Lydia. \nLYDIA (through the window) Married women never have much time for writing. My sisters may write to me! They'll have nothing else to do. The Mrs Bennet and the girls watch as the carriage drives away. \nMRS BENNET \nOh there is nothing so bad as parting with ones children! One seems so forlorn without them. \nELIZABETH That is the consequence of marrying a daughter. It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single. \n113 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 113 \nElizabeth and Jane are out shopping with their mother and sisters. Their housekeeper, Mrs Hill, comes out of the butchers shop. \nMRS HILL Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield. A stunned silence. Lizzie glances at Jane. She blushes. \nMRS BENNET Mr Bingley? Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop. \nMRS HILL Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork, for she expects him tomorrow. \nMRS BENNET Tomorrow? \n(RECOVERING) Not that I care about it. Mr Bingley is nothing to us and I'm sure I never want to see him again. \n(MOVES AWAY) No, we shall not mention a word about it. (comes back to Mrs Hill) Is it quite certain he is coming? \nMRS HILL Yes, madam. I believe he is alone; his sister remains in town. \nMRS BENNET Huh! Come along, girls. Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at the threshold. \nJANE \n", "test3_true": "(BLUSHING) Not that I'm afraid of myself, but I dread other people's remarks. A brave smile. Lizzie, of course, is not convinced in the slightest. They go into the shop. \n114 EXT. LONGBOURN -- DAY. 114 \nMr Bingley rides towards Longbourn, a look of slight trepidation in his eyes. Darcy now comes into view riding along side him. They cross the moat bridge. \n115 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- DAY. 115 \nMary is practising her scales. Jane and Elizabeth are sitting at their work, with their mother. Kitty rushes in. \nKITTY He is here! He is here, he's at the door! \nMRS BENNET Oh my goodness! Everybody act naturally. Jane completely freezes. Everybody else goes into a fluster. \nMRS BENNET (CONT'D) Whatever you do, do not appear overbearing. Kitty looks out through a window. \nKITTY Look. There's someone with him. Mr whats his name. The pompous one from before. Elizabeth looks through the window at Darcy, her heart leaps to her mouth. \nMRS BENNET Mr Darcy indeed! The very insolence of 0 0 it. What does he think of coming here? Elizabeth returns to her seat and sits down, heavily. Mrs Bennet hurries over to Jane and pinches her cheeks. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 JANE Mama! \nMRS BENNET \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 (to Mary - who is still \nPLAYING) Stop that and sit down! Find yourself some work! Oh Lord. They sit there, frozen, pretending to sew. The drawing room door opens and Mrs Hill shows in the two men. They bow. Bingley smiles warmly at Jane, who blushes. Elizabeth glances at Darcy. His face is strained. Mrs Bennet is all smiles for Bingley. She ignores Darcy. \nMRS BENNET (CONT'D) How very glad we are to see you, Mr Bingley! There are a great many changes since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters too, you will have seen it in the papers though it was not put in as it ought to have been. Very short, nothing about her family. \nBINGLEY \n(SMILES) I did hear of it, and offer my congratulations. \nMRS BENNET - but it's very hard to have my Lydia taken away from me. Mr Wickham has been transferred to Newcastle, where ever that is. Thank heaven he has some friends. Mrs Bennet shoots a frosty glance at Mr Darcy. This is more than Elizabeth can bare. \nELIZABETH Do you hope to stay long in the country, Mr Bingley? \nBINGLEY Just a few weeks. For the shooting. \nMRS BENNET When you have killed all your own birds, Mr Bingley, I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please. \nMR BINGLEY Thank you - \nMRS BENNET - Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the covies for you. \nMR BINGLEY \nExcellent. \nELIZABETH Are you well, Mr Darcy? \nDARCY Quite well, thank you. \nELIZABETH Well, I hope the weather stays fine, for your sport. \nDARCY I return to town tomorrow. \nELIZABETH \n(A PAUSE) So soon? \nMRS BENNET My Jane looks well, does she not? Mr-Bingley stands up abruptly. \nBINGLEY She does indeed. Well, I must be going, I suppose. Darcy - Darcy cannot quite believe it. He gives Bingley a harsh stare, Bingley has not completed his task. \nBINGLEY (CONT`D) It was very pleasant to see you all again. Elizabeth, Miss Jane.. Bingley can almost not bear to look Jane in the eye as he acknowledges them all very briefly and bolts for the door. Mrs Bennet fusses around him. \nMRS BENNET You must come again. For when you were in town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us. I have not forgot you see. At least three courses. Bingley and Darcy take their leave, leaving the Bennets sitting in silence all looking at once another. Kitty is fit to burst out laughing, Elizabeth and Jane horrified by the awkward visit. \n116 EXT. THE LANE - NEAR LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 116 \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Bingley is pacing backwards and forwards in despair muttering to himself. Darcy looks at him in extreme frustration. \nBINGLEY Oh damn, damn, buggery, damn. \nDARCY What were you thinking of? It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and down. \n"}

She blows out the candle. \n8 INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 8 \nMrs Bennet presides over breakfast with an endless description of the ball. Mary is doing some needle work, whilst Lydia, Kitty and Jane blearily eat. \nMRS BENNET And then he danced the third with Miss Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss King of little standing. And the fifth again with Jane. \nMR BENNET \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If he'd had any compassion for me he would have sprained his ankle in the first dance. \nMRS BENNET Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the girls looked forward to a grand inheritance. Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this speech many times before. \nMR BENNET \n(NOT LISTENING) Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter. \nMRS BENNET As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you die, which may in fact be very soon, our girls will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny to their name. \nELIZABETH Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the morning. Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 babbling. \nMRS HILL \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A letter addressed to Miss Bennet, Ma'arn. From Netherfield Hall. \nMRS BENNET Praise the Lord! We are saved. Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane. \nMRS BENNET (CONT'D) Make haste, Jane, make haste. 0 happy day! \nJANE It is from Miss Bingley. Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks. \nJANE (CONT'D) She has invited me to dine with her. \n(PAUSE) Her brother will be dining out. \nMRS BENNET This is most unfortunate. \nLYDIA I didn't think he was so good looking anyway. \nJANE Can I take the carriage? \nMRS BENNET Certainly not my dear, you will go to Netherfield on horse back. \nJANE Horseback?!

FIELD - DAY. 10 \nAn open book. Plop plop! Raindrops fall on it. Drawing back, we see Lizzie walking through a field, reading. She looks up to the sky... \n11 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 11 \nMrs Bennet stands at the kitchen door. A boy is delivering meat. It starts to rain. She puts out her hand, to check. \nMRS BENNET (smiles, satisfied) Ah, good... The housekeeper, Mrs Hill, who is with her, looks bemused at her mistress's reaction. \n12 EXT. GARDEN - DAY. 12 \nA louder rumble of thunder. A washerwoman hastily pulls clothes from a line...it's bucketing down heavily now... \n13 EXT.

Mr Bennet laughs. \nELIZABETH I am going to Netherfield at once. \nMRS BENNET Nonsense, the horse is with Jane. And the girls took the carriage to town. \nELIZABETH Then I will walk there. We should not leave Jane alone in her condition. \nMRS BENNET Walk! You will not be fit to be seen by the time you get there. \nMR BENNET Why the devil not. We could have them all laid up at Netherfield Hall. \nELIZABETH I will be fit for Jane which is all I care about. \n17 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY. 17 \nElizabeth strides across vast muddy fields, slipping as she goes. Netherfield is in view on the horizon. She stops to take it in, then carries on down an even more muddy track. \n18 INT. NETHERFIELD -- BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY. \nIn the large grand dining room Caroline Bingley and Darcy are eating breakfast. \nIts very formal, in fact frigid, compared to the volatile Bennet household. Darcy is reading the \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 newspaper; Caroline Bingley is reading a letter. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY (puts down the letter) Apparently, Lady Bathurst is redecorating her ballroom in the French style. A little unpatriotic, don't you think? Mr Darcy is about to answer when the door opens. A footman appears, his face rigid with disapproval. \nFOOTMAN Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzie comes in, her face flushed, her skirt covered in mud. She looks ravishing. Darcy stares at her, then quickly rises to his feet. Caroline Bingley, astonished, looks her up and down. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Good Lord, Miss Bennet. Have you walked here? \nELIZABETH I'm so sorry. How is my sister? \nDARCY \n(MORE KINDLY) She's upstairs. \n(TO FOOTMAN) Show Miss Bennet the way, Alfred. Lizzie leaves. A beat. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Goodness, did you see her petticoat? Six inches deep in mud! No response. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY And her hair, so blowsy and untidy! \nDARCY I think her concern for her sister does her credit. A little pause, Caroline recovers. \nCAROLINE BINGLEY Oh yes, its shocking to have a bad cold. I dislike excessively being ill myself. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 19 INT. NETHERFIELD LANDING - DAY. I \nElizabeth is taken upstairs. Bingley, looking tense, waits outside her sister's room. His face lights up when he sees her. \nBINGLEY Miss Elizabeth! Oh I'm so glad to see you A doctor comes out of Jane's room. \nELIZABETH AND BINGLEY \n(TOGETHER) How is she? \nDOCTOR A violent cold, but we shall get the better of it. \n20 INT. NETHERFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM - DAY. 20 \nElizabeth goes into the bedroom where Jane lies in bed, feverish and ill. \n", "test1_id": 1014, "test2_input": "WICKHAM (CONT'D) You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, especially given the cold manner of our intimacy this afternoon. Are you well acquainted with that gentleman? \nELIZABETH As much as I could ever wish to be. I have spent four days in the same house as him, and I think him very disagreeable. \nWICKHAM I cannot pretend to be sorry. Elizabeth blushes. \nWICKHAM But really I speak out of turn. Collins voice breaks the moment. \nCOLLINS Miss Elizabeth, I was just saying to Sir William what appalling weather we've been having. \nElizabeth cannot believe her misfortune in Mr Collins, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 but she smiles politely. \nELIZABETH I think I shall take a little air. She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony. As she passes the other tables we follow and witness snippets of their conversations. \nCHARLOTTE \n(TO MARY) It seems Mr Wickham has met with universal approval. Though Lizzie looks singularly pleased with him. \nMARY At the moment she has more suitors than sense. Charlotte looks over at Mr Collins. Elizabeth passes Sir William's side of the table. \nSIR WILLIAM Now any one for a round of bridge? Elizabeth? \nELIZABETH \nReally I need to take some air. Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth. \nSIR WILLIAM Mr Collins? \nCOLLINS Oh, I am not so familiar with the game, Sir William. \nSIR WILLIAM Absolute nonsense. I insist that you join us. \nCHARLOTTE Please, Mr Collins, I'd be happy if you'd \nPARTNER ME_ Collins resigns himself to his fate. Elizabeth smiles and slips out into the night air. \n44 EXT. BALCONY - THE LUCASES HOUSE - MERYTON - NIGHT. 44 \nElizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses someone join her. She looks round to see Wickham has followed her as she had hoped. \nELIZABETH \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I hope your plans in favor of Meryton will not be affected by your difficult relations with the gentleman we were just speaking of. \nWICKHAM Oh no - it is not for me to be driven away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go not I. Pause. \nELIZABETH I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy? \nWICKHAM Do you really want to hear? Lizzie nods. \nWICKHAM He ruined me. She stares at him. \nELIZABETH How so? \nWICKHAM My father managed his estate. We grew up together, Darcy and I. His father treated me like a second son. Oh he was the kindest of men and bequeathed me the best living in his gift, for I had my heart set on joining the church. But when he died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave the living to another man. \nLIZZIE Why did he do that? \nWICKHAM Out of jealousy, for his father loved me more than he loved him. \nLIZZIE How cruel! Are you sure? \nWICKHAM \n(NODS) And out of pride, for he considered me too lowly to be worth his consideration. \nPause. Lizzie gazes at him with horror and sympathy. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 45 INT. BEDROOMS - LONGBOURNE - THE SAME. 45 \nWe pan through the bedrooms as the Bennet girls prepare for the Netherfield ball. Kitty is helping Lydia into her dress, they are both wearing white. \nLYDIA Aggghh! \nKITTY Breathe in! We move to the quieter preparations of Jane and Elizabeth. This conversation has been going on for some time. \nJANE \n(HORRIFIED) - I still think there must have been a misunderstanding. \n", "test2_true": "(EXASPERATED LAUGH) Oh Jane, do you never think ill of anybody? \nJANE 0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I will discover the truth from Mr Bingley at the ball this evening. \nELIZABETH If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict it himself. But until he does, I hope never to encounter him. \nJANE Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham. \nELIZABETH On the contrary, he is twice the man Darcy is. \nJANE And lets hope for you a rather more willing dancer. Jane leaves Elizabeth, at the mirror, taking very particular care of her makeup. she smil6s to herself. \n46 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - NIGHT. 46 \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The great doors of Netherfield open to reveal the ball in full swing. Compared to the somewhat clod-hopping Assembly, its a dazzling affair. \nThere are hundreds of guests. All the women, roughly two hundred, are dressed in white. The men are either in red \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 officer uniform or dressed in black and white. There are a number of rooms each occupied by a different activity, cards, buffet, women's closet. The final and grandest room is the ball room, a swirl of elegant dance. The Bennet's enter the first reception room, the girls, including Mrs Bennet, are all dressed in white. Mr Collins is slightly detained as people pass. Mr Bingley bounds up to Jane. \nBINGLEY You're here! I'm so pleased. \nJANE And so am I. \nBINGLEY How are you, Miss Elizabeth? Elizabeth is not paying attention, instead she is searching over Mr Bingleys' shoulder for a sight of Wickham. \nBINGLEY Are you, looking for someone? \nELIZABETH \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor of the ball. \nJANE It is lovely, Mr Bingley. Bingley and Jane move off leaving Elizabeth with Mrs Bennet and others. While Mrs Bennet talks we focus on Elizabeth searching the sea of red coats. \nMRS BENNET (refering to Jane and \nBINGLEY) I dare say I have never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my years. Look how he dotes on her! Still Jane has always done what is best for her family. Elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the next room. Elizabeth looks around but cannot see Mr Wickham. Suddenly she thinks she sees him, so starts to a r, move over. The man turns round, it is not Wickham but someone else. Elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room, again looking for Mr Wickham. She cranes around trying to see \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 him then she is suddenly surprised by Charlotte Lucas. \nELIZABETH \nHave you seen Mr Wickham. She shakes her head. \nCHARLOTTE Perhaps he is in the ballroom. They both walk into the ball room. We pull back to reveal a sea of dancers. Wickham is nowhere to be seen. Jane appears and catches Elizabeths arm. \nJANE He's not here. Apparently otherwise detained. The disappointment is palpable on Elizabeth's face. \nELIZABETH Detained? Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at Elizabeth. \nCOLLINS There you are. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 ELIZABETH Mr Collins. What a pleasant surprise. \nMR COLLINS Perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss Elizabeth? \nELIZABETH Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr Collins. \nMR COLLINS I do not consider it incompatible with the office of a clergyman to indulge in such an innocent diversion. Elizabeth tries to smile, politely. \nMR COLLINS (CONT'D) In fact several people, her ladyship included, have complimented me on my lightness of foot. Elizabeth's face is a matey rictus. \nCUT TO: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 They dance, the style of which is not unlike English Country dancing. \nCOLLINS \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 To be sure, dancing is of little consequence to me, but it does afford the opportunity to lavish'ones partner with delicate attentions which is my primary object of the evening. Elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she dances beside Jane. \nJANE Apparently Your Mr Wickham has been called on some business to town, though my informer told me he would have been less inclined to be engaged had it not been for the presence at Netherfield of a certain gentleman. Jane indicates towards where Darcy stands watching them. \nELIZABETH That gentleman barely warrants the name. The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins. \nCOLLINS (CONT`D) It is my intention, if I may be so bold to remain close to you throughout the evening. \nCUT TO: Couples are preparing for the next dance. Elizabeth and Charlotte are standing to one side when Mr Darcy approaches. \nDARCY May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth. Elizabeth is stunned. \nELIZABETH You may. Darcy walks away. \nELIZABETH What was I thinking? Have I no presence of mind?l \nCHARLOTTE I dare say you will find him very agreeable, Lizzie. \n", "test2_id": 1015, "test3_input": "ELIZABETH He is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him. Darcy sits down. \nELIZABETH Shall I call for some tea? \nDARCY No. Thankyou. The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up. \nDARCY Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a pleasure. He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused and intrigued. \nCUT TO: Charlotte, in the hallway, taking off her bonnet. Darcy hurries past her, with a swift bow, and leaves abruptly. Charlotte gazes after him in surprise. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Charlotte heads to the drawing room where she finds Elizabeth sitting, bemused. \nCHARLOTTE What on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy? \nELIZABETH. I have no idea. 73 She truly doesn't. Charlotte gives Elizabeth a look 73 \n71 EXT. HUNSFORD CHURCH - DAY. 71 \nSunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the \" church. Mr Collins, in his vestments, obeises himself to Lady Catherine, who is sweeping out with her miserable- looking daughter and downtrodden governess. Elizabeth joins Colonel Fitzwilliam. They walk down the path together. \nELIZABETH How long do you plan to stay in Kent, Colonel? \nFITZWILLIAM As long as Darcy chooses. I am at his disposal. \nELIZABETH I do imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly to have someone to order around. I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind. \nFITZWILLIAM She would be a lucky woman. \nELIZABETH Really? \nFITZWILLIAM Darcy is a most loyal companion. From what I heard, on our journey here, he recently came to the rescue of one of his friends just in time. Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops, at the churchyard gate. \nELIZABETH What happened? \nFITZWILLIAM He saved the man from an imprudent marriage. \nELIZABETH \n(FALTERING SLIGHTLY) Who was the man? \nFITZWILLIAM His closest friend. Mr Bingley. A silence. \nELIZABETH Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for this interference? \nFITZWILLIAM There were apparently strong objections to the lady. \nELIZABETH What kind of objections? Her lack of fortune? \nFITZWILLIAM I think it was her family that was considered unsuitable. \nELIZABETH So he separated them? \nFITZWILLIAM I believe so. I know nothing else. Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is joined by his aunt. \nELIZABETH I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well in finding partners suitable to their very high standards. Good morning, Col. Fitzwilliam. 76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76 parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a distance. \n72 EXT. ROSINGS PARK - DAY. 72 \nLizzie walks across the park - anywhere, she hardly cares. She is in a turmoil of misery and fury. How could Darcy do such a terrible thing! It starts to rain. \nCUT TO: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A Grecian summer house by the lake. The rain is now bucketing down. Lizzie hurries into the summer house and sits down, heavily, on a bench. Her poor sister; Lizzie gazes in despair at the rain- lashed landscape. A man approaches, across the park. He draws nearer. It's Darcy. Elizabeth stiffens. He's hurrying towards her. Sodden, breathless, he comes into the. summer house. He is in a state of agitation - far too agitated to notice her upset face. \nDARCY Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but I can bear it no longer ... . The past months have been a torment... He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in astonishment. He struggles on. \nDARCY I came to Rosings with the single object of seeing you...I had to see you... \nELIZABETH \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Me? \nDARCY \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I've fought against my better judgement, my family's expectation... \n(PAUSE) The inferiority of your birth.. .my rank and circumstance... \n(STUMBLINGLY) all those things.. .but I'm willing to put them aside... and ask you to end my agony... \nELIZABETH I don't understand... \nDARCY \n(WITH PASSION) I love you. Most ardently. Elizabeth stares at him. \n", "test3_true": "ELIZABETH \n(VOICE SHAKING) Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have been through, and I am very sorry to have caused you pain. Believe me, it was unconsciously done. A silence. Gathering her shawl, she gets to her feet. \nDARCY \n(STARES) Is this your reply? \nELIZABETH Yes, sir. \nDARCY Are you laughing at me? \nELIZABETH No? \nDARCY Are you rejecting me? \nELIZABETH \n(PAUSE) I'm sure that the feelings which, as you've told me, have hindered your regard, will help you in overcoming it. \nA terrible silence, as this sinks in. Neither of them can \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 move. At last, Darcy speaks. He is very pale. \nDARCY Might I ask why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus repulsed? \nELIZABETH (trembling with emotion) I might as well enquire why, with so. evident a design of insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your better judgement. If I was uncivil, that was some excuse - \nDARCY Believe me, I didn't mean - \nELIZABETH But I have other reasons, you know I have! \nDARCY What reasons? \nELIZABETH Do you think that anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister? Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the face. \nELIZABETH Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you separated a young couple who loved each other, exposing your friend to the censure of the world for caprice, and my sister to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind? \nDARCY I do not deny it. \nELIZABETH \n(BLURTS OUT) How could you do it? \nDARCY Because I believed your sister indifferent to him. \nELIZABETH \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Indifferent? \nDARCY \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I watched them most carefully, and realized his attachment was much deeper than hers. \nELIZABETH That's because she's shy! \nDARCY Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded that she didn't feel strongly for him. \nELIZABETH Because you suggested it! \nDARCY I did it for his own good. \nELIZABETH My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me! (pause, takes a breath) I suppose you suspect that his fortune had some bearing on the matter? \nDARCY \n(SHARPLY) No! I wouldn't do your sister the \ndishonour. Though it was suggested - \n(STOPS) \nELIZABETH What was? \nDARCY It was made perfectly clear that-an advantageous marriage... \n(STOPS) \nELIZABETH Did my sister give that impression? \nDARCY - No! An awkward pause. \n", "test3_id": 1016}

MAN Can't you find a woman, Hector... Hector smiles. He isn't surprised to see them. They are only doing what he and Thalia do on the roof. The Slaves have their meeting places scattered all over the house. HECTOR Sorry to trouble you... just fetching a chicken... good night ... the roof's free... The Man shakes his head with a smile. Hector leaves, the sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms. HECTOR Come on, miss, you can tell Lucinnius his future. 
33   EXT. STREET - MORNING                                       33 Hector and Lucinnius are approaching the home of Cyprian. Hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master, and he carries a large satchel of documents. Cyprian's home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but there is already activity around the house, visitors coming and going, messengers, petitioners. A few impor- tant callers arrive in litters, carried by slaves. Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius's hopes of quietly bending Cyprian's ear are dashed. It seems as if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial Mr. Big. 
34   EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING                                    34 The slaves gather on one side of the courtyard, gossiping and playing games of chance on the ground. Their masters wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on benches along the wall. Cyprian's aides usher the visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds. 
Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius, like a mother watching her child from a distance on its first day at school. (CONTINUED) 
34   CONTINUED:                                                     34 Lucinnius, sitting expectantly in line, does look a little pathetic, even ridiculous. Straight-backed, hands on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri- ficial offering himself. Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by place to the front of the line. We almost expect Hector to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits. The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door. One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian. 
Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad smile on his face. Hector relaxes and leaves the ball game to join him. HECTOR You look happier. 
LUCINNIUS Relieved anyway... relieved that it's over at last. Lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with Hector following after him. 
35   EXT. STREETS - DAY                                             35 
Lucinnius and Hector are walking home in their usual formation. Hector is closer than normal, so that they can talk. 
HECTOR Will he help you? 
LUCINNIUS I have to kill myself by tomorrow morning. He has all my letters to Titinius, none of them got through. He says it's like treason... and he says I should want to die for owing him half a million anyway... 
Hector is shocked. 
HECTOR What if you don't... 
(CONTINUED) 
35   CONTINUED:                                                     35 LUCINNIUS Then he will... and that wouldn't be pleasant... he would drag me to Rome... those letters... Lucinnius shivers to think of them. 
LUCINNIUS I'm done for, Hector... but it's strange... I feel kind of good about it... the struggle is over ... we've seen it through together, eh? HECTOR I don't know what to say. 
LUCINNIUS Let's get home. We have a lot to do. Lucinnius quickens his pace. LUCINNIUS Tonight... peace at last... Lucinnius is obviously in a state of shock. 
36   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                               36 Hector and Lucinnius are in his study. Lucinnius is busy clearing up his papers. He is less hysterical than in the previous scene, more aware of the reality of what he has to do. LUCINNIUS We'll do it with a knife, Hector. When everyone has gone to bed. The two of us, to the end... 
HECTOR I don't understand. What do you want me to do... I don't think I can help you... 
LUCINNIUS We'll help each other, Hector. We must. We've been through this whole mess together... we must die together. 
(CONTINUED) 
36   CONTINUED:                                                   36 HECTOR I don't know what you mean.   What mess?                                                * LUCINNIUS You don't understand do you? I'm asking you to die with me... you're my closest, my dearest slave... what would they say about me if you refused to die with me? This is honor... we're choosing                      * death... we're not going to submit to the humiliations that Cyprian can heap on us, are we? 
HECTOR You say we... I don't know... what is we? I've done nothing... I                        * know nothing... Lucinnius changes his tone, becomes more, in his own mind, frank, man-to-man. LUCINNIUS Hector... at Cyprian's this morning ... I had to sign certain papers ... tell a bit of a story... HECTOR What kind of story? LUCINNIUS A confession. That we were plotting against Cyprian and the provincial senate... we were short of names... most of the people I know were in the room... people I thought were my friends... so I mentioned you... I had to... Hector is stunned with shock... 
HECTOR So I'm a conspirator? 
LUCINNIUS Yes. So you see, I don't want you to die with me just because of my honor... it's more complicated... I'm sorry, Hector. I would be honored... if you would die with me... I mean it... Hector manages to speak.

36   CONTINUED:     (2)                                             36 HECTOR Can I sit down?

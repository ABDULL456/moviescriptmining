She points at Alejandro. 
He lets her vent. Burning the unused adrenaline. 
MATT Hey. I told you to stay here... 
MACY I'm not qualified for this. I'm good at what I do, but I'm not a soldier. 
MATT Don't sell yourself short. Reason Reggie's home is I know he's not ready for this, but he's gonna have to get ready real quick, because this is the future. Juarez is what happens when they dig in... 
MACY Don't put me in a situation where I have to break the law to stay alive. Don't do that to me. 
Steve walks up to Matt. 
STEVE You wanna get cracking? 
MATT On that note, I think you better stay out here. 
Matt winks and walks in the building, leaving Macy alone in the motor pool. 
INT INTERROGATION ROOM    DAY 
A door opens and we find GUILLERMO, 45, fat, three day stubble, and very unhappy to be here. His hands are cuffed behind his back. A DEA AGENT holds a bottle of water that Guillermo sucks like an infant. 
Matt walks in. 
MATT (CONT'D) Giving him a belly full of water... you devil. 
Matt smiles, the agent smiles back. 
Matt sits in the only other chair in the room. 
MATT (CONT'D) Didn't think we'd get you here, did you? 
GUILLERMO NO HABLO- 
MATT I love it when they don't hablo. Brought an old buddy of yours. Bet you `hablo' to him. 
The door opens and Alejandro walks in, carrying two five gallon jugs of water. It takes Guillermo a minute, then horror washes over his face. 
GUILLERMO El Medellin. 
MATT Alejandro, he remembers you. 
No expression on Alejandro's face. 
The DEA Agent moves to the door. 
DEA AGENT I'm gonna step out. 
He closes the door behind him. The red `record' button on the camera mounted in the corner goes out. We notice a DRAIN IN THE FLOOR. 
Alejandro walks toward Guillermo, stands across from him. Places a foot on his chest. Pushes... Hard... Guillermo sways back, like a chopped tree. He moves through frame in slow motion, falling out of frame. 
EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- DUSK. 
Macy leans against a car. Spots a guy with a cigarette. 
MACY Hey. Got another one of those? 
He gives her one. Lights it. She draws in, coughs. 
MACY (CONT'D) Been a while. Thanks. 
DELTA (O.S.) Like fireworks? 
She turns and sees a Delta operator. Holding a pair of BINOLULARS. 
DELTA (CONT'D) Come here. 
She follows him. They walk to the back of the motor pool to a stairway that leads to the roof of the building. He goes up. She hesitates. 
DELTA (CONT'D) Up to you. 
She takes the bait. Climbs up. 
They sit on the edge of the roof, facing Juarez. He begins glassing the area. 
MACY Fireworks is code for something, I assume.

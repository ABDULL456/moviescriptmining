Baby is leaning on her chin staring at Mary and Denise. The car radio plays in the background. 
MARY Can I help you with something? 
BABY I was just wondering. 
MARY Wondering what? 
BABY Are you two gals all funny with each other? 
MARY What? 
BABY You know... a couple of queers. 
MARY Do you believe this fucking girl? 
BABY (turning her attention to Mary) I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch. 
Denise tries to QUICKLY defuse the situation. 
DENISE No. No pussy licking here, but thanks for your concern. 
Bill and Jerry slide back into the car. 
BILL Well, I got some bad news and some bad news. 
MARY What? 
JERRY (fake Scottish accent) Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now. 
BILL And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage. 
DENISE For fucking sake Jerry, what the fuck are we gonna do? 
Baby starts laughing. 
MARY What the hell are you laughing about? 
BABY I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV. 
MARY Oh, wonderful. (muttering to herself) Fucking psycho. 
BILL I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road. 
BABY If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier. 
MARY Just back up. 
JERRY I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right? 
BABY Oh wait! I love this song! 
Baby reaches over and TURNS UP the VOLUME. She loudly sings along with the song. 
BILL Fine. I'll go straight. 
MARY What! 
BILL (over the loud music) Fine! I'll go straight! 
The car moves forward. After about fifty yards the car HITS something hard and gets stuck in a deep mud bog. 
BILL Fuck! We are fucked! 
DENISE Turn that fucking radio off! 
Bill shuts off the radio. 
DENISE Now what are we gonna do? 
BABY We can walk to my house from here. My brother's got a tow truck, he can come get your car. 
A silence falls over the car. 
MARY I think I'm going fucking crazy. 
DENISE I can't believe...

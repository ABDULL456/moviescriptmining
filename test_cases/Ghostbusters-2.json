{"train": "Ghostbusters II \nby Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd \nSeptember 29, 1988 Last revised Feburary 27, 1989 \nEXT.  MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY \nA high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village. \nEXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DAY \nA car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer. DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The \nbuilding superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to notice. \nDANA (exasperated) Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags? \nFRANK I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent. \nDANA You're also a human being, Frank. \nFRANK (reluctantly going to help) Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her. \nDANA (setting the wheel brakes on the buggy) Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually. \nShe continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy. \nFRANK (to the baby) Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger? \nFRANK (to Dana) That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett. \nDANA (finding her keys) Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week. \nFRANK Didn't I do it? \nBABY BUGGY \nIt starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand. \nEXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY \nHe GURGLES with delight at the movement. \nEXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY \nNeither of them notice the movement of the carriage. \nDANA No, you didn't, Frank. \nFRANK Okay, that's no problem. \nDANA That's exactly what you said last week. \nBUGGY WHEELS \nThe brakes unlock themselves. \nDANA \nShe reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward just out of her reach and stops.  Surprised by the movement, she reaches for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even further.  Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps rolling down the street at ever increasing speed. \nSIDEWALK \nDana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy swerves and continues unchecked. \nINTERSECTION \nCars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races toward the corner. \nDANA \nShe puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian. \nEXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY \nA city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy. \nBUGGY \nJANOSZ Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that. \nJanosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel. \nJANOSZ (to himself) I think she likes me. \nHe switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the phrases as he resumes working. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY \nDana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building.  A sign identifies it as \"The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research.\" \nINT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER) \nDana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean.  The device he is testing is a black box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic displays. \nDANA ... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped dead in the middle of the street \nSPENGLER \nDid anyone else see this happen? \nDANA Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this. \nSPENGLER I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation. \nAn ASSISTANT interrupts. \nASSISTANT We're ready, Dr. Spengler \nSPENGLER (to the Assistant) We'll start with the negative calibration. \nHe picks up the device and prepares to test it. \nDANA (curious) What are you working on, Egon? \nSPENGLER I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters. \nAn assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room.  Inside the waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated arguement. \nSPENGLER (to Dana) They think they're here for marriage counseling.  We've kept them waiting for two hours and we've been gradually increasing the temperature in the room. (checking a heat sensor) It's up to 95 degrees at the moment.  Now my assistant is going to enter and ask them if they'd mind waiting another half-hour. \nAs Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay.  They explode with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them through the glass.  After recording his readings, he returns to his Assistant. \nSPENGLER We'll do the happiness index next. (to Dana) I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you. \nDANA Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman. \nSPENGLER Oh no. \nDANA (affectedly casual) Do you ever see him? \nSPENGLER Occasionally \nDANA How is he these days? \nSPENGLER Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border. \nDANA Does he ever mention me? \nSPENGLER No.  Not that I can recall. \nThey move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys. \nDANA (slightly disappointed) Well, we didn't part on very good terms and we sort of lost track of each other when I got married. \nThe Assistant interrupts again. \nASSISTANT We're ready for the affection test. \nSPENGLER (to the assistant) Good.  Send in the puppy. \nDANA (continuing) I thought of calling him after my marriage ended, but --.  Anyway, I appreciate you're doing this, Egon \nThey watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl.  Spengler monitors her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog. \nDANA (handing him a card) This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me? \nVENKMAN Who?  Who?  Who? \nSTANTZ Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you! \nVENKMAN Who, Ray? \nSTANTZ (giving in) Dana!  Dana Barrett! \nVenkman lets go of his ears and smiles.  Spengler looks at Stantz and shakes his head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DANA'S APARTMENT - DAY (LATER) \nThe apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of modern and traditional pieces.  Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does day care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the DOORBELL RINGS. \nCUT TO: \nDana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door.  She opens it and admits Ray and Egon. \nDANA (hugging Ray) Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming. \nSTANTZ No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug. \nDANA (to Spengler) Hi, Egon. \nShe shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears in the doorway. \nVENKMAN Hi, Dana. \nDana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance. \nVENKMAN I knew you'd come crawling back to me. \nShe regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his presumptuousness. \nDANA Hello, Peter. \nVENKMAN (to Dana) You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show? \nDANA I have.  That's why I didn't call you first. \nVENKMAN I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys. \nStantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on the baby and the immediate physical environment. \nVENKMAN AND DANA \nVenkman starts nosing around the apartment.  Dana follows him. \nVENKMAN So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe. \nDANA He didn't \"ditch\" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it. \nVENKMAN He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know. \nDANA You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep. \nVENKMAN Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too. \nDANA Well, when you started introducing me as \"the old ball and chain,\" that's when I left. \nVENKMAN I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional. \nHe leaves her and crosses to Spengler. \nSPENGLER \nHe's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby with a tape measure and calipers. \nVENKMAN What are you going to do, Egon?  Knit him a snowsuit? \nSpengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar. \nSPENGLER I'd like to have a stool specimen \nVENKMAN Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons? \nVENKMAN (picking up the baby) Okay, kid.  Up you go. \nVENKMAN You mean like the time you got possessed and turned into a monster terror dog?  No, not a chance.  Total coincidence. (to Stantz and Spengler) Am I right? \nStantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the coincidence theory. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe museum has just closed for the day and the last of the visitors and employees are leaving. \nINT.  RESTORATION STUDIO - SAME TIME \nJanosz is working late on the painting of Vigo. \nVIGO PAINTING \nUnnoticed by Janosz, the eyes of Vigo start to glow. \nJANOSZ \nHe touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red, crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body, driving him to his knees. \nPAINTING \nThe figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures dramatically at him.  Then he speaks to Janosz in a commanding voice. \nVIGO I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you. \nJANOSZ (in agony) Command me, lord. \nVIGO On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again. \nBolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes. He screams and falls to his knees. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COFFEE SHOP - EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT \nVenkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee, sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street. \nVENKMAN I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one. \nSTANTZ Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting. \nVENKMAN Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile. \nEXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nSpengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the street.  Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is lit by strong work lights. \nPOLICE CAR \nIt turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift worksite and stops.  The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them. Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes. \nFIRST COP How ya doing? \nSPENGLER (reeking with guilt) Fine!  It's cutting fine now. \nFIRST COP (curious) Why are you cutting? \nSPENGLER (looking for one of the others) Why are we cutting?  Uh - boss! \nVenkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman. \nFIRST COP What are you doing here? \nVENKMAN (belligerent) What the hell's it look like we're doing? We're bustin out asses over here 'cause some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin' better to do than make idiots like us work late on a Friday night, right? (looks to Spengler for agreement) \nSPENGLER (with a \"right on\" fist) Yo. \nThe cops seem satisfied by the explanation. \nFIRST COP Okay, boys, take it easy. \nThey drive off.  Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts rubbing his sore shoulders. \nSPENGLER You were supposed to help me with this. \nVENKMAN You need the exercise. \nEXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nVenkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier.  A burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two cops. \nSUPERVISOR (no nonsense) Okay, what's the story here? \nVenkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex hardhat. \nVENKMAN What, I got time for this?  We got three thousand phones out in the Village and about eight million miles of cable to check. \nSUPERVISOR (not buying it) The phone lines are over there. (points to the curb) \nVenkman pops Spengler on the head. \nVENKMAN I told ya! \nStantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie. \nSTANTZ (O.S.) (filtered) Help!  Help!  Pull me up!  It's alive!  It's eating my boots. \nVenkman switches off the walkie-talkie. \nFIRST COP You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company. We checked.  Tell me another one. \nVenkman stares at the Cop for a long moment. \nVENKMAN Gas leak? \nINT.  VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME \nStantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which is now bubbling up the shaft after him. \nSTANTZ (shouting) Get me out of here!! \nDesperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old, rusting conduit. \nINT.  VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT \nThe conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS. \nEXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nVenkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz. \nEXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT \nOne by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness. \nSTANTZ (O.S.) Sorry. \nINT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nShe walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over the living room.  Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for information about the blackout.  She listens to a special news report for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby. She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door and looks in.  Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death. Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of the hallway.  He looks slightly dazed and even creepier. \nDANA (surprised) Janosz? \nJANOSZ Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right? \nHis affected concern is chilling.  She is frightened but conceals it from him. \nDANA (mechanically and cautiously) We're fine, Janosz. \nHe tires to look around her into the apartment. \nJANOSZ Do you need anything?  You want me to come in? \nDANA No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway. \nJANOSZ Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you. \nDANA Good night, Janosz. \nShe closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid. \nINT.  HALLWAY OF DANA'S BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nJanosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like headlights and he walks off down the hall. \nCUT TO: \nPROSECUTOR Do you know what this equipment is used for? \nCON ED (shrugs) I don't know.  Catching ghosts, I guess. \nPROSECUTOR (to the Judge) May I remind the court that the defendants are under a judicial restraining order that specifically forbids them from performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators. \nJUDGE So noted. \nPROSECUTOR Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the substance in the jar on the table marked Exhibit F? \nPROSECUTOR \nShe goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel. \nCON ED I been working underground for Con Ed for 27 years and I never saw anything like that in my life.  We checked out that tunnel the next day and we didn't find nothing.  If it was down there, they must have put it there. \nDEFENSE TABLE \nVenkman and Spengler look at Stantz. \nSTANTZ (defensively) Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there. \nSPENGLER It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source. \nLOUIS (nervously) Should I say that? \nSPENGLER I doubt that they'd believe us. \nLouis moans and goes back to his notes. \nWIPE TO: \nINT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER \nVenkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him. \nLOUIS So like you were just trying to help out your old friend because she was scared and you didn't really mean to do anything bad and you really love the city and won't ever do anything like this again, right? \nPROSECUTOR Objection, your Honor.  He's leading the witness. \nJUDGE The witness is leading him.  Sustained. \nLOUIS Okay, let me rephrase that question. (to venkman) Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children? \nVENKMAN Yes, I did.  We were city champs. \nPROSECUTOR Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial. \nJUDGE Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case? \nLOUIS (to Venkman) Do I? \nVENKMAN No, I think you've helped them enough already. \nLOUIS (to the Judge) No, I guess not. (to the Prosecutor) Your witness. \nThe Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish. \nPROSECUTOR So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street. \nVENKMAN Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice. \nThe gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order. \nJUDGE Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt. \nVENKMAN Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist. \nPROSECUTOR I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath. \nVENKMAN I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in. \nPROSECUTOR So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province? \nVENKMAN No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it. \nThe spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order. \nWIPE TO: \nHolding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the spectral intruders. \nJUDGE (terrified) You've got to do something! \nVENKMAN Who are they? \nJUDGE They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me. \nVENKMAN Maybe they just want to appeal. \nSCOLERI BROTHERS \nThey break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING. \nPROSECUTOR \nShe sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers. \nGHOSTBUSTERS \nThey jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge with them. \nVENKMAN These boys aren't playing around. \nJUDGE (desperately) You've got to stop them.  Please! \nLOUIS (thinking like a lawyer) Violating a judicial restraining order could expose my clients to serious criminal penalties.  As their attorney I'd have to advise them against it. \nSCOLERI BROTHERS \nThey start punching through the jury box. \nJUDGE \nHe is just about hysterical with fear. \nJUDGE All right!  All right!  I'm recinding the order.  Case dismissed!! (he pounds his gavel on the floor) Now do something! \nSTANTZ Let's go to work, boys. \nWith that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were being displayed as evidence.  They strap them on hastily as the Brothers continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge. \nVENKMAN (slinging the pack onto his back) Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are. \nSTANTZ (grabbing other gear) Okay, let's heat 'em up! \nThey flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle throwers. \nSTANTZ All right, throwers.  Set for full neutronas on stream. \nThey switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms. \nSCOLERI BROTHERS \nThey are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts them. \nVENKMAN Hey!  Why don't you pick on someone your own size? \nThe towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot lightning at their new adversaries. \nSTANTZ (to the others) On my signal, boys.  Open 'em up -- Now! \nThey all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom. \nVENKMAN Spengs, take the door.  Ray, let's try and work them down and into the corner. \nWorking as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on the floor. \nSTANTZ Watch it!  I'm coming under you, Pete. \nThey circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers.  Finally, Ray sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of light energy. \nSTANTZ Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now -- Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him down -- trapping -- trapping -- now! \nHe stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the traps which snap shut. \nINT.  COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY \nLEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a ghost inside each trap. \nSTANTZ (TO CAMERA) So don't wait another minute.  Make your supernatural problem our supernatural problem. Call now, because we're still -- \nALL (in unison, mechanically) -- Ready to believe you. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  JACK HARDEMEYER'S OFFICE - DAY \nHardemeyer is watching the Ghostbusters commercial on a TV in his office. He bangs his fist on his desk and angrily switches OFF the TV. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY (LATER) \nThe garage door opens and the new improved ECTOMOBILE comes ROARING out onto the street, its ghostly SIREN MOANING and WAILING.  Louis comes running out after it. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY \nLouis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor. He sniffs around, following the smell. \nLOUIS Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really big -- \nHe freezes. \nINT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV \nSlimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing down Louis's bag lunch.  Slimer looks up and sees Louis. \nSLIMER AND LOUIS \nThey both scream and run off in opposite directions. \nSLIMER \nHe passes right through a wall and disappears. \nLOUIS \nHe runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry. \nLOUIS (screaming) Help!  There's a thing! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER) \nRunners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog along the track that circles the reservoir.  One of the runners looks behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams. \nGHOSTLY JOGGER \nA ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.  Other runners stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.  Seemingly oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse. \nEXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME) \nVenkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup. \nSTANTZ \nHe's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging track. \nGHOST JOGGER \nHe approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting.  As the ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit concealed control buttons.  A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride. Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger. \nVENKMAN (checking his watch) You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes? \nSTANTZ If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  JEWELRY STORE - DAY \nThe Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap dime-store Santa Claus hats. \nSTANTZ (to the client) Merry Christmas! \nCUT TO: \nVENKMAN I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item. \nWINSTON Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand. \nVENKMAN So we'll put a warning on the label. \nStantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving.  Venkman looks at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot. \nVENKMAN (to the toaster) Go ahead.  I dare you. \nSuddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand and won't let go.  The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and easily withdraws his hand. \nVENKMAN Just kidding. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nDana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet.  She's wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby.  She turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby. \nDANA (talking sweetly to the baby) Look at you.  I think we got more food on your shirt than we got in your mouth. \nBATHTUB \nThe water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the bottom of the tub.  Dana reaches over and turns off the water without looking into the tub.  When she turns away, both taps start to spin by themselves and the tub flexes and bulges. \nDANA \nStill unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath into the tub. \nBATHTUB \nThe rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the bubble bath. \nDANA She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub. She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to close up around the baby like a hugh mouth.  Dana screams, snatches the baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER) \nThe big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment.  Venkman is asleep on the floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed just short of the bedroom.  The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to his feet and answers it.  He opens the door and sees Dana standing there. She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked, wrapped in a baby blanket. \nDANA (somewhat embarrassed to be there) I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out? \nVENKMAN (surprised to see her) No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in. (noting her apparel) Are we having a pajama party? \nDANA (upset) Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar. \nVenkman looks at her for a long moment. \nVENKMAN You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised. \nDANA I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me. \nVENKMAN Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown? \nDANA (distraught) I don't know what to do anymore. \nVENKMAN I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here. \nHe exits to the bathroom.  She looks around the loft, amazed at the disorder.  Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and takes Oscar from her. \nVENKMAN Now this kid has a serious nudity problem. \nHe spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts tying it around him like a diaper. \nVENKMAN (to the baby) This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it. \nDANA Peter, what about the bathtub? \nVENKMAN (grabs the phone and dials) We'll take care of that. (on the phone) Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid. \nDANA It was full of this awful pink ooze. \nVENKMAN (to Ray) Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know. \nHe hangs up. \nVENKMAN They're going over there right now.  You might as well make yourself at home.  Let me show you around. (he crosses to the kitchen area) This is the cuisine de maison -- \nINT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) \nJanosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter.  He rushes over and stops them at the door. \nJANOSZ Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here. \nVENKMAN I know. \nJANOSZ Then why have you come? \nVENKMAN We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first. \nSTANTZ (to Spengler and Winston) Let's sweep it, boys. \nThey deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices. \nVENKMAN (to Janosz) You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny? \nJANOSZ (nervous) The Upper West Side. \nSPENGLER (consulting his PKE meter) This entire room is extremely hot, Peter. \nJANOSZ What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman? \nVENKMAN We'll know when we find it.  You just sit tight.  This won't take long. \nSTANTZ \nUsing the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.  Venkman comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels. \nVENKMAN This is the one that looked at Dana. \nJANOSZ It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things -- \nVENKMAN (interrupts) I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her. (to Vigo) Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you. \nThey watch the painting for any sign of movement. \nVIGO \nHis eyes stare lifelessly into the distance. \nSTANTZ AND VENKMAN \nVenkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo. \nVENKMAN (to Vigo) Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it. (to Stantz) Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here. \nSTANTZ I'll get one more reading. \nVenkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting.  Stantz scans the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's. \nVIGO \nHis eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul. \nSTANTZ \nHe stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle transformation occurs within him.  Winston comes up behind him and breaks the spell. \nWINSTON (looking at the painting) Now that's one ugly dude. \nSTANTZ (coming back to his senses) Huh?  What? \nWINSTON You finished here? \nSTANTZ (distracted) What?  Yeah. \nWINSTON Are you all right?  You coming down with something? \nSTANTZ No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go. \nThey head for the door. \nJANOSZ \nHe escorts the Ghostbusters to the door. \nJANOSZ So you see, everything is in order, is it not? \nVENKMAN (confidentially, to Spengler) Watch him, Egon.  Don't even let him shave. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER) \nThere's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small suitcase of Dana's. \nVENKMAN (calls out) I'm home! \nHe looks around the large open loft. \nVENKMAN (to himself) I knew it.  She cleaned. \nHe hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom.  The door is half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through the transparent vinyl curtain.  He closes the bathroom door and looks at the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling off.  Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel.  She jumps back into the bathroom. \nShe comes out again, this time wearing a robe. \nVENKMAN Are you all squeaky clean now? \nDANA (humoring him) Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment? \nShe squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door. \nVENKMAN (through the door) Nothing.  They stayed there all night, went through your personal stuff, made a bunch of long-distance phone calls and cleaned out your refrigerator.  And didn't find anything. \nDana opens the bedroom door. \nDANA They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now? \nVENKMAN Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it. \nDANA I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know. \nVENKMAN It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees. \nDANA Does she know anything about babies? \nVENKMAN Janine Melnitz, are you kidding? (handing her the flowers) Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities. \nDANA Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner. \nShe smiles and closes the door again.  He opens the closet and starts looking for his good suit. \nVENKMAN Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here? \nDANA (O.S.) I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty. \nVENKMAN (shaking his head) I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty. \nHe pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them. \nVENKMAN These aren't so bad yet.  You just hang them up for a while and they're fine. \nCUT TO: INT.  FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING \nJanine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights. Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs.  She starts primping and freshening up her makeup. \nINT.  FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME \nLouis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once and for all.  He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband. \nLOUIS (to himself) Okay, Stinky, this is it.  Showdown time. You and me, pal.  You think you're smarter than I am?  We'll see about that. (loud) Oh, hello, Pizza Man!  Oh, two larges!  I only ordered one.  Oh, pepperoni and pineapple.  My absolute favorite.  I guess I'll have to eat these both by myself. \nTHE CEILING \nSlimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging upside down. \nLOUIS \nHe spots Slimer through the rearview mirror. \nLOUIS (quietly) Okay, let's boogie! \nHe whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a gash across the ceiling. \nTHE STAIRS \nJanine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and strikes the wall behind her.  Slimer disappears. \nSTANTZ That's it.  It's on the bottom. \nSPENGLER Nine feet -- ten -- \nWINSTON Is the line sinking? \nSPENGLER No, the slime is rising. \nStantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the platform and around his boots. \nSTANTZ (alarmed) Let's get out of here, boys. \nHe starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck. \nSpengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger than all three of them.  As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt.  Spengler lets go in time but Winston doesn't.  He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow. Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in after him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER) \nDana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne. \nVENKMAN (very intimate) Here's to -- us. \nShe sighs and drinks. \nVENKMAN So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions? \nDANA I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me. \nVENKMAN Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe? \nDANA For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real? \nVENKMAN All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me? \nDANA Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know. \nVENKMAN I'm not even good for me. \nDANA Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know. \nVENKMAN Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century. \nDANA (already feeling the effects of the champagne) So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000? \nVENKMAN Let me jingle you right now. \nHe leans over to kiss her. \nDANA Maybe I should call Janine. \nVENKMAN Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children. \nThey kiss. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nJanine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby. \nJANINE (looking around) I can't believe a person could actually live like this. \nLOUIS (to the baby) So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them. \nJANINE It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch. \nLOUIS (continuing) So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired. \nLouis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down. \nJANINE You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell. (as he returns) Why don't you come here and sit with me? \nLOUIS Okay. \nHe sits stiffly beside her on the sofa. \nJANINE (getting close) Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you? \nStantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look. \nSTANTZ (self-conscious) Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but forget that.  We have to see the mayor as soon as possible. \nCOP Look, Doc, why don't you just go home. You'll get a good night's sleep and then you can give the mayor a call in the morning. Come on. \nHe takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists. \nSTANTZ We're not going anywhere with you.  I told you we have to see the mayor now. \nCOP (grabbing Stantz) I'm warning you.  You can come along peaceably or -- \nVENKMAN (grabs the Cop) Hey, don't be an idiot.  This is serious. \nCOP (angry) Look, pal, keep this up and you're going with them. \nVENKMAN Oh, yeah? \nCOP (has had enough) Yeah, let's go.  You're all under arrest. \nThe Cop catches Venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the restaurant. \nVENKMAN (to Dana) Finish your dessert -- it's already paid for.  I'll call you. \nThey all exit, causing a major commotion among the other diners. \nEXT.  ARMAND'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nThe police car is parked right behind Ecto-2.  Spengler stops at the police car and confronts the cops. \nSPENGLER Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy. This is a matter of vital importance. \nVenkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags. \nCOP What are you doing? \nVENKMAN I just want to get your names right for when the mayor asks us why we didn't let him know about this sooner. \nThe Cops look at each other, uncertain about what to do. \nCOP (relenting) Okay, Doc.  You want to see the mayor, you got it.  Follow us. \nThey head for their respective vehicles. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nLouis and Janine are on the sofa making out when Dana enters.  They jump up and start smoothing their clothes. \nLOUIS (embarrassed) Oh, hello, Dana.  we were just -- we were -- \nDANA I know what you were doing, Louis.  It's all right. \nJANINE How was your date? \nDANA Typical.  Peter was arrested.  Has he called? \nLOUIS No, nobody called. \nDana frowns. \nDANA Is everything all right with Oscar? \nJANINE Oh, he's fine.  He's such a good baby.  He was a little fussy at first, but we gave him a Freach bread pizza and he went right to sleep. \nDANA (relieved) Oh, good.  I'll just check on him. \nShe crosses to the bedroom. \nINT.  VENKMAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nDana looks at Oscar sleeping peacefully on the bed.  She starts to change clothes. \nINT.  VENKMAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nLouis and Janine aren't sure what to do. \nLOUIS Should we go? \nHardemeyer shakes his hand and exits as the door slams shut on the Ghostbusters. \nINT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nLouis and Janine are watching an old rerun on TV, eating popcorn, while Dana is stretched out on the other sofa. \nDANA (wishing they'd leave) You know you really don't have to stay. Peter should be back soon. \nLOUIS Oh no, we don't mind. \nShe hears a little CRY from the nursery and sits up. \nDANA Excuse me.  I think Oscar is up. \nShe crosses to the bedroom. \nINT.  VENKMAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nDana enters and immediately notices that the crib is empty and the window is open. \nDANA (screams) Louis! \nFrantic now, Dana rushes to the window and looks out, as Louis and Janine come running in. \nEXT.  WINDOW LEDGE - DANA'S POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) \nThe baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building, fifty feet above the street, staring off into the distance as if he's waiting for something. \nEXT.  WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nDana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby. Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes. \nLOUIS AND JANINE \nThey lean out the window, gaping at the apparition. \nEXT.  VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION \nA sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.  Her face looks remarkably like Janosz Poha's.  The nanny extends her hand to the BABY who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it. \nDANA \nShe watches in helpless horror. \nDANA (screams) No!! \nGHOST NANNY \nShe picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and smiles at Dana.  The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby. \nDANA \nShe watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through the window assisted by Louis and Janine. \nDANA (resolutely) Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him what happened. \nLOUIS (confused and worried) Where're you going? \nDANA To get my baby back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER) \nA taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum.  The moment the door closes behind her, there is a loud THUNDERCLAP, the ground trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the building. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC - PADDED ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nVenkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are in a padded cell.  They are handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their waists.  Venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical Psychiatrist. \nSTANTZ We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian is alive in a painting at the Manhattan Museum. \nPSYCHIATRIST I see. And are there any other paintings in the museum with bad spirits in them? \nSPENGLER (impatient) You're wasting valuable time!  We have reason to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been collecting under the city. \nPSYCHIATRIST Yes, tell me about the slime. \nLOUIS Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you. \nSHERMAN Like what? \nLOUIS I got you out of those bad tax shelters. \nSHERMAN You were the one who got me in. \nLOUIS I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she? \nSHERMAN Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble. \nLOUIS I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm. \nSHERMAN Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff. \nSherman looks out the window. \nEXT.  SKY - SHERMAN'S POV \nThe sky begins to go dark as the sun is magically eclipsed. \nINT.  EXAMINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY \nThe room goes dark.  Louis switches on a lamp which casts an eerie light on his face. \nLOUIS (spooky) Do you believe it now, Sherm? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) \nA drainpipe starts dripping slime into the river near the Cunard Line docks. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  PUBLIC FOUNTAIN (59TH AND FIFTH) - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) \nWith the Plaza Hotel in the background, the fountain starts to spout psycho-reactive slime. \nHOTEL ENTRANCE \nA well-heeled MAN and WOMAN step out of a limousine and walk up the steps toward the revolving door.  She looks up at the sky and frowns. \nWOMAN (shrewish) I told you we should have stayed in Palm Beach.  The weather here gets stranger every year. \nMAN Yes, dear. \nShe doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat.  The doorman nods courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs. \nWOMAN \nShe yelps in pain. \nWOMAN (to the doorman) Something just bit me! \nThe doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat comes alive.  MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air.  Reacting quickly, the doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror. The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MIDTOWN CENTRAL POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) \nThe squad room is busy as DETECTIVES try to answer the flood of calls regarding the wave of supernatural events sweeping the city. \nDETECTIVE ONE (on the phone) Look, lady, of course there are dead people there.  It's a cemetery ... (his face falls) They were asking you for directions? \nDETECTIVE TWO (on another phone) Was this a big dinosaur or a little dinosaur? ... Oh, just the skeleton, huh?  Well, where is it now? \nDETECTIVE THREE (on the phone) Wait a second -- the park bench was chasing you?  You mean, someone was chasing you in the park ... No, the bench itself was chasing you.  I see -- \nA weary SERGEANT answers a RINGING PHONE. \nSERGEANT Manhattan Central, Flaherty speaking ... Yeah ... yeah? ... What?  Who is this? ... Wait a second. \nHe puts the caller on \"Hold\" and turns the LIEUTENANT. \nSERGEANT Lieutenant, I think you better talk to this guy. \nLIEUTENANT (on another call) What is it?  I'm talkin' here! \nThe workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers. \nSPENGLER (monitoring valences) Full neutronas, maser assist. \nThey adjust their settings and prepare to fire. \nSTANTZ Throw 'em! \nThey trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime. \nVENKMAN (to the firemen) Okay, who knows \"Cumbaya?\" \nA few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands.  Venkman grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum. \nVENKMAN All right.  Nice and sweet -- (starts singing) Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya -- \nStantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding hands and swaying to the music. \nALL (singing) Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya. \nStantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime. \nSTANTZ Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff. \nVENKMAN Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray? \nSPENGLER It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell. \nSTANTZ I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it. \nSPENGLER We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol -- \nHis eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a line drawing of the Statue of Liberty. \nSTANTZ (he sees it, too) Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us -- \nSPENGLER Something good -- \nVENKMAN And pure -- \nWINSTON And decent. \nEXT.  THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nThere is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives with a police escort.  Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor himself and they cross to the museum entrance. \nHardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the Ghostbusters. \nHARDEMEYER Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control. \nVENKMAN Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one. \nMAYOR Are you telling me there're people trapped in there? \nHARDEMEYER (to his assistant) This is dynamite.  Call A.P., U.P.I., and C.N.N. and get them down here right away. When the police bring this kid out I want them to hand it right to the mayor and I want it all on camera. \nSTANTZ Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by midnight, you're going to go down in history as the man who let New York get sucked down into the tenth level of hell. \nThe Mayor stops to consider the situation. \nMAYOR (to the Fire Captain) Can you get into that museum? \nFIRE CAPTAIN If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe. \nThe Mayor turns to Venkman. \nMAYOR You know why all these things are happening? \nVENKMAN We tried to tell you last night, but Mr. Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony bin. \nHardemeyer flips out. \nHARDEMEYER This is preposterous!  You can't seriously believe all this mumbo-jumbo!  It's the Twentieth Century, for crying out loud! (viciously, to Venkman) Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff is or how you got it all over the museum, but you better get it off and I mean right now! \nHe pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily through the slime curtain.  Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the slime. \nMAYOR (to Venkman) Okay, just tell me what you need. \nCUT TO: \nVIGO \nHe is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the knees down.  He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash his magic powers. \nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS \nThey stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been neutralized by the good will of the people. \nSTANTZ Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey. \nVENKMAN The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know. \nWINSTON (arming his slime-blower) Say goodnight now. \nSuddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield. \nSPENGLER Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray! \nSTANTZ (strangling) Do it!  Just do it! \nWinston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray. \nVIGO \nHe bellows and drops Ray, then falls back into the painting. \nINT.  MUSEUM - PAINTING - NIGHT \nThe paint turns liquid, melts off the canvas and runs onto the floor revealing another painting underneath it. \nINT.  MUSEUM - GHOSTBUSTERS - NIGHT (AFTER BATTLE) \nVenkman, Spengler and Winston rush over to Ray and kneel beside him.  He is completely covered with slime and motionless. \nSPENGLER (examining him) He's breathing. \nWinston wipes the slime off Ray's face and Ray opens his eyes. \nWINSTON Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man? \nSTANTZ (smiles lovingly) Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life. \nVENKMAN Oh, no.  We've got to live with this? \nThey pull him to his feet. \nSTANTZ I love you guys.  You're the best friends I've ever had. \nHe hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well.  Venkman recoils in disgust. \nVENKMAN Hey, I just had this suit cleaned. (indicating Janosz) Take care of the wiggler, will you. \nVenkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.  She hugs Venkman. \nVENKMAN What is this -- a love in? (notes the symbols painted on the baby's body) Hey, sailor.  I think the tattoos are a little much, don't you? \nHe picks up the baby. \nDANA (to Venkman) I think he likes you.  I think I do too. \nVENKMAN Finally came to your senses, huh? \nThey hug and kiss. \nSPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ \nThey help Janosz to his feet.  He's dazed but unhurt. \nJANOSZ (restored to normalcy) What happened? \nSTANTZ (calmly) Sir, you had a violent, prolonged, transformative psychic episode.  But it's over now.  Want a coffee? \nJANOSZ (extremely nice) That's very kind of you. \nSPENGLER (to Stantz) He's fine, Ray.  Physically intact, psychomagnetherically neutral. \nJANOSZ Is that good? \nWINSTON It's where you want to be. \n", "test1_input": "Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing \nSTANTZ AND WINSTON 'There's something wrong in the neighborhood. Who you gonna call?' \nKIDS (all together) He-Man!! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER) \nStantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile. \nWINSTON That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds. \nSTANTZ Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season. \nThey get in the car \nINT.  ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nStantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over. \nWINSTON Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are. \nSTANTZ (tries to start the car again) Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city. \nWINSTON Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise. \nSTANTZ Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow. \nHe turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits of metal onto the pavement.  Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies.  Frustrated, Stantz bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel \nCUT TO: \nINT.  WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER) \nA bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR, Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and we return to the show in progress: \"World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter Venkman.\"  There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat infamous ex-Ghostbuster. \nVENKMAN \nHe turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone, understated and intimate. \nVENKMAN Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund. (to his guest) Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it? \nMILTON Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger. \nVENKMAN Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book? \nMILTON I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. \nVENKMAN This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe. \nMILTON (irritated) This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve. \nVENKMAN (placating) Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind? \nThe CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman. \nELAINE According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016. \nVENKMAN Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine? \nELAINE I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world. \nVENKMAN Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn? \nELAINE It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter. \nVENKMAN (humoring her) No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time. (does his wrap-up right TO the CAMERA) Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets. (holds up a hairless cat) Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ... (puts a finger to his temple and sends out a though to his viewers) ... Good night. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER) \nVenkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a well-meaning young incompetent. \nVENKMAN Where do you find these people?  I thought we were having the telekinetic guy who bends the spoons? \nNORMAN A lot of the better psychics won't come on the show.  They think you're too skeptical. \n", "test1_true": "There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants. \nVENKMAN (to Norman) What's all this? \nNORMAN They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.' \nVENKMAN The Mayor!  He's a friend of mine. \nVenkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio. \nVENKMAN (calling to the Mayor) Lenny! \nThe Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know him. \nVENKMAN (starts to follow him) Lenny!  It's Pete Venkman! \nThe plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand against Venkman's chest. \nHARDEMEYER (snide) Can I help you? \nVENKMAN (dangerous) Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest. \nHardemeyer smiles and drops his hand. \nHARDEMEYER I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you? \nVENKMAN I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him. \nHARDEMEYER (scornful) I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately? \nVENKMAN No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you. \nHARDEMEYER (bristling) Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me? \nHardemeyer walks off with the two cops. \nVENKMAN Okay, I get it.  But I want you to tell Lenny that, because of you, I'm not voting for him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY \nThe broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and visitors.  Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and enters the museum. \nINT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER) \nWe are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an incredibly powerful evil presence.  Then we PULL BACK to reveal the studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit by large skylights in the ceiling.  Working on the Vigo painting is JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy.  Janosz is staring longingly across the room at Dana. \nDANA \nShe is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy.  Janosz watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her shoulder. \nJANOSZ (with an East European accent) Still working on the Turner? \nDana jumps, startled by the intrusion. \nDANA Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz. \nJANOSZ You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations. \nDANA Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra. \nVIGO PAINTING \nAt the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his head and looks at Dana. \nJANOSZ AND DANA \nNeither of them notice the movement in the painting. \nJANOSZ (disappointed) We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today? \nDANA Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment. (looks at her watch) In fact, I'd better go. \nShe starts gathering up her things. \nJANOSZ Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something? \nDANA (trying to brush him off) I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time. \n", "test1_id": 972, "test2_input": "VENKMAN \nUnaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life, holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do. \nVENKMAN You know you can go to Art World and get these huge sofa-size paintings for about forty-five bucks. \nHe starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio. \nDANA I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art. \nVENKMAN As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case. \nThey are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz. \nJANOSZ (smiling at Venkman) Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? \nDANA Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha. \nVenkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up. \nJANOSZ (avoiding his gaze) Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television. \nVENKMAN How are you? (looking over at the Vigo painting) What's that you're working on, Johnny? \nJanosz winces at the nickname but lets it go.  Venkman and Dana cross to the Vigo painting.  Janosz steps protectively in front of it. \nJANOSZ It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century. \nVENKMAN (staring at the painting) Too bad for the Moldavians. \nJANOSZ (defensive) \nHe was a very powerful magician.  A genius in many ways and quite a skilled painter. \nDANA He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage. \nVENKMAN Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs? (picking up a brush) A fluffy little white kitten in the corner. \nVenkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand. \nJANOSZ (with forced good will) We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman. \nVENKMAN Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you. \nDana looks disapprovingly at Venkman. \nVENKMAN (to Janosz) I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you. \nJANOSZ My pleasure. \nVenkman and Dana cross back to her workspace. \nVENKMAN (confidentially) I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy. \nDANA Good-bye, Peter. \nVENKMAN (dragging his feet) I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you. (calls out to Janosz) Later, Johnny! \nHe exits. \nVIGO \nVigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench. \nDANA \nShe stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily leaves the studio. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY \nVenkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab area. \nSTANTZ Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you. \nVENKMAN (to Spengler) It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it? \nStantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a Tupperware container. \n", "test2_true": "He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute. \nVENKMAN And now you're going to eat it? \nSTANTZ No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state. \nHe takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a large Petri dish. \nSTANTZ Now watch this. \nHe leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it. \nSTANTZ (simulating anger) You worthless piece of slime!! (as the slime starts to twitch and glow) You ignorant disgusting blob!! \nSPECIMEN \nIt bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult. \nSTANTZ You foul, obnoxious muck!! \nSTANTZ \nHe continues venting his rage on the slime. \nSTANTZ I've seen some real crud in my time, but you're a chemical disgrace!! \nThe specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the Petri dish. \nSTANTZ AND SPENGLER \nThey turn to Venkman for his reaction.  He's dumbfounded. \nVENKMAN This is what you do with your spare time? \nSTANTZ (very excited) This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states. \nVENKMAN 'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it. \nSPENGLER We've found it at every event site we've been to lately. \nWINSTON (poking at the slime) You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'? \nSTANTZ Like a goat on garbage. \nSTANTZ We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction. \nVENKMAN What kind of tests? \nSTANTZ (a little embarrassed) Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things -- \nVENKMAN You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you? \nSpengler reacts as if he might be. \nSTANTZ It really responds to music. (to Spengler) Let's calm it down. \nSpengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing \"Cumbaya\" to the slime specimen. \nSPECIMEN \nIt stops bubbling and starts to shrink. \nWINSTON Does it have any favorites? \nSTANTZ It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson. \nVenkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster. \nSTANTZ Watch this. \nStantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's \"HIGHER AND HIGHER\" BLASTS from the speakers. \nTOASTER \nIt shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC. \nVENKMAN \nHe stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat. \n", "test2_id": 973, "test3_input": "VENKMAN (into a microphone) Okay, Libby.  Let's get it in gear. \nThey feel a strong vibration and the statue starts to move. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - NIGHT \nNew Years Eve celebrants line the riverfront, pointing and gawking at an incredible sight. \nEXT.  EAST RIVER - THEIR POV - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nThe statue is moving up the river almost completely submerged, only her head from the nose up is visible above the surface. \nINT.  OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nWinston looks out apprehensively. \nWINSTON How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim. \nVENKMAN It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card. \nSPENGLER With a water temperature of forty degrees we'd survive approximately fifteen minutes. \nStantz studies a maritime navigational chart. \nSTANTZ I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th. \nVENKMAN Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  RIVERFRONT - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nSpectators cheer wildly, inspired by the sight of the Statue. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MUSEUM RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nJanosz is sitting next to Dana, still wheedling her with promises and self-serving logic. \nJANOSZ Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship. \nDANA We don't have a relationship. \nJANOSZ I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking. \nDANA I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child. \nJANOSZ Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it. \nDANA I'd rather not. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nPeople are jammed together shoulder to shoulder filling Times Square, watching the big Seiko clock count down the last ten minutes to midnight. Suddenly, they look down Broadway and see a magnificent sight. \nEXT.  BROADWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nThe Statue of Liberty is walking up Broadway approaching 42nd Street, with \"Higher and Higher\" BOOMING from the SPEAKERS inside.  A great cheer goes up, and the crowd goes wild with joy, dancing and singing along with the MUSIC. \nINT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) \nSpengler reads the Giga-meter. \nSPENGLER It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing. \nVENKMAN (patting the Statue) They love you, Lib.  Keep it up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT (LATER) \nThe avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed, blocking all the side streets.  A squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around the corner at 72nd Street and proceeds up Fifth Avenue in the direction of the museum.  Then MUSIC is heard BOOMING in the distance, the ground shakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto Fifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "The Ghostbusters can see the museum ahead. \nVENKMAN So far so good. \nSPENGLER (worried) I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet. \nSTANTZ I don't think they make Nikes in her size. \nVENKMAN We're almost there, Lib. (to Stantz) Step on it. \nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nThe Statue's huge foot comes down and squashes a car. \nINT.  OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nThe Ghostbusters look down at the flattened car. \nSTANTZ (shouts out the window) My Fault! \nVENKMAN (shouts) She's new in town. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

MUSEUM - PAINTING - NIGHT \nA strange light spreads over the painting.  As the light moves onto his face, Vigo spreads his arms wide and his upper body starts to emerge from the canvas. \nVIGO Soon my life begins.  Then woe to the weak, all power to me, the world is mine. \nINT.  MUSEUM - JANOSZ - NIGHT \nThe baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it.  Then suddenly a dark shadow falls across the skylight.  Janosz looks up. \nINT.  MUSEUM - JANOSZ'S POV - SKYLIGHT - NIGHT \nThe Statue of Liberty is looming over the skylight looking down on Janosz with an expression of righteous anger on it's face. \nEXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nKneeling beside the museum, the statue draws back it's mighty right arm and smashes the skylight with its torch. \nINT.  RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nJanosz retreats from the shower of broken glass as the Ghostbusters come sliding down ropes into the studio and confront Janosz with their new weapons.  Quick as a flash, Dana seizes the moment, dashes across the studio and snatches the baby from Vigo's outstretched arms. \nVENKMAN (to Janosz) Happy New Year. \nINT.  MUSEUM - VIGO PAINTING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nVigo bellows in rage. \nINT.  MUSEUM - STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nJanosz steps in front of the painting. \nSPENGLER Hi there.  Feel free to try something stupid. \nJanosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo. \nJANOSZ You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him. \nVENKMAN (sighs) Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse. \nWith that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from head to toe, blowing him into the corner.  Then they turn to Vigo. \n", "test3_id": 974}

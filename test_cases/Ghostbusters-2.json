UNIVERSITY - DAY \nDana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building.  A sign identifies it as \"The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research.\" \nINT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER) \nDana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean.  The device he is testing is a black box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic displays. \nDANA ... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped dead in the middle of the street \nSPENGLER \nDid anyone else see this happen? \nDANA Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this. \nSPENGLER I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation. \nAn ASSISTANT interrupts. \nASSISTANT We're ready, Dr. Spengler \nSPENGLER (to the Assistant) We'll start with the negative calibration. \nHe picks up the device and prepares to test it. \nDANA (curious) What are you working on, Egon? \nSPENGLER I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters. \nAn assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room.  Inside the waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated arguement. \nSPENGLER (to Dana) They think they're here for marriage counseling.  We've kept them waiting for two hours and we've been gradually increasing the temperature in the room. (checking a heat sensor) It's up to 95 degrees at the moment.  Now my assistant is going to enter and ask them if they'd mind waiting another half-hour. \nAs Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay.  They explode with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them through the glass.  After recording his readings, he returns to his Assistant. \nSPENGLER We'll do the happiness index next. (to Dana) I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you. \nDANA Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman. \nSPENGLER Oh no. \nDANA (affectedly casual) Do you ever see him? \nSPENGLER Occasionally \nDANA How is he these days? \nSPENGLER Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border. \nDANA Does he ever mention me? \nSPENGLER No.  Not that I can recall. \nThey move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys. \nDANA (slightly disappointed) Well, we didn't part on very good terms and we sort of lost track of each other when I got married. \nThe Assistant interrupts again. \nASSISTANT We're ready for the affection test. \nSPENGLER (to the assistant) Good.  Send in the puppy. \nDANA (continuing) I thought of calling him after my marriage ended, but --.  Anyway, I appreciate you're doing this, Egon \nThey watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl.  Spengler monitors her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog. \nDANA (handing him a card) This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me? \n", "test1_true": "DANA Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind. \nSPENGLER I won't. \nDANA Thank you. \nShe shakes his hand and exits. \nSPENGLER (to his assistant) Now let's see how she reacts when we take away the puppy \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER) \nIt's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in Greenwich Village.  The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old books full of arcane metaphysical lore.  The TELEPHONE RINGS. \nSTANTZ (v.o., answering the phone) Ray's Occult. \nINT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS \nThe shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal. Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan sweater over a T-shirt.  He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews on a battered, reeking pipe.  As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text. \nSTANTZ (on the phone) Yeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What have I got?  I've got alchemy, astrology, apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon intercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've got it all -- what are you looking for? ... Don't have any.  Try the stockyards. \nHe hangs up. \nSPENGLER Who was that? \nSTANTZ Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything? \nSPENGLER (referring to the book) This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses. \nSTANTZ You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis. \nSPENGLER (going to the stacks) Good idea. \nThe bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop. \nVENKMAN Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request. \nSTANTZ Oh, hiya, Pete. \nVENKMAN So, no goat hooves, huh? \nSTANTZ (strung) I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going? \nVENKMAN Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub? \nSTANTZ (slightly evasive) Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something. \nSpengler steps out of the stacks. \nVENKMAN Egon! \nSPENGLER Hello, Venkman. \nVENKMAN How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh? \nSPENGLER I think they're more interested in my epididymis. \nVENKMAN I don't even want to know where that is. \nVenkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge. \nSTANTZ Oh, your book came in, Venkman.  Magical Paths to Fortune and Power. \nHe hands Venkman the book. \nVENKMAN Great. (reading the contents) So what are you guys working on? \nSTANTZ Oh, just checking something for an old friend. \nVENKMAN Who? \nSTANTZ (at a loss) Who?  Just -- someone we know. \nVENKMAN Oh, Ray -- \nHe grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up. \n", "test1_id": 972, "test2_input": "VENKMAN Who?  Who?  Who? \nSTANTZ Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you! \nVENKMAN Who, Ray? \nSTANTZ (giving in) Dana!  Dana Barrett! \nVenkman lets go of his ears and smiles.  Spengler looks at Stantz and shakes his head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DANA'S APARTMENT - DAY (LATER) \nThe apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of modern and traditional pieces.  Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does day care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the DOORBELL RINGS. \nCUT TO: \nDana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door.  She opens it and admits Ray and Egon. \nDANA (hugging Ray) Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming. \nSTANTZ No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug. \nDANA (to Spengler) Hi, Egon. \nShe shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears in the doorway. \nVENKMAN Hi, Dana. \nDana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance. \nVENKMAN I knew you'd come crawling back to me. \nShe regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his presumptuousness. \nDANA Hello, Peter. \nVENKMAN (to Dana) You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show? \nDANA I have.  That's why I didn't call you first. \nVENKMAN I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys. \nStantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on the baby and the immediate physical environment. \nVENKMAN AND DANA \nVenkman starts nosing around the apartment.  Dana follows him. \nVENKMAN So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe. \nDANA He didn't \"ditch\" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it. \nVENKMAN He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know. \nDANA You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep. \nVENKMAN Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too. \nDANA Well, when you started introducing me as \"the old ball and chain,\" that's when I left. \nVENKMAN I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional. \nHe leaves her and crosses to Spengler. \nSPENGLER \nHe's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby with a tape measure and calipers. \nVENKMAN What are you going to do, Egon?  Knit him a snowsuit? \nSpengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar. \nSPENGLER I'd like to have a stool specimen \nVENKMAN Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons? \nVENKMAN (picking up the baby) Okay, kid.  Up you go. \n", "test2_true": "VENKMAN Help!  Please somebody help me!  Get him off! Quickly!  He's gone completely berserk! \nDana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby. \nDANA What do you think? \nVENKMAN There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly. (resumes playing with the baby) You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled. (to Dana) What's his name? \nDANA His name is Oscar. \nVENKMAN Oscar!  You poor kid! \nDANA (losing patience) Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him. \nVENKMAN Unusual? (holds up the baby and scrutinizes him) I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies. \nHe looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper off. \nDANA (taking the specimen jar) I'll do it. \nVENKMAN I'll supervise. \nINT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NURSERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nVenkman enters and finds Stantz monitoring the room. \nVENKMAN (to Stantz) Well, Holmes, what do you think? \nSTANTZ It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now. \nSpengler enters. \nVENKMAN (to Spengler) What now, Brainiac? \nSPENGLER I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street. \nVENKMAN Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER) \nDana walks down the street with Venkman, retracing the path of the runaway buggy.  Spengler and Stantz follow, monitoring PKE valences from the pavement and the buildings. \nVENKMAN (to Dana, nostalgic) Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it? (pointing out familiar neighborhood sights) There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store. (he wipes away an imaginary tear) We really had some good times, didn't we? \nDANA We definitely had a moment or two. \nDana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street. \nDANA That's where the buggy stopped. \nVENKMAN Okay, let's take a look. \nVenkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill.  Then he signals for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street. \nSTANTZ (reading the PKE meter) Is this the spot? \nDANA A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped. \nStantz reads the PKE meter. \nSTANTZ Nothing.  Not a trace. \nSPENGLER Why don't we try the Giga-meter? \nVENKMAN What's that? \nSTANTZ Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts. \nSPENGLER That's a thousand million electron volts. \nVENKMAN I knew that. \nSpengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped. The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING WILDLY. \nSTANTZ I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street. \nDANA (worried, to Venkman) Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things. \n", "test2_id": 973, "test3_input": "The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers. \nSPENGLER (monitoring valences) Full neutronas, maser assist. \nThey adjust their settings and prepare to fire. \nSTANTZ Throw 'em! \nThey trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime. \nVENKMAN (to the firemen) Okay, who knows \"Cumbaya?\" \nA few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands.  Venkman grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum. \nVENKMAN All right.  Nice and sweet -- (starts singing) Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya -- \nStantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding hands and swaying to the music. \nALL (singing) Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya. \nStantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime. \nSTANTZ Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff. \nVENKMAN Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray? \nSPENGLER It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell. \nSTANTZ I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it. \nSPENGLER We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol -- \nHis eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a line drawing of the Statue of Liberty. \nSTANTZ (he sees it, too) Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us -- \nSPENGLER Something good -- \nVENKMAN And pure -- \nWINSTON And decent. \nEXT.  THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nThere is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives with a police escort.  Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor himself and they cross to the museum entrance. \nHardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the Ghostbusters. \nHARDEMEYER Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control. \nVENKMAN Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one. \nMAYOR Are you telling me there're people trapped in there? \nHARDEMEYER (to his assistant) This is dynamite.  Call A.P., U.P.I., and C.N.N. and get them down here right away. When the police bring this kid out I want them to hand it right to the mayor and I want it all on camera. \nSTANTZ Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by midnight, you're going to go down in history as the man who let New York get sucked down into the tenth level of hell. \nThe Mayor stops to consider the situation. \nMAYOR (to the Fire Captain) Can you get into that museum? \nFIRE CAPTAIN If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe. \nThe Mayor turns to Venkman. \nMAYOR You know why all these things are happening? \nVENKMAN We tried to tell you last night, but Mr. Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony bin. \nHardemeyer flips out. \nHARDEMEYER This is preposterous!  You can't seriously believe all this mumbo-jumbo!  It's the Twentieth Century, for crying out loud! (viciously, to Venkman) Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff is or how you got it all over the museum, but you better get it off and I mean right now! \nHe pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily through the slime curtain.  Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the slime. \nMAYOR (to Venkman) Okay, just tell me what you need. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "With the city skyline in the b.g., the Ghostbusters prepare their equipment.  Each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks, hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators. Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them. \nVENKMAN Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it? \nWINSTON Wonder what? \nVENKMAN If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know. \nSPENGLER There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons of iron and steel. \nStantz is looking worried. \nSTANTZ I hope we have enough stuff to do the job. \nVENKMAN Only one way to find out. (to Stantz) Ready, Teddy? \nThey enter the statue. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Ghostbusters are working from the iron staircase that spirals straight up 100 feet inside the hollow super-structure of the statue. Spengler and Winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to various relays on the interior surface of the statue.  Venkman and Stantz are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase. They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks and gives the order. \nSTANTZ Okay, boys.  Let's frost it. \nThey begin hosing the inside of the statue with the psycho-reactive slime. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (SAME TIME) \nJanine watches as Louis, wearing a Ghostbuster uniform, slings a heavy proton pack onto his back. \nJANINE I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this? \nLOUIS Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum. \nJANINE You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck. \nShe kisses Louis and he gets extremely self-conscious. \nLOUIS Uh -- oh -- well, I better hurry. \nHe rushes out. \nEXT  STREET OUTSIDE FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER) \nLouis stands on the street corner waiting for a bus.  Finally, a bus pulls up, Louis climbs aboard and finds Slimer behind the wheel. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER \nVenkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are standing in the observation windows in the crown of the statue.  It looks like they're on the bridge of an ocean liner, then the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the head of the statue. \nSTANTZ \nHe plugs the main cable lead into a transformer. \nSTANTZ It's all yours, Pete. (checks his watch) There's not much time left. \nVenkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat. \nVENKMAN (giving the downbeat) Okay, one, two, three, four -- \nHe hits \"Play\" on the Walkman and \"HIGHER AND HIGHER\" BOOMS from the huge SPEAKERS, amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior. \nINT.  OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) \nThe head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to the rail and manage to keep their feet. \nSTANTZ She's moving! \nWINSTON I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk. \nSPENGLER (reading the Giga-meter) We've got full power. \nStantz picks up a Nintendo control paddle from a home video game and starts pushing the buttons. \n", "test3_id": 974}

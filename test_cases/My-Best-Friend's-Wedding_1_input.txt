She looks in his eyes.  Realizing at last. 
JULIANNE You flew all the way h... 
DIGGER I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons. 
JULIANNE (soft) You're butting in. 
He still holds her wrists.  She brings one of his hands to her lips.  Kisses his knuckles. 
JULIANNE (softer) I really resent this. 
INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING 
Julianne seated at the sink, staring into the mirror, as Digger gently applies soup, cloth and water to easing away the mask.  A paleontologist restoring a Bronze Age artifact.  By the side of the half-filled sink, rests her plugged-in curling iron. 
JULIANNE What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit. 
DIGGER You like her. 
JULIANNE If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her. 
She looks up at him and WINCES, as the movement makes him scrape her face.  He's sorry. 
JULIANNE Last night, she was crying, these big, real tears, when she thought she'd lost him.  It was like there was a knife in her heart... 
Looking in his eyes.  Needs him to hear. 
JULIANNE ... and I put it there.  I hated myself, I grieved for her, I couldn't enjoy one second of it! And then, when it didn't work... 
Can you believe this? 
JULIANNE I was devastated. 
DIGGER (softly) Go figure you. 
JULIANNE Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every... 
She holds his wrists now.  To stop him.  To plead for understanding.  Forgiveness. 
JULIANNE ... every time I think of him, forever, which could be a lot. 
She almost choked on that last part.  So she composes herself. 
JULIANNE You watch a guy caress his girlfriend's butt.  You see an Old Spice commercial.  Sentimental moments are everywhere, when you're in the right frame of mind. 
She swallows hard.  Fights for a grip on her determination. 
JULIANNE There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years... 
DIGGER You've been working on this, huh? 
JULIANNE ... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times. 
She sets her jaw. 
JULIANNE This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless. 
DIGGER (quietly) And you believe that. 
JULIANNE (unconvincing) Sure. 
His eyes are gentle and merciless at once.  No way she gets off this hook. 
JULIANNE He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can. 
DIGGER It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about... 
JULIANNE (proudly) I don't know the meaning of the word guilt! 
DIGGER Impressive. 
JULIANNE I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus! 
DIGGER The man you love. 
JULIANNE Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts! 
DIGGER Someday she'll thank you. 
JULIANNE Let's not get carried away. 
And the defenses drain from her clay-ravaged features.  The real Julianne is glimpsed. 
JULIANNE I'd settle for.  Someday, I'll forgive myself. 
For...? 
JULIANNE For doing this terrible thing. 
Her eyes tear up. 
JULIANNE Which, by the way, I can't figure out how to do. 
As the tears fall, he wipes at them, discovering... 
DIGGER Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m... 
JULIANNE I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF! 
Oh. 
JULIANNE Guess what I brushed my teeth with last night? 
He thinks about this.  Following her eyes to the toiletries kit, he browses for a moment...

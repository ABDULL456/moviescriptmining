Final shooting script 
JUNE 5, 1990 
FADE IN: 
INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY) 
LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early- thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the b.g., which she hums along with. 
INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left from last night's dinner which had to "soak".  She is still in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g. 
From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do-it- yourself" attempt by Thelma. 
INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING 
Louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number. 
INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
Phone RINGS.  Thelma goes over to answer it. 
THELMA (hollering) I got it!   Hello. 
INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING 
LOUISE (at pay phone) I hope you're packed, little housewife, 'cause we are outta her tonight. 
INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
THELMA Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go. 
LOUISE (V.O.) You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown. 
Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them.  We see various recipes torn out from women's magazines along the lines of "101 Ways to Cook Pork." 
THELMA He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work? 
LOUISE (V.O.) No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion. 
THELMA I'll call you right back. 
Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister. 
THELMA Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry up. 
DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry.  He manages a Carpeteria. 
DARRYL Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning. 
THELMA I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late. 
Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and 
it's obvious he likes what he sees.  He exudes over-confidence for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think of himself as a real lady killer. 
He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed hair.  Thelma watches approvingly. 
THELMA Hon. 
DARRYL What. 
THELMA (she decides not to tell him) Have a good day at work today. 
DARRYL Uh-huh. 
THELMA Hon? 
DARRYL What?! 
THELMA You want anything special for dinner? 
DARRYL No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are. 
THELMA Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend. 
DARRYL Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am. 
He's finally ready.  He walks to the door and gives Thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.

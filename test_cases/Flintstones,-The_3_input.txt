270   CONTINUED:                                                 270 WILMA Oh, Fred -- that's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard! They kiss... she drops to safety...! 
271   BELOW                                                      271 
Wilma slides into a rescue net, gets on unsteady feet next to Betty. 
272   BACK UPSTAIRS                                             272 FRED Lhet's dogh it! 
Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake... both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole pulley mechanism falls right down between them and through the hole! A second later, the entire remaining structure collapses! 273   BELOW                                                      273 Everyone reacts in horror -- 274   ABOVE                                                      274 
Dust and smoke clear. When we can see again, well, it's not a pretty sight. The entire fibresphere is gone. All that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of rubble too small for a human to negotiate... and all that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the ground! 
275   CLOSER                                                     275 Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It's all they can do. 276   BELOW                                                      276 
Wilma and Betty gasp... what can be done? 277   THE SECOND ISLAND                                         277 
Bricks and chunks of Fibre stir... a form sits up... it's -- Dino! He looks around at the situation, becomes agitated... he wants to help... but how? 
278   WILMA AND BETTY                                            278 Suddenly become inspired. 
BETTY W-wilma... those hoops of bamboo... those wires... do you think -- ? 
WILMA Yes! Yes! Betty, we have to try it -- ! Dino! Dino, look down here -- ! 
279   DINO                                                         279 Obeys, puzzled -- 
280   HIS POV - WILMA AND BETTY                                  280 
Amazingly, they grab scraps of wood, borrow fire fighter's helmets, and begin to do a buck and wing. WILMA   AND   BETTY You can keep   the   twist, the frug and   hop I don't need   to shimmy, I don't need   to bop -- 281   BIG CAMERA PUSH - DINO                                     281 MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly bridge that leads to his master and friends. 282   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              282 
Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island! Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to Barney -- and then -- 
283   LONG SHOT                                                    283 -- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net as Wilma and Betty wind up! 
WILMA AND BETTY Yes, I don't need to shimmy, I don't need to bop 'Cause I'm doin', doin', doin' THE IGNEOUS ROCK! 
284   FRED                                                         284 rolls out of the net and away from the others. He's slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up... suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up and sees -- 285   HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS                       285 
All with weapons aimed right at him. Spotlights on the police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys.

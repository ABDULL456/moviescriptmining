CHIP and MISTY look at one another and stick fingers down their throats at mention of MRS. ACKERMAN'S name. 
ROSEMARY ACKERMAN runs in from kitchen in hysterics. 
MRS. ACKERMAN Turn on the news! (To CHIP) A teacher at your school has been murdered! 
MISTY (Appalled) Murdered? 
CHIP Who? 
MRS. ACKERMAN A Mr. Stubber...or Stubbins. 
CHIP (Horrified) MR. STUBBINS?  That's my math teacher! 
28.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN LIVING ROOM. 
DAD runs in and turns on TV as family and MRS. ACKERMAN follow and watch under MOM's framed portrait on wail. 
DAD What channel? 
MRS. ACKERMAN It's on all of them! 
Phone rings.  CHIP grabs the receiver. 
CHIP Hello. 
We see BIRDIE in split screen. 
BIRDIE (Excited) Did you hear? 
CHIP What happened? 
BIRDIE This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie. 
ANNOUNCER comes on TV. 
CHIP It's on!  I'll call you back! (Hangs up) 
ANNOUNCER ..Police claim the driver of the hit and run vehicle ran down the teacher in cold blood and then backed up over his body to finish off the job. Mr. Paul Stubbins was thirty-eight years old... 
DAD (Mad) Whoever did it should get the death penalty! 
MOM yawns absentmindedly. 
ANNOUNCER ...So far only one eyewitness has surfaced. 
MOM looks up in sudden fear as LU-ANN, the trashy pot-smoking girl who witnessed murder appears on screen. 
LUANN It was a blue car...I know that much! 
CHIP That's Lu-Ann Hodges! 
MISTY She's a pothead! 
LUANN ...A blue station wagon... 
MRS. ACKERMAN That's like your car, Beverly, 
MOM (Glaring at MRS. ACKERMAN) I'm not that bad a driver. (Disapprovingly at TV screen) Look at her hair! (To CHIP) Turn it off, honey. 
CHIP (He does) (In shock) I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead. 
MISTY You said you hated him. 
CHIP Well...he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!

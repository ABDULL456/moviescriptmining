LUKE You know of the Rebellion against the Empire? 
THREEPIO That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir. 
LUKE Have you been in many battles? 
THREEPIO Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. 
Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint. He uses a larger pick. 
LUKE Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... 
The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three- dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe. 
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. 
LUKE What's this? 
Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over. 
THREEPIO What is what?!? He asked you a question... (pointing to Leia) What is that? 
Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over. 
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. 
THREEPIO Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. 
Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl. 
LUKE Who is she? She's beautiful. 
THREEPIO I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. 
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... 
THREEPIO I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... 
LUKE Is there more to this recording? 
Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle. 
THREEPIO Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master. 
Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio. 
THREEPIO He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. 
LUKE Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? 
THREEPIO I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? 
LUKE Well, I don't know anyone named Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. 
Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments. 
LUKE I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing. 
Artoo beeps something to Threepio. 
THREEPIO He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. 
Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying. 
LUKE H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. 
Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo's side. 
LUKE There you go. 
The princess immediately disappears... 
LUKE Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. 
Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment. 
THREEPIO What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! 
A women's voice calls out from another room. 
AUNT BERU Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! 
Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot. 
LUKE All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. 
THREEPIO I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. 
Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room. 
LUKE Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. 
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Just you reconsider playing that message for him. 
Artoo beeps in response. 
THREEPIO No, I don't think he likes you at all. 
Artoo beeps. 
THREEPIO No, I don't like you either. 
INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA 
Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well- used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area. 
Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain. 
LUKE You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. 
OWEN What makes you think that?

ME Attack of the Atomic Vampires... 
GLENDA BLEDSOE (smiles, no flinch) We can't all be Audrey Hepburn. Plus it pays bills. 
ME Better than a billionaire does? Go make amends and finish out your service contract Ms. Bledsoe. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE Not if there was just one day left on it. 
ME Why? 
GLENDA BLEDSOE I'm better than that. 
ME You're also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick that'll never see a screen, regardless if it's leading lady gets `kidnapped' or not.                              * 
Drop that coffee cup from the other night into her bag. She's beat, but bluffs by. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE This isn't the first time you've spied on me. 
ME Nor the second. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE (beat) Well you've got me all giftwrapped, Enforcer- 
ME -Dave. You're on Hughes' bad side Ms. Bledsoe. It's not a bright place to be. So please go- 
GLENDA BLEDSOE -Glenda. (this smile just for me) And tell Howard I'll take my chances with the fake vampires. 
And she twirls off, gone...watch her go...my radio buzzes. 
ME Klein. Go ahead...                                      * 
DISPATCH Message from a Lester Lake: asked that you contact him immediately. 
Ignition. Gas. Tires catch smoke as I peel away. 
40   EXT. PASADENA PAYPHONE - DAY                                 40 
Out of dimes, drop slugs instead. Three rings, somebody snags it before the fourth. Background reverb blares, bar racket. Hear a muted male growl `Club Alabam...' 
ME Get me Lester. This is Lieutenant Klein, LAPD- 
-click. Fuck. Fish for another slug. Redial. One ring. Picked up, same background din- 
ME (CONT'D) (push this out pronto) -this is LAPD-put Lester on the phone or I'll have your liquor license and after-hours permits yanked inside the hour... 
A muffled back and forth before Lester comes on the line: 
LESTER LAKE Dave? 
ME Got your message. 
INTERCUT:                                                     * 
LESTER LAKE Girl that works here, gigs the late sets, the torch stuff Fridays and                 * Saturdays, name of Tilly Hopwell.                 * 
ME I saw her singing the other night. 
LESTER LAKE I think she's been truckin' with Tommy Mag. Got pipes like Ella but she's a junk fiend: caught her                    * mainlining in the ladies room a month back.                                       * 
ME Heroin? Tommy get her hooked? 
LESTER LAKE Dunno, but when he'd get drunk,                   * he'd trade Horse for blowjobs out                 * back a' the club.                                 * 
ME Where's this girl now?                            * 
LESTER LAKE Didn't show up for work last night.               * Called a friend of hers, a waitress that works here too, said she was                 * at Bido Lito's in Hollywood. Said                 * she was `hiding out.' 
ME She actually said `hiding out?'                   * 
LESTER LAKE Then she got off the phone. Fast. If Tilly's running with that demon,               * you gotta get her out of there. She               * got a lot more good in her than not-              * 
-Hang up. Paw the phone book. Tear out the address for Bido   * Lito's. 
41   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - DAY                                41    * 
Driving. 
ME (V.O.) Smart Tommy. Dodging Darktown altogether. Holed up in Hollywood. Hiding in plain sight.

At the bottom of the mirror, a FADED POSTCARD has been tucked between the frame and the glass. Ashe pulls it free, studying it... 
CLOSE ON POSTCARD 
A carnival midway set on the beach, people strolling along a boardwalk, golden sand and blue skies. WORDS at the top of the picture read: "WISH YOU WERE HERE". 
ASHE 
I've been here. 
Ashe stares at the picture, entranced, caught up in a moment of wistful nostalgia for the life he's lost. 
ASHE 
I took Danny last summer. We went up on the bike, rode all the way up the coast... 
(BEAT) 
It was cold up there. I remember we could see each other's breath. 
Ashe catches himself, setting the postcard down. He turns his back to Sarah, hiding his face form her, overcome by emotion. 
Sarah stands, drawing near. She reaches out to console him, touching his shoulder. She alone, among all the souls of the world, understands the isolation that is consuming Ashe. 
SARAH 
Look at me. 
But Ashe won't. 
SARAH 
Ashe. Look at me. 
Ashe finally turns around, a sense of deep and profound loss in his eyes... 
Something unspoken passes between them. Sarah leans into Ashe, tentative, eyes searching. It's one of those fragile moments where things could go either way. And then... 
ASHE 
(pulling back) 
No... 
(turning away) 
We can't do this... 
The spell has been broken. Ashe starts away from her. 
ASHE 
I have to finish what I started. I have to find the others. 
SARAH 
I know. 
Ashe moves to the door, hesitant, a terrible sense of longing gnawing at his heart. 
SARAH 
I wish I'd met you before. 
Ashe nods, then turns to leave. There's nothing else to say. 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Sarah watches from her window as Ashe strides to his motorcycle. She raises her hand up, as if to say good-bye. 
EXT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
As Ashe climbs aboard his bike, he catches sight of himself in the... 
DISPLAY WINDOW OF A BAKERY 
Within the bakery are mountains of sugar skulls, candy skeletons, and pan de muerte (bread of the dead). Ashe's reflection is superimposed over this morbid tableau. 
Ashe fires up the bike's engine. He takes off down the street... 
CUT TO: 
INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT 
Judah moves back to the stag beetle, watching its Sisyphean efforts. SCRITCH! SCRITCH! 
JUDAH 
So the Crow is Ashe's familiar...

117     EXT. DESERT - DAY 
The vehicle is now approaching the Sphinx.  Both it and the pyramids can be seen some distance away. 
Voice are heard in CU perspective. 
MELINA So what can we do? 
QUAIL Ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead of schedule - while the inhabitants are still here. 
Melina is amazed. 
MELINA But who'll work the machine? Do you know how? 
QUAIL I'm the only one who does. Why do you think Cohaagen's left me alone all this time? 
118     EXT. DESERT - DAY 
The vehicle is even closer to the Sphinx. 
QUAIL I was the first one inside when they cracked the riddle of the Sphinx.  It must've been programmed.  Some kind of...force...shot into me. 
MELINA But Cohaagen wiped your memory!!! 
QUAIL (smoothly) Just a way of putting me on ice.  He'd of reversed it once the planet was evacuated. 
BENNIE Man!  This is real complicated. Go over it again, real slow. 
119     INT. VEHICLE - DAY 
QUAIL (ignoring Bennie's aside) What he hadn't counted on was your effect on me. 
MELINA (smiling) And all without the marvels of modern science! 
Quail looks out the back window, his attention attracted by two patrol vehicles.  They are some distance away, but approaching steadily. 
119A    EXT. DESERT - DAY 
A wide shot shows a total of four patrol vehicles approach- ing the vehicle with Quail, Melina and Bennie.  Suddenly, it stops moving. 
120     INT. VEHICLE - DAY 
The vehicle had just stopped. 
QUAIL Bennie, don't stop now, take it... 
He turns to see Bennie is covering him and Melina with a pistol. 
MELINA You bastard. 
BENNIE Like I said.  It's a tough planet.  I'm a baddie, not a goodie. 
QUAIL I should have known, you were just too helpful. 
BENNIE EIO Rule One, man.  Trust Nobody.  Now you can do your terriforming stuff right when those space shuttles are gone. 
MELINA But what about the Martian people?  Out cause?  I thought you believed in it. 
BENNIE Your cause?  That bunch of dead beat radicals!  When I hand in this little number... (flicks his gun in Quail's face) ...I'll get real estate rights on the whole of Chryse Planitia... 
At that instant, Melina lunges, PUNCHES A RED EMERGENCY BUTTON.  The VENT beside Bennie's hand BLOWS OPEN, [causing] a powerful suction caused by Mars's vacuum atmosphere. Bennie's gun hand is PLANTED AGAINST THE VENT [OPENING.]

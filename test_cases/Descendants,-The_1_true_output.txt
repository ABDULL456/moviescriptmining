MATT What party? 
BRIAN SPEER Super Bowl party. 
MATT (figuring it out) At the Mitchells'. 
BRIAN SPEER Does that help? Does that make it better?

MATT Hey, I'm doing you a favor here. I could go out there right now and fuck you up, so get a better attitude. Then what? How'd you get the nerve to ask her out? 
Brian drops his head, rubs his temples. 
MATT (CONT'D) I want to know what makes a person cross that line. Was it about the deal? Is that when you decided she was for you? 
BRIAN SPEER No, no. It's not what you think.     It just happened. 
MATT Nothing just happens. 
BRIAN SPEER Everything just happens. 
MATT Was she going to leave me? 
BRIAN SPEER She would have. But I, I, uh... I didn't want that. That wouldn't have happened. I love Julie. (anguished) Please don't tell her. Please. I don't know what I've done. I'm sorry. 
MATT Did she say she loved you? 
Brian nods slightly. 
MATT (CONT'D) Do you love her? 
Brian looks down. 
MATT (CONT'D) You don't love her. You don't love her. You just used her to get to me. 
BRIAN SPEER No, I told you. I wasn't trying to get to you. (MORE) (CONTINUED) The Descendants     PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 110   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 110 BRIAN SPEER (CONT'D) It was an affair, an attraction. Sex. And she got sort of... carried away with the whole thing, and I guess I went with it. I mean, I didn't exactly say no to things. I should have. I love my family. 
MATT Then I guess it's all working out. Her lips are sealed, and you don't have to go through the trouble of dumping her. 
BRIAN SPEER Hey, hey, that's really unfair. I had - - have -- a lot of respect for her. She's a wonderful woman. 
MATT Too bad her husband found out. You can't win `em all. One more question. Have you ever been inside my bedroom? 
BRIAN SPEER (tortured) Once. 
MATT You could have had the decency to lie about that one. Well, she's in Queen's Hospital if you want to say goodbye. That really is all I came to say. 
BRIAN SPEER Shouldn't you be with her? 
Matt's face slackens into overwhelming sadness. 
111   EXT. HANALEI BAY COTTAGE - NIGHT                               111 
Matt swings the screen door open. Alex sits with Julie. Skylar and Colt are still running around the yard. 
MATT Yeah, great, all remodeled, new appliances. Nice. Alex, we should be getting back. 
JULIE Well, hey, thanks for stopping by. Really nice to meet you both. Maybe we'll see you at the beach tomorrow.

ALEXANDRA Yeah, maybe. 
After Alex and Julie share a quick kiss goodbye -- a common custom in Hawaii -- Julie turns to Matt. 
Matt leans in, but instead of going for her cheek, he kisses her FULLY ON THE LIPS. 
He pulls away, and they exchange a brief, vaguely erotic look. Then he turns away and into the night. 
112   INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT                                            112 
The plane is dark except for overhead READING LIGHTS. Again Matt, Sid and the girls sit at the very BACK OF THE PLANE. 
ALEXANDRA So when do you think he'll show up? 
MATT I have no idea. 
Sid leans forward from the middle seat.

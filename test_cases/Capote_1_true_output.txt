The Guard lets Truman out of the cell. 
PERRY Please don't go out there. 
The Guard shuts the door. 
TRUMAN This is my work, Perry. I'm working. When you want to tell me what I need to hear, you let me know. 
He walks off down the hall. The GATE slams shut.

INT. PERRY'S SISTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
Cheaply built ranch house. LINDA MURCHAK (30) walks in the kitchen back door, shuts it. 
MRS. MURCHAK They'll play outside a while longer. 
Mrs. Murchak looks like a female Perry, dark and small, attractive and nervous. Through the window, we see THREE LITTLE CHILDREN playing on a DECREPIT JUNGLE GYM in the yard. Truman sits at the table, leafing through a PHOTO ALBUM. 
MRS. MURCHAK I don't want them to see that. 
TRUMAN They've never seen these pictures? 
MRS. MURCHAK (shakes her head) Too many questions. 
She joins Truman again at the table. 
We see an OLD PHOTO of the SMITH FAMILY -- Linda at age 8, Perry (5); their older sister, June; their brother Frank; and the parents: Florence (American Indian) and John (Irish) -- in front of their rundown truck on a desolate road. 
MRS. MURCHAK June's dead. Frank shot himself. Now Perry's did what he did. I suppose I'm next. Some ruination will visit me. 
TRUMAN I don't think life works that way. 
MRS. MURCHAK It does in this family. 
Truman turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (3) and Linda HOLDING HANDS and splashing in a big mud-puddle in the rain. Linda is smiling at Perry, who is naked, laughing. 
MRS. MURCHAK I used to love him. He was my little doll. 
He turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (6) and Linda sitting on the back steps of a shack, poking with a stick at something in the dirt. After a moment, she gets up, clears coffee cups. 
MRS. MURCHAK He scares me now. 
TRUMAN When was the last time you saw him? 
MRS. MURCHAK Ten years. 
She picks up the album to put it away. 
TRUMAN Do you think I could borrow one of those pictures? 
MRS. MURCHAK (hands it to him) Take the whole thing. I don't want'em anymore. (then) Just... Perry doesn't know where I live. He thinks we're still in Portland. Please don't tell him we're not. 
TRUMAN (he already has) Alright. 
MRS. MURCHAK Don't be taken in by my brother. He's got this sensitive side he'll show. You believe he's gentle, so easily hurt. But he'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand. I believe that. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - NEXT DAY 
Truman slows for a moment as he passes Hickock's cell. 
TRUMAN Hello handsome. 
Hickock just stares at him. Truman, unnerved, moves on to Perry's cell. 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS 
Perry doing pushups. He sees Truman and stops. He stands. The Row Guard approaches. 
ROW GUARD You want to go in? 
Truman regards Perry for a few moments, then: 
TRUMAN Yes

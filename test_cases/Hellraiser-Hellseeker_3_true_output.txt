Trevor looks relieved. Shell-shocked but relieved. 
TREVOR I'm certainly keeping you busy huh? 
ALLISON (smiling) Too bad I hate my job... 
She strokes his forehead. 
ALLISON (CONT'D) Feeling better now? 
Trevor shakes his head. 
TREVOR These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way. 
ALLISON Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it? 
TREVOR If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up. 
ALLISON Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please. 
TREVOR I miss her. I miss my wife. 
Trevor takes her hand. Allison looks briefly around her then... climbs onto the bed with him. 
ALLISON If you need to cry, go ahead. I won't tell. 
Holding her hand to his face, Trevor closes his eyes, squeezing out a tear. 
CLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE. WE start to NOTICE subtle differences about Allison's hand. It is very pale, the fingernails black. 
Trevor opens his eyes. 
INT. TAWNY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING 
He is now lying on Tawny's bed, which is surrounded by unlit candles. Sunlight streams through her open window. It is her hand he is holding to his face. The rest of her is sitting under the sheet, covered head propped against the headboard. 
Trevor drops her hand and it falls lifelessly to the bed beside him. Breathing quickening he reaches up to the black silk sheet covering her head. He yanks it back and covers his mouth in horror. 
She's been bound to the bed and gagged with a white cloth that is soaked with blood. A deep vertical incision has been made in her neck, collarbone to chin and her tongue is pulled through the wound so it sticks out the bottom of her jaw. And that's just for starters. 
When Trevor looks down he gags when he sees her ribcage has been opened like a set of French doors and her insides sitting in her lap. 
The coup de grace? Trevor now sees he is covered with blood. HERS. 
INT. TREVOR'S APT., BATHROOM - DAY 
Trevor splashes his face with cold water, trying to get his composure back. He stares at the water rushing down the drain for a moment. His breathing stabilizes He finally looks up at his reflection in the mirror... 
... to see PINHEAD staring back at him. 
Trevor jolts backward in shock and does a double take. It's him now, looking completely unhinged. 
Outside the PHONE RINGS. The answering machine picks up with a BEEP. 
LANGE'S VOICE (from answering machine) This is Lange. We need to talk as soon as possible. It's about your little... dilemma. Give me a call. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Cleaned up now Trevor carefully makes his way back to Tawny's apartment. He tries the door. It's locked. This can't be right. He jiggles the door knob violently, then finally KICKS the door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Suddenly- 
-TAWNY answers the door, looking utterly pissed off. Though still in Goth mode, she's dressed much more conservatively now. 
TAWNY Can I help you? 
TREVOR Tawny... I- you're- 
Trevor goes to embrace her. She shrinks back, startled. 
TAWNY Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?

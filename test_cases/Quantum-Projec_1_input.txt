The old sash falls shut.  BOOM.  It's like a dam bursting inside him, only the flood is LAUGHTER that starts deep in his belly, as a giggle, then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into enormous GUFFAWS.  The sound rocks the house.  Pentcho's smile is a mile wide. His eyes sparkle, then tear up as the 
FRONT DOORBELL RINGS 
He jumps off the bed, and bounds down the stairs. 
53     INT. THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT                             53 
Alexander's already there, ushering MIA inside to: 
54     INT.  THE LIVING ROOM - AT THE MOMENT THAT              54 
Pentcho arrives.  He stops, incredulous, at the sight of her. 
ALEXANDER Guess who's coming to dinner. 
Mia jumps right in.  To Pentcho: 
MIA I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time. 
PENTCHO Wait.  I want to tell you something. 
He takes her arm, steering her away from Alexander, into the living room.  She stops cold at the sight of the MURAL.

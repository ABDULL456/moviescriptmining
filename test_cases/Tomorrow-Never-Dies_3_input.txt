INT. GARAGE - HARMSWAY TOWERS. 
Bond and Sidney come out near a TROLLEY stacked with newspapers. 
Hearts pounding - having left the pressroom's deafening noise - they're ready for almost anything, except what they HEAR: 
The SOUND OF ONE MAN APPLAUDING. A polite, almost bored clapping. 
HARMSWAY (O.S.) Vert, very, good Mr. Bond. Outstanding performance. 
Harmsway is standing with TEN GUARDS, shoulder to shoulder, in a straight line, all HOLDING WEAPONS on Sidney and Bond. 
HARMSWAY (continuing) I'm the certain the British taxpayers would be impressed by your efforts. Don't you agree? 
BOND I think they'd rather know who stole their gold. 
Harmsway can't help his ego: 
HARMSWAY (chuckles) Why, I did, of course. It's on the Sea Dolphin II, twenty miles outside of Hong Kong... Not that it will do either of you any good to know. (beat) Now both of you: Stand up. And toss the gun out, Mr. Bond. 
Bond SLIDES THE GUN several feet in front of him... And THROWS A LOOK TO HIS CAR, noting THE GUARDS ARE LINED UP DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH. Bond begins to scheme. 
SIDNEY Uncle Elliot: How could you do this to me? 
Bond sneaks his hand in his pocket. 
HARMSWAY Oh, please, Sidney. There's a hundred billion dollars at stake. (beat) Besides, I never really liked your father that much. He cheated at cards. 
Bond has removed the CAR REMOTE CONTROL. He palms it. 
BOND Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl? 
HARMSWAY My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain. (beat) Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward. 
Holding the remote control, Bond puts his hands on his head. He's manipulating the control into the right position to use it. 
BOND (trying to buy time) What did you do, Harmsway? Make some deal with the Chinese government for the gold?.. Was the radioactive uranium I found in Venice part of it? 
He finally has the remote control in the right position. 
HARMSWAY Questions, questions, Mr. Bond... Which I'm afraid I've neither the time, nor the inclination to answer. (to the guards) Take them out to the jungle and - 
Suddenly, BOND'S CAR ENGINE STARTS WITH A ROAR. The GUARDS TURN, in shock TOWARDS THE CAR, as: 
BOND retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls Sidney behind the newspaper trolley, while - 
THE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE, sending the guards scrambling. 
BOND takes his position with Sidney. 
BOND I forgot to mention: The job comes with a car. 
007 begins shooting, as - 
HARMSWAY Kill it! Shoot the damn thing - 
THE GUARDS START BLASTING THE EMPTY MOVING CAR. They manage to shoot out the headlights, while - 
BOND is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same time. As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them - 
BOND Here. You shoot. I'll drive. 
SIDNEY ...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship. 
BOND Another reason??? Did I miss something??? 
SIDNEY (taking the gun) You insist on calling all the shots. (beat) And by the way: I am not a helpless girl. 
Bond eyes her for one split second. Points at the guards: 
BOND Aim that way. 
Sidney starts to shoot as - 
THE GUARDS continue to blast away at the car... But: 
THE WINDOWS DON'T SHATTER. 
THE ARMOR-PLATED SIDE-PANELS ONLY DENT WITH BULLET HITS... 
THE TIRES DON'T GO FLAT. 
There's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as BOND STEERS THE CAR TO THEIR POSITION, where the door opens automatically. 
BOND Ready? Now! 
The two of them make a break for the car, DIVING INSIDE. 
INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - GARAGE - 
- Bond guns the engine, slams the transmission into gear. Burning rubber, GUARDS bounce off the front fenders. 
THE GUARDS - 
Continue to shoot at the car. 
OTHER GUARDS - 
Run for the HUM-VEES. Hop in and chase. 
INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) - 
Bond flips open a hidden control panel. Flips a switch. 
EXT. BACK OF BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) - 
The TAIL-LIGHTS DROP DOWN and MACHINE GUNS start to fire. 
INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) - 
Bond glances at the REARVIEW MIRROR. Sees the HUM-VEES. Presses another switch - 
CLOSE ON BOND'S EXHAUST PIPE - 
Whoosh! A MISSILE blasts out, trailing smoke as it hones in on - 
THE FIRST HUM-VEE. 
BOOM! It's decimated. 
ANGLE ON HARMSWAY - ON HIS RADIO - 
HARMSWAY Seal the garage! Cut the power! He's got no headlamps! 
INT. GARAGE - FIRST TURN - 
As the car screeches around a corner, the overhead lights go out. 
INT. BOND'S CAR - 
Bond flips down the visor: A THERMAL IMAGING DISPLAY drops down.

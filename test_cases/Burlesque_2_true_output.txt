- ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, yet another set of costumes. Ali's as good as anyone else up there. AN AUDIENCE MEMBER crosses frame and we WIPE TO: - ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, another set of costumes. Ali knows the steps now, she's not thinking about them. She's all performance, vamping to the audience, selling like crazy. She NAILS a final layout on a chair, it's flawless. Tess and Sean are watching from the wings. They notice the extra whip in Ali's head, the bump in her grind. 
SEAN Admit it. You like her. It kills you, but you like her. Tess meets his eye, then walks away. The number ends. The girls rush offstage and peel their costumes off. 
ALI My tits are up around my ears, my thong's about a mile up up ass, this corset is so tight, I haven't breathed since Tuesday and these lashes are thick enough to kick up a stiff wind. 
SEAN It's fun being a girl, huh? 
ALI 
(BIG SMILE) Yeah. She hands him the last bits of her costume. FOLLOW Ali as she heads to the dressing room. As she grabs her T-shirt and jeans: 
JESSE I'm starving, who wants to go grab some pizza before the next show? A general chorus of "Yeah?" and "I'm in." FOLLOW Ali to the bathroom as she throws on her clothes and washes off her make-up, humming "Rich Man's Frug" to herself. She heads back out to the dressing room to find: EVERYONE IS GONE. She looks around. Feels like an fool. She plunks down in a chair. Drops her bag on the floor. Looks at herself in the mirror. 
She sees a picture of A CLASSIC BURLESQUE BEAUTY taped to the mirror. Notices her eye make-up -- strong, thick eyeliner. Ali picks up a brush, dips it in eyeliner, and tries to duplicate the look on her own eye. After a first try: 
TESS (O.S.) Your brush is for shit. She turns and sees Tess in the doorway. Tess comes over, takes Ali's brush. Looks at it. 
TESS (CONT'D) Where'd you get this, the 99 cent store? She chucks it in the trash. 
ALI Hey. 
TESS Make-up is like wine. The good stuff costs a fortune but is worth every penny. Where is everyone? 
ALI All the girls went out for pizza. 
TESS Aren't you one of the girls? 
ALI Apparently not. Tess reads her like a book. Knows what went down. She turns to leave, then pauses at the door. Turns back. 
TESS Don't take it personally. Their love's the kind you gotta earn. Ali meets her eyes in the mirror. Then Tess grabs a brush from her own station, tosses it to Ali. 
TESS (CONT'D) Dip it in water first, or you'll never get a clean line. She leaves Ali alone. 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 
Jack enters in boxers, kicks them off, opens the shower, then freezes. 
JACK 
ALI!!! 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Ali is just waking up. 
JACK Your stupid cat peed in the tub! 
ALI What...? (sees the window closed) You closed the window, what do you expect? 
JACK Your cat pees in the house, and it's my_ fault?! Ali scoops the cat up. 
ALI Awwww. Poor guy, you must have been desperate. 
JACK Goddamn cat. And you used my towel again. (then, pointed) How's that apartment hunting coming? He GRABS the newspaper and tosses it in front of her-- she glares at him, then glances at the paper-- 
ALI 
(EYES WIDENING) A thousand bucks for a studio? 
JACK Can you really put a price on privacy? Freedom? Your own bathroom? With clean towels? 
ALI Okay, Jack-- I get it-- His cell phone rings. As he checks who's calling: 
JACK Natalie. (then, into phone:) Hey, baby, how are you? He heads into the bedroom, closes the door. Ali shakes her head, begins to peruse the classifieds. 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY 
Ali, in pajamas, is at the table, combing the classified apartment ads. The cat is beside her. 
ALI Guest studio, Hollywood, $900, with a yard, and -- oh. No pets. (to the cat) Screw them. She scans the ads some more. Finds a good one. 
ALI (CONT'D) Ooh? Jack walks in. Looks like he's got something on his mind. 
ALI (CONT'D) I think I found my new place. Where's Pomona? 
JACK Go to Hell, turn left, it's three miles down on the right. 
ALI Really. How's Beachwood Canyon? 
JACK Great, if you have a car. 
(BEAT) Truth is, you should get a car first. This is L.A. You don't exist without a car. Plus, you can't really afford a decent place yet. 
(THINKING) Tell you what.

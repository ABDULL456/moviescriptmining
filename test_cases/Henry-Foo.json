{"train": "HENRY FOOL \nWritten by \nHal Hartley \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY \nA garbage truck roars by and... \nSimon Grim hangs from the back of it. He is a shy, skinny and terrified-looking guy around thirty years old. \nThe truck rumbles to a halt and Simon climbs down off it to go punch out at the time clock. \nEXT. BEHIND THE WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nMoments later. \nHe comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his beer. \nHe begins to relax. This is his quality private time. \nThen he hears something and looks up. \nHe peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances and sees... \nTwo teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and having sex. \nSimon looks on, intrigued, as Warren smokes, then... \nWARREN (to Amy) You want some? \nAmy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up. \nSimon is fascinated. He drinks and looks on as... \nAmy grins up foolishly at Warren and lowers the pipe. The boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girl's skirt. \nSimon can't believe this. He looks around to see if the coast is clear, then returns just in time to see... \nWarren takes Amy by the waist and enter her. \nThe pipe falls from the young girl's hand. \nWarren throws his head back and grinds himself into her. \nSimon's mouth falls open in awe. \nBut Amy tosses her head back to the side and sees... \nThe amazed garbage man; caught. \nAmy starts screaming insanely. \nSimon runs for his life. \nAmy and Warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they chase him away. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nMoments later. \nSimon runs up and throws open the screen door. He stands there in the doorway catching his breath. \nHis sister, Fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small portable TV while their mother, Mary, sits a few feet away in the living-room watching another TV tuned to a different channel. \nFAY (to Simon) Where the hell have you been? (to Mary) Mom, come on and eat. \nMARY I'm not hungry. \nFAY (pissed) Then why'd I cook! \nMary is a manic-depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in the evening. \nMARY I don't know why you cooked! I don't know why you bother! \nFay holds her head in her hands and sighs. She glares at her brother. \nFAY Sit down and eat, Simon. \nSimon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl of some sort of gruel. He hesitates, then lifts his spoon. Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. Fay gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the bowl and eats some more. \nPushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container of milk on the table and drinks straight from it. \nHe suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of cheese roll out. \nHe stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach while... \nFay and Mary look on in disgust. \nEXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nMoments later. \nSimon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach and spits, sickened. \nHe looks up, though, and sees... \nA little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing there in the street watching him. \nSimon tries to smile at her. \nBut she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head. \nThat evening. \nSimon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of soiled classics. He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and tries to read. It's an obvious struggle. He puts it aside and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture of the pages. A page flutters away and he climbs down to the edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. It's now wet and torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit it back into the book. \nHe reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. He bites his lip and tries again. \nHe sits back, exhausted and thinks. He hears a twig snap and looks back over his shoulder to see... \nAmy throws a bottle at his head. \nSmash!!!! He falls to the ground, blood streaming down his neck. \nWarren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out of the puddle and smacking him in the head. \nAmy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper which she sets aflame with her lighter. \nWarren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to the ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him. \nAmy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch. \nSimon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy. \nSimon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the rusted fence and gasps for breath. Warren waves the flaming torch in his face. \nSIMON (weakly, unheard) One of you is gunna lose an eye. \nAmy comes nearer with a can of gasoline. Simon pulls himself to his feet as she splashes him with fuel. Warren is waving the torch deliriously above his head. \nSIMON (screaming) One of you is gunna lose an eye! \nWarren stops. \nAmy steps back and lowers the gas can. \nSimon turns with effort to face them, adjusts his glasses and continues... \nSIMON One of you. I promise. \nWarren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which is too hot to handle. He drops it. \nAmy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused. \nSimon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his hands and stares straight at Warren. \nSIMON You can set me on fire. But one of you is gunna have an eye torn out of your head. I promise. \nWarren is transfixed. He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps back, scared, and puts down the gas can. She turns and walks away. \nWarren looks back at Simon, troubled. \nHe hangs there still, glaring at him. \nFurther away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands. Amy looks ill. \nWARREN Fuck. \nAMY Take me home. \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nHenry is at one of the tables, correcting the spelling in Simon's notebook, when he looks up and sees... \nSimon stumble in, beaten and bruised, dropping his classics to the floor. Henry and Mr Deng rush over to him. \nHENRY (scared) Simon! Who did this to you? \nSIMON I was gunna tear out their eyes. I knew I could do it. \nHENRY Whose eyes? \nSIMON I told them. Like you said. I told them. And I knew I could do it. \nHe passes out. Henry looks at Mr Deng. \nMR DENG You should take him home. He smells like a toilet. \nHenry nods, agreeing, then lifts Simon off the floor. Mr Deng holds the door open as Henry carries his friend out into the parking lot. \nMeanwhile, Gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor and places them beside Simon's notebook, where it still sits open on the table. She looks at it, then reads. She lifts it off the table and reads further, immediately and deeply engrossed. \nMr Deng watches as Henry departs with Simon, then comes back into the store and stops, startled, when he sees... \nGnoc sitting there, staring off into space, the notebook open in her hands before her, singing quietly. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nTwenty minutes later. \nFay is in the bathroom helping Simon out of his clothes, trying to clean his wounds. \nFAY (calling) Shit, Mom, we gotta get him to a hospital! \nSIMON No! \nFAY Oh, shut up! Turn around. \nHenry is at the kitchen table with Mary. She watches him suspiciously. He lets her. \nMARY This kinda thing has happened before. \nHENRY (standing) It won't happen again. \nShe watches him as he walks around the room, browsing. \nMARY How do you know? \nHENRY Don't move! Fuck. There. \nSIMON Are you sure that's right? \nHENRY Yes. Now shut up and lie back. \nSimon does. \nSIMON Is this gunna hurt? \nHENRY Yes. \nHe pauses, then leans back. \nHENRY You gunna be alright? \nSimon nods and stares at the ceiling. Henry hands him a towel. \nHENRY Here. Bite on this. \nSIMON (spots blood on it) What's that? \nHENRY (looking) It's blood. From your head. Lie back. Shove that in your mouth and hold on to something. \nSimon bites down on the towel and grips the edge of the bed with his free hand. Henry sits on his legs and gently raises the broken arm. \nOutside the door, Fay bites her knuckles. Further down the hall, Mary listens from her bedroom. \nHENRY Okay. You ready? \nSimon nods. Henry grabs hold of the arm, swallows and braces himself. Simon waits, then Henry tugs the arm straight. \nSIMON Aaagghhh!!!!!!! \nFay turns and runs down the stairs. Mary backs away into her room and shuts the door. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nLater that night. \nHenry comes downstairs and stops, tired. Fay is sitting at the table with a bottle of gin and two glasses. She has dolled herself up a little and Henry likes what he sees. He looks her over and she smiles. He sits. She pours. They drink. \nFAY So, do you have, like, you know, a girlfriend, Henry? \nHENRY No. \nThey drink again in silence. He lights her cigarette and they watch each other closely. Finally, Fay leans on the table and twirls a strand of her hair between her fingers. \nFAY Do you find me attractive? \nHENRY Yes, I do. \nFAY I look young for my age, don't I? \nHENRY How old are you? \nFAY How old do you think I am? \nHENRY You look young. \nFAY (playfully) How young? \nHENRY I don't know. Young. \nFAY But how... I mean, do I look more like twenty, or... you know, thirty? \nHe drinks and studies her. She presents her profile. Finally, he leans back. \nHENRY Thirty. \nFay jumps up, furious. \nFAY Listen, you geek, after a couple of drinks plenty of people mistake me for eighteen! \nShe grabs her bag and storms out of the house. Henry watches her go, then chuckles deviously and splashes himself another drink. \nEXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nNext morning. \nA thirty-year-old cocktail waitress named Vicky walks up and stops when she sees... \nWarren, sitting back against the side of World of Donuts, smoking a joint and thinking about his future. \nShe sighs and approaches. \nVICKY Hey, Warren, are you a registered voter? \nWARREN Bug off, Vicky! \nUnruffled, she hands him a flyer. \nWARREN (reading) 'Saving America From Itself.' What the fuck is this? \nVICKY It's everything you need to know about the upcoming elections and congressman Owen Feer and all the really good things he wants to do for our country. \nHe tokes deeply, then... \nWARREN Oh yeah, like what? \nVICKY He wants to win back this country for us Americans, Warren, and restore some kind of cultural-moral standard to our way of life. \nWarren looks over the flyer, then reconsiders Vicky. \nWARREN What time's your kid go off to school? \nThey fall away from each other in terror and fatigue. Mary clutches wildly at her bathrobe as Henry falls over the coffee table, stumbles to his feet and pulls up his trousers. \nFay is crushed. She breaks out in tears and runs upstairs. \nHenry catches his breath and starts after her, but stops, uncertain and confused. \nMARY You bastard! \nHENRY What? \nMARY Get out! \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nSimon is asleep with his head down on the table. He wakes finally and sees... \nHenry sitting across from him, gripping a beer and reading the poem. He finishes, shuts the book and drinks. \nHENRY Listen. I know a man. He's a big shot in the publishing business. Angus James. Smart, adventurous and tons of integrity. When this thing is ready, I'll recommend he reads it. He'll respect my opinion. \nSimon takes this in, then looks down at his hands and proceeds carefully. \nSIMON A man was here today looking for you. \nHENRY (alert) What man? \nSIMON I don't know. He drove by the house a few times. \nHenry throws his eyes heavenward and pulls his hair. Jumping to his feet, he paces maniacally. \nHENRY Why do they torment me like this? Why? They're like a bunch of fucking mosquitoes! \nA customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves. \nSIMON What do they want from you? \nHENRY They want to suffocate me, Simon! They wanna extinguish me like a flame! \nSome kid named Tim, sitting at another table, turns around and asks... \nTIM But why? \nHENRY They're afraid, that's why! They're afraid of what I might do! What I might say! Think! They're afraid of my ideas! \nHe drinks, then returns and sits beside Simon. \nHENRY You and I are alike in this way, Simon. \nSIMON Yeah? \nHENRY We're outsiders. We think and feel too much and too deeply. And the world can't handle that. Our mere existence is a threat to its illusion of security. Sure, they'll name a wing of a new library after us when we're dead! But now... Now, when we're alive... Now, they wanna burn us at the stake! \nHe drinks, burps, then slams down the can. He glances over at Tim who is still looking on. \nHENRY Scram. \nTim hesitates, but then obeys. He gets up and leaves. Henry returns to Simon. \nHENRY For example, I made love to your mother about half an hour ago and now I'm beginning to think that maybe it wasn't such a good idea. \nSimon blinks. Henry adds... \nHENRY I mean to say, I think Fay may be jealous. \nSimon is deeply confused. He looks ill. He stands and takes a few steps away, staring at the floor. \nSIMON I don't want to think about this. \nHENRY Bad move, Simon. \nSimon stops and looks at him. \nHENRY (pointing at him) A poet has got to be able to think about anything. \nSimon pauses, then comes closer to Henry and stops. \nSIMON Am I really a poet? \nHenry jumps up, strides around the store and speaks at the top of his voice. \nHENRY Of course you are! A great poet! But you need experience. You need to do something to be ashamed of every once in a while, for cryin' out loud. \nHe walks to the door. \nHENRY Come on! Let's go out! There's a den of iniquity right across the street! You got any money? \nHe strides out of the store. \nSimon stands there, stunned and looks at Mr Deng as the old man wipes off the table with a wet rag. \nINT. THE INFERNO -- NIGHT \nLater that night. \nHenry is dancing wildly on the bar with two sloppy-drunk topless dancers. The place is rocking and the crowd cheers them on. \nSimon sits perched on a stool, gripping the bar with white knuckles and clutching a beer, looking on in terror as... \nHenry starts stripping. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT \nLater that night. \nSimon stumbles in and heads upstairs. But he stops, seeing... \nHENRY Shit. Come on, this way. \nAnd he runs down the street in the opposite direction. Simon hangs back, but then follows... \nINT. CHURCH -- DAY \nMoments later. \nThey scramble in and Henry is out of breath. He slumps down into a pew. \nHENRY Keep a look out. Tell me when he's gone. \nSimon does, but then... \nSIMON Henry, what's going on? Who is that guy? What's he want? \nHENRY He wants to help me! He wants to be my friend. \nHe pats his pockets, looking for his smokes. Simon looks on, baffled. He comes closer. \nSIMON Help you with what? \nHENRY (suddenly) Shhh! \nHe hears something, stands and moves further into the church. Simon hesitates, but then follows. They hear someone crying. Finally, in a pew off to one side in the shadows, they find... \nA young priest named Father Hawkes. He's a wreck. He looks up from his quiet sobbing and sees... \nHenry and Simon standing there looking on with embarrassed distaste. He lowers his head in shame. Henry moves closer and sits beside the distraught priest. \nHENRY What's wrong? \nThe priest sighs hopelessly. \nFATHER HAWKES I doubt. \nHenry leans back with a sigh and reaches for his cigarettes. \nHENRY So, you're an honest man. Why beat yourself up about it? \nHe offers a cigarette to the priest and he accepts. \nFATHER HAWKES I don't know if there are grounds for faith. Is my vocation relevant? Does it make a difference? \nSIMON A difference in what? \nFATHER HAWKES The world. The way it is. Is this a way to help relieve suffering? \nHENRY Your vocation makes a difference. \nFATHER HAWKES How can you be so sure? \nHENRY Because vocation is the difference. Only someone who really cares doubts. Listen, father, as I was about to tell my friend Simon here, I am, without doubt, the biggest sinner within a hundred miles of this parish. But still, I've gotta stay up late at night to outdo the unending parade of mundane little atrocities I see committed every day right out in the open spaces of this loud and sunlit culture we call home. \nFATHER HAWKES You seem to me to be a sensitive and generous man. \nHENRY I like to think so. But the fact is I appreciate depravity. Nevertheless, I insist your vocation makes a difference, because to hold out anything other than a spiritual yardstick to reality is to be jerking off grandly into the abyss. Listen, have you got any money? Let's go have a drink. \nEXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nWarren is stopping people on their way in and out of World of Donuts. \nWARREN Excuse me, miss, are you a registered voter? \nMISS Oh God, really I don't know. \nWARREN Well, I'd like to give you some information about Congressman Owen Feer. This man is gunna make a big difference in the lives of every American in the years to come... \nMISS Thanks, sure. I gotta go, thanks. \nA man, Bill, steps up... \nWARREN Pardon me, sir... \nBILL Fuck off! \nWARREN Right. \nWarren stands back and loosens his tie. He looks over at Pearl age seven, who is sitting outside the store. \nWARREN What time's your mother get off work? \nShe doesn't respond. He shakes his head and approaches. He sees Fay exit the store... \nWARREN Fay, are you a registered voter? \nFAY (stopping) Don't you dare talk that way to me! And keep your hands off my brother. Pearl, what are you doing here? \nWARREN I'm watchin' her. \nFay figures it out and approaches. \nFAY You and Vicky get back together? \nWARREN I gotta regular job now and everything. \nShe lifts a flyer and reads. \nFAY I saw this retard on TV this morning. \nWARREN He's gunna be the next president of the United States of America, Fay. \nFAY Keep dreamin' Warren. The guy's a Nazi. \nWARREN I like him! \nBU\u00d1UEL I tried, Henry. I really did. \nHENRY So what happened? \nBU\u00d1UEL Henry, with your background... Well, I mean, with your record, they didn't think it'd be right to have you at the neighborhood library. \nHENRY Why not? \nBU\u00d1UEL They thought you'd be a bad influence on the kids. \nHenry sits back, offended. \nBU\u00d1UEL (adds) Or worse. \nHENRY So my word is not enough. My promise worthless. The fact I've served my time nothing but the emblem of my continuing guilt. \nBU\u00d1UEL Apparently. \nHenry leans back and sighs, furious and indignant. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT \nSimon comes in, excited and preoccupied, and finds Fay working at the computer. \nFAY What's up? \nSIMON (guiltily) Nothing. \nFAY I'm creating my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. This computer's got a program especially for it. I bought some special stationery too. It's scented. Look. \nShe shoves a sheath of papers up under his nose and he backs away in disgust. \nFAY It's roses. \nSimon takes his notebooks from a cabinet above the fridge. \nSIMON Can you type my poem into that thing? \nFAY (shocked) That's your poem? \nSIMON Yeah. \nFAY (smokes, then) Simon, Mom's right about you. A poem's supposed to be a small, delicate kinda thing. Kinda feminine. Gentle. Look at this. You've made a fuckin' telephone book. \nHe places the notebooks on the table and leaves the house. Fay clears the computer screen, pulls the notebooks closer and gets down to work. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nMoments later. \nSimon arrives with a six-pack and finds Henry sitting in front of the fire, staring into the flames, brooding darkly. \nHENRY I was caught. Yes, I was caught... once. I was caught in flagranti delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old girl named Susan. She was an ugly and mean-spirited kid, but she knew how to play upon my weaknesses which, I admit, are deep and many. \nHe drinks, then looks at Simon and adds... \nHENRY You appear shocked. \nSIMON (he is) Sorry. \nHenry stands and leans over the fire. \nHENRY It was a pathetic little conspiracy. A transparently desperate attempt to discredit me and my ideas; to label me a mere pedophile. As if I'd be ashamed of such a thing. As if Socrates himself hadn't been taken out of circulation for corrupting the youth of Athens! \nHe comes over and takes a beer. He strides around the room, thinking, reflecting. \nHENRY Seven years. Seven years for one afternoon of blissful transgression. But what of it? Who cares? Prison's not so bad; particularly if one's a sex offender, free from the popular and conventional horror of sodomy. \nStops, drinks declares... \nHENRY They were not 'lost years'. \nHe approaches the notebooks lined up on the mantelpiece. \nHENRY I put them to good use. I began my major work. My opus. \nHe glances over at Simon, who sits gripping his beer, watching, rapt. \nHENRY Believe me, Simon, this incident with the girl, prison... It pales to insignificance in the wider context of my career. \nHe pauses and swills back some beer. He brightens up, gets excited... \nHENRY Nothing in comparison to the day my 'Confession' is unleashed. (beginning to pace) What an orgy we'll have then, huh? What shouts of outrage from the offended populace, from the sanctimonious purveyors of culture and quality, the righteous defenders of what ever inane and haphazard notion of progress then in vogue. They'll be beside themselves with fiercely reasoned critical analysis. Apoplectic with indignation! \nDrinks sloppily, burps, wipes his mouth with his arm. \nHENRY Their feelings will be hurt. \nHe smashes the bottle in the fireplace. \nHENRY Yes, like a mirror which reflects only the inside of the person before it, my 'Confession' will lovingly render humanity's common monstrosity in all of its lurid wide screen glory. \nHe grabs a new beer and twists off its cap. \nHENRY Why should I blush or feel shame before the common lot of humanity, anyway, for a few banal and, again I admit, inelegant transgressions? \nHe drinks, sighs and sits back down. \nHENRY After all, really, I'm doing civilization a favor. \nSimon sits back in awe. He waits a moment and thinks. Finally he stands and approaches the 'Confession'. He reaches out and drags his hand across the notebooks. \nSIMON When can I read it? \nHenry sits staring into the flames again. He pauses, then... \nFay and Amy talk tech as... \nHENRY (continues) The thing to do is to send parts of it to different magazines and literary journals first. That kinda thing. You know. Substantiate it. \nAMY (looking up) What's 'scatalogical' mean? \nHenry sips his beer and looks at her. \nHENRY Filth, child. A preoccupation with excrement. Why? \nAMY That's what the Board of Education called Simon's poem, yesterday; scatological. \nHenry reaches across the table and shakes Simon's hand. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY \nThe next day. \nFay is frying something on the stove, a cigarette hangs from her lip. A middle-aged woman with a press ID on her lapel appears at the kitchen door and taps. \nEDNA Hello? \nFAY Yeah, I'm listening. \nEDNA My name is Edna Rodriguez and I write the human interest column for the Queens County Examiner and I was just wondering if I could have a word with Simon Grim? \nIntrigued, Fay steps over to the door with her spatula. She looks Edna over, studies her ID, then steps away and screams upstairs. \nFAY Simon! \nEDNA (startled) Thank you. \nFay comes back over near the door, waving her spatula. \nFAY You can't talk to him for, you know, too long or anything, 'cause he's gotta, you know... he writes all day. That's all he does. Can you believe that? \nNo response. \nFAY (calling again) Hey! Simon! Get down here! \nSimon finally shuffles into the kitchen. \nFAY Simon, this is Edna. She's from the newspaper. \nEDNA (rapid fire) Simon, the Parents' Association at the local high school are calling your poem pornography. The teachers are defending the students' right to exercise their critical tastes and sensibilities. The county agrees with the Church and considers the poem emblematic of modern society's moral disintegration. How do you feel about these controversial reactions to your poem? \nSimon says nothing. He just stares at her. \nFAY (punching him) Simon, answer the woman. \nSimon just looks away, thinks, then wanders back upstairs. Mary passes him on his way out of the kitchen and comes up to Fay and Edna at the door. \nMARY I need my prescription filled. \nFAY Mom, this is Edna. Edna, Mom. \nEDNA Mrs Grim, what was Simon like as a child? \nMARY We all thought he was retarded. \nFAY Everyone did. \nMARY Never said a word. \nFAY He masturbated constantly. \nMARY Had no friends. \nFAY Till he met Henry. \nMARY And that's when all the trouble really started. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nHenry is shaving. Simon sits in the kitchen, sorting through rejection letters... \nSIMON (reading) Dear Mr Grim, we here at the magazine consider ourselves and the publication open-minded and cutting edge and have consistently printed the work of the most brilliant and farseeing young talent of the day. Every week we are forced to return writing which we can not for one reason or another publish and include a brief but polite refusal. But this tract you've sent us demands a response as violent as the effect your words have had upon us. Drop dead. Keep your day job. Sincerely, The Editors. \nHENRY De gustibus non disputandum est. \nSIMON (thinking) You can't argue with taste? \nHENRY About taste. You can't argue about taste. God, Simon. \nSimon gives up and pushes the letters away, beaten. \nSIMON The other twenty-five are almost as bad. I don't know why I bother. \nHenry drops his razor and stomps out into the hall. \nHENRY What do you mean you don't know why you bother? You bother because you know the poem is excellent! \nSIMON Do I? \nHENRY Of course you do! \nSIMON I'm not so sure sometimes. \nHENRY Can you sit there, look me straight in the eye, and tell me you don't think this poem is great? That it is not at once a work of great lyrical beauty and ethical depth? That it is not a genuine, highly individual, and profound meditation on the miracle of existence? \nSimon holds the stare, overwhelmed. \nSIMON I, ah... \nHENRY Can you? \nSIMON That was nice what you were playing. \nMARY Yes, it was nice. But it was unremarkable. \nSimon waits. Eventually... \nSIMON Does that matter? \nMARY (looking right at him) Yes. It does. \nShe gets up off the couch and goes upstairs. She slams her bedroom door and leaves Simon alone on the couch. He thinks. Then, he gets up and goes into the kitchen. \nHe takes the typed manuscript of his poem from the cabinet above the refrigerator and goes to the door. He pauses, clutches the poem and goes out. \nEXT. SUBWAY STATION -- DAY \nSimon waits, clutching his poem to his side, as a train pulls into the station. Excited and determined, he gets on. \nINT. TRAIN -- DAY \nSimon travels to New York City. He finds an envelope on the floor to put the poem in. \nINT. MARY'S ROOM -- DAY \nMary wakes up and sits on the edge of the bed, feeling regretful about her tone of voice with Simon. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY \nMoments later. \nMary comes down into the kitchen and listens. \nMARY Simon? \nNo answer. She steps over to the cabinet and almost takes down Simon's notebook. But doesn't. She grabs her pills and is about to take them. But then she stops. She puts them down and goes to the cabinet. She takes down Simon's notebooks and sits at the table, pauses, then pulls them closer and begins to read. \nINT. PUBLISHING HOUSE LOBBY -- DAY \nSimon enters a big, posh lobby and checks the registry. \nINT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION -- DAY \nMoments later. \nSimon comes out of the elevator and enters the reception area of James Midriff and Sutton Publishing. He walks hesitantly up to the receptionist, a bright and spirited young woman named Laura. \nLAURA Hi, I'll take that. \nSimon steps back defensively. \nLAURA Aren't you the messenger? \nSIMON No. \nLAURA Are you here to fix the plumbing? \nSIMON I'm here to see Mr. Angus James. \nLAURA (amused) Are you? \nSIMON I'm not a plumber. Or a messenger. I was once a garbage man. But now I'm a poet. \nLaura steps back, cocks her head and removes her designer eye-wear. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY \nSame time. \nAngus is at a big table with two other men, Steve and Barry. \nBARRY The book, as we know it, Angus, will be a thing of the past within the next few years. Novels, articles, newspapers will all be downloaded on to our personal computers anyway. \nANGUS So you're telling me to get out of the publishing business? \nSTEVE No. But we've got to re-invent the publishing business for the electronic age. \nLaura knocks. \nANGUS Yes, Laura? \nLAURA I'm sorry to disturb you, gentlemen, but... Angus, there's a particularly wound-up young garbage man out here who seems to have written a poem. A long poem. And I recall how, at last month's meeting, you stressed the need for us to be on the look-out for more marginalized verse from unestablished quarters of the American scene. \nANGUS Did I say that? \nSteve and Barry nod. \nSTEVE Yeah. You did. \nBARRY Twice. \nANGUS Well, OK. Make an appointment, Laura. Sometime next month. \nLAURA Right-e-o. \nAnd she's gone. \nANGUS (returning) So, anyway, how is the digital revolution going to help me sell books? \nINT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION -- DAY \nSimon looks disappointed. \nSIMON Why can't I see him now? \nLAURA (sincerely) Because he's a very important man and, well, you're not. \nHENRY What? \nAMY Ontologically. \nHENRY O-N-T... Don't you have some kinda spell-check on that thing? \nAMY Never mind. \nHENRY It is impossible for every perfect good to be compatible with every other perfect good. The intense beauty of the mountain must be set off by the fertility of the plain, so to speak. \nHe smokes, drinks, paces some more. Amy waits with bated breath, devastated by his obscure profundity. He comes back and sits beside her, reaching his conclusion. \nHENRY The good of freewill must entail real choices for sin. \nShe gazes at his profile, in love. \nHenry sits thinking and Amy watches him reverently. She leans over close and whispers in his ear. He turns and looks at her, alarmed. \nHENRY Listen, Amy, back off. I'm on parole. \nAMY You feel the same way. I can tell. I can see it when you look at me. \nHenry jumps up and looks around, paranoid. He keeps his voice down and points at her. \nHENRY Hey! I don't look at you. \nAMY Yes you do. In the street. In the parking lot yesterday. That night on the highway. \nHENRY I look at a lot of people that way. \nDisappointed, Amy turns away and sulks. \nAMY You think I'm stupid. \nHenry sees she's genuinely upset and feels bad. He sits back down and lays his hand on hers. \nHENRY No, as a matter of fact, I think you're a real bright kid and I like that about you. \nAMY (looks up, pouts) You do? \nNow Henry tries to scare her away. He leers at her. \nHENRY I like it so much I've got half a mind to do perverse things to you. Right here. Right now. Things you might just learn to like. \nShe just stares at him, blinks, then looks away and tries to imagine this. She takes her laptop and leaves, confused and blushing. \nHenry watches her go and grins, satisfied with himself. \nINT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION -- DAY \nAngus throws on his coat and thrusts the poem at Simon as they walk down the hall. \nANGUS This is really quite unbelievably bad, my friend. I mean, I'm all for experimentation and I've made a career out of a healthy disregard for convention, but... Look, this is profoundly irrelevant material. This is only my opinion. But it's an opinion I value highly. Goodnight, Laura. Call Norton Press. We're still on for tomorrow. \nSimon looks pale as Angus strides towards the elevator. \nANGUS I've been wrong before as a publisher. But I refuse to admit I've ever been wrong as a reader. You have talent, I admit. You have an innate sense of the musicality of language. A good ear, maybe. But you do nothing significant with it. And this twisted reasoning that poses as... conviction or insight, it's... well, it's embarrassing. \nThey reach the elevator and stop. Simon tries to catch his breath. \nANGUS Why did you bring this thing to me, anyway? \nSIMON (weakly) A friend of mine spoke of you. He said you had a lot of integrity. \nANGUS Yes, well, of course, I do. But I'm not crazy, am I? Who is this person? Do I know him? \nSimon hesitates, almost decides against it, but then... \nSIMON Henry Fool. \nAngus looks back at him. \nSimon waits. \nAngus looks aside, thinks, then shakes his head. \nANGUS Never heard of him. \nSimon just looks at him blankly, confused. \nThe doors slide open and Angus gets in the elevator. He's gone. Simon sinks into a chair and stares at the carpet. He is so surprised and hurt he gasps for breath. \nHis poem slips from his hand and falls to the floor. \nLAURA (off) I remember Henry. \nSimon doesn't register this right away. But then he looks up and over at the receptionist. \nLaura stands and comes around her desk. She pauses, seeing his disappointment, then comes closer and picks up his poem. Handing it to him, she explains... \nLAURA He used to be the janitor here. \nHe just stares at her, demolished. \nEXT. SIDEWALK/SUBWAY ENTRANCE -- DAY \nLater. \nSimon dumps his poem in a trash can, pauses, then enters the subway. \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nHenry is leaning on the counter, flipping through pornographic magazines and smoking. \nMR DENG (off) Henry, put those magazines back. \nSame time. \nSimon comes in, furious and throws open the fridge. He finds nothing to eat or drink. He slams the door, then hears the water running in the bathroom upstairs. He stops and listens. \nThe bathroom door; the water heard running steadily. \nSimon turns away then sees... \nThe poem notebooks face down on the table. \nHe thinks. \nThe bathroom door; the water heard running... \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nMoments later. \nHenry comes into his house, hot and bothered, cradling his six-pack. But he stops, listens, then steps through the kitchen towards the living-room. He stops in the entrance and sees... \nFay on the floor of the living-room, reading his 'Confession', her mouth hung open in an astonished 'O'. \nHe drops his six-pack and... \nShe spins around, caught in the act. \nHenry stands in the doorway, pent up, sweating and with perverse things on his mind. \nFay, her hands palm down on the floor behind her, bites her lip, coquettishly. \nHenry looks her over like she was something good to eat. \nShe feels his gaze all over her and twists to one side with a breathless little shudder. \nHe steps nearer, stands over her and she looks up at him. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nSame time. \nSimon climbs the stairs to the bathroom... \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nSame time. \nHenry and Fay kissing passionately... \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nSame time. \nSimon knocks on the bathroom door. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nSame time. \nHenry and Fay groping and shoving one another as they stagger from room to room. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nSame time. \nSimon bangs on the bathroom door. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nSame time. \nFay falls to the couch... \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nSame time. \nSimon crashes through the door and finds... \nMary, kneeling over the edge of the tub, her wrists slit and the blood running down the drain, the shower raining down over her back. \nSimon looks on in horror. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nSame time. \nHenry tears open his trousers... \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nSame time. \nSimon lifts Mary from the bathtub. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nSame time. \nHenry and Fay clutch and grind and heave... \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nSame time. \nSimon drags his mother from the bathroom and down the stairs. \nHENRY What happened to you? \nVICKY He's a good man, Henry. Nobody's perfect. \nHENRY I guess not. \nVICKY He's terribly disappointed. \nHENRY I found Pearl wandering around with no shoes on her feet. \nPearl comes over and stands beside her mother. \nVICKY Thanks. She gets scared. \nHENRY And you don't? \nVicky caresses Pearl's hair, then drinks and looks over at Henry. \nVICKY I love him. \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nMoments later. \nBu\u00f1uel is waiting when Henry walks in and steps up to the beer cooler. \nHENRY (alarmed) Where's the beer? \nMR DENG No more beer. Coffee. Espresso! Cappuccino! Caf\u00e9 au lait. Carrot juice. Herbal tea. \nHenry looks at the man, disgusted, then falls in to a seat and motions to Gnoc, who is now the waitress. \nHENRY A double espresso and a jelly donut, Gnoc. (to Bu\u00f1uel) You mind paying? My credit's no good here anymore, apparently. \nBU\u00d1UEL (nods amiably) Did you go to the employment agency today, Henry? \nHENRY No, but it's OK. Simon's gunna try to get me a job on the garbage truck. \nBU\u00d1UEL Listen, I'm a little concerned about your friend. \nHENRY Simon? \nBU\u00d1UEL Seems he gave an obscene note to a girl in the library. \nHENRY Get outta here! When? \nBU\u00d1UEL I'm not sure. \nHENRY It couldn't have been Simon. \nBU\u00d1UEL It almost certainly is. He mentions you. Look... \nHe unfolds a print-out of the letter. Henry reads and Bu\u00f1uel leans over, pointing out... \nHENRY 'Her figure makes me violent. I want to somehow break her. But tenderly. How is this possible? Ask Henry.' \nHenry thinks this over, gulps back some espresso and nods his approval. Then... \nHENRY Bu\u00f1uel, this is obviously a love letter. \nBU\u00d1UEL (taking it back) We've had complaints. \nHENRY Where did you get it? \nBU\u00d1UEL She posted it on the Internet. \nHENRY Oh, the slut! \nBU\u00d1UEL She was trying to warn other girls about a potential rapist. \nHENRY (smokes) Is all this true about the Internet? About how you can get pornography on it? \nBU\u00d1UEL Well, yeah, sure. It's a big problem. You can send dirty pictures and everything. \nHENRY On the Internet? \nBU\u00d1UEL Yeah. \nHenry is impressed. \nHENRY No kiddin'? \nBu\u00f1uel gets up to go. \nBU\u00d1UEL See you on Thursday, Henry. \nHENRY (thinking) Sure. See you. (calls the waitress) Gnoc, gimme one of these double espressos to go, will ya? \nHe is having ideas. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY \nMoments later. \nFay, still dressed in black, is tapping away on the keys to the computer, surfing the Internet, as Henry appears at the kitchen door, gripping his tall double espresso. \nHENRY Hello, Fay. \nFAY Go away. \nHENRY You gotta get outta the house, Fay. You can't blame yourself for not being here. You did all you could for her. \nShe turns and glares at him. \nFAY Is there something you want? \nFAY He thinks I'm a slut. \nAnd she starts crying again. Simon awkwardly touches her shoulder, then moves his hand away. Fay pulls herself together, sniffles and goes into the bathroom. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE, AT THE PIANO \nMoments later. \nSimon comes downstairs and finds Henry at the piano. He looks ill and is clutching a nearly empty container of espresso. He is staring sickly at 'the ring'. \nSIMON Henry? \nHENRY Simon, I don't feel so good. \nSIMON What's wrong? \nHENRY I feel all kinda clammy. And damp. \nSimon lifts the coffee container and smells it. \nSIMON How many of these did you have? \nHenry tries to remember. He squints. \nHENRY Seven. \nSimon puts the container down and sits at the table. \nSIMON Henry, we have to talk. \nHENRY Can I use your toilet? \nSIMON Fay's taking a shower. \nHenry grabs his stomach. He presses his hand against his chest, holds his head, then stares at the ring. \nHENRY How much you think I can get for this? \nHe looks at Simon. \nSIMON (pauses) Henry, Fay's pregnant. \nHenry looks at him. \nSIMON Fay's pregnant with your child. \nHenry lets this sink in. He stands and the room tilts. White with fear, he clutches at his rumbling gut. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM \nMoments later. \nFay is in the shower as... \nHenry bursts into the bathroom, tearing at his belt and trousers. She starts screaming and wraps herself in the shower curtain. He drops his pants and throws himself on the toilet just in time to begin shitting his brains out. Fay crouches, terrified and disgusted, in the shower. \nFAY Jesus, Henry! \nHenry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent and messy blast of noise and foul air. \nFay covers her face and whimpers sickly. \nFinally, he's done. He hangs with his face out over his knees, sick, exhausted and in shock. Fay wraps herself in a towel and steps out of the shower. She creeps carefully around him and flushes the toilet, growing increasingly concerned. \nFAY Hey, Henry. You OK? \nHe is destroyed, staring down at... \nThe 'ring' he still holds in his hand. \nFay sees this, looks at Henry, then kneels and takes it from him. He doesn't resist. She lifts it up and breathlessly admires it. Totally misunderstanding, moved beyond words... \nFAY Oh. Oh, Henry. \nAnd she throws her arms around him as he sits there, sweating and spent, on the toilet. \nINT. CHURCH -- DAY \nA month later. \nMr Deng and Bu\u00f1uel drag Henry, kicking and screaming, into the church foyer. Once inside, he shakes them off and they stand back. He huffs and puffs and tosses the hair back out of his eyes. He paces back and forth like a caged animal, then stops, sees... \nFay, at the altar, waiting with Simon. She is beautiful. \nHenry calms down, deeply affected. \nFay smiles down the aisle at him. \nHenry throws back his shoulders, straightens his tie and strides up the aisle. \nAlso present at the ceremony are Vicky and Warren. Gnoc is maid of honor. \nINT. CHURCH -- DAY \nLater. \nHenry holds Fay's hand and repeats after Father Hawkes. \nFATHER HAWKES I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my wife. \nHENRY I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my wife. \nFATHER HAWKES And do promise before God and these witnesses... \nHENRY And do promise before God and these witnesses... \nANGUS Because I think your writing will be tremendously successful. \nSIMON But you don't like it? \nANGUS It's growing on me. \nSIMON What made you change your mind? \nHe points to the fans outside. \nANGUS Other people's responses. I don't live in a vacuum, you know. Two months ago I didn't have the proof of your poem's appeal. Now I do. \nSimon thinks this over, but says nothing. Angus comes over and lays his hand on his shoulder. \nANGUS Consider my offer carefully. Get some professional advice. I'll call you tomorrow. \nSimon nods. \nEXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nMoments later. \nAngus emerges and has to fight his way through the throng of excited adolescents. He reaches his limo and gets in. But he pauses before closing the door and considers the crowd. \nSimon emerges from the store and kids begin screaming and shouting for autographs. Angus shakes his head, impressed. \nINT. CHURCH -- DAY \nSimon consults Father Hawkes. \nFATHER HAWKES What were the terms? \nSIMON A hundred thousand in cash up front. \nFATHER HAWKES Royalties? \nSIMON A seventy/thirty split. \nFATHER HAWKES Well, that could be better. But it is a hundred thousand dollars up front. Guaranteed money. You could use that. \nSIMON So it's a good deal? \nFATHER HAWKES Of course it's good. \nSIMON So I should take it? \nFATHER HAWKES No. Try to get him up to a hundred and fifty thousand. \nEXT. JUNKYARD -- DAY \nEvening. \nHenry stalks along, all fired up. Simon tries his best to keep up with him. \nHENRY I've let myself down, Simon! I've let myself be caught in the bloody maw of banal necessity! How did I get here? How did this happen to me? I'm going to be somebody's father! I need time to think. To write. Time to finish my 'Confession'! I can't work for a living! It's impossible! I tried once. My genius will be wasted trying to make ends meet! \nHe collapses extravagantly. \nHENRY This is how great men topple, Simon. Their hearts are in the right place too much of the time! They get sidetracked! Distracted. Oh! How could I have been so careless! \nSIMON Henry, please, let me read the 'Confession'. \nHENRY No. Not now. It's not done. I'm all washed up. I'm finished! \nSIMON Angus James is convinced my poem is going to make him incredibly wealthy. He'll read your book and seriously consider publishing it. If I ask him to. I'm certain. \nHenry glances back at his friend, digesting this. He thinks it over, then... \nHENRY Really? You really think so? \nHaving finally got through to him, Simon comes forward, anxious to help Henry. \nSIMON I'll insist he publish the 'Confession'. \nHe paces back and forth, thrusting out his chest, for the first time in his life displaying something like pride or arrogance. \nSIMON (adds) Or I won't let him publish my poem. \nHenry sits there watching Simon, impressed with this evidence of increased self-esteem. He realizes the profundity of the gesture. \nHENRY You'd do that? You'd do that for me? \nSimon stares off into the distance. \nSIMON You saved my life. \nHenry is moved. He stands and comes forward. He grabs his friend by the shoulders and turns him around. \nHENRY Do you realize what you're saying? \nSIMON (pausing) I owe you everything. \nHenry steps away, considering, then looks back at Simon and extends his hand. \nHENRY OK. \nSimon smiles. Henry smiles. They shake hands. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nSimon enters, comes forward into the room and pauses, looking off at... \nThe stack of twelve books that comprise the 'Confession'. \nEXT. HOUSE/BACKYARD -- DAY \nEXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nHenry and Gnoc load Fay into the van. The van pulls out. \nINT. VAN -- DAY \nHenry drives recklessly. Fay rolls around in the back. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- DAY \nFay is in a wheelchair being rushed down the hall. She is gripping Henry's hand as he runs along beside her. \nINT. HOSPITAL DELIVERY ROOM -- DAY \nFay gasps and sweats as the Doctor and Nurse prepare her. She is scared. She looks over at... \nHenry, looking in through the window. He looks scared too. \nFay is sedated by gas. \nHenry is taken away by the Nurse. \nFay stares up at the ceiling. \nINT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT \nHenry is asleep on a row of waiting-room chairs, exhausted. \nSimon comes running up the hall and finds him. It's late and no one is around. He sits down beside Henry and shakes him. \nHenry wakes. \nHENRY Simon? You're here. \nHe sits up and Simon sits beside him. \nSIMON What happened? \nHENRY (coughs) It's a boy. \nSIMON And Fay? \nHENRY She's alright. \nSimon sits back, relieved. Then he remembers the rain-soaked shopping bag he has with him. He pulls out a couple of cans of beer and hands one to Henry. \nHENRY Thanks. \nThey look around, seasoned conspirators and make sure the coast is clear. Then they pop open the beers and toast. \nThey drink. Then... \nHENRY How did it go? \nSimon pauses, scared, then gets up and crosses the room. He looks out of the window and gathers his strength. \nSIMON Listen, Henry, Angus James didn't like your 'Confession'. \nHenry looks at Simon blankly, then blinks and looks away. \nHENRY Ah. I see. Well, what now? \nSIMON What do you mean? \nHENRY Did he suggest changes? \nSilence. Simon comes back and sits again. \nSIMON No. He didn't. \nHENRY I mean, after all, there are things I can do to make it more accessible. \nSIMON Accessible? \nHENRY I can soften up some of the language and make it read easier. Take out some of the more intratextual references and popularize the underlying Sturm und Drang, so to speak. I can change its mode. Make it more of a conventional novel instead. \nSimon just stares at him blankly, then sighs and shakes his head. \nSIMON No. Don't. \nHENRY (laughing) Oh, Simon, don't be such a purist! I appreciate your protectiveness, but the integrity of the work gives it a durability that can sustain such things. \nSimon comes over and lays his hand on Henry's shoulder. \nSIMON No. Really, Henry. Don't. \nHENRY What are you saying; that it doesn't merit revision? \nSIMON I'm saying... Angus James didn't like it. \nHe steps away and sits. Henry pauses, then approaches and leans down over him. \nHENRY Well, did you tell him what you think? \nSIMON What I think doesn't matter. \nHENRY Yes, it does. You've got to use your influence with him. \nSIMON I gave it to him to read and he hated it. What more can I do? \nHENRY You can refuse to let him publish your poem. \nSIMON I can't do that. \nHENRY You said you would. \nAnd he offers the kid his whiskey. \nEXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nSame time. \nFay comes out of the house and looks for her son. \nFAY Ned! \nShe comes out to the street and looks around. \nFAY Ned! \nEXT. VICKY'S HOUSE -- DAY \nFay comes up looking for Ned and sees... \nPearl, age fourteen, come out of Vicky's House. She is fourteen years old now. Warren steps out the door and grabs her by the arm. She shakes him off. He slaps her. \nShe runs down the steps and glares back at him. \nWARREN (pointing at her) I'm warning you, Pearl! \nPearl turns defiantly away and walks into the street. \nINT. THE INFERNO -- DAY \nSame time. \nHenry is teaching Ned how to tip a topless dancer. A dancer stands on the bar and stretches her garter as Ned slips a dollar bill in beneath it. \nHENRY That's it. That's it. Perfect! \nSome other guy down the bar is reading a newspaper... \nBILL Hey, Fool, it's about your friend -- what's his name. Your brother-in- law. \nHenry looks over. The guy, Bill, shows him the article. \nHENRY What about him? \nBILL (reading) The controversial and reclusive American poet Simon Grim has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Swedish Academy, who will confer the award late next week, praised Mr Grim for works of great and difficult striving, for the rendering of the desperate, the ugly and the mundane in a language packed with our shared human frailties... \nHENRY God, they must be hard up for geniuses to pin medals on because, listen, I gotta tell you, when I first met this guy he didn't even know what an iambic pentameter was. \nBILL He's a fraud. \nHENRY Keep a lid on it, Bill, you're outta your league. \nBILL Stir things up so as to stay in the newspapers. That's his racket. \nHENRY He's a great American poet, you dumb fuck! \nBILL Poet, my ass! I could puke all over a piece a loose leaf and be more profound than he is! \nHENRY Come over here and say that and I'll cripple ya in three different ways, you boozed-up Philistine! \nFAY Henry! \nHenry and Ned crouch and quiver -- caught. Fay strides up to the bar and grabs the kid. \nFAY Listen, you degenerate, I've had about enough of this! (smells Ned's breath) Ned, have you been drinking? \nThe kid checks with Henry then looks back at Fay and nods. Fay looks at her husband, outraged. \nHENRY (explains) His throat hurt from smoking. \nFay slaps him across the face -- hard -- and the place goes quiet. Henry shakes his head clear and she pokes him in the chest with her finger. \nFAY Henry, don't come home tonight! I'm warning you! Don't come home at all! Ever! \nAnd she storms out with the kid. Henry snaps his jaw back into place, then looks at Patty and Bill and shrugs. He knocks back his drink and motions for another. \nEXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- NIGHT \nLater (evening). \nHenry staggers out of the back door of the Inferno and comes across Mr Deng sitting against the wall of the store, watching the basketball game on a small TV. World of Donuts vibrates with loud music. \nHENRY Who's winning? \nMR DENG Nobody. \nHenry gestures to World of Donuts... \nHENRY What's going on in there? \nMR DENG We gotta have rock 'n' roll shows these days, Henry. The poetry readings just don't pay the bills no more. \nHENRY What did I tell you! It was just a fad. I told you that! I told everyone! \nMR DENG Did you hear about Simon? It was on the news today. \nHENRY Yeah yeah yeah. So what? A Nobel Prize. Anybody can get one of them these days. That's the problem, with this world, Mr Deng... Nobody's got any standards anymore. You seen Fay? \nMR DENG You better sleep in my office tonight, Henry. She was very angry. You've gotta let her cool off. \nHENRY I can't sleep in there with that racket! \nMR DENG Suit yourself. \nHenry considers his options, then... \nINT. GARAGE -- NIGHT \nWARREN (off) Hey! \nHenry looks over and sees Warren stumble drunkenly out of the bathroom. What are you doing in my house? \nHENRY (to Vicky) It's about Pearl. \nVicky looks troubled. She sits back down with a sigh. \nVICKY Mind your own business, Henry. \nWARREN (shoves him) Yeah, who the hell do you think you are, anyway? \nHenry falls back and looks at Vicky. She looks away. \nHenry looks at Warren, pauses, then gives him a sharp, hard shove. \nWarren stands back against the wall, pauses, then erupts into viciousness. \nHe grabs Henry and throws him violently down the hall, where he hits the wall and collapses. \nAs Henry gets to his knees, Warren kicks him in the ribs. Henry curls up and rolls out on to the kitchen floor. Warren kicks him in the side of the head. \nVicky sits back down on the bed, covering her ears. \nWarren beats the hell out of Henry, kicking him in the face and ribs whenever he manages to get up on his hands and knees. Henry crawls under the kitchen table for safety. Warren grabs his feet and drags him out. As he is dragged across the floor, Henry finds a screwdriver and grabs it. He rolls over on his back as... \nWarren lunges down at him again and... \nWARREN Ah. \nWarren is stabbed in the heart. \nHenry can't believe it. \nWarren can't believe it. He stands there in the middle of the kitchen, amazed, with the screwdriver sticking out of his chest. \nHenry, semi-conscious and severely beaten, falls against the back door and coughs up a few of his teeth. Vicky steps into the hall from her room and shudders. \nWarren sits at the table, stunned. He looks from the screwdriver to Vicky, then... \nWARREN Fuck. \nHe falls to the floor. \nEXT. STREETS -- NIGHT \nHenry staggers away, limping. He comes to the intersection at the end of the block and doesn't know which way to run. Panicked, he looks round, holding his arm to his chest. He runs towards the highway. \nINT. POLICE STATION -- NIGHT \nLater. \nFay is wired beyond belief. Trying to listen attentively, but still too overwhelmed to maintain her concentration. \nLAWYER (off) It is true your husband served seven years in prison for statutory rape. \nFAY Yes. It is. \nLAWYER And when was that? \nFAY That was... I dunno. Fifteen... Sixteen years ago. \nLAWYER And when were you married? \nFAY We were married seven years ago. \nLAWYER Were you aware at all of the victim's relationship with his daughter? \nFAY Pardon me? \nLAWYER The girl, the daughter, Pearl. She had been having sexual relations with her father. \nFay is overwhelmed. \nFAY I didn't know that. No. \nLAWYER Pearl claims she offered your husband sexual favors if he would kill her father. \nFay just looks at him blankly, overwhelmed, confused. She starts to cry quietly. \nLAWYER I'm just repeating what she said, Mrs Fool. The victim's wife, Vicky, claims your husband broke into the house and forcefully entered her bedroom. \nFay trembles and catches her breath trying to take this all in. A cop hands her some tissues. She takes them and tries to concentrate on what the lawyer says. \nLAWYER Fay, I know this isn't easy. But we need your help here. The girl claims she asked your husband to kill her father in exchange for, well, I guess the promise of sexual relations with her. \nINT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR -- NIGHT \nLater. \nFay staggers out into the noisy corridor and rests against the wall. Looking down the hall she sees... \nPearl and Vicky, sitting in a blank, brightly lit room beyond a glass door. \nFay comes closer and looks in at them. \nThey don't see her. They stare at the floor before them, dazed and confused. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nMorning. \nFay is lying on her bed with her coat still on, trying to think. Ned stands by the side of the bed, watching her. \nNED Mom? \nNed runs up the stairs, the concierge in pursuit. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- DAY \nMoments later. \nNed jumps out into the hall, narrowly escaping the clutches of the concierge, who falls to the floor. \nNed runs up the hall, checking the room numbers as the concierge gets to his feet. He finds... \nRoom 423. \nHe knocks. \nThe concierge strides up the hall towards him. \nNed knocks again. \nThe concierge bears down upon him. \nHe knocks again and... \nThe door opens a crack, held by its safety chain. A female figure in silhouette is at the narrow gap. \nNed looks from the door to the concierge approaching. \nThe concierge arrives and reaches out for him, but the door opens wide and Ned dives in. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM 423 -- DAY \nSame time. \nThe concierge stands in the hallway. The door swings shut in his face. \nNed kneels on the floor of the hotel room, waiting to be smacked, or something. \nBut when nothing happens, he opens his eyes and looks back over his shoulder at... \nLaura, the secretary from the publishing house. She is dressed for travel and has her coat hung over her arm, a suitcase in her hand. She smiles at him, then looks from the boy to someone across the room and... \nNed follows her gaze to find... \nSimon, standing there before him, a suitcase in his hand as well. He looks down at Ned with a calm, intrigued expression. \nThe boy looks up at him in awe. \nSimon steps forward, pauses, then... \nSIMON Get up off your knees. \nHe does. \nEXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nA taxi pulls up. Simon and Ned climb out and Laura leans out of the window. \nLAURA Promise me you'll be on that plane at seven, Simon. \nSIMON I'll see you in Stockholm. \nThey kiss. The taxi pulls away. Simon comes down beside Ned, takes the boy by the shoulders and whispers in his ear. \nThe kid takes off. \nSimon looks over at World of Donuts and sees Gnoc waiting there at the door. \nEXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nGnoc leads Simon out through the kitchen. A band is seen doing a sound check, inside. \nBu\u00f1uel and Hawkes are waiting there, looking concerned. \nSimon gives Bu\u00f1uel his passport. \nBu\u00f1uel nods and leaves. \nHawkes and Gnoc open the cellar doors. \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS BASEMENT -- DAY \nMoments later. \nSimon is lead down the stairs and stops. He looks on in horror at... \nHenry, lying on a makeshift bed, badly beaten up and weak. Mr Deng is wrapping his chest in bandages. \nSimon pauses, then comes closer. He reaches out and touches Henry's shoulder, standing there looking down at his friend. Henry looks up at him, pauses and then gestures vaguely with his hand. \nHENRY Look, Simon, the world's a scary place. I admit it. But it's not my fault. I swear! \nSimon thinks about this and looks away. \nSIMON I'm sorry, Henry. \nHENRY Don't be. You had things to do. \nSIMON So did you. \nHenry thinks about that, sighs and looks away. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nFay packs up the many books of the 'Confession' into one of the old suitcases Henry first came to town with. She slams it shut. \nEXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \n", "test1_input": "Warren shoves himself between it and Simon. \nSimon freezes. Warren is expressionless. Simon looks back at Amy. She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. Leering back over her shoulder, she hisses... \nAMY Kiss my ass. \nSimon is nonplussed. \nGnoc presses a button on the wall that sets... \nA red light flashing above the stockroom door. \nWarren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's bare behind. Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass. \nBut then... Simon throws up all over her. \nWarren falls back in disgust. \nGnoc covers her face with her hands. \nAmy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming bloody murder. \nSimon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear down around her ankles. \nThen Gnoc's father, Mr Deng, appears at the stockroom door holding a shovel and ready to fight. \nWARREN (scared) Oh, shit! \nMr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from the store. Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating delinquents... \nMR DENG (in Vietnamese) Stay the hell out of my store, you good-for-nothing punks! \nHaving scared them off, he comes back in and starts screaming at Simon. \nMR DENG Look at this! What's going on here? Simon, get up off the floor! Is this beer paid for? \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nLater. \nSimon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink, then watches as Henry unpacks one of his suitcases. It is filled with dozens of old, worn notebooks. Henry stacks them on the mantelpiece over the fireplace; the fire is now crackling and bright. \nSimon steps over and looks at... \nThe name tag on the other suitcase: 'Henry Fool'. \nHENRY (off-screen) Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the end. \nSimon looks over and sees... \nHenry's silhouette against the fire. He steps forward into the light and grabs a beer from the six-pack on the floor. He hands one to Simon. \nSimon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his eyes to Henry. \nSIMON Where do you come from? \nHENRY Nowhere in particular. \nHe winks at Simon, then struts around the room, hugely impressed with himself. \nHENRY I go where I will and I do what I must. (stops, drinks) That's why I'm in trouble. I'm sort've what you might call... 'in exile'. \nSIMON Why are you in trouble? \nHENRY (stopping) An honest man is always in trouble, Simon. Remember that. \nSimon comes away from the fire, watching him carefully. Henry stands in a dim corner across the room. \nSIMON How do you know my name? \nHenry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally. He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon. He lifts his finger and points to... \nSimon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt. \nRealizing this, Simon moves off and thinks. \nHenry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his shoulder, laughing mischievously. \nSIMON (stopping him) I am not retarded. \nHENRY (pauses) Well... I'll take your word for that. \nSIMON (explaining) People. I mean. They think. You know. Because. \nHe tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up gesticulating curiously with his hands. This finally dissolves into a dumb stare into empty space. \nHENRY I see. \nSimon looks at him. Henry stands and grabs a notebook from off the mantelpiece. He tears out a few pages and shoves them in his pocket. He hands the now fresh writing tablet to Simon. \nHENRY Here. Take this. And... \nHe searches his pockets and finds a pencil. \nHENRY ...this. Keep them with you at all times. You ever feel like you got something to say and you can't get it out, stop and write it down. OK? \nSimon hesitates, then accepts the gifts. Henry goes for another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of notebooks on the mantelpiece. \nSIMON What are these? \nHENRY (proudly, returning) This? This is my life's work. My memoirs. My 'Confession'. \nSIMON (carefully) What have you done? \nHenry drinks and looks down into the raging fire. \n", "test1_true": "He smokes. Simon is impressed. They hear a bottle smash outside in the street and Henry goes to the window. They're throwing bottles at the house. \nHENRY (throwing down his cigarette) Come on, let's go break their arms! \nSimon jumps up. \nSIMON No! \nHenry stops. Simon looks away and sits back down. \nSIMON (pauses) If I'm quiet. \nHe is ashamed of himself. \nHenry sees this and settles down. He considers his new friend with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette. He lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close by Simon. They sit there in silence a while, then... \nHENRY Once. I forget where I was. Central America maybe. Somewhere hot. Stupid job. Bad pay. Dangerous location and water so foul the natives wouldn't even piss in it. This crowd of drunken motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel shows up at my hotel room and threatens to tear me limb from limb. And I say, listen, hombres, OK, you've got me outnumbered four to one and you're gunna kill me here tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is ever gunna notice I'm gone. Fine. But one of you... one of you... one of you is gunna have his eye torn out. Period. Silence. I repeat myself. One of you poor, underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye ripped out of its socket. I promise. It's a small thing, perhaps, all things considered. But I will succeed. Because it's the only thing I have left to do in this world. So why don't you just take a good look at one another one last time and think it over for a few minutes more. (smokes, waits) They sober up a little, look at their shoes in confusion, then step out into the hall to talk among themselves. \nHenry stares into the flames and falls silent. Simon is riveted. He leans forward, on the edge of his seat... \nSIMON What happened? \nHENRY (winking) Well, here I am, still, after all. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE. UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT \nLater that night. \nSimon climbs the stairs and stops when he hears raunchy sex from his sister's room. He stands outside her door and listens. \nMARY (off) Did you throw up all over some girl? \nSimon looks up the hall and sees his mother in her room, sitting on the edge of her bed, smoking. He approaches and stands in her doorway. \nMARY They were throwing bottles at the house. \nSimon says nothing. He looks down at his feet. \nMARY (gesturing to Fay's room) She's got some ex-con in there she met at the bar. Tattoos all over himself and a big red bloated nose. \nSIMON Did you take your pills? \nNow she says nothing. She smokes and looks away. \nSimon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication. He runs a glass of water and brings it in to her. \nShe swallows the pills and washes them back with water. \nSIMON You want me to tell her to be quiet? \nShe looks away, unconcerned and cynical. \nMARY What's the use? She might as well get it while she can. She's not always gunna have the ass she has now, you know. That's just how life is. \nShe throws the blanket over herself and turns off the light. Simon stands there in the dark. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nMoments later. \nSimon comes downstairs into the quiet, dark kitchen and sits at the table. He listens to the traffic on the highway and stares off into space. Finally, he takes the notebook Henry gave him from his pocket and places it before him. But then he just gazes off into the dim living-room and scratches his head. Returning his attention to the notebook, he digs down into his pocket and retrieves his short stub of pencil. \nHe opens the notebook and carefully flattens back the cover. Lifting the pencil, he pauses and stares at the blank page. Then, after more intense hesitation, he brings the pencil's dull tip to the very top left edge of the page and begins writing in a slow, laborious hand. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY \nThe next morning. \nHenry barges in the kitchen door with two containers of coffee and some jelly donuts. Simon jumps up from where he sits asleep over his notebook at the table. \nHENRY Good morning, Simon! Glorious day, huh? Here, have a donut. Can you lend me twenty dollars? \nSimon rubs the sleep from his eyes, blinks, disoriented and reaches for his wallet. \nHENRY Thanks. Where's the library in the scruffy little burgh? \nSIMON (handing him cash) Down the highway about a mile and a half and then make a left. \nHENRY Excellent! I'm polishing up the final chapters of my 'Confession' and I need a reasonably well-stocked reference section. \nHe lifts up Simon's notebook. \nHENRY What's this? \nSimon hesitates, shyly. \nSIMON I thought. Um. I was. I wanted to. Maybe. \nHe gives up, sighs and gazes at the floor. Henry flips through the book, impressed. It is full from cover to cover, every page dense with Simon's cryptic scrawl. Henry frowns, intrigued. Then... \nHENRY Can I take this? \nSimon looks up, terrified. But his friend puts him at ease. \nHENRY I'll correct the spelling. \nEXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY \nLater that day. \nSimon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing garbage. \nEXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \n", "test2_input": "SIMON Here? \nHENRY Yeah. \nSIMON To go where? \nHENRY Out there. You know, into the world. Where ever. \nSimon looks off, thinks it over and slowly nods. \nSIMON Yeah, I guess. \nHENRY (reciting) 'Opportunity will step away and make room for a man to pass it by.' \nSIMON Is that from your book? \nHENRY No. I found it in a fortune cookie. \nHe pulls the tiny piece of crumpled advice out from one of his pockets and shows it to Simon. \nSIMON Can I read your confession? \nHENRY No. Not yet. Soon. We'll see. \nSIMON Is it almost finished? \nHENRY (puffing himself up) Well, you know, Simon, a piece of work like this, it's... A vocation like ours... You can't put a fence around a man's soul. What I'm trying to achieve, it's... Well, it takes a lifetime really. It's a life's work. (looking around) But soon. Don't worry. I'd appreciate your feedback. I gotta go. See ya. \nHe hurries away around the corner. Simon walks back to the house and stops when he sees... \nA plain-clothes policeman, Officer Bu\u00f1uel, drive up and park before the house. \nSimon spies as the man gets out of his car and knocks on Henry's door. He, of course, gets no answer. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY \nLater that day. \nSimon works on his poem at the kitchen table while Fay flips through a magazine and watches TV. Mary, lying on the couch in her bathrobe, watches her own TV. \nThe cacophony is augmented by the rattling dishwasher and the trucks rumbling by on the highway outside. \nMary looks over at her son, suspicious, and leans off the couch. \nMARY What are you doing there, Simon? \nHe carefully finishes writing a word, then looks up and pauses. \nSIMON I'm writing a poem. \nMary looks at Fay, who looks up from her magazine and considers her brother. Then they break out laughing. \nSimon looks on. \nThey laugh and laugh and laugh... \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nLater. \nSimon is bent over his notebook, consulting a dictionary, hard at work. \nAmy and three kids are grouped around the register, reading the page Henry taped up earlier. As they read, Amy glances anxiously back at Simon. \nThey finish reading and stand back. \nPAT So what? It ain't so great. \nCHRIS (to Amy, of Simon) That him? \nAmy nods 'Yes', then leads them towards Simon. \nSimon scribbles away. \nAMY (off) Pardon me, Simon. \nHe looks up, sees her, panics and slides away on the seat. Amy looks down and bites her lip, contrite. She sighs. \nAMY Uhm. Look, ah... I'm the editor of the high school newspaper now and... \nPAT One of the editors. \nAMY One of the editors, and we... \nPAT You. \nAMY I... wanted to know if we could print your poem in this month's issue. \nSimon looks around at them all, threatened. \nSIMON Why? \nAMY Because I think it's great. \nPAT I don't. \nCHRIS (to Pat) Who cares what you think? \nTED You're a drag. \nCHRIS A well-known drag. \nAMY (to Simon) Please? \nSimon fumbles with his pencil, ill at ease and self-conscious. Then, to get rid of them, he nods his consent. \n", "test2_true": "That evening. \nFay comes downstairs in only a towel and wet hair. She switches on the TV and looks for cigarettes. She finds Mary's pills on the table and remembers to ask... \nFAY Ma, you take your medication? \nMary is lying on the couch. She drags her eyes from the TV and glances lazily at Fay, then back to the TV. \nFAY (to herself) Guess so. \nShe sits at the kitchen table and lifts her magazine. \nHenry shows up at the kitchen door with a pile of library books. His eyes brighten when he sees... \nFay sitting there wearing only her towel. He knocks. She looks back over her shoulder and sees him. \nHENRY Evening, Fay. \nFAY (disdainfully) What do you want? \nHENRY I've got these books for Simon. \nShe turns away. \nFAY Well, leave 'em there on the counter, then. \nHe comes in and stacks the books near the sink. Fay pretends to ignore him, but rakes her fingers through her wet hair anyway, to show more shoulder. \nThis is not lost on Henry, who tarries and leans back against the counter, salivating. \nFay flips through her magazine and Henry steps closer and leans against the fridge. \nShe casts a bored glance in his direction, then returns her attention to the TV. She senses him step aside and follows his movements without turning. Suddenly his hand appears from behind her and gently strokes her hair. She freezes, waits, wonders... \nHe leans his face down beside her. She looks at him. He looks at her, then down to... \nHer bare legs crossed before her on the kitchen chair. His hand moves down and slides itself deep in between her things. \nHer mouth drops open. \nHe looks back up at her. He grins. \nFay jumps up and away, breathlessly clutching the towel around herself. \nHenry casts a glance over her body, throws his hair back out of his face and shivers with lust. \nFay steps back and grabs hold of the staircase banister, making an unconvincing gesture of injured pride. \nHenry comes closer and she steps backwards up the stairs. \nHe stops, loosens his tie, holding her with his gaze. \nShe readjusts her towel, throws back her wet hair, sighs defiantly, then sashays into her room, leaving the door ajar. \nHenry waits there at the foot of the stairs, reaches down, grabs his crotch and repositions his hard-on. He takes a step up the stairs, then stops. He looks over to the couch and sees... \nMary, lying there, sedately amazed. \nHe pauses, then grins. \nMary blinks and smiles sleepily. \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nSame time. \nSimon sits back from his writing and rubs his neck. Putting down his pencil, he looks up and sees... \nWarren enter the store and grab a beer from the cooler. Seeing Simon, he waves and approaches. \nWARREN Hey, Simon, you a registered voter? \nSimon hesitates, but then nods uncertainly. Warren hands him a flyer. This year when you go to the polls, I want you to consider Congressman Owen Feer. He wants to restore America to its position of unmatched wealth, power and opportunity; to revitalize American civilization and lead the human race to even greater levels of freedom, prosperity and security! He's a good man. \nHe steps over to the register and pays for his beer. Mr Deng glares at him, distrustfully. Warren stops on his way out and snarls at the old man... \nWARREN Immigrant. \nHe leaves. Simon looks down and studies the flyer. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE. UPSTAIRS -- DAY \nSame time. \nFay lies across her bed in her towel, holding a pose and glancing anxiously back at the door. Finally, losing her patience, she gets up. \nFAY Where is he? \nShe opens the door and looks out into the hall. \nHe's not there. \nShe steps out into the hall and listens. \nFAY Henry? \nNothing. She comes to the top of the stairs and hears faint activity from down below. She proceeds downstairs. \nShe sees no one in the kitchen, then looks in the living- room and stops. She goes white, her mouth falling open in horror. \nHenry and Mary are screwing one another on the couch. Sloppy, impassioned, brute sex. \nFAY (screaming) Mommy!!!!! \n", "test3_input": "FAY Like what? \nSimon thinks of trying to explain, but then decides not to. \nSIMON 'Opportunity will step out of the way to let a man... pass it by.' \nFAY Are you drunk? \nSIMON Now you have to go out and get a job! \nFAY I am not gettin' a job! (paces, then) Who's gunna look after Mom! \nSIMON I will. \nFay looks at the ceiling and sighs. \nFAY Pearl, go outside. \nThey wait as the child goes outside. \nMary listens, unseen, from her bedroom door. \nFay comes over and frowns at her brother. She's about to lecture him, but he cuts her off. \nSIMON If you treat Mom like a sick person, she's gunna stay like... you know, a sick person. \nFay tries to control herself. She sighs tiredly and attempts to reason with him... \nFAY Simon, don't be retarded... \nSIMON (banging the table) I am not retarded! \nFay steps back, startled. Simon stands, but can't decide which way to go. He sits back down. \nSIMON I can see with my own eyes. \nMary turns away from her door and sits on her bed. \nFay leans over the stove, where a large pot of water is beginning to boil. \nFAY Mom can't be left alone with no one to keep an eye on her. \nSimon is frustrated and lashes out. \nSIMON Well, who's been keeping an eye on her while you've been out getting fucked by every OTB winner in town? \nFay's mouth falls open and she staggers back, hurt. \nSimon regrets it already and stands to leave, scared. But Fay grabs the pot off the stove and hurls it at him, splashing boiling water all over his back. \nSIMON Aggghhhh!!! \nOutside, Pearl turns and looks back at the house. \nSimon lies gasping on the floor of the kitchen. Fay falls back against the stove, terrified and drops her head into her hands. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM -- DAY \nLater. \nFay is crouched on the floor, sobbing, while Simon lies in a tub of cold water. Mary comes in with a pathetic little freezer tray of ice cubes and dumps them into the tub. \nShe steps back into the hall and throws the ice tray down the stairs. She glares back at Fay, who cries even louder as Simon stares up at the ceiling. \nMary shakes her head and walks into her room, slamming the door behind her. \nFAY (sniffling) What happened to her, Simon? How did she get this way? Will it happen to me too? Huh? Why are we so fucked up? \nSimon has no answers. But he reaches out and touches his sister's hand. \nINT. LIBRARY -- DAY \nEvening. \nSimon comes limping in, all stiff because of his scalded back. He's not familiar with the library, so he stands looking around, trying to figure it out. \nINT. LIBRARY STACKS -- DAY \nMoments later. \nHe wanders into an aisle, overwhelmed by all the books. Coming to the far end of the aisle, he looks off to his left and sees Henry sitting on a small stool, reading, with ten or twenty open volumes scattered around him on the floor. \nSIMON (approaching) Henry? \nHENRY (looking up and rising) Simon! What are you doing here? \nSIMON Henry... Your parole officer, Officer Bu\u00f1uel, came by again today. \nHenry sighs and sits back down. \nSIMON He told me to tell you that if you don't call him they're gunna put you back in jail. \nHENRY Simon... \nSIMON He gave me this number... \nHENRY Simon... \nSIMON He was talking to Mr Deng too, and, well, you know, I was thinking... \nHENRY Simon, just shut the fuck up! \nSimon blinks and looks down at his feet, unable to respond. Deeply hurt, he simply turns to walk away. But Henry reaches out and grabs his arm. Simon stops, pauses and looks back at his friend. \nHENRY Forgive me. \n", "test3_true": "HENRY Forgive me, Simon. \nSimon comes back over to him. \nSIMON Call him, Henry. Please. \nHenry gives in slowly to the inevitable. He sighs deeply and stands, handing Simon a book... \nHENRY OK. Look, do me a favor. You got a library card? \nSIMON Yeah. \nHENRY Check this out for me. \nSimon looks at the cover: Paradise Lost. \nHENRY Milton. Seventeenth century. English. You see, Simon, it's important my 'Confession' dig up the past, comb previous evidence and help chart the historic -- even the aesthetic -- inevitability of my ideas. And... \nA young woman passes by, scanning the stacks. She and Henry have a split second of eye contact, then she turns and moves away. Henry straightens his tie and watches her go. \nHENRY This place is crawling with chicks, Simon. Wander around. Leer a little. Cop a feel. Impose yourself on 'em. See what happens. \nSIMON I make girls uncomfortable. \nHENRY Bullshit! You've got a rough hewn charm that sets 'em on edge. Now, listen, I gotta go. \nSIMON Henry? \nHenry stops and turns. Simon pauses, then... \nSIMON What did you do? \nHenry watches him for a moment, then swaggers closer... \nHENRY I got caught. \nSimon waits for more but is disappointed. With one final cracked grin at his friend, Henry throws back his shoulders, slicks back his hair and strides off. Simon watches him go and frowns, not comforted. He flips through the pages of Paradise Lost. \nSIMON (voice over) 'Whereto with speedy words the arch- fiend replied Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable...' \nINT. LIBRARY READING ROOM -- DAY \nMoments later. \nHe comes out from the stacks, working his way through the first page of Paradise Lost. He nearly bumps into a girl and they stop and look at one another. He tries to hold her gaze for a moment, challenging himself, but then turns away and stalks to a table. He sits and leans over the page. \nAfter a moment, though, he lifts his face and glances at... \nAnother girl, sitting further down the table. She looks up from her reading and returns his gaze. \nHe smiles at her. \nShe gets up and leaves. \nSimon frowns, confounded and returns to his book. He takes out his notebook and pencil, meaning to take notes, but sees instead... \nA third girl sitting at another table, listening to her Walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer. \nHe finds himself staring at her and forces himself back to his book. But he can't help himself and glances back over at her. \nWith a sigh, he begins to write in his notebook... \nSIMON (voice-over) Why is it this beautiful girl makes me sad? Does she know how beautiful she is? Do people tell her? Does she ever feel stupid? \nHe looks back over at her. She happens to look up and their eyes meet. She smiles. Horrified, he looks down. \nSIMON Why don't I smile when she looks at me? I look away. Ashamed of myself. \nHe watches her again, thinks, then writes... \nSIMON Her figure makes me violent. I want to somehow break her. But tenderly. How is this possible? Ask Henry. \nHe writes a few moments more, scribbling across the page, then stops and looks back over at the girl. \nSIMON (voice-over) I can't breathe. \nHe tears out the page and folds it in half. Then he gets up and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in her work. She looks up, sees him, and removes her headset with a pleasant smile. He places his note on the table before her, then turns and walks quickly away. \nThe girl watches him go, confused, then lifts the note and reads... \nSIMON (voice-over) Why do I do this to myself? And why do I reduce you to only one possibility? These are not even questions anymore. I know the answers myself. This isn't a page of notes. It's a letter. A letter to you. A desperate act. You are a miracle to me. I can't breathe. \nBy now, Simon is gone from the library. The girl finishes reading the letter and looks around in astonishment. \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nEvening. \nHenry enters and sits with Bu\u00f1uel. \nBU\u00d1UEL How are you, Henry? \nHENRY (frowning) Peachy. Gimme a light. \nBU\u00d1UEL Have you found a job? \nHenry just glares at him and smokes. \nBU\u00d1UEL How 'bout those Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, did you go over and visit them yet? \nHENRY What happened to this assistant librarian position you were supposed to set me up with? \nBu\u00f1uel looks down, disappointed. \n"}

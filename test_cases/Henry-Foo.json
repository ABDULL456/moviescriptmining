{"test1_input": "They fall away from each other in terror and fatigue. Mary clutches wildly at her bathrobe as Henry falls over the coffee table, stumbles to his feet and pulls up his trousers. \nFay is crushed. She breaks out in tears and runs upstairs. \nHenry catches his breath and starts after her, but stops, uncertain and confused. \nMARY You bastard! \nHENRY What? \nMARY Get out! \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nSimon is asleep with his head down on the table. He wakes finally and sees... \nHenry sitting across from him, gripping a beer and reading the poem. He finishes, shuts the book and drinks. \nHENRY Listen. I know a man. He's a big shot in the publishing business. Angus James. Smart, adventurous and tons of integrity. When this thing is ready, I'll recommend he reads it. He'll respect my opinion. \nSimon takes this in, then looks down at his hands and proceeds carefully. \nSIMON A man was here today looking for you. \nHENRY (alert) What man? \nSIMON I don't know. He drove by the house a few times. \nHenry throws his eyes heavenward and pulls his hair. Jumping to his feet, he paces maniacally. \nHENRY Why do they torment me like this? Why? They're like a bunch of fucking mosquitoes! \nA customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves. \nSIMON What do they want from you? \nHENRY They want to suffocate me, Simon! They wanna extinguish me like a flame! \nSome kid named Tim, sitting at another table, turns around and asks... \nTIM But why? \nHENRY They're afraid, that's why! They're afraid of what I might do! What I might say! Think! They're afraid of my ideas! \nHe drinks, then returns and sits beside Simon. \nHENRY You and I are alike in this way, Simon. \nSIMON Yeah? \nHENRY We're outsiders. We think and feel too much and too deeply. And the world can't handle that. Our mere existence is a threat to its illusion of security. Sure, they'll name a wing of a new library after us when we're dead! But now... Now, when we're alive... Now, they wanna burn us at the stake! \nHe drinks, burps, then slams down the can. He glances over at Tim who is still looking on. \nHENRY Scram. \nTim hesitates, but then obeys. He gets up and leaves. Henry returns to Simon. \nHENRY For example, I made love to your mother about half an hour ago and now I'm beginning to think that maybe it wasn't such a good idea. \nSimon blinks. Henry adds... \nHENRY I mean to say, I think Fay may be jealous. \nSimon is deeply confused. He looks ill. He stands and takes a few steps away, staring at the floor. \nSIMON I don't want to think about this. \nHENRY Bad move, Simon. \nSimon stops and looks at him. \nHENRY (pointing at him) A poet has got to be able to think about anything. \nSimon pauses, then comes closer to Henry and stops. \nSIMON Am I really a poet? \nHenry jumps up, strides around the store and speaks at the top of his voice. \nHENRY Of course you are! A great poet! But you need experience. You need to do something to be ashamed of every once in a while, for cryin' out loud. \nHe walks to the door. \nHENRY Come on! Let's go out! There's a den of iniquity right across the street! You got any money? \nHe strides out of the store. \nSimon stands there, stunned and looks at Mr Deng as the old man wipes off the table with a wet rag. \nINT. THE INFERNO -- NIGHT \nLater that night. \nHenry is dancing wildly on the bar with two sloppy-drunk topless dancers. The place is rocking and the crowd cheers them on. \nSimon sits perched on a stool, gripping the bar with white knuckles and clutching a beer, looking on in terror as... \nHenry starts stripping. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT \nLater that night. \nSimon stumbles in and heads upstairs. But he stops, seeing... \n", "test1_true": "MARY That man's a bad influence. \nSIMON On who? \nShe gets up and storms into her room. \nINT. FAY'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nMoments later. \nSimon comes upstairs and stops outside his bedroom door when he sees... \nFay, passed out drunk on her bed. Her clothes are half off and her lipstick smeared. She still grips a bottle of tequila in her hand. \nSimon hesitates, but then goes in and removes her shoes. He gets her out of her jacket and rolls her into the bed. \nHer bare limbs have their effect on Simon and he finds himself staring at her thigh. \nHe reaches out and almost caresses her leg where her hiked- up skirt reveals the bottom of her behind. He catches himself, snaps his hand away and covers Fay with a blanket. \nHe flees. \nINT. SIMON'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nMoments later. \nSimon is alone in the room with his bed. \nThe pale sheets beckon. \nHe is flushed. He blinks. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nMoments later. \nHe creeps down the stairs with an arm-load of books. Sitting at the table, he wrenches a nearby lamp into a more useful position and begins to read. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY \nThe next morning. \nHenry stumbles up the stoop carrying a laptop computer, its various accessories and a couple of coffees. \nHe lets himself in and dumps the computer on the kitchen counter. \nSimon is asleep on the couch, still in his clothes. \nHENRY (shoving him) Simon. Hey, Simon. (Simon wakes) Come on. I got ya some coffee. \nHenry trudges back to the kitchen, where he whips out his red pen and immediately begins to correct Simon's poem. \nSimon rolls off the couch and makes his way to the table. Seeing the computer... \nSIMON What's this? \nHENRY It's a computer. You write on it. \nHe reaches into his pocket. \nHENRY Here's the manual. \nSimon looks over the computer and flips through the manual. \nSIMON Where'd you get it? \nHENRY I stole it. Now listen. Remember how yesterday we discussed the relative desirability of cadence in relation to the readability of... \nFAY (off) Oh, shit! Not you again! \nFay is on the stairs, hungover and disgusted. Henry throws up his hands and gets up to go. \nHENRY Simon, I can't work under these conditions. \nFAY Yeah! Get outta here, you freak! \nHENRY Get a life! \nFAY Eat shit and die, Henry! \nMary throws open her bedroom door. \nMARY (screaming) Beast! Fiend! Rapist! \nFAY Oh, shut up, Mom! \nFay stomps back upstairs. Mary slams her door shut. Simon runs out after Henry. \nEXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nMoments later. \nSimon follows Henry out into the street and over towards World Of Donuts... \nSIMON Henry, wait up! \nHENRY I am not a rapist! \nBut Henry stops short, seeing... \nOfficer Bu\u00f1uel enter World of Donuts. \n", "test1_id": 555, "test2_input": "FAY Like what? \nSimon thinks of trying to explain, but then decides not to. \nSIMON 'Opportunity will step out of the way to let a man... pass it by.' \nFAY Are you drunk? \nSIMON Now you have to go out and get a job! \nFAY I am not gettin' a job! (paces, then) Who's gunna look after Mom! \nSIMON I will. \nFay looks at the ceiling and sighs. \nFAY Pearl, go outside. \nThey wait as the child goes outside. \nMary listens, unseen, from her bedroom door. \nFay comes over and frowns at her brother. She's about to lecture him, but he cuts her off. \nSIMON If you treat Mom like a sick person, she's gunna stay like... you know, a sick person. \nFay tries to control herself. She sighs tiredly and attempts to reason with him... \nFAY Simon, don't be retarded... \nSIMON (banging the table) I am not retarded! \nFay steps back, startled. Simon stands, but can't decide which way to go. He sits back down. \nSIMON I can see with my own eyes. \nMary turns away from her door and sits on her bed. \nFay leans over the stove, where a large pot of water is beginning to boil. \nFAY Mom can't be left alone with no one to keep an eye on her. \nSimon is frustrated and lashes out. \nSIMON Well, who's been keeping an eye on her while you've been out getting fucked by every OTB winner in town? \nFay's mouth falls open and she staggers back, hurt. \nSimon regrets it already and stands to leave, scared. But Fay grabs the pot off the stove and hurls it at him, splashing boiling water all over his back. \nSIMON Aggghhhh!!! \nOutside, Pearl turns and looks back at the house. \nSimon lies gasping on the floor of the kitchen. Fay falls back against the stove, terrified and drops her head into her hands. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM -- DAY \nLater. \nFay is crouched on the floor, sobbing, while Simon lies in a tub of cold water. Mary comes in with a pathetic little freezer tray of ice cubes and dumps them into the tub. \nShe steps back into the hall and throws the ice tray down the stairs. She glares back at Fay, who cries even louder as Simon stares up at the ceiling. \nMary shakes her head and walks into her room, slamming the door behind her. \nFAY (sniffling) What happened to her, Simon? How did she get this way? Will it happen to me too? Huh? Why are we so fucked up? \nSimon has no answers. But he reaches out and touches his sister's hand. \nINT. LIBRARY -- DAY \nEvening. \nSimon comes limping in, all stiff because of his scalded back. He's not familiar with the library, so he stands looking around, trying to figure it out. \nINT. LIBRARY STACKS -- DAY \nMoments later. \nHe wanders into an aisle, overwhelmed by all the books. Coming to the far end of the aisle, he looks off to his left and sees Henry sitting on a small stool, reading, with ten or twenty open volumes scattered around him on the floor. \nSIMON (approaching) Henry? \nHENRY (looking up and rising) Simon! What are you doing here? \nSIMON Henry... Your parole officer, Officer Bu\u00f1uel, came by again today. \nHenry sighs and sits back down. \nSIMON He told me to tell you that if you don't call him they're gunna put you back in jail. \nHENRY Simon... \nSIMON He gave me this number... \nHENRY Simon... \nSIMON He was talking to Mr Deng too, and, well, you know, I was thinking... \nHENRY Simon, just shut the fuck up! \nSimon blinks and looks down at his feet, unable to respond. Deeply hurt, he simply turns to walk away. But Henry reaches out and grabs his arm. Simon stops, pauses and looks back at his friend. \nHENRY Forgive me. \n", "test2_true": "HENRY Forgive me, Simon. \nSimon comes back over to him. \nSIMON Call him, Henry. Please. \nHenry gives in slowly to the inevitable. He sighs deeply and stands, handing Simon a book... \nHENRY OK. Look, do me a favor. You got a library card? \nSIMON Yeah. \nHENRY Check this out for me. \nSimon looks at the cover: Paradise Lost. \nHENRY Milton. Seventeenth century. English. You see, Simon, it's important my 'Confession' dig up the past, comb previous evidence and help chart the historic -- even the aesthetic -- inevitability of my ideas. And... \nA young woman passes by, scanning the stacks. She and Henry have a split second of eye contact, then she turns and moves away. Henry straightens his tie and watches her go. \nHENRY This place is crawling with chicks, Simon. Wander around. Leer a little. Cop a feel. Impose yourself on 'em. See what happens. \nSIMON I make girls uncomfortable. \nHENRY Bullshit! You've got a rough hewn charm that sets 'em on edge. Now, listen, I gotta go. \nSIMON Henry? \nHenry stops and turns. Simon pauses, then... \nSIMON What did you do? \nHenry watches him for a moment, then swaggers closer... \nHENRY I got caught. \nSimon waits for more but is disappointed. With one final cracked grin at his friend, Henry throws back his shoulders, slicks back his hair and strides off. Simon watches him go and frowns, not comforted. He flips through the pages of Paradise Lost. \nSIMON (voice over) 'Whereto with speedy words the arch- fiend replied Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable...' \nINT. LIBRARY READING ROOM -- DAY \nMoments later. \nHe comes out from the stacks, working his way through the first page of Paradise Lost. He nearly bumps into a girl and they stop and look at one another. He tries to hold her gaze for a moment, challenging himself, but then turns away and stalks to a table. He sits and leans over the page. \nAfter a moment, though, he lifts his face and glances at... \nAnother girl, sitting further down the table. She looks up from her reading and returns his gaze. \nHe smiles at her. \nShe gets up and leaves. \nSimon frowns, confounded and returns to his book. He takes out his notebook and pencil, meaning to take notes, but sees instead... \nA third girl sitting at another table, listening to her Walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer. \nHe finds himself staring at her and forces himself back to his book. But he can't help himself and glances back over at her. \nWith a sigh, he begins to write in his notebook... \nSIMON (voice-over) Why is it this beautiful girl makes me sad? Does she know how beautiful she is? Do people tell her? Does she ever feel stupid? \nHe looks back over at her. She happens to look up and their eyes meet. She smiles. Horrified, he looks down. \nSIMON Why don't I smile when she looks at me? I look away. Ashamed of myself. \nHe watches her again, thinks, then writes... \nSIMON Her figure makes me violent. I want to somehow break her. But tenderly. How is this possible? Ask Henry. \nHe writes a few moments more, scribbling across the page, then stops and looks back over at the girl. \nSIMON (voice-over) I can't breathe. \nHe tears out the page and folds it in half. Then he gets up and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in her work. She looks up, sees him, and removes her headset with a pleasant smile. He places his note on the table before her, then turns and walks quickly away. \nThe girl watches him go, confused, then lifts the note and reads... \nSIMON (voice-over) Why do I do this to myself? And why do I reduce you to only one possibility? These are not even questions anymore. I know the answers myself. This isn't a page of notes. It's a letter. A letter to you. A desperate act. You are a miracle to me. I can't breathe. \nBy now, Simon is gone from the library. The girl finishes reading the letter and looks around in astonishment. \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nEvening. \nHenry enters and sits with Bu\u00f1uel. \nBU\u00d1UEL How are you, Henry? \nHENRY (frowning) Peachy. Gimme a light. \nBU\u00d1UEL Have you found a job? \nHenry just glares at him and smokes. \nBU\u00d1UEL How 'bout those Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, did you go over and visit them yet? \nHENRY What happened to this assistant librarian position you were supposed to set me up with? \nBu\u00f1uel looks down, disappointed. \n", "test2_id": 556, "test3_input": "HENRY What happened to you? \nVICKY He's a good man, Henry. Nobody's perfect. \nHENRY I guess not. \nVICKY He's terribly disappointed. \nHENRY I found Pearl wandering around with no shoes on her feet. \nPearl comes over and stands beside her mother. \nVICKY Thanks. She gets scared. \nHENRY And you don't? \nVicky caresses Pearl's hair, then drinks and looks over at Henry. \nVICKY I love him. \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nMoments later. \nBu\u00f1uel is waiting when Henry walks in and steps up to the beer cooler. \nHENRY (alarmed) Where's the beer? \nMR DENG No more beer. Coffee. Espresso! Cappuccino! Caf\u00e9 au lait. Carrot juice. Herbal tea. \nHenry looks at the man, disgusted, then falls in to a seat and motions to Gnoc, who is now the waitress. \nHENRY A double espresso and a jelly donut, Gnoc. (to Bu\u00f1uel) You mind paying? My credit's no good here anymore, apparently. \nBU\u00d1UEL (nods amiably) Did you go to the employment agency today, Henry? \nHENRY No, but it's OK. Simon's gunna try to get me a job on the garbage truck. \nBU\u00d1UEL Listen, I'm a little concerned about your friend. \nHENRY Simon? \nBU\u00d1UEL Seems he gave an obscene note to a girl in the library. \nHENRY Get outta here! When? \nBU\u00d1UEL I'm not sure. \nHENRY It couldn't have been Simon. \nBU\u00d1UEL It almost certainly is. He mentions you. Look... \nHe unfolds a print-out of the letter. Henry reads and Bu\u00f1uel leans over, pointing out... \nHENRY 'Her figure makes me violent. I want to somehow break her. But tenderly. How is this possible? Ask Henry.' \nHenry thinks this over, gulps back some espresso and nods his approval. Then... \nHENRY Bu\u00f1uel, this is obviously a love letter. \nBU\u00d1UEL (taking it back) We've had complaints. \nHENRY Where did you get it? \nBU\u00d1UEL She posted it on the Internet. \nHENRY Oh, the slut! \nBU\u00d1UEL She was trying to warn other girls about a potential rapist. \nHENRY (smokes) Is all this true about the Internet? About how you can get pornography on it? \nBU\u00d1UEL Well, yeah, sure. It's a big problem. You can send dirty pictures and everything. \nHENRY On the Internet? \nBU\u00d1UEL Yeah. \nHenry is impressed. \nHENRY No kiddin'? \nBu\u00f1uel gets up to go. \nBU\u00d1UEL See you on Thursday, Henry. \nHENRY (thinking) Sure. See you. (calls the waitress) Gnoc, gimme one of these double espressos to go, will ya? \nHe is having ideas. \nINT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY \nMoments later. \nFay, still dressed in black, is tapping away on the keys to the computer, surfing the Internet, as Henry appears at the kitchen door, gripping his tall double espresso. \nHENRY Hello, Fay. \nFAY Go away. \nHENRY You gotta get outta the house, Fay. You can't blame yourself for not being here. You did all you could for her. \nShe turns and glares at him. \nFAY Is there something you want? \n", "test3_true": "HENRY You got the Internet on that contraption? \nFAY (resumes typing) Yeah. So what? \nHe changes the subject again, preoccupied and continues tenderly... \nHENRY Look Fay, about, you know, between us -- what happened... \nFAY I don't wanna talk about it, Henry! \nHe sighs and drinks his coffee, then looks back at her. \nHENRY Type a part of Simon's poem onto the Internet. \nFAY (stops) What? \nHENRY Go ahead. \nFAY No. \nHENRY Why not? \nFAY Because. \nHENRY Come on, Fay. It's a great idea. \nFAY I don't know if he would want us to do that. \nHENRY Sure he would. Just the first ten verses. \nFay is tempted. \nFAY I don't know. \nHENRY He'll thank you for it later. \nFrowning, she reconsiders. She gets up and takes the notebooks from the cabinet above the fridge. She flips through the pages but suddenly stops and turns to the door with a nicer attitude. \nFAY Henry... \nBut he's gone. It's as if he has vanished into thin air. She sighs, sits back down, and begins typing the poem onto the Internet. \nINT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY \nMoments later. \nHenry comes back into the store, satisfied with himself. He finishes off his coffee, tosses away the cup and takes a pornographic magazine from the rack. He leans on the counter where Mr Deng is busy working and flips through the pages. \nHENRY Gimme another one of those tall double espressos, Mr Deng. \nMr Deng starts to make him one and sees him with the magazine. \nMR DENG You gunna buy that? \nHENRY I'm just looking. \nMR DENG Well then put it back. \nHENRY There's this fascinating story about a famous rock band and how they tied a friend of theirs to a bed in their hotel room and inserted a live fish into her vagina. \nMr Deng shakes his head and frowns. \nHENRY (explains) They say she had numerous orgasms. \nMR DENG Henry, you need to do something with your life. Get a job, or something. \nHENRY I mean, it wasn't the entire fish, it was just, you know, the nose. The nose of the fish. \nMr Deng brings over the coffee. Henry is surprised to notice he is not riveted. \nHENRY You don't find that interesting? \nMR DENG No. \nHenry closes the magazine and puts it back. Leaning on the counter, he sips his coffee and ponders. \nHENRY You ever wonder what it would be like to have sex with an animal, Mr Deng? \nMR DENG That coffee is free. Just take it and get out of here. \nHENRY I mean, some dogs are almost as big as people and often more attractive. \nMr Deng just goes back to work, leaving Henry there at the counter thinking big thoughts. \nEXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- EVENING \nSimon hangs from the garbage truck as it comes up the street and pauses in front of his house. He jumps down and the truck barrels away. \nINT. FAY'S ROOM -- EVENING \nSimon taps at the door. She looks over at him and he sees she's been crying. He comes into the room and she sits up on the edge of the bed. \nSIMON Did you see him? \nFAY He came by this afternoon. \nSIMON Did you talk? \nFAY No. \nHe comes over and sits beside her. He thinks a moment, then... \nSIMON You've got to tell him, Fay. \n", "test3_id": 557}

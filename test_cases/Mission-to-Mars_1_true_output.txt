MCCONNELL Check for radiation. 
Luke punches buttons, waits anxiously for a readout. 
LUKE Normal. Seismic... normal. Anemometer steady. No sign of the vortex. 
PHIL I don't know what we did, but guys -- does that look to you like a hostile gesture? 
TERRI No. More like an invitation. 
LUKE Or another test... 
McConnell is staring at the mysterious opening. On his face, a growing look of determination. 
MCCONNELL Luke, the four-man rover. Does it still work? 
The others look at him, their expressions changing as they realize what he's implying.

EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. LATE DAY 
McConnell, once again helmeted, emerges from the Hab airlock. Luke, Terri and Phil are coming out behind him. The wind has picked up, and fine dust is blowing. They stop, staring off in astonishment towards 
A FRIGHTENING SIGHT 
The entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into purplish-black at the horizon, with bloody streaks above. The DUST STORM has turned their way; it's now sixty kilometers away and closing. The main body of it reaches two thousand meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand- kilometer front. 
THE ASTRONAUTS 
Stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed. McConnell turns to Luke, whose expression is grim. 
MCCONNELL How long before it hits? 
LUKE An hour? Maybe less. 
MCCONNELL How bad? 
LUKE A storm like that? It could go planetary. And last a year. 
McConnell stares at him. 
LUKE It'll sock us in, Jim. We won't be able to take off. If that happens, with what few supplies we've got left...? We'll starve to death. 
McConnell turns, staring off towards the killer storm. The others look at him with questioning gazes. He turns again. There's the four-man rover, ready to go. Waiting. 
MCCONNELL Phil, how much longer to prep the ERV? 
PHIL Maybe forty-five minutes. It'll be tight, but we can make it. 
MCCONNELL Then there's still time for us to get out there and back. 
He looks a question at Luke and Terri, one after the other. Their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement. 
MCCONNELL Stay here. Continue the repair. If something goes wrong, you get out of here before that storm hits. 
PHIL Go back... alone? 
MCCONNELL If we're not back in forty-five minutes, I want you to prep and launch. (looks at his armpad display) That's 1950 hours. 
PHIL Jim -- 
MCCONNELL It's not a suggestion, it's an order. You understand? 
PHIL (reluctantly) I understand. But -- 
MCCONNELL You understand what? 
PHIL If you're not back by 1950, I prep and launch. 
McConnell nods, satisfied. Looks at Terri and Luke. 
MCCONNELL Let's go. 
They start towards the four-man rover. Dust is swirling more thickly through the air, and the WIND IS LOUDER NOW. Phil stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure. 
EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DUSK 
In a WIDE SHOT, we see the rover approaching the Face, across the plains. The sky beyond the Face is almost black, as the storm approaches from that direction. It's marching relentlessly across the planet, with flashes of lightning now rippling up and down its face, and even small tornadoes spinning off near its purple-black base... 
INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK 
Phil has panels off. He's reaching into the guts of the main computer, working feverishly. His repair kit is beside him. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. DUSK 
In a HIGH SHOT, we look down across the side of the Face and its vast, open doorway, out of which the bright white light is streaming. Into this corridor of light, we see the rover arrive, slewing to a stop, throwing sand from its wheels. 
GROUND LEVEL SHOT 
Looking at the cavernous vertical gap in the side of the Face. The opening towers to a dizzying height above us; the white light strains our eyes. The three astronauts ENTER FRAME as we see them, from behind, staring up. 
ON THE ASTRONAUTS' AWED FACES 
As they are stunned by the immensity of the scene, the cosmic mystery before them. Luke and Terri look at McConnell. Another moment of critical decision. He keys his mike. 
MCCONNELL Phil, do you read me?

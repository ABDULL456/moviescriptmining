MITCH Yes. 
LYDIA How long have you known her? 
MITCH I told you. We met yesterday. 
LYDIA In a bird shop. 
MITCH Yes. 
LYDIA She was selling birds. 
MITCH No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated. 
LYDIA But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way... 
MITCH Mother, where did you go to law school? 
LYDIA (laughing) Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. (pause) She's very rich, isn't she? 
MITCH I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco. 
LYDIA You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch. 
MITCH I know, Mother. 
LYDIA She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she? 
MITCH Yes, Mother. 
LYDIA Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. (pause) I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked. 
MITCH I know, Mother. 
LYDIA It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to... 
MITCH Mother? 
LYDIA (looking up) Yes? 
MITCH I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself. 
LYDIA Well... (she sighs) So long as you know what you want, Mitch. 
MITCH I know exactly what I want, Mother. 
DISSOLVE 
FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER LAWN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT 
as Mitch and Melanie cross it to her car. A wind is blowing off the water, and high fast clouds are scudding across the face of the moon. 
MITCH You'll be able to find your way back, won't you? 
MELANIE Oh, yes. 
MELANIE Will I be seeing you again? 
MELANIE San Francisco's a long way from here. 
MITCH I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you. (he grins) Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim. 
MELANIE How does Mother know what I like to do? 
MITCH I guess she and I read the same gossip columns. 
MELANIE Oh. That. Rome. 
MITCH Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very... 
MELANIE In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain. 
MELANIE Without any clothes on? 
MELANIE With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said... 
MITCH You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh? 
MELANIE I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular... 
MITCH The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd... 
MELANIE Yes, but... 
MITCH ...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or... 
MELANIE Yes. 
MITCH ...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth? 
MELANIE Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too. 
MITCH Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth? 
MELANIE No. (pause) At least, I didn't until I came up here. 
MITCH So you didn't go to school together. 
MELANIE No. 
MITCH And you didn't come up here to see her. 
MELANIE No. 
MITCH You were lying. 
MELANIE Yes, I was lying. 
MITCH Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too? 
MELANIE I wrote the letter. 
MITCH What did it say? 
MELANIE It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said. 
MITCH But you tore it up. 
MELANIE Yes. 
MITCH Why? 
MELANIE Because it seemed stupid and foolish. 
MITCH Like jumping into a fountain in Rome! 
MELANIE I told you what happened in Rome! 
MITCH Do you expect me to believe...? 
MELANIE I don't give a damn what you believe! 
Angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door when Mitch catches it in his hands.

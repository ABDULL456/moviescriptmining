{"train": "RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES \nWritten by \nRick Jaffa & Amanda Silver \nPrevious revisions by \nJamie Moss \nJanuary 8th, 2010 \nEYES. Expressive, alive. Human? No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES. \nEXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY \nShe sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular, a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A \nSHOOTING STAR. Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays. \nEXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY \nA DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle. They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance. As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready. \nEXT. CANOPY - DAY \nAlpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight. He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR ignites the community - but too late. POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER. Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his teeth and sends her off. Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging. MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING - an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe. Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER \nFROM HIS MOUNT. Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to rally a counter-attack. But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to the defense. It's chaos. SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by one. Others take off. \nAlpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air... \nA SHOT RINGS OUT. \nBRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE \nAIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE. \nFADE TO WHITE TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us. FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly red hair under a sterile cap. \nCAROLINE Nanotherapy, beta version: Tuesday, March 10, 2011. Female Test subject Number four. Franklin reaches for us, smiles... \nFRANKLIN Here we go, Bright eyes. A MIST fogs our view for a moment. \nCAROLINE Not too much. She needs to be calm, but alert. \nVOICE THROUGH INTERCOM Go ahead - send her through. A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top. Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED: A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK. Bright Eyes. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME \nWILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified chimpanzee slide into the machine. The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress. \nWILL Start the scan. A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will. \nTECHIE Scanning. \nINT. WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nAnother tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the machine, sending the restrained animal into the scanner. Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID. \nDONNIE Stuff looks like Kool-aid. \nCAROLINE Go ahead, I'm sure you could use it. \n(OPENING VALVE) Starting the therapy... \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME \nWill looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP. The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR \nRESTRAINTS. \nEXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DUSK (AERIAL) \nWill drives over the majestic Golden Gate Bridge. \nEXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWill pulls up in front of his house. Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought. As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER \nAND OVER ON A PIANO. \nINT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe, stabbing at the key with his finger. Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the emotional weight of this man, his father. \nWILL Hey Dad. Walter looks up, whispers... \nWALTER John... is that you? \nWILL It's me. Will. \nWALTER As thou dost, Anthony. (staring at the keys) .he hears no music. No music... \nVOICE (heavy Russian accent) He's been doing that all day. A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA. \nIRENA He found an old book of his. She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back. \nIRENA (CONT'D) (shrugging on coat) I had no idea you liked Shakespeare so much, Mr. Walter. \nWILL My mother was the one. She liked Shakespeare... \nIRENA \n(KISSES HIM) Good night, Walter, hone-ee. She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm. \nI WILL Come on, Dad. \nINT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWill helps his father change into pajamas. \nWILL Remember I told you we were using Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on the apes? Well the therapy seems to be working. We've seen definite signs of adult brain neurogenesis. Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top. \nWILL (CONT'D) Board of Directors is coming in a couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 - that's clinical trials. Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less understanding what Will's saying. \nWILL (CONT'D) Human trials, Dad. Soon. \nWALTER I rather tell that what is to be feared than what I fear: for always... I am Caesar... There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries.. \nWILL I'm going to make you better - I swear it. His father looks at him. A moment of recognition? \nWALTER John... ? \nWILL \n(DISAPPOINTED) No, Dad, it's me. Will. Will helps the old man under the bedcovers. \nWILL (CONT'D) John's gone. He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.) \nWill looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away. \nINT. WILL'S STUDY - LATE NIGHT \nIt's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer. He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works. \nINT. PRIMATE LAB - DAY \nFranklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes. \nFRANKLIN Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam. Monty. Hey - what's the matter, don't like my cooking? \nSUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her cage. \nINT. LAB - DAY \nDONNIE She's breaking my hand! \nCAROLINE Let go, Bright Eyes! You're hurting him! She tries to help pull Donnie away. \nCAROLINE (CONT'D) Let go! In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own. \nLUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND \nTHE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY. \nHE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH. \nFRANKLIN Lucky no! Stop! \n(TO CAROLINE) Hit the alarm! Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it. \nDONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO... \nINT. LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME \nLOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he scampers - unattended - down the hall. \nGUARD #1 Uh oh. Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN \nSILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO \nGET HIM FREE. \nGUARD #2 Hey, Len...? Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket... Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet... \nEXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY \nLucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest building. \nINT. BOARDROOM - DAY \nThe room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's pronouncement. \nBOARD MEMBER What about the safety of the virus? \nWILL Perfectly safe. We're using the most stable - A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS. Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW. \nWILL (CONT'D) \nNO! Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and pinning him to the wall. It happens fast. The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY \nINCISORS... \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK. The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again. \nWill watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams - collapses on the boardroom table. \nEXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT \nRain and fog. An AMBULANCE pulls out, past POLICE CRUISERS and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS. Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder packed in ice. He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him. \nWILL Are they gone? \nJACOBS Long gone. Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway. \nWILL Did they say anything before they left? I mean, about Phase 2. \nJACOBS Look around you, for Christ sakes. We'll be lucky if we don't go to jail. Will's gutted - devastated. \nWILL But we're so close. \nJACOBS You think you're the only one who's got something at stake here? I've got my own skin in this game! \nWILL What happened had nothing to do with the 112. (desperate to clarify) Take an already aggressive animal, make it smarter - you're going to get a potentially dangerous \nSITUATION - \nSTEWART When I was examining his eyes, I noticed a strange green pigmentation. \nWILL Green? His heart starts to pound. \nSTEWART Green. Never.seen it before. She hands Will an OTOSCOPE. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) Take a look. Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds \nFLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) It's faint, can you pick it up? He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) You alright? Want a glass of water? \nWILL No thanks. \n(EMBARRASSED) Sure, that would be good. She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over. \nWILL (CONT'D) Forgot to eat today. Not a big deal. \nStewart hands him the glass. He downs it. \nWILL (CONT'D) \n(TO CAESAR) I'm fine. Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good. \nSTEWART Carotid pulse is running a little fast. \nWILL For a human or a chimpanzee? First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face. \nSTEWART Gotta remember to eat. \nINT. MOVING CAR - DAY \nWill drives Caesar, both of them licking soft-serve ice cream cones. He pulls up outside a store: \"SMART CHILD\" \nEDUCATIONAL TESTING TOYS. \nWILL (O.S.) You have to move the whole tower to another peg, one block at a time. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nWalter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it. Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'. Irena stands next to Will, watching Caesar. There's also a CAMCORDER on a tripod. \nWILL Here's the hard part: you can't put a larger block on top of a smaller one. Caesar studies the puzzle. \nWILL (CONT'D) Understand? \nCaesar's already started. He methodically begins moving blocks from one pole to another, pausing, backtracking, getting it right, never a bigger one on top of a smaller... Will watches, increasingly amazed, as he re-creates the tower on a different pole. It's easy for him. Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&MS. \nWILL (CONT'D) \n(STUNNED) He did it in fifteen moves. \nIRENA What's the best score? \nWILL Fifteen. Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall. \nIRENA \n(AMAZED) I wonder where he gets such talent? \nWILL (eyes on Walter) It was passed down from his mother. \nINT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT \nWill uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT. \nWILL (into computer mic) At age two Caesar appears to exceed his mother's aptitude. He signs over three hundred words. He exhibits no visible side effects from the therapy... \nINT. GARAGE - NIGHT \nTODD AND FRIEND Monkey in the middle, monkey in the middle... Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep- away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE \nFEELS SORRY FOR HIM. \nTHEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S \nGOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE. They're making fun of him. \"MONKEY\", \"MONKEY\", \"MONKEY\"... The chanted words ring in Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd, stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils. Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face. Alice runs inside. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nWill and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 HUNSIKER'S YELL. Will runs for the neighbor's house. \nEXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY \nHunsiker approaches Caesar with a raised bat. The terrified chimp backs toward his fence. \nHUNSIKER Hah! Hah - Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him. \nWILL Hold on - it's okay - he's harmless! \nHUNSIKER Your monkey came onto my property! Threatened my kids! By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate. \nWILL It won't happen again... \nHUNSIKER Damn right it won't happen again! I'll press charges if it does! Will holds Caesar close and hurries home. \nINT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY \nSTEWART What does he do for fun? Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little thrown by the question. \nWILL Well we've got puzzles, games, a swing set... \nSTEWART My guess is he needs more. More exercise, more space. \nWILL We'll work on that. Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening. \nHe gets up his nerve. \nWILL (CONT'D) What about you? \n(BEAT) What do you do for fun? She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't understand the question. \nWILL (CONT'D) How about dinner and a movie? Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears. \nSTEWART I'm sorry, did you say something? He starts to try again - but the moment's gone. \nWILL No - nothing. Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed. Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something - but Will doesn't say more. \nEXT. MUIR WOODS, ESTABLISHING - DAY \nFrom high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST. \nINT. MOVING CAR - DAY \nCaesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window, extremely excited. \nEXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DAY \nAs Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car. The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar tugging at the leash. \nWALTER Take him off the leash. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 WILL There's a place up ahead. \nEXT. PARK/CLEARING - DAY \nThey've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will kneels next to Caesar. \nWILL Don't go far. Stay where I can see you. Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's gratifying to see Caesar so happy. The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A \nGROVE OF TREES. \nCaesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless. He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their posture, their gait. \nBUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A \nCHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES. \nTHERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST \nLIKE ALPHA'S. He runs two fingers down the length of it. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCaesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's tension here, but we can't place it yet. Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil, staring at it. \nWILL Turn it around, Dad. You're using the wrong end. Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending. With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the old man, adjusting the spoon. Will watches. Heartbroken. \nINT. LAB - DAY \nA MOUSE runs through a MAZE. It reaches a fork in the path, leading to two different plastic objects, one green, one orange. The mouse hesitates, confused. He backs away from the cone. A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him, reading the number results on a monitor. Will's obviously discouraged. \nWILL The drug's not staying ahead of the disease. \nJACOBS But we're still making progress, right? Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written all over his face. \nWILL Sure. At this pace we'll get to trials by the time Hell freezes over. Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside. \nJACOBS This isn't graduate school - there's a procedure we have to adhere to. \nWILL It'll take forever. I need to start developing a primate version now. Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time. \nJACOBS How's your father? Haven't seen him in a while. \nWILL This isn't about him. \nJACOBS He's worse, isn't he? Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't. \nWILL \n(EVASIVE) He's fine. \nWE HEAR A PERSISTENT C SHARP COMING FROM A DISTANT PIANO. It's a familiar, baleful SOUND that continues over the following... \nINT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY \nWill sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed with MPEGs of Caesar doing puzzles and games. \nWILL (into computer mic) Caesar continues to maintain a high level of cognition. But Walter's disease has caught up to the neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all initial improvement has been erased... Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWalter sits at the piano, hitting his one note. Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study. \nINT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY \nCaesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands. Will senses his presence. Looks up. \nCAESAR Who Caesar. \nWILL What do you mean? \nCAESAR Who. With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and tries to understand what Caesar wants from him. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) Who. \nWILL Caesar is an ape. \n(SIGNING) A chimpanzee. \nCAESAR No \"what\". \"Who\". Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual leap Caesar's taken. \nWILL Are you asking about your identity? That's abstract thought, Caesar. Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.' \nHUNSIKER Aaaaaaaah! Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE \nOF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK. \nWALTER Caesar! Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Please stop. Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and sprints for his house. \nCAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S \nTOO BIG TO FIGHT. He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS HEAD HITS THE PAVEMENT, stunning him. \nEXT. HUNSIKER'S HOUSE - DAY \nJust as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to block Hunsiker's entrance. White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nHunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder - Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit. He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in. Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR \nHAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET. Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running. Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE \nLANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH. Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street. \nEnjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree branch and swings from tree to tree. with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey. Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying. Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers. \nHUNSIKER Please no... Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph. But then he sees something across the street that abruptly pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY - \nBEING HELPED TO HIS FEET. He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing. All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nWill's car drives down a two-lane highway. \nREPORTER (V.0.) .chimpanzee named Caesar, terrorizing the quiet family enclave and mauling neighbor Douglas Hunsiker, a pilot for Global Airlines. \nINT. JACOBS' LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJacobs watches the evening NEWS. \nREPORTER The defense claimed the chimp was merely trying to protect its owner from perceived aggression. FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews. Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume. \nREPORTER (CONT'D) The chimpanzee's distraught owner, Wilson Rodman, has raised the animal since he was an infant. \n(MORE) \nREPORTER (CONT'D) He pleaded to keep Caesar at home, citing the ape's remarkable intelligence. Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded. \nINT. MOVING CAR \u00c2\u00bb- DAY \nWill and Caesar drive. Caesar's dressed up - khaki pants and a Polo shirt. \nWILL We're visiting a place called \"The Ranch\". They have animals. \nCAESAR Real animals? \nWILL You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans... Caesar GRUNTS, excited. \nWILL (CONT'D) It'll be good. You'll like it very much. Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something. \nCAESAR Will sad? \nWILL What? No, I'm fine. \nEXT. THE RANCH - DAY \nAs Will pulls into the entrance, Caesar's glued to the window. \nINT. MOVING CAR - DAY \nThey pull into a CLEARING. Ahead is a new world - CONCRETE AND STEEL BUILDINGS set incongruously into the bucolic countryside. A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all cold, efficient structures. \nCAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE. \nDODGE Caesar. Hey. I can get you out. Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING. \nDODGE (CONT'D) This way. \nCaesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight. Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car. He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into... \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY \n.the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks. This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES. Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND \nTHEIR CAGES. \nDODGE Caesar - over here. Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE \nREALIZES IT'S A DEAD END. He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT. \nCAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Stupid monkey. \nFOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS \nTHE BETRAYAL. Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to the ceiling, searching for a way out. To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right: \nTHREE MORE CHIMPANZEES. Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW THE SCREAM as it spreads out over the property... \nEXT. MOVING CAR - DAY \n.and finds the Will's car, driving down the winding road, away from the Ranch. \nINT. MOVING CAR - DAY \nWill keeps driving, TEARS streaming down his face. \nINT. CAESAR'S CAGE -- LATER \nTime has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon. Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the cage, heavy head resting on his arms. He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE, followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up. In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR \nCHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD \nACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN. This is ROCKET. He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL. He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a challenging eye to Caesar. \nSCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM! A terrifying display of power and dominance. \nDODGE (O.S.) Okay, assholes. Dinner time. Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening look to Caesar - moves off. Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out. Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in an occasional rotted vegetable. The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet- looking dog food. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow. Bet you don't get none of that in the suburbs. Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Think that's funny? That funny to you, you hairy prick? Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER. \nRODNEY Look at that! Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage. \nDODGE One thing you can count on: Long as there are humans on this earth, you'll always be a monkey in a cage. The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards. Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his back as a shield. The water BLAST is relentless. Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the floor. \nRODNEY What about his clothes? Might cause problems with the other apes. \nDODGE Leave 'em. \nEXT. BACK YARD - DAY \nWalter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's swing set. Empty. Useless in the back yard. The Aide stands nearby, sending a text message. \nINT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY \nWill looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on the sofa, surrounded by reminders of Caesar - puzzles, games, etc. The newspaper's unread beside him. \nWALTER (O.S.) John? Walter enters, looks at Will. \nWALTER (CONT'D) John - where's Caesar? The old man looks stricken. \nCaesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet floor, along with the detritus of feeding time. He can HEAR the APES in the distance. Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE. \nEXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING \nCaesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE \nBRIDGE: THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty. And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla, BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on toward the atrium. The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK. Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps, orangutans with orangutans. They haven't noticed him yet. \nEXT. ATRIUM - DAY \nCaesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED \nLIKE A HUMAN. \nHE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN \nEYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE \nMORE UPRIGHT... Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM. Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage? \nHe spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait. Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then tosses it to Rocket. Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge. \nAFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET \nSWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM. Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the material. Caesar jerks his arm away. Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms. Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest. Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws Caesar to the ground, pinning him. Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket across the face. OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest. Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on. Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs at his shirt, drags Caesar closer. He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and... \n.ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS. BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter. Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder. Caesar starts to move off - \nBAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF \nCAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS. \nBAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN. \nCaesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him. Out cold. \nINT. RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY \nCaesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED. His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants, now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST, \nPINNING HIM TO THE TABLE. It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment. Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing, restrained to a medical table. Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings. \nVOICE Caesar. Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head. \nSTEWART Do you remember me? I'm Dr. Stewart. She hands him a cup of water with a straw. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) Drink. Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly doesn't understand. He signs again. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) I don't understand. Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak? \nSTEWART (CONT-D) Can you show me? Show me what you need. Caesar pulls at the restraints. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) I can't take those off. Caesar sags with defeat, overcome with DESPAIR. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) I'm sorry this has happened, Caesar. So sorry. Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his emotion, the obvious intelligence behind his pain. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) I'm here once a week. I'll do my best to look after you. \nEXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY \nDodge pulls heavy bags of Primate Chow from a truck, stacking them in a SHED. He spots Stewart striding towards him, and-- Ducks out of sight, vainly brushing back his hair. \nSTEWART (O.S.) What were you thinking? \nDODGE oh, hey Doc. \nSTEWART That chimp needs protection. Dodge's face falls. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) You could've gotten him killed. \nDODGE \nWILL Thank you... I appreciate that. Awkward beat. \nSTEWART Well. If you give me your number I'll let you know from time to time how things are going - \nWILL Let's grab a drink. Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too. She's happy he asked. \nSTEWART Love to. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - NIGHT \nNighttime. \nINT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT \nA repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the orangutans sleep. ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck, windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed. 40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney. \nCaesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee. \nDODGE Want a beer? The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Here's a little taste of beer... He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH. Caesar watches, disgusted. \nINT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE -- MORNING \nA LEVER THROWN OPEN. Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages in succession. Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE \nATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN. \nDODGE & RODNEY Move it! Let's go! Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move across the bridge. On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE, ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out, then moves off to join the others. Caesar maneuvers to get a better view. Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS \nHAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE. Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE. Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable. Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out? Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S \nCAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE. \nHis heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to contain his excitement. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY \nWill waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's clearly thrilled to see him. \nWILL There you are! I heard what happened. \nCAESAR \n(SIGNING) Home now. Caesar home. He tugs Will away from Dodge. \nWILL I'm going to get you out of here, but not today. I'm working on it. Caesar's face falls. \nWILL (CONT'D) Soon. I promise. Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD. \nCAESAR \n(SIGNING) Home. Still a question, a flicker of hope. \nWILL (kills him to say it) Not yet. I can't yet. Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here. First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and starts walking back to his cage. \nWILL (CONT'D) Wait a second - Caesar, where are you going? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking. Dodge catches up with him. \nDODGE (loud enough for Will) No place like home, huh monkey boy? \nWILL Caesar - come back here! He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run. \nEXT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - DAY \nDodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the... \nEXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY \n.storage shed. He notices Will's car still parked in front of the office... just as - BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he might've just broken his hand. \nWILL You son of a bitch. Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose. \n(THROUGH MASK) Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he? Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO \nKOBA'S NOSE AND MOUTH. \nTHE CHIMPANZEE CONVULSES ON THE TABLE. \nINT. STEWART'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCHOP STICKS digging into take-out Chinese. Stewart and Will sit in her kitchen, eating. It's clear from their state of dress (or undress) that they've been intimate. Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time with the chopsticks. \nSTEWART You actually punched him? \nWILL I did. She thinks it's funny. \nSTEWART I've been wanting to do that since the day I met him. \nWILL I don't advise it. My hand's killing me. \nSTEWART Here. Let me help you out. She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his chopsticks. \nWILL I'm going to get him out of there. \nSTEWART I know you are. \nWILL And I'm going to get my dad back too. \nINT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT \nCaesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a THREE-FOOT LONG \"ARM\". He tapes the scissors firmly to its end, finger holes sticking out. Finished. Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE \nCONTRAPTION, HE LOOPS THE FINGER HOLES OVER THE LATCH. He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps trying... until finally the loop's in place. Then he begins to tug. Tug. Tug. CLICK - the LATCH OPENS. He glances over to Maurice, who silently watches. Caesar pushes open the cage door. MAURICE'S EYES FOLLOW HIM \nINTO THE NIGHT. \nEXT. BRIDGE AREA - NIGHT \nCaesar walks across the bridge. He passes the entrance to the chimpanzee house - and keeps going. \nEXT. GORILLA HOUSE - NIGHT \nHe arrives at the Gorilla House. Buck's visible in his cage, asleep on a bed of straw. Caesar unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door. He waits, but Buck doesn't budge. He's still fast asleep. Caesar hesitates. Then he slowly... \nINT. BUCK'S CAGE - NIGHT \n.enters the cage, edging up to the sleeping gorilla. From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest rising and falling with sleep. Caesar very carefully wiggles his toe. There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face. Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door. Buck understands but can't believe it. For a moment he doesn't move. Caesar makes the gesture again -- \"Come on, let's go.\" Before he can finish, Buck bursts past him... \nEXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \n.across the bridge... \nEXT. ATRIUM - NIGHT \n.and into the atrium. Caesar follows. The full moon shines down on Buck, the tree, the climbing structure. The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step. Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the way across the atrium, then all the way back. Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom. Caesar stands back, silently watching. \nEXT. STORAGE SHED - MORNING \nA morning like any other. Dodge goes through his routine: 0 opening the door, wheeling out a wheelbarrow. \nHe makes his way to the ape houses. \nEXT. GORILLA HOUSE - MORNING \nDodge and his wheelbarrow approach the Gorilla House. Closer and closer to the cage... until they're right in front. The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate chow into the gorilla's trough. \nBUCK TAKES A HANDFUL AND LOOKS ACROSS TO CAESAR, WHO RETURNS \nHIS GAZE FROM THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE. \nINT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - MORNING \nCaesar senses something: Maurice is staring at him. Caesar 's beginning to wonder what Maurice wants when the ORANGUTAN \nWILL (CONT'D) You know what I want. You're just not going to give it to me. Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT, \nDISQUIETING. \nAND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK \nSOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN... \nWILL (V.0.) (CONT'D) What do you think of Koba? \nINT. PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY \nWe look through cage bars at Will and Franklin, who stand far away, across the room. \nFRANKLIN You wanna know if I think the 113's making him nuts. \nWILL I know he's smart. But there's something else, something worrisome. He challenges me. Taunts me. Will looks toward us, toward the bars. \nWILL (CONT'D) (almost to himself) I don't want to try it on... \n(CATCHES HIMSELF) .I don't want to start human trials if there's any chance of danger. \nFRANKLIN What you're seeing has nothing to do with the 113, Doc. The apes're just like us - they're complex. Some are loyal, some are selfish, some have a good sense of humor. And some are born rotten. Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of view, from inside the cage. Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 face frame the two men across the room. \nFRANKLIN (CONT'D) This one's a bad apple, that's all. A chill runs down Will's spine. \nEXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES/MAIN GATE - DAY \nA car pulls up to the gate. Evans is driving. He looks ill. \nGUARD \n(OPENING GATE) Early day today, Evans? \nEVANS Actually I'm not feeling too good. \nEVANS GETS A SHIVER. \nGUARD You know what: Whiskey, lemon, honey and a cup of hot water. Never fails. \nEVANS Thanks - I'm on it. Evans drives off. \nEXT. PADDOCK - DAY \nStewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at the chimpanzee area. She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the others make way for him. Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar so at ease with the other apes. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY \nROCKET'S MISERABLE. Dodge and Rodney watch him through the bars. \nRODNEY Still won't eat, won't come out. \nDODGE I can fix that. Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Get that monkey ass out of there! \nINT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY \nCaesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't struggle, doesn't fight back. The harsh jet pelts his back. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT \nRocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him. Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down. At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS. Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - NIGHT \nRocket exits warily, on his guard for anything... But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla. No shovel. He hands the cookie bag to Rocket. Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER, \nOPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE. CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered. Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar makes a motion with his hand. Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest chimp. Then another one. Then another. The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND \nROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE \n.into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks. \nKOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT. They stare at each other. Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM. \nEXT. LAB GROUNDS/GUARD KIOSK - NIGHT \nCaesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on his nightly rounds. They look at each other, lay low. To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED \nSECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE- \nTALKIE. But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight. \nEXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT \nCaesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off together. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT \nCaesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S \nKHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN. Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted. Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep, oblivious. Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him. \nINT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe apes have calmed down. Koba slips back into his cage and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 closes the door. \nCLICK. It locks into place. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING \nDawn of a new day. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CORNELIA'S CAGE - EARLY MORNING \nSunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep. Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING \nCaesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still asleep. There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS. Caesar freezes. Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the shovel. Locks the door behind him. He hasn't seen Caesar yet. \nDODGE Rise and shine, assholes. The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in the common area. \nTHEN DODGE SEES HIM. \nDODGE (CONT'D) What the hell - (seeing Cornelia's open \nCAGE) You sly son of a bitch. How'd you do that? Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds it in front of him. He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage. \nDODGE (CONT'D) We're gonna go slow here, alright? You're gonna go back in your cage, you're not going to give me no trouble. \nThe apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent, riveted, waiting to see what will happen. Cornelia stands, watching. Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is unreadable. Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL \nAGAINST THE BARS. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Back! Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips. Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples, Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT. Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward the orangutan cage. \nDODGE (CONT'D) We're going to have you fixed, Einstein, that's for damn sure... But first we're going to figure out how you pulled this off... \nCAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Go on. Get in that cage. Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther. \nDODGE (CONT'D) I said get! But Caesar doesn't move. Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement floor. He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Get in that cage, you damn dirty ape! \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL \nHEIGHT. \nTHEN HE STARES DODGE FULL IN THE EYES, DIGS DEEP, AND WITH \nFOR GOOD MEASURE, ROCKET GIVES THE BARS A THREATENING SHAKE, \nAND THAT'S WHEN WILL SEES IT: KOBA'S RED WRISTBAND WRAPPED \nAROUND KOBA'S ARM. \nWILL (CONT'D) \n(SHOCKED) Where'd he get that wristband, Caesar? That's Koba's band... \n(REALIZING) Did Koba get out of his cage?? Yelling after Caesar. \nWILL (CONT'D) Caesar wait! But Caesar's not waiting. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY \nCaesar climbs onto the open tailgate of a pick-up truck. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Apes gather around, expectant. \nCAESAR \n(VOICE STRAINING) No. At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall. FROM THE CHIMPANZEE HOUSE Will and Stewart watch, stunned. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) C...Cage! The humans' jaws drop, petrified. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) \nNO CAGE! NO MORE'. \nCAESAR FIERCELY POUNDS HIS CHEST. EXACTLY LIKE ALPHA. \nTHE APES SHRIEK TO HEAVEN. BEAT OF JUNGLE DRUMS as CAESAR BOLTS FROM THE TRUCK BED. \nAPES RACE TO FOLLOW HIM OFF THE RANCH. Will - and the other humans - are blown away. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nThe pack of apes, led by Caesar, emerges from the ranch gate and moves out over the countryside. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY \nANIMAL CONTROL, AMBULANCE, POLICE VEHICLES stream onto the ranch. \nVOICE They could be spread out all over the County by now. Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby. \nWILL No - they'll stick together. \nDODGE \n(INTERRUPTING) They're following one ape. You kill him, you stop them all. \nHUFFS There's a leader? \nDODGE \n(POINTING) Ask him - he raised him. All eyes to Will. \nWILL His name is Caesar. If I can reason with him, I know I can put an end to this. \nHUFFS Reason with him? Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel. \nWILL You don't understand - this chimp is smart - he'll listen to me \nHUFF (to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER) Get on the horn with every agency you can think of! We've got to track down these monkeys before they do major damage! The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge follows. \nDODGE You need me riding with you. I've got experience with these animals. (eye on Will) I can point out the one you want. \nEXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DAY \nAn AMBULANCE pulling away. Two POLICE CARS out front. Jacobs stands talking with a couple of POLICE OFFICERS. \nOFFICER (handing Jacobs a card) If you think of anything else, this is where I can be reached - A RUMBLING SOUND from behind. They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way. Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can. \nA hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG moving in. KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures. A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a bench nearby. The Girl looks up, claps her hands. \nGIRL Monkey! OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then another. And another. \nREVEAL THREE DOZEN APES EMERGING FROM THE FOG, MAKING THEIR \nWAY DOWN THE SLOPE. suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure. \nPEOPLE START TO NOTICE - GRAB THEIR KIDS. The Mother looks up from her book. SOMEONE SCREAMS. \nGIRL (CONT'D) Mommy? The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't get to her. \nMOTHER April! Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up and puts her down out of harm's way. Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where he's going. SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nFog rolls in off the bay. Will's strapped into his seat, looking down at the city below. \nHUFFS You see them? \nWILL No, I can't see - \nSTEWART Oh my god. Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW: it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl - chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along parallel streets... She realizes something. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) I know where they're going. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY \nA SIGN: THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO. FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors. The fun is interrupted by the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS sweeping low overhead. Faces turn skyward... \nA moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos. PEOPLE scatter. SCREAM. Released balloons float lazily upward. \nINT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY \nWill watches Caesar moving the apes down the zoo's pathways, dodging people, jumping over benches. \nWILL He's going to release the apes. Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off - but hesitate. The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY \nAs the apes pass other enclosures, the ANIMALS GO NUTS. Lions ROAR. Giraffes run back and forth. \nINT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO/APE ENCLOSURE - DAY \nWRANGLER What the hell am I supposed to do when they get here?! An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know something's coming. Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers, turns to see Caesar and his apes. Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth. The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys. \nSOUND OF BOLTS AND LOCKS CLICKING OPEN. \nINT./EXT. APE ENCLOSURE/ZOO - DAY \nAll kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from their separate enclosures. Caesar's apes are waiting for them. Caesar makes eye contact with the GRIZZLED OLD MALE CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit. \nBy now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY. Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some News Crews. \nINT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY \nApes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the street. \nDODGE That's him! The one with the white on his shoulder! A SNIPER takes aim at Caesar - the BULLET RICOCHETS OFF THE \nSIDEWALK. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAB - DAY \nJacobs watches a TOW TRUCK pull away with his ruined black Jaguar in tow. He climbs into a waiting taxi. He looks like hell. \nINT. TAXI - DAY \nDODGE IS AMONG THEM. \nAT THE SOUTH END OF THE BRIDGE Caesar and his apes race forward. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nWill and Stewart watch from above as the apes stream Northward, over and around stopped cars. \nHUFFS \n(INTO HEADSET) Tell them to hold their fire until they get past the traffic! WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a place on the bridge where there are no more cars. Then they'll be open season. Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot behind them. \nON THE BRIDGE Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the bridge traffic. Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad cars. He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready. \nHe sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION \nCABLES. Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE. Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and swirls hundreds of feet below. Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing, taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him. Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps. Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into the fog. Rocket's right behind. The remaining apes follow. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nFrom the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army. Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of fog. Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck. And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled traffic. \nBELOW THE BRIDGE Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck apes begin swinging their way toward the.north end. \nABOVE BRIDGE Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top. They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND \nSWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM. A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT. A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH the chimp hits the water. They keep moving. \nON THE BRIDGE The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot. \nDODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND \nLOADS. They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them. BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables. Another chimp falls to its death. Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's practically zero. \nNOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM \nIN THE FOG. \nOFFICER They're all around us! Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH - \nWHOOSH... DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful of some visibility. That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG, \nCLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE. \nWITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK. There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through the fog. He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main cable. ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar. Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES \nCAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL. \nROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR \nUP. Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO \nTHE MAIN CABLE. \nBAM! Rocket's hit in the back! He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE \nBRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH. Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again. But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON \nTHE BRIDGE. The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD \nTHE BARRICADE. Like a freight train of menacing power. Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to back up. A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming. And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade -- MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in. Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable. \nBELOW THE BRIDGE Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle waged above is audible. He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge. \nAERIAL VIEW As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON \nCABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND \nAPES SCAMPERING BELOW. Vanquishing the humans. \nON THE BRIDGE \nWill enters the clearing. He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the CANOPY that Caesar always loved. \nEXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK \nHuffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an \nASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN. \nHUFFS Follow me. Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S \nDIRECTION, GUNS READY. \nSTEWART Hang on a second... (to nearest Officer) Where are they going? \nLooks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles with all her might. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) \nWHERE ARE THEY GOING?! \nEXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK \nQuiet here. Will heads toward the Grove of Trees. \nWILL Caesar! ... He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN \nFRONT OF HIM. \nIT'S KOBA. Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his neck. \nWILL (CONT'D) You. Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will. He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth. Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him away. \nENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST \nSTARES HIM DOWN. \nKOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS. Which leaves just Will and Caesar. \nCAESAR Humans coming. \nWILL No. I'm alone. Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say. \nWILL (CONT'D) I owe you an apology. \nCAESAR Will want Caesar dead. \nWILL I thought you had killed a man. But I should have known better. Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's thinking. \nWILL (CONT'D) I want you to know that all of this is my fault. My responsibility. \n(BEAT) Can you forgive me? BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path. Will realizes he's been betrayed. \nWILL (CONT'D) \n(PANICKED) Wait - no - \nCAESAR Will leave. \nWILL I won't - \nCAESAR Will leave now. \nWILL No. I'm staying with you. Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down. At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing. Huffs takes aim at Caesar. \nWILL (CONT'D) \nNO! \nHE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST \nOF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE. \n", "test1_input": "FRANKLIN Bright Eyes - the mother. That's why she wouldn't let anyone into her cage. Will looks down at the helpless baby. \nWILL I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry - but there's nothing I can do here. He's got to be put down like the others. \nFRANKLIN Tell you what, Doc. (producing a syringe) I'm done for the day. So you be my guest. Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will. It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his little hands. Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's belly... but there's no way he can go through with this. Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who watches from outside the cage. \nWILL Two days. Then you have to figure it out. \nINT. WALMART - NIGHT \nA BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a cart. Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered in a blanket - plastered to his chest. He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array of choices. \nINT. WALMART CHECK OUT - NIGHT \nA TEEN rings up the baby goods. \nTEEN CASHIER Hey man. Congratulations. \nWILL Huh? \n(REALIZING) Oh. Thanks. \nEXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWill pulls up in his truck. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nWill's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens the door. \nIRENA It's Friday night. I had a date. \nWILL I'm sorry - there was - She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the walk, her footfalls pointed and angry. He pauses there. Apparently no end to this bad day. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nWill dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest. He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its contents in the sink. Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE \nVIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND \nROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWill sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED WAIL comes from another part of the house. Will sits up, remembering. \nINT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT \nWill enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick, making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES. \nWill stares down at the little creature, trying to decide what to do. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nWill turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat and sits. \nWILL It's okay. It's going to be okay. Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit. Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The room fills with STEAM. \nCUT TO: A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him. In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF, FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT \nTRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE. Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily intimidates all the chimps around him. \nREVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING \nTHEM ON HIS LAPTOP. Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful in his arms. \nSUPER: \"TWO YEARS LATER\" SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH. \nINT. HOUSE - DAY \nThe chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture. The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in. The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling. As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into... \n", "test1_true": ".the attic. Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT TO THE OUTSIDE. Rings and pegs for climbing are set into the walls. Toys, books and puzzles scattered across the floor. SOUNDS of KIDS PLAYING and LAUGHING OUTSIDE. The chimp heads for the vent and peers through. WE GO OVER \nHIS SHOULDER TO SEE... \nEXT. THE OUTSIDE WORLD - DAY \nFrom up here, the chimp has a commanding view of the entire neighborhood. A group of CHILDREN rides bikes. A MAN mows his lawn. There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls up to the HOUSE NEXT DOOR. HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his WIFE and young DAUGHTER, ALICE, then climbs into the cab with his carry-on suitcase. Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's Taxi disappear around the corner... Then TODD, the big brother, SWIPES THE DOLL FROM HER HAND and rides off on his bike. His FRIENDS LAUGH. The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED TEARS and runs after them. \nWILL (O.S.) Caesar! Breakfast! The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR. \nINT. HOUSE - DAY \nWill comes away from the ladder, heads for the kitchen. The living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games. One of them has been completed. Will considers it, looks around for the box, reads the side... AGES 12 and up. 12 and up. Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table, picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes. Will walks over, sits across from him. \nWILL Please pass the ketchup. Caesar slides the ketchup to Will. \nWILL (CONT'D) Thanks. \nCAESAR (using American Sign \nLANGUAGE) You're welcome. NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there will be subtitles. \nINT. GEN-SYS LAB - DAY \nA MOUSE moves through a maze as a LAB TECH marks its progress. Will - in a lab coat - watches with intensity. The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads. The mouse stops, studies the cone. \nLAB TECH Is he going to turn left or right...? The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement blooming on his face. \nWILL There it is. Restored cognitive function. \nLAB TECH Same success rate as the primates. Congratulations. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY \nVISITORS buy tickets at the entrance gates. Will pulls around to an Employee Parking Lot. \nINT. PRIMATE INFIRMARY, SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY \nDr. Molly Stewart - late 20's, pretty tomboy -- finishes taking Caesar's blood pressure. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 STEWART He's right on target. Height. Weight... She checks Caesar's ears. \nCAESAR Dairy Queen. \nWILL After. Sit still. \nSTEWART What about diet? \nWILL A healthy diet. Fruits, vegetables. \nCAESAR Ice cream. Will ignores him. \nSTEWART What's he saying? \nWILL He's hungry. Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will sends him a look - out it out. \nSTEWART He seems extremely intelligent. How many words does Caesar sign? Beat. \nWILL You know, the basics. \nCAESAR Soft-serve. \nSTEWART I've heard of apes learning up to a hundred and fifty words. Is he good with puzzles? Will hesitates. \nWILL He's pretty good. \nSTEWART Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously happy. You're doing a great job with him. (doesn't want to alarm) But there is an anomaly I noticed. \nWILL Like what? \n", "test1_id": 801, "test2_input": "WILL I was too late. She puts the photo down, cuddles against him. \nSTEWART You tried. You worked really hard. Walter knew that. \nWILL Wasn't good enough though, was it. ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his two teenage sons... \nINT. LAB - NIGHT \nFranklin's on the phone. \nFRANKLIN Just checking in. You didn't show up at work today. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVANS' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCrummy little place. TV's on with no sound. WE HEAR FRANKLIN'S VOICE through the phone machine. \nFRANKLIN (O.S.) Hope you're feeling better - let me know if you need anything. \nREVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried blood across his cheek -- as if draining from his lifeless eye. \nEXT. RANCH - NIGHT \nDeep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds. \nINT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT \nCaesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice grabs his arm. \nMAURICE Where go? \nCAESAR Find Mother. \nEXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT \nCaesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the \nGATE. As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to go with him. Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER. To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S \nEYES HAVE CHANGED. Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE \nUNMISTAKABLY GREEN. Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the wound on his arm, now nearly healed. Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket? Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for anything. \nEXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT \nCaesar and Rocket barrel across the ranch, past the living \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away. \nEXT. NEAR-DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nMiddle of the night, only a few cars. Caesar and Rocket stick to bushes and shadows. They wait for a break in traffic, cross the highway. \nEXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT \nIn the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT \nDark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming. \nSUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS. Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the suburban street. \nINT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON WILL'S SLEEPING FACE. \nCREAK, CREAK... CREAK, CREAK. WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that? \nCREAK, CREAK. . .CREAK, CREAK. It's coming from outside. REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed, moves to the window, looks into the back yard. \nTHE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED. Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see. Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes. \n", "test2_true": "INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRocket's fascinated by photos of Caesar with Will and Walter along the mantle. Caesar emerges from Will's room and makes his way down the hallway. \nINT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nStripped bed, a couple of packed boxes. Caesar stands at the doorway, taking it in. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nFeet pounding the pavement, Caesar and Rocket head away from Will's house. \nEXT. OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT \nGEN-SYS RESEARCH SIGN. The grounds are deserted. A SECURITY GUARD listens to RADIO in the guard kiosk. Caesar and Rocket - eyes on the Security Guard - stop at a spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence. \nEXT. LAB GROUNDS - NIGHT \nCaesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE AIR, head toward the Primate House. \nINT. SECURITY KIOSK - NIGHT \nThe Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two chimpanzees run across the grounds. \nEXT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT \nCaesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW OF AWNING WINDOWS near the roof. Rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall. Then Caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to the window's ledge. Hanging by one arm, he swings himself in through the window. Rocket follows. \nINT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE NIGHT \nFranklin's got the graveyard shift. He's watching a movie on the office computer - doesn't hear anything. \nINT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT \nEerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET drop to the cement floor. Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED FIGURES INSIDE. Caesar walks alongside them, peering into each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces. \nA HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED \nBAND AROUND ITS WRIST. \nIT'S OFFERING AN M&M. Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH \nKOBA. \nHIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY. \nTHE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES \nSOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS. Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE. Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&M from Koba's hand. Koba offers up ANOTHER M&M. But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED \nIDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. \nKOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING \nHIS CAGE. \nROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH. ANGLE ON Caesar. He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the \nDISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE. These chimpanzees are distant, strange. No familiar face. \nNO CONNECTION. Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick, stares back at him. Caesar turns away, crestfallen. \nHe YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB CHIMPS start to SCREAM. \nINT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT \nHEARING THE COMMOTION, Franklin puts down his book, heads... \nINT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT \n", "test2_id": 802, "test3_input": "(LISTENING) Caesar? Dodge fed them breakfast about half an hour ago... He holds up a PAIR OF BINOCULARS, looks toward the atrium and ape houses. Can't see anything wrong. \nMR. LANDON (CONT'D) Let me call you back... He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the kitchen. Opening and closing of cabinets. \nMR. LANDON (CONT'D) Hey Dodge - Stewart just called - WE FOLLOW HIM out of the living-room, into the... \nINT. RANCH/KITCHEN - MORNING \n.kitchen. \nMR. LANDON She said that - \nLandon goes pale. ROCKET AND TWO OTHER CHIMPANZEES ARE \nSTANDING IN THE KITCHEN. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - MORNING \nThe two CHIMPANZEES drag Mr. Landon toward the Ape Houses. Rocket follows, munching cereal from a box of Cheerios. \nIN THE DISTANCE Rodney's visible, being dragged, SCREAMING. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY \nWill's car speeds up to the gate and stops. \nSTEWART \n(ON PHONE) No one's answering. In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch house. From where the car is, nothing out of the ordinary is visible. Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car. \nWILL You go get help. \nSTEWART Not a way in the world. I'm coming with you. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nThey sneak into the back of the ranch house. All is quiet. \nINT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nBut once inside, the level of destruction is immediately visible: Overturned table and chairs, plates smashed, cupboards emptied. \nSTEWART Oh my God... I'm calling 911.. Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window. HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering... DODGE, LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES. \nAND - IN THE ATRIUM - SURROUNDED BY HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS... \n.CAESAR. CLEARLY THE ALPHA MALE. Clearly in control. \nWILL Caesar. Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's trembling. \nSTEWART It's going to take them at least half an hour to get here. He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a couple of stray COOKIES. He has an idea. Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON. \nSTEWART (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nWILL I'm going to kill him. \nSTEWART \n(HORRIFIED) Caesar? \nWILL He's dangerous. \nSTEWART You're wrong - he can't have been the one who killed that man - \nWILL There is no other explanation. A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart turns. Now there's another. They're surrounded. She SCREAMS. Will barricades the back door with a table. Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in. \nGLASS SHATTERS. Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door \nCRASHES OFF ITS HINGES - REVEALING BUCK. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY \n", "test3_true": "WILL (CONT'D) Caesar! \nDODGE Welcome to the mad house. \nSTEWART I called Animal Control - they'll be here soon - \nWILL (through the bars) I just want to talk to you! \nDODGE Well this'll be interesting because your freak'll talk back. \nRODNEY Dodge thinks he spoke to him. \nDODGE He did! He said the word \"no\" - right to my face. \nWILL What do you mean? \nDODGE He can talk. \nSTEWART That's impossible. \nDODGE Then he must have a voicebox in his ass, because I heard him! Caesar walks up. Will steels himself, feels in his pocket - the POISONED COOKIE is ready. \nWILL Caesar - people are coming. People with guns. You've got to make the apes go back in their cages. \nCAESAR \n(SIGNING) Apes no belong in cage. Human put apes in cage. Will's heart sinks as he sees that Caesar is intransigent. He means what he's saying. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) \n(SIGNING) Never again. Will takes a moment, DIGS DEEP TO MAKE HIMSELF DO WHAT MUST \nBE DONE. Finally he brings the POISONED COOKIE from his pocket, holds it out. \nWILL I brought this for you. Caesar eyes the cookie but doesn't take it. \nWILL (CONT'D) (it's killing him) Don't you want it? \nCAESAR \n(SIGNING) Never. They look at each other. Two creatures once so close, but now with a vast chasm between them. \nWILL You went to the lab last night. I know it was you. Caesar doesn't deny it. \nWILL (CONT'D) (emotion spilling over) How could you kill that man, Caesar? Once you kill you can't it back - that man's gone forever. \nWILL SEES A GENUINE LOOK OF BEWILDERMENT CROSS CAESAR'S FACE. \nIt gives him pause. \nCAESAR \n(SIGNING) Caesar no kill. \nWILL But... \nCAESAR \n(SIGNING) Caesar no kill! Caesar SLAPS the COOKIE from Will's hand. Rocket immediately comes over to stand by Caesar, but Caesar doesn't want to fight. He's done - disgusted - with Will. He turns, begins to walk off. \nWILL Don't walk away. We need to talk. \nCORNELIA FALLS IN STEP WITH CAESAR, BUT PAUSES TO SNIFF AT \nTHE COOKIE ON THE GROUND. \nWILL (CONT'D) Don't - ! \nTOO LATE - SHE GOBBLES IT UP. \n", "test3_id": 803}

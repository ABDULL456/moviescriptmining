{"test1_input": "CAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE. \nDODGE Caesar. Hey. I can get you out. Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING. \nDODGE (CONT'D) This way. \nCaesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight. Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car. He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into... \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY \n.the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks. This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES. Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND \nTHEIR CAGES. \nDODGE Caesar - over here. Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE \nREALIZES IT'S A DEAD END. He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT. \nCAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Stupid monkey. \nFOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS \nTHE BETRAYAL. Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to the ceiling, searching for a way out. To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right: \nTHREE MORE CHIMPANZEES. Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW THE SCREAM as it spreads out over the property... \nEXT. MOVING CAR - DAY \n.and finds the Will's car, driving down the winding road, away from the Ranch. \nINT. MOVING CAR - DAY \nWill keeps driving, TEARS streaming down his face. \nINT. CAESAR'S CAGE -- LATER \nTime has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon. Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the cage, heavy head resting on his arms. He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE, followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up. In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR \nCHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD \nACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN. This is ROCKET. He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL. He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a challenging eye to Caesar. \nSCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM! A terrifying display of power and dominance. \nDODGE (O.S.) Okay, assholes. Dinner time. Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening look to Caesar - moves off. Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out. Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in an occasional rotted vegetable. The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet- looking dog food. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow. Bet you don't get none of that in the suburbs. Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Think that's funny? That funny to you, you hairy prick? Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER. \nRODNEY Look at that! Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage. \nDODGE One thing you can count on: Long as there are humans on this earth, you'll always be a monkey in a cage. The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards. Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his back as a shield. The water BLAST is relentless. Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the floor. \nRODNEY What about his clothes? Might cause problems with the other apes. \nDODGE Leave 'em. \nEXT. BACK YARD - DAY \nWalter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's swing set. Empty. Useless in the back yard. The Aide stands nearby, sending a text message. \nINT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY \nWill looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on the sofa, surrounded by reminders of Caesar - puzzles, games, etc. The newspaper's unread beside him. \nWALTER (O.S.) John? Walter enters, looks at Will. \nWALTER (CONT'D) John - where's Caesar? The old man looks stricken. \n", "test1_true": "INT. LAB CAFETERIA - DAY \nWE FOLLOW Will as he strides purposefully into the cafeteria. He's shaved, pulled himself together. Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner. He heads for him. Jacobs looks up, sees will coming. Will slides into the seat across from him. \nJACOBS You've been gone a week. \nWILL I was sick. \nJACOBS Too sick to return my calls? You know it was a funny thing, but I was watching the news and they started talking about a seven-year- old chimpanzee that went nuts - and all of a sudden, there you were on the TV. A seven year old chimp, raised since birth. The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his voice. Neither man cares. \nWILL He's the son of chimp 4. And he's smart. Off-the-charts smart. Because of the 112. The genetic therapy was passed in utero - from the mother to the son. Without a single negative side-effect. \nJACOBS Aside from biting off a man's finger. \nWILL He was protecting my father. The same way his mother was protecting him. \nJACOBS We've had this conversation already. We knew the 112 was making the apes smart - \nWILL \n(INTERRUPTING) I tried the 112 on my father. A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the effect Will was after. \nWILL (CONT'D) I had a sample vial. \nJACOBS You're out of your mind. Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious. \nWILL Don't you want to know if it worked? Jacobs can't resist... \nJACOBS Did it? \nWILL It was miraculous. Unquestionable adult neurogenesis - development of fresh nerve tissue. \n(BEAT) It brought my father back. But Jacobs is confused. \nJACOBS You told me he was failing. \nWILL It's just like with the mice. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, you need to keep it at bay \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 - you need boosters. \nWill can see Jacobs turning this over in his mind - the possibilities. The money. \nJACOBS Why have you waited so long to tell me this? \nWILL I couldn't risk losing him. \nJACOBS 'Him'? \nWILL Caesar. \nJACOBS The ape? Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity. \nWILL We've discovered a safe treatment. It's the payday you've been waiting for. I'll recreate the primate version of 112 for you. \n(BEAT) But only under one condition. It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged. \nJACOBS You're giving me conditions? I could have you arrested for what you've done. \nWILL But you won't - you need me to build the drug. Here's what I need: I want you to get Caesar back. \nJACOBS \n(THROWN) How the hell can I do that? \nWILL However they do things in your part of the world. Get attorneys into it. Write checks. Slip cash into the right pockets. (pausing for emphasis) Make it happen. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CAESAR'S CAGE - MORNING \nEarly morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage. He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages are empty - that his cage door is open. Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING \n", "test1_id": 801, "test2_input": ".into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks. \nKOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT. They stare at each other. Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM. \nEXT. LAB GROUNDS/GUARD KIOSK - NIGHT \nCaesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on his nightly rounds. They look at each other, lay low. To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED \nSECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE- \nTALKIE. But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight. \nEXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT \nCaesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off together. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT \nCaesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S \nKHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN. Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted. Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep, oblivious. Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him. \nINT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe apes have calmed down. Koba slips back into his cage and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 closes the door. \nCLICK. It locks into place. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING \nDawn of a new day. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CORNELIA'S CAGE - EARLY MORNING \nSunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep. Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage. \nINT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING \nCaesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still asleep. There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS. Caesar freezes. Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the shovel. Locks the door behind him. He hasn't seen Caesar yet. \nDODGE Rise and shine, assholes. The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in the common area. \nTHEN DODGE SEES HIM. \nDODGE (CONT'D) What the hell - (seeing Cornelia's open \nCAGE) You sly son of a bitch. How'd you do that? Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds it in front of him. He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage. \nDODGE (CONT'D) We're gonna go slow here, alright? You're gonna go back in your cage, you're not going to give me no trouble. \nThe apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent, riveted, waiting to see what will happen. Cornelia stands, watching. Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is unreadable. Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL \nAGAINST THE BARS. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Back! Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips. Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples, Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT. Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward the orangutan cage. \nDODGE (CONT'D) We're going to have you fixed, Einstein, that's for damn sure... But first we're going to figure out how you pulled this off... \nCAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Go on. Get in that cage. Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther. \nDODGE (CONT'D) I said get! But Caesar doesn't move. Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement floor. He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage. \nDODGE (CONT'D) Get in that cage, you damn dirty ape! \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL \nHEIGHT. \nTHEN HE STARES DODGE FULL IN THE EYES, DIGS DEEP, AND WITH \n", "test2_true": "CAESAR (with his voice) No! \nSTUNNED SILENCE. \nTHE WORLD STOPS SPINNING. Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance. Caesar has spoken. Actually uttered a word. Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded, trying to comprehend what has just happened. And then... they go nuts. \nSCREAMING. YELLING. JUMPING UP AND DOWN. That's when Caesar attacks. He rushes Dodge, wrestling the shovel from his hands. Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN \nTHE SIDE OF THE HEAD. Dodge staggers back. Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach. Dodge crumples forward. \nCAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD. Lights out. Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door. Rocket helps pull him inside. \nTHEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE \nAPES COME STREAMING OUT. They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS \nAND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM. Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE \nSCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO \nHANDS TOGETHER. \nHe moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices the palm and places his hand against it. Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall, beats his chest and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND. And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR \nOPEN PALMS WAITING. \nINT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nWill wakes, climbs out of bed, careful not to wake Stewart. \nINT. HALLWAY - MORNING \nHe moves down the hallway, approaching Walter's room. He pauses, puzzled, at the door - which is AJAR. Strange. \nTHE PHONE STARTS TO RING. Will ignores it -- slowly pushes the door open... AND SEES \nCAESAR'S TATTERED PANTS LAID ACROSS THE STRIPPED BED. He stands there, stunned. \nJACOBS (O.S.) Will? Hello? Will pick up the goddamned phone! \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nWILL Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH JACOBS AT THE LAB. \nJACOBS The animal handler - Franklin - was killed last night. In the primate house. \nWILL Franklin's dead? \nJACOBS Something very powerful broke his neck. Snapped it in two. \nWILL Could it have been one of our chimps? \nJACOBS All our apes are accounted for - \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 secured in their cages. But here's the kicker: One of our security guards swears he chased a chimpanzee off the grounds last night. Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's swing. \nJACOBS (CONT'D) Where in the hell did that chimp come from?! \nEXT. WILL'S HOUSE -- MORNING \nWill speeds out of the driveway, Stewart by his side. She's dialing her cell phone. \nINT. RANCH HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nMr. Landon answers the RINGING PHONE. He's in his pajamas. \nMR. LANDON The Ranch. Landon speaking. \n(LISTENING) Hey Stewart. \n", "test2_id": 802, "test3_input": "FOR GOOD MEASURE, ROCKET GIVES THE BARS A THREATENING SHAKE, \nAND THAT'S WHEN WILL SEES IT: KOBA'S RED WRISTBAND WRAPPED \nAROUND KOBA'S ARM. \nWILL (CONT'D) \n(SHOCKED) Where'd he get that wristband, Caesar? That's Koba's band... \n(REALIZING) Did Koba get out of his cage?? Yelling after Caesar. \nWILL (CONT'D) Caesar wait! But Caesar's not waiting. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY \nCaesar climbs onto the open tailgate of a pick-up truck. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Apes gather around, expectant. \nCAESAR \n(VOICE STRAINING) No. At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall. FROM THE CHIMPANZEE HOUSE Will and Stewart watch, stunned. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) C...Cage! The humans' jaws drop, petrified. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) \nNO CAGE! NO MORE'. \nCAESAR FIERCELY POUNDS HIS CHEST. EXACTLY LIKE ALPHA. \nTHE APES SHRIEK TO HEAVEN. BEAT OF JUNGLE DRUMS as CAESAR BOLTS FROM THE TRUCK BED. \nAPES RACE TO FOLLOW HIM OFF THE RANCH. Will - and the other humans - are blown away. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nThe pack of apes, led by Caesar, emerges from the ranch gate and moves out over the countryside. \nEXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY \nANIMAL CONTROL, AMBULANCE, POLICE VEHICLES stream onto the ranch. \nVOICE They could be spread out all over the County by now. Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby. \nWILL No - they'll stick together. \nDODGE \n(INTERRUPTING) They're following one ape. You kill him, you stop them all. \nHUFFS There's a leader? \nDODGE \n(POINTING) Ask him - he raised him. All eyes to Will. \nWILL His name is Caesar. If I can reason with him, I know I can put an end to this. \nHUFFS Reason with him? Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel. \nWILL You don't understand - this chimp is smart - he'll listen to me \nHUFF (to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER) Get on the horn with every agency you can think of! We've got to track down these monkeys before they do major damage! The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge follows. \nDODGE You need me riding with you. I've got experience with these animals. (eye on Will) I can point out the one you want. \nEXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DAY \nAn AMBULANCE pulling away. Two POLICE CARS out front. Jacobs stands talking with a couple of POLICE OFFICERS. \nOFFICER (handing Jacobs a card) If you think of anything else, this is where I can be reached - A RUMBLING SOUND from behind. They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way. Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can. \n", "test3_true": "INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY \nCaesar and his chimps BURST THROUGH THE DOOR. No time is wasted. Cages are opened, LAB CHIMPS liberated. Koba steps from his cage slowly, measuring the situation as apes around him go crazy. \nEXT. LAB - DAY \nA stunned officer gets to his squad car walkie-talkie. \nOFFICER We have a situation at Gen-Sys Laboratory!

LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE/TREATMENT ROOMS- DAY \nANARCHY OF MOVEMENT, BLURS of BLACK FUR running amok through white rooms, tearing everything up. EMPLOYEES SCATTER - running for the exits. Some duck behind desks. \nANGLE ON REFRIGERATED CANISTERS OF 113. Like everything else in the lab, torn down, stomped on, thrown against the wall. Caesar and Buck walk through the lab, eyeing the destruction. \nEXT. LAB - DAY \nJacobs, a Security Guard and the two Officers are huddled behind a squad car. Other Employees are hiding and watching from the safety of the parking lot. They suddenly realize that everything has GONE SILENT.

They duck as the apes run by - some of them right up and over the car they're crouched behind. BAM! BAM! BAM! as the chimp's hit and leapfrog over the squad car - and their heads. The apes stampede across the parking lot, where several use Jacobs' BLACK JAGUAR to VAULT OVER THE FENCE. The last is BUCK, whose weight CRUSHES the car. And then they're gone. Every last one of them. Quiet now, except for CAR ALARMS. \nINT. LAB - DAY \nJacobs enters the lab. In front of him is utter silence and devastation. Like the morning after a huge, destructive party. Out of the quiet there's the PADDING SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON \nBROKEN GLASS. Jacobs freezes. KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at each other for a long moment. Then Koba calmly walks past him. \nOnce outside Koba GALLOPS OFF. Jacobs can see him through the open doorway disappearing in the direction of the others Jacobs takes a stumbling step backwards, KICKING SOMETHING \nTHAT GOES LOUDLY ROLLING ALONG THE CEMENT FLOOR. \nIT'S A CRUMPLED CANISTER OF ADENOVIRUS 113.

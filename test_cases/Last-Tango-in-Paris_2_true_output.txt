She SMILES. 
JEANNE He touched me, but the way he did it. 
PAUL Aha! The way he did it. OK, what did he do? 
JEANNE Behind the house, there were two trees. A plane tree and a chestnut. I sat under the plane tree and he sat under the chestnut. And one, two, three... We each began to masturbate. The first who came... won! 
Paul is suddenly LOST IN HIS THOUGHTS. He wanders to the wall, leans on it and studies his harmonica. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Why aren't you listening to me? 
PAUL When did you first come? How old were you? 
JEANNE The first time? I was really late for school. I started running and it was downhill. All of a sudden, I felt a strong sensation here. So I ran and ran and I came as I ran. The faster I ran, the better it was and the more I came. A couple of days later, I tried to do it again, but no luck. 
Paul climbs a TRIPOD that is leaning against the wall. JEANNE (CONT'D) Why aren't you listening to me? 
He takes the PIN OUT and it comes apart. He FALLS BACK. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Why do I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall when I talk to you? Your solitude weighs on me. It isn't indulgent. It isn't generous. You are selfish! 
He finally looks at her. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) I can be by myself, too, you know! 
DRUM MUSIC STARTS AS... 
He smiles, twirls a drum stick, puts his harmonica on her head and goes into the NEXT ROOM. 
She THROWS THE HARMONICA on the floor in disgust. 
As he FIDDLE FARTS around the apartment, Jeanne MASTURBATES. 
DINING ROOM 
Paul is REUNITED with his SMALL LAMP SHADE. He puts it over his face and CRIES into it. 
LIVING ROOM 
Jeanne has CUM. She ROLLS OFF THE MATTRESSES onto the floor, SPENT. 
She ROCKS BACK AND FORTH on her haunches. 
A SIREN screams outside. She hugs the wall. 
DINING ROOM 
Paul is LOST IN GRIEF, crying harder. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL - LOBBY 
SAX MUSIC PLAYS - from a room in the HOTEL. 
It's soothing and nice. Nevertheless, Rosa's mother roams the room, sleepless, a CROCHET BLANKET wrapped around her. Paul sleeps on the couch. She covers him with a the blanket, MATERNAL. 
He THROWS IT on the floor. 
ROSA'S MOTHER I can't sleep with this music. 
PAUL I came to this hotel a long time ago, to spend one night. And I stayed for five years. 
ROSA'S MOTHER When Papa and I had the hotel, people came here to sleep. 
PAUL Now, there's all sorts. They can hide, take drugs, play music. 
Rosa's mother reaches out and strokes Paul's arm. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Take your hand away. 
She continues stroking. 
ROSA'S MOTHER You're not alone, Paul. I'm here. 
He sits up calmly, taking her hand in his own, then... BITES HER!!! 
She PULLS HER HAND BACK in obvious pain.

HANNAH No way! Not with all that happening... 
She motions casually at his abs. 
HANNAH So... do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom? 
JACOB (AMUSED) In the bedroom is preferable. 
Hannah stands, a girl on a mission. 
(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: (4) 66 HANNAH Good. Let's go there. 
67 INT. BAR 67 
Meanwhile Cal, beaten up and soaking wet from the rain, ENTERS. He looks to his usual table, in need of a friend's company. 
But Jacob isn't there. 
CUT BACK TO: 
68 INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 68 
Hannah lies on her back in the dim light. Jacob is on top of her, shirtless. They're making out, gently. 
HANNAH (TIPSY) This pillow is amazing. It forms perfectly to the shape of my head. 
JACOB I'm glad you like it. 
They resume kissing. After a beat, she pulls back again. 
HANNAH Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone? 
Off his look... 
HANNAH They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course! 
She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself. 
HANNAH Sorry, let's proceed. 
Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again. 
HANNAH You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you? 
(CONTINUED) 68 CONTINUED: 68 JACOB (LYING) No. 
HANNAH Oh. My. God! You totally do! 
JACOB (ADMITTING) I do. 
She STARTS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. It's infectious. 
HANNAH How much did it cost? 
JACOB Five thousand doll-- 
That DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing with her... really laughing. We can tell: this is different for him. He likes her. 
We watch him as he realizes that. As he processes it. We watch him look at Hannah. 
ON HANNAH 
Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing. And then... Jacob does the most unexpected thing: 
JACOB Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself. 
HANNAH What? No! I don't want to know anything about you. 
JACOB C'mon, one question. 
HANNAH Okay, fine, but then we bang. 
JACOB Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or past GIRLFRIENDS -- 
HANNAH What's your mom like? 
(CONTINUED) 68 CONTINUED: (2) 68 The question takes him by surprise. He hesitates, then: 
JACOB Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold. 
HANNAH And your father? 
JACOB He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I have... 
He motions at his PILLOW. 
JACOB Stuff like this. 
She motions at his abs.

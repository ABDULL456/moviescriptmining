{"train": "PAUL I was put here. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR In the coffin? \nPAUL Yes. Please send help. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR And you're saying the coffin is buried? \nPAUL I think so. It's...it's hot in here. I can't breathe. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR Do you know your location, sir? \nPAUL I told you, I don't know. Somewhere in Iraq. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR Iraq? \nPAUL Yes. I'm a truck driver, an American. I work for CRT. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR Are you a soldier, sir? \nPAUL No. Please, please listen to me. I'm a truck driver. I work for CRT. I'm a civilian contractor working in Iraq. We were attacked in Baqubah, they...they... \n(STARTS CRYING) ...shot them. All of them. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR They shot who, sir? \nPAUL All of the other drivers. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR And you're saying this happened in Iraq? The country? \nPAUL Yes. Please, you have to help me. They gave me a safety number to call, but I had it stored in my wallet and -- \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR Mister Conroy, this is 911 emergency in Youngstown, Ohio. \nPAUL Ohio? \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR Yes, sir. I'm not sure exactly how you called here if you're in another country, but if you'd like, I can patch you through to the Sheriff's Department. \nPAUL Sheriff's Department? No...you don't underst... \n(GIVING UP) ...forget it. Realizing that his conversation is both lengthy and useless, Paul ends the call. He checks the battery life on the phone. It still holds steady at two bars. He immediately dials another number, one that he can recall with ease. He again enters the 001 international code before making the call. Paul then dials his home phone. It rings several times, so far unanswered. \nPAUL Come on, come on. Pick up. Please. After sitting through the agony of a few more rings, Paul is met with the answering machine. \nPAUL Hello? Is this the F.B.I.? \nSPECIAL AGENT HARRIS Yes it is, sir. \nPAUL I'm calling from Iraq. I'm buried in the desert somewhere. I need you to help me -- \nSPECIAL AGENT HARRIS Whoa, whoa, sir. Slow down. When were you in Iraq? \nPAUL Now. I'm there now. I'm a truck driver for CRT. I've been here for nine months. \nSPECIAL AGENT HARRIS May I have your name please, sir? \nPAUL Paul Conroy. \nSPECIAL AGENT HARRIS (saying it as he writes it \nDOWN) Paul Conroy. (back on the phone) Okay, Paul, explain to me what's going on. \nPaul attempts to center himself so that he can accurately tell his story. \nPAUL Alright. Me and a convoy of other drivers were delivering kitchen parts to a community center. As we got closer, a bunch of kids started throwing rocks at our trucks. Then an IED went off up ahead and blew up one of the other trucks. These guys came out from behind the houses with guns and started shooting everybody right there on the street. \nSPECIAL AGENT HARRIS Were you shot at? \nPAUL I don't know! (after a breath, calmer) I don't know. I was way in the back of the convoy. I must have got hit in the head with one of the rocks and got knocked out. That's the last thing I remember. But now I just woke up, and I was tied up and buried in a coffin. \nSPECIAL AGENT HARRIS Who put you there? \nPAUL I guess whoever ambushed us. \nSpecial Agent Harris sounds slightly skeptical of Paul's claims. \nSPECIAL AGENT HARRIS A bunch of kids? \nPAUL No, you're not listening. The kids threw the rocks at us, but then some Iraqi guys -- maybe insurgents, I don't fucking know -- popped out of nowhere and started shooting at us. \nSPECIAL AGENT HARRIS I thought you said they didn't shoot at you. \nPAUL They didn't, I don't know! But they shot them! \nSPECIAL AGENT HARRIS Sir, you're going to have to stop shouting if -- \nPAUL I'm shouting because you're not listening! I need you to help me! Please!! \nCRT OPERATOR Director of Personnel. Please hold. \nPAUL Personnel? No, I need to talk -- Paul is placed on hold. Synthesized soft rock plays in the background of the phone, maddening Paul further. Over the music, a CRT SPOKESMAN is heard, speaking a recorded testimonial during the on-hold message. \nCRT SPOKESMAN At CRT, we work with our clients to provide effective and sustainable solutions to the challenges they face in our fast-growing, global economy. As the premiere... \nThe message is interrupted by ALAN DAVENPORT's outgoing voice message. \nALAN DAVENPORT You've reached Alan Davenport, personnel director at Crestin, Roland and Thomas. Please leave your name and number at the tone and I will return your call as soon as possible. The BEEP sounds. Paul is confused as to why he was patched through to someone in human resources, but leaves a message nevertheless. \nPAUL This is Paul Conroy, I'm from Hastings, Michigan. I'm a driver for CRT, and my convoy was ambushed...by insurgents or terrorists. I don't know. I don't know who it was. I'm stuck in the ground, buried in a coffin and I need help. Please send help. I'm begging you. I think I'm in Baqubah in the Diyala Provence. Please send help right away. I can't breathe in here. I can't...please. I'm begging you. I don't know who else to call. \nI... \nPaul notices that his phone has again lost signal. \nPAUL (CONT'D) \n(EXASPERATED) ...fuck. Paul drops the phone to his side, the screen still emitting its glow. He explodes with a mixture of rage and fear. He screams and flails his feet and hands wildly, banging them against the walls of the coffin. His animalistic outburst causes the phone to close. The coffin returns to pitch black. After a long beat, Paul lights the Zippo, which remains wedged in the sand compacted against the small hole in the wall of the coffin. \nPaul takes a few moments to catch his breath. He looks again at the cell phone. Remembers receiving a Text Message. The icon on the phone's display indicates that he does, in fact, have an unread Text Message waiting for him. Paul quickly scrolls through the phone's menu, which is all written in Arabic, until he reaches what appears to be the Text Message option. Opening it, he sees a series of ten numbers. Using his click-up pencil, he scribbles the numbers onto the top of the coffin. Next to the number, he writes the word \"HELP?\" Noticing that his phone has again picked-up a signal, he dials the number. \nIt rings once, but then the reception begins to falter. After only two rings, the call is ended. Paul's frustration mounts. He is barely able to fight off another fit of hysterics. He dials the number again. It rings once. A second ring. In the middle of the third ring, someone answers -- but they do not say anything. \nPAUL Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? After a beat, Paul hears breathing on the other end of the phone. He also hears a discordance of background sound; the din of a room filled with Arabic-speaking men. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Hello? Who are you? Please, you have to help me. Still, Paul's words are only met with slow, measured breaths. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Who is this? Hello? The person on the other end eventually speaks. An Iraqi man, JABIR, talks forcefully and aggressively in broken English. \nJABIR Breathe no breathe, American? Ah? Breathe no breathe? \nPAUL What? I don't know what you're saying. Who is this? \nJABIR American can breathe no breathe? \nPAUL No, I can't breathe. Please get me out of here. \nJABIR Get out? \nPAUL Yes, please get me out. Help me. \nJABIR Soldier. \nINT. COFFIN - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Zippo lights. Paul holds it in his hand, using it to illuminate the inside of the coffin. He attempts to push it into its now customary resting place, but the sand has loosened, making it difficult for the Zippo to stay in place. It almost falls to the floor. \nLooking around, Paul sees there is a crack between two planks, located on the opposite wall of the coffin. He wedges the lit Zippo into the crack. With his hands now free, Paul haphazardly positions himself so that his back is facing the top of the coffin. His every move is arduous; the claustrophobic nature of the coffin bearing down on him. Paul positions his bent knees underneath his chest, with his shins and feet pressed against the bottom of the coffin. Using the strength of his legs, he attempts to lift the top off the coffin with his back. Trickles of sand fall in from the side of the coffin, sprinkling against the wooden base. \nHe fails, only to immediately try again. And again. And again. Exhaustion sets in. Staring ahead, the phone sits in front of him. He notices that the battery life bars are still at one solid and one blinking. He grabs the cell phone, staring at it, trying to think of someone else to call. The battery life is limited. Every call has to count. He tries to remember some phone numbers, but has trouble recalling the information. \nPAUL \n(TO HIMSELF) Come on, what's her number? \nHe cannot remember the number he's thinking of. He notices that the flame of the Zippo flickers, indicating its use of his much-needed oxygen. Paul closes the lid, extinguishing the flame. A second later, we see him, lit by the cell phone display screen. He dials the international code for the United States, followed by 411 information. A MALE 411 OPERATOR answers. \nMALE 411 OPERATOR What city and listing, please? \nPAUL Hastings, Michigan. I'm looking for Donna Mitchell. \nMALE 411 OPERATOR I have two Donna Mitchells, sir. One on Federal Road and one on Ardmore Avenue. \nPAUL Ardmore Avenue...I think. Yeah. Shit, I don't know. Just give me that one. \nMALE 411 OPERATOR Ardmore Avenue? \nPAUL Yes, Ardmore Avenue. \nMALE 411 OPERATOR Please hold for your number. Paul is switched to an AUTOMATED MESSAGE. \nAUTOMATED MESSAGE The number you requested, 269-948- 1998 can automatically be dialed for a charge of twenty-five cents by pressing the number one. Paul writes Donna's number and name on the top of the coffin and then presses the number one. He is connected. Her phone rings and rings. Paul's frustration is evident. \nPAUL Come on! Where the hell is everyone? \nThe phone rings some more. Paul checks the battery life -- still at one and a half bars. DONNA eventually answers. \nDONNA Hello? Hearing her voice, Paul hurriedly places the phone to his ear. \nPAUL Donna, it's Paul. \nDONNA Hey, how's it going? \nPAUL Where's Linda? She's not answering her phone. I need to talk to her, I've been taken hostage by... Donna interrupts. We realize, as does Paul, that her voice was actually coming from her answering machine. \nDONNA \nDONNA What? It takes every ounce of Paul's being to keep himself from going off the deep end. He takes a beat to compose himself and then finally offers a very delicate and deliberate response. \nPAUL Donna, I'm very sorry I yelled. But, I'm only going to ask you once more to get me this number. If you don't get me this number, I'm going to die. \nDONNA What? \nPAUL I don't have time to explain. Please...the number. \nDONNA \n(BEAT) Hold on. We hear Donna put down the phone. In the b.g., we hear the sound of keys being pressed on a computer keyboard. After a beat, she picks the phone back up. \nDONNA (CONT'D) Okay...State Department. It's 202- \nPAUL \nDONNA Yeah. Paul writes the number on the top of the coffin, beneath the man others. He writes the initials \"S.D.\" next to it. \nDONNA What the hell's going -- Paul hangs up on Donna mid-sentence. He dials the number the State Department right away. A STATE DEPARTMENT REP answers after a few rings. \nSTATE DEPARTMENT REP United States Department of State. \nPAUL I'm an American citizen, working in Iraq. I've been taken hostage. I need to speak to someone right away. \nSTATE DEPARTMENT REP Where are you calling from, sir? \nPAUL From Iraq. I'm a truck driver for CRT -- Crestin, Roland and Thomas. We were attacked and now I'm being held for ransom. \nSTATE DEPARTMENT REP Are the kidnappers with you? \nPAUL No. I'm buried somewhere. \nSTATE DEPARTMENT REP You're buried? \nPAUL Yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box. It's an old coffin, I think. \nSTATE DEPARTMENT REP Did you try contacting the military out there? \nPAUL I don't have the number. \nSTATE DEPARTMENT REP What number? \nPAUL I was given a number to call, a safety number. But the people took it. \nREBECCA No, I'm covering yours. Everyone who needs to know about this does. \nPAUL You don't go looking for something if you don't know it's missing. \nREBECCA That's why you need to contact Dan Brenner right away. Paul still contemplates contacting the news, but soon acquiesces to Rebecca's pleas for him not to. \nPAUL Fine. \nREBECCA I'm transferring you now. \nRebecca's gone. Paul waits. Several beeps sound as he's being transferred. Paul hears a faint sound coming from behind him, outside the coffin. While the beeps continue to sound, he lights the Zippo, circumspectly looking behind him. He doesn't see anything. With the Zippo still lit, Paul takes a deep, centering breath, followed by another. A few more long beeps pass before a ring is heard. After two rings, DAN BRENNER answers. \nDAN Brenner. \nPAUL Dan Brenner? \nDan is quick to figure out who it is that must be calling him. \nDAN Is this Paul Conroy? \nPAUL \n(EXCITED) Yes, yes it's me. It's Paul. \nDAN Paul, I was informed of what's going on. I want you to know that we're already working on trying to get you out of there. \nPaul is relieved. His first glint of hope has appeared. Tears of joy instantly escape his eyes. \nPAUL Oh, thank you, God. \nDAN I was told that we have until 9pm. Is that right? \nPAUL That's what he said. \nDAN Alright. That doesn't give us a whole lot of time. And just so I have this right, the kidnappers buried you in the ground? \nPAUL Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin. \nDAN Okay. My guess is that since you're able to get a cell signal, you're no more than a few feet underground. \nPAUL I don't know. Maybe. \nDAN What about battery life? How much does the phone have left? Paul looks at the display to find out. \nDAN The kidnapper? \nPAUL Yeah. What do I do? \nDAN You know his number? \nPAUL Yeah. \nDAN Give it to me. \nPAUL What about the call? \nDAN Give me the number first. The phone has rung several times. Paul fears that Jabir may hang up. \nPAUL He's going to hang up. \nDAN Take the call. \nPAUL \nBUT -- \nDAN Take the call. Now. Paul complies with Dan's demand and switches to the other line. \nPAUL Hello. \nJABIR Two hour, six minute. Paul looks at his watch. Indeed, he has but two hours and six minutes until the time reaches 9pm. \nPAUL You have to give me more time. \nJABIR You talk to embassy? They give money? \nPAUL Yes. No. I talked to...someone. Government. They said that they won't pay the money. \nJABIR No pay? \nPAUL No. They said that they don't negotiate with terrorists. \nJABIR Terrorists? I am terrorist? \nPAUL Yes. You are terrorist, you son of a bitch. \nJABIR You are terrified, so I am terrorist? \nJABIR (after a beat) One million money. Jabir hangs up, ending the call. Paul sits motionless for a moment, soaking in all that Jabir has just told him. He again looks down toward his feet. He can see the protruding corner of the metal box, but it's positioned in such a way that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach it. Paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet, but after several unsuccessful attempts, he realizes that a new strategy is necessary. \nHe makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin, so that his head and feet will ultimately switch places. He struggles, inch by troubled inch, to make this maneuver. Sweat pours down the side of his face. The extremely tight quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly impossible. After expending a great deal of energy doing so, Paul eventually completes the turn of his body. He examines the small, rusted metal box. On it is a cartoon picture of a small Arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball. Skeptical at first, Paul carefully examines the box and shakes it gently. Items are heard rummaging inside. He carefully opens it. A fluorescent green light shines from inside. Paul looks inside and finds a lit, green glow stick, fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the coffin. He closes the lid of the Zippo. Removes the stick. Looking into the small box again, he finds several other items: a small, disused flashlight; a second, unlit glow stick; a jackknife; and lastly, a folded piece of paper. He slowly unfolds the piece of paper. We see that his ransom message is written in an unintelligible mix of English and Arabic. Paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust. He crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it to his side. He covers his face with his hands, his labored breaths echoing in his palms. \nUnder the low-light of the green glow stick, Paul picks up the phone and dials his home. Per usual, he gets the answering machine. His son, Shane, is heard on outgoing message. \nSHANE Thanks for calling the Conroy's. We're not home right now. Please leave a message at the beep. Thanks. Paul's eyes well up with tears. He smiles at the sound of his son's voice. The Beep is heard. Paul hangs up without leaving a message. He looks at the time. It's 7:02pm. Battery life is holding steady at one and a half bars. He remembers something. \nPAUL Shit. Paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the phone that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible tone. The glow stick begins to slowly fade. Paul dials Dan Brenner. After a few rings, Dan answers. \nDAN Paul? \nPAUL Here's his number... \nPaul presses the green key, bringing up the last numbers dialed and received. \nDAN Hold on. Alright, go ahead. \nPAUL It's 07902-24-921. Dan says something to someone who is in the room with him, and then returns his attention to Paul. \nDAN This is huge. Unless they're using a cloned line, we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes. \nPAUL What about me? Can you track my cell signal? \nDAN We're having a lot of trouble with yours. Seems to be an EDS line, probably through one of the Egyptian carriers. \nPAUL What does that mean? \nDAN That...it's not going to be easy. \nPAUL He wants me to make a ransom video. \nDAN No. Hold off for as long as you can. \nPAUL If it's going to get me out of here, I'm making it. \nDAN The last thing we want is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera. \nPAUL We? Paul becomes angry, again sensing that more emphasis is being placed on containing the situation than rescuing him. \nDAN This can't turn into an international incident. \nPAUL That's all you people care about! But what about me? Don't you care about me? \nDAN Trust me, if it was an option, I would do that in a heartbeat. \nPAUL How many others have there been? \nDAN Since I got here? Hundreds. Journalists, contractors, soldiers...hundreds have been taken. It's one of the only functioning businesses out here. \nPAUL How many have you rescued? Dan is reluctant to answer the question. \nPAUL (CONT'D) How many? \nDAN \n(BEAT) Not many. \nPAUL Tell me their names. \nDAN Who? \nPAUL Any of them. Make me know they really do matter to you. \nDAN Mark White. \nPAUL Who was Mark White? \nDAN A kid from New Hampshire. Twenty- six years old. Med student. Came over here to help out local doctors. \nPAUL What happened to him? \nDAN Insurgents grabbed him. \nPAUL When? \nDAN About three weeks ago. Paul writes \"MARK WHITE\" on the top of the coffin, below the list of phone numbers. He circles the name. \nPAUL You remember his name. \nDAN I remember all their names. \nPAUL (afraid to ask) Did he...? Is he...? The glow stick begins to fade. \nDAN Yeah. Yeah, Paul, he's alive. Hearing this affords Paul some semblance of relief. Paul shakes the glow stick, returning it to its full strength. \nPAUL Where is he? \nDAN And you need to save that battery. We're expecting some intel in about ten minutes. Call me back then. \nPAUL Okay. \nDAN Just hang in there, Paul. The glow stick begins to slowly fade. Paul shakes it, causing it to brighten only momentarily before dimming again. \nPAUL Yeah. I'm trying. Dan ends the call. Paul lets out a deep breath, finding it difficult to lay claim to its replacement. He looks at his watch. It's now 7:18pm. The ticking sound of the second hand turning is inordinately loud, due to the extreme silence of the coffin. Just then, the cell phone rings. Checking the number on the display, Paul sees that it is Jabir. Paul answers. \nPAUL What? \nJABIR Did you make video? \nPAUL No. Jabir yells something in Arabic to the other Iraqi men we hear in the background. Collectively, they do not sound pleased. Slightly panicked, in fact, though it is difficult to tell for sure. \nJABIR \n(TO PAUL) You make video! \nPAUL Let me out and I'll make it. \nJABIR No! You make video now. In box. \nPAUL I can't. I can't read the paper. \nJABIR Make video now! \nPAUL I can't. I don't know what you want me to say. I can't read the paper. Jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in the background. Although they speak in Arabic, it is clear from their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly hostile. Jabir returns his attention back to Paul. \nJABIR You make video now. Jabir ends the call. Paul closes the phone to help conserve battery life. He then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu options. Everything is written in Arabic. He eventually comes across an icon with a movie camera -- the video function. He turns it on. Looks at himself though the viewfinder. After a beat, he closes the phone, clearly frustrated and growing more panicked. His breaths grow heavy and rapid, utilizing a great deal of oxygen. \nPAUL I'm never getting out of here. Paul begins to freak out, restlessly squirming inside the coffin and pressing against the sides and top. The glow stick fades out almost completely, offering very little light. Paul shakes it, but with no change to its brightness. Moments later, it dies. Paul tries the flashlight. Click-click. Click-click. Nothing. He bangs it a few times with his hand. The white light turns on, but quickly turns back off. He twists the top, which causes the flashlight to switch bulbs. A red beam emits momentarily. Paul twists the top again and gives the flashlight a few good whacks. \nIt turns on. White light shines dimly on his face. He takes a breath. In efforts to calm himself, he once again removes the orange pill bottle from his pocket. He pours two into his hand. He then removes his small, metal alcohol flask from his back pocket and takes a large swig, swallowing the two pills in the process. Still, Paul's heavy, labored breathing continues. He drops four additional pills into his and swallows them with yet another generous pull from the flask. He sits and waits. Nothing is happening, except that his extremely limited time keeps passing. After a moment, Paul picks up the cell phone. He holds it in front of him, hesitant to make a call. After some consideration, he dials. After a few rings, a NURSING HOME NURSE answers. \nNURSING HOME NURSE Mountain View Nursing Home. \nPAUL I was hoping I could speak with Maryanne Conroy, please. \nNURSING HOME NURSE Um...okay. Ah...let me bring the cordless phone to her room. Hold on a moment, please. We hear the Nurse walk down the tiled corridor floor. She soon reaches Paul's mother's room. \nNURSING HOME NURSE (CONT'D) Misses Conroy, you have a telephone call, dear. Here, you can use this phone. Paul's mother, MARYANNE, answers. Her voice is pleasant but confused. It's clear that she suffers from advanced stages of Alzheimer's Disease. \nMARYANNE Hello? \nPAUL Yeah, I sent...never mind. Listen, I...I'm going to go now. I just wanted to talk to you, you know, just to say bye. I love you, Mom. Maryanne doesn't respond. \nPAUL(CONT'D) Did you hear me? Mom? I told you...do you want to tell me you \nLOVE -- \nMARYANNE Yes, dear. Your father and I have been playing gin rummy every night. \nPAUL (after a beat) Okay, Mom. Tell Pop I said hi. Paul ends the call and instantly begins crying his heart out. He lays there, sobbing relentlessly. After a long beat, the cell phone rings. Decidedly different than his past reactions to an incoming call, Paul seems hopelessly disinterested. The ring is maddening. He mindlessly presses the shortcut button, resetting the ring to vibrate mode. He eventually picks up the phone, but there is not anyone on the other end. It's then that he sees that it was not a call that came in, but instead was a picture message. Pressing what appears to be the Accept button, the incoming picture begins to download. Several seconds later, the picture downloads and an image appears on the display of Paul's cell phone. It's of a woman -- bound and gagged, a gun pressed against the side of her head. \nPAUL Oh no. No, no, no! Paul frantically dials the number to reach Jabir. As soon as the phone connects, Paul begins his desperate plea. \nJABIR Video make? \nPAUL Let her go. Please. Please don't hurt her. The Woman is heard in the background of Jabir's phone, crying muffled words through her muzzled mouth. \nJABIR We shoot her if you no make video. \nPAUL No! No, please no shoot. No shoot her. \nJABIR You get money. American million. \nPAUL I will, I promise. Just don't shoot her. She's a mother, she's got two kids. \nJABIR Two kids? \nPAUL Yes. She has two kids. \nJABIR I have five. Now only one. You make video. Now!! \nPAUL Wait... \nJABIR No wait!! I give three seconds. \nPAUL I can't read the paper. \nJABIR Three... \nPAUL No. Wait! \nJABIR Two... \nPAUL I don't know what you want me to say! \n(MORE) \nPAUL (CONT'D) Please call me as soon as you get this. I love you...I love you. Call me right away. Please. Paul hangs up. He looks at the battery life left on the phone. One bar. He then checks his watch. It's 8:19pm. Both are not good signs, and he knows it. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Oh shit. He begins to panic. Grabbing the pocket knife that was left inside the metal box, he slides the blade in the space between the sides of the coffin and the top. Paul grabs the glow stick. But, because it was partially melted to the floor, the stick snaps in two. Liquid oozes out of the small portion of the stick that remains stuck the floor. \nPAUL Son of a... Paul grabs the flashlight. Turns it on. It works for a second, but then goes out. Shaking it only produces intermittent beams of light. He turns the top, switching to the red bulb. It works. The coffin fills with a reddish hue, but then it, too, goes out. Growing incensed, Paul switches back to the white bulb. It works. He returns his attention to the coffin. His efforts to use the knife as a fulcrum are futile. Still, he tries. Bending the blade well past its design, it nearly breaks off its handle. The flashlight turns off. After a good shaking, it turns back on, emitting white light. With oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts of this kind are all too much for Paul to take. He has to stop and try to catch his breath. As he endeavors to get his wind back, the cell phone rings. Not a call this time, but instead a video message. It has been sent by Jabir. Paul's trepidation is evident. He fears what the incoming video may show. \nAfter a beat, he presses the Accept button and the video downloads. Within seconds, the video plays on his phone display screen. We see, in the video, the American Woman that previously appeared in a picture message that was sent to Paul. She is still bound at her wrists, but her gag has been lowered. She sits on her knees. Standing behind her are three men, all with their faces shielded by Arab headdresses. They each hold AK-47 assault weapons. Paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks, through her tears, into the camera. \nWOMAN My name is Pamela Gorham. I'm a food service worker at F.O.B. Anaconda, employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas. My captors' requests for ransom have gone unanswered, and -- The Woman, Pamela, looks off-screen to her right. Someone is fast approaching her. She cowers, protectively holding her bound hands in front of her face as she screams. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) (to the person) No...wait!! Please -- no!! Another Iraqi man steps into the camera's line of site, a handgun already brandished. Without as much as a moment's hesitation, he fires two rounds directly into Pamela's head, killing her. \nThe video message ends immediately thereafter. Paul is in complete shock. He screams aloud, slamming his closed fist against the bottom of the coffin. \nPAUL No! No, no, no!!! Still in the throes of emotional torment, Paul vomits on himself. He doubles over, only to vomit once again. His body, taxed almost to the point of complete physical breakdown, gradually slows and levels itself. With his vomit- smeared face pressed cheek-down onto the bottom of the coffin, Paul stares into nothingness. \nAfter a beat, his eye catches a glimmer of light -- the blade of the knife, reflecting off the beam of the flashlight. Paul reaches for the knife. Lying on his back, still suffering enormous mental strain, he places the cutting edge of the blade against his neck. His jugular vein. His hand shakes, his lips tremble. The hand that holds the blade tightens its grip on the handle. It, too, shakes. Paul closes his eyes. A small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his neck, where the blade of the knife rests, ready to open his vein. \nAfter a great deal of consideration, Paul throws the knife to the foot of the coffin. He can't do it. The flashlight falls from Paul's chest. It turns off upon landing on the floor of the coffin. Paul sits in darkness. His breaths echo off the coffin walls. After a beat, he turns on the flashlight. It turns off after less than two seconds. This time, however, he does not shake it, nor does he hit it. A moment later, we hear a click, followed by the sight of a red light beam emitting from the flashlight. It holds steady. \nPaul shines it onto the names and phone numbers written on the top of the coffin. He stops at \"MARK WHITE.\" After a beat, he lowers the flashlight to his side. He picks up the phone and dials Brenner. After one ring, Brenner answers. He's clearly not pleased. Paul, however, is surprisingly calm. Detached. Almost disturbingly so. \nDAN Why the hell did you make that video? \nPAUL It's all a bunch of lies. \nDAN What is? What are you talking about? \nPAUL All of it. \nDAN All of what? \nPAUL Nobody gives a shit about any of us. We're nothing to you people. \nDAN We're going to find you. \nPAUL By looking the other way? \nDAN You can't start breaking on me now, Paul. You have to stay strong. \nPAUL You let her die. \n(BEAT) What the hell happened out there, Paul? \nPaul doesn't answer at first. \nDAN (CONT'D) Paul. After a beat: \nPAUL We had just left Anaconda, everything seemed okay. We knew that a bunch of our CB radios had been stolen and that the Iraqis were listening in, so we made sure to switch from our usual channels. Pam was riding with Jeff Breer, the convoy commander. She wanted to ride with me like she usually did when she hitched a ride from base, but it seemed safer for her to be with the C.C. As we headed down the road, all these kids came running into the street. Dozens of them. It almost seemed like they were expecting us, except we got there faster than they thought we would. So they run on up in front of me, and I slam on my brakes. The rest of the drivers were already further up ahead, so they kept going. Next thing I know, one of the lead trucks got hit by an IED. I hear Tommy Wilkes on the radio saying, Sandman's hit, Sandman's hit. He's...he's everywhere. \n(MORE) \nPAUL (CONT'D) That's when the Iraqis came out of their mud huts from the side of the road and started shooting everybody. I couldn't believe what was happening. It seemed like slow- motion, like I was watching it on TV. People -- my friends -- were getting killed, and all I could do is watch. I didn't even notice that the kids were throwing bricks and rocks at me until one split my windshield. Sort of snapped me out of my trance. But then, I guess I got hit in the head with a rock, `cause I blacked out. \nDAN Do you happen to remem...mo... nea... The cell phone service begins to cut out. Suddenly, the coffin begins to vibrate slightly, dropping sand granules through the crack and onto the wood bottom, followed by the faint sound of an explosion. Within seconds, the explosions grow louder and more proximate. The vibration becomes so intense that it violently shakes Paul around the coffin. The sound of jet plane engines are heard coming from above, flying by as the massive explosions continue. Sand seeps in through the crack between the top and sides of the coffin as it shakes. Paul does his best to brace himself, but the bombardment is far too powerful. \nA large crack forms in the wooden cover to the coffin, spanning almost its entire length. Sand immediately pours through the concave shaped crack, seeping in onto Paul like an hourglass. Fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the immense pressure from the sand above, Paul positions himself underneath it and presses with all his might. He grunts and screams loudly, using what little strength he has left to keep the top from caving. The shaking soon stops, though the steady flow of sand continues. \nIn efforts to prevent the sand from filling the coffin any faster, Paul removes the button-down shirt from the hole and stuffs into the area where it enters with the greatest volume. He removes the balled-up cloth from the other hole and does the same with it. Both offer very little help. The flashlight falls to the floor. The red light beam turns off. Darkness. The sound of sand steadily pouring down. \nPAUL \n(EXHAUSTED) Oh no...no... Paul clicks the flashlight to a different setting. White light shines, but then goes out. He shakes the flashlight and it stays on, shining its normal white beam. \nHe assesses his situation, noticing that the coffin is already filled with a small layer of sand; a situation that is only going to get worse with time. \nPAUL This can't be happening. We see that Dan Brenner is no longer on the phone, and that the display menu shows an icon of a phone with a line through it -- No Service Available. Once he feels it is secure enough, Paul slowly moves his body away from the crack. Although slightly caved, it does not show any more signs of possible collapse. Sweat drenches his face. His eyes affixed, in utter disbelief, on the sand as it spills into the coffin, filling in around him inch-by-inch. \nHe grabs the cell phone, only to see that he does not have a signal. \nPAUL (CONT'D) No. Come on. Please work. He shakes the cell phone and moves it all around the coffin, hoping that it may somehow help. His efforts are futile. The flashlight goes dead. He hits it, shakes it. It turns back on. The brightness is diminished. Still the sand continues to fall, drowning him deeper and deeper in a pool of granules. Then, very surprisingly, the cell phone rings. Paul answers right away. \nPAUL \n(FRANTICALLY) Hello? Hello? Who's there? Alan Davenport answers calmly from the other end. \nALAN DAVENPORT Is this Paul Conroy? \nPAUL Yes. Yes, this is Paul. Who are you? \nALAN DAVENPORT Paul, my name's Alan Davenport, I'm the personnel director here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas. \nPAUL I left you a message. \nALAN DAVENPORT You did. I also heard from Rebecca Browning over at the State Department. Are you able to speak on the status of your situation? \nALAN DAVENPORT Thank you. Now, Mister Conroy, when were you hired by CRT? \nPAUL About nine months ago. Around January of 2005. Why are you wasting time with this? \nALAN DAVENPORT I have your official date of hire as January 4th, 2005. Is that correct? \nPAUL Who cares? This is fucking crazy -- \nALAN DAVENPORT January 4th, 2005. Is that correct? \nPAUL Yes! \nALAN DAVENPORT And during your initial training, before being sent to Iraq, were you made aware of the dangers inherent to the position for which you were hired. \nPAUL You mean when I came down there to Dallas and you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have bulletproof glass? The flashlight dims. Paul angrily shakes it, returning it to full strength. \nPAUL (CONT'D) You mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here? Is that when I was made aware? \nALAN DAVENPORT I need you to answer yes or no, please. \nPAUL \n(BEAT) Yes. The flashlight begins to slowly dim. \nALAN DAVENPORT During that time, did you also receive and sign an employment contract with CRT, which thoroughly explained company policy as it pertained to your specific terms of employment? \nPAUL Yeah, I signed a bunch of things. \nALAN DAVENPORT Yes or no. \nPAUL Yes. I signed the contract. Yes! \nALAN DAVENPORT It's our understanding that you were taken hostage in Iraq two hours ago, is that also correct? \nPAUL Yes. That's completely correct. What is the point of all this? \nAlan breaks from the H.R. handbook script, though his tone remains just as matter-of-fact. The flashlight continues its steady, slow dim. \nALAN DAVENPORT Our legal department requires that we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees, confirming that they understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company. As of this morning, your employment with CRT was officially terminated. \nPAUL Wait, wait, wait -- The flashlight dims even more. \nALAN DAVENPORT It was brought to our attention that you were engaging in relations with a fellow CRT employee -- Pamela Gorham. \nJABIR You cut off thumb finger, send video. \nPAUL I'm not doing that. \nJABIR Yes! Paul puts the batteries back inside the flashlight. Begins screwing on the cap. \nPAUL No. \nJABIR No? \nPAUL That's right, no. You let me out of here, and I'll cut off my whole God damn hand if you want. Jabir again says something to someone in the room with him, returning to Paul after a brief moment. Paul finishes closing the top of the flashlight. \nJABIR You have wife? Click. The flashlight turns on! \nPaul considers Jabir's question to be a potential sign of compassion. \nPAUL Yes, I do. And a son. A young son. I want to go home...to see them. Please, sir. \nJABIR Sir? \nPAUL Yes. Sir. I say that out of respect...to you. \nJABIR 243 East Walnut Street. Hastings, Michigan. U.S.A. \nPAUL \n(CONCERNED) That's my...why did you say that? \nJABIR You show blood...or they show blood. \nPAUL That's...you're lying. You're nobody...all of you. You can't get to them. \nJABIR No? \nPAUL No. You're peasants, criminals, that's all. You don't even know where Michigan is. \nJABIR Detroit. Ann Arbor. Even this basic knowledge is enough to make Jabir's threats that much more real. \nPAUL You looked at a map. That's all you did. \nJABIR You show blood, or they show blood. Send video by five minutes. Jabir ends the call. Realizing that Jabir is gone, Paul quickly dials his wife's cell phone. After several rings, her voice mail picks up. \nLINDA (V.O.) Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message. Thanks and have a great day. \nPAUL I'm...here. \nDAN We're coming for you now. You hear me? We know where you are. \nThis news serves as somewhat of an adrenaline rush for Paul, who musters up even the modicum of strength he seemingly did not have left in him. \nPAUL You're coming? \nDAN We are, Paul. We're almost there now. \nPAUL How do you know? \nDAN Coalition forces picked up a Shiite insurgent just outside of Baghdad. \n(MORE) \nDAN (CONT'D) Said he knew where an American was buried alive. He agreed to show us where if we let him go. \nPAUL You're coming for me? \nDAN We're practically there already. An impossible smile fights its way to Paul's lips. His momentary joy is just that, however, for the sand has almost completely filled the coffin by this point. \nPAUL You have to hurry. \nDAN We are. \nPAUL No...you have to hurry. The sand...it's filling up fast. \nDAN Just hang in there for three more minutes. This will all be over soon, I promise. Paul is very hopeful that Dan is correct in his assumption. \nPAUL Okay. I believe you. Thank you. Thank you. A beep is heard. Paul has another call coming in. He's visibly elated upon seeing who it is. \nDAN Three minutes. Try to -- \nPAUL I have to go! \nDAN Paul, no -- \nPAUL Call me right back. \nDAN Paul! \nPAUL Call me right back. Paul switches to the other call, despite the fact that he has a mere eight inches left before the entire coffin is filled with sand from top-to-bottom. He holds the flashlight just above the top of the sand pile, allowing it to illuminate what little unoccupied area remains. \nPAUL I should have never come here. You were right. I'm sorry. \nLINDA Sweetie, I don't care. I just want you home. Please come home to me. \nPAUL I will. \nLINDA Swear it. \nPAUL I will. I swear I will. Paul then receives a call on the other line. He checks to see who's calling. It's Dan Brenner. \nPAUL (CONT'D) They're here! \nLINDA The people? \nPAUL They're calling me right now. I have to go. \nLINDA Call me right away. \nPAUL I will. I love you. \nLINDA I love you. Swear it again. \nPAUL I swear. I have to go. Paul clicks over to the other line, where Dan Brenner waits to speak with him. We hear Dan yelling to people who are with him. A great deal of commotion and action is heard through the phone. \nDAN Move! Move! Let's go. \nPAUL Brenner? \nDAN Paul? Paul? \nPAUL It's me. \nDAN We're here! Dan yells to one of the soldiers who are with him. \nDAN (CONT'D) Corporal, get your men over here! Dan gets back on the phone with Paul \nDAN (CONT'D) He brought us right to you. \nDAN (CONT'D) (to the soldiers) Start digging! Let's go, let's go! The flashlight fades. Paul hits it, momentarily returning it to full strength. Meanwhile, the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the very top. It continues to pour in from the crack, seemingly faster than ever. Paul struggles to keep his head above the sand, giving him only a few inches between his face and the top of the coffin. \nPAUL You have to hurry. It's almost full. \nDAN Just hang in there! \n", "test1_input": "BURIED \nWritten by \nChris Sparling \nFADE IN: \nINT. UNKNOWN ROOM - NIGHT \nDarkness. Silence. After a long beat, we hear movement, confined and contained. We then hear the sound of a man, PAUL CONROY, groaning, making confused attempts at words. We hear his movement; short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with the sound of his body banging against wood. He screams, though it's clear from the sound that his mouth is covered by something. After attempting to sit up, he immediately bangs his head against something. It's terribly warm and his breaths are labored. He attempts to move to his left and right, only to find that he is confined on those sides, as well. He frantically shifts about, only to discover, by touch, that he is encased in something. Something is very wrong, and he doesn't need to see to know that. Finally, we see him, lit by the flame of the Zippo he holds in his hands, which are bound together in front of him with rope. A rolled-up, dirty rag is tied tightly around his head, stretched across his mouth. Dried blood stains his hair and forehead. \nWe see that he is lying in an old fashioned, wooden coffin. Nothing more than a few rotted-out planks of wood nailed together. Realizing the same, Paul is struck by an overwhelming, instant panic. With great difficulty, and while still holding the lit Zippo, Paul removes the muzzle from his mouth. \nPAUL What...? What is this? His words become almost unintelligible as he flails about, though fear is understood in his every utterance. He screams aloud, but his voice is captured by the coffin walls. \nPAUL Oh my God! Help me!! Help me!! He kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of the coffin, all to no avail. His violent movements cause small grains of sand to trickle in through the space between the sides and top of the coffin, as well as a small gap that exists between one of the coffin's broken wooden planks. Sweat cascades down the side of his neck, dripping from his dampened brow. The heat inside the extremely close confines of the coffin is stifling. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Somebody help me! Please!! Paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top of the coffin. The sides, the top, the bottom -- all are too thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the coffin. Sand. It becomes clear to him that he is buried. He tries his best to calm himself, though he has trouble catching his breath. It takes him some time, but he eventually achieves some semblance of calm. Getting a good look at him for the first time, we see that Paul is somewhere around 37 years old. Unshaven and physically unremarkable, he embodies the blue-collar American everyman. He coughs. The minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes it hard for him to breathe. His eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed, rusty nail. He tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old, frayed ropes that bind his hands. Doing so is no easy task. The incredibly tight quarters makes his every action nearly impossible. After a lengthy struggle, the rope snaps. Paul quickly frees his hands. A small victory. Very small. The heat is unbearable. Paul takes off his button-down shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt. His body battles against the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move he makes. He tosses his button-down shirt down by his feet. His undershirt is drenched through with sweat. Still trying to calm himself, but having little success in doing so, Paul looks around the coffin. His feet, though only his body-length away, seem miles from him. \nHe looks at the top of the coffin, and then back at his feet. With great difficulty, he shifts his body so that his feet are pressed against the top of the coffin. He attempts to use his leg strength to push the top off of him, but it doesn't move even a millimeter. After several failed attempts, and with his legs exhausted, Paul drops his feet from the top of the coffin. He lay for a moment in silence, followed by an outburst of crying. Close to his head, on the corner of the floor, we see there's another broken plank. A small hole. He closes his cigarette lighter, extinguishing the flame. In total darkness, he continues to cry. \nPAUL (CONT'D) What is this? With his sobbing slowly subsiding, the coffin soon grows eerily silent. The sound of Paul's labored breaths are all we hear, softened under the blanket of absolute darkness. After a beat, the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing sound. The muted sight of strange, blueish light flickers in the coffin, by Paul's feet. He is extremely startled. The buzzing continues, as does the minimal splashing of light. It's coming from underneath his discarded button-down shirt, down near his feet. He lights the Zippo to get a better look. \nPulling the shirt away, he realizes that what he is hearing and seeing is the vibrating ring and display features of an older model cell phone. He frantically reaches for it, though the coffin is far too small for him to reposition himself so easily. To his dismay, the phone stops ringing. But, his efforts to reach it continue. He uses his feet to search for the phone. After some trouble finding it, he eventually locates it. Clamping the phone together between his clasped feet, Paul then painfully angles his body so that he can reach his feet with his hands and grab it. He is soon able to reach it. Immediately thereafter, he flips open the phone and puts the receiver in front of him. \nWe see that there is a Text Message waiting for Paul on the phone. However, Paul barely notices. The time on the phone reads 6:12pm. While the numbers and display screen icons are familiar to Americans, all the words are in Arabic. What he does notices is that the phone barely has one bar of signal strength. Worse yet, there is only half of the battery life remaining. He tries to remember the Safe Number he was given. With the phone open and ready to be dialed, Paul struggles to recall the information. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Come on, come on. What was it? \nGetting only two digits into dialing the number, he cannot remember much more and closes the phone. He wedges the lit Zippo into sand, which is compacted against a small hole in the wall of the coffin. Paul reaches into his pants pocket, frantically searching for something. He hastily removes a prescription pill bottle and a small, metal flask. Both are not what he was looking for. He then reaches to his back pocket and removes his wallet. It's empty. His license, his credit cards, his cash and, most importantly at that very moment, a piece of paper with the Safe Number written on it, are all missing. \nPAUL (CONT'D) No. Where the hell is it? Son of a...Come on! \nHe screams aloud again, hoping greatly that someone can hear him. His frenzied maneuvering puts out the flame of the Zippo. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Help me! Please! Somebody help me! His words barely make it pass the coffin walls. With the cell phone still in hand, and laboring to reclaim the breath he just expended, Paul turns to desperation. He dials the international code of 001, and then dials 911. A FEMALE 911 OPERATOR answers almost immediately. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR 911, please hold. The Female 911 Operator places Paul on hold. \nPAUL No! Wait! Paul accidentally bangs the cap of the Zippo against the coffin wall, putting out the flame. She quickly returns. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR 911. What is your emergency? \n", "test1_true": "FEMALE 911 OPERATOR 911. What's the problem, sir? Paul is so incredibly panicked that he has trouble remaining coherent. After a few sparks, the Zippo is re-lit. \nPAUL I'm buried. You have to help me.

No. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR How are calling me right now? \nPAUL What? \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR If you're buried in a coffin, where are you calling from? \nPAUL A cell phone. There was an old cell phone in the coffin. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR You're calling from your cell phone? \nPAUL Yes. No. It's not mine, but yes, I'm calling from a cell phone. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR There was a cell phone in the coffin when you climbed in? \nPAUL I didn't climb in. \nFEMALE 911 OPERATOR How did you end up in the coffin, sir? \n", "test1_id": 1140, "test2_input": "PAUL Well, since you know what the hell is going on, what have you done to get me out of here? \nREBECCA There's little we can do from Washington. \nPAUL So, that's it?

You're not the one stuck in a coffin, buried in the God damn desert! \nREBECCA I understand your frustration -- \nPAUL Frustration? Lady, I'm going to fucking die in here. Understand that! Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone. Paul wonders if she is still there. The idea of being alone again scares him terribly. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Hello? Worried, Paul lights the Zippo. The reflection of the flame dances on his frightened eyes. \nREBECCA I'm here. \n", "test2_true": "PAUL Well, then say something. Tell me how you're going to get me out of here. \nREBECCA What's the number on the phone you're calling from? \nPAUL I don't know.

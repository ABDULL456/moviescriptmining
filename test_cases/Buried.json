{"test1_input": "DAN And you need to save that battery. We're expecting some intel in about ten minutes. Call me back then. \nPAUL Okay. \nDAN Just hang in there, Paul. The glow stick begins to slowly fade. Paul shakes it, causing it to brighten only momentarily before dimming again. \nPAUL Yeah. I'm trying. Dan ends the call. Paul lets out a deep breath, finding it difficult to lay claim to its replacement. He looks at his watch. It's now 7:18pm. The ticking sound of the second hand turning is inordinately loud, due to the extreme silence of the coffin. Just then, the cell phone rings. Checking the number on the display, Paul sees that it is Jabir. Paul answers. \nPAUL What? \nJABIR Did you make video? \nPAUL No. Jabir yells something in Arabic to the other Iraqi men we hear in the background. Collectively, they do not sound pleased. Slightly panicked, in fact, though it is difficult to tell for sure. \nJABIR \n(TO PAUL) You make video! \nPAUL Let me out and I'll make it. \nJABIR No! You make video now. In box. \nPAUL I can't. I can't read the paper. \nJABIR Make video now! \nPAUL I can't. I don't know what you want me to say. I can't read the paper. Jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in the background. Although they speak in Arabic, it is clear from their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly hostile. Jabir returns his attention back to Paul. \nJABIR You make video now. Jabir ends the call. Paul closes the phone to help conserve battery life. He then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu options. Everything is written in Arabic. He eventually comes across an icon with a movie camera -- the video function. He turns it on. Looks at himself though the viewfinder. After a beat, he closes the phone, clearly frustrated and growing more panicked. His breaths grow heavy and rapid, utilizing a great deal of oxygen. \nPAUL I'm never getting out of here. Paul begins to freak out, restlessly squirming inside the coffin and pressing against the sides and top. The glow stick fades out almost completely, offering very little light. Paul shakes it, but with no change to its brightness. Moments later, it dies. Paul tries the flashlight. Click-click. Click-click. Nothing. He bangs it a few times with his hand. The white light turns on, but quickly turns back off. He twists the top, which causes the flashlight to switch bulbs. A red beam emits momentarily. Paul twists the top again and gives the flashlight a few good whacks. \nIt turns on. White light shines dimly on his face. He takes a breath. In efforts to calm himself, he once again removes the orange pill bottle from his pocket. He pours two into his hand. He then removes his small, metal alcohol flask from his back pocket and takes a large swig, swallowing the two pills in the process. Still, Paul's heavy, labored breathing continues. He drops four additional pills into his and swallows them with yet another generous pull from the flask. He sits and waits. Nothing is happening, except that his extremely limited time keeps passing. After a moment, Paul picks up the cell phone. He holds it in front of him, hesitant to make a call. After some consideration, he dials. After a few rings, a NURSING HOME NURSE answers. \nNURSING HOME NURSE Mountain View Nursing Home. \nPAUL I was hoping I could speak with Maryanne Conroy, please. \nNURSING HOME NURSE Um...okay. Ah...let me bring the cordless phone to her room. Hold on a moment, please. We hear the Nurse walk down the tiled corridor floor. She soon reaches Paul's mother's room. \nNURSING HOME NURSE (CONT'D) Misses Conroy, you have a telephone call, dear. Here, you can use this phone. Paul's mother, MARYANNE, answers. Her voice is pleasant but confused. It's clear that she suffers from advanced stages of Alzheimer's Disease. \nMARYANNE Hello? \n", "test1_true": "MARYANNE Who? \nPAUL It's Paul, Mom. Your son. \nMARYANNE My son? \nPAUL It's okay, Mom. How are you? \nMARYANNE I'm fine. \nPAUL That's good. \nMARYANNE Who are you? \nPAUL It's your son, Mom. It's Paulie. \nMARYANNE Paulie? \nPAUL Yeah. Remember? We lived over on Colfax Street, in the duplex. Remember? \nMARYANNE \n(REMEMBERING SLIGHTLY) Paulie? \nPAUL That's right, Mom. \nMARYANNE Is this Paulie? \nPAUL It is, Mom. It's Paulie. How's everything at the home? \nMARYANNE Very nice. Your father and I have been playing gin rummy every night. It's almost too much for Paul to take. He cries silent tears over a heartbroken smile. \nPAUL Yeah...I don't think Pop's there with you, Mom. \nMARYANNE How are you doing, sweetie? \nPAUL Not very good. This...uh, this may be the last time I talk to you. \nMARYANNE That's nice, honey. \nPAUL Did you get the flowers I sent a few months ago? \nMARYANNE Flowers? \n", "test1_id": 1140, "test2_input": "PAUL They're dead. \nDAN How do you know that? \nPAUL I just do. \nDAN Three F-16s levelled parts of the city a few minutes ago. \nPAUL I know. I felt it. Did they know I was here? The Zippo flame flutters. Weakens. \nDAN (after a beat) Yeah. \nPAUL Did they care? Dan does not answer. \nPAUL (CONT'D) These people that took me -- if they're dead, they can't tell you where I am. \nDAN We can still try to track down your signal. \nPAUL You tried that already. \nDAN We can try again. Paul appreciates Dan's effort, but he knows there is little hope left for him. \nPAUL (CONT'D) It's over, isn't it? After a long beat: \nDAN No. Paul doesn't say a word. He knows that Dan is lying. After a beat, Dan comes clean. \nDAN (CONT'D) Yeah. \nThe flame of the Zippo becomes smaller. It clearly has little life left. \nPAUL What should I do? \nDAN I don't know. \nPAUL That's right -- just like everyone else on the planet, there are some things you know and some things you don't. \nDAN I wish this could have gone differently. \nPAUL Yeah...me too. After a long beat, Paul ends the call. He forces a smile to his lachrymose face. Utterly hopeless, he opens the phone and turns on the video feature. He turns the phone to face himself, projecting his image on the display. He presses Record. \nPAUL (CONT'D) This is Paul Steven Conroy. Social Security number 048-32-1198, date of birth 3/19/68. This video will serve as my last will and testament. To my wife, Linda Conroy, I leave the seven hundred dollars in my personal savings and whatever I have left in my annuity. To my son, Shane Conroy, I...I don't know. I don't have anything else. My stuff, like, my clothes. I wish I had more...I wish I had done more. Your dad wasn't really much of anything, Shane, I'm sorry. Maybe if I was a famous baseball player, or a guy who wore a suit to work, I would have more to leave you. But, you can be one of those people if you want. You can be whatever you want. Just promise me that when you get older, you'll take good care of your mom. And promise me that you'll always try to do the right thing, no matter what. I love you very much, Shane. Maybe I never said that enough...maybe I did, I don't even know. That probably means I didn't. \n(BEAT) I'm sorry, Linda. I should have listened to you. Paul ends the video and closes the phone. He carefully places the phone into his pocket, where it may hopefully be found if he ever is. \n", "test2_true": "Paul answers immediately. \nPAUL You're not dead. Jabir is heard speaking frantically in Arabic to the several other people in the room with him. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Hello? Hello?! Jabir turns his attention to Paul. \nJABIR Where is money? \nPAUL I don't know. \nJABIR What don't know? \nPAUL I don't know where the money is. \nJABIR Liar! \nPAUL I'm not lying! I swear. \nJABIR Swear? \nPAUL I'm telling the truth. \nSounding panicked, Jabir again speaks in Arabic to the other people in the room with him. They respond accordingly. Paul tries to turn on the flashlight. It doesn't work. Jabir returns his scornful attention to Paul. \nJABIR From Embassy, you get money now! \nPAUL I can't! \nJABIR You will!! \nPAUL I need more time. Please. Paul shakes and hits the flashlight. It still does not work. \nJABIR No more time! \nPAUL There's sand pouring in here. I can't...it's everywhere. Please, let me out of here and I will get you the money. Jabir utters something in Arabic to someone standing next to him, seemingly asking a question and getting an answer from the same individual. Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight. Switches the positioning of the batteries. Screws the cap back on. Hits the switch. Nothing. Jabir returns to the phone. \nJABIR (CONT'D) You show blood. \nPAUL What? Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight again. Removes the batteries. Bites down on them a few times. Blows hard inside the flashlight tube. \nJABIR You show blood, they give money. \nPAUL No. \n", "test2_id": 1141, "test3_input": "PAUL I should have never come here. You were right. I'm sorry. \nLINDA Sweetie, I don't care. I just want you home. Please come home to me. \nPAUL I will. \nLINDA Swear it. \nPAUL I will. I swear I will. Paul then receives a call on the other line. He checks to see who's calling. It's Dan Brenner. \nPAUL (CONT'D) They're here! \nLINDA The people? \nPAUL They're calling me right now. I have to go. \nLINDA Call me right away. \nPAUL I will. I love you. \nLINDA I love you. Swear it again. \nPAUL I swear. I have to go. Paul clicks over to the other line, where Dan Brenner waits to speak with him. We hear Dan yelling to people who are with him. A great deal of commotion and action is heard through the phone. \nDAN Move! Move! Let's go. \nPAUL Brenner? \nDAN Paul? Paul? \nPAUL It's me. \nDAN We're here! Dan yells to one of the soldiers who are with him. \nDAN (CONT'D) Corporal, get your men over here! Dan gets back on the phone with Paul \nDAN (CONT'D) He brought us right to you. \nDAN (CONT'D) (to the soldiers) Start digging! Let's go, let's go! The flashlight fades. Paul hits it, momentarily returning it to full strength. Meanwhile, the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the very top. It continues to pour in from the crack, seemingly faster than ever. Paul struggles to keep his head above the sand, giving him only a few inches between his face and the top of the coffin. \nPAUL You have to hurry. It's almost full. \nDAN Just hang in there! \n", "test3_true": "DAN (to the soldiers) Dig! Dig! Dig! Paul fights to keep his head above the sand.

We're right above you. The level of sand grows even higher. Paul spits away falling sand that threatens to suffocate him. \nPAUL I can't hear you! Where are you? \nDAN We're almost there. A SOLDIER is heard OFF-SCREEN in the b.g. of Dan's phone. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) There it is! \nDAN (to the soldiers) Keep digging!! \nPAUL Hurry! Please!!! \nDAN We see the coffin! Just hang in there!! Paul coughs out sand. He has a mere inch left above his head. \nPAUL Hurry! Where are you? I don't hear you? Please hurry!!! \nThe Soldier is again heard OFF-SCREEN in the b.g. Of Dan's phone. \nSOLDIER It's clear! \nDAN (to the soldier) Open it! Nondescript noise is heard through the phone, until it comes to an abrupt stop. \nDAN \n(SHOCKED) Oh my God. \nPAUL What is it?! \nDAN I'm so sorry, Paul. \nPAUL What?!! \nDAN It's Mark White. He brought us to Mark White. I'm -- We see the circled name of \"MARK WHITE\" written in capital letters on the top of the coffin. \n", "test3_id": 1142}

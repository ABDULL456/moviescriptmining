{"train": "\"STARMAN\" \nScreenplay by \nBruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon \nwith Dean Riesner (uncredited) \nDRAFT SCRIPT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nA frightened SECURITY GUARD is tensed forward off the back seat, his hands clutched into the fabric between the two regular POLICE OFFICERS in front. \nGUARD (an edge of fear in his voice) It's coming up... Slow down... (he points out between them) There, right there... \nThrough the windshield we can see the headlights pick up a billboard announcing a 'new' housing development. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and starts up a rutted dirt road. The sign tells us we are headed for 'Pinewood Estates,' a housing development financed by the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nThe Security Guard is becoming more agitated. He wipes a cold sweat off his brow. The blue flashers reflect off the fog onto the faces of the men. Suddenly the Security Guard lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren. \nOFFICER (startled) Benny, God, take it easy... \nBENNY (GUARD) I don't want to scare them away. \nThe two Police Officers exchange an indulgent look. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \nUsing only its parking lights, the police car creeps up the dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nThe windows are rolled down. Periodically one of the men leans out for a better look at the terrain around them. \nSECOND OFFICER Smells smoke... \nBENNY I told you. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \nThe police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops. Above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. The men get out of the car. \nBENNY (loud whisper) There!! Up on the hill!! \nThe officer steps forward for a better look. Benny hangs on his shoulder. \nBENNY Right in line with that burning tree. \nOFFICER I don't see anything. \nBENNY It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires? \nThe officer strains to see through the fog. \nOFFICER Benny, there's nothing there. \nBENNY There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses. \nOFFICER Flew?! Oh, come on Benny... \nThe second officer is peering intently at something down among the houses. \nOFFICER You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling us... \nMIKE (SECOND OFFICER) What's that? \nBenny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing. What appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among the houses below them. Further into the track another beam of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise stationary. \nBENNY What did I tell you? \nOFFICER Probably kids. \nOne of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other side. \nMIKE (not convinced) Probably... \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \nFrom the road Benny and the officer watch as the humanoid figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the spacecraft. The noise from the ship's power plant is deafening as it begins to rise above the trees. \nWith Mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer. As they jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the super white beam of the figure that was in the house. They are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises his shotgun and fires wildly at it. The figure veers off and disappears into the fog. \nWith an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity and hurtles into the night sky. The concussion waves knock Benny and the officers off their feet. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT \nThe escaped figure's light comes out of the fog at tree height. We hear the high-pitched whistle of its rockets. A burst of percussive language comes from behind the faceplate. \nSUBTITLE Lander four to Mapmaker Wind. Fix position for rescue. Repeat. Fix position for rescue. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \nThe fires on the hillside have been renewed. Shaking, Benny and the officer rise to their feet and start toward the light shafting straight up from the figure lying on the hillside. The only sound is police chatter coming out of the radio in the open squad car. \nEXT. LOGGING ROAD - NIGHT \nAn 18-wheeler with a load of logs lumbers past us. \nINT. TRUCK - NIGHT \nIt feels cozy with the wipers slapping the rain off the windshield. The DRIVER is trying to steal a cigarette out of his snoring PARTNER'S pocket without waking him up. He gets one and reaches for the lighter. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT \nThe escaped figure banks around a blind corner. \nINT. TRUCK - NIGHT \nThe driver gets a glimpse of something in his headlights and slams on the brakes, but it is too late. The figure hits the spoiler above the cab. We hear the smack of impact. One of its boots scars the windshield. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT \nThe figure bounces off the jack-knifing truck and like a wounded bird tumbles through the air into the trees. With the light spinning crazily, it plunges through the boughs and smashes face first into the mud at the bottom of an embankment. The strip lights on the sides of its helmet go out. \nEXT. TRUCK - NIGHT \nThe driver and his partner, standing in the shafts of the high beams, are peering into the woods. \nPARTNER What the hell was it anyway? \nDRIVER Damned if I know. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nThe figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close a shoulder-to-hip tear in its life-support suit. By the faint identification light that flickers on and off inside its helmet, we see a MAN FROM THE STARS. His skin is translucent coral. He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and threatens to suffocate him. \nUnder his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head. He is hairless. Underneath a graceful fore-head, transparent eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. The thin lips that delineate his mouth are chalk-white. \nHe tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too weak. His hands drop limply from the suit, allowing the rent to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath. \nPARTNER (V.O.) Come on. I'm getting wet. \nDRIVER (V.O.) It musta been a bird. \nPARTNER (V.O.) How about if I drive now? \nBehind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from the shining mass in the STAR MAN'S head and moves down his neck. Through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at the top of his single lung. The white light spreads throughout the organ like a phosphorescent tide. The STAR MAN lapses into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away. \nINT. HELICOPTER (COCKPIT) - DAWNBREAK \nA light rain is falling. \nWe are looking through the windscreen at the gray landscape passing under the helicopter. MARC SHERMIN, a grizzled man in his mid-fifties with an honest stubborn face, shifts his attention from the right side to the left side of the craft. Below him he can see the road leading into the housing tract is blocked by police cars. The helicopter leans into a banking turn and the spacecraft's blackened landing site comes into view. Below it an orange nylon tent has been erected over the dead extraterrestrial. It glows from the inside. An Air Force helicopter is parked on the other side of the burn. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - DAWNBREAK \nA man in a white contamination suit is helping Benny and the two officers into the Air Force helicopter. The three men are glassy-eyed and wrapped in blankets. Benny has a bandage across his chest. They look up at Shermin's descending helicopter. They are still looking at it when they disappear inside. \nShermin's unmarked S65 settles on the clearing. The nose door is open and Shermin, carrying the hood of his contamination suit, comes down the ladder. A tall homespun man, also in a hoodless contamination suit, steps forward to greet him. \nMAN (around a cigarette) Major Aaron Bell... \nSHERMIN Marc Shermin, National Security Agency. \nShermin takes a moment to look over at the tent, the green hillside and the forest beyond. It is pastoral in the soft light of dawn. \nSHERMIN This has always been my favorite time of day. \nMAJOR BELL (MAN) Very beautiful country up here... \nSHERMIN Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that? \nMAJOR BELL Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going. \nSHERMIN Can you see under the faceplate? \nMAJOR BELL No. \nSHERMIN (answering the accusation) Neither did I. \nMajor Bell enters the helicopter. \nFOX We're going... Damn! (he shakes his head in disbelief) We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin? \nMAJOR BELL Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship? \nFOX (ignores this) Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground. \nSHERMIN We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here. \nFOX I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need. \nSHERMIN Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing? \nFox sits silently for a second. \nFOX Contain it and get back to me. \nSHERMIN What do you mean by 'contain?' \nFox knows Shermin is looking for a definite order. \nFOX Just what I said. \nThe television screen is reduced to static. Shermin stares at it blankly then Lyman turns it off. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - MORNING \nThe lift off of Shermin's helicopter reveals contamination -- suited scientists slipping the dead extraterrestrial's coffin into the Air Force helicopter. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nThe STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are of particular interest to him. \nWhen he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on. \nKeeping to the tree line well above them he continues his search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car. \nVOICES It was great to have you back... The kids loved it. We loved it. You're doing the right thing... \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nJENNY I hope so... We'll see... See you tomorrow... Bye. Bye. \nVOICE (as the Volvo backs out of the driveway) Remember you're required to have a lesson planned tomorrow. \nJenny laughs and waves. With the Volvo moving away up the street Jenny picks her newspaper off her walk and goes into the house. \nEXT. HILLSIDE - DAY \nThe STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire. \nArm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by, he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the highway. \nEXT. HILLSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe sun is setting over suburban Eau Claire. The colors are reflected in the STAR MAN's faceplate as he watches Jenny push a hand mower over her back yard. \nHe takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while Jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves. It turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his faceplate and speaks into it. \nSTAR MAN (subtitles) Iron channel message. Suit and rockets destroyed. Radical mixture of this atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed chemo-ion response time to adapt my body to this air. Am going to attempt extreme transformation in order to cross land mass to site of our practice landings. If transformation is not fatal, second message ball by next darkness. \nHe opens his hands and the ball rises quickly into the sky. Jenny is dumping the grass clippings into a garbage can at the side of the house when the sudden motion of the message ball catches her eye and she watches it quizzically until it disappears. \nEXT. WISCONSIN SKIES - LATE AFTERNOON \nWe are on the belly of Shermin's helicopter looking at the tree tops rushing underneath. \nINT. HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON \nShermin is standing back of Lyman and Bell who are seated in front of the square of television screens watching various shots of the wooded landscape flowing by under them. Shermin scrubs his hands over his face then bends over to stretch his back. \nSHERMIN Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow. \nLYMAN I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow. \nPause. \nMAJOR BELL I'm telling you they're probably friendly. \nLYMAN Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say... \nRADAR TECHNICIAN (loud) UFO coming out of the grass. \nSHERMIN Lock in. \nRADAR TECHNICIAN Got it. \nJENNY You're full of tricks, aren't you? \nThe car starts across the twin cities' bridge. \nJENNY (taps the fuel gauge) We need gas. \nThe STAR MAN looks at the gauge. Jenny scrunches against the door to avoid contact with him. \nJENNY No gas. \nSTAR MAN No gas. \nJENNY This car runs on gas. \nShe presses the accelerator to the floor. The car jumps forward. \nJENNY Gas... \nShe takes her foot off the accelerator and the car quickly slows down. \nJENNY No gas. \nEXT. BRIDGE - AFTERNOON \nJENNY (V.O.) Gas. \nThe Mustang spurts forward a few yards. \nJENNY (V.O.) No gas. \nIt staggers down to a crawl. \nJENNY (V.O.) Gas. \nThe car leaps forward again. \nJENNY (V.O.) No gas. \nIt drops back to a crawl. \nINT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON \nJENNY No gas... car dead. (her head lolls forward on her chest) We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas. \nSTAR MAN Gas good? \nJENNY Yes. Very good. \nINT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON \nWe are LOOKING DOWN Jenny's arm AT a gas station just off Interstate 169 in the Minneapolis suburbs. \nJENNY Gas... \nThe STAR MAN contemplates the station as they pass it, then turns to Jenny, puzzled: \nSTAR MAN Go. \nJENNY It's closed... closed. We need one that's open. \nSTAR MAN Closed? \nJENNY You'll see. \nThere are no more gas stations in sight. The STAR MAN becomes bored with the silence. He picks up Jenny's wallet. The driver's license is familiar so he flips to the next window. In it is a picture of an older man and woman standing in front of a church. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJENNY (snaps) Not what. Who. What is for things. (touching the steering wheel, dashboard, seat, gear shift) What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he? (points to the man in the picture) Who is she? (points to the woman) Who are you? (points to the STAR MAN) Who am I? \nShe touches her chest. \nSTAR MAN (mirrors her gestures) Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? (pause; it clicks for him and he points at Jenny) Who are you? \nJENNY I am Jenny Haydn. \nSTAR MAN (flips back to her license and reads) Jennyhaydn. \nJenny nods. \nJENNY Who are you? \nSTAR MAN I am... \nWe HEAR MODULATED CLICKS of his percussive LANGUAGE. \nJENNY That's a big help. Where are you from? \nSTAR MAN From? \nEXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON \nJenny gets out of the car. When she straightens up, she finds the STAR MAN staring at her over the roof. She slams the door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies' room. Stuffing the green pouch in his pocket, the STAR MAN trots after her. \nJENNY (wheels on him as he catches up) Go back to the car. \nThe STAR MAN looks at her but doesn't move. Jenny snarls in frustration, then with the STAR MAN on her heels, stalks to the ladies' room and throws open the door. \nINT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON \nThe STAR MAN follows Jenny inside. \nJENNY See. It's a bathroom. I'm not trying to escape. I just have to go to the bathroom. \nHe checks out the stall. \nJENNY Satisfied? Now get out. Out. \nSTAR MAN No. \nFurious, Jenny steps around him and opens the door. She points to the sign on it. \nJENNY Women... me. \nShe continues out. The STAR MAN goes after her. \nEXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON \nJenny points to the sign on the next door. \nJENNY Men. You go in here. \nShe cracks the door for him. \nJENNY Come on. \nHe takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look inside. Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies' room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the gallons and the cost of the gas. \nEverything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image. The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture. \nThe SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his feet. \nHe is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better look and mutters something to himself in his language. The rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings himself stiffly out of the seat. \nRIDER Do I need a key for the head? \nATTENDANT It's open. \nWithout taking off his helmet, the Rider sets out for the men's room. \nRIDER (over his shoulder) Fill it up. \nATTENDANT You got it. \nThe rider's approach frightens the STAR MAN. He backs up to the ladies' room door and knocks. There is no answer. He tries the knob. With the other hand he inches the gun slightly out of his pocket. \nINT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON \nJenny is bent over the sink dabbing nail polish around the corners of a paper towel. Her head snaps around to look at the doorknob. It holds. \nJENNY Just a minute. \nEXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON \nThe STAR MAN tenses and forces a smile as the Rider passes in front of him. A VOICE comes from behind the faceplate. \nRIDER Howdy... can't get her out. \nSTAR MAN (thru the smile) Gas. \nRIDER I know how she feels. \nThe rider enters the men's room. As the door closes behind him, the STAR MAN's face falls and he knocks frantically on the ladies' room door. Jenny opens it under his knuckles. He blocks the doorway and she backs up as he steps inside. \nINT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON \nThe STAR MAN looks around. Jenny's eyes widen at what is happening behind him. The pneumatic arm above the door is pulling it shut to reveal her paper towel pasted to the back. The message on it, written in red lipstick, reads: KIDNAPPED GOING W ON 169 JADE MUS. LIC#PXV237. \nJENNY (stepping around him) It's still a toilet. Hasn't become a ballroom. \nShe tries to swing the door open and hide her message against the wall, but she is too slow. The STAR MAN sees it and steps forward to read. \nSTAR MAN Kid-nap-ped... go-ing W o-n... \nJenny realizes he doesn't know what it means. \nJENNY (on her way out) That's very good. \nOther graffiti on the door helps convince the STAR MAN Jenny's message has nothing to do with him and after a last look at it, he follows her. \nJENNY (finally) Horses. \nSTAR MAN (without looking at her) Horses. \nJenny TURNS ON the RADIO and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN STATION. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJENNY Music. \nIt is pleasing to him and he listens for a while, then reaches in his pouch and takes out one of the dusty gray marbles. He rolls it between his palms. It changes to a glowing gold as it grows to the size of a baseball. \nJENNY (alarmed) What are you doing?! \nThe STAR MAN brings the globe close to his mouth and speaks into it. \nSTAR MAN (subtitles) Iron channel message. Transmute was successful. Have captured one of them. It is taking me to the pick-up point in a land vehicle. (eyeing Jenny) I think I can control it by mastering its language, which is primitive and easy to learn. Will arrive on time. Wait for me. \nThe STAR MAN opens his hands and, to Jenny's astonishment, the ball rises quickly and seeps through her roof without leaving a trace. \nEXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT \nThe Mustang swerves violently, then straightens itself as the ball comes through the roof and surges into the sky. \nEXT. SKY - NIGHT \nUnexpectedly, Shermin's helicopter storms into view. It is so close we can count the rivets. As it clears, we go to: \nINT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nThe flow of traffic on the Interstate below is being fed into the six television screens from infrared cameras on the belly of the craft. The image on the screen under the master begins to move and ends in a close-up of a green Mustang. It's not Jenny's. With a buzz the red dot appears and Fox's face interrupts the view of the Mustang. \nFOX (V.O.) I just came from a meeting with the Security Council and (the picture breaks up, but the voice continues) in view of the extraterrestrial's radical change and the fact that all our efforts (the picture re- assembles) to contact its ship remain unanswered, it was decided to issue a ten state 'all points bulletin' for Scott Haydn, Jenny Haydn and the green Mustang. The officers have been instructed not to approach the people or the vehicle but to contact you. You will then move in and contain the subjects. \nShermin rubs his hands over his face while he digests this. \nSHERMIN (sorting it out) You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over... \nFOX (V.O.) I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk. \nSHERMIN I don't like it, George... \nFOX (V.O.) Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed? \nSHERMIN It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed... \nFOX (V.O.) We don't know what else to do. We need results. \nSHERMIN (accepting) You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay. \nFOX (V.O.) I'm gonna be here if you need anything. \nHis image is replaced by one of the highway. \nMAJOR BELL They're gonna let some local cop blow him away. \nLYMAN Save us all a lot of trouble. \nMAJOR BELL Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool. \nLYMAN Bullshit! \nMAJOR BELL You have no conception of this, do you? \nLYMAN You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that? \nSHERMIN Are you ladies through?... \nBell and Lyman look at their feet. \nSHERMIN Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature. \nLYMAN Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow. \nSHERMIN (to Bell) Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed? \nMAJOR BELL No... I guess we never thought it would happen. \nIt's Shermin's turn to look at his feet. \nSHERMIN Terrific. \nOn one of the screens behind him the camera has picked up a lighted billboard advertising 'Kellogg's Corn Flakes' with its slogan 'HAVE A GREAT DAY.' \nEXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING \nJenny's Mustang is barreling along well over the speed limit. As it PASSES US, we PAN WITH it TO a sign: SLOW FOR INTERSECTION. \nEXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING \nJENNY I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you. \nThe STAR MAN is unyielding. \nJENNY Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car. (she hands him some money) That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go. \nSTAR MAN (taps the red dot on the satel compass) When we get here. \nJenny slams herself angrily back in the seat. \nJENNY You bastard. \nHer upper lip trembles and, in spite of herself, she might cry. The STAR MAN sees the center lane is open. He checks his side mirror and drifts over, only to be caught by a light. The car is still rolling when Jenny makes her move. She throws open the door and, by the time the STAR MAN turns around, she is out and running. \nSTAR MAN Jennyhaydn! \nHe takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car lurches into the cross traffic. He clambers back behind the wheel, regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the other car waiting at the light. \nEXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY \nOver her shoulder, Jenny can see the Mustang coming. She dodges up a brick walkway toward a J.C. Penney shopping mall. The Mustang skids to a stop at the curb. The STAR MAN jumps out in time to see Jenny push her way past a stream of pedestrian traffic and enter the mall. He leaves the car and zigzags through the people in that direction. \nINT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY \nAs he barges in, the STAR MAN accidentally knocks a cup of Coke out of a YOUNG MAN's hand. \nYOUNG MAN Hey!! \nIn a panic to find Jenny, he continues jostling past people to look in the shops that border the atrium. \nMEZZANINE \nJenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. Below her the STAR MAN comes out of a record store. She turns away and gets on the escalator to the second floor. \nON THE GROUND FLOOR \nThe STAR MAN thinks he sees Jenny in an electronics store, but when the girl turns around, it is obviously not her. Backing out of there, he knocks over a sandwich board advertising a restaurant. The LOUD THWACK it makes when it hits the cement turns faces in his direction. \nJenny's is not among them. His eyes raise to the mezzanine. Maybe she's there. He looks wildly around for a way up. He spots the escalator and, trying to keep the upper floor in view while he runs for it, he slams into an unattended pram. \nIt begins to tip over. The BABY INSIDE SCREAMS. The STAR MAN manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the floor. He is looking for a place to put it when the MOTHER comes charging out of a plant store. \nMOTHER My baby!!! He's stealing my baby! Burt!! \nThe STAR MAN holds the baby out to her. \nShe grabs it out of his hands and he turns to leave. \nMOTHER Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was stealing my baby!! \nTwo tough-looking MEN in T-shirts step in to block the STAR MAN's way to the escalator. \nMAN Where you think you're going? \nNot understanding, the STAR MAN tries to get by them. They push him back. \nSTAR MAN Please. \nA tall, skinny blond man with spectacles elbows his way to the Mother. \nMOTHER He was trying to steal Gloria. \nTwo steps and Burt is on the STAR MAN. He spins him around. \nBURT Is that right? Huh? \nHe throws him back against the crowd that has gathered. \nSTAR MAN (stutters) Please. \nBurt pulls the STAR MAN up by his shirt front and shakes him. \nBURT Is that right? Come on. Answer me. \nFear erases the STAR MAN's tenuous grasp of English and he begins to jabber in his own language. This makes Burt even madder. \nBURT Were you trying to steal my baby? Huh? Answer me! \nSTAR MAN Jennyhaydn! \nSECOND FLOOR \nJenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor when she hears her name. She knows she shouldn't but she gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. From there, she can see the STAR MAN trapped in a circle of people. He clubs Burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the mob. \nSTAR MAN Jennyhaydn! \nOne of the T-shirts throws him back and Burt begins to punch him. We MOVE IN UNTIL we are CLOSE ON Jenny's face. \nGROUND FLOOR \nJENNY Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take... (bends back second portion of ticket) ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'... \nSTAR MAN (impatient) 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike? \nJENNY You want this ticket? \nSTAR MAN Yes. \nJENNY Then don't be smart. \nP.A. SYSTEM (V.O.) Last call for bus 33 to Vermillion, Sioux City and Omaha... loading at Gate 3. \nJENNY That's your bus. (picks up the map and folds it) When you get to Las Vegas, ask the driver. 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.' \nSTAR MAN (falling into step next to her) 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.' \nJENNY (hands him the map) You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike... (stops in the middle of the waiting area to illustrate) You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this... \nJenny takes a few sweeps at an imaginary highway with her thumb. The stares this pantomime draws make the STAR MAN more nervous about the bus trip than he already is. \nJENNY Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride. \nSTAR MAN The car will stop? \nJENNY (continuing toward the loading platform) Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen... \nThe STAR MAN stops. \nSTAR MAN When do I get to Lathrop Wells? \nJENNY Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and... \nJenny pushes open a glass door to: \nEXT. LOADING PLATFORM - DAY \nJENNY ...you'll have plenty of time to get to where you want to go. \nThe STAR MAN hangs back when he sees the security guards. \nJENNY Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on. (gives him ticket) Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it. \nSTAR MAN Can I have the gun? \nJENNY No. \nShe maneuvers him into the end of the line. \nJENNY You might need this. \nShe takes some of the paper money out of her wallet and stuffs it in his pocket. \nJENNY Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay. \nSTAR MAN (nervous) Yes. \nThe line moves forward a step. \nJENNY Well... I'm going to go now. \nSTAR MAN Go? \nJENNY Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... (takes his hand) Goodbye. \nSTAR MAN Goodbye. \nHe watches her walk away. \nSTAR MAN Jennyhaydn. \nJENNY Yes? \nSTAR MAN Please stay. \nJenny comes back and takes his hand. \nJENNY I'll stay till you get on the bus. \nA family of four climbs aboard and the line moves up. The STAR MAN is alert to everything happening on the platform. Jenny sneaks him an affectionate look. No one in front of him has baggage to check and they move quickly past the DRIVER until the STAR MAN is next in line. \nDRIVER Ticket? \nThe STAR MAN hands the Driver his ticket. The Driver rips out the first coupon and hands it back. \nJENNY See? You're going to be okay. \nWhen they stop at the door, she impulsively kisses him on the cheek. \nJENNY Goodbye. \nLYMAN Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter. \nEXT. INTERSTATE 29 - DAY \nThe Mustang cruises along between fields of corn. \nJENNY (V.O.) Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth? \nSTAR MAN (V.O.) It was a mistake. \nINT./EXT. MUSTANG - DAY \nThe following conversation will be played over various views of Americana: a station wagon load of kids, waving and laughing, lovers kissing at a bus stop, billboards, car lots, a dog taking a leak against a tree, cheerleaders practicing on a football field, a funeral cortege, a telephone repairman up on a pole. \nJENNY You thought we were a different planet?! \nSTAR MAN No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and... \nJENNY Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.' \nSTAR MAN We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars. \nJENNY You did? That's funny. So did we. \nSTAR MAN Yes? \nJENNY Yes. \nSTAR MAN We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship... \nJENNY The captain... \nSTAR MAN The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed. \nJENNY Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend? \nSTAR MAN I don't understand 'friend.' \nJENNY A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with... \nSTAR MAN He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship. \nJENNY The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us. \nSTAR MAN I understand. \nJENNY Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home. \nSTAR MAN What is hell? \nJENNY It's bad. \nSTAR MAN He will. \nPause. Jenny feels the STAR MAN staring at her. She turns to look at him. His gaze doesn't waver. She looks back at the road, then back at the STAR MAN. \nJENNY What are you doing? \nSTAR MAN Are you my friend? \nJENNY Yes. \nSTAR MAN (smiles) I am your friend. \nEXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT \nJenny's Mustang is whipping west out of Lincoln, Nebraska. We HEAR A JUMBLE OF RADIO STATIONS as the SELECTOR is RUN THROUGH THE FREQUENCIES. \nINT. MUSTANG - NIGHT \nJenny is driving. The STAR MAN finds a RELIGIOUS STATION ON the RADIO. \nPREACHER (V.O.) (on radio) God is your creator. God is your master. God is you savior. God is the only reason that you exist. If God... \nSTAR MAN (during the above) Who is God? \nJenny is tired. She doesn't want to get into that. \nJENNY Nobody knows. \nSTAR MAN Why? \nJENNY I don't know. \nThe STAR MAN lets it drop and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN STATION. \nSTAR MAN I like this music. \nJENNY I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying? \nINT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT \nSECOND DRIVER All anybody knows is that they're armed and dangerous. \nIn the office, he can see Jenny and the STAR MAN leave the counter and head for the door. He raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes for a good head-on look at them. \nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS \nWe SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN come out of the motel office. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe Second Officer lowers the glasses and looks down at the telex pictures of Jenny and the STAR MAN taped to the dashboard. \nSECOND OFFICER Be a piece of cake for us to take 'em. \nINT. LEAD PATROL CAR - NIGHT \nTHROUGH the WINDSHIELD, we can SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN approaching the Mustang. \nTHIRD DRIVER National Security folks should be here any minute. Let them take care of it. That's what they get the big bucks for. \nEXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT \nSTAR MAN I want a drink. May I have two quarters? \nAt the passenger door, Jenny sets her purse on the car roof to take out her wallet. \nJENNY (handing it to him) You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you. \nSTAR MAN On the radio they say it's good. \nJENNY Hurry up. \nOver her purse she notices the patrol car facing her from the restaurant parking lot. There is certainly nothing unusual about a patrol car in a restaurant parking lot. She shrugs it off and gets in the Mustang. \nINT. MUSTANG - NIGHT \nJenny's behind hasn't even hit the seat before she sees the patrol car parked on the frontage road off to her left. She looks at the STAR MAN. He's busy pounding on the drink machine. She turns around to check the lot behind her and spots the patrol car there. \nSTAR MAN (coming to the car with a drink can in each hand) The machine gave me two. Should I put one back? \nJENNY No. Get in. \nSTAR MAN (rounding the hood) You can have one. \nJENNY (as he gets in) I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer. \nThe STAR MAN stiffens when he sees the patrol car on the frontage road. \nSTAR MAN Are you angry at me? \nJENNY No. I'm just not tired. Let's go. \nEXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT \nThe Mustang moves toward the frontage road. \nINT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT \nSECOND DRIVER (as the Mustang rolls onto the frontage road) They made us. Let's get 'em. \nEXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT \nAll three patrol cars jam on their rack lights and, with their SIRENS HOWLING, peel out after Jenny and the STAR MAN. \nINT. MUSTANG - NIGHT \nAt the SOUND, the STAR MAN snaps his attention to the rear view mirror. It's ablaze with police lights. He tromps on the gas. \nJENNY No. \nINT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nShermin is patched into the Nebraska Highway Patrol and is listening to the pursuit. \nEXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT \nThe Mustang careens down the on-ramp and squeezes into the traffic a hair's breath ahead of an 18-wheeler. This cuts off the patrol cars momentarily, but the Mustang doesn't have the speed to stay ahead of them. Using the other cars on the road as shields, the STAR MAN dodges from lane to lane trying to keep the police from coming alongside. \nINT. MUSTANG - NIGHT \nThe lead patrol car feints forward on the STAR MAN's side. The STAR MAN sways over to cut it off and the middle patrol car slips in next to Jenny. The STAR MAN grabs the gun from under the seat. \nJENNY No!!! No!!! \nINT. MIDDLE PATROL CAR - NIGHT \nDRIVER He's got a gun!! \nStanding on the rim of the gorge, the STAR MAN sees the rays of his pursuers' flashlights choking off any possible escape. He eases Jenny to the ground behind a boulder. She whimpers with the pain. \nSTAR MAN (strokes her cheek) You will be all right. \nHe stretches over the top of the boulder and scatters FOUR SHOTS at the lights. \nEXT. TREES - NIGHT \nThe patrolmen, the technicians and Shermin all hit the ground and kill their lights. \nSHERMIN Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt you. Put down your gun and come out. We just want to talk to your friend. \nTHE STAR MAN AND JENNY \nThe STAR MAN peers around the boulder. At that instant the searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash across the men in the field. He sees that their guns are drawn and pointed in his direction. The STAR MAN pulls back and takes a marble from his pouch. It grows and glows gold as the STAR MAN rolls it between his palms. When it reaches the size of a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and EMPTIES the .45 toward Shermin and the police. This time, there is a BARRAGE OF ANSWERING FIRE. \nWith the BULLETS RICOCHETING around him, the STAR MAN lifts Jenny to his shoulder. He massages the golden orb until it becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss. \nEXT. ABYSS - NIGHT \nThe upward thrust of the ball supports their fall and under its glow they begin a slow descent to the other side of the river. Above them, the helicopter dips back and locks its searchlight on the shelf of boulders they just left. \nEXT. PLAIN - NIGHT \nThe STAR MAN sets down with the smoothness of a man stepping off an escalator. He looks over his shoulder. The helicopter is still concentrating its spotlight on the ridge. He speaks to the ball in his language. \nSTAR MAN (subtitles) Iron channel message. Almost caught by pursuers. This may hinder escape. Wait for me. \nHe lets the ball go and, with even more velocity than the others, it zips into the sky. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT \nA WOMAN in a Frederick's of Hollywood negligee lets a TRUCK DRIVER out of one of the Winnebagos parked to the side of the main building. \nWOMAN Don't forget to tell the boys where you had a good time. \nDRIVER (calling back to her) You weren't that good. \nHer rusty laugh follows him into the parking lot. He walks between the trucks to a semi which has half of a pre-fab mobile home tied onto its flat-bed. The polyethylene that covers the open side of the house flaps in the WIND at the lower corner next to the cab. The Driver opens his door. He takes out a staple gun and refastens the dark green plastic to the house frame. \nINT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT \nIn the middle of the empty bedroom, the STAR MAN tries to cushion Jenny against the sudden JOLTS made by the semi as it lumbers out of the parking lot. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT \nWith the Driver taking it smoothly through the gears, the semi picks up speed. \nINT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe STAR MAN moves Jenny into a rectangle of moonlight shaped on the floor by a high, wide window and strips off her blouse. \nThe cold light marbles Jenny's skin and makes the blood from her wounds appear black. With her blouse, the STAR MAN wipes away the blood on the right side of her head and neck. He finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in her neck. He concentrates on her cheek and we can SEE the glow of his brain through his human skin. \nA bit of the white light comes out of his forehead. It tumbles across to Jenny's cheek and settles into the wound. The STAR MAN watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly for an instant, then dies. The flesh left behind has been closed without a scar. \nA larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into what's left of the gash. With that area suffused in a healing glow, he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck. He sends two pieces of light plunging into the wounds. Immediately, they spread into halos which we can SEE radiating from under the skin. \nOut of the night comes a LONG BLAST ON the AIR HORN and the STAR MAN has to steady Jenny as the truck swerves around something in the highway. \nWhen it settles back into its ride, the STAR MAN wipes the blood off Jenny's shoulder. The beams of the passing cars through the plastic catch the fatigue on the STAR MAN's face as he works over Jenny. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT \nWith its pre-fab house, the semi rumbles through Julesburg, Sterling and Ft. Morgan. By the time it gets to Denver, dawn is beginning to color the tips of the Rocky Mountains. \nINT. HALF HOUSE - DAWNBREAK \nIt's still dark in here. With a chunk of light in his left hand, the STAR MAN dabs at the last of Jenny's wounds, leaving behind a phosphorescent bandage. More of these patches glimmer up and down her right side. He checks her over to see if he's missed a wound. He hasn't. \nHe covers her with his windbreaker and, exhausted by his efforts, sits back against the wall. He waits to see that Jenny is sleeping comfortably, then presses the palms of his hands together. The satel compass appears between them. The green dot tells him he is still on course. \nEXT. INTERSTATE - SUNRISE \nColorado Highway PATROLMEN are dropping orange fluorescent cones across two of the three westbound lanes to form a roadblock. The sound of a harmonica draws us to Shermin's helicopter parked in a meadow beside the road. \nEXT. HELICOPTER - SUNRISE \nAs the radio technician plays the harmonica, Lyman clangs down the steps and bends to wake Shermin who is sacked out under the fuselage. \nSHERMIN Tell him I'm not here. \nLYMAN I did. \nShermin sighs and rolls over on his back. He looks terrible. \nSHERMIN Get me a radio. At least I won't have to look at his face. \nA passing car TAKES US TO the STAR MAN as he runs along the shoulder to a maroon and white '57 Chevy that has pulled off to pick him up. \nEXT. '57 CHEVY - DAY \nA swarthy, bald MAN with hairy arms leans across the seat. \nMAN Where are you going? \nSTAR MAN Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English. \nMAN Hop in. \nINT. '57 CHEVY - DAY \nMAN (re-entering the flow of traffic) I can only take you to Grand Junction, but you'll have a better chance to get a ride from there. \nThe STAR MAN smiles. \nMAN Where you from? \nThe STAR MAN starts to point to the sky, then catches himself. \nSTAR MAN I don't understand. \nMAN Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch? \nThese are foreign words to the STAR MAN and he pastes on his smile. \nMAN Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living? \nSTAR MAN (pretending) I don't understand. \nMAN I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?' \nSTAR MAN No. \nCOOK (MAN) Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money. \nSTAR MAN I understand. \nCOOK What do you do? \nSTAR MAN (searches for an answer, then) I make maps. \nCOOK Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it? \nSTAR MAN Eh... yes. \nCOOK Make any money? \nSTAR MAN No. \nCOOK (takes a pack of Camels out of his pocket) You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it. \nHe sticks a cigarette in his mouth and flips one up for the STAR MAN. \nCOOK Smoke? \nThe STAR MAN takes it, quickly examines it, then positions it in his mouth at the exact angle the Cook did. His eyebrows raise when the Cook flicks his Bic and puffs an ash on the end of his cigarette. \nThe butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches back before allowing the Cook to singe his Camel. He copies the Cook's puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to glow. \nCOOK She wants to become a doctor. She's a bright kid. Hard worker. I think she'll make it. But the damned inflation's driven the tuition up so high it makes it real tough on a family like ours. \nThe Cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke at the windshield. The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation, then chokes. His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries to be cool and not cough. The Cook takes no notice of his struggles. \nCOOK I got two other kids. I don't know what we'll do when they get old enough for college. \nSmoke starts to dribble out of the Star Man's nose and mouth. Puzzled, he re-examines his cigarette. \nCOOK Everybody blames it on the oil crisis. That might be where it starts. But I think a lot of people are just using that as an excuse to rip the rest of us off. I see it every day in the kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon cans. The price has gone up three times in the last year. And now the cans are only half full. \nThe Cook takes another drag. As if etiquette required it, the STAR MAN hurries to copy him. This time there are no ill effects. \nCOOK Do you have children? \nSTAR MAN No. \nCOOK They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything. \nThe Cook flicks his ash out of the window. A moment later, the STAR MAN mirrors his action. \nCOOK What do you think of America? \nSTAR MAN It is beautiful. \nEXT. ELMO'S - DAY \nA truck stop set back as little as the law allows from the BUZZ OF INTERSTATE 70. \nSHERMIN This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn? \nINT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH \nJENNY I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home. \nJENNY No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nThe Technician hands Shermin a note which reads: ELMO\"S TRUCK STOP/ABOUT 30 MILES EAST. \nJENNY (V.O.) I only called to tell you I was free and not to shoot anybody I was with if you see me. \nShermin jabs his thumb upward, indicating that the helicopter should lift off. \nSHERMIN Is the man who kidnapped you there now? \nJENNY (V.O.) I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home. \nSHERMIN (his hand over the mouthpiece) Get a highway patrol unit over there. \nEXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY \nShermin's helicopter lifts off. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) Mrs. Haydn, I'm going to have to ask you to stay where you are. \nINT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH \nA sharp rap on the glass startles Jenny and she turns around to see her ride. \nOLDER MAN Ready? \nJenny holds up a finger that asks for a moment longer on the phone. \nJENNY (into phone) Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again? \nSHERMIN (V.O.) Marc Shermin. \nJENNY Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) Do you know what you were kidnapped by? \nPause. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) Mrs. Haydn... \nJENNY He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells? \nThis hits Jenny like a kick in the stomach. She leans her head back against the wall. Her ride is pacing outside the booth. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) What's he planning to do in Lathrop Wells? Is he meeting someone there? \nJenny smashes the receiver back in its cradle and throws open the door. \nJENNY (on her way past the weathered driver) I changed my mind. Thanks. \nShe rushes down the hallway to the dining area where again she stands just inside the entrance. \nJENNY (at the top of her lungs) It's me again... \nThe place goes quiet except for a smattering of laughter. \nJENNY I need a fast ride west. \nINT. PORSCHE - DAY \nThe speedometer reads 90. The driver, a bespectacled, pimply- faced SIXTEEN YEAR OLD, shifts into fifth gear. Jenny is harnessed in the passenger seat. Chatter from a CB under the dash COMPETES WITH ROCK N' ROLL ON THE TAPE DECK. \nJENNY You sure this is your car? \nTEENAGER (with a stutter) My grandmother's rich. \nJENNY (as they come up on a station wagon) Slow down, slow down. \nTEENAGER Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going. \nBut he downshifts. The Porsche is going a mere 80 when they pass the station wagon. \nJENNY (peering at its occupants) I told you I'm looking for someone. \nTEENAGER In the cars, too?! \nJENNY I don't know where he is. \nTEENAGER Fly. \nJenny gives him a withering look. \nTEENAGER The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way. \nJENNY Pull over. I've got to get back there. \nTEENAGER Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody. \nJENNY It's easier not to tell if you don't know. \nEXT. INTERSTATE - DAY \nThe Porsche slows to a stop on the shoulder. \nTEENAGER (as Jenny opens the door) Wait. Could I have your autograph? \nJENNY Sure. \nShe leans back and gives the startled Teenager a kiss on the mouth, then gets out. \nTEENAGER I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you. \nJENNY Don't worry. I'll be all right. \nShe closes the door. The Teenager takes a last look at her before pulling back on the highway. Jenny waits for a car in the slow lane to go by, then runs across to the line and waits for cars in the fast lane to go by. \nINT. ROADRUNNER - DAY \nThe STAR MAN spots Jenny standing on the line peering into the on-coming cars for signs of him. He becomes agitated and his mouth begins to move soundlessly. There is a break in the traffic and Jenny dashes to the center divider. The STAR MAN leans across his driver and yells as the Roadrunner plunges by her. \nSTAR MAN JENNYHAYDN!!! \nEXT. INTERSTATE - DAY \nJenny spins around to see the Roadrunner skid to a stop on the shoulder and the STAR MAN get out. A motorcycle bombs by. He starts across the lanes of traffic toward Jenny. A truck blasts past him in the slow lane. He is buffeted into the fast lane. Jenny runs down the center divider to meet him. A VW honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it swerves around him. He reaches the safety of the center divider. Jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head against his chest. He stands there uncomfortably not knowing how to respond to this human emotion. \nSTAR MAN I told you goodbye. Why are you here? \nJENNY The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back. \nSTAR MAN This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back. \nJENNY The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on. \nShe grabs his wrist but he hangs back. \nSTAR MAN If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me. \nJENNY Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise. \nSTAR MAN I will go. But not you. \nJENNY You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did. \nSTAR MAN I don't want you to be hurt. \nJENNY Come on. \nHolding the STAR MAN's hand, Jenny pulls him toward the road. \nJENNY I didn't ask to come along on this trip, but I sure as hell am going to be the one to say when I get off. \nThey bolt across the lanes of traffic to the other side of the road where she flags down an old black pickup truck. She says something to the driver and she and the STAR MAN climb into the back. As the truck returns to the highway, the CLACK OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER OVERPOWERS the TRAFFIC SOUNDS. \nEXT. SKY - DAY \nShermin's helicopter slices around a pine-dotted peak following the twists of Interstate 70 below. In the near distance, we can SEE the roadblock. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nUnnoticed by Shermin or the Technicians, the black pickup passes off the television screens carrying their quarry east. \nSHERMIN (into headset) Any sign of either of them yet? \nThe roadblock appears on the television screens. \nEXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY \nLyman, wearing a headset plugged into a belt pack, is walking down the line of cars. \nLYMAN I don't think they're going to show. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nA swift kick from Shermin sends a stool clanging into a bulkhead. The Technicians won't meet his eyes when he turns back to them. \nSHERMIN Okay. Tell the highway patrol to block all major arteries off 70 from here to Elmo's. \nJenny and the STAR MAN are following the tracks to an abandoned boxcar. \nINT. BOXCAR - DUSK \nThe STAR MAN climbs in and pulls Jenny after him. Jenny is shivering badly. \nJENNY Can you close the door? \nThe STAR MAN scrapes it forward. He activates the satel compass which lights the interior of the boxcar. While he is doing this Jenny turns her back to him and takes off her jacket. Her teeth chattering, she tries to wring the water out of it. \nSTAR MAN You are cold. \nJENNY You're damn right I am. \nSTAR MAN I do not get cold. \nClutching the windbreaker to her breasts, Jenny looks at the STAR MAN over her shoulder. It doesn't take her long to make up her mind. \nJENNY (crossing to him) Open your shirt. \nShe waits while he struggles with the buttons. After two she brushes away his hands and undoes the rest. She lets the windbreaker drop and, slipping her arms around his waist, presses her bare chest against his. \nJENNY (savoring it) Oh, you're warm... put your arms around me. \nThe STAR MAN does and Jenny jumps as the wet sleeves touch her back. \nJENNY Take your shirt off. \nIt is difficult with Jenny around his waist, but he manages. He drapes his arms over her. She snuggles into him. The RAIN POUNDS ON THE ROOF. Gradually, Jenny responds to the STAR MAN's warmth and relaxes. She lifts her head off his chest and looks at him. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJENNY Nothing. \nShe brushes her lips against his. The STAR MAN's not sure what's happening. But he's not offended. Her next kiss is full and long. He accepts it with his eyes open and when she eases back he leans in for more. Jenny responds. As if on command, the satel compass comes from around behind the STAR MAN to hover in back of Jenny. He takes it between his palms and extinguishes it. \nINT. BOXCAR - MORNING \nJenny awakens and looks around. The STAR MAN is not with her. As she stands up she hears his VOICE OUTSIDE. He is speaking to something in his language. \nShe goes to the door to find out what and sees him standing beside a fenced-in pasture talking to the horses inside. \nEXT. PASTURE - MORNING \nJenny joins the STAR MAN at the fence. \nJENNY Good morning. \nSTAR MAN Horses. \nJENNY You don't forget anything, do you? \nSTAR MAN No. \nJenny pets one of the horses on the nose. \nJENNY (to the horse) Hello... hello. How are you this morning? \nSTAR MAN Do they talk?! \nJENNY (laughs) No, they don't talk... We talk to them. \nSTAR MAN I understand. \nAn appaloosa nudges her way through the others to the fence. \nJENNY Oh, you're pretty... \nSTAR MAN I gave you a baby last night. \nShocked, Jenny looks at him from around the appaloosa's nose. The STAR MAN is combing a horse's mane with his fingers and he doesn't see her expression. \nSTAR MAN (meaning the horses) They are beautiful. \nJENNY Yes, they are. \nSTAR MAN You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. (turns to face her) You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one. \nJENNY (shakes her head 'no') But... \nSTAR MAN It will be human and it will look like this. (touches his face) But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have. \nJENNY I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby. \nSTAR MAN You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now. \nJenny comes over and puts her arms around the STAR MAN. \nJENNY I want it. \nSTAR MAN Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know. \nJENNY The cook again? \nSTAR MAN (stepping up to the 'Super Jackpot') Yes. \nJENNY If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass. \nThe STAR MAN pops a gleaming silver dollar into the machine, pulls the handle and places his hands against the metal. Jenny, knowing it can't work, but hoping that it will, stands back and gnaws on her thumb. Then she sees the blue haze vibrating out of the STAR MAN's palms. Jenny stifles a scream. She looks around to see if anybody else has noticed. They haven't. The STAR MAN smiles at her. The force field does it's work. A picket line of 7's fills the view window. Amid the jangle of bells and flashing lights that accompany a winner Jenny doesn't know whether she should jump for joy or hide her face. \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK \nA dot in the distance becomes a brand new Camaro. As it blasts away from under us we see a paper license in its back window. The cabin light is on inside the car. \nINT. CAMARO - DUSK \nIn the passenger seat the STAR MAN is riffling through a Columbia \"History of the World.\" A Webster's Dictionary is on the dash in front of him. Wedged between his legs and the transmission well is a shopping bag full of money. \nJENNY It'll tell you pretty much everything about us... \nSTAR MAN This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this. \nJENNY Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary. \nSTAR MAN I understand. \nJENNY It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything. \nSTAR MAN (chuckles) Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions. \nJENNY What will you say about us? \nSTAR MAN I will say that we can be friends. \nJENNY We can. \nShe notices the green ring on her left hand and takes it off. \nJENNY This is yours... \nSTAR MAN If you want to keep it, you can. \nJENNY I'd like to... \nShe slips it back on her finger above her wedding band. They drive in silence. The STAR MAN sets the history book on the dash. \nJENNY (takes the ring off again) Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby? \nSTAR MAN You want the baby to laugh at me. \nJENNY Yes. \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK \nWith the STAR MAN SINGING IN HIS LANGUAGE, the Camaro moves further into Death Valley. The SONG FADES and we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe Camaro blows by a gas station, closed for the night. \nINT. CAMARO - NIGHT \nThe STAR MAN shifts restlessly in his seat as he searches the ghostly landscape for something familiar. He activates the satel compass. The red and green dots are touching. \nJENNY How long will it take you to get home? \nSTAR MAN (absently) Many, many days and nights... \nHe presses the satel compass into his palms. \nJENNY Would you like to listen to some music? \nThe STAR MAN shakes his head \"no.\" \nJENNY I'm sure we could find a country and western station. \nSTAR MAN No, thank you. \nJenny takes his hand in hers. \nJENNY Don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. \nThe STAR MAN smiles wanly at her. \nJENNY (leans forward to look up at night sky) Which star is yours? \nIt only takes the STAR MAN an instant to find his home. \nThe STAR MAN shaves the rubber off the electrical lines leading into the fuse box and clips two wires of his own onto the exposed copper. With Jenny watching we have a montage of the STAR MAN working through the night: modifying the insides of the Black and Decker drill, cutting out the mid- section above the trigger, fitting electrical components into that area, screwing a pipe into the bit-clamp, welding it together with the spark that arcs between the electrical wires. \nINT. OFFICE (GAS STATION) - NIGHT \nJenny folds a sheaf of money into a sheet of yellow paper and props it on the cash register. 'For Damages. Thank You' is scribbled on the front. She runs out to catch the STAR MAN who is on his way to the Camaro. \nEXT. CAMARO - NIGHT \nCarrying the modified Black and Decker drill the STAR MAN opens the driver's door. \nJENNY Where do you think you're going? \nSTAR MAN Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now. \nJENNY I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye. \nINT. CAMARO - NIGHT \nBoth hands on the wheel, Jenny is burning down the center line. The STAR MAN bends two thin wires trailing out from the grip of the drill. Jenny winces as he buries them into the flesh on either side of his left wrist. The car skates around the corner of a low hill. They can see that the Cobra is still sitting next to the road. \nJENNY (glancing at the modified drill) I hope that works. \nThe STAR MAN is lost in concentration. \nJenny kills her lights and glues the accelerator to the floor. Three MEN scramble from the helicopter with M16s. A BURST OF SLUGS RIPS THROUGH the Camaro's WINDSHIELD. The STAR MAN leans out the passenger window and with an other-worldly scream, fires. The helicopter is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS. The concussion throws the men to the ground. \nEXT. BURNING HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nThe Camaro whizzes through the falling DEBRIS. \nINT. CAMARO - NIGHT \nJENNY It works. \nThe STAR MAN slumps in exhaustion and pain. \nSTAR MAN I do not know how many times I can do this. \nINT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nIt is filled with the radio voices of the Cobra crews setting up to attack the Camaro. \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe Camaro becomes airborne at the crest of a dip. Only its new shocks save the landing. \nINT. CAMARO - NIGHT \nThe STAR MAN draws the satel compass out between his palms. The green dot now covers the right half of the red dot. He presses his palms together and looks past Jenny at the rugged foothills. \nThe first light of day is starting to color the sky behind them. Jenny and the STAR MAN are startled by the DRUMMING WHOMP OF A HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN looks out the window for its source. He can't see anything. The SOUND FADES. In a moment, it is REPEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR and AGAIN IT FADES. \nSTAR MAN If my ship is not here, we are in trouble. \nThis is a truism that Jenny doesn't want to hear and she flexes her fingers on the wheel. \nSTAR MAN (points at a distinctive cone peak) That's where we landed last time. Right under that mountain. \nJenny and the STAR MAN steady themselves for the last leg of their journey. Suddenly, their silence is exploded by a COBRA dropping out of the sky in front of them. Its searchlight bangs into their faces and, with its thirty-calibre MACHINE GUNS BLAZING, it comes straight at them. \nJenny yanks the Camaro onto the shoulder. The SLUGS CHEW UP the asphalt beside it. She fishtails back onto the road. A SECOND COBRA surprises them from the STAR MAN's side. Its MACHINE GUN KNOCKS OUT the BACK WINDOW before he can FIRE. \nThe STAR MAN crawls over his seat and arranges himself in the hole that was the back window to meet the Cobras' next FIRING RUN. It doesn't take them long. The first two have been joined by a THIRD. They swoop down on the Camaro. \nINT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nThe gunsights lock on the car below. The CO-PILOT squeezes the trigger. \nEXT. CAMARO - NIGHT \nSHOTS THUMP INTO the trunk in front of the STAR MAN and he FIRES. The lead HELICOPTER ERUPTS, raining pieces of hot metal over the desert floor. The other helicopters are jarred out of their run and their BULLETS harmlessly KICK UP SAND on the shoulder. Before they can regroup, the STAR MAN BLOWS THEM OUT OF THE SKY. \nJENNY In front!!! In front!!! \nThe STAR MAN has to hang on as Jenny dodges the car out of the path of a Cobra skimming over the highway toward them. As it goes over, he is able to get off a SHOT directly INTO its UNDERBELLY. The BALL OF FLAME almost engulfs the Camaro. \nINT. CAMARO - NIGHT \nThe STAR MAN slumps down into the back seat breathing hard. Jenny looks over her shoulder at him and is shocked at the strain that shows on his face. \nJENNY Hang on. \nShe throws the car into a skid and leaves the blacktop for a dirt road winding between two low hills. \nEXT. DESERT - NIGHT \nAt the base of a sandstone cliff, the Camaro slides to a stop. Jenny helps the STAR MAN out. She supports him as they struggle toward the protection of the boulders. Fox's Cobra roars over the hill. \nINT. COBRA - NIGHT \n", "test1_input": "Holding her with his eyes he grasps one of Jenny's hands and lifts it up to look at it. \nHe raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between his thumb and forefinger. \nJenny lets out a blood-curdling scream and strikes out at him. Flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she hits. The ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she sprints up the stairs. \nThe STAR MAN recovers and starts after her. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJenny gets there two steps ahead of the STAR MAN. She slams the door in his face and locks it. With him POUNDING ON THE OUTSIDE, Jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats. \nThe POUNDING STOPS. It takes her a moment to hear the silence. When she does, she whirls toward the door expecting the worst, but it remains closed. She waits. All she can hear is the sound of the rain. She intensifies her search. \nJENNY (hysteria creeping into her voice) It's got to be here... it's got to be here... \nShe finds it in the pocket of a down jacket. The Army issue .45 looks big in her hand. She releases the safety and, with a wary eye on the door, reaches for the phone on the night table next to the bed. \nLong before the receiver gets to her ear, she can hear the \"BLEET\" caused by the PHONE BEING OFF THE HOOK for so long in the living room. She hangs up and walks around the bed to sit on the corner facing the door. In the distance, we can HEAR the THUMP OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER. After a moment's indecision, Jenny gets up and releases the lock. Again she waits. \nNothing happens. With the gun ready, she turns the knob and opens the door a crack. The hallway is empty. She kicks off her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nJenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet. She looks in the bathroom. The STAR MAN isn't there. She decides to go downstairs. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe STAR MAN isn't in the living room. Jenny sidles along the wall for the front door. At the archway to the den a hissing sound stops her. She peers around the molding. The spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination. \nThe STAR MAN is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back to her. He is naked. A dot of light is HISSING around his head. The shadows in the room make it difficult for Jenny to tell exactly what is going on. \nPointing the .45 at the STAR MAN, she steps into the room for a better look. The floor creaks and the STAR MAN turns to her. Jenny shudders at what she sees. The STAR MAN is holding an 8x10 color photograph of Jenny and a man in his mid-twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits. \nThe dot of light is copying the man's features onto the STAR MAN'S translucent head. The top two-thirds of the face is already done. Everything is perfect, even the eyes. Jenny begins to tremble and lowers the gun. \nJENNY (in a small voice) No... please don't... \nShe sags against the armchair, racked by sobs that are drowned out by the FLAP OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN, with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek, gets up and takes the gun from her. \nHe drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of the helicopter NOW DIRECTLY OVER THE HOUSE. THROUGH THE WINDOWS, we can SEE the searchlight scouring the hillside next to the back yard. \nThe STAR MAN returns to the picture and resumes his transformation. He completes the chin, then continues downward weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over the entire body. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CLEAN ROOM (HOUSTON) - NIGHT \nWe come down an electrical cord that ends in a micro-phone, then down further to DR. BERGEN, a tall thin balding man in his late fifties dressed in the medical equivalent of a contamination suit. \nDR. BERGEN The creature was hit three times... \nUsing a laser light indicator Dr. Bergen shows us where. \nDR. BERGEN ...the arm, the abdomen and the upper chest, the one in the chest being the cause of death. It shattered, for want of a better term, the creature's backbone. It's not really, because it's not jointed. It's simply a hollow shaft of very pliable silicate material, as is its entire endoskeleton. The creature seems to have tremendous regenerative powers. Although it must have died within minutes of receiving the fatal wound, the arm and abdomen wounds are almost totally healed and the bullet here... (indicates with the light) has begun to dissolve... \nINT. SMALL RECTANGULAR ROOM - NIGHT \nFox, another CIVILIAN and two MEN in uniform are watching the autopsy on a bank of screens which show Dr. Bergen, the room and various close-ups of the dead extraterrestrial lying on a white glass table lit from underneath. \nDR. BERGEN It has veins but no blood. We think, and this is just speculation, that some form of energy flows from the brain, which is much more sophisticated than ours, throughout the rest of the body... We don't think there is any danger of bacterial contamination. Our biochemistries are too different... \nINT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nShermin and his crew are glued to the monitors, watching the autopsy from Houston. \nDR. BERGEN (V.O.) The flesh is gelatinous, the skin is very porous and very moist. This is another guess, but it probably comes from a planet that receives only reflected light, perhaps from a ring of moons. Its atmospheric pressure is slightly less than ours and it contains a great deal more water... \nFOX (V.O.) Dr. Bergen, George Fox here in Washington. Can you give us an idea of why they're here? \nDR. BERGEN (V.O.) They're so advanced... I... eh... can't imagine what they would want from us. I know they could be dangerous. But they could also be the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind... \nShermin and his crew share mixed reactions. \nINT. JENNY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWNBREAK \nJenny, sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her knees, is reflected in a mirror fastened to the back of the closet door. The STAR MAN edges around the door to look at himself in the glass. In baggy tan cords, a windbreaker and a plaid shirt, buttoned all the way to the neck and a button in the wrong hole halfway down the front, he looks like an innocent abroad. He notices the shirt is askew across his chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. He looks himself over. His movements resemble a human's but are noticeably more precise. \nThe clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect his face. He squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his hair to see if it is on securely. \nHe turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the bed next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. In the picture the man is dressed exactly as the STAR MAN is now. The STAR MAN picks up the gun and the pouch and, speaking to Jenny in his own language, steps to the door and motions for her to follow. Jenny consciously ignores him. The STAR MAN comes over, reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her to her feet. Jenny squirms back, but he holds her tight. She looks at the hand, almost touches it, then up at the familiar yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her. \nSTAR MAN Please... \nJENNY Don't... don't do this... please... \nThe STAR MAN gets her to her feet and hustles her out of the room. On the dresser is Jenny's wedding picture. The man the STAR MAN has become is her husband. \nINT. HOUSE - DAWNBREAK \n", "test1_true": "JENNY (struggles to free herself) You're hurting me. Stop. \nThe STAR MAN guides her into the entryway and reaches for the front door. Realizing his intentions, Jenny increases her struggle and manages to pull away. \nJENNY Oh, God, no! I'm not leaving this house with you. You're going to hurt me, I know... \nThe STAR MAN looks intently at her, then opens the front door. He taps his chest, points to Jenny and motions to the dawn outside. \nJENNY (through tears) I can't. I'd like to help. You look like Scott, but I know you're not. I don't know what you are. You gotta understand, I'm afraid of you... \nAs Jenny backs into the living room, the STAR MAN closes the door. He raises the gun, examines it quickly, then with his finger around the trigger, points it at Jenny. \nSTAR MAN Please. \nJENNY Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever... \nThe STAR MAN swings the muzzle sights across Jenny's body and FIRES. A FLOOR VASE EXPLODES. Jenny turns to look at the remains, then back to the STAR MAN. \nEXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAWNBREAK \nThe Mustang is backing out of the driveway with Jenny behind the wheel and the STAR MAN perched nervously on the passenger seat. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK \nWary of what will happen next, the STAR MAN watches Jenny move the gear selector to the drive position. \nThe car jerks forward and he grabs the dashboard to keep from toppling back in the seat. \nDuring the ride up the block, his head swivels from side to side trying to take in as much of the darkened urban landscape as he can. When the car stops at a 'stop' sign, he looks at Jenny questioningly. \nSTAR MAN Please... \nJENNY Which way do you want to go? \nShe motions ahead and he turns to look at an inter-section with streets running in three directions off of it. His eyes question Jenny again. \nJENNY You can go that way... (points left) That way... (straight ahead) That way... \nShe points right. After another look at Jenny, the STAR MAN presses the palms of his hands together, concentrates briefly, then slowly draws them apart. The force field appears between them. On it the solarized view of the United States rotates until the red destination dot is on his right. He drops his hands and points to the right. \nSTAR MAN (measured) That way. \nThe satel compass continues to hover over the dashboard. \nJENNY (staring incredulously at the compass) God, what are you? \nShe starts her right turn without looking left and fails to see a little MG approaching from that direction. The WAIL OF THE AIR HORN startles Jenny and reflexively she slams on the brakes. \nThe Mustang stalls and the MG squeals around them. Jenny checks the STAR MAN. He has pressed himself against the passenger door. The gun lies on the seat next to him. They both look at it. The STAR MAN recovers and picks it up. \nJENNY (starting the engine) I'm sorry... \nThis time when Jenny puts the car into drive, the STAR MAN is ready for the acceleration. The car completes the turn and the compass rotates to its new heading. Looking at it from this angle, Jenny suddenly recognizes it for what it is: an aerial view of the United States. \nJENNY That green dot, that's us, isn't it... and the red's where you want to go?... You don't understand me, do you? \nThe STAR MAN looks at her uncomprehendingly. \nJENNY (to herself) I gotta get out of here. \nEXT. STREET - DAWNBREAK \nThe Mustang cruises through the industrial section of Eau Claire. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK \nThe STAR MAN is watching Jenny drive. A set of headlights rushes TOWARD US in the other lane. Jenny twists around to follow the car as it goes by and we SEE the desperation on her face. \nWhen she returns her attention to the road, she sneaks a glance at the STAR MAN to see if her action has given away her state of mind. His expression hasn't changed. Jenny takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Uttering a phrase in his own language, the STAR MAN touches the steering wheel. \nJENNY (startled) What? \nSTAR MAN (thinking the steering wheel is called 'what,\" he repeats) What. \nWith the same phrase in his language, he points to the 'gear shift.' \nJENNY (realizing her mistake) Ah... no... \nSTAR MAN (repeats) Ah no. \nHe points to the dashboard. Jenny senses there is going to be a great deal of misunderstanding if she uses more words. She shakes her head 'no' and touches the steering wheel. \nJENNY (enunciates) Steering wheel... \nSTAR MAN (correcting her) What. \nJenny shakes her head 'no.' \nJENNY Steering wheel. \n", "test1_id": 321, "test2_input": "STAR MAN (repeats) Steering wheel. \nJENNY (points to the gear shift) Gear shift. \nSTAR MAN Gear shift. \nJENNY (slaps the dashboard) Dashboard. \nSTAR MAN Dashboard. \nJenny sees a police car creeping across the intersection ahead of her and interrupts the lesson to stare at it. The STAR MAN looks to where she is looking. \nSTAR MAN (alarmed) What?! \nJENNY Eh... police. \nSTAR MAN (remembering) Police... \nHe raises the gun off his lap. Jenny tries to distract him. \nJENNY (raps on the steering wheel) What?... \nWith his eyes on the police car the STAR MAN ignores her. \nJENNY Steering wheel... (she points to the gear shift) What? \nThe STAR MAN is intent on the police car. Jenny gives up trying to distract him. The patrol car passes out of their view. The STAR MAN lowers the gun and looks at Jenny. \nSTAR MAN (unprompted, points correctly at each item) Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard... \nJENNY (this frightens Jenny even more) Good. \nSTAR MAN Good. \nEXT. INTERSECTION - DAWN \nWe COME DOWN FROM a red light TO FIND the Mustang stopped behind the limit line. \nJENNY (V.O.) Which way? \nSTAR MAN (V.O.) That way. \nThe light changes and the car proceeds straight across the intersection. \nSTAR MAN (V.O.) Good. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAWN \nWhile the STAR MAN picks through the contents of the glove compartment, Jenny looks for a way to escape. An all-night laundromat is a possibility, but it's deserted. The STAR MAN finds the switch on a flash-light and flicks it on and off. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJENNY (distant) Flashlight. \nHe puts the flashlight in his lap along with the owner's manual and gas slips and takes a stack of Discount Coupons out of the glove compartment. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJENNY Coupons. \nJenny sees a set of headlights turn into the oncoming lane. She slides her eyes toward the STAR MAN. He is busy looking through the Coupons. Jenny measures the distance between the Mustang and the oncoming lights. The STAR MAN holds up one of the Coupons and points to a picture of the product. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJENNY (curt) Pancakes. \nSTAR MAN Pancakes. \nHe points to the cluster of letters that spells SAVE 35\u00a2. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJenny doesn't answer. The distance between the two vehicles is narrowing rapidly. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJenny sets her jaw and wrenches the steering wheel violently to the left. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nThe Mustang skids sideways across the center line. The oncoming van jams on its brakes and swerves to its left. Locked in a skid, it drifts toward the Mustang. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAWN \nThe STAR MAN sucks himself back in terror as the van descends on him. It swings past his window and clips the rear fender of the Mustang. Both vehicles shudder to a stop. Jenny claws at her door. It swings open. She is halfway out before the STAR MAN manages to grab the tail of her sweatshirt. Jenny begins to scream at the top of her lungs and keeps it up while he tries to wrestle her down on the seat. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nA tall, raw-boned MAN in his late twenties storms around the front of his van. \n", "test2_true": "He kicks the Mustang. \nJENNY (screaming) Help me!! \nMAN You could have killed us both!! \nJENNY (battling to maintain her grip on the door frame) He's kidnapping me!!! \nThe Man bends down to look at the struggle. \nMAN Jesus Christ!! You crazy people... \nJENNY Call the police!! \nMAN (not sure he wants to get involved) Hey buddy... let her go... \nThe STAR MAN increases his efforts and Jenny loses her grip on one of the door frames. \nJENNY Help me!!! \nMAN (grabbing her other arm) Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on. \nThe STAR MAN frees his right hand and blindly searches the floor for the gun. He comes up with it and, shoving the barrel in the Man's face, barks a harsh command in his language. The Man freezes and Jenny stops struggling. It's suddenly very quiet on the street. \nMAN Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry... \nJENNY He doesn't understand... just walk away... \nThe STAR MAN claps a hand over her mouth. \nMAN I promise I'm not going to tell anybody about this... None of my business... I'm going to move now, okay... (takes a step to one side) You guys want to fight, that's up to you... (takes another step) I'm leaving now... I won't say a word... \nHe keeps his eyes on the STAR MAN until he reaches the back of the Mustang, steals a quick look at the license plate, then blots for his van. The STAR MAN takes his hand off Jenny's mouth and slams her back into her seat. Uttering an expletive in his language he points the gun in her face and keeping it there indicates the red dot on the satel compass floating undisturbed above the dashboard. \nSTAR MAN Go. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nThe Mustang moves back into the correct lane and continues on. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAWN \nJENNY Could you put the gun down? \nThe STAR MAN just stares at her. She points to the gun. \nJENNY Gun... Down... Down. \nSlowly, he lowers it to his lap. \nJENNY Thank you. \nEXT. ABANDONED LOGGING CAMP - EARLY MORNING \nShermin's helicopter is taking on fuel from an Army tanker truck. The pilot and co-pilot are catching forty winks on the grass next to the old bunkhouse. \nINT. HELICOPTER - EARLY MORNING \nMajor Bell, bleary-eyed and unshaven, is huddled in front of the television screens eating a breakfast off a styrofoam plate. On the top left screen is a satellite picture of Northern Michigan and half of Wisconsin taken with a Doppler radar. \nOn the lower left screen is an infrared view of the same area. Over both these views is a schematic of the state boundaries and major cities. On the screens to the right of these views are blow-ups of smaller sections of the overview. \nLyman and the radar technician are asleep on the floor. Seated in front of the radio console Shermin is going through the telex messages. Next to him the radio technician is bent over the desk with his head in his forearms. \nSHERMIN There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident. \nMAJOR BELL It was only an accident that we discovered them. \nSHERMIN I know, but... \nShermin continues on through the messages. Bell asks the computer to change the pictures on the screens. Rhythmically, a sequence of images appears and disappears. \nSHERMIN You married, Major? \nMAJOR BELL Twenty-eight years. \nSHERMIN To the same woman? \nMAJOR BELL (smiling) Yes. \nSHERMIN I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday. \nBell stuffs his breakfast plate into a garbage bag and goes to get a breath of fresh air in the open doorway. Shermin stops at a point on the telex sheet. He reads the message to himself again. \nSHERMIN How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet? \nMAJOR BELL (after trying to imitate them) It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it? \nSHERMIN Listen to this. (paraphrasing the telex) A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'... \n", "test2_id": 322, "test3_input": "MAJOR BELL It was a man though... right? \nSHERMIN The police think he was high on drugs... \nBell shrugs. \nSHERMIN What do you think? \nEXT. WISCONSIN FOREST - EARLY MORNING \nWith a rush the helicopter rises out of the trees and thunders away. \nEXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - MORNING \nThere are Eau Claire police cars on the street. Shermin is out back watching Bell pick his way down the hill. Through the windows we see uniformed policemen in the living room. \nMAJOR BELL (slides the last few feet down the hill) Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything. \nSHERMIN It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman. \nThe man standing next to her in the picture was her husband and the witness said that was the guy who kidnapped her. \nMAJOR BELL It's the right area, that's for sure. \nThroughout the above, Shermin has noticed a WOMAN in the house next door peeping through her blinds at the activity around Jenny's. She closes the drapes suddenly when she realizes Shermin has spotted her. \nSHERMIN Why the clicking language though? \nEXT. NEXT-DOOR HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nShermin knocks and waits on the steps with Bell for someone to answer. We hear a chain being pulled off and the door is opened by a freckled-face MAN in his late thirties, dressed in a business suit and wiping the traces of a breakfast from around his mouth. \nSHERMIN Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's been some trouble next door. I'd like to ask you a few questions. \nMAN What happened? \nSHERMIN There's a possibility that Mrs. Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping you might have seen something. \nA WOMAN in a robe opens the door a little wider to include herself in the conversation. She is as freckled as the man and about the same age. \nWOMAN (to the Man) I told you... \nMAN Judy, that's stupid. \nWOMAN Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car. \nMAN You know that's impossible! \nWOMAN I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times. \nMAN (giving up on his wife and addressing Shermin and Lyman) Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral. \nShermin and Bell exchange a glance. \nEXT. INTERSTATE - DAY \nJenny's Mustang is sailing through the beautiful Wisconsin farmland. \nSTAR MAN (V.O.) R-r-S-s... \nINT. MUSTANG - DAY \nThe STAR MAN is copying the letters, upper and lower case, from the Owner's Manual he found in the glove compartment, onto the back of an envelope. \nSTAR MAN T-t-U... \nHe draws the upper case but has to check the manual for the lower case. \nSTAR MAN u-V-v... \nThe STAR MAN looks up as they go by a farm. \nSTAR MAN (pointing correctly to the various animals) Cow... Dog... Pig... \nHe looks to Jenny for confirmation. She nods absently. He returns to the alphabet. \nSTAR MAN W-w... \nHe forms both the upper and lower case 'X-x' and shows them to Jenny. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJENNY (knows what's coming) X... \nWithout smiling the STAR MAN opens his mouth and emits a short chirping laugh. \nJENNY What's so funny about X? \nThe STAR MAN laughs harder. Jenny watches him warily. He starts to hiccup. He is unable to control it through the laughter. \n", "test3_true": "INT. SMALL RECTANGULAR ROOM - DAY \nShermin's image waits on the television screen. He is gaunt, tired and visibly shaken. The picture sizzles and breaks up intermittently. Fox and the three men who watched the autopsy stride quickly into the room. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) (his voice quavering) George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial. \nFOX (after a beat) When can we expect containment? \nSHERMIN (V.O.) Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang... \nFOX (very controlled) It's in a green Mustang? \nSHERMIN (V.O.) Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere. \nMILITARY MAN (to the room) This one has a weapon. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) No, no... A .45, it probably got it in the woman's house. They were last seen in downtown Eau Claire... \nFOX Why did you let it get into a populated area? \nSHERMIN (V.O.) It's taken on a disguise. \nFOX Clarify that. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband. \nStatic breaks up the t.v. picture. When it returns, Fox leans toward the screen. \nFOX Repeat the last item. \nAlmost reluctantly Shermin holds up Scott Haydn's picture. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) The extraterrestrial now looks like this. \nFOX (softly) Oh shit!!! \nEXT. INTERSTATE - AFTERNOON \nJenny's Mustang moves along through the traffic. \nINT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON \nWe are CLOSE ON the back of a ten-dollar bill. \nSTAR MAN (O.S.) (reading slowly) The United States of America. In God We Trust. Ten dollars. \nWe pull back as he holds the ten up to Jenny. \nJENNY Money. \nSTAR MAN Money. \nHe holds up a quarter. \nJENNY Money. \nConfused, the STAR MAN puts the money back into Jenny's wallet and reads the first card through its plastic window. \nSTAR MAN Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money? \nJENNY (shaking her head 'no,' exhausted) We're going to have to stop for gas soon. \nUnder the license is a picture of Jenny smiling broadly. The STAR MAN looks at Jenny, back at the picture, then imitates the smile for Jenny. \nSTAR MAN What? \nJENNY Smile. \nSTAR MAN Smile... good? \nJENNY Yes. \nHe practices curling the corners of his mouth up into a smile. One of them freezes as the Interstate curves and a glistening skyline backlit by the afternoon sun comes into view across a river. \nSTAR MAN (impressed) What?! \nJENNY Minneapolis. \nSTAR MAN (reaching into the leg pouch he took from his life-support suit) Minneapolis... Minneapolis... \nJENNY What are you doing? \nHe takes out his camera. \nJENNY ...What's that? \nHe points the white disc at Minneapolis. With a 'POP,' a cone of light flashes out. It sucks back, almost instantly, bringing with it a three-dimensional image of the skyline. \nSTAR MAN Minneapolis... good. \n", "test3_id": 323}

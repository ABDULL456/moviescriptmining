{"test1_input": "\"STARMAN\" \nScreenplay by \nBruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon \nwith Dean Riesner (uncredited) \nDRAFT SCRIPT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nA frightened SECURITY GUARD is tensed forward off the back seat, his hands clutched into the fabric between the two regular POLICE OFFICERS in front. \nGUARD (an edge of fear in his voice) It's coming up... Slow down... (he points out between them) There, right there... \nThrough the windshield we can see the headlights pick up a billboard announcing a 'new' housing development. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and starts up a rutted dirt road. The sign tells us we are headed for 'Pinewood Estates,' a housing development financed by the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nThe Security Guard is becoming more agitated. He wipes a cold sweat off his brow. The blue flashers reflect off the fog onto the faces of the men. Suddenly the Security Guard lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren. \nOFFICER (startled) Benny, God, take it easy... \nBENNY (GUARD) I don't want to scare them away. \nThe two Police Officers exchange an indulgent look. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \nUsing only its parking lights, the police car creeps up the dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nThe windows are rolled down. Periodically one of the men leans out for a better look at the terrain around them. \nSECOND OFFICER Smells smoke... \nBENNY I told you. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \nThe police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops. Above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. The men get out of the car. \nBENNY (loud whisper) There!! Up on the hill!! \nThe officer steps forward for a better look. Benny hangs on his shoulder. \nBENNY Right in line with that burning tree. \nOFFICER I don't see anything. \nBENNY It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires? \nThe officer strains to see through the fog. \nOFFICER Benny, there's nothing there. \nBENNY There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses. \nOFFICER Flew?! Oh, come on Benny... \nThe second officer is peering intently at something down among the houses. \nOFFICER You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling us... \nMIKE (SECOND OFFICER) What's that? \nBenny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing. What appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among the houses below them. Further into the track another beam of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise stationary. \nBENNY What did I tell you? \nOFFICER Probably kids. \nOne of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other side. \nMIKE (not convinced) Probably... \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nThe police officers are beginning to feel anxious. Benny's nervous fidgeting in the back seat doesn't help them any. \nBENNY Don't you think you should call a backup? \nOFFICER No, we can handle this. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \nThe police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is on. A couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills over the sides of an industrial dumpster. As we watch we hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the houses. \nINT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT \nAs a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture window, a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside. The silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen. It raises a hand to eye level. There is a sharp \"SNAP\" and a hard-edged cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside of the kitchen and pulls back a three-dimensional image of stove, sink, cupboards, electrical fixtures and walls to the silhouette. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \nThe police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road. Benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the direction of the fire on the hill. The police searchlight swings onto the house. \nOFFICER (over outside speakers) This is the police. Identify yourselves. \nIt is deathly silent. \nCarrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light. \nThe fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in and out of visual contact with each other. \nBenny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light pointing at a cement mixer. \nBENNY (to the officers, his voice cracking) There's one over here... \nThe brilliant light swings toward him. Benny, his hands trembling, raises the gun. \nBENNY Stop!! Police!! \nThe light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a couple shots. The light goes out immediately. \nMIKE (in Benny's direction) What happened? \nBENNY I think I shot one. \nMIKE Jesus, Benny. What are you doing? \nINT. FINISHED HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT \nWe are looking at the back of the humanoid figure. It crosses to a high window and looks out. The reddish tinge of the fog outlines him. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \nThe men strain to see something through the silent fog. \nOFFICER You see anything, Mike? \nBefore Mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound is heard. He pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. They stop. \nOFFICER This is the police. Identify yourselves. \nBenny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber. Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again. \nBENNY (shouts to the officers) You wanna give me some help over here. \nMIKE Okay... \nBenny continues around the house. He flashes his light into a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing off its wrist into its hands. \nAt the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the houses. \nThe officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the air, then crashes to the earth. \nOFFICER Mike, call for back-up. (shouting) Benny, you all right? \nBENNY I don't think so... (clutching his shoulder) \nOFFICER (waving the beam of his flashlight, shouts) Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look. \nBenny's beam flashes back. \nBENNY Don't leave me. I'm coming. \nThe two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets over their heads. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. As they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple to life across the skin of a saucer-shaped spacecraft resting at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. Frightened, the officers stop. \nINT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into the kitchen. An indistinct image plays on the inside of its faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive language. Through the window over the sink we can see the lights of the spaceship. \nThe rockets flip into the humanoid's gloved hands and it is airborne out the open back door. \nEXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 321, "test2_input": "Holding her with his eyes he grasps one of Jenny's hands and lifts it up to look at it. \nHe raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between his thumb and forefinger. \nJenny lets out a blood-curdling scream and strikes out at him. Flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she hits. The ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she sprints up the stairs. \nThe STAR MAN recovers and starts after her. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJenny gets there two steps ahead of the STAR MAN. She slams the door in his face and locks it. With him POUNDING ON THE OUTSIDE, Jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats. \nThe POUNDING STOPS. It takes her a moment to hear the silence. When she does, she whirls toward the door expecting the worst, but it remains closed. She waits. All she can hear is the sound of the rain. She intensifies her search. \nJENNY (hysteria creeping into her voice) It's got to be here... it's got to be here... \nShe finds it in the pocket of a down jacket. The Army issue .45 looks big in her hand. She releases the safety and, with a wary eye on the door, reaches for the phone on the night table next to the bed. \nLong before the receiver gets to her ear, she can hear the \"BLEET\" caused by the PHONE BEING OFF THE HOOK for so long in the living room. She hangs up and walks around the bed to sit on the corner facing the door. In the distance, we can HEAR the THUMP OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER. After a moment's indecision, Jenny gets up and releases the lock. Again she waits. \nNothing happens. With the gun ready, she turns the knob and opens the door a crack. The hallway is empty. She kicks off her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nJenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet. She looks in the bathroom. The STAR MAN isn't there. She decides to go downstairs. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe STAR MAN isn't in the living room. Jenny sidles along the wall for the front door. At the archway to the den a hissing sound stops her. She peers around the molding. The spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination. \nThe STAR MAN is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back to her. He is naked. A dot of light is HISSING around his head. The shadows in the room make it difficult for Jenny to tell exactly what is going on. \nPointing the .45 at the STAR MAN, she steps into the room for a better look. The floor creaks and the STAR MAN turns to her. Jenny shudders at what she sees. The STAR MAN is holding an 8x10 color photograph of Jenny and a man in his mid-twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits. \nThe dot of light is copying the man's features onto the STAR MAN'S translucent head. The top two-thirds of the face is already done. Everything is perfect, even the eyes. Jenny begins to tremble and lowers the gun. \nJENNY (in a small voice) No... please don't... \nShe sags against the armchair, racked by sobs that are drowned out by the FLAP OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN, with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek, gets up and takes the gun from her. \nHe drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of the helicopter NOW DIRECTLY OVER THE HOUSE. THROUGH THE WINDOWS, we can SEE the searchlight scouring the hillside next to the back yard. \nThe STAR MAN returns to the picture and resumes his transformation. He completes the chin, then continues downward weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over the entire body. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CLEAN ROOM (HOUSTON) - NIGHT \nWe come down an electrical cord that ends in a micro-phone, then down further to DR. BERGEN, a tall thin balding man in his late fifties dressed in the medical equivalent of a contamination suit. \nDR. BERGEN The creature was hit three times... \nUsing a laser light indicator Dr. Bergen shows us where. \nDR. BERGEN ...the arm, the abdomen and the upper chest, the one in the chest being the cause of death. It shattered, for want of a better term, the creature's backbone. It's not really, because it's not jointed. It's simply a hollow shaft of very pliable silicate material, as is its entire endoskeleton. The creature seems to have tremendous regenerative powers. Although it must have died within minutes of receiving the fatal wound, the arm and abdomen wounds are almost totally healed and the bullet here... (indicates with the light) has begun to dissolve... \nINT. SMALL RECTANGULAR ROOM - NIGHT \nFox, another CIVILIAN and two MEN in uniform are watching the autopsy on a bank of screens which show Dr. Bergen, the room and various close-ups of the dead extraterrestrial lying on a white glass table lit from underneath. \nDR. BERGEN It has veins but no blood. We think, and this is just speculation, that some form of energy flows from the brain, which is much more sophisticated than ours, throughout the rest of the body... We don't think there is any danger of bacterial contamination. Our biochemistries are too different... \nINT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nShermin and his crew are glued to the monitors, watching the autopsy from Houston. \nDR. BERGEN (V.O.) The flesh is gelatinous, the skin is very porous and very moist. This is another guess, but it probably comes from a planet that receives only reflected light, perhaps from a ring of moons. Its atmospheric pressure is slightly less than ours and it contains a great deal more water... \nFOX (V.O.) Dr. Bergen, George Fox here in Washington. Can you give us an idea of why they're here? \nDR. BERGEN (V.O.) They're so advanced... I... eh... can't imagine what they would want from us. I know they could be dangerous. But they could also be the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind... \nShermin and his crew share mixed reactions. \nINT. JENNY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWNBREAK \nJenny, sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her knees, is reflected in a mirror fastened to the back of the closet door. The STAR MAN edges around the door to look at himself in the glass. In baggy tan cords, a windbreaker and a plaid shirt, buttoned all the way to the neck and a button in the wrong hole halfway down the front, he looks like an innocent abroad. He notices the shirt is askew across his chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. He looks himself over. His movements resemble a human's but are noticeably more precise. \nThe clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect his face. He squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his hair to see if it is on securely. \nHe turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the bed next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. In the picture the man is dressed exactly as the STAR MAN is now. The STAR MAN picks up the gun and the pouch and, speaking to Jenny in his own language, steps to the door and motions for her to follow. Jenny consciously ignores him. The STAR MAN comes over, reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her to her feet. Jenny squirms back, but he holds her tight. She looks at the hand, almost touches it, then up at the familiar yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her. \nSTAR MAN Please... \nJENNY Don't... don't do this... please... \nThe STAR MAN gets her to her feet and hustles her out of the room. On the dresser is Jenny's wedding picture. The man the STAR MAN has become is her husband. \nINT. HOUSE - DAWNBREAK \n", "test2_true": "JENNY (struggles to free herself) You're hurting me. Stop. \nThe STAR MAN guides her into the entryway and reaches for the front door. Realizing his intentions, Jenny increases her struggle and manages to pull away. \nJENNY Oh, God, no! I'm not leaving this house with you. You're going to hurt me, I know... \nThe STAR MAN looks intently at her, then opens the front door. He taps his chest, points to Jenny and motions to the dawn outside. \nJENNY (through tears) I can't. I'd like to help. You look like Scott, but I know you're not. I don't know what you are. You gotta understand, I'm afraid of you... \nAs Jenny backs into the living room, the STAR MAN closes the door. He raises the gun, examines it quickly, then with his finger around the trigger, points it at Jenny. \nSTAR MAN Please. \nJENNY Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever... \nThe STAR MAN swings the muzzle sights across Jenny's body and FIRES. A FLOOR VASE EXPLODES. Jenny turns to look at the remains, then back to the STAR MAN. \nEXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAWNBREAK \nThe Mustang is backing out of the driveway with Jenny behind the wheel and the STAR MAN perched nervously on the passenger seat. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK \nWary of what will happen next, the STAR MAN watches Jenny move the gear selector to the drive position. \nThe car jerks forward and he grabs the dashboard to keep from toppling back in the seat. \nDuring the ride up the block, his head swivels from side to side trying to take in as much of the darkened urban landscape as he can. When the car stops at a 'stop' sign, he looks at Jenny questioningly. \nSTAR MAN Please... \nJENNY Which way do you want to go? \nShe motions ahead and he turns to look at an inter-section with streets running in three directions off of it. His eyes question Jenny again. \nJENNY You can go that way... (points left) That way... (straight ahead) That way... \nShe points right. After another look at Jenny, the STAR MAN presses the palms of his hands together, concentrates briefly, then slowly draws them apart. The force field appears between them. On it the solarized view of the United States rotates until the red destination dot is on his right. He drops his hands and points to the right. \nSTAR MAN (measured) That way. \nThe satel compass continues to hover over the dashboard. \nJENNY (staring incredulously at the compass) God, what are you? \nShe starts her right turn without looking left and fails to see a little MG approaching from that direction. The WAIL OF THE AIR HORN startles Jenny and reflexively she slams on the brakes. \nThe Mustang stalls and the MG squeals around them. Jenny checks the STAR MAN. He has pressed himself against the passenger door. The gun lies on the seat next to him. They both look at it. The STAR MAN recovers and picks it up. \nJENNY (starting the engine) I'm sorry... \nThis time when Jenny puts the car into drive, the STAR MAN is ready for the acceleration. The car completes the turn and the compass rotates to its new heading. Looking at it from this angle, Jenny suddenly recognizes it for what it is: an aerial view of the United States. \nJENNY That green dot, that's us, isn't it... and the red's where you want to go?... You don't understand me, do you? \nThe STAR MAN looks at her uncomprehendingly. \nJENNY (to herself) I gotta get out of here. \nEXT. STREET - DAWNBREAK \nThe Mustang cruises through the industrial section of Eau Claire. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK \nThe STAR MAN is watching Jenny drive. A set of headlights rushes TOWARD US in the other lane. Jenny twists around to follow the car as it goes by and we SEE the desperation on her face. \nWhen she returns her attention to the road, she sneaks a glance at the STAR MAN to see if her action has given away her state of mind. His expression hasn't changed. Jenny takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Uttering a phrase in his own language, the STAR MAN touches the steering wheel. \nJENNY (startled) What? \nSTAR MAN (thinking the steering wheel is called 'what,\" he repeats) What. \nWith the same phrase in his language, he points to the 'gear shift.' \nJENNY (realizing her mistake) Ah... no... \nSTAR MAN (repeats) Ah no. \nHe points to the dashboard. Jenny senses there is going to be a great deal of misunderstanding if she uses more words. She shakes her head 'no' and touches the steering wheel. \nJENNY (enunciates) Steering wheel... \nSTAR MAN (correcting her) What. \nJenny shakes her head 'no.' \nJENNY Steering wheel. \n", "test2_id": 322, "test3_input": "STAR MAN Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know. \nJENNY The cook again? \nSTAR MAN (stepping up to the 'Super Jackpot') Yes. \nJENNY If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass. \nThe STAR MAN pops a gleaming silver dollar into the machine, pulls the handle and places his hands against the metal. Jenny, knowing it can't work, but hoping that it will, stands back and gnaws on her thumb. Then she sees the blue haze vibrating out of the STAR MAN's palms. Jenny stifles a scream. She looks around to see if anybody else has noticed. They haven't. The STAR MAN smiles at her. The force field does it's work. A picket line of 7's fills the view window. Amid the jangle of bells and flashing lights that accompany a winner Jenny doesn't know whether she should jump for joy or hide her face. \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK \nA dot in the distance becomes a brand new Camaro. As it blasts away from under us we see a paper license in its back window. The cabin light is on inside the car. \nINT. CAMARO - DUSK \nIn the passenger seat the STAR MAN is riffling through a Columbia \"History of the World.\" A Webster's Dictionary is on the dash in front of him. Wedged between his legs and the transmission well is a shopping bag full of money. \nJENNY It'll tell you pretty much everything about us... \nSTAR MAN This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this. \nJENNY Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary. \nSTAR MAN I understand. \nJENNY It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything. \nSTAR MAN (chuckles) Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions. \nJENNY What will you say about us? \nSTAR MAN I will say that we can be friends. \nJENNY We can. \nShe notices the green ring on her left hand and takes it off. \nJENNY This is yours... \nSTAR MAN If you want to keep it, you can. \nJENNY I'd like to... \nShe slips it back on her finger above her wedding band. They drive in silence. The STAR MAN sets the history book on the dash. \nJENNY (takes the ring off again) Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby? \nSTAR MAN You want the baby to laugh at me. \nJENNY Yes. \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK \nWith the STAR MAN SINGING IN HIS LANGUAGE, the Camaro moves further into Death Valley. The SONG FADES and we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe Camaro blows by a gas station, closed for the night. \nINT. CAMARO - NIGHT \nThe STAR MAN shifts restlessly in his seat as he searches the ghostly landscape for something familiar. He activates the satel compass. The red and green dots are touching. \nJENNY How long will it take you to get home? \nSTAR MAN (absently) Many, many days and nights... \nHe presses the satel compass into his palms. \nJENNY Would you like to listen to some music? \nThe STAR MAN shakes his head \"no.\" \nJENNY I'm sure we could find a country and western station. \nSTAR MAN No, thank you. \nJenny takes his hand in hers. \nJENNY Don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. \nThe STAR MAN smiles wanly at her. \nJENNY (leans forward to look up at night sky) Which star is yours? \nIt only takes the STAR MAN an instant to find his home. \n", "test3_true": "JENNY Where? \nHe directs Jenny's attention to the constellation Auriga. \nSTAR MAN (meaning the star Capella) The yellow one. \nJENNY Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you. \nSTAR MAN (smiles) I will wave to you. \nAll we can HEAR are the TIRES HUMMING over the road. The Camaro rounds the side of a low hill. \nSTAR MAN Oh, shit! \nJenny slams on the brakes. One of the Cobra helicopters, lit from the inside, is parked next to a line of flares across the road ahead. \nEXT. CLOSED GAS STATION - NIGHT \nThe STAR MAN is looking through a window at the repair bay, lit by a work light. Jenny is standing in a phone shell on the front of the garage, the receiver to her ear. \nThe STAR MAN moves to the office door. He tries the knob. It is locked. \nJENNY (to the STAR MAN) They're trying to get him. \nSuddenly the STAR MAN slams his shoulder against the door. It swings open. \nJENNY What are you doing?!! \nFox's voice comes out of the receiver in her hand. \nFOX (V.O.) Mrs. Haydn... \nINT. COBRA - NIGHT \nFOX (speaking into a headset) This is George Fox... \nJENNY (V.O.) I want to speak to Marc Shermin. \nFOX You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now. \nEXT. CLOSED STATION - NIGHT \nJENNY If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up. \nFOX (V.O.) (a beat) Okay... \nTethered by the phone cord, Jenny tries to see what the STAR MAN is doing inside the repair bay. \nINT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT \nUsing an air filter top as a basket, the STAR MAN scavenges from the work bench and the car up on the lift, fuses, lengths of wire, circuit boards from a radio, tubing, metal pipe and a Black and Decker drill. While he is doing this we get glimpses of Jenny pleading his case on the phone. Finally, leaving the receiver dangling at the end of its cord, she comes around to stand in the doorway. \nJENNY Mr. Shermin wants to speak to you. \nINT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nJENNY (V.O.) Here he is. \nShermin looks warily at the headset. When the STAR MAN doesn't speak immediately, he takes the initiative. \nSHERMIN Hello... \nSTAR MAN (V.O.) I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin. \nSHERMIN We can't let you do that. \nSTAR MAN (V.O.) I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home. \nINT. COBRA - NIGHT \nFox is listening to the conversation. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you. \nSTAR MAN (V.O.) If I talk to you, I will miss my ship. \nSHERMIN (V.O.) Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George. \nFOX No deal. \nEXT. CLOSED GAS STATION - NIGHT \nSHERMIN (V.O.) I'm afraid we can't let you go. \nSTAR MAN I understand. \nHe hangs up. \nINT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT \n", "test3_id": 323}

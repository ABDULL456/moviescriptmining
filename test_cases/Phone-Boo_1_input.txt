STU Who is this? 
VOICE Someone who's watching you. 
STU Get lost! 
VOICE Love the gray suit.  That red and black tie makes a nice combination. 
Stu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel. He looks around nervously. 
STU Where?  Where are you? 
VOICE Closer than you think. 
STU I don't see you. 
VOICE There are any number of windows. Check them out. 
Indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise buildings and hotels. 
STU Okay, you had your little joke. 
VOICE I'm not sufficiently amused.  Not yet.  We have more to talk about. 
Stu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him not to.  Perhaps it's the strange tone of the man's voice. 
STU Do me a favor.  Call up somebody else. 
VOICE But it's you I'm interested in. You know how many people use that booth every day? 
STU Why don't you tell me? 
VOICE Better than two-hundred people on average. 
STU Is that what you do?  Count them? 
VOICE What else do I have to do?  It's interesting watching people. Trying to guess who they are.  And what they're up to. 
STU What are you -- a shut-in of some kind? 
VOICE You might say that.  I can't go out.  I might be seen. 
STU Somebody's looking for you? 
VOICE Desperately. 
STU The cops? 
VOICE Not yet. 
STU The ex-wife.  What'd you do -- run out on child support? 
VOICE What kind of man do you think I am? 
STU Frankly, I could care less.  You had your fun.  Now goodbye. 
VOICE It's not in your best interests to hang up on me.  That would make me angry. 
STU Isn't that just too bad? 
VOICE For you.

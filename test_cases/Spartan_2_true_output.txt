SCOTT They sent me... 
Scott looks at the pile of tobacco. He extracts the "Rogers Rangers" card from his pocket and looks at it. We read, in an insert: "Rule #13: Every night, you'll be told where to Meet, if Surrounded by Superior Force". 
ANGLE, on Scott, as he very precisely peels the card into two thin halves, and rolls one of the halves into a cigarette, using the reclaimed tobacco from the ashtray. He takes the cigarette to Laura. As a peace offering. She takes it. Beat. 
LAURA Did my father send you? 
SCOTT (as he lights her cigarette) ...that's right. 
LAURA (derisively) One man. 
SCOTT One riot, one Ranger, you ever hear that? 
ANGLE, on Scott, as he hears a car outside the window. He draws a pistol and moves to the window, and looks down. He gestures Laura to be quiet. 
ANGLE EXT. The window. In the small, deserted street. A car pulls up. A man gets out, and looks around. Beat. Another man, and a woman, and two small children come out of the low house and get into the car, which drives away. 
LAURA Leonides, the King of Sparta, when a neighboring state would beg for Military Aid. Would send One Man. 
SCOTT ...well, there you go. 
LAURA ...you ever hear that? 
SCOTT No. I think we went to different schools. 
He looks at her. Beat. She hands him the cigarette. And he takes a drag, and passes it back. He checks his watch. 
SCOTT ...put the bandana on. 
LAURA (softly) Did you hear the one about the king who turned his daughter into Gold? 
SCOTT Yeah - I heard that one. 
Beat. She turns away, and cries. 
LAURA ...I don't want to go home. 
SCOTT I didn't ask you. 
EXT. DUBAI AIRPORT. DAY. 
A long view of the airport. 
ANGLE, a small delivery van we saw earlier. Parked in an industrial area. 
ANGLE INT THE VAN. Laura, dozing in the passengers seat. Scott, sitting in the driver's seat, alert, watching. 
ANGLE HIS POV. Seen beyond the corner of an industrial building, beyond a chainlink fence, the airport. 
ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Laura wakes with a start, and looks around. 
LAURA I don't know where we are... 
SCOTT You just keep it together. 
ANGLE Scott as he looks up to the sound of a plane. 
ANGLE HIS POV. Directly over their heads, a small bizjet, on final, about to touch down. 
ANGLE, the chainlink fence. Scott and Laura at the fence protecting the airport. Scott moves aside the pre-cut section of fence, and gestures him through. 
ANGLE, inside the fence. Laura and Scott moving to the protection of a small hangar. 
ANGLE, beyond them, we see the bizjet come to a halt, on the tarmac, and turn. We see blazoned, on its side, "Global News". 
ANGLE, on Scott and Laura, now inside the small hangar. Scott moves to a small locker and extracts a set of coveralls, and a cap, and takes them to Laura. 
SCOTT (of the coveralls) You put this on. 
LAURA (groggily) ...what...? 
SCOTT You... 
A pause. He turns to the sound of a car. 
ANGLE HIS POV. A car, on the tarmac. It comes to a stop by a private plane. Beyond this private plane, we see the "Global News" bizjet, being directed to a stop. 
ANGLE, on Scott, as he watches the tarmac. 
ANGLE HIS POV. Stoddard and several of his men, get out of the car which has stopped by the private plane. A man in fatigues emerges from the plane, and hands Stoddard a piece of paper. Stoddard begins giving this man directions.

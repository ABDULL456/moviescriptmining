EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY 
Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best, flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a grenadier company.  The party are laughing together. 
RODERICK (to Captain Grogan) I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body. 
CAPTAIN GROGAN Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword. 
RODERICK I'll match any man with the sword. 
CAPTAIN GROGAN But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now. 
RODERICK Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years. 
CAPTAIN GROGAN It must have been some other gate. 
They alight from their horses, and join and salute the other gentlemen. 
CAPTAIN GROGAN I have just explained to Mister James that Captain Best is lame, and that swords are impossible. 
HARRY Oh, yes!  Dead lame. 
Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red. 
HARRY And very lucky for you, Roderick, my boy.  You were a dead man else, for he is a devil of a fellow -- isn't he, Grogan? 
CAPTAIN GROGAN A regular Turk.  I never yet knew the man who stood to Captain Best. 
HARRY Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry, Roderick.  You can easily say that. 
CAPTAIN BEST If the young feller will go to Dublin, as proposed... 
RODERICK I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize -- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as to hell! 
Grogan takes him aside. 
CAPTAIN GROGAN Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off. 
RODERICK A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize. 
HARRY (with a laugh to Grogan) There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose? 
CAPTAIN BEST (in a big voice) Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan? 
HARRY Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols. (with some emotion to Roderick) God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire. 
RODERICK This is not one of my pistols. 
HARRY They are all right, never fear. It's one of mine.  Yours will serve, if they are needed, for the next round. 
CAPTAIN GROGAN Roderick, fire at his neck -- hit him there under the gorget; see how the fool shows himself open. 
Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal. 
It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover his man well. 
Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are given. 
At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls. 
THE SECONDS (crying out) He's down!  He's down! 
Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes his head. 
MICHAEL He's hit here, in the neck. 
Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under his gorget. 
HARRY How is it with you? 
The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once more and falls backwards. 
MICHAEL (with a scowl) The young fellow has begun well. You had better ride off, young sir, before the police are up.  They had wind of the business before we left Kilwangan. 
RODERICK Is he quite dead? 
MICHAEL Quite dead. 
CAPTAIN GROGAN Then the world's rid of a coward. It's all over with him, Roddy -- he doesn't stir.

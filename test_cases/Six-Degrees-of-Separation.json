{"test1_input": "SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION \nWritten by \nJohn Guare \nApril 1992 \nINT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAWN JOHN FLANDERS KITTREDGE and LOUISA KITTREDGE (\"FLAN\" and \"OUISA\") , an attractive couple in their 40s, in their night clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of shock. Some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them. THEY survey their living room which under normal circumstances would appear to be a serene haven. But why are they-so aghast? And terrified? Has the apartment been violated? The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is filled with beautiful objects chosen with care. Even though the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern paintings hang on the walls. No. No visible disaster here. But then why FLAN and OUISA's emotional state? THEY run between the hall and the living room. \nOUISA Is anything gone? OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation. But nothing leaps out. SHE sees a mink is still there.. \nFLAW How can I look? I'm shaking. \nOUISA My god! The Kandinsky! 0UISA runs into the living room. SHE can see by the discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing. \nOUISA Y It's gone! Call the police! \nFLAN There it is! An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and brilliantly colored. \n0UISA Thank god! SHE picks the painting up and flips it around. It's a double sided painting. The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in different styles on either side of the canvas. \nOne side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other side is all chaos and brilliant colors. OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the geometric side. SHE admires it. FLAN opens the door from the hall into \nTHE OFFICE. A computer. Calendars. File cabinets. Bulletin boards with prints of paintings tacked on. FLAN checks - the slide projector is there. FLAN opens and closes cabinet drawers. OUISA appears in the doorway of the office. \nOUISA We could've been killed. \nFLAN Don't say that. The silver Victorian inkwell! FLAN runs past OUISA down the hall back to the living room. OUISA follows HIM back into \nTHE LIVING ROOM. FLAN looks on an antique table crowded with framed family photographs going way back in time and all kinds of mementoes. \nOUISA How can you think of things? We could have been murdered. \nFLAN I want to know if anything's gone? HE picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver beaver and looks at it with great objectivity.. \nFLAN There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why? OUISA, drained, looks out the window down onto Central Park. \nOUISA Slashed ---our throats slashed. Go to bed at night happy and then murdered. Would we have-woken up? OUISA screams. \nBut it's their pug dog licking her leg. OUISA picks up the dog and pets it. FLAN remembers something and buries his face in his hands. \nFLAN We have to go to the wedding. \nOUISA I am in no mood to go to any wedding. \nFLAN We have to \nOUISA They're your friends \nFLAN I beg to differ. They're Your fr - FLAN stops, frightened suddenly, listening. \nFLAN Hello? OUISA runs to HIM, terrified. HE holds HER. \nOUISA (WHISPERS) You don't call out Hello unless-- THEY walk softly to the dark hall. \nFLAN I think we could tell if someone else was here. \nOUISA We didn't all night. THEY look down the silent dark hall. \nINT THE WHITE WALL SOMEWHERE ELSE We don't know where we are yet but it's certainly not the KITTREDGE'S. The rain drumming outside and the distant thunder and the soft cool jazz playing makes the air of this room with the white wall, wherever it is, claustrophobic, even erotic. A YOUNG BLACK MAN whose name is PAUL comes into frame and leans against this white wall. Right off, you say this YOUNG MAN is a winner. PAUL frowns, then smiles. Right into the camera. \nPAUL \n(SERIOUS) Hello. \n(FLIRTATIOUS) Hello. \n(QUESTIONING) Hello? \n(SUSPICIOUS) Hello... \n(ELATED) Hello! Yes. Hello. SOMEONE OFF SCREEN claps. PAUL bows to the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE. \nEXT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING 910 FIFTH AVENUE DAY OUISA and FLAN run out of their apartment building, their clothes hastily pulled on, their faces swollen with shock. THEY run down the side street into \nTHE GARAGE. Their car is waiting - a Mercedes - FLAN slips the attendant a bill. FLAN gets in the driver's seat. OUISA gets in the passenger seat. FLAN (a statement of fact) I'm shaking. \nOUISA Then I'll drive. \nFLAN I have to hang on. \n", "test1_true": "OUISA Let's just get there \nINT THE WHITE WALL The Sound of the rain, the jazz, the thunder. \nPAUL Bottle of beer. Bottle of beer. Bottle of beer. AN UNSEEN YOUNG MAN OFF CAMERA speaks - elegant phrasing. \nVOICE Bottle of beer. \nPAUL Bottle- of beer. \nVOICE Very good. You owe me. PAUL takes off his shirt. HE's strongly built. HE throws \nthe shirt directly into the camera. \nEXT HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY DAY FLAN is driving terrifically fast. OUISA puts on a tape. MARIA CALLAS sings the death scene from La Traviata. \nOUISA Be care - ! A CAR veers by. FLAN swerves his car. \nOUISA Let me drive! \nFLAN (FURIOUS) Driving calms me! \nOUISA When you're in one of these moods you do not drive well and I do not want to be killed today. \nFLAN We could have been killed last night. \nOUISA Stop saying that! \nFLAN pulls himself together. HE moves over to the Slow lane. \nFLAN I'm driving slowly. See. Slowly. \nOUISA I went in the room first. FLAN looks for signs. \nFLAN Where's the goddam turnoff onto the Taconic? A truck veers and almost hits them. \nOUISA You didn't see what I saw! FLAN puts on brakes. \nFLAN It's that fucking Maria Callas! Turn that damn thing off! \nFLAN snaps off the tape deck. THEY resume driving. \nOUISA It's not Maria Callas. It's that truck and you. \nFLAN And last night. THE COUNTRYSIDE speeds by. \nEXT ST PETER'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH LITHGOW, NEW YORK DAY LOTS OF CARS parked in front of this sweet rural wooden chapel near Millbrook, New York. THE BRIDE, 20s, gets out of a limo escorted by her FATHER. OUISA and FLAN run up to the BRIDE and kiss her. \nOUISA Happy is the bride the sun shines on \nBRIDE (ALARMED) You look horrible! \nOUISA (BRIGHT) No no! Could've been killed. All fine! \nFATHER What? \nFLAN Wonderful wedding. Wonderful day. THEY run into \nTHE CHAPEL. This.perfect country chapel with a dozen or so rows of pews is bedecked with flowers and lit by candles. A STRING QUARTET at the side of the little altar plays Dvorak's American Quartet. THE USHER in morning clothes, greets FLAN and OUISA and shows them to their pew. \nUSHER Bride's side? Groom's side. \nFLAN Either side. I can't even remember how we met them. Why are we here? THEY walk down the aisle, heads down. \nOUISA Do not make a scene. THEY kneel. \nFLAN (WHISPER) Now I lay me down to sleep - the most terrifying words  just think of it - \nOUISA(WHISPER) I pray the Lord my soul to keep- \nFLAN (WHISPER) The nightmare part - If I should die before I wake - \nOUISA(WHISPER) If I should die - I pray the Lord my soul to take - COUPLE IN THE PEW IN FRONT turn. A MAN, A WOMAN, strangely not unlike FLAN and OUISA, perhaps A few years older, perhaps more nautical as if they'd flown a in from Nantucket, are named SANDY and CONNIE. \nSANDY Is anything wrong? \nOUISA We were almost murdered \nFLAN \n", "test1_id": 1878, "test2_input": "ELIZABETH Do you think it'll hurt me? \nRICK What'll hurt you? \nELIZABETH My resemblance to Liv Ullmann. PAUL runs into the loft. \nPAUL He wrote me! I wrote him and he _ wrote me back! He's going to give me a thousand dollars! And that's just for starters! He sold a Cezanne to the Japanese and made millions and he can give me money without her knowing it. PAUL lets out a whoop and leaps up onto the bed with RICK and ELIZABETH in it and begins jumping up and down. \nELIZABETH I knew it! PAUL goes to a corner which contains a single mattress on the floor and begins to pack his few things back in the plastic bags. \nPAUL I'm moving out of here! \nELIZABETH reaches for her robe and pulls it on. RICK pulls on his jeans. \nELIZABETH You can't! \nRICK No! RICK and ELIZABETH surround PAUL to make HIM stay. PAUL hugs THEM. \nPAUL But I am going to give you the money to put on a showcase of any play you want and you'll be in it and agents will come see you and you'll be seen and you'll be started. And when you win your Oscars - both of you - you'll look in the camera and thank me - ELIZABETH loves the moment and weeps her acceptance speech. \nELIZABETH I want to thank Paul Kittredge. \nRICK Thanks, Paul! THEY all hug each other and that's real. \nPAUL One hitch. I'm going to meet him in Maine. He's up there visiting his parents in Dark Harbor. My grandparents whom I've never met. He's finally going to tell my grandparents about me. He's going to make up for lost time. He's going to give me money. I can go back home. Get my momma that beauty parlor she's wanted all her life. One problem. How am I going to get to Maine? The wife checks all the bills. He has to account for the money. She handles the purse strings. Where the hell am I going to get two hundred and fifty dollars to get to Maine? \nELIZABETH How long would you need it for? \nPAUL I'll be gone a week. But I could wire it back to you. \nPAUL goes into the john to take his toothbrush and razor. ELIZABETH pulls on her dress and straightens out her hair. \nRICK (QUIET) We could lend it to him for a week. \nELIZABETH (QUIET) We can't. If something happens - \nRICK (QUIET) You're like his stepmother. These women holding on to all the purse strings. \nELIZABETH No. We worked too hard to save that. PAUL comes out of the john. RICK - always laid back - is suddenly quite angry. \nELIZABETH Paul. I'm sorry. We just can't. \nPAUL Look. No problem. I understand. \nELIZABETH I'll meet you both after work. If your father loves you, he'll get you the ticket up there. \nPAUL He does. It'll work out. Hey. Posture. Stand up straight. Don't slump. Attitudes of defeat. ELIZABETH kisses PAUL and looks at sullen RICK and leaves. \nSOHO LOFT \nOUISA She was one of those armies of young people who come to New York filled with dreams and end up on a treadmill working and working just to stay alive. \nINT A WEST SIDE RESTAURANT NIGHT ELIZABETH is one of the few waitresses in this crowded bar and works very hard. \nEXT CASH MACHINE NIGHT ELIZABETH gapes at the information on the screen. \nCU MESSAGE ON SCREEN \n\"ACCOUNT CLOSED\" ELIZABETH begins hitting the machine to get her card back. ELIZABETH picks up the phone on the machine and calls the emergency number. ELIZABETH (in phone) There's some mistake. It says my joint account - can you see the numbers on the screen - that's right. that's my name. And his name. Joint account. What do you mean? Closed? Who closed the account? Who took everything out of the account? Who did this! Give me my card back! THE GUY next in line nudges her. \nTHE NEXT CUSTOMER Let somebody else in here. \nEXT THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING NIGHT An hysterical ELIZABETH goes into \nTHE LOBBY. FRANK, the DOORMAN, is having a snooze. ELIZABETH shakes him. HE wakes up terrified at the sight of this hysterical creature over HIM. \nELIZABETH - people named Kittredge. This Kittredge guy has a black son he makes live in the park - \nFRANK Mr. Kittredge has what? \nELIZABETH His black son took money from me - \nFRANK You have to be quiet \nELIZABETH I want to get up to see them! \nFRANK You'll have to call or write a letter - \nELIZABETH They owe me money! \nR \n", "test2_true": "THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING. FRANK, the DOORMAN, bolts the front door to the-building. ELIZABETH bangs on the door. \nELIZABETH I'm here trying to get to meet people. I am stranded. Who do I know to go to? I want my money. I work tables. I work hard. A CAB pulls up. A POSH COUPLE steps out of the cab to go into 910 Fifth. THEY look at ELIZABETH. \nELIZABETH \"The quality of mercy is not strained?\" Fuck you, quality of mercy. FRANK opens the door quickly. THE POSH COUPLE scoots in. ELIZABETH kicks the building. \nINT ORSO'S RESTAURANT NIGHT FLAN and OUISA have come to this Broadway Italian restaurant after the theater with a MAN and WOMAN who from their dress and manner are obviously in the theater: ANDREW and ZEANNIE. FLAN and OUISA are in mid-story. \nFLAN - all over the building that I had abandoned some mistake of my past in Central Park! THE COUPLE gasps! \nJEANNIE But it's too fantastic! \nFLAN Can't you just see me marching down South for Freedom Now! \nOUISA (PROUDLY) Yes. Yes, I can. \nFLAN It was so embarrassing. \nANDREW Horrible! \nOUISA It wasn't so embarrassing. \nJEANNIE I bet Flan loves being outraged. FLAN (mock outrage) I don't! \nANDREW You do! Flan loves getting into high dudgeon! His cheeks go all rosy! Look at his cheeks! Dudgeon becomes him. THEY all laugh as the WAITRESS puts down the plates of food. \nFLAN To high dudgeon! THEY all toast. But OUISA has stopped laughing. \nINT RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TEN EME NT NIGHT ELIZABETH sits up in bed in the dark. SHE impassively watches a rat scramble across the floor. RICK comes in, drained, dressed in a baby blue tuxedo with a ruffled blue shirt - the kind of tux worn at high school proms. \nRICK (BRIGHT) Hi! ELIZABETH puts on the light. \nELIZABETH Where's the money? \nBACK IN ORSO'S RESTAURANT OUISA continues her tale. \nDUISA - she understandably wanted to know. \nRICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT RICK laughs brightly and sits beside HER on the bed. \nRICK No! Let me explain. Paul found some extra money of his own and he wanted to thank us for staying here! He would've treated you but you had to work or else we would've . We rented these tuxedos! Isn't it a gas! He's going to give us the money back! And then I'm going to take you to the Rainbow Room. That's where we went! I brought you matches! \nINT THE RAINBOW ROOM NIGHT RICK, in his ruffled blue tux, and, PAUL, in impeccable black tie, look into the Rainbow Room. THE CAPTAIN takes THEM to a table by the window. RICK and PAUL look out over the city. The view is magic! \nRICK (WHISPERS) Now did we get this table! \nPAUL Stick with me, baby. I know the right name to drop. \nRICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT RICK (laughs brightly) And it's not that expensive for what you get. Well, it's not a bargain but it's \nTHE RAINBOW ROOM THE WAITER opens a bottle of champagne. \nRICK How an I going to explain to Elizabeth about the money? PAUL tastes the champagne. THE WAITER pours. \nPAUL She'll have it back. With interest. Wonderful bouquet. Bouquet. That's what you call the taste of the wine. And I believe that wine from the even numbered years is generally the superior to the odd numbered years. Although it's just a theory - Cheers! Skol! Prosit! \nRICK You are just about the greatest - THE DANCE ORCHESTRA plays a salute to 1930's romance. \nPAUL Do you want to dance? \nRICK Elizabeth has never seen anything l_4e here. I wish she was... Who do we dance with? THE ORCHESTRA segues into a tango. PAUL stands. \nRICK We're guys. \nPAUL Every moment in life is a learning experience or what good is it? Right? Right? \nRICK Well, yes. \nPAUL Then let this bunch of jerks see class. \nORSO'S RESTAURANT FLAN nods for their dinner guests, ANDREW and JEANNIE. \nA little bit of titillation. \nFLAN They danced.

A store was selling cruelty-free cosmetics. \nINT HARVARD DORM ROOM TESS is curled up on her bed enjoying this chat. \nTESS Mother, that is such a beautiful thing. Do you realize the agony cosmetic companies put rabbits through to test eye shadow? \nA \nMASTER BEDROOM \nOUISA Dearest, I know that. I'm only talking about the phrase. Cruelty-free cosmetics should take away all evidence of time and cellulite and-- \nHARVARD DORM ROOM \nTESS Mother, I'm getting married. \nMASTER BEDROOM OUISA picks up the receiver on the cordless phone.

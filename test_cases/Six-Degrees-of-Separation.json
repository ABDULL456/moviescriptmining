{"train": "SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION \nWritten by \nJohn Guare \nApril 1992 \nINT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAWN JOHN FLANDERS KITTREDGE and LOUISA KITTREDGE (\"FLAN\" and \"OUISA\") , an attractive couple in their 40s, in their night clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of shock. Some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them. THEY survey their living room which under normal circumstances would appear to be a serene haven. But why are they-so aghast? And terrified? Has the apartment been violated? The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is filled with beautiful objects chosen with care. Even though the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern paintings hang on the walls. No. No visible disaster here. But then why FLAN and OUISA's emotional state? THEY run between the hall and the living room. \nOUISA Is anything gone? OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation. But nothing leaps out. SHE sees a mink is still there.. \nFLAW How can I look? I'm shaking. \nOUISA My god! The Kandinsky! 0UISA runs into the living room. SHE can see by the discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing. \nOUISA Y It's gone! Call the police! \nFLAN There it is! An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and brilliantly colored. \n0UISA Thank god! SHE picks the painting up and flips it around. It's a double sided painting. The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in different styles on either side of the canvas. \nOne side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other side is all chaos and brilliant colors. OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the geometric side. SHE admires it. FLAN opens the door from the hall into \nTHE OFFICE. A computer. Calendars. File cabinets. Bulletin boards with prints of paintings tacked on. FLAN checks - the slide projector is there. FLAN opens and closes cabinet drawers. OUISA appears in the doorway of the office. \nOUISA We could've been killed. \nFLAN Don't say that. The silver Victorian inkwell! FLAN runs past OUISA down the hall back to the living room. OUISA follows HIM back into \nTHE LIVING ROOM. FLAN looks on an antique table crowded with framed family photographs going way back in time and all kinds of mementoes. \nOUISA How can you think of things? We could have been murdered. \nFLAN I want to know if anything's gone? HE picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver beaver and looks at it with great objectivity.. \nFLAN There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why? OUISA, drained, looks out the window down onto Central Park. \nOUISA Slashed ---our throats slashed. Go to bed at night happy and then murdered. Would we have-woken up? OUISA screams. \nBut it's their pug dog licking her leg. OUISA picks up the dog and pets it. FLAN remembers something and buries his face in his hands. \nFLAN We have to go to the wedding. \nOUISA I am in no mood to go to any wedding. \nFLAN We have to \nOUISA They're your friends \nFLAN I beg to differ. They're Your fr - FLAN stops, frightened suddenly, listening. \nFLAN Hello? OUISA runs to HIM, terrified. HE holds HER. \nOUISA (WHISPERS) You don't call out Hello unless-- THEY walk softly to the dark hall. \nFLAN I think we could tell if someone else was here. \nOUISA We didn't all night. THEY look down the silent dark hall. \nINT THE WHITE WALL SOMEWHERE ELSE We don't know where we are yet but it's certainly not the KITTREDGE'S. The rain drumming outside and the distant thunder and the soft cool jazz playing makes the air of this room with the white wall, wherever it is, claustrophobic, even erotic. A YOUNG BLACK MAN whose name is PAUL comes into frame and leans against this white wall. Right off, you say this YOUNG MAN is a winner. PAUL frowns, then smiles. Right into the camera. \nPAUL \n(SERIOUS) Hello. \n(FLIRTATIOUS) Hello. \n(QUESTIONING) Hello? \n(SUSPICIOUS) Hello... \n(ELATED) Hello! Yes. Hello. SOMEONE OFF SCREEN claps. PAUL bows to the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE. \nEXT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING 910 FIFTH AVENUE DAY OUISA and FLAN run out of their apartment building, their clothes hastily pulled on, their faces swollen with shock. THEY run down the side street into \nTHE GARAGE. Their car is waiting - a Mercedes - FLAN slips the attendant a bill. FLAN gets in the driver's seat. OUISA gets in the passenger seat. FLAN (a statement of fact) I'm shaking. \nOUISA Then I'll drive. \nFLAN I have to hang on. \nTHROATS SLASHED THE PEOPLE in the pew in front gasp. FLAN and OUISA are serious. THE QUARTET plays The Wedding March. EVERYONE stands. THE BRIDE and her FATHER walk down the aisle. CU OUISA'S FACE lost in thought. Bright vivid colors fill the screen. Later we will learn they are from a double-sided painting by Kandinsky, which \nHANGS IN \nTHE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM. \nOUISA (VO) \nChaos. OUISA'S face appears briefly, smiling, then is replaced by dark, geometric patterns. The other side of the painting. It is lowered to reveal OUISA very serious. \nOUISA (VO) Control. (The painting is flipped.) Chaos. (OUISA smiles. Flips it again. Frowns.) Control. \nBACK IN THE CHAPEL OUISA, still frowning at her memory, realizes the wedding ceremony is over. THE BRIDE and the GROOM run up the aisle beaming at EVERYONE to the strains of Lohengrin. But even THEY slow down when THEY see the state FLAN and OUISA are in. \nGROOM Is everything all FLAN snaps out of it, putting on his party smile. \nFLAN We always get this way at weddings. THE BRIDE and GROOM resume their run up the aisle. It's FLAN and OUISA's turn to leave the pew and go up the aisle. SHE is stricken. \nOUISA I do not always get this way at weddings. \nFLAN We're alive. THEY walk up the aisle into the foyer of the chapel. SHE puts her head into his shoulder. \nOUISA Oh, it was awful awful awful awful. Then OUISA and FLAN put on their best smiles as THEY pass through a receiving line, finally shaking hands with the \nWEDDING COUPLE. \nBRIDE \nDid you say you could have been killed? \nOUISA (MERRY) Yes! Only hours ago! \nFLAN (MERRY) But we're here! \nOUISA Wouldn't miss it! THE BRIDE and GROOM look after THEM. \nEXT THE MILLBROOK GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB DAY A spankingly bright and solid country club in Millbrook New York situated on the golf course grounds surrounded by lots of tennis courts. \nINT MILLBROOK CLUB DAY THE WEDDING GUESTS file into the cheery club, all bright white and a shade of cheery green that only country clubs seem to find. MORE GUESTS than could f it into the CHAPEL are here in the club waiting for the Bride and Groom. FLAN and OUISA hesitate before going into the ballroom. \nTHEY stop in the small quiet dark clubby BAR. THEY sit at a small table, pulling themselves together. SANDY and CONNIE (the people from the pew in front of them) come up to THEM. A WOMAN who looks like a dormouse is with them. SHE is named JULIA. \nSANDY We hate to pry - \nFLAN No no. You're not prying \nCONNIE But what happened - \nSANDY This is our friend Julia \nFLAN Do we know each other? \nJULIA Oh yes through... \n9 FLAN Of course. Haven't seen them in years FLAN shakes hands with the new acquaintance. \nCONNIE We're worried for you FLAN and OUISA look at each other. \nOUISA Tell them! SANDY and CONNIE and JULIA sit down at the small table. \nFLAN We were having a wonderful evening last night. \nOUISA A friend we hadn't seen for many years came by for dinner. I don't think you know him - \nFLAN (PORTENTOUSLY) Geoffrey Miller. From South Africa-- \nOUISA Don't say it so portentously. \nFLAN (BRIGHT) Geoffrey from South Africa. \nOUISA Don't be ga-ga. (THEY give their orders to THE BARTENDER.) Something large. \nSANDY I didn't know Geoffrey was in town. \nJULIA I saw him at Susie Baxter's \nSANDY I wasn't at Susie Baxter's \nCONNIE Sandy forgets he was married to Susie Baxter. THE WAITER goes. \nSAVOY That's no reason why she can't invite me to a party. CONNIE whispers to JULIA, her eyes on FLAN. \nFLAN Geoffrey, you have to move out of South Africa. You'll be killed. Why do you stay in South Africa? \nGEOFFREY One has to stay there to educate the black workers and we'll know we've been successful when they kill us. \nFLAN Planning the revolution that will destroy you. \nOUISA sits back on the comfy sofa amazed at the thought. \nOUISA Putting your life on the line. \nGEOFFREY You don't think of it like that. I wish you'd come visit. OUISA takes her drink and strokes the ears of her dog. \nOUISA But we'd visit you and sit in your gorgeous house planning trips into the townships demanding to see the poorest of the poor. \"Are you sure they're the worst off? I mean, we've come all this way. We don't want to see people just mildly victimized by apartheid. We demand shock.\" It doesn't seem right sitting on the East Side talking about revolution. \nFLAN Only small murky cafes for Pepe le Noko here. \nOUISA No. La Passionaria. I will come to South Africa and build barricades and lean against them, singing. \nFLAN And the people would follow. \nOUISA \"Follow Follow Follow\". What's that song? \nFLAN The way Gorbachev cheered on the striking coal miners in the Ukraine - yes, you must strike- it is your role in history to dismantle this system. Russia and Poland - you can't believe the developments in the world - (HE remembers:) \"The Fantasticks\" (SINGS:) \"Follow Follow Follow\". \nOUISA China. FLAN and OUISA (despair) Oh. \nGEOFFREY Oy vay China. As my grandmother would say. Our role in history. And we offer ourselves up \nto it. \nFLAN That is your role in history. Not our role. OUISA ponders this thought. \nOUISA A role in history. To say that so easily. GEOFFREY suddenly gets up and looks through the telescope by the window. \nGEOFFREY'S POV GEOFFREY flashes down nine floors into Central Park. HE frowns in puzzlement when HE sees \nA STATUE OF AN ALASKAN HUSKY baying up into the sky. FLAN and OUISA look at GEOFFREY's back and then at each other. How to keep the ball rolling? FLAN (to Geoffrey) Do you want another drink before we-- \nGEOFFREY turns into the room. \nGEOFFREY Wonderful view. \nOUISA The phrase - striking coal miners - I see all these very striking coal miners modelling the fall fashions. \nGEOFFREY Where should we? \nFLAN There's good Szechuan. And Hunan. \nOUISA The sign painter screwed up the sign. Instead of The Hunan Wok, he painted The Human Wok. \nGEOFFREY God! The restaurants! New York has become the Florence of the Sixteenth Century. Genius on every corner. \nOUISA I don't think genius has kissed the Human Wok. THEY finish off their drinks. \nGEOFFREY The new Italian looked cheery. FLAN and OUISA Good. \nFLAN We made reservations. FLAN looks at the slide projector. \nFLAN Geoffrey, I'd like to show - FLAN'S sentence hangs in mid-air as GEOFFREY follows OUISA \nINTO \nTHE HALL. OUISA burrows in the closet getting her coat and GEOFFREY's coat out of the hall closet stuffed with tennis rackets and skis and boots. \nOUISA This restaurant - they wrap ravioli up like salt water taffy. FLAN appears behind HER to help HER. THEY both wrestle the coats out of the closet. \nFLAN Six on a plate for a few hundred dollars. And FLAN gets the coats. A clatter of tennis rackets falling. GEOFFREY takes his topcoat. \nGEOFFREY You have to come to South Africa so I can pay you back. I'll take you on my plane into the Okavango Swamps - \nOUISA Did you hear - to take back to Johannesburg. out in Eastharpton \nFLAN \nLAST WEEKEND \nOUISA a guy goes into one of the better food stores - \nFLAN Dean and DeLuca - FLAN helps OUISA on with her coat. \nOUISA one of the Dean and DeLuca look alikes. Gets a pack of cigarettes and an ice cream bar. Goes up front. Sees there's a line at the register. Slaps down two twenty dollar bills and goes out. GEOFFREY doesn't get the anecdote. \nFLAN Hello? PAUL returns with the rest of the real in brightly painted bowls. \nPAUL Seconds? THEY laugh and are served. \nOUISA Have you declared your major yet? \nPAUL You're like all parents. What's your major? \nFLAN Geoffrey, Harvard has all those great titles the students give courses. \nOUISA The Holocaust and Ethics? \nFLAN Krauts and Doubts. \nOUISA I think we're lucky having this dinner. Isn't this the finest time? A toast to you. \nGEOFFREY To Cats! \nFLAN Blunt question. What's he like? \nOUISA reaches for the bottle of wine. \nOUISA Let's not be star fuckers. \nFLAN I'm not a star fucker. \nPAUL My father, being an actor, has no real identity. You say to him, Pop, what's new? And he says, 'I got an interesting script today. I was asked to play a lumberjack up in the Yukon. Now, I've been trained as a Preacher, but my church fell apart. My wife says we have to get mbney to get through this winter. And I sign up as part of this team where all my beliefs are challenged. But I hold firm. In spite of prejudice because I want to get back to my wife. Out of this forest,back to the church... .' And my father is in tears and I say Pop, this i:. not a real event, this is some script that was sent to you. And my father says ' I' m trying it out to see how it fits on me.' But he has no life--he has no memory--only the scripts producers send him in the mail through his agents. That's his past. \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR Can it be? The CROWD listening to FLAN and OUISA is even larger. \nOUISA I just loved the kid so much. I wanted to reach out to him. \nFLAN And then we asked him what his thesis was on. \nBACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S DINING ROOM \nGEOFFREY The one that was stolen. Please? \nPAUL Well... (HE takes a deep breath and leans back in \nHIS CHAIR) A substitute teacher out on Long Island was dropped from his job for fighting with a student. A few weeks later, the teacher returned to the classroom, shot the student unsuccessfully, held the class hostage and then shot himself. Successfully. This fact caught my eye: last sentence. Times. A neighbor described the teacher as a nice boy. Always reading Catcher In the Rye. The nitwit - Chapman - who shot John Lennon said he did it because he wanted to-`draw the attention of the world to Catcher In the Rye and the reading of that book would be his defense. And young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot Reagan and his press secretary said if you want my defense all you have to do is read catcher in the Rye. It seemed to be time to read it again. \nFLAN I haven't read it in years. OUISA shushes FLAN. \nPAUL I borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine because I wanted to see what she had underlined and I read this book to find out why this touching, beautiful, sensitive story published in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of hate. I started reading. : It's exactly as I remembered. Everybody's a phoney. Page two: \"My brother's in Hollywood being a prostitute.\" Page three: \"what a phony slob his father was.\" Page nine: \"People never notice anything.\" Then on page twenty two my hair stood up. Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap. \"A deer Hunter hat? Like hell it is. I sort of closed one eye like I was taking aim at it. This is a people shooting hat. I shoot people in this hat.\" \nPAUL (CONTINUES) Hmmm, I said. This book is preparing people for bigger moments in their lives than I ever dreamed of. Then on p. 89 \"I'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw. I hate fist fights...what scares me most is the other guy's face...\" I finished the book. It's a touching story, comic because the boy wants to do so much and can't do anything. Hates all phoniness and only lies to others. Wants everyone to like him, is only hateful, and is completely self involved. In other words, a pretty accurate picture of a male adolescent. FLAN, OUISA, .GEOFFREY are transfixed. And what alarms me about that book--not the book so much as the aura about it--is this: the book is primarily about paralysis. The boy can't function. And at the end before he can run away and start a new life, it starts to rain and he folds. Now there's nothing wrong in writing about emotional and intellectual paralysis. It may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett be the great modern theme. The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For Godot--\"Let's go.\" \"Yes, let's go.\" Stage directions: They do not move. But the aura around this book of Salinger's-- which perhaps should be read by everyone ut young men---is this: It mirrors like a fun house mirror and amplifies like a distorted speaker one of the great tragedies of our times- --the death of the imagination. Because what else is paralysis? The CAMERA moves closer and closer in on PAUL. \nPAUL (CONTINUES) The imagination has been so debased that imagination--being imaginative-- rather than being the lynch pin of our existence now stands as a synonym for something outside ourselves like Science fiction or some new use for tangerine slices on raw pork chops---what an imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars! So imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative! And Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--so \nIMAGINATIVE--- The imagination has moved out of the realm of being our link, our most personal link, with our inner lives and the world outside that world-- this world we share--what is schizophrenia but a horrifying state where what's in here doesn't match up with what's out there? Why has imagination become a synonym for style? I believe that the imagination is the passport we create to take us into the real world. I believe the imagination is another phrase for what is most uniquely Is. \nJung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious. Our boy Holden says \"what scares me most is the other guy's face--it wouldn't be so bad if you could both be blindfolded\"--most of the time the faces we face are not the other guys' but our own faces. And it's the worst kind of yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself. To face ourselves. That's the hard thing. The imagination. That's God's gift to make the act of self- examination bearable. \nPAUSE. FLAN, GEOFFREY, OUISA are very moved. \nOUISA Well, indeed. \nFLAN I hope your muggers read every word. \nOUISA (chiding FLAN) \nDARLING \nGEOFFREY I'm going to buy a copy of Catcher i. the Rye at the airport and read it. \nOUISA Cover to cover \nPAUL I'll test you. I should be going. PAUL starts to go. THEY follow. THE DINING ROOM opens into \nTHE LIVING ROOM. \nFLAN Where will you stay? \nOUISA Not some flea bag. \nPAUL I get into the Sherry tomorrow morning. It's not so far off. I can walk around. I don't think they'll mug me twice in one evening. FLAN and OUISA take's PAUL's by the arm and leads him down the hall into \nTHEIR DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM. \nOUISA You'll stay here tonight. \nDINING ROOM/KITCHEN OUISA in the dining room looks at PAUL's back as HE washes dishes at the sink. Suddenly the dining room is flooded with light. FLAN has flicked on the light. \nFLAN He's in. \nOUISA He's in? FLAN parades around the table. \nFLAN He's in for two million. \nOUISA Two million! \nFLAN He says the Cezanne is a great inv1stment. We should get it for six million and sell it to the Tokyo bunch for ten. \nOUISA Happy days! Oh god! PAUL comes into the dining room. \nPAUL Two million dollars? FLAN runs into \nTHE LIVING ROOM. FLAN picks up the slide carousel and kisses it. \nFLAN Figure it out. He doesn't have the price of -a dinner but he can cough up two million dollars and the Japs will go ten! PAUL and OUISA come into the living room. \nPAUL Go to ten? Ten million? \nOUISA Break all those dishes! Two million! Go to ten! And we put up nothing? \nPAUL Nothing? \nFLAN Geoffrey sold that Hockney print I know he bought for a hundred bucks fifteen years ago for thirty four thousand dollars. Sotheby took their cut, sure but still--Two million! Wildest dreams. Paul, I should give you a commission. \nPAUL Your kids said you were an art dealer. But you don't have a gallery. I don't understand - \nFLAN People want to sell privately. Not go through a gallery. \nOUISA -\u00cf\u00bf\u00bd A divorce. Taxes. Publicity. FLAN (holding up a slide) People come to me looking for a certain school of painting. \nOUISA A modern.. Impressionist. Renaissance. \nFLAN But don't want museums to know where it is. \nOUISA Japanese. OUISA, FLAN and PAUL go down the hall to \nFLAN'S OFFICE. FLAN flicks on his computer. \nFLAN I've got Japanese looking for a Cezanne. I have a syndicate that will buy the painting. There is this great second level Cezanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce. FLAN holds up the slide. \nOUISA Wife doesn't want hubby to know she owns a Cezanne. PAUL looks at the slide. \nFLAN I needed an extra two million. Geoffrey called. Invited him here for dinner. \nOUISA Tonight was a very nervous very casual very big thing. \nPAUL I couldn't tell - \ns PAUL gives the slide very carefully back to FLAN who files it. \nOUISA All the better. 0 FLAN opens a door in the OFFICE. THE OFFICE connects to \nTHE MASTER BEDROOM. PAUL follows FLAN and OUISA into their bedroom. \nPAUL I'm glad I helped - \nOUISA You were wonderful! \nPAUL I'm so pleased I was wonderful. All this and a pink shirt. \nOUISA Keep it. Look at the time. \nPAUL It's going to be time for me to get up. \nFLAN Then we'll say our good nights now. \nPAUL Oh Christ. Regretfully. I4l1 tip toe. PAUL and OUISA follow FLAN into \nTHE HALL. PAUL goes into their daughter's bedroom. FLAN and OUISA hover in the hall. FLAN takes out his wallet. \nFLAN Take fifty dollars. \nOUISA Give him fifty dollars. \nPAUL Don't need it. \nOUISA Suppose your father's plane is late? \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR THE CHUMS hang on OUISA's every word. \nOUISA I sat in the kitchen happily doing the cross word puzzle in ink. Everybody does it in ink. I never. met one person who didn't say they did it in ink. \nBACK IN THE KITCHEN OUISA fills in a word on the puzzle. is it in ink? Then looks up. \nOUISA (VO) And I'm doing the puzzle and I see the time and it's nearly seven and Paul had to meet his father and I didn't want him to be late and was he healthy after his stabbing? OUISA puts the puzzle down and goes into \nTHE HALL. \nOUISA (VO) The hall is eighteen feet long. OUISA walks down the hall which now seems impossibly long. \nOUISA (VO) I stopped in front of the door. OUISA taps on the door of her daughter's room. \nOUISA Paul? SHE hears - what? - sounds of moaning? \nOUISA Paul?? \nPAUL (MOANING) \nYES YES \nOUISA Are you all right? OUISA opens the door to \nHER DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM. \nSHE turns on the light. SHE screams. A GUY mid 20s, buck naked except for ratty white socks, stands up on the bed. \nHUSTLER What the fuck is going on here. Who the fuck are you?! PAUL, startled,\"sits up in bed and pulls on his clothes. OUISA screams. \nOUISA Flan!! \nTHE MASTER BEDROOM OUISA shakes FLAN violently. FLAN comes to. \nFLAN What is it?! FLAN AND OUISA step out into \nTHE HALL. \nSILENCE. THEY hear their dog bark in \nTHE LIVING ROOM. THE HUSTLER, naked but for white socks, wanders around the living room picking up things. THE DOG is barking at HIM. THE HUSTLER turns and smiles at FLAN and OUISA. - \nHUSTLER Hey! How ya doin'? Nice stuff. \nFLAN Oh my God! THE HUSTLER stretches out on the sofa. \nHUSTLER Hey. I got to get some sleep-- FLAN tips the sofa, hurling the HUSTLER onto the floor. THE HUSTLER leaps at FLAN threateningly. \nOUISA Stop it! He might have a gun! \nHUSTLER (laughs) Yeah. I might have a gun. I might have a knife. THE HUSTLER raises his hand threateningly. \nOUISA He has a gun! He has a knife! THE HUSTLER chases OUISA around the room. FLAN chases the HUSTLER. THE DOG chases FLAN. PAUL,dressed, runs in to the living room, carrying THE HUSTLER's clothes which HE hurls down onto the sofa. \nPAUL I can explain. \nOUISA You went out after we went to sleep and picked up this thing? \nFLAN You brought this thing into our house! Thing! Thing! Get out! Get out of my house! FLAN picks up the HUSTLER'S clothes and opens the front door. \nTHE HUSTLER Hey! Be careful of the pants! \nFLAN Take your clothes. Go back to sleep in the gutter. FLAN flings the clothes out into \nTHE OUTSIDE CORRIDOR. FLAN pushes the elevator button. THE HUSTLER suddenly lunges at FLAN and grabs FLAN by the lapels of his bathrobe. \nHUSTLER Fuck. You! THE HUSTLER throws FLAN back violently, then picks up his clothes. OUISA runs to FLAN. FLAN gasps, catching his breath. THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens.. EDDIE, the elevator man, is startled by the sight. \nW \nOUISA is terrified as PAUL stands at the front door. \nPAUL Please. Don't tell my father. I don't want him to know. I haven't told him. I got. so lonely. I got so afraid. My dad coming. I had the money. I went out after we went to sleep and I brought him back. You had so much. I couldn't be alone. I was so afraid. I am so sorry. \nOUISA Just go. \nEDDIE Is everything all right? \nFLAN Make sure they go out! \nPAUL I can explain! \nKITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nFLAN No! We'll call! \nINT AIRPORT IMMIGRATION GEOFFREY puts the phone down on the security belt. The phone goes through radar. All the while we hear FLAN's voice. The SECURITY PERSON impassively watches the phone on the X-Ray screen. GEOFFREY picks up the phone as it slides off the band. \nGEOFFREY They're calling my plane- And again last night- \nKITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nFLAN No need to thank. See you shortly. \nINT KENNEDY AIRPORT THE GATE \nGEOFFREY The banks. \nKITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nFLAN My lawyer. \nKENNEDY AIRPORT THE GATE \nGEOFFREY Exactly. \nKITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nFLAN Safe trip. \nKENNEDY AIRPORT THE GATE GEOFFREY snaps the phone shut, sticks it in his pocket and goes into the gate. \nKITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM FLAN and OUISA look at each other in amazement. \nOUISA We're safe? As FLAN hangs up the phone we hear a car door shut as FLAN and OUISA get in their car. \nEXT THE MILLBROOK GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB DAY THE GROUP FROM THE WEDDING waves goodbye not at the BRIDE and GROOM but at FLAN and OUISA. THE BRIDE and GROOM as a matter of fact are there. \nTHE BRIDE And then? \nSANDY And then? \nOUISA That's all we know! And FLAN and OUISA drive out of the parking lot. \nINT/EXT THE CAR TACONIC PARKWAY DAY THE CAMERA pulls back to show FLAN and OUISA driving back down the Taconic Parkway. THEY are more composed now than when THEY left - and even pleased. THE RADIO plays a Bach Cantata: Gloria! THE CAMERA pulls back further to show them entering New York City via the Triborough Bridge. THE CITY looks magnificent for a moment from this vantage. \nEXT EAST 67TH STREET DAY Below us FLAN and,OUISA's car heads for the garage. OUISA's hand suddenly flies out of the car window, waving at a couple in their forties, KITTY AND LARKIN, crossing the street. FLAN honks the horn. THE CAMERA travels down to KITTY and LARKIN as they glare at the car, then smile when THEY see who it is. \nT \nOUISA Do we have a story to tell you! \nKITTY Do we have a story to tell you! \nINT PRECINCT NIGHT We cannot tell where we are yet. But OUISA and FLAN and KITTY and LARKIN lean across a desk and tell a MAN we will learn shortly is a DETECTIVE. \nOUISA Our two and their son are at Harvard together. KITTY and LARKIN are pleased about this. \nINT MORTIMER'S RESTAURANT AFTERNOON THE TWO COUPLES sit a table in this definitive East Side restaurant. \nFLAN Let me tell you our story. \nLARKIN When did your story happen? \nFLAN Last night. We are still zonked. \nKITTY we win. Our story happened Friday night. So we go first. \nLARKIN We're going to be in the movies. \nKITTY We are going to be in the movie of Cats. OUISA puts down her white wine. \nOUISA You tell your story first. \nLARKIN Friday night we were home, the doorbell rang--- \nKITTY I am not impressed but it was the son of - \nINT PRECINCT THE DETECTIVE makes notes. OUISA and FLAN You got it. \nBACK AT MORTIMER'S RESTAURANT \nKITTY The kid was mugged. We had to go out. We left him. He was so charming. His father was taking the red eye. He couldn't get into the Hotel till seven AN. He stayed with us. SHE is very pleased. \nDETECTIVE Sidney Poitier? FLAN and OUISA You got it. \nDETECTIVE Was he? \nOUISA We don't know. \nFLAN We gave him fifty dollars. \nKITTY We gave him twenty five. \nLARKIN \nS HHHH \nOUISA He picked up a hustler. \nFLAN He left. \nKITTY He chased the burglar out of our house. \nOUISA He didn't steal anything. \nLARKIN We looked and looked. \nKITTY Top to bottom. Nothing gone. THE DETECTIVE closes his notebook. \nOUISA Granted this does not seem major now. \nDETECTIVE Look. We're very busy. \nFLAN You can't chuck us out. \nDETECTIVE Come up with charges. Then I'll do something. \nINT THE MORGAN LIBRARY NIGHT FLAN and OUISA have come to a charity do featuring a string quartet playing Schubert Trio in B flat. But FLAN and OUISA are not entranced by the music. THEY stand at the back of the room by the bar telling their story to a GROUP of fascinated FRIENDS (none of whom was at the wedding) as the QUARTET plays. These FRIENDS are all dressed formally but with the look of people who dress this way every night. There-'s always one of these going on and they're always there. \nFLAN Yes, there is another chapter. \nOUISA Our kids came down from Harvard. a Loud groans of protest and disbelief fill the \nKITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM DAY Two of FLAN and OUISA'S college aged CHILDREN, WOODY and TESS, and KITTY and LARKIN'S boy, BEN, slump around the room. They are in dismay at OUISA, FLAN, KITTY and LARKIN and their story. \nFLAN --the details he knew--how would he know about the painting? FLAN has taken the Kandinsky off the wall and flipped it around to the wild side. \nFLAN Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky. FLAN leans the painting against a chair and studies it. \nOUISA And none of you knows this fellow? He has this wild quality--yet, a real elegance and a real concern and a real consideration. TESS looks at the floral arrangement PAUL sent. It's only slightly wilted. \nTESS Well, Mom, you should have let him stay. You should have divorced all your children and just let this dreamboat stay. Plus he sent you flowers. \nFLAN And jam . \nTHE KIDS Oooooo. \nOUISA I wish I knew how to get hold of his father. Just to see if there is any truth in it. \nLARKIN Who knows Sidney Poitier so we could just call him up and ask him? \nKITTY I have a friend who does theatrical law. I bet he - \nLARKIN What friend? KITTY (suddenly trapped) Oh, it's nobody. \nLARKIN I want to know. \nKITTY (SCREAMS) Nobody! \nLARKIN (RECONSIDERS) Whatever's going on anywhere, I do not want to know. I don't want to know. I don't want to know. \nKITTY (OVERLAPPING) Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. \nBEN (OVERLAPPING) Dad. Mom. Please. For once. Please? BEN, KITTY, LARKIN scream at each other in anguish. TESS, in a fury, leaves the apartment. FLAN follows HER to \nTHE OUTSIDE CORRIDOR. \nFLAN Tess, when you see your little sister, don't tell her that Paul and the hustler used her bed. \nTESS You put him in that bed. I'm not going to get involved with any conspiracy. \nFLAN It's not a conspiracy. It's a family. THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens. TESS and FLAN virtually growl at each other as the door shuts on TESS. \nFLAN sees KITTY, LARKIN and BEN screaming at each other. FLAN sees OUISA, to avoid involvement in the domestic stir, hang the Kandinsky back on the wall. The geometric ordered side. \nDR. FINE Breaking and entering. \nPAUL Breaking and entering? \nDR. FINE You're an imposter. \nPAUL Officer, your honor, your eminence, Dr. Fine cave me the keys to his brownstone. Isn't that so? \nDR. FINE My son doesn't know you. \nPAUL This man gave me the keys to the house. Isn't that so? THE COP puts his gun away. \nPOLICEMAN (SCREAMS) Did you give him the key to the house? \nDR. FINE Yes, but under false pretenses. This fucking black kid crack addict comes into my office \nLYING - \nPAUL (cool and forgiving) I have taken this much brandy but can pour the rest back into the bottle. And I've used electricity listening to the music, but I think you'll find that nothing's taken from the house. PAUL takes off the silk robe and neatly places it on the table. \nDR. FINE I want you to arrest this fraud. PAUL puts on his jacket and leaves the house. \nDR. FINE Stop him! THE POLICEMAN walks away. \nCOLLEGE DORM ROOM DOUG continues his tirade. \nDOUG A cretin! A creep! No wonder mother left you! \nDOUG flings the phone against the wall. \nDR. FINE'S OFFICE FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN look at DR. FINE sympathetically. \nDR. FINE Two sides. Every story. But THE TWO COUPLES are also embarrassed. \nBACK TO THE MORGAN LIBRARY PEOPLE from the back row of the concert turn away from the music and listen to OUISA and FLAN. \nOUISA We went down to the Strand - \nFLAN Five Sherlock Holmeses- \n0 EXT THE STRAND BOOKSTORE 12th STREET AND BROADWAY DAY The TWO COUPLES AND DR. FINE, go into \nTHE STRAND BOOKSTORE. which advertises itself as possessing Eight miles of books and that seems an understatement. THE CAMERA rushes past rows of books. And then suddenly stops. \nOUISA I found it! OUISA'S HAND reaches up and brings down. \nCU A COPY OF SIDNEY POITIER'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY: \"This Life\" OUISA reads from the Poitier autobiography. THE OTHERS are enrapt.. \nOUISA \"Back in New York with Juanita and the children, I began to become aware that our marriage, while working on some levels, was falling apart in other fundamental areas.\" FLAN takes the book. \nFLAN There's a picture of him and his four- daughters. No sons. Four daughters. \nBACK TO THE MORGAN LIBRARY \nFLAN The book's called This Life. \nA CONCERT-GOER No sons? \nOUISA No sons! \nTHE STRAND BOOKSTORE \nKITTY Oh dear. \nOUISA This kid bulldozing his way into our lives. \nLA.RKIN is We let him in our lives. I run a foundation. You're a dealer. You're a doctor. You'd think we'd be satisfied with our achievements. \nTNT THE GOTHAM RESTAURANT DAY THE FIVE of THEM have gone down the street fram the Strand to this swell restaurant. \nFLAN Agatha Christie would ask what do we all have in common? \nOUISA It seems the common thread linking us all is an overwhelming need to be in the movie of Cats. \nKITTY Our kids. Struggling through their lives. \nLARKIN I don't want to know anything about the spillover of their lives. \nOUISA \nAll we have in common is our children went to boarding school together. FLAN (to Dr. Fine) How come we never met? \nTESS You went to Cats. You said it was an all time low in a lifetime of theater going. OUISA considers. \nOUISA Film is a different medium. \nTESS You said Aeschylus did not invent theater to have it end up a bunch of chorus kids wondering which of them will go to Kitty Kat Heaven. \nOUISA I don't remember saying that. \nFLAN No, I think that was Starlight Express - \nTESS Well, maybe he'll make a movie of Starlight Express and you can all be on roller skates! THE KIDS stand up. \nDOUG This is so humiliating. \nBEN This is so pathetic. \nTESS This is so racist. \nOUISA This is not racist! THE KIDS stride out of the DINING HALL into \nTHE CORRIDOR. THEIR PARENTS run ahead trying to circle them. \nDOUG How can I get in touch with anybody in high school? I've outgrown them. \nKITTY Now can you outgrow them? You graduated a year ago! THE PARENTS stop in front of \nTHE MAIN ENTRANCE blocking TESS and DOUG and BEN's escape. OUISA takes a red book out of her bag and brandishes at THEM. \nOUISA Here is a copy of your yearbook. I want you to get the phone numbers of everybody in your class. You all went to the same boarding school. \nDR. FINE You can charge it to my phone. \nOUISA Call everyone in your class and ask them if they know-- THE THREE KIDS try to break through the blockade. \nDOUG Never! \nTESS This is the KGB. \nDR. FINE You're on the phone all the time. Now I ask you to make calls all over the country and you become reticent. \nTESS This is the entire McCarthy period. WOODY saunters up to his PARENTS. HE is very cool. FLAN and OUISA smile at his sweet attitude. \nWOODY I just want to get one thing straight. \nFLAN Finally, we hear from the peanut gallery. And WOODY screams at THEM in rage, his voice echoing, mindless of the STUDENTS who freeze in the background as you would at a traffic accident. \nWOODY You gave him my pink shirt? You gave a complete stranger my pink shirt? That pink shirt was a Christmas present from you. I treasured that shirt. I loved that shirt. My collar size has grown a full size from weight lifting. And you saw my arms had grown, you saw my neck had grown. And you bought me that shirt for my new body. I loved that shirt. The first shirt for my new body. And you gave that shirt away. I can't believe it. I hate this life. I hate you. \nEXT ELIOT HOUSE WOODY's wrath grows and grows and drives OUISA and FLAN, indeed all the PARENTS, out of the serene, venerable Harvard building onto the street. PASSERSBY stop and gape. WOODY doesn't care. \nDOUG You never do anything for me. \nTESS You've never done anything but tried to block me. \nBEN I'm only this pathetic extension of your eighth rate personality. \nDOUG Social Darwinism pushed beyond all limits. \nWOODY You gave away my pink shirt? \nTESS You want me to be everything you weren't. \nDOUG You said drugs and looked at me. THE PARENTS go down the street, speechless, defeated. \nCUT TO PAGES of a Yearbook turning. The pages stop. \nTESS (VO) Trent Conway. - \nEXT THE BANKS OF THE CHARLES RIVER DAY THE FOUR KIDS look through their high school yearbook. TESS spots a face. THEY all consider. \nTHE KIDS Trent Conway. \nCU \nTRENT CONWAY'S YEARBOOK PICTURE TRENT is weasel faced. Very hard to read. Not quite looking into the yearbook photographer's camera. \nTESS Trent Conway. \nDOUG Look at those beady eyes staring out at me. \nBEN Trent Conway. \nTRENT I feel like Scheherazade! TRENT embraces PAUL with fierce tenderness. Maybe TRENT had one happy day and this is it. \nTRENT I don't want you to leave me, Paul. I'll go through my address book and tell you about family after family. You 111 never not fit in again. we'll give you a new ideas it.y. I'll make you the most eagerly sought after young man in the East. And then I'I1 come into one of these homes one day---and you'll be there and I'll be presented to you. And I'll pretend to meet you for the first time and our friendship will be witnessed by my friends, our parents' friends. If it all happens under their noses, they can't judge me. They can't disparage you. I'll make you a guest in their houses. Ask me another name. I'd like to try for the shirt. PAUL kisses TRENT. \nPAUL That's enough for today. PAUL takes his shoes and the address book and goes. \nKITTRED4 E' S LIVING ROOM 40 OUISA brushes TESS's hair as THEY listen. \nTRENT'S TAPED VOICE Paul stayed with me for three months. \nTRENT CONWAY'S APARTMENT PAUL leans against the white wall. PAUL frowns, then smiles. All ready PAUL has begun to change from a street kid to someone quite preppy - very Ralph Lauren. Only on the surface. HE's still learning. \nTRENT This is the way you must speak. Hear my accent. Hear my voice. Never say you're going horse back riding. You say You're going Riding. And don't say couch. Say sofa. And you say Bodd-ill. It's bottle. Say bottle of beer. \nPAUL Bodd-ill a bee-ya. \nTRENT Bottle of beer. \nPAUL \n(SERIOUS) Bodd-ill a bee-ya. \n(FLIRTATIOUS) Bodd-ill a bee-ya. \n(SUSPICIOUS) Bodd-ill a bee-ya. \n(ELATED) Bottle of beer. TRENT claps. PAUL bows to TRENT. TRENT'S face is transfigured with joy. \nCOMPUTER ROOM TRENT smiles at TESS but the smile is one of tight lipped stoicism. \nTRENT We went through the address book letter by letter. Paul vanished by the L's. He took the address book with him. Well, he's already been in all your houses. Maybe I will meet him again. I sure would like to. TRENT stands up signalling an end to the conversation. HE turns off his computers. \nTESS His past? His real name? \nTRENT I don't know anything about him. It was a rainy night in Boston. He was in a doorway. That's all. \nTESS He took stuff from you? \nTRENT Besides the address book? He took my stereo and sport jacket and my word processor and my laser printer. And my skis. And my TV. \nTESS Will you press charges? \nTRENT No. \nTESS It's a felony. \nTRENT Why do they want to find him? \nTES S They say to help him. If there's a crime, the cops will get involved. \nTRENT Look, we must keep in touch. We were friends for a brief bit in school. I mean we were really good friends. \nKITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nTESS'S TAPED VOICE won't you press charges? \nTRENT'S TAPED VOICE Please. TESS leans forward-and snaps off the tape recorder. OUISA is amazed. \nINT LINCOLN CENTER METROPOLITAN OPERA NIGHT FLAN and OUISA have brought their FRIENDS up to date. \nOUISA Paul learned all that in three months! \nOPERAGOER Three months? \nFLAN Three months! The chimes ring, signalling the start of the opera. \nOUISA who would have thought it? Trent Conway, the Henry Higgins of our time. THE GROUP laughs and finishes their drinks as THE USHER unlocks the door to \nTHE OPERA BOX. THE GROUP proceeds in, deciding who'll sit where in the box and checking their programs. OUISA looks into the vastness of the Metropolitan Opera House. THe chandeliers are rising into the ceiling. \nOPERAGOER #1 Quick - what the hell is the story of this opera? FLAN adjusts his opera glasses. a \nOPERAGOER #2 Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. OUISA is distracted. \nOUISA Paul must have looked at all those names and said I am Columbus. I am Magellan. I will sail into this new world. The camera comes in on OUISA as she remembers \nTHE KITTREDGE LIVING ROOM. TESS laughs. OUISA laughs. It's a nice moment between these two. \nOUISA I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people. Six degrees of separation. Between us and everybody else on this planet. The President of the United States. A. gondolier in Venice. Fill in the names. I find that A.] tremendously comforting that we're so close and B.] like Chinese water torture that we're so close. Because you have to find the right six people to make the connection. It's not just big names. It's anyone. A native in a rain forest. A Tierra del Fuegan. An Eskimo. I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people. It's a profound thought. How Paul found us. How to find the man whose son he pretends to be. Or perhaps j& his son, although I doubt it. How every person is a new door, opening up into other worlds. Six degrees of separation between me and everyone else on this planet. But to find the right six people. TESS kisses HER MOTHER. OUISA puts out the light and THEY leave the room. \nMUSIC THE ACT ONE MUSIC OF PUCCINI'S TOSCA suddenly swells up and \nDOORMAN Your son! I know all about your son. \nFLAN What about my son? \nDOORMAN Not the little shit who lives here. The other son. The secret son. The negro son you deny. \nFLAN The negro son? \nDOORMAN The black son you make live in Central Park while you're gallivanting around Rome. The DOORMAN spits at FLAN again. \nSOHO LOFT THE JAPANESE HOSTESS is interested. \nTHE JAPANESE HOSTESS You have a black son? \nFLAN No! The cops brought this young girl to us! \nOUISA The cops called us up and we went down to the precinct again! \nINT PRECINCT DAY THE DETECTIVE sits on the edge of his desk. OUISA and FLAN sit in chairs in the small office, looking on uncomfortably. The emotion in the shabby room is too big for the size of it. THEY watch a young woman named ELIZABETH,in her mid-20s, seated behind the DETECTIVE'S desk. \nELIZABETH (in a rage) I want him dead. That's all I want. \nSOHO LOFT OUISA leans forward at the dinner table. \nOUISA The next chapter. THE PARTY is silenced. \nTHE PRECINCT \nELIZABETH My boy friend and I took a picnic into the park \nEXT CENTRAL PARK DAY RICK, ELIZABETH and PAUL sprawl out on the grass in the sun, under the statue of the Alaskan husky, the remains of a picnic around them. Bongo Drums play in the distance. \nELIZABETH (VO) and we met this guy and started singing and talking. RICK, a nice young guy in his mid-twenties, plays his guitar energetically, the THREE of them having a great time singing a cheery old rock song. PAUL is wearing the pink shirt and the khakis but looks pretty seedy. HE eats hungrily. \nPAUL I was hallucinating from not eating- \nELIZABETH If I told people back home that New York had trees and picnics, they'd swear I was lying. I love New York so much. Look at it! I can't get over it. \nRICK We're here from Utah. \nPAUL Do they have any black people in Utah? \nRICK Maybe two. \nELIZABETH I saw them once. Two black people. \nRICK Yes, the Mormons brought in two. THEY all laugh, enjoying each other, the day, the meeting. \nELIZABETH We came here to be actors. \nRICK She won the all-state competition for comedy and drama. \nPAUL My gosh! ELIZABETH stands up and declaims. \nELIZABETH \"The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth like the gentle rain from heaven..\" SHE's not bad. But then SHE giggles and the Shakespearean effect crumbles. \nRICK And we study and we wait tables. \nELIZABETH Because you have to have technique. ELIZABETH and RICK are very earnest. \nPAUL Like the painters. Cezanne looked for the rules behind the spontaneity of Impressionism. \nRICK Cez - That's a painter? \nELIZABETH We don't know anything about painting. \nPAUL My dad loves painting. He has a Kandinsky but he loves Cezanne the most. He lives up there. \nRICK What? \nPAUL points up at 910 FIFTH, the home of the Kittredge's. \nPAUL He lives up there. Count six windows over. John Flanders Kittredge. His chums-call him Flan. I was the child of Flan's hippie days. His radical days. He went down South as a freedom marcher, to register black voters - his friends were killed. Met my mother. Registered her and married her in a fit of sentimental righteousness and knocked her up with me and came back here and abandoned her. Went to Harvard. He's now a fancy art dealer. Lives up there. Count six windows over. Won't see me. The new wife--the white wife-- The Louisa Kittredge Call Me Ouisa wife - the mother of the new children wife-- \nRICK Your brothers and sisters? \nPAUL (BITTER) They go to Andover and Exeter and Harvard and Yale. The awful thing is my father started out good. My mother says there is a good man inside s J. Flanders Kittredge. \nELIZABETH He'll see you if he is that good. He can't forget you entirely. \nPAUL I call him. He hangs up. \nRICK I swear nothing like this ever happened in Utah. \nTHE RAINBOW ROOM At first PEOPLE don't notice RICK and PAUL dancing. Then PEOPLE do notice. \nRICK (VO) And, I'll tell you, nothing like that must have ever happened at the Rainbow Room because they asked us to leave. It was so funny. PAUL spins RICK round and round and the CAMERA spins with \nTHEM. \nRICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT \nRICK You'll love the place. It's up so high. \nTHE RAINBOW ROOM THE CAMERA spins around the panoramic view sixty-five floors and then spins out of the windows down onto \nEXT THE ICE RINK ROCKEFELLER CENTER NIGHT THE CAMERA focusses in on a COUPLE spinning in the middle of the ice. RICK and PAUL, hysterical with laughter, cut through Rockefeller Center and then come to Fifth Avenue where A HANSOM CARRIAGE waits. THE DRIVER tips his hat to these customers. PAUL jumps into \nTHE HANSOM CARRIAGE. \nRICK We don't have any money - \nPAUL Amigo! When will you learn! Money is one commodity you can always get. THE HANSOM CARRIAGE proceeds up to Central Park. RICK leans forward looking out the isinglass windows. \nRICK I'm going to have to explain to Elizabeth about the money and calm her. She gets so nervous \nABOUT- (PAUL draws a circle on RICK's back.) Hey, stop that. Paul. Come on. \nPAUL I was wondering if I could fuck you. RICK laughs. Then sees PAUL is serious. \nRICK I don't do things like that. \nPAUL That's what makes it so nice. You don't. \nRICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT RICK reaches over and turns off the light by the bedside. Downstairs we hear the throb beginning of the roller disco. ELIZABETH looks at him coldly. \nRICK - and he did and it was fantastic. \nTHE HANSOM CARRIAGE Time has passed. PAUL kisses an amazed, mussed RICK on the mouth and jumps out of the CARRIAGE and goes off into the dark. \nEXT CENTRAL PARK THE DRIVER stands up seeing PAUL run out. RICK runs out of the CARRIAGE after PAUL. THE DRIVER chases them. \nCU RICK lost in the nighttime park. RICK looks up and sees the STATUE OF THE HUSKY. \nRICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT RICK paces back and forth. \nRICK Didn't we come here for experience? Right? We can use this. Right? ELIZABETH lies on her stomach on the bed away from him. \nTHE PRECINCT ELIZABETH rolls a pencil back and forth on the desk. FLAN and OUISA watch sympathetically. \nELIZABETH He rambled on for hours. His own father warned me Rick was a fool and I looked at Rick and knew his father was right. \nRICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT RICK paces back and forth in a rage, pulling at his tux. \nRICK - - My father is not right! I can't have him be right. I wanted experience. We came here for experience. What's so wrong with that? Right? ELIZABETH is repelled by him. \nELIZABETH Don't touch me! \nTHE PRECINCT ELIZABETH rubs her hands over her face as if trying to get the memory away. OUISA looks at FLAN and THE DETECTIVE. \nELIZABETH He went on for a long time trying to get me just to look at him. I couldn't even do that. \nRICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT \nRICK But I didn't come here to do this or lose that or be this or do this to you. Not to you. Look at me? Elizabeth! What did I let him do to me? \nELIZABETH Nobody did this but you. \nBACK IN ORSO'S RESTAURANT \nFLAN Now the amazing part is \nOUISA talk about six degrees \nFLAN We were in the roller disco that night! ANDREW and JEANNIE's jaws drop. \nOUISA Yes! There we were roller skating for heart disease or cancer - \nFLAN It was illiteracy. \nINT ROLLER DISCO NIGHT MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE all dolled up roll skate around and around trying to keep their balance to 40s swing music. Among the SKATERS we spot FLAN and OUISA at this ROLLER DISCO BENEFIT skating round and round breathlessly going faster and faster, laughing and laughing. Lights flash and whirl. \nORSO'S RESTAURANT \nKITTY Come for dinner with us after \nOUISA We'd love to but can't! \nFLAW So sorry!

THEY cut down a side aisle. \nFLAN It's a second level Matisse - \nOUISA but a Matisse - \nKITTY Who are you buying it for? The Japanese? Germans? AN ORGAN suddenly begins playing a triumphant Bach cantata. \nOUISA Not allowed to tell. OUISA turns to look up at the choir loft. \nLARKIN Then it's the Germans. \nFLAN They'll go as high as - \nOUISA Don't tell all the family secrets - \nFLAN Well over 25 million. \nLARKIN Out of which you will keep - \nOUISA Not that much in this new market. \nFLAN Ugh. Bring back the 80s. I'll have to give most of it away, but the good part is it gives me a credibility in this new market. It's all out of whack. Everything's up. Everything's down. I mean, a David Fucking Hockney print sold for a hundred bucks fifteen years ago went for Thirty four thousand dollars! A print! A flower. You know Geoffrey. our South African - OUISA shushes FLAN. THEY have arrived at \nINT THE BAPTISTRY OF THE CATHEDRAL OF ST.

A store was selling cruelty-free cosmetics. \nINT HARVARD DORM ROOM TESS is curled up on her bed enjoying this chat. \nTESS Mother, that is such a beautiful thing. Do you realize the agony cosmetic companies put rabbits through to test eye shadow? \nA \nMASTER BEDROOM \nOUISA Dearest, I know that. I'm only talking about the phrase. Cruelty-free cosmetics should take away all evidence of time and cellulite and-- \nHARVARD DORM ROOM \nTESS Mother, I'm getting married. \nMASTER BEDROOM OUISA picks up the receiver on the cordless phone. This is too important for 'a speaker phone. \nOUISA I thought you were going to Afghanistan. \nTESS (VO) I am going to get married and then go to Afghanistan. \nOUISA One country at a time. You are not getting married. \nHARVARD DORM ROOM \nTESS Immediately so deeply negative-- \nOUISA (VO) I know everyone you know and you are not marrying any of them. \nTESS The arrogance that you would assume you know everyone I know. The way you say it: I know everyone you know - \nMASTER BEDROOM In the Background, FLAN shaves at the bathroom mirror. \nOUISA Unless you met them in the last two days - you can't hold a secret. (The other line rings) Wait- I'm putting you on hold \nDUISA Ahh, you've become an aesthete. \nPAUL Are you laughing at me? \nOUISA No. I read them too. \nPAUL I read The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone about Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel. \nDUISA You're ahead of me there. \nPAUL Have you seen the Sistine Chapel? \nOUISA Oh yes. Even gone to the top of it in a rickety elevator to watch the men clean it. \nPAUL You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel? PAUL leans into the phone, amazed, as the screen floods with the brightly colored ceiling of the \nINT SISTINE CHAPEL OUISA and FLAN stand on the top of a rickety platform. THE WORIOCkN slaps it. \nOUISA (VO) Absolutely. Stood right under the hand of God touching the hand of man. \nTHE WORKMAN Hit it. Hit it. It's only a fresco. OUISA looks up at the hand of God. SHE laughs and slaps the hand of God. PAUL smiles in wonderment as the SCREEN fills with color. But then WE're out of his imagination and see the squalid surroundings of his phone booth. \nPAUL You slapped God's hand! \nKITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nOUISA I slapped God's clean hand. And you know what they clean it with? All this technology? Q-tips and water. PAUL is thrilled by this bit of knowledge. \nPAUL No! \nOUISA Clean away the years of grime and soot and paint ovens. Q-tips and water changing the history of Western art. Vivid colors. \nPAUL Take me to see it? \nOUISA Take you to see it? Paul, they think you might have murdered someone! You stole money! 0 FLAN appears, needing help with his studs. \nFLAN Honey, could you give me a hand with-- OUISA (mouths to Flan) It's Paul.

TESS hangs up. ANOTHER PHONE is picked up. It is at \nTHE PRECINCT. THE DETECTIVE doesn't even get to say \"Hello\". FLAN (on the phone) I've got that kid on the line. \nDETECTIVE Find out where he is. \nKITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM FLAN (mouths to Ouisa) Find out where he is \nPAUL Who's there? \nOUISA Look, why don't you cone here. Where are you? PAUL, pressed in the battered phone booth, doesn't want to be in this cold street with its brightly lit squalor. HE wants to be at OUISA's, but his fear wins out. \nPAUL I come there and you'll have the cops waiting. \nOUISA You have to trust us. \nPAUL Why? \nOUISA Because - we like you. \nFLAN (mouths) Where is he? PAUL, straining to hear, gets very paranoid. \nPAUL Who's there? \nIT'S - I'm not here. It's Flan. FLAN groans impatiently. PAUL brightens. THE OPERATOR makes noises. PAUL drops a coin in the box. \nPAUL Are you in tonight? I could come and make a feast for you. \nOUISA Have some flexibility! You're stupid not to recognize what you could be. \nPAUL What could I be? \nOUISA So much. \nPAUL With you behind me? \nOUISA Perhaps. You liked that night? I've thought since that you spent all your time laughing at us. \nPAUL No. \nSHE walks down the HALL. \nDUISA That you had brought that awful hustling thing back to show us your contempt - \nPAUL I was so happy. I wanted to add sex to it. Don't you do that? OUISA looks into the MASTER BEDROOM and goes in. \nDUISA (PAUSE) No. \nPAUL I'll tell you my name. \nOUISA Please? \nPAUL It's Paul Poitier-Kittredge. It's a hyphenated name. SHE sits on her bed. \nOUISA Paul? You need help. Go to the police. Turn yourself in. You'll be over it all the sooner. You can start. \nPAUL Start what? \nOUISA Your life. \nPAUL Will you help me? OUISA stands up. \nOUISA I will help you. But you have to go to the police and go to jail and - \nPAUL Will you send me books and polaroids of you and cassettes? And letters? \nOUISA Yes. OUISA walks rapidly down the HALL. \nPAUL Will you visit me? \nOUISA I will visit you. \nPAUL And when you do, you'll wear your best clothes and knock em dead? SHE's in the LIVING ROOM. \nOUISA I'll knock em dead. But you've got to be careful in prison. You have to use condoms. \nPAUL I won't have sex in prison. I only have sex when I'm happy. \nOUISA Go to the police. \nPAUL Will you take me? \nOUISA I'll give you the name of-the detective to see- \nPAUL I'll be treated with care if you take me to the police. If they don't know you're special, they kill you. \nOUISA I don't think they kill you. PAUL puts the phone receiver over his head in a sudden gesture of fear. Then HE returns the receiver to his ear. \nPAUL Mrs. Louisa Kittredge, I am black. \nPAUSE. \nOUISA I will deliver you to them with kindness and affection. \nPAUL And I'll plead guilty and go to prison and serve a few months. \nOUISA A few months tops. \nPAUL Then I'll come out and work for you and learn - \nOUISA We'll work that out. \nPAUL I want to know now. \nOUISA Yes. You'll work for us. \nPAUL Learn all the trade. Not just the grotty part. \nOUISA Top to bottom. \nOUISA We can skip the shmoozing. Pick the boy up, take him to the police and be at Sotheby's before eight. \nINT A FORMAL DINING ROOM Of all the PARTIES we've been to, this is the most luxurious of all, given by one of New York's legendary hostess's, a glamorous woman who must be in her late 80s, MRS. BANNISTER. OUISA and FLAN are here. This dinner is really a state occasion in honor of that United Nations type at MRS. BANNISTER'S right. But FLAN and OUISA have captured the table. \nOUISA t The story ended there... \nFLAN It did not! Clearly OUISA is as disturbed by the telling of the events as FLAN is energized. \nOUISA There are so many other people here tonight. We didn't mean to take up so much MRS. BANNISTER slams her napkin down. \nMRS. BANNISTER No! It's my supper and I command you to sing! \nFLAN We called our new best friend, the detective. \nOUISA We told them Paul was at the Waverly theater. FLAN (to his dinner partner) Sixth Avenue and Third Street. The lobby. \nOUISA But we had promised Paul that we would bring him to the police. We told the police he was special. \nFLAN Well, Ouisa did. \nOUISA The detective said he'd honor our promise. \nFLAN We skipped the cocktails \nOUISA But we didn't count on \nEXT TRAFFIC ON FIFTH AVENUE OUISA and FLAN in dinner clothes are stuck in a traffic jam. \nOUISA (VO) Traffic traffic traffic FLAN gets out of the car and looks ahead in this din of honking horns. \nEXT WAVERLY MOVIE THEATER, GREENWICH VILLAGE NIGHT FLAN and OUISA speed up Sixth Avenue and double park in front of the Waverly Movie Theater. Two Cop cars are there. Red lights spinning. PEOPLE gape on the street. \nTHEY see PAUL being dragged into one of the two Cop cars, t kicking and screaming. THE COPS throw PAUL into the back seat. FLAN tries to talk to one of the POLICE while OUISA runs up to the Cop car window. PAUL, being handcuffed, looks at OUISA. HE smiles as if HE's bumped into DUISA at a cocktail party. \nPAUL The Kandinsky is painted on both sides. DUISA is startled. THE COP slams the car door on PAUL. \nOUISA Paul? Officer? Let me go with you - I promised I'd take him! \nOFFICER Lady. Out of the way -- FLAN takes OUISA's-arm. \nOUISA We have to do soaething! \nFLAN \nLet's just get the hell out of here. THE COP CAR pulls away, sirens blaring. PAUL turns and looks at OUISA. Betrayal. \nBACK IN THE FORMAL DINING ROOM \nMRS. BANNISTER There's nothing more you can do - \nFLAN What could we do? We tried. \nOUISA went to the precinct. \nINT THE PRECINCT DAY DUISA hands the detective's card to the DESK CLERK. \nCLERK He's transferred. \nOUISA Since yesterday? He's been handling this \nCLERK He's transferred - \nOUISA This is about an arrest made yesterday at the Waverly Movie theater - THE CLERK checks the records. \nCLERK This precinct didn't do any business at the Waverly Theater. \nOUISA I didn't imagine it - \nCLERK I'm not saying you did. \nOUISA Could you find out which precinct - THE CLERK looks through the book. \nCLERK The name? \nOUISA Poitier. He's a young black man. Or maybe Kittredge. I don't know the exact name - \nCLERK Are you family? \nOUISA Not exactly. But the detective promised me yesterday that I could go with the young man when he was arraigned to let them know he was special. \nCLERK We have no record of it. Some other precinct must have made the arrest. It sounds like your special friend was wanted for something else. \n", "test1_input": "OUISA You darling old poop - \nFLAN Have you seen the new book on Cezanne? \nGEOFFREY \nNO \nOUISA An absolute revelation - this'll only take a mo- OUISA rushes out of the bathroom after GEOFFREY. \nFLAN I need the gauze \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR \nOUISA I ran down the hall to get the book on Cezanne, got the gauze from my bathroom-- \nBACK AT THE KITTREDGE'S We watch a flustered OUSIA dart about as she describes-- \nOUISA (VO) Gave the Cezanne to Flan who wanted the gauze, gave the gauze to Geoffrey who wanted Cezanne. OUISA mutters under her breath as she dashes down \nTHE HALL. \nOUISA two million dollars two million dollars \nAND INTO \nTHE LIVING ROOM \nGEOFFREY stares at the gauze he's just been handed. \nFLAK'S VOICE ouisa? OUISA grabs the gauze out of GEOFFREY's hand. SHE runs back down the HALL. \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR \nOUISA Two million dollars two million dollars-- \nBACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S BATHROOM FLAN finishes bandaging PAUL's wound. OUISA goes into \nHER SON'S BEDROOM., SHE takes a pink shirt from the bureau. \nTHE MASTER BEDROOM PAUL puts on the pink shirt and looks at HIMSELF in the mirror. \nFLAN He's going to be fine. GEOFFREY appears in the door with the book on Cezanne. \nGEOFFREY Lovely book. FLAN looks stricken. \nOUISA Please? Stay? GEOFFREY pauses. \nGEOFFREY Agreed. FLAN beams. \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR \nOUISA And peace was restored. \nBACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM FLAN holds out PAUL's blazer. PAUL winces as HE lifts his arms to put it on. \nPAUL Your children said you were kind. All the kids were sitting around the dorm one night dishing the- shit out of their parents. But your kids were silent and said No, not our parents. Not Flan and Ouisa. Not the Kittredges. The Kittredges are kind. So after the muggers left, I looked up and saw these Fifth Avenue apartments. Mrs. Onassis lives there. I know the Babcocks live over there. The Auchinclosses live there. But you lived here. I came here. OUISA, so touched, turns to FLAN and GEOFFREY. \nOUISA Can you believe what the kids said? PAUL looks at the framed photos on wall of \n0 THE HALL. \nPAUL But your kids - I love them. Talbot and Woody mean the world to me. \nFLAN He lets you call him Woody? Nobody's called him Woody in years. THEY come into \nTHE LIVING ROOM. PAUL looks around happily. HE goes to the wall by the mantlepiece and looks at a dark abstract painting. \nPAUL They described this apartment in detail. This is a Kandinsky! - a double. One painted on either side. May I see - ? OUISA lifts the painting off the wall and turns it around. Even GEOFFREY is taken by the painting. \nFLAN What makes it valuable is Kandinsky painted on either side of the canvas in two wildly different styles. One side is geometric and somr=r. The other side is wild and vivid. \nGEOFFREY My god! \nFLAN We flip it around for variety. OUISA happily turns the painting back and forth to show off its two sides. The SCREEN is filled with the bright colors then the dark colors. \nOUISA You like? You like? Chaos? Control? Chaos? Control? SHE puts on a goofy happy face for the chaotic side and a dopey tragic face for the geometric. Yes. We've been here before, through OUISA's memory, at the wedding. \nPAUL It's wonderful. OUISA leans the painting against a chair, the chaotic side showing. \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR FLAN turns to JULIA. \n", "test1_true": "BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM PAUL looks around the apartment, so cozy, warm. \nPAUL It's the way they said it would be. \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR \nOUISA Geoffrey had been silent up to now. \nBACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nGEOFFREY Did you bitch your parents? \nPAUL As a matter of fact. No. Your kids and I...we both liked our parents... loved our--Look, am I getting in the way? I burst in here, hysterical. Blood.

Another girl at Groton. \nBACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nOUISA How Harvard? \nPAUL Well, fine. It's just there. Everyone's in a constant state of luxurious despair and constant discovery and paralysis. \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR \nOUISA We asked him where home was \nFLAN Out West, he said. \nBACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nPAUL Although I've lived all over. My folks are divorced. He's remarried. He's doing a movie. \nOUISA He's in the movies? \nPAUL He's directing this one but he does act. \nFLAN What's he directing? \nPAUL Cats. \nOUISA Someone is directing a film of Cats? \nFLAN Don't be snooty. \nPAUL You've'seen it? T.S. Eliot-- \nFLAN Well, yes. Years ago. \nOUISA A benefit for some disease or school--- \nFLAN Surely they can't make the movie of Cats. \nOUISA Of course they can. \nPAUL They're going to try. My father'll be here \nAUDITIONING- \nOUISA Cats? \nPAUL He's going to use people. \nOUISA What a courageous stand! \nPAUL They thought of lots of ways to go. Animation. \nFLAN Animation would be nice. \nPAUL But he found a better way. As a matter of fact, he turned it down at first. He went to tell the producers - as a courtesy - all the reasons why you couldn't make a movie of Cats and in going through all the reasons why you couldn't make a movie of Cats, he suddenly saw how you could make a movie of Cats -- \nOUISA Eureka in the bathtub. How wonderful. \nFLAN May we ask who -- \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR Can it be possible? A FEW MORE GUESTS have joined the table. \nOUISA And it was here we pulled up - ever so slightly - pulled up closer-- \n", "test1_id": 1878, "test2_input": "FLAN And he told us. \nOUISA He named the greatest black star in movies. \nSIDNEY - \nFLAN Don't say it. We're trying to keep this abstract. Plus libel laws. \nOUISA Sidney Poitiers There. I don't care. We have to have truth. He started out as a lawyer and is terrified of libel. I'm not. \nINT THE WHITE WALL PAUL, leaning against the wall, talks with great vivacity to that OFF SCREEN PRESENCE who is the POV of the camera. \nPAUL Sidney Poitier, the future Jackie Robinson of films, was born the twenty fourth of February 1927 in Miami during a visit his parents made to Florida - legally? -to sell tomatoes they had grown on their farm in the Bahamas. He grew up on Cat Island, \"so poor they didn't even own dirt\" he has said. Neglected by his family, my father would sit on the shore, and, as he told me many times, \"conjure up the kind of worlds that were on the other side and what I'd do in them.\" He arrived in New York City from the Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus station across from the old Madison Square Garden at Fiftieth and Eighth Avenue. He moved to the roof of the Brill building, commonly known as Tin Pan Alley. Washed dishes at the Turf restaurant for $4.11 a night. He taught 0 himself to read by reading the newspaper. In the Black newspaper, the theater page was opposite the Want Ad page. Among his 42 films are No Way Out 1950/ Cry the Beloved Country 1952/ Blackboard Jungle 1955/ The Defiant Ones 1958/ Raisin in the Sun 1961/ Lilies of the Field 1963/ In the Heat of the Night 1967/ To Sir With Love 1967/ Shoot to Kill 1988 and, of course, \nPAUSE. (THE OFF SCREEN VOICE JOINS HIM) Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. \nPAUL (LAUGHS) He won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field and was twice named top male box-office star in the country. My father made no films from 1977 to 1987 but worked as director and author. Dad said to me once \"I still don't fully understand how all that came about in the sequence it came about\". And we hear the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE applauding. PAUL bows, happily. HE kicks his shoe off into the camera. \nBACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nPAUL Dad's not in till tomorrow at the Sherry. I came down from Cambridge. Thought I'd stay at some fleabag for adventure. Orwell. Down and Out. I really don't know New York. I know Rome and Paris and Los Angeles a lot better. \nOUISA We're-going out to dinner. You'll come. \nPAUL Out to dinner? \nFLAN Out to dinner. \nPAUL But why go out to dinner? \nOUISA Because we have reservations and oh my god'what time is it? Have we lost the reservations and we don't have a damn thing in the house and it's Sixteenth century Florence and there's genius on every block. \nGEOFFREY Don't mock. SHE kisses GEOFFREY. \nPAUL You must have something in the fridge. \nFLAN A frozen steak from the Ice Age. \nPAUL Why spend a hundred dollars on a bowl of rice? Let me into the kitchen. Cooking calms me. What I'd like to do is calm down, pay back your kids- \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR \nOUISA He mentioned our kids names-- \nFLAN turns to a NEWCOMER. \nFLAN Two. Two at Harvard. A daughter at Groton. \nBACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nPAUL - who've been wonderful to me. \nOUISA They've never mentioned you. \nFLAN What are they supposed to say? We've become friends with the son of Sidney Poitier, barrier breaker of the fifties and sixties? \nGEOFFREY Your father means a great deal in South Africa. \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR \nOUISA Even Geoffrey was touched. \nBACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM \nPAUL I'm glad of that. Dad and I went to Russia once to a film festival and he was truly amazed how much his presence meant - \nOUISA Oh no! Tell us stories of movie stars tying up their children and being cruel. \nPAUL I wish. \nGEOFFREY You wish? \nPAUL If I wanted to write a book about him. I really can't. No one would want to read it. He's decent. I admire him. \nOUISA He's married to an actress who was in one of-- she's white? Am I right? \nPAUL (painful territory) That is not my mother. That is his second wife. He met Joanna making \"The Lost Man\". He left my mother who had stuck by him in the lean years. X had just been born. \"The Lost Man\" is the only film of my father's I can't bring myself to see. \nOUISA Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to - \nPAUL (BRIGHT) No! We're all good friends now. . His kids from that marriage. Us - the old kids. I'd love to get in that kitchen. FLAN (to Ouisa) What should we do? \n", "test2_true": "GEOFFREY I vote - stay in. OUISA, FLAN and PAUL Good! \nMILLBROOK CLUB BAR \nOUISA We moved.into the kitchen. \nBACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S KITCHEN THE KITCHEN is large, was built in the 205 when people had big dinners at home. PAUL opens the refrigerators and freezers. PAUL'S actions are synchronous with the words. \nFLAN (VO) We watched him cook. \nOUISA (VO) We watched him cook and chop. \nFLAN (VO) He sort of did wizardry \nOUISA (VO) An old jar of sun dried tomatoes-- \nFLAN (VO) Left avers - tuna fish - olives - onions - It's all dazzling and rapid. FLAN opens the wine. OUISA takes dishes and silver out and hands them to GEOFFREY. EVERYONE is in a picnic spirit. PAUL fills a large pot with water from the tap. PAUL (to Geoffrey) \nYOU'RE FROM \nGEOFFREY Johannesburg. PAUSE. PAUL Studies GEOFFREY. OUISA and FLAN freeze. Is it a tense moment? PAUL takes a breath. PAUL puts the water on the fire, eyes never off GEOFFREY. Then PAUL resumes chopping onions briskly and dropping them into the frying pan. \nPAUL My dad took me to a movie shot in South Africa. The camera moved from this vile rioting in the \nstreets to a villa where people picked at lunch on a terrace, the only riot the flowers and the birds-- gorgeous plumage and petals. And I didn't understand. And Dad said to me \"You meet these young blacks who are having a terrible time. They've had a totally inadequate education and yet in '76 - the year of the Soweto riots - they took on a tremendous political responsibility. It just makes you wonder at the maturity that is in them.\" PAUL opens a cabinet and takes out a Haitian candelabra that obviously hasn't been used since it was brought home as a souvenir. PAUL dusts it off. \nPAUL it makes you realize that the 'crummy childhood' theory, that everything can be blamed in a Freudian fashion on the fact that you've had a bad upbringing, just doesn't hold water. May I? \nFLAN Oh, please. PAUL pours a brandy. \nGEOFFREY What about being black in America? PAUL scoops a melange of vegetables into a glass dish and puts it in the microwave. \nPAUL My problem is I've never felt American. I grew up in Switzerland. Boarding school. Villa Rosey. \nOUISA There is a boarding school in Switzerland that takes you at age eighteen months. \nPAUL That's not me. I've never felt people liked me for my connections. Movie star kid problems. None of those. THE WATER boils. HE dumps in pasta. The microwave timer goes off. PAUL removes the glass dish. \nPAUL But I never knew I was black in that racist way 0 till I was sixteen and came back here. Very protected. White servants. After the divorce we moved to Switzerland. My mother, brother and Z. I don't feel American. I don't even feel black. I suppose that's very lucky for me even though Freud says there's no such thing as luck. Just what you make. PAUL takes the pasta off the boil and drains it, plopping the pasta into a brightly colored bowl. OUISA, FLAN and GEOFFREY sit at the counter, transfixed. \nOUISA Does Freud say that? PAUL holds out three dishes heaped with food. \nPAUL Here's dinner. All ready. \nOUISA Shall we move into the dining room? OUISA opens double doors leading into \nTHE DINING ROOM. \nThis room has not been in use for a while. The overhead chandelier is very bright and harsh. A sewing machine is in the corner there. Bookkeeping items at one end of the long table. Nineteenth century Victorian mythological paintings hang.on the walls. FLAN adjusts the rheostat to dim the lights in the chandelier. \nOUISA Don't look at the sewing machine. FLAN sweeps the bill things off the table onto a chair. OUISA opens the sideboard and takes out four linen place mats and silverware and quickly sets the table. PAUL takes out matches and lights the Haitian card\"e'Yabra. FLAN runs into the living room and returns with a vase of flowers. THEY smile at the appearance of the sudden party in this wonderful room. THEY sit down. THEY eat. Surprise. It's delicious. \nPAUL Is everything okay? FLAN, OUISA and GEOFFREY Mmrmmm .. yes. \nGEOFFREY This is the best pasta I've ever - \nOUISA The best! \nPAUL My father insisted we learn to cook. \nFLAN Isn't he from Jamaica? There's a taste of-- \nGEOFFREY The islands. \nPAUL Yes. Before he made it, he ran four restaurants in Harlem. You have good buds! \nGEOFFREY See? Good buds. I've never been complimented on my buds- \nR \nFLAN I am astonished! \nPAUL leans back and watches them happily. \nOUISA Where's yours? \nPAUL The cook never eats. \nFLAN The more for us! THEY all laugh. PAUL leaves the room abruptly. FLAN, OUISA and GEOFFREY look at each other. FLAN stands. \n", "test2_id": 1879, "test3_input": "ELIZABETH Do you think it'll hurt me? \nRICK What'll hurt you? \nELIZABETH My resemblance to Liv Ullmann.

He sold a Cezanne to the Japanese and made millions and he can give me money without her knowing it. PAUL lets out a whoop and leaps up onto the bed with RICK and ELIZABETH in it and begins jumping up and down. \nELIZABETH I knew it! PAUL goes to a corner which contains a single mattress on the floor and begins to pack his few things back in the plastic bags. \nPAUL I'm moving out of here! \nELIZABETH reaches for her robe and pulls it on. RICK pulls on his jeans. \nELIZABETH You can't! \nRICK No! RICK and ELIZABETH surround PAUL to make HIM stay.

But I could wire it back to you. \nPAUL goes into the john to take his toothbrush and razor. ELIZABETH pulls on her dress and straightens out her hair. \nRICK (QUIET) We could lend it to him for a week. \nELIZABETH (QUIET) We can't. If something happens - \nRICK (QUIET) You're like his stepmother. These women holding on to all the purse strings. \nELIZABETH No. We worked too hard to save that. PAUL comes out of the john.

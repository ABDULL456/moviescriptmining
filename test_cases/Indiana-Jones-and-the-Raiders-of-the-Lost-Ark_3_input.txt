Out in the court, Shliemann has regained his eyesight. Now he crouches, scanning the scene desperately for Indy. He looks into the remains of the Tabernacle and spots the empty altar. Beyond it, the unoccupied posts where Marion was bound. 
At the entrance to the second train tunnel, Indy and Marion struggle to lift the Ark into a mine car. Marion has the submachine gun slung over her back. The Ark drops heavily into the bottom of the car. The noise attracts the attention of five water-carrying Nazis. They see what's going on and reach for their side-arms. Indy grabs Marion, pulls her in front of him - as though to use her as a shield - and flips the submachine gun, still on her back, toward the Nazis. 
He opens fire, turning Marion's body so he can mow all five down. 
Shliemann spins around and looks at the tunnel entrance. He points at Indy and Marion, who have just hopped into the mine car with the Ark. 
SHLIEMANN Stop them! Kill them! 
A dozen Nazis spin and look at the mine car. Marion is just leveling the submachine gun. Indy pushes forward the throttle and the mine car moves toward the tunnel, picking up speed. As the Nazis raise their guns to fire, Marion and Indy both open up, peppering the area with lead. As the mine car is about to disappear into the tunnel - 
INDY (to Marion) Get down! 
As the car disappears, bullets pock the entrance of the tunnel. Shliemann runs up with three Nazis. They jump into the next mine car and take off, disappearing into the tunnel. 
Over at the burning stack of goods, some terrified fire- fighters scurry away as the burning pile of general goods falls over onto the stack of cartridge boxes. The wooden boxes immediately start burning. Many of the Nazis just want to get out of there, but a couple of disciplined OFFICERS are trying to salvage the situation. They point to the far side of the court, the walls are lines with oil and gas drums. 
OFFICER We must cover the drums! Protect them from the bullets! 
INTERCUTTING INDY AND MARION WITH SHLIEMANN AND THE NAZIS 
We see a most extraordinary pursuit. This tunnel is of identical design to the first, except more twisty. This early section goes slightly uphill, as though headed for the summit of a rollercoaster. The low cross beams and the higher sections in between are causing the Nazis to alternately stand and duck in their efforts to get a clear shot at the lead car. One German times it wrong and gets whacked. Indy in unhappy with the speed of his car and he's right, the Nazis are moving faster and gaining. When both cars are in the same high section, the Nazis blast away at them. The noise is deafening, with barking guns, splintering rock, and twanging ricochets contributing to the din. As Marion fires a return volley low over the Ark, Indy kicks at the throttle, convinced it is jammed. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER 
The Officers are directing the placement of every moveable item in front of the oil drums. Desks, crates, chairs, food, all are heaped in front of the fuel. All the workers cast frequent nervous glances back at the burning cartridge boxes across the court. Suddenly the worst begins to happen at the cartridge boxes. Hundreds of thousands of live cartridges begin exploding, flying around the court like shrapnel. Hot lead begins to zing off the exposed fuel drums, leaving big dents. 
INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY 
The car with Indy and Marion looks almost sluggish compared to the pursuing Nazi car as they both make their way into an usually long straightaway. Marion discards her empty submachine gun as Indy kicks at his throttle and casts a worried look back at Shliemann. 
Shliemann, sensing victory, smiles evilly and carefully takes aim. Indy and Marion will be easy targets until they reach that approaching low cross beam, which is the crest of the rising tunnel. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER - CLOSE ON FUEL DRUM 
A fuel drum, already pocked by bullets is finally penetrated by high velocity hot lead. It explodes in a ball of flame. And then its neighbor. Then all is exploding flame. 
INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY 
Shliemann and his cohorts hear the explosions behind them and look back that way. 
Indy kicks the throttle one more time and it goes! Their car doubles its speed and shoots under the low cross beam at the same instant as - 
A huge dragon of all-consuming fire shoots up the tunnel behind the Nazis, catches their car and incinerates Shliemann and his men. The tunnel collapses in this section, burying the fried Nazis forever. 
INT. TRAIN TUNNEL 
Indy and Marion look back at the low cross beam as the last tongue of flame makes it there and then is doused by falling rock and dirt. They look at each other, then turn their attention back to their own predicament. Their mine car is going incredible fast as it moves into a downward section of wildly twisting tunnel. 
MARION Slow it down! 
Indy is already pulling the throttle. It moves easily. Unfortunately, it is no longer attached to the motor. The mine car is out of control. After several moments, far ahead, appears a circle of bright daylight - the end of the tunnel! It approaches at a frightening rate. Indy reaches out and grasps Marion's hand. They exchange looks and then turn to look ahead. 
THEIR POV 
We're taking this last stretch with them. It's a familiar nightmare. It has to do with a rollercoaster that ends suddenly and disastrously. The shocking brightness of sunlight rushes up to engulf us, blinding us in its glare. 
EXT. THE ISLAND - END OF TRACKS, DOCK

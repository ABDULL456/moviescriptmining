Elizabeth and Walsingham advance into the wide empty nave, followed by the Queen's ladies and the guards. Bess is now back in her place among the ladies. E LIZABETH Ship builders are being recruited in Spanish ports at double wages. The sea wall at Dover is cracking. There's no money to rebuild our defences.

From all round echoes the same sound, of axe on timber. \nPHILIP (V.O.) `Elizabeth! You are leading the souls of your people to Hell! Turn back! Marry me, and save England!'I spoke to her just as I speak to you now. \now we see the royal carriage riding through mature forest, accompanied by a mounted entourage. \nIN THE CARRIAGE - The king, Philip II, the Infanta and Father Robert Reston. \nPHILIP But she did not listen.

England is lost to darkness, Father. I bring light. \nWIDE NOW - We see the carriage and the royal party crest a hill, and there is revealed an awesome sight: the forest has been felled as far as the eye can see. Great piles of cut timber dot the ravaged landscape. Everywhere men are at work lopping branches from felled trees. Wagon teams haul immense trunks away. Fires burn stacks of lopped branches, and the smoke rises up into the empty sky. I N THE CARRIAGE - On Reston's face as he stares at the fires. He speaks half to himself, out of the depths of his own fanatical certainty. \nRESTON The light of purifying fire. \nHe turns and fixes the king with his intent gaze. \nRESTON My time has come, majesty.

CHARTLEY HALL, GARDEN - DAY A small yapping Skye terrier is barking at a LAUNDRESS, who is handing over a letter, folded small, to a sharp-faced middle-aged French lady's maid, ANNETTE. The laundress curtseys and leaves. \nINT. MARY STUART'S QUARTERS, CHARTLEY HALL - DAY The terrier scampers ahead of Annette to its mistress, MARY STUART, who sits embroidering a pink satin petticoat. She is a handsome but bitter woman in her mid-thirties. Round her stands her small retinue of three ladies and a chaplain. \nMARY This is so pretty I'm inclined to send it as a present to my dear cousin Elizabeth. She holds up the delicate work to show her ladies. \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p.12 \nMARY (CONT'D) It is an intimate garment, of course. But even Elizabeth must have the occasional intimate moment. Annette reaches her mistress and kneels before her, holding out the letter. \nANNETTE My Queen. \nMary lays down her needlework and takes the letter from her and reads it for herself. \nMARY Our friends write to give us hope. \nANNETTE (low) Soon England's true believers will rise up against the bastard usurper Elizabeth, and slit her throat, and throw her down to hell. \nMARY That's enough, Annette. (But she loves it.) Slit her throat? Please. \nANNETTE And when the bastard usurper is dead, my lady will be queen. \nThe chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning. \nThe Warden of Chartley Hall, SIR AMYAS PAULET, enters the room. He is soberly dressed, but has charming manners, and is clearly susceptible to his handsome ward. Mary turns to him at once with a teasing smile. MARY Here's my noble jailer, come to smack my hand. She holds out one hand to be smacked. The other hand holds the letter out of sight. MARY Have I sinned again, sir? PAULET No, no, my lady. Unless beauty is counted a sin. \nDoubleGoldenrod - 25 July -p.13 PAULET(cont'd) (Kissing her hand) I come to pay my respects. MARY Oh, you jailer. I don't trust you. PAULET Not jailer, my lady, please. Warden. Protector. Friend. You are the Queen's guest. Mary signs to her ladies. One of them brings her the embroidery, discreetly receiving in exchange the hidden letter. \nMARY See how I pass my time in my lonely prison. PAULET Charming, ma'am. Distractingly charming. She holds the intimate garment against her body. Paulet seems to be too fascinated by it to notice he is being \nduped. \nMARY \nSuch a pretty undergarment. But for whose eyes? \nDoubleGoldenrod - 25 July -p.14 \nINT. ARMOURER'S SHOP, LONDON - DAY A pistol is being loaded: a fiddly process involving a powder horn, wadding, and an iron ball the size of a hazelnut. ARMOURER (O.O.V.) So what's it for, my young friend? Not for shooting rabbits, I'm guessing. SAVAGE We live in dangerous times. \nARMOURER We do indeed. \nSavage moves close as if to study the loading process. We see the two of them talking from outside the window. \nSAVAGE (very low) The conspiracy gains strength. \nTell our master one of the circle has already gained access to the court. The Armourer nods. He hands the pistol to Savage. Savage takes it and leaves. Immediately after, a man enters and walks up behind the now seated Armourer. The Armourer turns round. RESTON I ask for your forgiveness. Moving with speed, he seizes the Armourer's head, twists it to one side, and snaps his neck. Reston walks quietly out of the store. \nEXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY A crowd of eager SPECTATORS and WOULD-BE COURTIERS has gathered, held back by a line of guards, all hoping to attract the attention of the Queen when she appears. This is the route from the Presence Chamber to the Chapel Royal. \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p.15 Every Sunday the Queen processes here, and crowds gather to see her.

Am I right? \nBESS He is certainly charming, my lady. \nELIZABETH There are duller professions. And what is it he hopes to gain by his charms? \nBESS He hopes for glory in his New World. He dreams of building a shining city. \nELIZABETH \nWhich I'm to pay for, no doubt. (Beat) You like him, don't you? BESS It's refreshing to meet a man who looks to a world beyond the court.

MARY STUART'S QUARTERS, CHARTLEY HALL - DAY Mary Stuart holds her pet dog in her arms, listening to Annette, who kneels before her. \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p. 35 \nMARY Dismissed? On whose orders? \nShe looks up at the laundress, who stands red-eyed and snuffling, with a guard by her side. \nMARY Do stop snivelling. \nANNETTE The Warden, my lady. \nMARY The Warden? My Warden? \nAs she speaks, Sir Amyas Paulet enters. Mary's voice becomes seductive. \nMARY What have you done now, you bad man? Sent away my laundress? How am I to have clean clothes? Or do \nyou want me to go about naked? \nPaulet smiles at the notion of Mary naked. PAULET That was not my motive, ma'am. \nMuch though - (Thinking better of it) Your laundress was found to be \ncarrying letters in her washing. Not her job, I think. \nMARY How am I to send my intimate letters? PAULET Through me. MARY And you will read them. PAULET With respectful admiration. MARY Am I to have no privacy? PAULET No. Beneath the charm, steel. MARY You disappoint me, sir. \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p. 36 \nPAULET The Queen orders these measures for your protection. MARY The Queen! Am I not a Queen too? What if I wish to write a love letter? Is Elizabeth to be sent a copy? Is she so starved of lovers that she must feed on mine? PAULET The Queen grieved when your husband died, ma'am. As she grieved when your second husband \ndied. And the third. If there is a possibility of a fourth - \nMARY Tormentor! Is that Elizabeth's order too? That you torment and mock me? She turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter, haughty, not deigning to look back. MARY They say she's a beautiful woman. \nIs she so very beautiful? \nPAULET \nI don't presume to comment on the Queen's person. MARY She's called the virgin queen. Why is that, sir? Can it be that \nno man will have her? \nMary changes mood again, thinking it more politic to keep the Warden under her spell. She waves Annette and the laundress away. \nMARY My friend, forgive me. You are my friend, are you not? PAULET I am your servant, ma'am, and your admirer. \nMARY I shall send no more letters. I shall stay here quietly, in my prison.

For weeks you see nothing but the \nhorizon. All round you. Perfect, and empty. Your ship is small - tiny - a speck in such immensity. \nINT. PRIVY CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Walsingham is talking to Elizabeth about matters of state. We are on her face, and we can see that she hears nothing \nof what he tells her. Her mind is all on Raleigh's voice. \nRALEIGH (V.O.) You live with fear, in the grip of fear - fear of storms, fear of sickness on board, fear of the immensity. What if you never escape? How can you escape? There's nowhere to go. So you must drive your fear down, deep into your belly, and study your charts, and watch your compass, and pray for a fair wind - and hope. \nINT.

ELIZABETH (sharply) Let them wait! (to Raleigh) Go on, Mr Raleigh. You were hoping. \nHatton bows and leaves, frowning. \nRALEIGH At first it's no more than a haze on the horizon, the ghost of a haze, the pure line corrupted. But clouds do that, and storms. So you watch, you watch. \nINT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS, WHITEHALL PALACE - NIGHT \nElizabeth dances with Raleigh. As they dance, his voice continues over; and Elizabeth seems to be listening to him. \nRALEIGH (V.O.) Then it's a smudge, a shadow on the far water. For a day, for another day, the stain slowly spreads along the horizon, and takes form - until on the third day you let yourself believe. You dare to whisper the word - land! \nThe music ends, and the dance finishes. \nElizabeth is seated now - it's later in time. Raleigh is speaking intently to her, and she is captivated.

That - that - is the New World. \nB \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p. 39 \nA short silence. Elizabeth is absorbing what he has told her. \nELIZABETH (V.O.) The Queen does not have a private life. \nINT PRESENCE CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Elizabeth is on the throne. The Archduke Charles and his entourage face her. The court fills the room. Elizabeth makes her formal response to the young Archduke. \nELIZABETH The Queen lives for her people. You will therefore forgive me, sir, if after much thought and prayer I decline your offer of marriage. \nThe Archduke, barely able to conceal his relief, turns to the Austrian ambassador. \nARCHDUKE CHARLES (Can I go home now?) \nElizabeth inclines her head, trying not to smile. \nELIZABETH (Go home, my friend. Don't be in a hurry to grow old. Youth is so very precious.) \nElizabeth rises and takes the Archduke's arm as they start to leave the chamber. Bess, in her wake, finds an opportunity to speak softly to Raleigh. \nBESS Well?

With so many secrets, you can never quite tell who's on who's side, until the game ends. \nHe takes the hollow bung out of one pocket and admires it. \nPAULET My own invention. Theatrical, but effective. My master has every letter you've written. \nMARY Your master? \nPAULET Walsingham. \nNow she knows it's over. She begins to weep. \nMARY Traitors.

PRISON - DAY Walsingham has a lamp in his hand. He moves slowly along a passage, bowed down by a sense of failure. \nHe directs the light of his lamp through cell bars onto a face. The Jesuit. Reston looks back, unafraid. \nWALSINGHAM Ready to die, I see, Jesuit. \nRESTON I have done what I was sent to do. \nWALSINGHAM Why was the gun not loaded? \nReston doesn't answer. Walsingham gazes at him a moment longer. Then he moves the lamp along. There, shackled and white-faced, sit Babington and Ramsay. Walsingham studies their faces. \nWalsingham carries his lamp down the passage and shines it into the next cell. Here lies a man in chains, huddled on the floor. He looks up as the light falls on him. William. \nWalsingham looks down on the pitiful sight. W ALSINGHAM What was the Jesuit sent to do? \nWILLIAM To kill the Queen. You know it. You know everything. \nWALSINGHAM Not quite everything. \nWILLIAM I've told you all I know. Go ahead and kill me. Take what's left of me. I don't care any more.

Her eyes are hazel. They say she's beautiful. But people lie. They say I am beautiful. A dismissive shrug. Clearly she does not think herself beautiful. BESS She plotted to kill you.

TITLE SEQUENCE P                                         1 Painted images of the Elizabethan age - \nCAPTION \nA world divided by religious hatred. \nThe new Protestant faith is spreading. \nBodies burned on a pyre - men writhing under torture - a momentary half-recognisable face, gaunt and staring - FATHER ROBERT RESTON. \nCAPTION The most powerful ruler in Christendom, Philip of Spain, has sworn to return all Europe to the Catholic faith. \nImages of rival monarchs Philip and Elizabeth in court paintings: stiff, formal, imperious. \nCAPTION Only England stands in his way: a weak impoverished nation ruled by a woman. \nFinally images of God in judgement, as if speaking to his chosen servant. \nCAPTION Philip prepares to obey the will 2             of his God. \nINT. PRIVATE CHAPEL, ESCORIAL PALACE, SPAIN - DAY             2 \nBn ascetic-looking man dressed in black kneels in a small plain chapel, in virtual darkness. PHILIP II, King of Spain bows his head low, abasing himself before his God. T S/I CAPTION: \nscorial Palace, Spain, 1585. \nNow, slowly, he raises his head. His eyes open, and we see there the glow of a new certainty. God has spoken to him. \nPHILIP (I hear. I obey. My Lord and my God.) \nMay 1 Blue Draft--p.2 \nINT. HALLWAY/SALON, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. On his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered; among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he enters, all kneel. \nHis eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling, heads bowed before him. His gaze falls on one who wears the plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the face we glimpsed in the opening montage. He speaks to all. \nPHILIP (God has made his will known to me. The time for our great enterprise has come.) \nThe Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but disciplined satisfaction. He murmurs softly to himself. \nRESTON At last. \nCathedral bells ring out. The cheers of a crowd are heard through the open windows. \nThe king passes out onto the salon's first-floor balcony. \nEXT. BALCONY, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY Hot sunlight. Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and the CROWD in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer. The Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him. Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's power. \nPhilip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his people's adoration. \nEXT. THAMES - DAY A ripple of light on the water. A blur of approaching colour. \nMay 1 Blue Draft--p.3 The ROYAL BARGE is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape: its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting bright shards of shining water in the sunlight. P eople passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling, cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out. \nTwo young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the Queen. \nThey are BABINGTON and SAVAGE. \nOver this an insistent voice: \nMay 1 Blue Draft7 \nELIZABETH (to Walsingham) That's where you and I differ, Walsingham. I find the impossible far more interesting. (to Bess) And good legs. You'll want good legs. \nBESS And sweet breath. \nELIZABETH So that you can kiss him without choking. \n(to Walsingham) There must be any amount of princes in undiscovered lands \nacross the sea. Find me an honest one of those. \n9A                                                                9A INT. ST PAUL'S CATHEDRAL - DAY \nThe royal party enters the Cathedral. Elizabeth and Walsingham advance into the wide empty nave, followed by the Queen's ladies and the guards. Bess is now back in her place among the ladies. E LIZABETH Ship builders are being recruited in Spanish ports at double wages. The sea wall at Dover is cracking. There's no money to rebuild our defences. I don't need advisers to tell me my business. \nWALSINGHAM They care for your safety, majesty. The threats to your person are real. \nELIZABETH And they know very well that if I fall, they all come tumbling down after me. \nShe goes on to the steps at the foot of the altar, and kneels to pray. As she kneels she holds out one hand behind her, not looking round. Bess steps forward, and taking her hand, kneels and prays with her. \nDouble Pink revision 18 July - p.8 \nELIZABETH Let's pray, Bess. May we have wisdom not to fear shadows in the night, and courage when the day of danger truly dawns. \nON ELIZABETH as she prays. \nOMITTED \nDouble Pink revision 18 July - p.9 \nEXT THE TYGER, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY Raleigh is standing on the prow of a war-ship as it cuts through the water toward the white cliffs of Dover. The ship and its sailors have been at sea for many months, and it shows. Raleigh shouts to his Sailing-Master. \nRALEIGH Let England know we're back, Mr Calley. CALLEY \nMaster Gunner, run out starboard and tie-off. A broadside from the bow. MASTER GUNNER Run out and prime. From the bow number one gun, on my word - \ndischarge! Two -- Three-- Four. \nCanon fire echoes over the distant white cliffs. \nINT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT ON ELIZABETH - Imperfectly reflected in a mirror in the soft candlelight. Her ladies are putting her clothes away. E Bess begins the process of stripping away her make-up. \nlizabeth studies her true face as it comes into view. \nELIZABETH Lines round my mouth. Where did they come from? \nBESS Smile lines, my lady. ELIZABETH Smile lines? When do I smile? With that she smiles, and sees Bess's answering reflected smile. ELIZABETH Now you have smile lines too. \nN \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p.10 \nHer smile fades. She gazes at her now naked face, vulnerable in the mirror. \nINT. QUEEN'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT 13A                                                               13A The royal bed, immense and ornate. Elizabeth lies here small, awake, and alone. \nPHILIP `Elizabeth! The angels weep for you, Elizabeth! Why do you close your ears to the voice of your loving God?' \nEXT. FOREST, SPAIN - DAY 13B                                                               13B Foresters at work felling great trees, working rhythmically, in pairs. From all round echoes the same sound, of axe on timber. \nPHILIP (V.O.) `Elizabeth! You are leading the souls of your people to Hell! Turn back! Marry me, and save England!'I spoke to her just as I speak to you now. \now we see the royal carriage riding through mature forest, accompanied by a mounted entourage. \nIN THE CARRIAGE - The king, Philip II, the Infanta and Father Robert Reston. \nPHILIP But she did not listen. She made me a speech about the virtues of virginity. Me! Virginity! She has brought this on herself. P hilip surveys the scene through the carriage window with a shudder. \nR \nYellow Revision May 22 - p.20 One of the Spaniards recognises him and murmurs to the Ambassador; who speaks angrily to the Queen. \nDON GUERAU Majesty, this man is a notorious pirate. \nELIZABETH Indeed? \nDon Guerau points to the hampers. \nDON GUERAU Spanish treasure, stolen from Spanish ships. You will see. R aleigh kneels before the Queen. Elizabeth gestures for him to rise. \nELIZABETH Well, sir. Who are you? \nRALEIGH Walter Raleigh, your majesty. \nELIZABETH \nAh, yes. Raleigh. I've heard of your voyage. What's your rank? RALEIGH A gentleman of Devon. \nELIZABETH What do you want? \nRALEIGH The honour to be in the presence of my Queen, whose radiant beauty is the boast and glory of the English people. \nELIZABETH Yes, well, here you are. \nALEIGH I'm just returned from the New World, majesty. I have claimed the fertile coast in your name, and called it Virginia, in honour of our Virgin Queen. \nElizabeth raises her eyebrows. \nELIZABETH Virginia? And if I marry? Will you change the name to Conjugia? \nA royal joke. Her entourage laughs dutifully. \nYellow Revision May 22 -p.21 \nRALEIGH I ask for your gracious permission, majesty, to return to the New World with your royal warrant, to found a colony under the laws and protections of England. E lizabeth's eye has fallen on the native Americans. \nELIZABETH Who are they? \nRALEIGH Americans, majesty. They long to be your newest subjects. \nHe beckons Calley to lead Wanchese and Manteo forward. \nELIZABETH Have they no ruler of their own? \nRALEIGH None to match England's Queen. \nElizabeth gazes at the natives. She holds out her hand. Unaware that he's meant to kiss the Queen's hand, Manteo, takes it and shakes it. A gasp from the watching courtiers. But Elizabeth accepts the courtesy. \nELIZABETH These gentlemen are welcome. See that they're treated well. \nCalley hurries them away before worse happens. \nRALEIGH I also come bearing gifts for your majesty, from the New World. \nHe beckons to the servants to bring the baskets. Don Guerau steps forward. \nDON GUERAU The fruits of piracy, majesty. The true property of the realm of Spain. \nELIZABETH Let's see, shall we? to Raleigh) What do you bring me? \nRALEIGH Mud, and leaves. \nR \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p.22 \nMembers of the court share suppressed smiles. \nEXT. WOOD - DUSK \nYoung Savage stands alone among trees, shivering, white- faced, half-mumbling, half-singing an endless prayer. He holds a pistol with which he means to kill himself. But he can't do it.         S AVAGE (singing) Salve regina, mater misericordiae, vita dulcedo et spes nostra salve... \nIn a clearing nearby three men sit round a fire. They are young Catholic fanatics - Babington, Ramsay, and FRANCIS THROCKMORTON. A fourth man stands before them, his back to us, watching Savage. At first we don't see who he is. \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p.25 \nRESTON (O.O.V.) His weakness endangers us all. He can't go on with us. And we can't leave him behind. \nNow the man turns and looks intently at Babington, and we see he is Robert Reston; no longer in the clothes of a priest. \nRESTON Who will help him? \nBabington rises. Reston nods his approval. Babington goes off through the trees. Reston and the others follow a little behind. \nSAVAGE singing) Ad te clamamus, exsulaes filii Evae. Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle - \nHe sings on as Babington approaches him, seeming no longer to know what's happening. Babington takes the pistol from his hand. \nBABINGTON Make your peace with God. \nSavage stares, and suddenly realises what Babington means to do. Terror overwhelms him. \nSAVAGE No, Tom! Don't kill me! I don't want to die! \nNow he's blubbering with fear. Babington is shaken by this, and can't shoot. \nReston begins to pray aloud. \nRESTON Si ambulam in medio umbrae mortis, non timebo mala - \nThe others join in with the words of the well-known psalm. Babington too joins in, now weeping. \nRESTON AND OTHERS Quoniam tu mecum es, Domine. Virga tua et baculus tuus, ipsa me consolata sunt - B ANG! Savage falls dead. \nH \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p.26 \nINT. WALSINGHAM'S HOUSE - EVENING Walsingham enters his private home, and gives his hat and cloak to his servant. \nSERVANT Visitor waiting, sir. \nWalsingham frowns. He climbs the stairs to the door of his study. There, pacing nervously, is his younger brother WILLIAM, a middle-aged student. Walsingham's scowl disappears. He opens his arms wide. WALSINGHAM \nWilliam! \nWILLIAM \nHello, Francis. \nThey embrace. Then Walsingham pushes him back to take a good look at him. WALSINGHAM You look terrible. Don't they feed you in Paris? How are your studies? Learned the secrets of the universe yet? \nWILLIAM Not yet. \nWALSINGHAM These are dangerous times to be questioning the ways of God. You must take care of yourself. \nWILLIAM My needs are simple. \nWALSINGHAM You'll dine with us? You'll lodge with us? \nis daughter MARY appears at the top of the next flight. \nMARY WALSINGHAM William! \nShe comes tumbling down and into his arms. She's an eager innocent 20-year-old, much loved by her father. \nWILLIAM Look at you! All grown up. \nbe joined in love. But now that I am bathed in the radiance of your glory, I am overwhelmed. I am \nconquered. I die. Only your love, great Elizabeth, can restore me to life. C ourtiers exchange smiles at his efforts. The Spaniards sneer openly. But Elizabeth takes the charade with due gravity. \nLIZABETH Your highness does me great honour. Shall we eat our dinner? It should prove almost as restorative as my love. \nRaleigh enters the Great Hall, trailed by Calley, as the dinner gets under way. They join the much larger group who simply stand and watch. Royal meals are in part a spectacle for the court. A JESTER moves from group to group, playing pranks on the guests. \nGreen Revision May 25 - p.29A \nRaleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very well; as the glances of several court ladies show. He catches Bess's eye and they share a smile. \nCOURT LADY So tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your sea battles - how do you sink an enemy ship? You shoot holes in its sides, I suppose. \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p.30 \nRALEIGH No, ma'am. A sunk ship is of no value. The object is to capture and command. \nCOURT LADY And how do you do that? \nRALEIGH Surprise. Speed. Irresistible violence. \nCalley, listening, rolls his eyes. \nElizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side, glances towards Raleigh, and sees him flirting with the court ladies. Then back to the young Archduke, who has hardly touched his food. \nELIZABETH I think you're not as accustomed as I am to eating in public. I have a secret. lowering her voice) I pretend there's a pane of glass - eine Glasscheibe - between me and them. S he moves one hand before her face, indicating an imaginary pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the object of her attention is also Raleigh. \nELIZABETH They can see me, but they can't hear me, or touch me. You should try it. \nShe beckons to Bess. \nELIZABETH Bess. \nBess comes forward. \nELIZABETH (low) He interests me. Talk to him. \nBESS Him, my lady? \nELIZABETH Him. \nBess turns and looks across towards Raleigh, as he flirts with the court ladies. \nGreen Revision May 25 - p.31 \nElizabeth turns back to her guest. \nELIZABETH His highness is tired after his journey. \nThe young Archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply. \nARCHDUKE CHARLES No man can be tired in the presence of so lovely a Queen. E lizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in German. \nELIZABETH (You play the game very well, my young friend. But don't you \nsometimes feel an overwhelming desire to say what you're really thinking?) The Archduke's eyes open very wide. He glances at Elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile. \nARCHDUKE CHARLES (I daren't even think what I'm really thinking.) ELIZABETH (You're thinking, perhaps, that \nyou would far rather be home.) \nARCHDUKE CHARLES (You're very wise, madame.) \nHe's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it. \nRaleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies. COURT LADY I adore the natives you brought back with you. I don't suppose you could get one for me? They're not dangerous, are they? RALEIGH That depends what you propose to do with them. COURT LADY I'd dress him up in mulberry- coloured silk and have him walk behind me, carrying my cloak. \nGreen Revision May 25 - p.31A \nTheir eyes meet, both aware of the current of mutual attraction. \nR \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p. 40 \nBESS I expect I'll think of something. \nBess hurries after the Queen. The Austrian entourage is just leaving as the Queen turns. \nELIZABETH Mr. Raleigh. \nINT QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY 35A                                                              35A Elizabeth and Raleigh walk together around the perimeter hallway, dwarfed by vast murals. \nELIZABETH I like your immensities. Your ocean is an image of eternity, I think. Such great spaces make us small. Do we discover the New World, Mr Raleigh, or does the New World discover us? \nRALEIGH You speak like a true explorer. \nELIZABETH I like you, Mr Raleigh. \nRALEIGH And I like you. \nShe stops and turns to meet Raleigh's eyes. She's not used to such direct replies. Bess is watching them. \nELIZABETH You know, of course, that when I like a man, I reward him. \nALEIGH I have heard that. \nELIZABETH And what have you to say about it?       R ALEIGH Reward my mission, majesty, not me. \nELIZABETH Is the mission not the man? RALEIGH Leave me free to like you in return. That can be my reward. \nELIZABETH Go on. RALEIGH I think it must be hard for so great a Queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself. \nElizabeth stares. This is a little too close to the truth. \nELIZABETH Now you become dull. \n35B                                                              35B EXT. WINDSOR GREAT PARK - DAY \nHorses racing, hoofs pounding over the grass, manes flying - Two riders hurtle between the trees, down a woodland ride, neck and neck- \nElizabeth and Raleigh are racing against each other, faces glowing, laughing, abandoned to the breakneck speed of the moment. \nRaleigh is winning now, first by a head, then by a length. At the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk. \nRALEIGH Mine! \nElizabeth shakes her head, unable to speak. \nELIZABETH (out of breath) You have - the stronger horse. \nY         RALEIGH ours carries the lighter load. \nELIZABETH The Queen does not give way to others. Raleigh stops his horse. Elizabeth rides on up to him and then past him. Raleigh secretly spurs his horse. The horse springs forward, ahead of her. RALEIGH Whoa! Whoa! (at Elizabeth, reigning in the horse) Forgive me, majesty. My horse doesn't know his place yet Elizabeth looks at him, amused, intrigued. \n43A \nELIZABETH Have you ever known your place, Mr. Raleigh? She urges her horse forward, forcing Raleigh to catch up. ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I'm surprised you're not married yet. RALEIGH I'm a sailor, majesty. ELIZABETH And can sailors not be lovers? RALEIGH (with a smile) \nMust lovers be husbands? \nELIZABETH Ah, I see. You like love better \nthan marriage. That I understand. \nRALEIGH \nYour majesty is not eager to be married? \nBESS Majesty? RALEIGH I'm afraid that's not possible. Women bring bad luck on board ship. \nELIZABETH Oh, do they? \nRALEIGH Lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room, for months at a time - Men have needs. A beautiful woman like you would drive us all mad. \nELIZABETH (amused) Men have needs? \nnce again Elizabeth meets Raleigh's eyes. Then she breaks away, feeling the contact is dangerous. \nELIZABETH Then let them stay on land and see to their needs. (to Bess) Mr Raleigh is eager to sail away to his infant colony, Bess. We must persuade him to stay a little longer, mustn't we? \nINT. HALLWAY, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY 42A                                                                 42A Raleigh is leaving. Walsingham has been waiting for him. He falls into step beside him. WALSINGHAM Mr Raleigh. A word of advice. The Queen chooses to show you favour. You naturally wish to take advantage of that. (Beat) Don't ask for too much. RALEIGH You think all I want is money. WALSINGHAM I hope all you want is money. \nBuff Revision 6th June - p.44A \nRALEIGH You think I'm a cynical adventurer, with little breeding and less education. You're wrong. I'm a cynical adventurer with little breeding and an excellent education. WALSINGHAM I begin to see why the Queen likes you. \nINT/EXT. LONDON HOUSE - NIGHT A soft knock on the door. Francis Throckmorton goes to the window and looks out. \nTHROCKMORTON'S POV - In the street outside, a woman with her head covered. \nHe unbolts the door. T \nHROCKMORTON Bess? \nTwo men burst in and seize him. They are Agents 4 and 5. Beyond, the woman - not Bess - is hurrying away. \nThrockmorton struggles. A single sharp blow, and he folds to the ground. \nREPOSITIONED AS SCENE 35B \nOMITTED 44A-B                                                          44A-B \nINT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY Multiple images of Elizabeth, naked. Strange misty refracted glimpses of her face, her body. \nA bath of steaming hot water has been placed in the Queen's private quarters, and screened by mirrors. The Queen is in the bath, being washed by her ladies. B ess Throckmorton has the job of holding the Queen's hair out of the water as she's washed. She strokes the soft tresses as she holds them, unaware that Elizabeth can see her in the mirror. \nThen she looks up and catches Elizabeth's eyes, and stops in confusion. \nELIZABETH No, don't stop. I like it. \nBess returns to her gentle caresses, and Elizabeth to her thoughts. \nELIZABETH Is it true, Bess? That I've never known the simple pleasure of being liked for myself? \nBESS I hope you believe that I like you for yourself, my lady. ELIZABETH Is anybody ever liked just for themselves? Are you? I doubt it. Men like you because you're pretty. And because you have the ear of the Queen. \nE \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p. 50 \nBESS No doubt, my lady. \nELIZABETH Him too. He likes you because he wants my favour. You do realise that? \nBESS Yes, my lady. \nELIZABETH And the other thing too, of course. But all men want that. Male desire confers no B         distinction. \ness strokes Elizabeth's hair in silence. Then she sees Elizabeth gazing at her in the mirror. \nLIZABETH I envy you, Bess. You're free to have - what I can't have. You're my adventurer. Don't be afraid. It's all over so soon. \nINT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY \nA man who looks like a shop assistant sits grabbing a quick lunch. He's the TORTURER. Nearby on a blood-stained bench lies a huddled half-naked figure, trembling uncontrollably. It's Francis Throckmorton. He's neither manacled nor guarded. His body is so broken it's not necessary. \nWalsingham enters. The torturer jumps to his feet. Walsingham goes to Throckmorton. He gazes at him, shaking his head. He's getting too old for this dirty business. \nA knife at his throat. A quick slash. \nThe killer, Agent 3, waits one more moment, to be sure the job is done. The torturer slumps, still standing, against the wall. \nAgent 3 slips away. \nOn the flag stones, blood trickles down to mingle with the urine. \nINT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Now there are guards everywhere. The whole palace is on heightened alert. \nlizabeth sweeps out of the Privy Chamber into the Great Hall, accompanied by the Spanish Ambassador on one side and Walsingham on the other. Her entourage scuttles behind. \nELIZABETH What do you know of the Enterprise of England, Ambassador? \nDON GUERAU The Enterprise...? Forgive me, your majesty... \nELIZABETH It's a plan for the invasion of my country. Two armies landing on the coasts of Sussex and - \nWALSINGHAM Norfolk. \nELIZABETH And Norfolk. Mary Stuart is to be set free, and placed on the English throne. \nMay 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 54 ELIZABETH(cont'd) I am to be assassinated. Does any of this sound familiar? \nDON GUERAU I know nothing of any invasion plans. \nELIZABETH I refer to this plan as the Enterprise of England. It should more accurately be called `la Empresa di Inglaterra', because it's a Spanish plan. The plan of your king, my one-time brother-in- law, Philip II, to attack my country. \nThe Ambassador decides the best form of defence is attack. D ON GUERAU Attack? It is my country that is under attack! Your so-called pirates attack our merchant ships daily! Do you think we don't know where their orders come from? The whole world knows that pirates sail up the Thames all the way to the royal bed! \nELIZABETH (exploding) You will leave my presence, sir! Go back to Spain! Tell Philip that I don't fear him, or his priests, or his armies. Tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us, we're ready to give him such a bite he'll wish he'd kept his hands in his pockets. \nDon Guerau sees no point in further pretence. He speaks with pride and contempt. \nDON GUERAU You see a leaf fall, and you think you know which way the wind blows. But a wind is coming, madam, that will sweep away your pride. H e bows and turns to go. Elizabeth's words blaze after him. \nELIZABETH I too can command the wind, sir. I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare, if you dare to try me! \nMay 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 55 \nShivering with rage she turns round, and there's Raleigh. Her fury overflows onto him. \nELIZABETH What are you staring at? Lower your eyes! I am the Queen! \nShe sweeps past him without a further glance. \nON RALEIGH - Watching Elizabeth go. A shake of his head. Enough. \nEXT. SHIPYARD, SPAIN - DAY Immense stacks of cut timber as far as the eye can see. Skeletons of new ships, big ships, rising in the great yard. Hundreds of ship-builders at work. T his is what the forests were felled for: a brand-new fleet is being built. \nTiny figures in the wide scene: the royal party appears. Philip has come to see progress for himself. As he and his entourage tour the construction site, one of his ministers briefs him on the latest developments in England. \nSPANISH MINISTER (It can't be denied that we've lost the advantage of surprise. A large part of our plans has come into their hands.) \nPHILIP (The Jesuit is still at liberty?) \nSPANISH MINISTER (We understand so, majesty.) \nPHILIP (He knows his business. We've lost nothing.) \nThe workmen kneel to Philip as he passes. \nPHILIP (Tell the carpenters to go on working. No one is to stop for me. The fleet must be ready to sail in a month.) \nSPANISH MINISTER (Impossible, majesty!) \nPHILIP (If this is God's work, God will make it possible.) \nC \nEXT. GALLOWS - DAY CLOSE ON Throckmorton as the noose is tightened round his neck. His face is ravaged by the tortures he's endured, but he holds his head high, ready for death. Round him an unseen crowd bays for blood. \nCROWD (O.S.) Hang! Hang! Hang! \nRESTON (V.O.) Lord have mercy on the soul of your servant, who gives his life for your eternal truth... \nINT. SECRET ROOM - DAY A candle-lit cellar, where Reston and the conspirators pray for the condemned man, heads bowed. \nabington bursts in. \nBABINGTON Francis is about to die! We must act!      R ESTON He enters heaven as a soldier returns home victorious from war. BABINGTON Why don't we strike? What's he dying for? Is this part of your plan? \nReston puts his hands on Babington's shoulders and gently but irresistibly forces him down to pray with them. RESTON Lord, be with us as the end approaches. \nMay 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 60 RESTON(cont'd) We will not fail in our duty. We look beyond death, to eternity. \nEXT. GALLOWS - DAY Throckmorton drops. His body flails. His neck breaks. A roar of bloodlust from the crowd. \n(RENUMBERED- SEE SCENE 51A) 55A                                                              55A \nINT.

He stands in \nsilence, watching her as she prays. He hears her sigh. \nHe takes a step towards her. She hears, startled. Turns and sees him. BESS Oh! It's you! \nRALEIGH I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. \nBESS My prayer's done. \nShe rises to her feet. \nRALEIGH Something has distressed you. \nBESS And I thought I prayed in silence. \nRALEIGH So you did. \nShe turns away, unable to look him in the eyes. \nBESS A man was hanged today.

I was afraid that he was lying to me. But what if - what if it was true? He sees the horror in her eyes, at the thought that she has sent an innocent man to his death. Tears rise to her eyes. BESS \nWhat if I was his last hope? What if I was the one person he thought he could trust? RALEIGH If you knew him well, you will have sensed the truth. BESS I thought so. RALEIGH He was hoping to use you. You did \nwhat you had to do. \nShe can no longer hold back the tears. RALEIGH There, now. He wipes away a tear from her cheek. In desperate need of comfort, she throws herself into his arms. He holds her \nclose as she sobs. \nRALEIGH We're all mortal, Bess. We do what we can. He strokes her cheek. She meets his eyes, filled with gratitude. She takes the hand that touches her face and moves it to her lips. She kisses it, still holding his eyes. He draws her back into his arms, and they kiss. Suddenly they're kissing eagerly, greedily, their long pent- up passion released at last. \nOMITTED \nA \nC \nMay 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 62 \nEXT.

WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY \nRaleigh puts an arm round Calley. \nRALEIGH She spoke to me. You have to give me that. \nCALLEY Oh, I do. The Queen spoke to you. One word - but she spoke. \nRALEIGH Two words. \nCALLEY You're made. A dukedom at the very least. \nRALEIGH Did you see the girl behind her? I've been at sea too long. \nINT. GREAT HALL, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY The Great Hall is crowded with competing factions. A group of Spaniards, led by their Ambassador, DON GUERAU DE SPES, stand watching everyone else with haughty disdain. \nW \nYellow Revision May 22--p.17 An architect waits to present details of a building project. Petitioners wait vainly, in the hope of catching the Queen's eye. Howard and Hatton are in attendance. Walsingham stands by the Queen's side, briefing her in a low murmur for her ears only. ALSINGHAM Thousands are dying every day of famine in Ireland. Another rebellion is a distinct possibility. A courtier is holding a portrait which he shows to the Queen. COURTIER Francis of Valois, majesty. \nHATTON \nBrother to the king of France, majesty. WALSINGHAM \nFrance is in religious turmoil. It would be unwise to engage with their instability.

Walsingham murmurs on. \nWALSINGHAM We still need to keep France out of the arms of Spain. ELIZABETH Let me think on it. (to Howard) What if enemy ships should sail up the Thames? Can the docks be closed? \nHOWARD Not closed, majesty. But the gun positions here, and here, have full command of the channel. The courtier displays a second portrait. COURTIER King Erik of Sweden, majesty. \nYellow Revision May 22--p.17A \nELIZABETH What again? WALSINGHAM Still madly in love with you. ELIZABETH Still mad, you mean. (Looking around). Where's Bess?

ANTECHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Bess Throckmorton is late. She comes running through the crowd of lesser petitioners who wait in the hope of gaining access to the Queen. She passes Calley, the two native Americans, and a group of sailors holding large hampers. Raleigh is trying to persuade the doorkeeper to let him past. DOORKEEPER You'll have to see the Lord Chamberlain, sir. He indicates a portly man surrounded by petitioners, beyond \nthe open doors to the inner rooms. \nRALEIGH \nHow am I to see him if you won't let me through? DOORKEEPER \nYou must wait for him to come out, sir. \nRALEIGH And when will he come out? \nDOORKEEPER There's no way of knowing that, sir. The doorkeeper stands aside for Bess. She recognises Raleigh, and throws him a smile before rushing past. RALEIGH (as if to Calley) \nI had less trouble than this boarding a Spanish ship! Everything is easier when you can kill people. \nINT. GREAT HALL, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Bess curtseys before Elizabeth; who shakes her head at her. \nELIZABETH Late again, Bess. \nBESS I beg your majesty's forgiveness. \nELIZABETH Given.

BESS He's rather sweet. \nELIZABETH More your age than mine, Bess. How old is he? \nHATTON Young... I believe, majesty. An \nAustrian alliance would keep France quiet. WALSINGHAM And it would put Philip on a leash. Elizabeth looks across at the Spaniards. \nELIZABETH I become almost enthusiastic. to Hatton) Send for him. (to Bess) Where is he, then? \nBess understands. She bobs and hurries to the door. \nELIZABETH (to Walsingham) How much longer do you think I can play this game? \nWALSINGHAM Virginity is an asset that holds its value well. \nLIZABETH Diplomatically speaking. \nYellow Revision May 22 - p.19A \nRaleigh now enters with Calley, the native Americans and court servants carrying hampers. \n", "test2_input": "ELIZABETH He's a sweet boy. I don't want him hurt by your schemes. \nINT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY Bess is reading to Elizabeth. Elizabeth watching her, her mind elsewhere. \nELIZABETH I suspect him of being a professional charmer. Am I right? \nBESS He is certainly charming, my lady. \nELIZABETH There are duller professions. And what is it he hopes to gain by his charms? \nBESS He hopes for glory in his New World. He dreams of building a shining city. \nELIZABETH \nWhich I'm to pay for, no doubt. (Beat) You like him, don't you? BESS It's refreshing to meet a man who looks to a world beyond the court. ELIZABETH So it is. We shall let him come again. \nINT. MARY STUART'S QUARTERS, CHARTLEY HALL - DAY Mary Stuart holds her pet dog in her arms, listening to Annette, who kneels before her. \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p. 35 \nMARY Dismissed? On whose orders? \nShe looks up at the laundress, who stands red-eyed and snuffling, with a guard by her side. \nMARY Do stop snivelling. \nANNETTE The Warden, my lady. \nMARY The Warden? My Warden? \nAs she speaks, Sir Amyas Paulet enters. Mary's voice becomes seductive. \nMARY What have you done now, you bad man? Sent away my laundress? How am I to have clean clothes? Or do \nyou want me to go about naked? \nPaulet smiles at the notion of Mary naked. PAULET That was not my motive, ma'am. \nMuch though - (Thinking better of it) Your laundress was found to be \ncarrying letters in her washing. Not her job, I think. \nMARY How am I to send my intimate letters? PAULET Through me. MARY And you will read them. PAULET With respectful admiration. MARY Am I to have no privacy? PAULET No. Beneath the charm, steel. MARY You disappoint me, sir. \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p. 36 \nPAULET The Queen orders these measures for your protection. MARY The Queen! Am I not a Queen too? What if I wish to write a love letter? Is Elizabeth to be sent a copy? Is she so starved of lovers that she must feed on mine? PAULET The Queen grieved when your husband died, ma'am. As she grieved when your second husband \ndied. And the third. If there is a possibility of a fourth - \nMARY Tormentor! Is that Elizabeth's order too? That you torment and mock me? She turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter, haughty, not deigning to look back. MARY They say she's a beautiful woman. \nIs she so very beautiful? \nPAULET \nI don't presume to comment on the Queen's person. MARY She's called the virgin queen. Why is that, sir? Can it be that \nno man will have her? \nMary changes mood again, thinking it more politic to keep the Warden under her spell. She waves Annette and the laundress away. \nMARY My friend, forgive me. You are my friend, are you not? PAULET I am your servant, ma'am, and your admirer. \nMARY I shall send no more letters. I shall stay here quietly, in my prison. With you. \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p. 37 \nOMITTED \n", "test2_true": "It begins with a journey. You must cross an ocean. \nINT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY Elizabeth listens attentively, her eyes looking far away \ninto the distance, as Raleigh tells of his adventures. \nRALEIGH \nCan you imagine - can you feel - what it is to cross an ocean? For weeks you see nothing but the \nhorizon. All round you. Perfect, and empty. Your ship is small - tiny - a speck in such immensity. \nINT. PRIVY CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Walsingham is talking to Elizabeth about matters of state. We are on her face, and we can see that she hears nothing \nof what he tells her. Her mind is all on Raleigh's voice. \nRALEIGH (V.O.) You live with fear, in the grip of fear - fear of storms, fear of sickness on board, fear of the immensity. What if you never escape? How can you escape? There's nowhere to go. So you must drive your fear down, deep into your belly, and study your charts, and watch your compass, and pray for a fair wind - and hope. \nINT.

Lost! Imagine it. Day after day, staring west, the rising sun on your back, the setting sun in your eyes, hoping, hoping - Sir Christopher Hatton enters. \nHATTON Majesty, the Archduke and the court are waiting. ELIZABETH (sharply) Let them wait! (to Raleigh) Go on, Mr Raleigh. You were hoping. \nHatton bows and leaves, frowning. \nRALEIGH At first it's no more than a haze on the horizon, the ghost of a haze, the pure line corrupted. But clouds do that, and storms. So you watch, you watch. \nINT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS, WHITEHALL PALACE - NIGHT \nElizabeth dances with Raleigh. As they dance, his voice continues over; and Elizabeth seems to be listening to him. \nRALEIGH (V.O.) Then it's a smudge, a shadow on the far water. For a day, for another day, the stain slowly spreads along the horizon, and takes form - until on the third day you let yourself believe. You dare to whisper the word - land! \nThe music ends, and the dance finishes. \nElizabeth is seated now - it's later in time. Raleigh is speaking intently to her, and she is captivated. RALEIGH Land. Life. Resurrection. The true adventure. Coming out of the vast unknown, out of the immensity, into safe harbour at last. That - that - is the New World. \nB \nMay 1 Blue Draft - p. 39 \nA short silence. Elizabeth is absorbing what he has told her. \nELIZABETH (V.O.) The Queen does not have a private life. \nINT PRESENCE CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Elizabeth is on the throne. The Archduke Charles and his entourage face her. The court fills the room. Elizabeth makes her formal response to the young Archduke. \nELIZABETH The Queen lives for her people. You will therefore forgive me, sir, if after much thought and prayer I decline your offer of marriage. \nThe Archduke, barely able to conceal his relief, turns to the Austrian ambassador. \nARCHDUKE CHARLES (Can I go home now?) \nElizabeth inclines her head, trying not to smile. \nELIZABETH (Go home, my friend. Don't be in a hurry to grow old. Youth is so very precious.) \nElizabeth rises and takes the Archduke's arm as they start to leave the chamber. Bess, in her wake, finds an opportunity to speak softly to Raleigh. \nBESS Well? Are you satisfied with the Queen's favour? \nRALEIGH She listened as if she understood me. \nESS Then I shall expect some gratitude. R \nALEIGH What do you want? \n", "test3_input": "MARY Yes? \nPAULET The assassin seized - \nMARY Yes? \nPAULET The Queen unharmed - \nMARY Unharmed? \nPAULET And you, ma'am, are under arrest. \nHe has led up to this deliberately, and now stands smiling at her utter confusion. The man who looked like a fool has been playing his own game all along. \nMARY Me? What has any of this to do with me? \nPaulet makes a sign. Burton the brewer comes through the gate: Walsingham's man after all. P AULET That's the trouble with intrigue, isn't it? With so many secrets, you can never quite tell who's on who's side, until the game ends. \nHe takes the hollow bung out of one pocket and admires it. \nPAULET My own invention. Theatrical, but effective. My master has every letter you've written. \nMARY Your master? \nPAULET Walsingham. \nNow she knows it's over. She begins to weep. \nMARY Traitors. I'm surrounded by traitors. Who am I to trust? \nMay 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 75 \nShe picks up her little dog, weeping bitterly. \nMARY Only my little one... \nINT. PRISON - DAY Walsingham has a lamp in his hand. He moves slowly along a passage, bowed down by a sense of failure. \nHe directs the light of his lamp through cell bars onto a face. The Jesuit. Reston looks back, unafraid. \nWALSINGHAM Ready to die, I see, Jesuit. \nRESTON I have done what I was sent to do. \nWALSINGHAM Why was the gun not loaded? \nReston doesn't answer. Walsingham gazes at him a moment longer. Then he moves the lamp along. There, shackled and white-faced, sit Babington and Ramsay. Walsingham studies their faces. \nWalsingham carries his lamp down the passage and shines it into the next cell. Here lies a man in chains, huddled on the floor. He looks up as the light falls on him. William. \nWalsingham looks down on the pitiful sight. W ALSINGHAM What was the Jesuit sent to do? \nWILLIAM To kill the Queen. You know it. You know everything. \nWALSINGHAM Not quite everything. \nWILLIAM I've told you all I know. Go ahead and kill me. Take what's left of me. I don't care any more. All my life you've had everything and I've had nothing. So finish it. There's a better world waiting for me. We'll all be judged in the end, brother. Even you. \nWalsingham gazes down on this pitiful show of pride. \norchid revision 28 June -p. 76 \nWALSINGHAM You're no martyr. You weren't even much of a murderer. Go back to France. Back to your dreams. Never let me hear of you again. \nWalsingham turns away. As he goes we see what he won't show William: that the hurt of the betrayal is almost more than he can bear. \nHe goes back up the passage. As he passes Reston, the Jesuit calls out softly. \nRESTON Send me home. \n", "test3_true": "DON GUERAU (They have letters in Mary Stuart's own hand. All England cries out for her death.) \nPhilip nods as he listens. All goes to plan.

QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Elizabeth sits deep in thought, Bess by her side. Shadows all round. \nELIZABETH They say she's taller than me. Her hair is chestnut in colour. Her eyes are hazel. They say she's beautiful. But people lie. They say I am beautiful. A dismissive shrug. Clearly she does not think herself beautiful. BESS She plotted to kill you. ELIZABETH Yes, it's true. I've read her letters. I too was a prisoner \nonce. I've feared for my life. I've done terrible things - just to live. BESS So do we all. ELIZABETH I can be merciful. But she \nprotests her innocence, and that is a lie. Why will she not admit she has wronged me? BESS She'll go on lying til you cut \nout her traitor's heart. \nElizabeth stares at her in surprise. ELIZABETH You used to be gentler, Bess. BESS I used to be quieter, majesty. \nINT. GREAT HALL, FOTHERINGAY CASTLE - DAY Mary Stuart sits before her accusers in the Great Hall of this sombre castle, her new prison. She wears black, but she is proud, composed, and beautiful. She is faced by a commission of lords, appointed to try her. \nW \norchid revision 28 June -p. 77A \nMARY Who are you to sit in judgement on me? By what authority do you condemn a Queen? God alone has made me what I am. He is my only judge. Raise your law above God's law, and what law remains? In your vanity and ignorance you set loose the monster of misrule. You know neither who you are nor what you do. But I know who I am. I die as I have lived - trusting in the mercy of my God - a Queen. \nINT. PRIVY CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - NIGHT \nElizabeth raging at Walsingham. \nELIZABETH Must die? Mary Stuart must die? Where is it written? Who dares to \ngive orders to the Queen? \nALSINGHAM Majesty, this is no time for mercy - \nELIZABETH Don't preach at me, old man. Look at you! You can hardly stand. Go home to your wife. Go home to your bed. \nWALSINGHAM The law must have its way. \norchid revisions 28 june - p.78 \nELIZABETH The law is for common men, not for princes. \nWalsingham sees there's no point in persisting. He bows and withdraws. \nINT. HALLWAY, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Raleigh comes hurrying towards the Queen's quarters. Bess sees him approaching and comes out to meet him. They speak low, not wanting the ever-present guards to hear them. \nBESS Thank God you've come. I've never seen her so distressed. She's been alone in her rooms since morning. She'll see no one. \nRALEIGH Has she asked for me? \nBESS No. But she needs you. I know she does. \nRaleigh takes Bess's B hand in his, discreetly. \nESS Go to her. \norchid revisions 28 june - p.79 \nINT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Elizabeth sits alone, deep in thought. \nRaleigh enters, and comes before her.

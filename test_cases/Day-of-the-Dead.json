{"train": "DAY OF THE DEAD (The original script) by George A. Romero \nFADE IN: \n1\tEXT. THE EMPTY STREET OF A CITY - DAY \nNo people. A FEW CARS AND TRUCKS are parked at odd angles, abandoned. A TITLE FADES IN, one phrase at a time. \nFIVE YEARS... SINCE THE DEAD FIRST WALKED. \n2\tEXT. THE CITY - DAY \nWe hear THE SOUND OF A STRONG WIND. DEBRIS flutters through the streets. A LARGE ALLIGATOR slithers into frame, stops and looks around. \nMONTAGE: as MORE GATORS explore the empty streets, knocking over GARBAGE CANS, upsetting the MANNEQUINS in A DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW. A GATOR crawls out through the open doors of AN ABANDONED BANK. LOOSE BILLS are dragged along under the animal's tail. They flutter away on the WIND. \n3\tEXT. THE CITY - DAY \nGATORS crawl over A '79 CADELLIC. A FEMALE SKELETON sits slumped over the steering wheel. In the back a BABY'S BONES are strapped into AN INFANT'S SAFETY SEAT. One of the gators THUMPS its tail maddeningly against the windshield. ANOTHER TITLE APPEAR: \nFLORIDA - 1987 \n4\tEXT. THE CITY - DAY \nCLOSE ON A SECTION OF PAVEMENT as we hear THE SOUND OF SLUGGISH FOOTSTEPS approaching. A SHADOW appears at the bottom of the frame. It gets longer and takes on the shape of a man. \nTIGHT ON THE AFTERNOON SUN, blinding us. Into the FOREGROUND lurches THE FIGURE which cast the shadow. Glare obscures all facial detail until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball in the sky. Then we see its hideous, dead eyes, its blue-grey colour, the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped away. This is a ZOMBIE! A MUSIC CHORD SOUNDS and THE MAIN TITLE APPEARS: \nDAY OF THE DEAD \n5\tEXT. THE CITY - DAY \nHEAD CREDITS ROLL over A MONTAGE: the CITY STREETS are now populated by the WALKING DEAD. In every shape, size and colour they wander, without purpose, up and down the avenues, in and out of buildings. The city is theirs, they have inherited the place. Man, in his human form, seems to be gone. \nAs the CREDITS END, we CUT TO: \n6\tEXT. A MAIN STREET - DAY \nWe are looking down from a HIGH ANGLE. The corner of A TALL BUILDING is in the FOREGROUND. A CORPSE is dangling from A NOOSE. It's been dead for some time. It's mostly bone now, its blackened flesh picked clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats. A SIGN flaps against its chest cavity. Its hurriedly scrawled message reads: TAKE ME, LORD! I LOVE YOU! \nTHE ROPE BREAKS suddenly and THE CORPSE FALLS out of frame. \n7\tEXT. THE STREET - DAY \nWe're at GROUND LEVEL now...SMACK!!! THE CORPSE HITS THE PAVEMENT and SHATTERS as though made of potter's clay. BONES bounce over a wide area. THE SIGN is carried off by the WIND. \n8\tEXT. AN ABANDONED MARINA - DAY \nTHE SIGN gallops across the grass of A HARBOUR PARK towards the water where A FEW DERELICT BOATS sway in the WIND. \nSlowly, THE SOUND OF A MOTOR FADES IN. \n9\tEXT. THE MARINA (CLOSER ANGLE) - DAY \nA FISHING BOATS, old and sea-worn, chugs into the harbour. \n10\tEXT. THE MARINA (CLOSE ON THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY \nThere are people on board, THREE MEN AND TWO WOMEN. They look like guerilleros from somewhere in Latin America. They're heavily armed, unshaven, covered with months worth of jungle crud. They are obviously exhausted. They gaze up to the city. Their deep-sunken eyes are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair. \nTONY Another dead place. I tol' you. Let's get out to the islands. \nMIGUEL The radio signals were coming from this area. \nTONY sees the action. He dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilot's controls. \nWith a lightning move, MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt. She wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKER'S CHEST. The man staggers back, screaming. MARIA breaks away and runs across the dock. THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly. \nMARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM. She tumbles forwards onto the decking. \nTONY reacts, OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC. \nBULLETS RIP INTO THE ATTACKERS CHEST: HE FALLS OUT OF THE TRAWLER onto the dock, but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him, mean-looking desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD. \nTONY ducks as low as he can. He grabs the controls and pilots the fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman. \n18\tEXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY \nMIGUEL, SARAH AND CHICO react to the gunfire. They draw their WEAPONS and look for cover. \nThey are at the far end of the dock, their backs to the sea. There is a WORK SHED nearby. BULLETS WHIZ past them as they charge towards the wooden structure. They make it there safely and they begin to RETURN FIRE. A gun battle ensues between the two groups. \n19\tEXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY \nMARIA, her ARM BLEEDING, rolls off the dock and into THE FISHING BOAT. TONY guns the engine and the boat pulls out into open water. \nTHE ATTACKERS try to FIRE AT THE ESCAPING BOAT but they are forced to duck BULLETS which RICOCHET OFF THE TRAWLER pinning them down. \n20\tEXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY \nMIGUEL'S RIFLE is in his right hand. His left hand clings to the frame of AN OPEN WINDOW on his side of the shed. There's a SUDDEN, STARTLING MUSIC STING and, with it, A ZOMBIE appears inside the open window. Grotesque and drooling dark SALIVA, its hungry mouth lunges at MIGUEL'S left arm. ITS TEETH TEAR A LARGE STRIP OF FLESH OUT OF THE ARM six inches above the wrist. \nMIGUEL screams. He pulls away from the creature, his terrified eyes staring at the BLEEDING WOUND. A zombie bite means infection and almost certain death. \nTHE ZOMBIE leans out through the open window, its hands clawing the air trying to reach MIGUEL. SARAH pulls A GIANT .45 from her holster belt. BULLAMN! BULLAMN! BULLAMN! She FIRES three rapid shots. \nTHE SKULL OF THE ZOMBIE INDENTS IN FRONT like a hard-boiled egg shell that's been whacked with a spoon bowl. BLACKENED BLOOD AND BRAIN MATTER FLIES OUT OF THE BACK where the bullets exit. The creature falls, destroyed. \n21\tEXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY \nSARAH acts quickly. She lunges towards CHICO and snatches A MACHETE out of his belt. CHICO shows concern but he's busy RETURNING FIRE at THE ATTACKERS on the trawler. \nSARAH I have to stop the infection... Querrida... MIGUEL looks into SARAH'S eyes. He has started to tremble. A cry of primal panic is gurgling up in his throat. With a sudden move, SARAH slams her RIFLE BUTT into the side of his head with all her might. He reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall. His eyes roll but he stays on his feet, still conscious. \nCHICO steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of MIGUEL. WHAP! He slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross. MIGUEL still stands. WHAP! He slugs him again. WHAP! Again. Finally, MIGUEL collapses into the man's arms and CHICO lays the limp body down on the deck. \nBUDDABLAM! RATTATATTATATTATATT! THE ENEMY, sensing an upper hand, starts FIRING WITH MORE INTENSITY. CHICO steps away from MIGUEL and SENDS SOME LEAD BACK their way. \n22\tEXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY \nSARAH is crying. It's not weakness. She's crying for MIGUEL, crying for his pain. But she doesn't hesitate in what she has to do. She crouches over the BITTEN ARM and raises the MACHETE over her head. \nTHUCK! SHE CHOPS AT THE ELBOW JOINT with all her strength. THE BLADE BITES DEEP BUT DOESN'T CUT THROUGH. SHE LIFTS IT AND CHOPS AGAIN AND AGAIN....THUCK! THUCK! Then SHE DIGS AROUND, searching for the joint the way she might on a turkey drumstick. Finding the spot, SHE PUSHES DOWN WITH BOTH HANDS, leaning all her weight on the top edge of the blade. TEARS are running down her cheeks when THE BIG KNIFE FINALLY.... THUMMMPPP!....CUTS THROUGH TO THE DECKING. \nRepulsed, angry, SARAH SWEEPS THE SEVERED FOREARM AWAY WITH THE BLADE the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat. BLOOD IS SPURTING OUT OF THE STUMP at an alarming rate. SARAH has to act quickly again. \nWhile CHICO continues to RETURN FIRE at the enemy, SARAH swings herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears inside the place. \n23\tINT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY \nThe place is dark and cluttered (oars, bait buckets, fishing gear, life preservers, tools, paints, varnishes). SARAH snatches up AN AXE HANDLE. \nTHE ZOMBIE that bit Miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open. Its hand is jogged, startingly, when SARAH grabs A BOTTLE OF PAINT THINNER from the floor beside the corpse. \nFrom out of the shadows...A HAND! It grabs SARAH'S ankle. She kicks violently and pulls away. ANOTHER ZOMBIE is crawling across the floor. ONE OF ITS LEGS IS MISSING AND THE OTHER IS BADLY DAMAGED. \nSARAH draws her .45 and BULLAMM! BULLAMM! SHE PUMPS TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CREATURE'S BRAIN. \nTHE BOAT noses into a swamp water backwash. Tall reeds and cypress moss camouflage it completely. It's at though the boat is sailing right onto dry land. \nSHOCK CUT TO: \n35\tEXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE INLET - DAY \nTHWOCK! CLOSE ON A MACHETE. The blade chops into the top of a coconut. \nCHICO drinks the milk. SARAH sits on a nearby rock, her RIFLE AND A BACK-PACK full of supplies strapped over her shoulders. \nMIGUEL, his madman's eyes wide with excitement, is trotting urgently from spot to spot where a spectacular specie of sub-tropical plant grows. There are hundreds of them, six-feet tall and flowering. Their red-gold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells down. \nMIGUEL DATURA!!! DATURA!!! MIRA. DATURA!!! \nCHICO What's he saying? SARAH shrugs, not knowing. CHICO looks down at her, empathising. \nCHICO His madness....could be from shock. \nSARAH No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know. (She speaks softly, matter-of-factly) Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him. \nMIGUEL DATURA!!! DATURA!!! DATURA METEL!!! \n36\tEXT. THE INLAND JUNGLE - DAY \nTHE GUERILLEROS hack their way through thick undergrowth with MACHETES. MIGUEL is ineffectual. He lags behind the others who are doing trailblazing. THE SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE, excited by the intruders, fill the close, humid air, sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque, sometimes startling. \n37\tEXT. A SWAMPY AREA - DAY \nALLIGATORS lurk and SNAKES slither among the reeds. A FOURTEEN FOOT GATOR opens its jaws wide making a SOUND LIKE ESCAPING STEAM. CHICO draws his PISTOL but SARAH reaches out to grab his hand. \nSARAH No. No shooting. Not until we're sure we're alone on this island. \nMIGUEL No. No, thank you. No ice. Straight up, please. No ice. Thank you. \nMIGUEL'S eyes roll up into his head. His knees buckle. SARAH grabs him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the muddy swamp water. CHICO comes to help. \n38\tEXT. THE SWAMP - DAY \nTHE TWO drag MIGUEL to the edge of dry land. They flop him onto his back and SARAH puts her canteen to his lips. \nMIGUEL NO ICE, I SAID!!! NOOOOO ICE!!! \nHe slams his good hand against the canteen, knocking it away. It plops into the marsh water, its contents lost. \nMIGUEL Burn the church. Kill the priest and burn the church. Burn.... \nHis mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out. He squirms for a moment, then he seems to fall asleep. \nCHICO looks down at him. Unable to help, he moves off towards solid ground and disappears in the thick brush. After a time, SARAH follows after him. \n39\tEXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY \nCHICO is at the edge of a clearing when SARAH reaches him. His eyes are wide, frightened by what they see. \nIn the ground before them there's AN ENORMOUS IRON PLATE, fifty feet by ten, all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns. \nSARAH What is it? \nCHICO I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno. \nSuddenly there's A GREAT RUMBLING, like the giant gears and pistons of a drawbridge being activated. The iron plate shudders and starts to move, downward, into the earth. SARAH AND CHICO duck into the nearby jungle. \n40\tEXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY \nThey seem to come from everywhere. Soon there are twenty or more. Most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests, the same type as worn by the platoon. These are solid colours, some white, some blue. None are red and none have orange circles. \nAs THE ZOMBIES push in closer they seem to get agitated. They start growling and reaching out. THE MEN WITH THE CATTLE PRODS poke at the more unruly creatures and ZAPPING SOUNDS can be heard. \nThe creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the \"Good Humour\" men. From inside their freezer cartons those men produce GREAT BLOODY CHUNKS OF RAW MEAT. THE ZOMBIES docilely take the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a more private supper. \n50\tEXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY \nSARAH What is that? Could that be....? \nBehind her, CHICO gets the dry heaves. He slams his hand into his mouth to keep from making noise. \nSARAH No. They must have gotten them to accept....other things. They wouldn't be feeding them with....they wouldn't... \n51\tEXT. THE CLEARING - DAY \nThe man in command of the platoon is obvious, strutting around while others do the dirty work. This is CAPTAIN RHODES. He's conscienceless, the low of the low, and a weasely-looking guy, to boot. He watches the operation almost hoping for trouble. (He loves to torture disobedient zombies.) \nBehind him, their AUTOMATICS ready, are SEVERAL TROOPERS especially assigned to protect the captain. One of these troopers is TOBY TYLER, a good guy. TOBY is revulsed by the scene in the clearing. He drops his head, almost gagging. RHODES notices. \nRHODES You'll get used to this, Tyler. It's the only way. They don't bite the hand that feeds. TOBY looks up. He can't conceal his contempt for the captain. RHODES reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND distracts him. \nONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok. THE ZAPPERS poke at the creature but that just makes it angrier. \nRHODES GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS! BRING IT HERE! \nONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END. He drops the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting into the dead flesh on the thing's neck. The pole is long enough to control the creature while keeping it out of reach. \n52\tEXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY \nSARAH watches, repulsed but fascinated. CHICO is still fighting the heaves. Without warning, A ZOMBIE looms up directly behind CHICO. The man jumps forward, terrified. He crashes into SARAH who spins and sees the danger. \nTWO MORE ZOMBIES appear. Then A THIRD. These have no vests. They're rag-tag, bad ass and hungry as hell. ONE OF THEM grabs SARAH. She manages to pull away but behind her CHICO panics. He raises his RIFLE and...RATTATATTATATT! \n53\tEXT. THE CLEARING - DAY \nRHODES hears the GUNFIRE. He seems pleased. He grins. \nRHODES We have visitors. Let's go men. \nHe moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS. He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager. ELECTRONIC BEEPS, like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a different pattern. \nTHE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly. They draw their PISTOLS and go marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull apes. RHODES' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh. \nRHODES Hah! If only the rest of you ladies would obey orders the way they do. \n54\tEXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY \nTheir cover blown, SARAH now raises her RIFLE. BUDDABUDDA!!! \nTHE SECOND ZOMBIE'S HEAD TURNS TO RED PULP and the thing pitches forward, dead. \nCHICO FIRES and THE THIRD ZOMBIE IS DESTROYED. \nSuddenly there is DISTANT FIRE, from the clearing. BULLETS WHIZ through the brush. The guerilleros duck for cover. \n55\tEXT. THE CLEARING - DAY \nTHE RED COAT ZOMBIES, shuffling forward abreast in a line, have OPENED FIRE. It's a grisly parody of foot-soldiering. The creatures are unsteady on their feet, their hands shake when they squeeze the stiff Army-issue triggers. BULLETS FLY this way and that, most of them grossly off target. \nRHODES THAT'S IT, YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME ! YOU FOUL- SMELLING, PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS! I TOLD YOU I'D FIND YOU REAL ACTION, DIDN'T I? YOU CORRUPTION! YOU FILTH! YOU'RE LEARNING! YOU'RE GETTING BETTER....GETTING BETTER...GETTING BETTER, YOU SCUM! \nThe trooper beside TOBY is another young man whose nickname is TRICKS. He and TOBY exchange glances as they trudge along behind the captain and his zombie red coats. Their eyes tell us that they both think Rhodes to be insane, which of course he is. \nCHICO, in a state of blind panic, takes off along the edge of the thicket, his WOUND BLEEDING PROFUSELY. \n61\tEXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY \nCHICO breaks through some brush to find himself face-to-face with TOBY TYLER'S GROUP OF SOLDIERS. He stops, reverses course, and ducks into a cluster of palms. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS FIRES. RATTATATTATATTATATT!!! \nBULLETS RIP THE PALM FRONDS APART. There's a scream and CHICO somersaults out into view. NEW WOUNDS BLEEDING ACROSS THE CENTER OF HIS CHEST. \n62\tEXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY \nSARAH realises that this is her last chance to escape. She takes advantage of the confusion and the NOISE and bolts into the jungle at a full run. \n63\tEXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY \nCHICO is still alive. He fumbles for his HOLSTERED PISTOL but before he can draw it THREE TROOPERS are on top of him. TRICKS tromps a boot on his hand. TOBY TYLER aims his RIFLE squarely at his sweating brow. \nCHICO Yes...yes, do it...please...you can't let me die this way...please. Destroy me. A bullet...in the head...I don't want to become...one of...one of them. \nTOBY looks down at the man, at his TERRIBLE WOUNDS, clearly fatal ones. TOBY clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his RIFLE. His finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when CAPTAIN RHODES strides up behind him. \nRHODES Take his weapon, Tyler. \nTOBY is startled by the voice at his back. He turns towards the captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating.. \nRHODES Take his gun, ass hole. He still has the strength to pull a trigger. \nReluctantly TOBY obeys, reaches down for CHICO'S PISTOL. \nCHICO Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please. RHODES Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up. \nTHE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under the arms. TRICKS stoops to help. CHICO screams in agony when he is moved. TOBY lunges in to help the others, thinking to ease the man's pain. \nRHODES They can handle it, Tyler. You've been buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's one you're gonna love. We've got two dead. Cut the heads off and get the bodies underground to the refrigerators. Fast. It's a hot day. \nTOBY grimaces but doesn't speak. He turns and moves briskly towards the clearing. RHODES watches him go. \n64\tEXT. THE CLEARING - DAY \nTOBY nears the spot where MIGUEL lies sprawled in A POOL OF BLOOD. RHODES calls from the edge of the thicket. \nRHODES Tyler. Just our men. Not him. \nTOBY looks down at the remains of the one-armed guerillero. \nRHODES His head stays where it is. He and I never really had the chance to get acquainted. When he comes back...I'll get another shot at it... Ha ha ha ha... \n65\tEXT. THE CLEARING - DAY \nCLOSE ON CHICO. He's dangling from A ROPE which is tied over a tall tree, his feet ten feet off the ground. \nZOMBIES wander here and there. They've all received their rations. The picnic is breaking up now. Occasionally one of them gets surly but it doesn't amount to anything. SOLDIERS stand ready with ELECTRIC PRODS, OTHERS with GUNS. \nPARAPHERNALIA is being packed away. MEN CARRY EQUIPMENT in the direction of the elevator. \nRHODES walks up beneath where CHICO is hanging. He's careful not to step in too close. He doesn't want to get any DRIPPING BLOOD on his uniform. \nCHICO Please....shoot me. \nRHODES And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it? \nCHICO is weeping now. With a found spurt of energy he struggles against the rope. No use. It only brings pain. \nRHODES After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM! \nJOHN I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you. \nMcDERMOTT We better get as far away from here as we can. We can work the other side of the island tonight. \nJOHN (explaining) We found nine entrances to the Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole thing near charted yet. That's what we was doin' out here today. Huntin' for entrances. \nMcDERMOTT Come on. They find a Bee done like this and they'll know somebody's been out walkin' where they shouldn't have been. \nJOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the good words over the corpse of the \"white-coat\". \nSARAH The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth. \nJOHN How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two. \nSARAH Curse? \nJOHN What is it if it ain't a curse? \nSARAH It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain. \nJOHN That sounds like a curse to me. \nSARAH We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet! \nJOHN I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here. \nSARAH Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch. \nJOHN That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now. \nSARAH Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic. \nJOHN You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail? \nSARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not sure whether to believe him. \nJOHN We didn't see the exact spot but we know about where you landed. But we ain't ready to take you there. Not yet. You see...we need guns, too. \nSARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks for a moment...not very long...then she turns and starts off into the jungle. \nSARAH I can find it myself. I didn't come that far. \nJOHN Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie. \nSARAH No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here! \nSARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over her shoulder she disappears. \nMcDERMOTT We can't let her go, John. \nJOHN We don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy. (He's joking.) \nMcDERMOTT The hell we don't! But that's not what I mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out there alone. That or she'll be firin' off her automatics and wakin' up the troops. \nJOHN We'll split up. Billy, you go with Spider. Just an hour or two tonight, that's all. Rhodes might have extra guards on after all the commotion. We'll meet up at number six and go back home together. \nMcDERMOTT God save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll never make it. \nTHE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through the darkening underbrush. \n78\tEXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - NIGHT \nDARKNESS has fallen. The jungle is as black as the background on a velvet painting. \nRHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old who needs to pee. \nRHODES stops at A CELL marked \"BUB!\". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE, tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins. \nRHODES Well, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss Henried's pride and joy. \nRHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly. \nRHODES Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends, Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my sack here. \nA LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see. \n82\tINT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT \nMARY HENRIED AND JULIE GRANT have entered through A STEEL DOOR WITH ELECTRONIC LOCKS. THE ZOMBIES send up A CHORUS OF MOANS AND GROWLS. The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass. Suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into A CELL marked \"SAMSON!\". \nSAMSON is nibbling on ANOTHER HEAD. Much of the flesh is already gone, but we can still recognise...CHICO. The zombie turns the thing up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out grey matter. \nJULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises in MARY'S stomach as well and she reels away from the hideous sight. \nRHODES Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse. \nMARY God....damn you, Rhodes! \nRHODES God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours? \nMARY You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat! \nRHODES No wonder they're so....hungry. \nSuddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth. \nTHE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside, pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle. \nRHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY, ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR. \nMARY stares in shock. JULIE runs towards the exit, trying to scream but gagging on her own acids. She's hysterical. \nRHODES calmly draws his PISTOL, cocks, and FIRES. THE SQUIRMING HEAD IS SHATTERED by the powerful bullet. \n83\tINT. MARY'S OFFICE IN THE CAVE - NIGHT \nA 9 BY 12 CUBICLE with A SMALL COMPUTER TERMINAL, A DESK AND THREE CHAIRS. There's A LIGHTBOX on the wall displaying GROUPS OF CRANIAL X-RAYS. \nMARY guides JULIE GRANT into a chair. RHODES stands cockily in the open doorway. \nJULIE I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived! \nRHODES Any dead whose brains are intact will revive. \nJULIE But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them! \nRHODES They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this. \nJULIE I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to... \nRHODES The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there. \nMARY You gave them a fresh taste of blood! \nRHODES They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it! \nJULIE has calmed herself down. Now she feels angry, betrayed. She looks at MARY accusingly. \nHe turns and walks away. MARY stands still for a time, THE SOUND OF RHODES' CLICKING BOOTHEELS surrounding her, swallowing her. In the DEEP BACKGROUND we can HEAR THE MOANS OF THE CAGED DEAD. \n86\tINT. THE CENTRAL CHAMBERS OF THE CAVE - NIGHT \nMONTAGE: as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS CARVED OUT OF NATURAL ROCK. We are stunned at the enormity of the place. JEEPS AND TRUCKS RUMBLE back and forth. Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF CRATES, CARTONS, WATER AND GAS CANISTERS. FORK LIFTS shift loads from here to there. \nMARY comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made walls. She enters past TWO SECURITY GUARDS, showing her I.D. \n87\tINT. THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT \nMARY moves down A CORRIDOR with NUMBERED DOORS on both sides. We HEAR THE SOUND OF LIFE, MUSIC BLASTING, VOICES LAUGHING, ARGUING, CRYING. PEOPLE move by. A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting. She slaps him, he punches her, she kicks him in the balls. THREE HOOKERS pound on a door. The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on his nose. OTHER MEN, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke- filled room. \nMARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED 83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES' SOLDIERS with RIFLES in hand. The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside. \nMARY turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through the hallway. As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER. \nMARY Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on. \nTOBY Hey. Slow down. What is it? \nMARY Some of Rhodes' men. At the door. \nTOBY That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast. \nMARY It's because of me. \nTOBY Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick. \nMARY I want you to leave. Then maybe... \nTOBY We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor. \nMARY I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need... \nTOBY Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ! \nMARY I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland. \nTOBY For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says. \nMARY looks into TOBY'S eyes. She's hurt, yet angry. The kind of anger that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive guilt-nerve. \nTOBY We're gettin' out. Me and Tricks. I want you to come with us. I want that more than anything. I'll send word. I'll let you know a time and a place to meet. We probably won't be able to wait around so if you're not there on the dot...well...if you're not there, I'll know you're not comin'. \nShe grabs him, holding him tightly against her. They kiss, hard and long. TOBY pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts toward the guarded apartment. MARY follows. \nTOBY (walking) I don't know what they're gonna do to me. I figure they'll just send me out to Stalag Seventeen but if...if it's worse than that...Tricks will know. Stay in touch with Tricks. \nAs they approach the door to number 83, THE SOLDIERS there raise their RIFLE to ready positions. \nSOLDIER You Tyler? \nTOBY Yes. \nSOLDIER You're under arrest. I'll take your weapon. \nTOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment. \nMARY What's he supposed to have done? What are the charges? \nSOLDIER Dunno, ma'm. We're on orders. \nMARY Look...I'm Mary Henried. I'm with the special conditioning center. I'm not without influence... \nJOHN It's a tunnel. It's a couple hundred yards. Just keep goin' 'til you reach the end. I'll be right behind you. \nSARAH starts down into the hole. JOHN and the others prepare to follow. JUNGLE SOUNDS cover the noises they make. \n92\tINT. THE HOSPITAL IN STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT \nWe see ROWS OF HOME-MADE COTS, each with A BODY lying on top. What faces we see are gaunt, showing the boils and lesions of consumptive diseases and tropical fever. INSECTS BUZZ and there is THUNDER in the air. \nAn Oriental orderly, LUKEY, moves through the maze of bodies. He lifts the wrist of A WOMAN WHO LOOKS DEAD and he discovers that she is dead indeed. He hurries off. \n93\tINT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT \nThis is a room with walls, an operating room with JURY-RIGGED APPOINTMENTS. On A TABLE, under A HALF-DOZEN LIGHT BULBS, lies A CORPSE. Another orderly, a Nordic type names DIESEL, an enormous man, assists while DOCTOR LOGAN methodically SAWS OFF THE CORPSE'S HEAD. \nLUKEY rushes in out of breath. \nLUKEY Doc Logan! Doc Logan! Dere's a lady dead out dere! Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry! Dunno how long she been dat way! Maybe she gettin' ready to come back. \nTHE CORPSE'S HEAD ROLLS AWAY FROM ITS BODY. DOC LOGAN picks up AN ELECTRIC DRILL WITH A LONG BIT. WHZZZZZZZZZ! HE DRIVES THE SPINNING BIT INTO THE DISEMBODIED HEAD, DEEP INTO ITS BRAIN. When he pulls it out, MATTER FLIES as the motor winds down. \nLOGAN is a middle aged man. He looks exhausted, demoralised, a bit mad. And he looks as ill as some of his patients. There are OPEN SORES on his face and he hasn't shaved for days. He's covered with two week worth of BLOOD STAINS. He starts around the table leaving DIESEL to dispose of the \"DE-CAP\". \nLOGAN Bury the head. Call the guard for the rest. Get it off the table for now. We'll bring this new one in. \nDIESEL doesn't respond right away. He's heard something. \nLOGAN What is it? \nDIESEL The tunnel. \nLOGAN hears it now, A SCRATCHING, SCUFFLING SOUND. He looks at his watch. \nLOGAN God. It's almost sun-up. \nLOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened. \nLOGAN Who are you? Who are you? \nHe stands up too quickly. Dizziness makes him reel. He smashes into AN INSTRUMENT CART, comes up with A LONG-BLADED SCALPEL and holds the thing threateningly aimed at the stranger. \nJOHN It's OK. It's OK, Doc. She's with us. \nIn the next moment, SARAH and the others climb out of the tunnel. \nJOHN This here's the hospital. That's Diesel over there, the big guy. This here's Lukey and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut your tonsils out. \nSPIDER, the last one to climb into the room, quickly begins collecting WEAPONS, what few the rebels have. \nJOHN This here's all the weapons we got. That's why your fancy automatic looks so good to us. We gotta stick it over here with the others for now. They catch us with any kind o' weapon and its death without even askin' your name. \nSARAH lets SPIDER take her GUN. The deaf mute signs something which SARAH can't decipher. \nJOHN Ammunition. You got ammunition in your pack there? I hope you do or the gun ain't worth much. \nSARAH roots through her SUPPLY PACK and produces THREE LOADED CLIPS AND SEVERAL BOXES OF LOOSE SHELLS. JOHN notices SOME TINS OF FOOD, MEDICINES, A KNIFE, A COMPASS... \nJOHN We better just hide the whole pack, darlin'. That stuff is just shoutin' out that it come from the mainland. The shit we get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and crackers from 1958. \nSPIDER snatches THE PACK away rather roughly. SARAH is a little disturbed by the action. THE MATERIAL is stashed under FLOOR BOARDS beside the tunnel entrance. \nJOHN Let's go. You look like you could use some shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted tomorrow. \nLUKEY escorts JOHN AND SARAH out of the operating room into the main hospital area. BILL McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask. \nGASPARILLA Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya? \nRHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor. He smiles at MARY pointedly as he starts his speech. \nRHODES Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to... \nMARY (standing) Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is... \nGASPARILLA (with a mouthful of mango) Miss Henried, I think you better... \nMARY ...Captain Rhodes is trying to... \nGASPARILLA (spitting a wad of chewed pulp into his hand) MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!! \nMARY'S eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up. GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his fingers on his military jacket. \nRHODES I don't want to take up a lot of time with this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against orders. There are eyewitnesses. I've reprimanded Tyler and I've had him sent outside. It's as simple as that. \nGASPARILLA Ya had 'im sent ta the Stalag? That's all ya did to 'im? \nRHODES The prisoner was dying, sir. Tyler acted out of a sense of mercy. I don't believe Tyler to be dangerous, General. He just needs...discipline. Two or three months outside will teach him...discipline. \nMARY Sir. It's quite clear that... \nGASPARILLA SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE! \nMARY THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS... \nGASPARILLA SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP! \nMARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only hope that's all she's going to lose. \nGASPARILLA Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about. \nMARY (softly, carefully) I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by... \nGASPARILLA Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's \nGASPARILLA gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight. \nMARY Tonight? \nGASPARILLA That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy. \nMARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES. THE CAPTAIN responds with a phoney look of sympathy. \n101\tINT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT \nThe place is full of EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, TREADMILLS, WEIGHTS, A NAUTILUS, ETC. There are other items which seem contradictory, PLUSH PILLOWS, A HUGE CIRCULAR BED SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS. Delicacies of FOOD AND DRINK lie about on LOW TABLES. The room is a cross between Elaine Powers and a harem chamber. \nA HUGE COFFIN-SHAPED DEVICE opens and we see that the inside is lined with ULTRAVIOLET TUBES which are covered with plexiglass. GASPARILLA lounges inside the thing, sweating, having just taken a long dose of fake sunshine. \nAll around are THE COUNCILMEN, some with COUNTRY-CLUB TYPE WOMEN, conservatively dressed and wearing suitable jewellery (obviously wives left over from the good old days), and some with SCANTILY CLAD COURTESANS. \nOTHER SCANTILY CLAD \"BUNNY\" TYPES are serving HORS-D'OEUVRES and pouring WINE, offering SMOKE AND SNORT. \nMARY HENRIED is sitting on the floor, lost in fluffy pillows, her LAB COAT incongruous. RHODES watches her from nearby. \nGASPARILLA AWRITE. C'MON LADIES. OFF WITH IT... AND ON WITH IT...HA HA HA... \nMUSIC BLARES and SEVERAL OF THE COURTESANS spring up, stripping off what few clothes they are wearing. Some strip naked, others down to panties. They hop onto various exercise machines and begin to \"workout\", tits flopping, thighs pumping...GASPARILLA'S kind of entertainment. \nGASPARILLA Oh, Lordy, Lordy...I'm drunk as a skunk. Look at this...will ya jus' loooooook at these lovelies! Say, Henried, you ever try it with another woman? \nSARAH Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in... \nJOHN He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies. \nBehind JOHN on the street TOBY TYLER is looking on. He has heard the conversation. JOHN turns and sees him. His eyes go dark with apprehension. \nTOBY It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk? \nJOHN Ain't no place safe. \nTOBY Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island. \nPEOPLE are pushing in closer attracted by the commotion inside the Ritz. TOBY has to make it fast. He whispers. \nTOBY I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital... \nJOHN The hospital? (surprised, worried) \nTOBY Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk. \nJOHN Maybe. \nTOBY drifts off into the crowd. JOHN AND SARAH exchange glances. \n105\tEXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING \nSUPPLIES are being brought in through THE MAIN GATES, CRATES, CARTONS, BAGS OF GRAIN, SEED, FERTILISER. \nTRICKS is in charge of the patrol from the Cave. He's checking items as they're picked up by WORKERS from the compound. TOBY TYLER sidles up to his friend. \nTOBY Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on. \nTRICKS Not as bad as yours, pal. \nTOBY (whispering) What'dya get? \nTRICKS Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo. \nTOBY We need fuel, and a couple automatics. \nLUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES MARKED WITH RED CROSSES. \nTRICKS Hey, you. Those two on the bottom. Don't open those yet. They might be from the wrong shipment. Just keep 'em around 'til I can check. \nLUKEY Yessir. I never open 'em. Nossir. I keep 'em innaback for you. \n106\tEXT. FRONT STREET OF STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING \nWatching from the shadows of A BUILDING are JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL. \nDIESEL He's a spy. A spy for Rhodes. \nJOHN Give him a chance. \nThey see TOBY pull away from TRICKS and start down the street following LUKEY. They move out and catch up with TOBY, flanking him. \nJOHN What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels? \nTOBY He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital? \nSHORT CUT TO: \n107\tINT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - MORNING \nTOBY What about the people here in the camp? If they don't get blown to kingdom come their food'll be destroyed, their water, medical supplies. They won't have any more power. This island can't support them all, they'll be doomed. Count me out, friends. I'm gonna get my ass outa here. Anybody wants to come along is welcome. \nSilence falls over the room. Finally JOHN moves towards the door. TOBY follows but before exiting he turns back to face the group once more. \nTOBY I wanna see Rhodes burn just a much as you do...but all those people. We don't have the right to be their judges... just like they don't have the right to be our judges. \nJOHN opens the door and TOBY exits. SARAH follows. JOHN looks around at the faces in the group, then he leaves, shutting the door behind him. There's a long silence, then LOGAN speaks. \nLOGAN We know what we must do. It's written for us in the Bible. \"They shall be driven from the land of the living down to the world of the dead. That is the fate of those who care nothing for God.\" \n109\tINT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - DAY \nLUKEY stands guard. McDERMOTT has joined SARAH AND JOHN in a strategy huddle. TOBY stands nearby, feeling strangely guilty. \nSARAH Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys. \nJOHN Datura. \nSARAH What? \nJOHN Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system. \nSARAH Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel! \nJOHN We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough. \nSARAH There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat. \nTOBY This stuff really works? No shit? \nJOHN Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep. \nTOBY If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you. \nJOHN I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha... \n110\tEXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT \nTHE FISHING BOAT that bought SARAH and her friends to the island sits still in the channel. There are SOLDIERS ABOARD, two of Rhodes' men, pacing the deck, passing a bottle back and forth. \nJOHN (o.s.) Well, we found yer boat, lady, but so did they. \nJOHN, SARAH AND TOBY are huddled behind green cover peering out at the boat. \nSARAH Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes. \nJOHN We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five. \nTOBY That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages. \nJOHN Come on. Let's go. \nThey move off stealthily. \nThey enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel discovered. Six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with their bells down, these are Daturas, nightshades indigenous to southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean. \nSALLY AND JACK, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS. They're wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses. JOHN moves in to help. TOBY AND SARAH follow but JOHN stops them. \nJOHN Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a while. Can't breathe this grass too long or somebody hafta carry you home. \nWork goes on in silence. \n111\tEXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE RITZ - NIGHT \nDIESEL frees the doctor's shoulder from the hook. BLOOD FLOWS FREELY. DIESEL grabs a handful of DRESSINGS from LOGAN'S PACK and goes to work on the wound. \nLOGAN ...the pain of Hell...the pain...the pain... \n115\tEXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE VENTS - NIGHT \nSARAH, SALLY, LUKEY AND McDERMOTT stand by while JOHN AND TOBY swing open THE RUSTED GRILLWORK OF AN AIR-VENT in the ground. TOBY is able to swing his upper torso completely down inside. \n116\tINT. THE VENT - NIGHT \nTOBY hangs up-side-down in A RUSH OF AIR. He tightens A HOSPITAL MASK over his nose and mouth. \nTOBY Okay. Lemme have 'em. \nA LEAF BAG is passed in from above. TOBY flags the bag open and BITS OF FLOWER AND POLLEN DUST FLY through the tight space, sucked off into the duct. \n117\tINT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: A GRILL NEAR THE CEILING. BITS OF TOXIC POLLEN and AN OCCASIONAL PIECE OF FLOWER blow into the room. \nThere are SIX TECHNICIANS AND TWO SECURITY GUARDS posted at various stations. A RADIO MAN looks up. \nRADIO MAN What's that? Smell it? \nTECHNICIAN Dunno. Must be comin' from outside. Kinda nice. \n118\tINT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SEVEN - NIGHT \nThere are only TWO GUARDS posted at the sealed entrance. One is eating from A CAN OF SPAM. The other is reading an old, dog-eared PLAYBOY. A RIFLE BARREL jabs suddenly into \"Playboy's\" back. \nJULIE Don't move! \nIt's JULIE GRANT, Mary's disgruntled assistant. A YOUNG MAN, another behaviouralist in a WHITE LAB COAT is with her. They both have RIFLES. \nJULIE Open the outer door. Move it! \n\"Playboy\" slowly gets up and starts towards A CONTROL PANEL. At the last minute, he spins around, grabbing JULIE'S GUN BARREL and pushing it away. JULIE'S YOUNG ACCOMPLICE swings his RIFLE BUTT and knocks \"Playboy\" cold. Then he trains the weapon on \"Spam man\" again. \nJULIE moves to the controls, examines them, trips A TOGGLE marked \"LOCK\" and pushes A LARGE GREEN BUTTON. \nTHE DOOR TO THE OUTSIDE SWINGS OPEN. Beyond is blackness with an occasional patch of MOONLIGHT ON JUNGLE GROWTH. JULIE walks slowly, carefully toward the opening. Just as she is about to cross the threshold into the night, A HUGE FIGURE leaps at her, grabbing her RIFLE and enclosing her in a strangle hold. It's DIESEL. Behind him, comes JACK, his RIFLE (Sarah's rifle) levelled off at JULIE'S YOUNG FRIEND. \n\"Spam man\" makes a break for it down the hall. Reacting nervously, too quickly, JACK FIRES. \"SPAM MAN\" IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE BACK. He pitches forward, dead. \nTHE YOUNG SCIENTIST raises his gun. \nYOUNG MAN Hey! What the hell.....? \nJACK FIRES ANOTHER BURST and the ORANGE CIRCLE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S CHEST SHOW A DOTTED LINE OF RED. He flies back, a surprised expression on his face, and he flops, dead, right on top of the \"Playboy\" guard who is lying near the control booth. \nLOGAN ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! \nTHE DOC comes slowly out of the night guiding SPIDER over the threshold and into the hall. LOGAN reminds us of a crazy John Houston, floating on air in a madman's bubble. \nJULIE What...what is this? Who...? \nLOGAN It's alright, it's alright, my dear. You've simply helped us do the Lord's work. \nLOGAN'S SHOULDER WOUND IS BLEEDING THROUGH ITS DRESSINGS but the doctor, on a holy mission, seems to feel no pain. He guides SPIDER into the light and opens her shirt. DIESEL shoves JULIE against a wall. JACK covers her with his AUTOMATIC. \nLOGAN removes RED-SOAKED DRESSING from SPIDER'S skin. All over her bare chest and upper belly we see LONG, EIGHT-INCH SCARS, HASTILY STITCHED WITH SUTURE SHOWING. Beneath each is A CIGAR-SHAPED BULGE where a vial of nitro has been implanted. The woman stands on crumbling legs, her arms open outward, a grotesque lampoon of a stigmatic. \nJULIE What...what have you done to her? \nTOBY (filter) (on video) LET US IN. THERE'S BEEN A REVOLT...AT STALAG SEVENTEEN...THERE'S REBELS CRAWLIN' EVERYWHERE! \nGUARD #2 I know him. That's Tyler. \nTOBY (filter) (on video) FER CHRISSAKE! LEMME IN, DAMMIT! LEMME IN! \nTHE FIRST GUARD HITS A BUTTON AND THE BIG STEEL ENTRANCE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. THE REBELS storm in like an ocean wave taking the hapless GUARDS completely by surprise. They knock them unconscious and take their WEAPONS. TOBY pushes A BUTTON which causes the outer door to swing shut, then he leads the band down the corridor. \nThey go through A DOOR about a hundred yards from the entrance. \n123\tINT. MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT \nThis is one of the WORK CORRIDORS that TOBY mentioned earlier. THE REBELS run, single-file, deep into the Cave. \n124\tINT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT \nJULIE GRANT has been ROPE-TIED to an eyelet in the wall. DIESEL sets down A PISTOL AND A BOX OF AMMO beside DOC LOGAN who is sitting on the floor beside the control booth. He's having trouble catching his breath. His WOUND has turned his ENTIRE FRONT RED. \nDIESEL You'd hold us back. We have to go on. \nLOGAN Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on. \nSPIDER, her shirt buttoned again over her new dressings, is carefully signing something. DIESEL reads her fingers. \nDIESEL Maps. Yes. She was supposed to bring us maps. \nJACK steps over to JULIE. He frisks her pockets and finds TWO HAND- DRAWN MAPS showing complete layouts of the Cave. \nDIESEL Alright. Let's go. \nThey move out, DIESEL supporting SPIDER, JACK with his RIFLE ready. \n125\tINT. A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT \nTOBY breaks open A CARTON and pulls GAS MASKS out. He passes them back to BILL McDERMOTT AND SARAH. \n126\tINT. THE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT \nTHE REBELS, all wearing GAS MASKS, burst into the room. TOBY moves right toward AN INTERCOM. He punches in a code and waits while the INTERCOM BUZZES. \nTOBY Come on, Mary. Answer. ANSWER! \nNothing. Toby punches up another code while the others drag THE UNCONSCIOUS GUARD out of the doorway, letting the doors shut behind them. A VOICE comes over the speakers. \nTRICKS (o.s. - filter) Yeah. \nTOBY Tricks, it's Tyler. We're inside. \nTRICKS (o.s. - filter) What? Was that you that set off the alarms? \nTOBY No. There's some loonies from outside. They're gonna try to blow the powder magazine. \nTRICKS (o.s. - filter) Where are you? What's the plan? \nTOBY Find Mary. If you can get help do it. We're gonna hit the power station and haul-ass outa here. We'll be at exit five...that's exit five in exactly ten minutes. \nTRICKS (o.s. - filter) I think I can get a couple guys. \nTOBY And Mary! You gotta find Mary! \nTRICKS (o.s. - filter) I'll try, Tob. I'm gone. \nTRICKS clicks off. TOBY levels his AUTOMATIC at the RADIO CONSOLE and FIRES. SPARKS FLY, CHUNKS OF WOOD AND METAL SHOOT OFF IN EVERY DIRECTION. \nNURSE What should we do? \nMARY looks past THE NURSE into A ROOM where A GROUP OF CHILDREN, a dozen or so, ranging from twelve-years-old down to infancy, are huddled. Some are crying. \nMARY God. I, er...I dunno what to say. It could be a real evacuation or it could just be a glitch in the system. Wait here for now. I'll...I'll make sure you get the word what to do, okay? \nNURSE Please...hurry... \nMARY takes off down the hall. \n135\tINT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: JULIE GRANT'S FACE, screaming, in agony, on the brink of insanity. THE ZOMBIES have reached her. They're started to pull at her arms, her legs. ONE BITES HER HAND, ANOTHER HER ARM, ANOTHER HER CALF. \nDOC LOGAN is watching from the control booth, all the while fiddling with BUTTONS, DIALS, LEVERS. \nLOGAN We'll be in Heaven soon. We'll all be in Heaven soon. (Julie's screams penetrate the fog in his brain. He frowns.) Pain. God forgive the pain inflicted by surgeons. We must atone. We must atone for our sins. \nHis eye is attracted to A LARGE LEVER seemingly separate from everything else. It's marked: SIREN. He pulls it. \nLOGAN We must...atone. We must. \n136\tEXT. THE SIREN HORN - NIGHT \nSlowly, THE THROATY WAIL RISES and calls out over the jungle. It's the \"Feeding Signal\" we heard earlier. \n137\tEXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT \nMONTAGE: as everywhere in the jungle ZOMBIES turn toward the call of THE SIREN. They start to walk...toward the SOUND, toward the place where there is food. \n138\tINT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT \nJULIE is still screaming wildly. THE ZOMBIES ARE TEARING HER APART, LITERALLY. \nDOC LOGAN inadvertently kicks THE PISTOL left by DIESEL and is skitters across the floor. He flops down on his knees. \nLOGAN WE WILL ATONE. WE WILL BE THE SACRIFICE...THE COMMUNION...WE OFFER OURSELVES UP...OUR SOUL...AND OUR BODIES... \nJULIE GRANT finally loses consciousness. MANY MORE ZOMBIES are pressing in through the entrance now. They reach LOGAN and start to tear at him. Something clicks in his brain and he realises what's happening. He starts to scream. His hands find THE PISTOL on the floor. \nONE ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF HIS LEFT ARM. He shrieks and brings up THE PISTOL, FIRING. THE FIRST SHOT RIPS OPEN THE CREATURE'S SKULL. The next FIVE SHOTS are wasted, FIRED WILDLY. The GUN CLICKS emptily as THE ZOMBIES engulf him, TEARING, BITING, EATING HIM ALIVE. \nMORE ZOMBIES come out of the jungle...a lot more...called by the SIREN. In waves they enter the Cave looking for food. \n139\tINT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT \nTRICKS is running through the hall with TWO BUDDIES. MARY HENRIED jumps out of the crowd. \nMARY Tricks! What's going on? \nTRICKS Toby's in the Cave. We're gonna make our move. There's rebels out to blow the powder magazine. Come on. Come with us. \nMARY Where are you goin' out? \nTRICKS Exit five. \nMARY See ya there. \nShe turns away and starts back in the direction she came from. TRICKS calls after her. \nTRICKS SEVEN MINUTES, MARY. EXACTLY SEVEN MINUTES! \n140\tINT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT \nRHODES HENRIED! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? \nWithout answering, MARY leads her band through A MANUAL DOOR that leads to the Dormitory. \nRHODES STOP THEM! SHOOT! \nSOLDIER The...the children, sir. \nRHODES After them then! I want them stopped! That woman is dangerous! \n148\tINT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY - NIGHT \nMARY AND HER REFUGEES are stopped in their tracks by BUB AND HIS CADRE OF RED COATS. THE NURSE screams and tries to back away. THE CHILDREN cling to her, petrified, shrieking, starting to cry. \nBUB lumbers up to MARY and...salutes. MARY returns the formality. \nMARY It's alright. I don't think they'll hurt us. Try to stay calm. \n149\tINT. THE OUTER CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nTHE MANUAL DOOR has been locked from inside. \nRHODES SHOOT IT OPEN! \nTHE SOLDIERS follow orders, TWO OF THEM FIRING AT THE LOCK. \n150\tINT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT \nMARY is at A CABINET pulling out PISTOLS AND RIFLES, passing the weapons around to TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON. BUB is strapping on his TWO- GUN HOLSTER SET all by himself, fumbling a little, but succeeding. \n151\tINT. THE CORRIDOR WITH RHODES - NIGHT \nRHODES' MEN kick open the door and charge into the Dormitory corridor. \n152\tINT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT \nTHE NURSE slams ANOTHER MANUAL DOOR, locking and bolting it. \nNURSE They're coming! They're coming! \nShe hurries along the caged alley behind the firing stalls guiding THE CHILDREN to an opposite exit. \nBLAM! BLAM! MARY IS FIRING at AN ORANGE CIRCLE VEST on one of the cut out target figures in the range. THE RED COATS are watching with curiosity, cocking their heads. \nMARY moves to fire again but BLUTO grabs her hand. \nMARY NO...BLUTO...I'M TRYING TO... \nThe dumb creature keeps his grip. MARY has to appease to him. She grasps his hand and shakes vigorously. When he finally lets go, she aims her PISTOL again and FIRES AT THE VEST SEVERAL MORE TIMES. \nMARY Look. It's good to shoot the circles. Good. Good. \nTHE ZOMBIES are confused. Exasperated, MARY tears off her own vest and tosses it down the alley. THE RED COATS look befuddled, and a little angry. MARY FIRES at the vest she threw down. TWO BULLETS HIT IT before MARY'S PISTOL CLICKS...empty. \nThere's A POUNDING AT THE DOOR. It's RHODES AND HIS TROOP. \nSuddenly BUB steps into position. WHAP! One of his famous quick draws! BLAM!!! HE FIRES. THE VEST ON THE FLOOR, MARY'S VEST, IS HIT. BUB FIRES AGAIN, the other gun this time. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS HIT squarely in the center of its orange circle. \nTONTO now turns. He lifts his PISTOL and FIRES. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS HIT AGAIN, off center, but hit. \nMARY THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! \nSuddenly THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE RANGE FLIES OPEN. THREE OF RHODES' MEN RUSH IN, wearing, of course, orange circles. THE RED COATS OPEN FIRE. THE TROOPERS ARE CUT TO RIBBONS. Others outside the door duck back behind the walls. \nSARAH Five days...and he hasn't...risen. He hasn't risen. \nTOBY Come on. There's no time. There's no time to lose. \nTHE GROUP pushes ahead. SARAH kneels. She blesses herself and makes the sign of the cross over the corpse. Then she stands to see that JOHN is waiting for her. He holds out his hand, she takes it and follows the others. \n159\tEXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT \nTHE SOLDIERS aboard THE FISHING BOAT hear NOISES coming from the surrounding jungle. \nSOLDIER WHO IS IT? WHO'S OUT THERE? \nJOHN (o.s.) WE WANT THE BOAT! DROP YER GUNS OR WE'LL BLAST YOU! \nTHE SOLDIERS hesitate, looking around at the dark jungle. \nTOBY (o.s.) WE GOT YOU SURROUNDED! \nA SUDDEN BURST OF AUTOMATIC FIRE LIGHTS UP THE BLACK FOLIAGE. THE SOLDIERS react, flinging their WEAPONS over the side into the water. \nTHE REFUGEES spill out of the undergrowth and scramble over to the boat, lifting THE CHILDREN and THE WOUNDED TRICKS on board carefully. \nJOHN pauses to look back into the jungle. \nJOHN Damn you, island. Damn you ta Hell and worse! \nMcDERMOTT We ain't outa here yet. Get yer ass movin' ya dumb bastard. \nMcDERMOTT tries to slug from his flask, finds it empty. With a shrug he tosses the thing into the backwater. THE ENGINE STARTS as JOHN climbs aboard, SARAH AND TOBY giving him their hands. \n160\tINT. THE MAIN CHAMBER WITH DIESEL AND SPIDER - NIGHT \n161\tINT. THE LABORATORY AREA WITH RHODES AND BUB - NIGHT \n(These two sequences will be intercut for parallel action) \nZOMBIES are crawling all over DIESEL now. He fights them off valiantly but his super strength is waning. HE IS BITTEN AGAIN AND AGAIN but he tries to keep himself between THE CLUTCHING CREATURES AND THE LITTLE DEAF MUTE who is stumbling along ahead. She's getting very close to a huge SET OF CONCRETE SLABS...THE DOORS TO THE POWDER MAGAZINE. \nMeanwhile RHODES approaches another corner in the hallway near the Conditioning Room. BUB follows, his boot heels CLICKING the way RHODES' own heels once clicked. \nRHODES dives for the corner. BUB slaps leather and FIRES OFF ALL TWELVE. RHODES rolls on the ground crazily. HE'S HIT SEVERAL TIMES...but he's still alive. He pulls himself, in agony, out of range. Calmly, BUB dumps out his spent shells and starts to reload. \nIN THE MAIN CHAMBER, DIESEL IS OVERCOME, DRAGGED DOWN BY A MOB OF ZOMBIES. THEY START TO TEAR HIM APART BIT BY BIT. \nSPIDER walks on alone. She is just a few feet from the POWDER MAGAZINE now. A ZOMBIE grabs her from behind but just gets a handful of shirt. SPIDER reaches forward but the creature holds her back. Her SHIRT IS RUNNING RIVERS OF BLOOD NOW where the vials are implanted underneath. \nRHODES crashes through a doorway into THE CONDITIONING ROOM. He realises, too late, that there's no exit. BUB'S BOOTHEELS are getting LOUDER. RHODES crawls around behind THE TABLES FULL OF TESTING EQUIPMENT, WOODEN SHAPES, FLASH CARDS SCATTER. Over near the LARGE COLOURED SYMBOLS which are mounted on the wall there's A WEAPONS CABINET. RHODES grabs a chair and smashes open the glass. \nBUB steps into the open doorway, still reloading his PISTOLS. He stands there, a golem, his fingers slowly, calmly working. He drops a shell or two but soon the barrels are filled with fresh loads. \nRHODES reaches in through the broken glass and pulls out AN AUTOMATIC. \nBUB slaps his PISTOLS back into their HOLSTERS and face off. \nRHODES lifts the AUTOMATIC...aims... \nBUB DRAWS! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EACH ONE OF THE TWELVE BULLETS HITS RHODES SOMEWHERE, many of them in the \"kill-zones\". He screams when the first few rounds hit, but his screaming stops about halfway through the barrage. That's when he dies. His leg bones support his corpse long enough for the last six bullets to reach him. Then, as THE SOUND OF BUB'S GUN ECHOES AWAY down the corridors, RHODES BODY slides down the wall and crumples to the floor in a heap, leaving MUCH OF HIS BLOOD on the ORANGE CIRCLE that's mounted behind him. \nIN THE MAIN CHAMBER, A ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF SPIDER'S SHOULDER. IT PULLS OUT A BIG CHUNK OF FLESH, AND WITH IT, STUCK IN THE CREATURE'S TEETH, COMES ONE OF THE NITRO VIALS. \nSEVERAL ZOMBIES are pulling at the woman. She is still reaching for the POWDER MAGAZINE DOORS but the ghouls are pulling her away. \nTHE CREATURE WITH THE TEST TUBE IN ITS MOUTH pulls the bothersome thing out from between its teeth. It studies the vial curiously for a moment, then it tosses it angrily towards SPIDER, toward THE MAGAZINE DOOR... \n", "test1_input": "SARAH Help me get him to the boat. \nCHICO Leave him. \nSARAH calmly raises her .45 and aims it directly at CHICO's head. \nSARAH Help me or die. \nReluctantly the man moves towards MIGUEL and the two survivors drag his limp body over the decking. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n28\tEXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - SUNSET \nThe fishing boat is gone. Orange light from the western horizon paints the scene. FIGURES are moving about on the dock, slumped, lumbering figures....ZOMBIES. \nThey're clustering around THE TRAWLER, around THE CORPSES OF THE ATTACKERS. \nTHEY BEGIN PULLING THOSE CORPSES APART AND EATING THEM HUNGRILY. \nONE CREATURE has found MIGUEL'S SEVERED FOREARM. IT PULLS A BIG CHUNK OFF THE THING WITH ITS TEETH. It chews for a time, ITS DROOL TURNING RED. Then it spits out MIGUEL'S WRISTWATCH as though it was a bothersome bit of bone. \n29\tEXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - SUNSET \nTHE TWO WOMEN hover over their wounded, TONY AND MIGUEL. CHICO steers the boat. Suddenly, TONY arches his back and screams in pain. \nTONY Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee... \nMARIA Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest. \nTONY I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish... \nA coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command. \nMIGUEL He is dying. I will end his pain. \nMIGUEL draws his PISTOL. \nMARIA NOOOOOOOOO! \nTONY ...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love... \nMIGUEL He is dying. He knows it. \nMARIA You are dying, too. \nMIGUEL No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live. \nTONY I firmly resolve...with the... with the help...the help of...of Thy grace... \nTONY collapses. A long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH. \nMARIA Tony...TONY! \nThe woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine. Then the woman, sensing something, turns back towards MIGUEL. His pistol is raised, aimed at TONY'S head. \nMARIA NO! YOU CAN'T! \nSARAH It must be done. You know this. It must by done to keep him from... \nMARIA It won't happen to him! It won't happen to him! You heard his prayer. His prayer will save him. He could never become one of...one of those... devils. \nMIGUEL Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours. \n", "test1_true": "MIGUEL One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe. \nMARIA You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done. \nMIGUEL No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die. \nThat madman's glaze is wet in MIGUEL'S eyes again. A grin curls his mouth into an odd shape. He freezes, staring, waiting. SARAH shows concern. \n30\tEXT. DEEP WATER (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - NIGHT \nA CRESCENT MOON lies on its back. Below, on the pitch black water, its reflection, a vertical stripe, breaks open as THE BOAT passes through it...CHUG-CHUG-CHUG. \n31\tEXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - NIGHT \nCHICO has fallen asleep at the tiller. SARAH is asleep as well, and so is MARIA. \nA SILENT SHADOW moves over the side rail. HANDS reach out and grip MARIA'S shoulders, lifting her up, up from sleep. Her eyes flutter open. \nTONY'S face is blue-grey in the moonlight. It takes the woman a second or two to recognise that HE IS ONE OF THE LIVING DEAD. His hungry mouth lunges towards her neck. His DROOLING TEETH SINK DEEP. The woman screams. \nSARAH wakes with a start. MIGUEL is already awake. He's been watching all along. Now he watches still, his PISTOL idle in his one good hand, his mouth curled in that strange grin, as MARIA'S screams shatter the quiet night. \nAt the tiller, CHICO sees what's happening. He fumbles for the AUTOMATIC RIFLE that's strapped over his shoulder. \nA PORK-CHOP-SIZE CHUNK COMES OUT OF MARIA'S NECK IN THE CLENCHED TEETH OF THE TONY-CREATURE. BLOOD SQUIRTS UPWARD IN A FIVE-FOOT ARC. \nSARAH lifts her RIFLE from her lap. She is the first to FIRE. An instant later, CHICO FIRES as well. \nTHE HEAD ON THE TONY-CREATURE IS HIT BY RAPID-FIRE LOADS from each gun and IT COME APART ABOVE THE EYES. Its body staggers stiffly into MARIA. She tries to stand, tries to pull away, screams still bubbling in her torn throat. She topples backward over the side rail. The corpse, taller and heavier, flips rigidly over, its feet kicking skyward, and splashes in to the deep, black Gulf. \nMARIA, the small of her back balanced precariously on the side rail, grabs at the air trying to swing her weight back on board. SARAH springs forward. She reaches the other woman a second too late. Their hands brush but don't catch. MARIA slips over the side. A LOUD SPLASH CUTS OFF HER SCREAMS. \nCHICO brings the boat about in as tight a circle as possible. He and SARAH stare out over the water. The blackness out there is absolute. Visibility zero. \nSilence....but for the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the boat's engine. \nMIGUEL slowly raises his hand and aims his PISTOL at a LARGE, TURTLE- SHAPED SPLOTCH OF BLOOD on the hull across the cabin, the spot where TONY died. With that odd grin still on his lips, HE BEGINS TO FIRE one shot at a time in deliberate, slow rhythm. \nTHE BULLETS PUNCH HOLES through the wooden side-wall, most of them hitting squarely in the blood stain. \nSARAH looks over toward CHICO who returns her look with frightened eyes. \n32\tEXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (EST.) - DAY \nIt looks like a tropical paradise. Greatly separated from the other smaller islands on the horizon, its vegetation is dense and lush. There's no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place, no power lines, no buildings. What meets the eye is all natural and inviting. \nTHE FISHING BOAT chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side of the island. \n33\tEXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN THE BASIN) - DAY \nCHICO It looks uninhabited. What do you think? \nMIGUEL I think we should burn the church. Kill the priest and burn the church. It's the only way. The only way. \nMIGUEL is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold. FLIES ARE BUZZING in a cluster around his WRAPPED STUMP. He's over the edge now, insane. And worse than that, the infection from the original bite is spreading. The amputation was not done quickly enough to prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and elsewhere. \nSARAH turns towards the madman once her lover. Her heart is too callused for emotion to reach it. She just stares, her eyes dead cold like the eyes of a shark. \nCHICO I'm pullin' in. \n34\tEXT. THE ISLAND (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY \n", "test1_id": 1341, "test2_input": "RHODES grins as he watches the spectacle. \nSuddenly, A LOUD GUNSHOT startles the captain. He drops the binoculars and spins around. He sees... \n...CHICO'S BODY DANGLING ON THE ROPE. CHICO'S HEAD IS BLOODY. He's dead...and won't come back to life. He's been shot through the brain. \nRHODES WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? \nSOLDIERS stand around dumbly. Those with RIFLES in their hands quickly sling them onto their shoulders. They're all afraid of the captain's wrath. RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in his eyes. \nRHODES Goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who fired that shot or I'll have every last one of you chopped up for feed!!! \nHis eyes spot TOBY, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his rifle slung. \nRHODES Step up here, Tyler. \nTOBY Sir! \nTOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister. \nRHODES You fired that shot, didn't you? \nTOBY No, sir. \nRHODES Let me see your weapon. \nTOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it. \nRHODES It's been fired. \nTOBY In the battle, sir. \nRHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly. \nRHODES It may be that none of these chicken-shits will talk while the whole troop is present...but I know some of these men well. I'm sure that a few private conversations will tell me what I already know. You may have earned yourself some time in the Stalag, Tyler. (Rhodes glances over at CHICO'S body) Cut him down. That's another head for you to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take the rest of his body down to the freezers. Move it, shit hill. \nTOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns. \nCUT TO: \n73\tINT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING \nThere's that GIANT SOUND again, the RUMBLE OF THE ELEVATOR. We're inside the place called THE CAVE, in a huge under-ground concrete bunker. TECHNICIANS AND ARMED GUARDS bustle around. Enormous hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from the surface. Riding on board, RHODES AND HIS PLATOON prepare to unload their paraphernalia. \n74\tEXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING \nSARAH, sweating, exhausted, BLEEDING FROM CUTS made by jungle branches, wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve. She has dipped it into a jungle stream. Cautiously she tastes the water, decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth. \nThe NIGHT BIRDS suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes SARAH look up. Standing across the stream, only ten feet away, is A PARTICULARLY GROTESQUE ZOMBIE. VULTURES stand on the marshy ground beside the creature's legs, THEIR SHARP BEAKS PICKING BLOODY HOLES IN ITS ANKLES AND FEET. \nSARAH jumps to her feet, fighting back exhaustion one more time. She unslings her RIFLE, aims it, then thinks better of firing. Grabbing up her SUPPLY PACK she runs into the darkening jungle. \n75\tEXT.\tTHE JUNGLE - EVENING \nWHAM! TWO BIG HANDS GRAB SARAH by her shoulders. She starts to scream but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth. \nJOHN It's alright. It's alright. Don't be afraid. We're friends. \nSARAH looks into the strong, good face of JOHN, a tall muscular man, a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes that seem instantly trustworthy. \nJOHN There are soldiers near here. Guards. I'll take my hand away if you won't scream. \nSARAH nods and JOHN lets her go. There are two other humans standing behind the big man. There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease- covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing \"Come on! Let's get outa here!\" with her hands. \n", "test2_true": "THE GROUP starts moving. SARAH follows voluntarily. We notice that all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles. \n76\tEXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING \nTHE GROUP trudges through thick brushland, occasionally needing to chop a path with their blades. JOHN speaks in low tones as they move. \nJOHN Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island. \nSARAH Gasparilla? \nJOHN He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson. \nSARAH Governor Dickerson? Of Florida? \nJOHN That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course. \nSARAH We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns. \nJOHN Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything. \nSPIDER is signing for everyone to be quiet. They all stop in their tracks. BILL McDERMOTT swigs some more brandy. With the stealth of a Mohican SPIDER pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and peers through. \n77\tEXT. ENTRANCE TWO - EVENING \nThere's A HATCHWAY in sight built into A CONCRETE, BUNKER LIKE STRUCTURE. FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS are coming up out of the ground. They're armed with PRODS AND RIFLES. \nBehind the men, lurching on unsteady feet, come A HALF-DOZEN OF THE LIVING DEAD, all wearing vests of white and blue. \nBehind the lumbering creatures come A WOMAN AND A MAN both wearing white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards. The woman is MARY HENRIED, one of the top behaviouralists in The Cave. (We'll learn a lot more about her later.) \nTHE ZOMBIES are pushing through the undergrowth right in the direction of SARAH and her friends. SARAH shows some alarm at this but JOHN calms her with a strong hand. \nSPIDER has seen the approaching danger. She silently draws A FARMER'S SICKLE from her belt. (With her other hand she draws A PISTOL for good measure.) BILL McDERMOTT unarmed, nervously takes another swallow from his flask. \nTHE ZOMBIES are getting closer. Too close for comfort. \nFinally, MARY HENRIED and THE OTHERS turn and disappear into the bunker. The last man down pulls the hatch shut. \nThe moment the coast is clear, SPIDER AND JOHN jump up from cover. THE OTHERS follow their lead. But it's too late. THE ZOMBIES have spotted them. The creatures begin to growl and make AGITATED, APE- LIKE SOUNDS. SPIDER brings her BLADE up chest-high, ready to repel an attack. SARAH lifts her own MACHETE but JOHN reaches over and takes it away from her. \nJOHN Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind me. \n(SARAH resists, not understanding, somewhat insulted.) \nYou ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught not to touch the ones with the circles. There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they leave us alone. The colour on their vests tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's the ones without colours you gotta watch out for. \nSARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his back. \nTHE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket. ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking. \nANOTHER ZOMBIE, a \"white\", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN, growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes two angry steps towards the humans who back away. \nTHE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL. BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground. \nMcDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty. \nMcDERMOTT Sorry. Guess I don't know my own strength. \nJOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman. \nSARAH Thanks. I can fight my own battles. \n", "test2_id": 1342, "test3_input": "It resembles the hospital. There are ROWS AND ROWS OF COTS. SOME PEOPLE SLEEP, alone and in pairs. OTHERS are awake, drinking, screwing, shooting up. SARAH finds an empty cot and flops down. Beyond the open walls she can see THE BLUE-WHITE FLASHES coming from the electrified fence. RAIN LEAKS in on her but it doesn't keep her from falling asleep. \n97\tINT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING \nTECHNICIANS are working with ZOMBIES while ARMED GUARDS stand ready. We FOCUS ON A BLUE COAT. Under supervision, the thing is fumbling to tie a shoelace. It's failing miserably but trying hard. ANOTHER BLUE is busy placing LITTLE WOODEN SHAPES into their proper HOLES IN A BOARD. \nTWO RED COATS sit at a table attended by HUMAN TECHNICIANS. We've seen these zombies before, in the dormitory. TONTO, is...or was...a native American, probably Seminole. In front of him is A PLATE containing SEVERAL BITS OF MEAT. He has A FORK in his hand and he is idly stabbing at the meat. \nThe other RED COAT, BLUTO, looks just like Bluto from Popeye, bulky with a thick, black beard. Tired of THE JIG SAW PUZZLE he's working on, he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on TONTO'S plate. He snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth. As soon as he tastes it, however, he pulls it back out, dribbling and spitting disgustedly. \nFISHER (a technician) They won't accept a substitute. They want their Alpo. \nTONTO has succeeded in forking a piece of meat. He moves it to his mouth and pops it in. \nFISHER Alright! Way ta go, Kemosabe! \nMARY HENRIED has entered the room. She pulls up and watches  TONTO with a kind of dubious interest. TONTO stops chewing. He looks up with exaggerated sadness on his face. Slowly his mouth opens and the chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips. He throws his fork down angrily. \nMARY They won't learn to use forks if they don't like the breakfast you're serving, Ted. \nFISHER The fork is like a game to them. If they get into the game maybe they'll learn to like the food. \nMARY It won't work. \nSuddenly BLUTO jumps up from the table. He flings his chair aside and tromps right over to MARY. His arms are outstretched and he is making a pleading, Karloff-like SOUND. GUARDS come after him but MARY waves them off. \nMARY It's alright! Leave him alone! \nMARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTO'S right and they shake vigorously. Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around. His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next. THE GUARDS lead him away. \n98\tINT. THE FIRING RANGE IN THE CAVE - MORNING \nBLAM!!! A RED COAT is FIRING A PISTOL right AT THE LENS. \nCLOSE ON: A TARGET, a flat, cut out silhouette of a man, BLACK TRIANGLES painted on the instant-kill-zones, brain, heart. BULLETS STRIKE the neck, the to torso, SOME RICOCHET off the wall behind. None hit the kill-zones. \nMARY HENRIED enters. The place resembles a Police Department target range. RED COATS stand in stalls and FIRE down LONG ALLEYS at TARGETS which pop up against the opposite wall. THE NOISE is deafening. TWO TECHNICIANS are watching the shooters and keeping score. MARY walks up to one of them. \nMARY Have you seen Julie Grant this morning? \nTECHNICIAN She should be in the behaviour rooms. \nMARY She's not. Hasn't shown up yet. \nThere's AN OFF-SCREEN GROAN, the sound of a zombie trying to communicate. MARY turns and sees the tall RED COAT names BUB standing in the closest stall trying to attract MARY'S attention. (He was the one Rhodes referred to last night as \"Mary's pride and joy\".) He is wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS, SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both his hips. MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military salute. \nMARY Good morning, Bub. \nBUB replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean something to him. Then he, too, salutes. MARY pulls away, heading for AN EXIT, but BUB calls after her. He makes inarticulate sounds but we catch his drift. \nTECHNICIAN I think he wants you to watch. \nMARY OK, Bub. Do your stuff. \nBUB turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter on a western street. There's A HUMMING MECHANICAL SOUND. KATCHUNG! A SILHOUETTE pops up. BUB slaps leather...fast... lighting fast. BOTH GUN come up. BLAM-KA-BLAM-KA-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!! \nHOLES APPEARS IN THE TARGET...WOP-WOPPETY-WHUMP!!! All in the kill- zones, or damn close. \nBUB slaps ONE PISTOL back into its HOLSTER. He clicks open the shell- chamber on THE OTHER, dumps the SPENT CARTRIDGES and begins to reload from his belt. \nMARY stares at the creature's back, mixed emotions showing on her face. BUB turns to face her. Dropping a bullet, he salutes again. MARY hesitates, then salutes back. \nMARY Very good, Bub. That's....very good. \n", "test3_true": "PEOPLE are changing clothes, going on and off duty. JULIE GRANT rushes in and moves to a locker where she pulls out her LAB COAT. MARY HENRIED enters the room, spots JULIE, and rushes towards her. \nMARY Where the hell have you been? \nJULIE doesn't respond. She buttons her coat never looking up. \nMARY Julie. Are you alright? (still no response) You were missed this morning. I need you. I don't want you getting your ass in hot water. I won't be able to help you if... \nJULIE I don't need any help from you! \nJULIE slams the locker door and storms away toward the exit. \nMARY Julie...JULIE! \nBut she's gone. The locker door has bounced open. MARY slams it and it bounces again. She pounds it with her fist. Suddenly, A LOUD BELL SOUNDS. MARY looks at her watch then exits. \nThere are TWO WOMEN cleaning the locker room with MOPS AND PAILS. One of them turns to watch MARY HENRIED exit. We recognise her. It's SPIDER. \n100\tINT. THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IN THE CAVE - MORNING \nThis is a large Situations Room that is serving now as GOVERNMENT HEADQUARTERS. In A BIG, STUFFED OFFICE CHAIR behind A DESK FLANKED WITH FLAGS sits GOVERNOR HENRY DICKERSON (former of Florida, now of the world) A.K.A.... GASPARILLA. \nAt TABLES sit A DOZEN OR SO COUNCILMEN, Dickerson's cronies from the old Doral Country Club, close friends who were offered asylum in the private underground shelter. Now they sit in council, \"yessing\" everything the boss man says. \nA STATE PROSECUTOR has a DESPERATE-LOOKING PRISONER on the floor, standing with his hands cuffed. \nPROSECUTOR He was found with a government-issue short- wave transmitter in his quarters. He's charged with the theft of that equipment from a government installation and with possession of an illegal radio. \nGASPARILLA munches on SOME FRUIT. He's a fat man with a handlebar moustache that makes him look like Pancho Villa. As an indication of rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a Hawaiian shirt with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern. Around his neck, nestled in the rolls of fat there, is enough gold to stake a small business. \nPROSECUTOR I can only suggest that the court rule in favour of the ultimate penalty for this traitor. \nGASPARILLA You always recommend the ultimate penalty, Tommy Lee. You and Rhodes. \nWe now see that RHODES is present, looking on with a smile. \nGASPARILLA All those...AGAINST...the ultimate penalty raise yer hands. \nNone of THE COUNCILMEN move a muscle. GASPARILLA scans them slowly as he takes a big, wet bite out of a peach. \nGASPARILLA Ya mean ta say nobody's gonna object to the ultimate penalty in this here case? Well, what if I object? What if I object to the ultimate penalty. \nTHE COUNCILMEN look nervous, apprehensive. GASPARILLA'S flexing his power-muscles. \nGASPARILLA There's been a whole lotta swingin' influence and swingin' weight arountyere lately. Does anybody at all give two shits fer what I think any more? Well, I'm a- gonna let this guy off. How d'yall like that? And I want the word ta git out I let 'im off. I let 'im off. Not this council. Maybe I can improve my image rountyere. \nTHE PRISONER looks up at GASPARILLA, hatred boiling inside him. GASPARILLA meets his gaze with a power-mad sneer. \nGASPARILLA Yer sentenced ta hard labour. Stalag Seventeen. A year. \nPRISONER WHY DON'T YOU KILL ME! I PREFER TO DIE! I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH... WITH THIS KIND OF...SIN! \nGASPARILLA WELL, PISS ON YOU, MISTER! I JUST SAVED YOUR ASS! YOU DAMN WELL BETTER NOT GO HOLLERIN' LIKE THAT IN HERE! \nPRISONER I SPIT ON YOU! THE ULTIMATE PENALTY FOR YOU! BURN IN HELL...FOR THE ULTIMATE SIN! PIG! ALL OF YOU! PIGS! \nGUARDS drag the screaming PRISONER from the room. GASPARILLA flops back in his chair, flustered but unscarred. His skin is about a foot thick. He pitches the peach and grabs up a mango. MARY HENRIED enters the chamber and rushes toward an empty chair. GASPARILLA checks THE DOCKET on his desk, smiles, and looks up at MARY. \nGASPARILLA Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'. \nMARY I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab. \n", "test3_id": 1343}

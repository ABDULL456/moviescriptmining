{"test1_input": "RHODES grins as he watches the spectacle. \nSuddenly, A LOUD GUNSHOT startles the captain. He drops the binoculars and spins around. He sees... \n...CHICO'S BODY DANGLING ON THE ROPE. CHICO'S HEAD IS BLOODY. He's dead...and won't come back to life. He's been shot through the brain. \nRHODES WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? \nSOLDIERS stand around dumbly. Those with RIFLES in their hands quickly sling them onto their shoulders. They're all afraid of the captain's wrath. RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in his eyes. \nRHODES Goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who fired that shot or I'll have every last one of you chopped up for feed!!! \nHis eyes spot TOBY, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his rifle slung. \nRHODES Step up here, Tyler. \nTOBY Sir! \nTOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister. \nRHODES You fired that shot, didn't you? \nTOBY No, sir. \nRHODES Let me see your weapon. \nTOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it. \nRHODES It's been fired. \nTOBY In the battle, sir. \nRHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly. \nRHODES It may be that none of these chicken-shits will talk while the whole troop is present...but I know some of these men well. I'm sure that a few private conversations will tell me what I already know. You may have earned yourself some time in the Stalag, Tyler. (Rhodes glances over at CHICO'S body) Cut him down. That's another head for you to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take the rest of his body down to the freezers. Move it, shit hill. \nTOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns. \nCUT TO: \n73\tINT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING \nThere's that GIANT SOUND again, the RUMBLE OF THE ELEVATOR. We're inside the place called THE CAVE, in a huge under-ground concrete bunker. TECHNICIANS AND ARMED GUARDS bustle around. Enormous hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from the surface. Riding on board, RHODES AND HIS PLATOON prepare to unload their paraphernalia. \n74\tEXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING \nSARAH, sweating, exhausted, BLEEDING FROM CUTS made by jungle branches, wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve. She has dipped it into a jungle stream. Cautiously she tastes the water, decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth. \nThe NIGHT BIRDS suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes SARAH look up. Standing across the stream, only ten feet away, is A PARTICULARLY GROTESQUE ZOMBIE. VULTURES stand on the marshy ground beside the creature's legs, THEIR SHARP BEAKS PICKING BLOODY HOLES IN ITS ANKLES AND FEET. \nSARAH jumps to her feet, fighting back exhaustion one more time. She unslings her RIFLE, aims it, then thinks better of firing. Grabbing up her SUPPLY PACK she runs into the darkening jungle. \n75\tEXT.\tTHE JUNGLE - EVENING \nWHAM! TWO BIG HANDS GRAB SARAH by her shoulders. She starts to scream but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth. \nJOHN It's alright. It's alright. Don't be afraid. We're friends. \nSARAH looks into the strong, good face of JOHN, a tall muscular man, a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes that seem instantly trustworthy. \nJOHN There are soldiers near here. Guards. I'll take my hand away if you won't scream. \nSARAH nods and JOHN lets her go. There are two other humans standing behind the big man. There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease- covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing \"Come on! Let's get outa here!\" with her hands. \n", "test1_true": "THE GROUP starts moving. SARAH follows voluntarily. We notice that all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles. \n76\tEXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING \nTHE GROUP trudges through thick brushland, occasionally needing to chop a path with their blades. JOHN speaks in low tones as they move. \nJOHN Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island. \nSARAH Gasparilla? \nJOHN He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson. \nSARAH Governor Dickerson? Of Florida? \nJOHN That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course. \nSARAH We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns. \nJOHN Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything. \nSPIDER is signing for everyone to be quiet. They all stop in their tracks. BILL McDERMOTT swigs some more brandy. With the stealth of a Mohican SPIDER pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and peers through. \n77\tEXT. ENTRANCE TWO - EVENING \nThere's A HATCHWAY in sight built into A CONCRETE, BUNKER LIKE STRUCTURE. FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS are coming up out of the ground. They're armed with PRODS AND RIFLES. \nBehind the men, lurching on unsteady feet, come A HALF-DOZEN OF THE LIVING DEAD, all wearing vests of white and blue. \nBehind the lumbering creatures come A WOMAN AND A MAN both wearing white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards. The woman is MARY HENRIED, one of the top behaviouralists in The Cave. (We'll learn a lot more about her later.) \nTHE ZOMBIES are pushing through the undergrowth right in the direction of SARAH and her friends. SARAH shows some alarm at this but JOHN calms her with a strong hand. \nSPIDER has seen the approaching danger. She silently draws A FARMER'S SICKLE from her belt. (With her other hand she draws A PISTOL for good measure.) BILL McDERMOTT unarmed, nervously takes another swallow from his flask. \nTHE ZOMBIES are getting closer. Too close for comfort. \nFinally, MARY HENRIED and THE OTHERS turn and disappear into the bunker. The last man down pulls the hatch shut. \nThe moment the coast is clear, SPIDER AND JOHN jump up from cover. THE OTHERS follow their lead. But it's too late. THE ZOMBIES have spotted them. The creatures begin to growl and make AGITATED, APE- LIKE SOUNDS. SPIDER brings her BLADE up chest-high, ready to repel an attack. SARAH lifts her own MACHETE but JOHN reaches over and takes it away from her. \nJOHN Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind me. \n(SARAH resists, not understanding, somewhat insulted.) \nYou ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught not to touch the ones with the circles. There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they leave us alone. The colour on their vests tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's the ones without colours you gotta watch out for. \nSARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his back. \nTHE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket. ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking. \nANOTHER ZOMBIE, a \"white\", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN, growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes two angry steps towards the humans who back away. \nTHE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL. BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground. \nMcDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty. \nMcDERMOTT Sorry. Guess I don't know my own strength. \nJOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman. \nSARAH Thanks. I can fight my own battles. \n", "test1_id": 1341, "test2_input": "RHODES HENRIED! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? \nWithout answering, MARY leads her band through A MANUAL DOOR that leads to the Dormitory. \nRHODES STOP THEM! SHOOT! \nSOLDIER The...the children, sir. \nRHODES After them then! I want them stopped! That woman is dangerous! \n148\tINT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY - NIGHT \nMARY AND HER REFUGEES are stopped in their tracks by BUB AND HIS CADRE OF RED COATS. THE NURSE screams and tries to back away. THE CHILDREN cling to her, petrified, shrieking, starting to cry. \nBUB lumbers up to MARY and...salutes. MARY returns the formality. \nMARY It's alright. I don't think they'll hurt us. Try to stay calm. \n149\tINT. THE OUTER CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nTHE MANUAL DOOR has been locked from inside. \nRHODES SHOOT IT OPEN! \nTHE SOLDIERS follow orders, TWO OF THEM FIRING AT THE LOCK. \n150\tINT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT \nMARY is at A CABINET pulling out PISTOLS AND RIFLES, passing the weapons around to TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON. BUB is strapping on his TWO- GUN HOLSTER SET all by himself, fumbling a little, but succeeding. \n151\tINT. THE CORRIDOR WITH RHODES - NIGHT \nRHODES' MEN kick open the door and charge into the Dormitory corridor. \n152\tINT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT \nTHE NURSE slams ANOTHER MANUAL DOOR, locking and bolting it. \nNURSE They're coming! They're coming! \nShe hurries along the caged alley behind the firing stalls guiding THE CHILDREN to an opposite exit. \nBLAM! BLAM! MARY IS FIRING at AN ORANGE CIRCLE VEST on one of the cut out target figures in the range. THE RED COATS are watching with curiosity, cocking their heads. \nMARY moves to fire again but BLUTO grabs her hand. \nMARY NO...BLUTO...I'M TRYING TO... \nThe dumb creature keeps his grip. MARY has to appease to him. She grasps his hand and shakes vigorously. When he finally lets go, she aims her PISTOL again and FIRES AT THE VEST SEVERAL MORE TIMES. \nMARY Look. It's good to shoot the circles. Good. Good. \nTHE ZOMBIES are confused. Exasperated, MARY tears off her own vest and tosses it down the alley. THE RED COATS look befuddled, and a little angry. MARY FIRES at the vest she threw down. TWO BULLETS HIT IT before MARY'S PISTOL CLICKS...empty. \nThere's A POUNDING AT THE DOOR. It's RHODES AND HIS TROOP. \nSuddenly BUB steps into position. WHAP! One of his famous quick draws! BLAM!!! HE FIRES. THE VEST ON THE FLOOR, MARY'S VEST, IS HIT. BUB FIRES AGAIN, the other gun this time. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS HIT squarely in the center of its orange circle. \nTONTO now turns. He lifts his PISTOL and FIRES. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS HIT AGAIN, off center, but hit. \nMARY THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! \nSuddenly THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE RANGE FLIES OPEN. THREE OF RHODES' MEN RUSH IN, wearing, of course, orange circles. THE RED COATS OPEN FIRE. THE TROOPERS ARE CUT TO RIBBONS. Others outside the door duck back behind the walls. \n", "test2_true": "She turns and hurries off. BUB joins his fellows in pursuit of Rhodes' and his men. \n153\tINT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT \nA WOMAN'S FACE IS FULL SCREEN. She is screaming in agony as she is TORN APART BY ZOMBIES. The creatures have invaded the gymnasium. They're CLAWING AT THE FAT-CAT COUNCILLORS, MAULING THEIR WOMEN. \nGASPARILLA AND TWO OTHER MEN are rolling around crazily, bumping into exercise machines, knocking over wine bottles and tables full of hors-d'oeuvres. The single vest they are fighting over rips apart into two pieces, its orange circle severed into two useless halves. \nGASPARILLA backs across the floor, his blubber bouncing. He has a tattered piece of the vest clutched in his hands. He tries to spread it out on his chest but it's too late... and THE ZOMBIES are too hungry...much too hungry. \nMONTAGE: as ALL OVER THE ROOM THEY STRIKE. This is it, gore fans. The gross finale. The intestine-tugger. THE ZOMBIES GET THEIR SUPPER. THEY FEAST AMONG THE PILLOWS, like Romans at an orgy. MUSIC still plays over the gymnasium speakers, rock-a-billy in a gleeful tempo. \nGASPARILLA has retreated into his tanning-coffin but a pudgy arm and a leg are dangling outside. ZOMBIES CHEW HUNGRILY on the juicy morsels. From inside the coffin, where ultraviolet glows brightly, come the piercing, agonised screams of the fat General. \n154\tINT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT \nDIESEL guides SPIDER through the huge earthen archways. ZOMBIES here are scattered now, but they provide for delays. DIESEL FIRES and ZOMBIES ARE HIT but few are hit fatally. DIESEL'S free arm can't fire accurately while he's trying to support the walking bomb beside him. \nDIESEL stops to check his map. A ZOMBIE looms up behind him and takes a HUGE BITE OUT OF HIS SHOULDER. DIESEL screams. He lets go of SPIDER who stumbles away from him, almost falling but saving herself. Her eyes are bugging with pain. \nDIESEL FIRES POINT BLANK AT THE ZOMBIE, BLOWING ITS HEAD TO BITS. MORE CREATURES are pressing in close. DIESEL bats at one, kicks another, punches a third. Then he rushes to SPIDER'S side and scoops her into his arms again. Wincing in pain from THE BLEEDING WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER he manages to move out of immediate danger. \nTHE ZOMBIES lumber after the two, groaning in chorus as they walk. \n155\tINT. THE CORRIDOR AT EXIT FIVE - NIGHT \nMARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN come charging down the hall. TOBY, SARAH, AND JOHN are waiting for them near the open door which leads out into the jungle. TOBY AND MARY rush into each other's arms and they flee, with the others, out into the night. \n156\tINT. A CORRIDOR NEAR THE DORMITORY - NIGHT \nRHODES AND HIS MEN rush into another corridor where they are met by a crowd of DROOLING ZOMBIES. THE MEN OPEN FIRE but the ZOMBIES are too close in. They get the upper hand. \nRHODES FIRES HIS MAGNUM, his eyes insane, his face boiling red with disbelief. After TWO SHOTS BLAST OPEN THE HEADS OF THE CLOSEST ZOMBIES, THE MAGNUM just CLICK-CLICK-CLICKS! RHODES is out of lead. \nHe's grabbed by ONE ZOMBIE, then ANOTHER. He fights to free himself but HE'S BITTEN ONCE...TWICE... \nBLEEDING, he fights on. He struggles to a doorway and pushes through. \n157\tINT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nRHODES comes face-to-face with...you guessed it...big BUB. THE ZOMBIE faces off, ready to draw those SIX-GUNS that hang at his hips. RHODES turns and runs. \nWHAP! BUB slaps leather. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! RHODES turns a corner but ONE BULLET BITES HIM ON THE BACK OF HIS SHOULDER. Terrified, fighting pain, he staggers on with the gun-totin' RED COAT following behind. \n158\tEXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT \nTHE REBELS lead MARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN through the underneath. TRICKS is bleeding badly. TOBY helps him along. Suddenly, as they break into a clearing, SARAH stops cold. There on the ground, lying where we last saw it, is THE CORPSE OF MIGUEL. \nJOHN What is it? \nSARAH It's...he was...one who came to the island with me. \nTOBY Come on. No time. \nSARAH He was killed...five days ago. \nMARY Maybe...maybe he wasn't dead. Are you sure he was dead when you left him? \nSARAH Look at him. A hundred bullets. You tell me. Was he dead? \nThere are tears in SARAH'S eyes. \n", "test2_id": 1342, "test3_input": "SARAH Five days...and he hasn't...risen. He hasn't risen. \nTOBY Come on. There's no time. There's no time to lose. \nTHE GROUP pushes ahead. SARAH kneels. She blesses herself and makes the sign of the cross over the corpse. Then she stands to see that JOHN is waiting for her. He holds out his hand, she takes it and follows the others. \n159\tEXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT \nTHE SOLDIERS aboard THE FISHING BOAT hear NOISES coming from the surrounding jungle. \nSOLDIER WHO IS IT? WHO'S OUT THERE? \nJOHN (o.s.) WE WANT THE BOAT! DROP YER GUNS OR WE'LL BLAST YOU! \nTHE SOLDIERS hesitate, looking around at the dark jungle. \nTOBY (o.s.) WE GOT YOU SURROUNDED! \nA SUDDEN BURST OF AUTOMATIC FIRE LIGHTS UP THE BLACK FOLIAGE. THE SOLDIERS react, flinging their WEAPONS over the side into the water. \nTHE REFUGEES spill out of the undergrowth and scramble over to the boat, lifting THE CHILDREN and THE WOUNDED TRICKS on board carefully. \nJOHN pauses to look back into the jungle. \nJOHN Damn you, island. Damn you ta Hell and worse! \nMcDERMOTT We ain't outa here yet. Get yer ass movin' ya dumb bastard. \nMcDERMOTT tries to slug from his flask, finds it empty. With a shrug he tosses the thing into the backwater. THE ENGINE STARTS as JOHN climbs aboard, SARAH AND TOBY giving him their hands. \n160\tINT. THE MAIN CHAMBER WITH DIESEL AND SPIDER - NIGHT \n161\tINT. THE LABORATORY AREA WITH RHODES AND BUB - NIGHT \n(These two sequences will be intercut for parallel action) \nZOMBIES are crawling all over DIESEL now. He fights them off valiantly but his super strength is waning. HE IS BITTEN AGAIN AND AGAIN but he tries to keep himself between THE CLUTCHING CREATURES AND THE LITTLE DEAF MUTE who is stumbling along ahead. She's getting very close to a huge SET OF CONCRETE SLABS...THE DOORS TO THE POWDER MAGAZINE. \nMeanwhile RHODES approaches another corner in the hallway near the Conditioning Room. BUB follows, his boot heels CLICKING the way RHODES' own heels once clicked. \nRHODES dives for the corner. BUB slaps leather and FIRES OFF ALL TWELVE. RHODES rolls on the ground crazily. HE'S HIT SEVERAL TIMES...but he's still alive. He pulls himself, in agony, out of range. Calmly, BUB dumps out his spent shells and starts to reload. \nIN THE MAIN CHAMBER, DIESEL IS OVERCOME, DRAGGED DOWN BY A MOB OF ZOMBIES. THEY START TO TEAR HIM APART BIT BY BIT. \nSPIDER walks on alone. She is just a few feet from the POWDER MAGAZINE now. A ZOMBIE grabs her from behind but just gets a handful of shirt. SPIDER reaches forward but the creature holds her back. Her SHIRT IS RUNNING RIVERS OF BLOOD NOW where the vials are implanted underneath. \nRHODES crashes through a doorway into THE CONDITIONING ROOM. He realises, too late, that there's no exit. BUB'S BOOTHEELS are getting LOUDER. RHODES crawls around behind THE TABLES FULL OF TESTING EQUIPMENT, WOODEN SHAPES, FLASH CARDS SCATTER. Over near the LARGE COLOURED SYMBOLS which are mounted on the wall there's A WEAPONS CABINET. RHODES grabs a chair and smashes open the glass. \nBUB steps into the open doorway, still reloading his PISTOLS. He stands there, a golem, his fingers slowly, calmly working. He drops a shell or two but soon the barrels are filled with fresh loads. \nRHODES reaches in through the broken glass and pulls out AN AUTOMATIC. \nBUB slaps his PISTOLS back into their HOLSTERS and face off. \nRHODES lifts the AUTOMATIC...aims... \nBUB DRAWS! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EACH ONE OF THE TWELVE BULLETS HITS RHODES SOMEWHERE, many of them in the \"kill-zones\". He screams when the first few rounds hit, but his screaming stops about halfway through the barrage. That's when he dies. His leg bones support his corpse long enough for the last six bullets to reach him. Then, as THE SOUND OF BUB'S GUN ECHOES AWAY down the corridors, RHODES BODY slides down the wall and crumples to the floor in a heap, leaving MUCH OF HIS BLOOD on the ORANGE CIRCLE that's mounted behind him. \nIN THE MAIN CHAMBER, A ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF SPIDER'S SHOULDER. IT PULLS OUT A BIG CHUNK OF FLESH, AND WITH IT, STUCK IN THE CREATURE'S TEETH, COMES ONE OF THE NITRO VIALS. \nSEVERAL ZOMBIES are pulling at the woman. She is still reaching for the POWDER MAGAZINE DOORS but the ghouls are pulling her away. \nTHE CREATURE WITH THE TEST TUBE IN ITS MOUTH pulls the bothersome thing out from between its teeth. It studies the vial curiously for a moment, then it tosses it angrily towards SPIDER, toward THE MAGAZINE DOOR... \n", "test3_true": "162\tINT. THE MAIN CHAMBER (EFX) - NIGHT \nA HALLACIOUS FIREBALL RIPS THROUGH THE CAVE. \n163\tINT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT \nBUB stands in the open doorway staring at RHODES' still twitching corpse. He slaps his SIX-GUNS back into their leather HOLSTERS, then he shoots off one of those military salutes of his....just as the walls fall in on him. \n164\tEXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nTHE REFUGEES stare toward the island as A HUGE BOOOOOM FILLS THE NIGHT. Some of the YOUNGER CHILDREN start to cheer as though watching fireworks on the Fourth of July. \n165\tEXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (THEIR P.O.V.) - NIGHT \nTHE TOP BLOWS OFF THE ISLAND, just as TOBY predicted is would. It's as though an enormous underground volcano is exploding. It's a frightening...yet beautiful sight. \n166\tEXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nTOBY looks back over his shoulder. THE NURSE is kneeling beside the body of TRICKS. He's dead. The woman pulls a blanket up over his head. TOBY steps forward, his PISTOL drawn. He pulls the hammer back and aims at TRICKS' head. \nSARAH No. Don't. Wait. Wait to see if... wait until it's necessary. \nTOBY turns and looks at MARY. She nods. He releases the PISTOL HAMMER without firing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n167\tEXT. ANOTHER ISLAND (WIDE EST.) - MORNING \nGorgeous, a paradise. BIRDSONG fills the air. \n168\tEXT. A RIVER ON THE ISLAND - MORNING \nTHE REGUGEES are all gathered. THE CHILDREN walk, one by one, through the shallows as JOHN baptises them. SARAH, MARY AND THE NURSE carry the infants. When the infant in SARAH'S arms has been touched by JOHN'S hand, SARAH doesn't move on. Instead, she looks up into the big man's warm eyes. \nSARAH Me too...please. \nJOHN gently cups a handful of river water and pours it on the woman's forehead. \nTHE OTHER ADULTS, led by LUKEY, file into the river, all lining up before the baptist, waiting their turns to be blessed into this tiny new society. \n169\tEXT. A BEACH ON THE ISLAND - MORNING \nTRICKS' BODY lies covered in the sand. THE REFUGEES are gathered again, heads bowed, while JOHN speaks. \nJOHN Satan ain't sent this man back. Not yet, anyway. So we all hopin' that maybe he's up there with you, Lord. This might be the first decent soul we been able ta offer ya in quite a few years. That's a fact. We just gonna... pray, Lord. We gonna pray that what seems ta be happenin' here...is really happenin'...and I'm gonna take the chance and speak these words that I ain't been able ta speak for so long... \nMay he rest in peace \nTHE OTHERS Amen. \n170\tEXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT \nTHE CORPSE lies in the MOONLIGHT. NIGHT CRITTERS SCREECH AND BURBLE in the jungle behind the sand. It's an eerie scene. \nSARAH is sitting up, her RIFLE ready in her lap, watching the body. JOHN steps in behind and she startles. \nJOHN Just me. I'll take the next shift. \nHe settles easily down beside the woman. The two stare together at the shrouded corpse. \nSARAH How long do we have to watch him? \n", "test3_id": 1343}

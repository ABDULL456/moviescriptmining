Ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the well. She's wrapped in blankets. The farm is somewhat unkempt and so is she. The hem of her skirt is frayed. She rips at it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism. Then she looks up to see the horseman approaching. It's Teague. Ada immediately heads inside the house. 
Teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of RABBITS from his saddlebag. He heads for the gate. The gate needs oiling, the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the abandoned pitcher. 
Ada opens the door, pinning her hair. 
TEAGUE It's taken me too long, but I've come to pay my respects. 
ADA Thank you. 
TEAGUE (hands over the rabbits) I reckoned you might need fattening up. 
Ada takes them. She is very queasy with these dead animals. 
TEAGUE This house must bring bad luck. Killed my granddaddy to lose it, then my daddy died on account of not having it, then your daddy died on account of getting it. We should burn it down. 
ADA Didn't somebody try? 
TEAGUE Lot to manage without help. Need a hand with that pump? 
ADA No. 
TEAGUE I'm happy to volunteer. 
ADA But not to volunteer for the war? 
TEAGUE The war? I wanted to go. But you know: too old, too literate. Plus I got no spleen. Lost it from a horse's kick. 
ADA You've got no spleen. 
TEAGUE That's the thing about an organ. You don't know you need it till you lost it. (suddenly busy with a bayonet) I want to clear this path. I can just as soon do it and talk as stand around and talk. Then you can say men beat a path to your door. 
ADA I'd really prefer it if you didn't do that. 
TEAGUE Would you rather I did my job? (scything at the path) See if there's any material I should confiscate. For the war effort. 
ADA I was raised in the good manners of the South where a gentleman doesn't enter a house with a woman alone. 
TEAGUE (now he's at the pump) Good manners didn't quite make it to these mountains. If it don't yield meat, or you can't sit on it, or suck on it... (he gets the pump going, water pours out) And you're sleeping all right? These cold dark nights? 
ADA I'm sleeping fine. 
TEAGUE It's going to be a long hard winter. 
He turns and stops at the gate, runs his hands through his hair and uses the grease to ease the hinge. Then steps up onto his horse, and rides away. Ada watches him. Shudders. 
INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT 
Ada comes into the kitchen. A weak oil-lamp reveals THE TWO RABBITS, partially covered on a plate, flies buzzing around them, a little liquid leaking from them. Ada takes a knife and contemplates skinning gutting them. Suddenly she gathers them up and runs out. 
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT 
ADA BURIES THE TWO RABBITS. The wind howls. She covers the little hole with soil and stones. Pumps out water to wash her hands. Thinks she hears a noise, listens, alert to any unfamiliar sounds, then hurries back to the house. 
INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT 
Ada comes inside, she closes the door. Locks it. Puts a chair against it. Goes upstairs, to her bedroom. 
INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT 
Ada enters her bedroom. It's a chaos of books, clothes, dishes. She closes the door, sets another chair against it. 
Then drags her armchair up against that, books and papers spilling onto the floor. She props up Inman's portrait, on, the chair, as if he were guarding her. Sits on the bed and, desolate, begins to write: 
EXT. THE OCEAN BY THE HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY 
ADA (V.O.) Should I imagine you are dead and, that it is to your spirit I am writing? No word from you in all this time. If you receive this please know I am here and warring, too, with a faint heart. 
THERAPY FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS. Some of those convalescing swim or are helped to paddle in the healing sea. There are rudimentary wheelchairs. Inman, a long way from home, is amongst those sitting in one of these, very still, grey and sick -- but alive. He pulls at the dressing on his neck, exposing the still raw and livid wound to the sea air. 
Inman has his Bartram, his bookmark is the battered and foxed picture of Ada, which he considers, before continuing to read. 
Behind him A HUNDRED SLAVES AT WORK IN THE FIELDS, and behind them the Mansion which has become the hospital. A series of bells, of shouts, and the slaves stop working, prepare for the long walk home, congregating, then forming a line, herded by the foremen. 
Inman eases his position to bend over and dip his bandage in the seawater. He brings the wet bandage to his neck, considers the ocean, his fellow ragtag of wounded, the slaves, the great fields, the Mansion. The whole meaning of this war around him. A GRAVEL VOICE STARTS TO SING THE BLUES, CONTINUES AS -- 
EXT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DUSK 
The men return to the Hospital. A BLIND MAN IS SELLING PEANUTS which he roasts over a small fire. HE'S SINGING AS -- 
EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
-- A tintype of OAKLEY is added to the Chapel's votives, hammered in alongside Rourke and Butcher. There are fifty or more images now, the paint flaking around them. The exterior of the Chapel, three years on, has taken on the burden of recording history. 
There is no minister, no services, just the votives, daguerreotypes or simply the names of those missing in action, accompanied by tiny vases of wildflowers. The town shrouded in mist, and quiet. 
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. SPRING. DAY

UNDERGROUND CELLS 
Mr. Pick leans against a door, trying to keep back the howling horde of prisoners pushing from the other side. Another JAILER joins him, helping him to try and push the door closed.  Then a SECOND JAILER too.  A bestial hand reaches through and Mr. Pick presses his pistol muzzle into the outstretched palm -- 
BANG! 
-- A book falls to the floor like a pistol-shot -- and Kafka hides back in shadows hoping no one heard.  He's in a round -- 
LIBRARY 
-- Surrounded by books from floor to ceiling, even on the tall door through which he entered.  A sliver of light gives it away -- and on the other side of it he hears FOOTSTEPS. But they pass by. 
There's another sliver of light indicating another door in the books opposite him.  He walks over and pulls on the shelves.  Here the dark wood is merely a disguising cover for the shiny modern steel he discovers on the other side of it And he finds more than that as he enters -- 
THE LABORATORY 
A real mad scientist's workshop.  Chemicals of bizarre colors rush and FIZZ through mazes of glass pipes and beakers, in some places boiling and steaming, in others frosting or freezing.  Circuits and test tubes flash and glow as sparks and filamentary arcs CRACKLE with electric incandescence. insane instruments and devices, interconnected with complex wires, perform strange and villainous functions.  It's the most modern setting we've yet seen -- but at the same time all this futuristic technology seems somehow archaic, as if put together from old, familiar materials and elements, both eccentric and eclectic. 
The chain that runs through the floors of the Castle carrying documents runs up and down through the laboratory too. 
Amidst this feast for the eyes, what Kafka now focuses in on a simple cigarette -- left smoking in an ashtray.  And by the look of the ash, not very long ago.  Kafka looks around anxiously -- notices an archway leading to another room.

UNDERGROUND CRYPT 
Mr  Pick and the two Jailers can't hold back the dreadful prisoners any longer.  Mr. Pick runs, letting the Jailers fend for themselves.

LABORATORY - SMALLER ROOM 
Kafka comes into what looks like a small museum -- vertical glass cases in which naked BODIES float suspended in preserving gelatin solution. 
Kafka seems deadened himself by all that he's seeing -- until he sees someone he recognizes.  The Bearded Anarchist.  Kafka goes closer.  Looking down, he sees that the Bearded Anarchist has a hand missing.  The other anarchists are here in glass cases too.  Now with a gasp Kafka turns around -- looking for Gabriela -- but she's not here.

MAIN LAB 
Holding himself together, and with new determination etched on his face, Kafka walks to the center of the lab -- and an operating table.  Ignoring the implications of the table, he sets down the bomb-briefcase -- flicking the latches to open it. 
The sight of the explosive mechanism inside causes him a moment's hesitation, but a look round at various animal parts hanging from hooks above the table or bobbing in jars alongside sinister implements laid out in preparation for an operation renews his anger -- and he decisively turns the dial on the bomb's timer-clock, setting it to the maximum allowance of one hour. 
He closes the case and locks its latches.  The case begins to TICK. 
Kafka takes it to a dark spot beneath the mass of elaborate laboratory equipment, hides it under there, and leaves. 
CUT: 
CORRIDOR 
Kafka tries finding his way back the way he came. 
END OF CORRIDOR 
Kafka looks down a long dark staircase -- a hint of light glowing at the bottom. 
BOTTOM OF STAIRCASE 
Just as he reaches the light something lunges at him from one side!  It's the Laughing Man, hysterical as ever, face now SEEN for the first time, SCREECHING, salivating, eyes watering.  The human hyena.  His grin contorts his face from ear to ear, his CACKLING is truly terrifying, and the hand he stretches forward has a tattoo on it (Bearded Anarchist's hand) -- a hand too big for his wrist -- reaching, reaching, reaching for Kafka. 
CUT: 
DARK OFFICE - NIGHT 
The Laughing Man pushes Kafka down into a chair and shakes with uncontrollable sobbing shrieks.

VINCE Hey -- I sleep great every night -- (beat; softer) -- what if she's disappointed in me? LINDA (pats the bed) C'mere. VINCE (final sit-up) Five hundred. (gets up) Don't want to overdo. He goes into her arms. LINDA If she's disappointed in you, then she's a fake -- who could want more from a son? VINCE (thinking about it) You're right. (a beat) I couldn't do this without you, Linda. 
LINDA I know. That's why, when we get back, I think we should move in together. VINCE (threatened) Whoa!   Move in together? LINDA I'm not saying we have to    get married or anything, and    it's not about me wanting to keep    an eye on you, either. (warmly) I just want to live with    you. 
VINCE I'm no good at playing house -- I'm grouchy in the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night -- (CONTINUED)

VINCE Why don't we sleep on this, okay? I mean, I've got a big day tomorrow. (shifting gears) It's gonna be great -- taking my best girl to meet my mom. 
LINDA Am I really your best girl? VINCE There's nobody else, Linda, not anymore. LINDA There better not be, because... (quoting) 'I only have eyes for you...' They kiss.

Marnie has obviously just had the sexual experience of her life. Julius is equally dazed and happy. MARNIE Are you sure you've never done this before? 
JULIUS I think I would have remembered... 
They start to kiss and we start to hear four RAUCOUS VOICES singing a great old ROCK SONG a capella. CUT TO:

VINCE Good idea. One bunch from me, one from Jules. 
MARNIE And one from us -- Julius smiles happily at Vince's thoughtfulness.

In the mountains, which dramatically tower over a lovely, wide park-like area with a large adobe building and a few smaller satellite huts. The car drives up a long, dusty driveway to the entrance, which is protected by high gates. Our principals exit the car. They approach the fortress-like gated entrance, gazing around at the magnificent scenery. Both men carry flowers and seem self-conscious about the prospect of finally meeting their mother. JULIUS It's very beautiful, isn't it, Vince? VINCE Not to mention valuable -- real estate like this must be worth a fortune. 
JULIUS (a rebuke) You mustn't always think of money. 
VINCE (innocent) You got me wrong -- I'm just saying it's nice Mom's loaded -- that's a worry she won't have to have in her old age. Julius smiles at Vince and rings the bell. A MALE CUSTODIAN answers the door -- friendly but very firm. 
CUSTODIAN Can I help you? (CONTINUED)

As he starts to close the door, Vince takes charge. VINCE We've come a long way. I can assure you she's going to be very happy to see us. CUSTODIAN I suggest you write a letter to the Benedict Foundation stating your business. The Custodian politely closes the door in their faces. VINCE                                     * A foundation?

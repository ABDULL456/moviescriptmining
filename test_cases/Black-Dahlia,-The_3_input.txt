He reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range. 
KAY Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile. 
She spins out of his grasp and makes for her car. She guns the engine and disappears. 
INT. THE HOUSE - SECONDS LATER 
Bucky stands in the middle of the living room, cataloguing the little things. No periodicals on the coffee table, half the record collection gone, no candlesticks. 
He picks up the largest chair (Lee's favorite) and throws it at the wall. Next, Kay's rocking chair shatters the glass cabinets. The coffee table goes through the front window. 
IN THE BEDROOM 
Bucky yanks out all the drawers, turns over the bed. 
IN THE BATHROOM 
he takes a pipe wrench to the sink, crushes the mirror with one blow... 
In a terrible ten rounder with the ghosts of his past Bucky demolishes the dream house, pulls his uniforms out of the closet and bolts out of the house, leaving the door open so scavengers can pick the place clean... 
INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT 
Bucky sits on the bed, his back pushed up against the wall. Eyeball to eyeball with Elizabeth Short, Betty, Liz, the Black Dahlia. 
A collage of photos and file folders... 
VOICE OVER It came on then, big and ugly: bye-bye Bleichert at the bus stop, adios shitbird, has-been, never-was, stool pigeon harness bull. 
EXT. THE SLUMS - LATE NIGHT 
Bucky stands in the worst of slums, his blue uniform a beacon to anyone who would do him harm. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) You traded a good woman for skunk pussy, you've turned everything that's been handed you to pure, undiluted shit, your "I will's" amount to the eighth round at the Academy gym when you stepped into a Blanchard right hand--pratfalling into clover that you turned into horse dung. 
ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION 
No clapsticks this time. Just Betty Short sitting an the couch. She reaches down and pulls off her pumps. Now she reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings. Not sexy. Empty and resigned. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) Bye-bye Betty, Beth, Betsy, Liz, we were a couple of tramps, too bad we didn't meet before 39th and Norton, it just might have worked. Maybe us would've been the one thing we wouldn't have fucked up past redemption... 
EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER 
An apartment complex has been erected at the murder site. 
EXT. AN AERIAL VIEW OF LOS ANGELES - DAY 
ANGLE ON: THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN. As we watch the sign changes, the "D" dropping off the end. It now reads "HOLLYWOODLAN". 
EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DAY 
Bucky, unshaven and out of uniform, leans against his car on a working class residential street. He stares across at a modest Victorian house and the garage behind it. We recognize it hopefully; we've been here before. 
EXT. A GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
It's Cleo Short's apartment. Or at least it used to be. Bucky peers in a window and sees it's filled with junk. 
He walks back towards the street, intent on heading back to his car. on a hunch, he walks up onto the porch of the Victorian house and rings the bell. 
EXT. THE PORCH - SAME 
Footsteps at the door. It opens to reveal another identical twin to Elizabeth Short. 
Bucky is stunned and can't find his tongue. 
GIRL (Boston accent) Can I help you? (no response). Great. Take a hike you big sicko-- 
BUCKY Wait-- 
She begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it back open. 
Cleo Short, Elizabeth's father. 
CLEO SHORT It's all right, dear. I know this pug. 
INT. THE SITTING ROOM - LATER 
The two men arrange themselves in chairs while the Betty look- a-alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind Cleo. 
Bucky tries not to stare. He forces himself to focus on Cleo, who, while five years older, looks much better than last time Bucky saw him. 
CLEO SHORT Came into a little change a while back, managed to trade in that shit shack out back for these digs. (beat) And I don't give a fuck what you think, you and your partner ain't much to look at now. I read the papers. 
Bucky can't deny that. 
The young woman brings in two beers for Bucky and Cleo. Bucky checks her out again. Cleo knows why. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) My youngest, Christine. 
He squeezes her hand affectionately. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) Best housekeeper of the bunch. Can't cook a damn, though. Got her sister's star-eyes for the pictures, damn straight. Thinks she's gonna be another goddamn Jayne Mansfield. Get out of here, Chrissie... 
She rolls her eyes, picks up a newspaper and heads out on the porch. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) Used to be dozens'd stop by, you know. Drive up from Dago or San Berdoo just to snap a shot of the goddamn garage back there. Thought maybe they'd find one of Betty's dresses in the garbage. Jackals. 
BUCKY You didn't move far. 
CLEO SHORT Wouldn't a mattered if I did. (beat) Whatcha here for, mug? I know you ain't smart enough to solve the case, and you ain't dumb enough to still think I did it...I had an alibi. 
BUCKY Tighter'n a popcorn fart. 
CLEO SHORT And that's air tight, mug. Air tight. 
Bucky takes a swig of his beer. Cleo's eyes scour Bucky. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) You're hooked on her still, ain't ya? Ha. That's a plug nickel you can't spend, ain't it, mug? Ha. Yea. Betty'll do that to a fella. Especially someone like you. (off Bucky's look) Like I said, I know you mug. 
BUCKY I just thought...Maybe after all this time...There's something you might have forgot...Anything she might have said... 
Cleo studies him, knows Bucky's a lost soul. He softens for the first time. Leans forward, elbows on knees. Almost looking like a father who'd lost a daughter. 
CLEO SHORT She was a terrible actress. I'm sure folks've told you that. She'd practice in front of the john mirror. Once or twice she got me in on it...Reading parts with her for some audition. She stunk. Even a parent could tell. What Beth was good at was writing. All her teachers used to say that. Not that a grease like me'd know the difference. Maybe she coulda written for the pictures. But she wanted to be an actress like every other silly girl. 
His gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) Your folks still alive? 
BUCKY My father. 
CLEO SHORT (poking) He proud of his son, the ace copper? Or maybe he thought you'd end up champ? 
Bucky shrugs off any talk of his father. Cleo gets it. 
CLEO SHORT Your momma? 
BUCKY She killed herself a long time ago. 
Cleo takes a swig of his beer. 
CLEO SHORT Probably better off then.

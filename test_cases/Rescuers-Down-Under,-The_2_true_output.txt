Jake:    Don't worry ma'am, I'll handle this.  Sparky, you watch the tower, we gotta get this bird to the hospital. 
Wilbur:  Oh.... can't go down, can't go up.  Oh ! Take the bags, take the bags! 
(scene:  an old military hospital vehicle.  Wilbur is being lowered inside by a series of ropes, gears and nursemice.) 
Nursemice:    Heave!  Ho!  Heave!  Ho! 
Wilbur:  Hey, whaddya doin'?  Hey, what... what's going on?  Wait!  Hey wait a minute... just stop everything. 
Bianca:  Wilbur, don't worry.  We'll come back the moment we find the boy. 
Wilbur:  (begging) Wait!  Hey!  Wait a minute!  Don't leave me here, please!  I'm feeling much better now.  I'm even ready to hit the beaches (laughs).  I'm even ready to mambo.  (Wiggles in the restraints). 
Bianca:  Doctor, will he be alright? 
Doctor:  (consoling) Now, now, my dear.  Keep a stiff upper lip.  They all come in with a whimper, and leave with a grin.  Off with you now. Leave everything to me.  Shoo, shoo, off you go. 
(they leave) 
Hop to it ladies, we've got a bent bird on our hands.  Move, move, move, bustle, bustle, bustle.  That's it, ah-ha. 
Wilbur:  Will it, will it hurt doc? 
Doctor:  Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.  (to the nurse mice) Launch the back brace! 
(the "back brace" (a cane) is "launched" to immobilize Wilbur's back.)

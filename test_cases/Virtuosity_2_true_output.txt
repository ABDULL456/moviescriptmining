LINDENMEYER He's developing a hemisphere imbalance. 
MADISON Talk so I can understand. 
LINDENMEYER If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR. 
MADISON Then fix it. 
As Lindenmeyer moves to Parker, Madison stays right with him. Her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head. Lindenmeyer carefully removes one of the neural connectors from Parker's skull cap. Before removing another, he looks for a safe place to put the connector. 
LINDENMEYER I need you to hold this. It can't get any dirt on it. 
Madison is reluctant, but doesn't know what else to do. Lindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free hand. 
LINDENMEYER (CONT ' D) All you have to do is hold the needle at the base. Just make sure not to jab yourself with the point... 
She clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun with her right. Lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector from Parker's skull. 
Holding this second needle at the base, Lindenmeyer makes several adjustments on the neural management computer, then moves slowly back to Madison. 
LINDENMEYER (CONT'D) Hand me the connector nice and... 
He suddenly jabs his neural connector into Madison's right forearm. Madison has no time to react. 10,000 volts of electricity instantly courses through her body. 
Madison drops to the floor, unconscious. The needle she had been holding falls from her grasp, breaking the circuit. She stops being electrocuted. Which saves her life. 
LINDENMEYER (CONT' D) (as Sid 6.7 had said) God, some people are stupid. 
He sits back down at the simulator's main console, and starts to type commands. On the monitor, Parker is visible exiting the shopping mall. 
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL 
Parker races out the door. BOOM! That was left knee cap. He tumbles to the street. His gun flying from his hand. 
Parker crawls desperately toward his weapon. But not fast enough. Sid 6.7 arrives at the weapon first. 
SID 6.7 So close, and yet, so far... 
He kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at Parker's head. 
SID 6.7 (CONT'D) It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale. 
PARKER I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it? 
Sid 6.7 pauses to think about it. 
SID 6.7 (considering the idea) You know, I do want you to see it. 
He shoots Parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his legs useless. 
SID 6.7 (CONT'D) I want you to have a bird's eye view... 
OUTSIDE THE NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED HOLLYWOOD TOWER 
A 67 story monument to engineering brilliance in this land of earthquakes. 6:30 PM. 
ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER 
The view is incredible. You can see from the Pacific to downtown. From LAX to the Hollywood Bowl. Smog must be getting better in the near future. 
Sid 6.7 ties Parker to a chair at the roof's very edge. He is facing downtown. Including the Biltmore Hotel, the location of Mayor Bennett's ReElection Rally. 
SID 6.7 There you go  best seat in the house. 
PARKER (with some surprise) You are going after Mayor Bennett. 
SID 6.7 Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally... 
He walks toward an open stairway door behind them. 
PARKER Aren't you going to watch with me? 
SID 6.7 I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly. 
ON HIS WATCH 
Time is moving backwards. Literally. 
ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER 
Sid 6.7 pauses, then goes over to Parker and checks his watch. It is also moving backwards. A smile of realization spreads slowly across Sid 6.7's face as he admires the beautiful sky above him.

HERMAS If you want to do it  again, you need another chicken  and another fifteen sesterces...  and I'd like the first fifteen now  please. Hector looks a Lucinnius, who nods reluctantly. Hector opens his purse and counts out the coins for Hermas. 
27   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           27 Hector is giving Lucinnius a soothing shoulder massage. 
Lucinnius is still in a talking mood.   His troubles won't allow him to relax. LUCINNIUS Cyprian loaned me half a million to fit out these ships... I'm                           * finished. Just when things were going well... I had plans for you too, Hector... in four or five years I was going to make you a free man... and then in ten years                       * you'd be a citizen... you... you                        * could've found your family... brought them here... everything... 
Hector smiles ruefully. HECTOR It sounds good. Lucinnius misses the irony in Hector's voice and enthuses about his own future generosity. LUCINNIUS It does, doesn't it! Lucinnius is silent for a while as Hector continues to            * rub his shoulders. LUCINNIUS I shouldn't give up. I can't... I'll visit Cyprian, first thing tomorrow... before the others can get to him... he's got to see reason... I can pay him back... sometime. It's the only chance we have, Hector. Should I do it? HECTOR You must. LUCINNIUS You're right.    I must. 
This burst of resolve has relaxed Lucinnius.   His tense muscles yield more to Hector's fingers. THALIA enters the room. She is a household slave, a Nubian from Africa. She carries a lighted torch and moves around the room lighting the wall lamps. Lucinnius watches her. (CONTINUED) 
27   CONTINUED:                                                   27 LUCINNIUS Thalia, I think I need one of your massages. Hector, you can                       * finish the lamps. Hector does as he is told. He takes the torch from Thalia and discreetly leaves the room, hearing Lucinnius as he closes the door. LUCINNIUS Lower, Thalia. 
28   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   28 
Late at night, Hector is still awake. He rises from his bed and quietly moves out of the room. He is careful not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him, some of them sprawled on the floor. He shares his bed- room with at least eight other slaves. Privacy is a master's privilege. 
29   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           29 In the darkened house, Hector makes his way up some stairs and along a passage. The only sound is a crack or two of far-away THUNDER. At the end of the passage, Hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall. He climbs this, and lifts open the trap door above his head. 
30   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT                                            30 Odd flashes of lightning far out to sea are the only source of light as Hector moves across the flat roof. In one corner he sees what he is looking for, the outline of a figure resting against the low parapet wall. He moves towards it. The figure speaks. 
FIGURE I missed you last night. It is Thalia. We can tell that they are close.      Hector sits down beside her. 
HECTOR He kept me working until morning. 
THALIA What's happening? (CONTINUED) 
30   CONTINUED:                                                     30 HECTOR He has no money and a lot of enemies. If he's very clever he'll survive... but the omens are bad... and he's not very clever. 
THALIA She doesn't like him. HECTOR Nobody does. He's unfortunate. You get people like that. Clumsy and sad. Thalia looks out towards the sea. 
THALIA Why does the thunder always stay out on the ocean? Hector puts an arm around Thalia. At first it feels                 * strange, their physical intimacy alongside their matter- of-fact conversation, but gradually we understand it, the giving and taking of comfort where it can be found, and the realness of their friendship. Their stroking and touching and holding becomes good to watch. We get a feeling for what they have given one another, in stolen hours and half hours, up here on the roof, the only place where they can be themselves. HECTOR It's the Gods arguing. They're working out what to do with Lucinnius... he'll be lying awake down there... wondering what they're saying about him. 
They laugh.    Far away some street DOGS BARK. HECTOR If he goes down I'll ask for my freedom... he owes it to me... he said as much... you too... we could be free... 
THALIA Then what? HECTOR What we talk about. 
By now he is kissing her. (CONTINUED) 
30   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                30 THALIA We talk about going home. Yours is that way and mine is that way... your family is that way. HECTOR I just made that up... I don't                           * know which way they are... anyway                        * ... you can't think like that.                           * Not after so many years...                               * 
THALIA It's what you talk about. HECTOR We talk about it because it can                          * never happen. What we do is you                          * and me... THALIA I don't understand. I think you'll leave. You're going to leave me here. 
HECTOR Never. It's you and me now. That's all. THALIA Well.   We stay here.   He'll survive.                   * Hector is silent, still kissing her.      He yawns as he              * speaks. 
HECTOR Then I can see you every night. I'm tired. 
31   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       31 
Hector is back in his bed. A figure enters the room, steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes him awake. Hector comes to. Lucinnius stands over him, whispering. 
LUCINNIUS I can't sleep. Get me a chicken. I want to make another sacrifice. We'll do it ourselves. 
Hector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows Lucinnius out of the room.

PATRICK That's a mistake. He'll never talk to a badge. I know him. If there's a deal to be brokered we're the ones who can do it. 
BRESSANT No. Me and Nick are handling this. This is too important. 
PATRICK If you two go in, negotiate a ransom for a girl, then it is kidnapping and that's the FBI. 
ANGIE All you're gonna do is scare him and the more scared he is the worse it is for her. 
The look at each other. 
PATRICK Do you want to get the kid back or not? 
BRESSANT I'm gonna take that as a rhetorical question. 
PATRICK Sit fuckin' tight. We know him, he111 talk to us and we'll be right back. 
CUT TO: 
A PIPE BEING SMOKED. MARIJUANA BURNS 
INT. CHEESE'S HOUSE, BACK ROOM - MINUTES LATER 
CHEESE Been a long time. 
CHEESE JEAN BAPTISTE sits in frame. He is a wiry, intense man who looks over Patrick and Angie suspiciously. 
Along with Cheese, there are a MAN (CHRIS MULLEN, 30) and a WOMAN (Cheese's Girlfriend, 22, from Laos) . There are flat screen plasma TVs, piles of clothes and nearly sixty boxes of sneakers against one wall. 
Patrick and Angie sit opposite Cheese. Cheese exhales. He gestures to his girlfriend. 
CHEESE (CONT' D) I'm a talk some private shit. 
She starts to go. Chris remains. 
CHEESE (CONT' D) But don't get too far. 
GIRL You know I' 11 be right here. 
He looks them over. He is languid but extremely intimidating. 
CHEESE Bitches love the cheddar. 
Small laugh. 
PATRICK How you been, Chris? 
CHRIS MULLEN Better than you. 
PATRICK Good to hear it. 
CHEESE 
(TO CHRIS) Be cool. 
(BEAT) Been too long not to see a fool. I give you an audience. 
(BEAT) Go. 
Patrick and Anqie exchange looks. He goes. 
PATRICK We found what you were lookin' for in Chelsea. 
CHEESE What makes you think I am concerned with the doings in Chelsea? 
PATRICK Cause I know one of the idiots who robbed you lives there. 
CHEESE What idiot? 
PATRICK The one you just killed. 
CHEESE I don't know about nobody gettin' killed. If someone robbed me and end up dead, you know, life a ma' fucker. 
He looks at Chris, they smile.   Angie leans forward. 
ANGIE Cheese, I appreciate you're seeing us. I know you're busy so we' 11 be quick. 
(BEAT) We have your money. It was buried in Ray' s backyard. 
(BEAT) We want to give it back to you in exchange for Amanda. The two police outside are the only other people who know. They're willing to risk their careers to do this quietly and they've sent us in here to demonstrate that. They don't want to investigate you or prosecute you for anything -- they just want the girl back. 
CHEESE What you talkin' about?   What girl? 
ANGIE 
(PATIENCE TRIED) You know what girl. Cheese. Amanda McCready. Who has nothing to do with Helene stealing from you. 
(BEAT) Don't punish her for who her mother is. 
(BEAT) Tell us where to meet you, tell us what your terms are and we'll do whatever makes you comfortable. You'll get your money and you made your point. Just give us Amanda. Please. 
Cheese seems confused. 
PATRICK Cheese, look at me. No one gives    a fuck what you did. I never even liked    Ray. You get the money. The girl goes    home to her mother we'll say we found her   in the bushes or whatever. 
CHEESE I donft know.

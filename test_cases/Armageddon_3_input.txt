Golden The situation: the hole is drilled but the remote detonator is not  functional. One of the crew is going to stay behind and.... (deep breath) ...manually detonate the device. 
Golden looks over at Grace. She is stunned. The news is just sinking in. 
Golden Don't stay for this. 
Grace I'm not leaving. 
Temple In 18 minutes we will be at Zero Barrier. (to Grace) Your father better  be a man of his word. 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - CABIN 
PAN FROM HARRY...to A.J. to...to Chick....to Lev...to Bear. Everyone is huddled  inside the cabin. 
The SMASHED REMOTE DETONATOR, a 2000-foot spool-drum of ELECTRICAL WIRE and a  KNIFE sit on the table. 
Sharp (stoically) I'd trade places with any one of you. But we need two people  to fly this mother back. So, we either all stay or you guys draw. 
Sharp raises a BUNDLE OF ELECTRICAL WIRES in his hand. The crew's going to draw  straws. The highest tension yet. No one breathes, no one moves. 
Sharp Who's first? (no response) Clockwise then. 
Sharp holds the WIRE STRAND BUNDLE in front of Lev. 
Lev stares at it. He smiles nervously and reaches...and draws. The strand is  LONG. Lev exhales. Next... 
Chick, Chick stares at the bundle, sweating. He grabs a strand. Pulls slowly.  LONG. He exhales. Next... 
Bear. He stares at the bundle, thinking, choosing. He grabs and pulls quickly,  decisively. LONG. Two strands remain, and two men, Harry and A.J. It's A.J.'s  turn.... 
A.J. stares at the wire strands - not a bundle now. A.J. shifts in his chair.  The matter will be decided on this last pull. A.J. looks at Harry. They lock  eyes. 
Harry Your turn. 
A.J. I ain't gonna draw against you Harry. 
Chick (starts to get up) I can't watch this. 
Harry (stern, hard) Sit down, Chick. 
Chick sits down. Harry looks at A.J. 
Harry Draw. 
A.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He reaches and begins to  pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And pulls. It is SHORT. A.J. stares at  the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in his hand. We see a fear on his face that gets  covered by a small smile. 
A.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to save the Earth. 
A.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his half medallion. 
A.J. We said we'd join these after we drilled the hole. It just ain't gonna be  on Earth. 
They slide the two halves together to make a whole. Harry and A.J. exchange a  long look. 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 
Watts flips switches. Suddenly the jets ignite! 
Watts Ignition! She's started! 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 
Skip turns to Golden excitedly. 
Skip They got Freedom goin'! 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - CARGO BAY 
A.J. and Harry stand in the airlock, helmets on. Harry carries the two thousand  foot spool-drum of wire. The airlock opens. Harry and A.J. descend onto the  asteroid. 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 
Golden looks at the CLOCK running down - ten thirty-three... Ten thirty-two... Ten thirty-one... 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
Harry and A.J. approach the NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's half in, half out of the  drilling hole, as they left it. Harry and A.J. alligator-clamp the end of the  wire spool-drum onto the nuke's DETONATION DEVICE. 
A.J You never answered my question. 
They finish attaching the wire. 
A.J. pulls the piece of TUBULAR ALUMINIUM out of the nuke's ratchet wheel  delivery sled. The NUKE descends downhole, slowly spooling out wire from the  SPOOL DRUM. 
A.J. About Grace, Harry. (laughs nervously) I know it ain't gonna happen now,  but....if things were different...What would you say...? 
Harry walks back toward Freedom. A.J. follows. 
Harry I always wanted a son. And if I had....I'd want him to be like you. 
Harry hands him the pipe section. 
Harry (cont'd) You're going to need some magic in the world. You can marry her, A.J. 
A.J. laughs, being told at this dire time in his life. He looks at Harry with a  hint of bittersweet smile. 
A.J. Mean "could have...?"

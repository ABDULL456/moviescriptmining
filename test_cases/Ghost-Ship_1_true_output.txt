EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor alley. 
It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the deck. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills out of the anchor alley before Epps. 
EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek dangerously close to his face, until... 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A beat as she holds there. 
EPPS Dodge? You alright? 
EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Dodge lies tangled in the winch. 
DODGE Yes! 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY 
Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down into the water and come up again from the water to the tow anchor on the tug's stern. 
Dodge looks on as Greer and Epps stand by. He raises his walkie. 
DODGE Alright, skipper, real easy. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy slowly throttles up, moving the boat forward. He turns to see as the Chimera drops back behind them. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The tug moves slowly away from the Chimera as Epps, Greer and Dodge look on. 
WIDE ON TUG AND CHIMERA 
As the tug widens the distance, leaving the Chimera in place. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy holds the helm steady as the Chimera recedes. 
DODGE Steady as she goes. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Dodge, Epps and Greer look on as the tow cables begin to rise in their wake. 
DODGE (into radio) Throttle back. 
The tug slows as the cables rise slowly from the water. 
DODGE More. 
The tug slows still more. 
DODGE More. 
It slows still more, until the tug just creeps along, and the massive tow cables rise entirely out of the water, straightening as the slack is pulled out. 
EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Some fifty yards behind the tug, the tow cables come taught in the anchor alleys of the Chimera. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy holds the throttle. 
DODGE Right there, skipper. Right there. 
Murphy eases forward on the throttle and the turbines rise in pitch. 
EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
As the tow cables stretch and the bow of the Chimera inches forward. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The turbines grow louder as Greer, Epps, and Dodge look on at the Chimera behind them, the massive tow cables bowing under their own weight.

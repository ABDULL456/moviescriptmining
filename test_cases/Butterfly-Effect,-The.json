{"train": "KAYLEIGH Mommy lives far away but she comes and visits. \nLENNY (to Tommy) If I'm retarded, why didn't my mommy move away from me? \nTommy gets upset. He swipes his hand down Lenny's picture and his macaroni \"mother\" crumbles to the floor. Lenny begins to cry. \nEVAN Hey, what'd you do that for? \nTOMMY Fat little baby, crying for mommy. \nEvan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to Lenny. \nEVAN Come on, Lenny. It's not that bad. You can still see your mom a little. \nLenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of control. His desperate gasps for breath are frightening. \nEvan, scared, looks around for Mrs. Boswell, but cannot find her. He reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his own macaroni \"mother\" apart and places it over Lenny's picture. It's a nuclear family again. Lenny slowly is able to catch his breath. \nLENNY (grateful) Can... can... Can I have this? \nEVAN Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway. \nKayleigh helps Lenny glue a new \"mother\" in place and she smiles gratefully at Evan. \nAs Evan smiles back at Kayleigh, Mrs. Boswell calmly enters the room in time to see Evan tacking up his butchered family portrait. She shivers. \nEXT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY - 1989 \nGothic. Imposing. Andrea runs up the stairs. \nINT. SUNNYVALE - DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nDR. HARLON REDFIELD, 40, a handsome and extremely genial man, scrutinizes a disturbing drawing. \nDR. REDFIELD And you say he doesn't remember any of it? \nANDREA (anxious) Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition? \nDR. REDFIELD Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out. \nAndrea nods and forces a thankful smile. \nDR. REDFIELD Tell you what, bring Evan here tonight and we'll run a CAT-scan series. \nEXT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - NIGHT \nThe looming building looks even more frightening at night. Andrea and Evan head up the stairs. \nEVAN I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures! \nANDREA (lighthearted) You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him. \nINT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - NIGHT \nAndrea leads Evan into Dr. Redfield's office. Dr. Redfield warmly greets Evan at the door. \nDR. REDFIELD Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you. (to Andrea) He's as handsome as his father. \nEVAN (stunned) You know my father? \nBefore Dr. Redfield can answer, Andrea cuts him off. \nANDREA That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss. \nEVAN My father has a bad memory, too? \nDR. REDFIELD (off Andrea's look) Uh, tell you what, Evan. If it's okay with your mother, I'd like to run some tests. Nothing scary. \nEvan raises an eyebrow at the doctor. \nDR. REDFIELD Okay, it might be a little scary... \nINT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER \nEvan looks terrified as he lies on a medical platform as a series of CAT-scan images are taken. In another part of the room, a distressed Andrea speaks quietly with Dr. Redfield. \nANDREA Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness... \nDR. REDFIELD Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory. \nANDREA Anything. \nDR. REDFIELD A journal. Just have him write down everything he does. \nANDREA Why? What for? \nDR. REDFIELD It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days. \nEVAN Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go? \nMR. MILLER Calm down, kid. Stand still. \nEvan backs up and awkwardly scurries around the basement, grabbing his clothes. \nPanicking. \nEVAN I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here? \nMR. MILLER Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been. \nEVAN Kayleigh? What happened? \nKayleigh's eyes are unable to leave the floor. She begins adjusting her disheveled clothing. Evan trembles. \nEVAN What's wrong with me? \nTommy silently watches from the top of the basement stairs, absently wringing the head off one of his sister's dolls. \nINT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY \nDr. Redfield places Evan's CAT-scan slides on the light box. Andrea squints, unable to interpret them. \nDR. REDFIELD Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors... \nANDREA And the bad news? \nDR. REDFIELD Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now. \nANDREA But you must have something to go on? \nDR. REDFIELD If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related. \nANDREA But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have? \nDR. REDFIELD Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad. \nANDREA Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple. \nDR. REDFIELD You'd be surprised how often they are. \nANDREA Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off. \nDR. REDFIELD It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex. \nANDREA How soon?... \nINT. ANDREA'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nEvan, dressed in his Sunday best, writes copiously in a journal marked \"AGE 7.\" \nEVAN'S DIARY \n\"April 15. Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason and he is crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad.\" \nINT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY \nAndrea tightly grips Evan's hand as the pair follow Dr. Redfield down a corridor. Evan's enthusiasm is dampened by the sounds of distant screams and bloodcurdling laughter. \nEVAN Dad lives here? \nDR. REDFIELD Not in this wing, actually. No. \nANDREA Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay? \nEVAN Okay. \nThey walk to the end of the corridor and come to a \"Visitor's Chamber\". \nDr.Redfield leads Evan inside. Andrea begins to follow, but the doctor gestures that she stay outside. \nINT. SUNNYVALE - VISITOR'S CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS \nEvan takes a seat at a long rectangular table. His eyes are fixated on the door on the other side of the room. Finally, a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass. \nJASON, thirty and haggard looking, enters the room. His eyes want to sparkle at seeing his son for the first time. But tranquilizers have dulled the effect. \nEvan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that hinder Jason's movement. Finally Jason sits. \nHe smiles warmly and speaks in over-enunciated tones. \nJASON It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right? \nEVAN Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your -- \nSMASH CUT TO: \nTOMMY What did I say about mentioning that bitch? \nKAYLEIGH (uncomfortable) Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already. \nTOMMY Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already. \nNow at the edge of the woods, Tommy spots: \nEXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOME - CONTINUOUS \nA MAILBOX sits at the end of the driveway. It's exquisite. An exact replica of a Colonial home it serves. \nAcross the street, Tommy hands the blockbuster to Lenny. \nTOMMY Here you go, buddy. \nLENNY (recoiling) What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing. \nTOMMY The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure. \nLENNY Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed. \nEVAN Not necessarily. \nAll eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks off the filter and jams the fuse into the unlit end. \nEVAN That should buy you ten minutes at least. \nLENNY Gee, thanks friend. \nEXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOME - CONTINUOUS \nLenny paces back and forth next to the three-story mailbox, desperately trying to appear nonchalant. He pretends to notice his shoe's untied and bends down to tie it. From the woods, the other kids watch anxiously. \nTOMMY Oh, for Christ's sake, just do it, Lenny. \nFinally, Lenny throws the bomb in the mailbox. Then sprints like hell to the woods. Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and hands it to him when he gets back. \nLENNY (taking puff) Thanks. \nEvan pats Lenny on the back. \nEVAN You got balls, man. \nThe four watch the mailbox in intense anticipation. Evan smiles with the cigarette pressed tightly between his lips and places his hands over Kayleigh's ears. She smiles back at him and presses his hands against her head. Tommy catches this and seems disturbed, and quickly turns back to -- \nThe mailbox. Tick-tock... tick-tock... It's like a staring contest... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. HALPERNS' FOREST - DAY \nEvan, running full speed, comes to in an unfamiliar place. He instantly loses his footing and falls to the ground. Lenny, falling on top of him. \nTOMMY Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on! \nEVAN (frantic) What happened?? Where are we?! \nEvan gets up and starts running, then realizes he's not being followed. Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up and carrying him. Evan realizes that Lenny's completely dazed. Evan doubles back, grabs Lenny's arm and he and Tommy drag Lenny through the woods as fast as they can. \nKAYLEIGH (crying) Oh God... what did we do? \nEVAN Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY \nAndrea's car screeches to the curb of Lenny's house. Lenny's mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads Lenny into an ambulance. \nAs Andrea rushes up to the ambulance, Mrs. Kagan gives her an icy glare and slams the ambulance door in Andrea's face. Andrea turns to Evan, now trembling on the front stoop. \nANDREA What is it? What happened? \nTOMMY (staring menacingly at the others) We were just building a fort in the woods when Lenny freaked out. One minute he was fine, then he just froze up. Right guys? \nANDREA What happened, Evan? The truth. \nEVAN I don't know... I don't remember. \nANDREA Something must've happened! What set him off? \nEVAN I... I blacked out. \nANDREA (building frustration) Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one! \nEvan looks helpless. \nMRS. KAGAN (acidic) Lenny's been through a hell of an ordeal no thanks to you. \nEvan and Kayleigh look guilty as the garage door opens up and Mrs. Kagan continues into the garage. \nINT. LENNY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAlone, Lenny concentrates on a MODEL AIRPLANE. There is a sudden KNOCK at the window. Lenny's head jerks around to see Evan and Kayleigh smiling through the window. \nEXT. LENNY'S WINDOW - CONTINUOUS \nEvan and Kayleigh stand on the ivy-covered trellis. \nEVAN (quietly) Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change. \nKAYLEIGH Hi, Lenny. \nLenny twitches ever-so-slightly. \nLENNY Is Tommy with you guys? \nEvan shakes his head \"no\". \nEVAN It's cool. \nLenny looks back at the model airplane. Needs to think. \nEXT. JUNKYARD WOODS - DAY \nEvan, Lenny and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods. \nKAYLEIGH (to Lenny) So what did you do in there? \nLENNY It was awful. You can't sleep 'cause everyone's screaming all night long. I never want to go back. \nAs Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column of smoke billowing in the horizon. \nKAYLEIGH Do you see that? \nEvan and Kayleigh run toward the smoke. Lenny nervously follows behind. \nThey exit the woods to find: \nEXT. JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nTommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses with lighter fluid. \nNext to a campfire. \nEVAN Crockett!! \nEvan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog. Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks up a wooden plank and SWINGS! Evan ducks back at the last minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head. \nKnocking her unconscious. \nTOMMY Look what you made me do! \nEVAN What's wrong with you?! \nTommy, enraged, fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's knee cap. BASH! Evan doubles over in pain and falls to the ground, clutching his knee. Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid. \nEvan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped in the tied gunny sack. \nEVAN Kayleigh! Wake up! \nNo response. \nTOMMY Why don't you fucking kiss her, Prince Charming! \nTommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from the campfire to the fluid soaked dog. \nAs the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy at FULL SPEED -- \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. JUNKYARD - DAY \nEvan comes to in an unfamiliar place. Still in running mode. His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he is now lying face down on the ground. \nEvan regains himself and sits up painfully. His face is badly bruised and he clutches his battered ribs. \nEVAN How long was I out? \nHe gets no answer from Lenny, who stands in the exact same spot. Tommy is nowhere in sight and the sound is of Kayleigh weeping. Evan spins to face her. \nEVAN Kayleigh?! Are you okay? Where's Crockett? \nKayleigh, her knees drawn tightly to her chest, is unable to answer through her tears. Evan struggles to rise but he becomes dizzy and falls back to the ground. \nTHUMPER Here, bro. Found your T-shirt. \nEvan nods thanks, picks up his journal. Reads something and smiles. \nEVAN Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday. \nTHUMPER I thought you were a December baby. \nEVAN This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts. \nThumper pulls out a bong. \nTHUMPER Let's do this. \nEXT. DIRTY HANK'S BAR - DAY \nINT. DIRTY HANK'S BAR - CONTINUOUS \nA popular watering hole. A dark rustic interior, blasting alternative rock. \nPlenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their tables. \nEvan and Thumper play pool against two young women. HEIDI, beautiful, wears ripped jeans, no make up. She sinks the eleven ball off the rail. KRISTEN coolly smokes a cigarette, confident that she and Heidi will hold the table. \nKRISTEN So... which one of you has a pet worm? \nThumper proudly steps forward. \nTHUMPER Worms, plural. \nKRISTEN That's so gross. \nThumper steps back, points to Evan. \nTHUMPER Talk to him about it, he's got the fetish. \nHeidi sinks another ball and looks up at Evan strangely. \nEVAN Actually, they're for a psych project. A study on memory. \nHeidi misses her shot and passes the cue to Evan. \nHEIDI (stifling a yawn) Shit, better explain before all the excitement gives me a heart attack. \nEvan speaks as he knocks the one-ball in the corner pocket. As he talks, at a table behind them, some obnoxious Greeks, including HUNTER, SPENCER, and GWEN make fun of Thumper. \nEVAN It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever. \nTHUMPER (thoughtfully) Like Ozzy. \nGwen giggles as Spencer throws popcorn at Thumper's head. \nSPENCER Ten bucks says he eats it off the floor. \nThumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the three-ball in the side. \nEVAN You chop up the smart flatworm and feed it to the dumb one and presto, the dumb one suddenly knows the maze inside and out. \nEvan walks past Heidi, putting his hand on her shoulder to squeeze by. The hand lingers longer than necessary and Heidi doesn't mind. He sinks another ball. \nEVAN Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories. \nTHUMPER (thoughtfully) That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart. \nA handful of popcorn hits Thumper's face. They all try to ignore Hunter and Spencer's jeers. \nHEIDI So what's the point? \nEVAN (setting up the eight) Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain. \nAnother barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket. Although his hand clenches on the cue. He meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks. \nHEIDI (intrigued) So are you planning on becoming a doctor or something? \nThumper casually takes the pool cue from Evan. \nEVAN No, I just don't want to lose my mind. \nAs Heidi digests this, Thumper carefully lines up his shot... The eight ball. \nCRASH!!! The cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing into the pitcher of beer on the Greek's table. They're all soaked with beer and debris. \nJust as they begin to rise, Thumper smashes the cue stick on the table, WHISTLING innocently (while now brandishing a spear). They sit the fuck down. \nKristin, impressed, casually wraps her arm around Thumper's waist. He smiles coolly, it's nothing. \nEVAN (to Heidi) I think that's your game. \nWHOOSH OF FLAMES \nAnd Evan passes out. \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002 \nEvan comes to with Heidi slapping him awake. \nEVAN Oh my God! No! No! \nHeidi rolls her eyes. \nHEIDI Wake up, idiot. It was just a dream. \nShe stands and angrily puts on her jacket. \nEVAN (freaked out) It didn't feel like a dream. \nHEIDI Maybe because they never do. (sarcastic) So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates? \nEvan doesn't even hear her. After getting his bearings, he grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded. \nINT. EVAN'S CAR - SUNRISE \nEvan drives... \nEXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY \nEvan, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway. Very little has changed in the past seven years. \nINT. LENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nANGLE ON LENNY \nNow 20, making a model airplane. He's still overweight and looks like his mother dresses him. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nThe room is filled with model airplanes. Hundreds of them. \nA KNOCK on Lenny's bedroom door. Mrs. Kagan, grayer, fatter, opens the door and escorts Evan inside. She glares at Evan while pretending to be cheerful. \nMRS. KAGAN I've got a surprise for you, Lenny. You'll never guess who's here. \nLenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw drops. \nANGLE ON EVAN \nLooking around, shocked to see: \nPAN ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ROOM. \nNothing has changed in the past seven years. \nThe same kids' toys, posters and comic books. \nAS WE PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND TO LENNY \nWe see he's working on the model again, in his own world. The window of opportunity for conversation has closed. \nEVAN Hey, uh, it's me. Evan. \nSilence. Lenny frowns. \nEVAN What's that you're working on? A model? \nNothing. \nEVAN Well, you look busy, so maybe I should make this quick. I'd totally understand if you didn't want to get into this right now, but that day at the junkyard, could you help me remember what happened? Any details? \nNo response. Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk. \nLENNY I couldn't cut the rope. \nEVAN (containing excitement) Yeah, good, what else do you remember? \nLENNY Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep. \nEvan, startled, drops the model on the desk. An epiphany. \nEVAN Jesus Christ. It really happened. \nLenny stares out the window. \nTOMMY C'mon! Run!! \nEvan and Kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run a few steps when they realize that Lenny isn't with them. \nTOMMY Lenny? Come on! \nKAYLEIGH Oh my God oh my God... \nLenny doesn't seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson road. Evan and Tommy double back and grab him. They try to make him break out into a run, but Lenny's feet drag limply against the ground. Both Tommy and Evan grab an arm and begin to run with Lenny through the woods. \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT \nEvan comes to. Lurches his body over the bed and vomits. \nSounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room. Looking sick and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a NEW SCAR from the cigarette burn. \nEVAN What the hell? \nIn the next bed, Thumper's head, wrapped in a blanket, pops up from above a NAKED GESELA'S waist. \nTHUMPER Christ, man. You wanna clean that up before I lose my appetite here? \nEvan sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins of the journal. \nINT. DORM LOBBY - DAY \nThe lobby is decorated with colorful streamers, balloons, posters and banners announcing PARENTS' WEEKEND. \nCarefree STUDENTS and their parents carry shopping bags toward the bustling elevators. Evan leans against the side of a pay phone, holding his ear to drawn out the noise. \nEVAN Yes, hello, uh, Mrs. Kagan, this is Evan Treborn. (rolling eyes) I know. I'm sorry about that. But I really need to speak with him. \nShe's obviously hung up on him. Suddenly, a HAND grabs his shoulder. It's PROFESSOR CARTER. \nPROFESSOR CARTER Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming. \nEVAN Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't... \nPROFESSOR CARTER I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right? \nEvan shrugs and forces a smile. \nPROFESSOR CARTER Just don't drop the ball, okay? \nEVAN I won't let you down, Professor Carter. \nCarter waves to another student and her parents and walks away. \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA waiter clears the dishes away from Evan and Andrea's table. \nREVEAL ANDREA \nHer hair now has gray streaks. As she signs for the bill, she leans over and kisses Evan on the cheek. \nEVAN Please, mom. People will talk. \nANDREA I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes. \nEVAN Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades? \nANDREA (smiling) Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him. \nEVAN Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time? \nAndrea's smile fades. \nANDREA Why do you ask? \nEVAN No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten. \nANDREA When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past. \nEvan tries not to react. \nANDREA I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them... \nEVAN Sure... \nANDREA And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could... \nEVAN What? What could he do? \nEVAN Couldn't you have moved in with your mom? \nKAYLEIGH (shaking her head) She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever. \nThey walk in silence for a moment. \nEVAN Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you. \nKAYLEIGH (brightening) Me? Are you kidding? Why? \nEVAN Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts? \nKAYLEIGH Of course. \nEVAN Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help. \nKAYLEIGH Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot. \nEVAN When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something? \nKAYLEIGH (cold) What do you want to know, Evan? \nEVAN It's just... did he... what happened in the basement? \nKAYLEIGH It was a long time ago. \nEVAN I know, but... \nKAYLEIGH (cold) Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood? \nEVAN No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us. \nKayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette. \nKAYLEIGH Is there a point to any of this? \nEvan's features shift from inquisitory to tenderness. He steps closer to Kayleigh and softly strokes her face. She flinches at first, but remains in the same spot. \nEVAN Whatever happened, it wasn't our fault. You know we couldn't have stopped it. \nKayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow. \nEVAN Look, Kayleigh. This may sound like bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't spoken to you in seven years... \nShe moves her face away from his hand. \nEVAN But you were seven years old and there's nothing you could've done to deserve... \nHer face collapses and she turns away. \nKAYLEIGH (defeated) Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath. \nEVAN You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak. \nKAYLEIGH Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better! \nKayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan. \nKAYLEIGH If I was so wonderful, Evan, why didn't you ever call me? Why'd you leave me here to rot?! \nShe turns and runs away. Evan looks sick with guilt. \nEXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - QUAD - DAY - 2002 \nA few GREEKS play frisbee and talk trash. Evan, tired and depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn scar on his belly. Contemplating... \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT \nEvan enters his dorm. He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong. He chokes out a message. \nTHUMPER Some dude left a message for you. \nEvan puts a towel under the door. \nEVAN You can smell it all the way in the bathroom. \nEvan hits \"play\" on the answering machine. \nANSWERING MACHINE (male voice) Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter. Just wondered why you didn't hand in your essay this afternoon. I was a bit concerned. Call me to schedule a make-up. \nBEEP. Thumper offers Evan a magnified frown of disapproval. \nANSWERING MACHINE (male voice) What did you say to my sister motherfucker?! Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour to me. (enraged breathing) She said you came and saw her last night. \nThumper coughs accidentally, tips the bong over on Evan's bed. Reacting quickly, he grabs a towel from under the door and wipes off Evan's comforter. \nANSWERING MACHINE (Tommy; cont'd) She... she fucking killed herself tonight. She's dead. (beat) And so are you. \nMR. MILLER (hoarse whisper) Who -- who are you? \nEvan impatiently waves the question. \nEVAN Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa? \nMR. MILLER (choking) ...yes. \nEVAN Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you. \nThe impact of the last sentence isn't lost on Mr. Miller. \nEVAN One last thing. \nEvan leans over to whisper in Kayleigh's ear. Kayleigh stares at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers. \nKayleigh looks into Evan's eyes for support. Evan nods go on. His confidence brings a boldness to her lips. \nKAYLEIGH Don't you ever touch me again. \nMR. MILLER I -- I won't. \nKayleigh summons her own new courage. \nKAYLEIGH I'm cold. And I'm putting on my clothes. \nAs he leaves to pick up her clothes, Evan grins. \nEVAN What you need to do is discipline your son Tommy, because the kid's one sadistic pup. \nHiding at the top of the basement stairs, Tommy recoils in horror and picks up one of his sister's dolls and begins twisting the head back and forth... \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. SORORITY BEDROOM - MORNING - 2002 \nA broad smile lines Evan's face as he slowly wakes up from his slumber. He suddenly grabs his head as if suffering from a pounding migraine. \nMONTAGE OF SWIRLING MEMORIES \nQuick cuts and flashes of Evan and Kayleigh growing older -- she seems more carefree now, full of life and less self- conscious. \nEXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - DAY - 1989 \nEvan pulls Kayleigh around in a little red wagon. \nINT. FAMILY RESTAURANT - DAY - 1989 \nEvan and Kayleigh play in a tub of balls in the playroom. \nEXT.

JUNKYARD - DAY - 1995 \nBurning sack in flames. \nEXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - STREET - 1995 \nQUICK FLASH of the U-Haul driving away. \nEXT. BUS STATION - DAY - 1995 \nAt thirteen, Kayleigh spunkily hops off a GREYHOUND BUS and runs into Evan's arms. \nEXT. ANDREA'S NEW HOUSE - DAY - 1995 \nStill thirteen, Evan peddles his bike by his new house, Kayleigh riding on the handlebars. \nMore memory flashes of Evan and Kayleigh throughout the teen years, they grow up as lovers now: \nEXT. LAKE - DAY - 1997 \nEvan and Kayleigh have romantic picnic on a rowboat. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - SUNRISE - 2002 \nEvan and Kayleigh watch the sunrise after senior prom. \nBACK TO: \nThumper eyes this strange preppy kid with distaste. \nTHUMPER Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex? \nEVAN Huh? \nTHUMPER Fuck off, frat boy. \nThumper walks away, leaving Evan dumbfounded. \nINT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY \nEvan runs into the lecture hall and gets in line behind other STUDENTS who are taking No. 2 pencils from a box on Professor Carter's desk. \nEvan hears PEOPLE he cannot see calling his name. Somehow, it's more creepy than cool. The Professor makes a loud announcement. \nPROFESSOR CARTER Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due. \nEVAN (quietly) I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension? \nPROFESSOR CARTER And you are...? \nEVAN (disappointed) Evan Treborn. \nPROFESSOR CARTER The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin. \nEvan walks up the aisle and takes a seat. As he sits down, someone puts his ARM menacingly around Evan's throat. \nEvan flinches, turns around and sees Hunter, the frat guy Thumper assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank's bar. \nEVAN Leave me alone, asshole. I didn't lay a hand on you, okay? \nHunter bursts out laughing. \nHUNTER Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this? \nEVAN (awkward) We'll find out soon enough. \nHUNTER (laughing) Me neither. \nHunter surreptitiously hands Evan a cheat-sheet to the exam. Evan's face brightens. \nEVAN You're kidding. Are these the answers?! \nHUNTER Damn, Evan, on the D.L. \nEVAN (holding it lower) Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers... \nHUNTER I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it. \nEvan nods and smiles as exams are passed down his row. \nINT. SORORITY BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEvan and Kayleigh have just finished having sex. She seems incredibly satisfied, but he looks slightly uncomfortable. \nKAYLEIGH Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks? \nEVAN So it didn't feel... weird? \nKAYLEIGH Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird. \nShe giggles and snuggles into him. He's grateful for her affection, but still looks uneasy. The PHONE RINGS and he automatically answers it. \nEVAN Yellow. \nSilence on the other end. More silence. \nKAYLEIGH Fuck 'em. \nAs Evan hangs up, he and Kayleigh share a giggle and he resumes snuggle position. \nEVAN What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away? \nKAYLEIGH (laughs) As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me? \nEvan smiles to himself. And hugs her tighter. \nEVAN You think we'll always be together? \nFor the first time she looks at him with concern. \nKAYLEIGH That is the plan, right? Hell or high water? \nHe's in heaven, but plays it cool. \nEVAN Just making sure. \nKAYLEIGH It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago. \nEVAN Might'a been nice. (re: pepper spray) Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun. \nKAYLEIGH Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me. \nEVAN (shaking the cannister) Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett. \nKAYLEIGH (quietly) It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids. \nEVAN Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine. \nKAYLEIGH (quietly) My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy. \nEvan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this. Kayleigh's eyes plead for him to have compassion. \nEVAN Fine, then. We'll let campus security deal with him. \nEXT. COLLEGE QUAD - NIGHT \nKayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus. Evan seems especially paranoid. In the distance, some guy vomits loudly. \nKAYLEIGH Are you okay? \nEVAN What do you mean? \nKAYLEIGH It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know? \nEVAN Like how? \nKAYLEIGH I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same. \nEVAN I walk differently? \nKAYLEIGH I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but... \nEVAN I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us. \nThe guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes. Kayleigh and Evan instinctively avert their eyes. Suddenly, Kayleigh's ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride. \nKAYLEIGH Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket? \nEVAN What? \nThe guy, wearing Evan's brown suede jacket, suddenly springs to his feet, revealing his face for the first time. \nKAYLEIGH Tommy. \nTommy has grown in the last seven years. He has long, greasy hair and some tattoos. He holds a TIRE THUMPER (a short, steel bat for truckers) menacingly in his right hand. \nEvan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat pockets. \nEVAN Leave us alone you sick fuck! \nTOMMY Get this \"us\" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself. \nKAYLEIGH Shut up, Tommy! \nTOMMY Aw, hey now, that was a compliment. \nTommy takes a few practice swings with the tire thumper. \nEVAN What the hell are you doing? \nTOMMY It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit. \nEVAN (suppressing panic) No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy. \nTOMMY Right, Evan. I believe you just said \"sick fuck.\" \nTommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in the shoulder and ribs. \nEvan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face. \nTommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray. Kayleigh screams. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly swinging the tire thumper. Evan charges forward in an uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of Tommy's hands and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into Tommy's open mouth. \nKAYLEIGH Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him! \nEVAN He's a fucking maniac! \nEvan knocks Tommy down with the tire thumper. Kayleigh screams and tries to hold Evan back, but he easily wrestles free of her. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad. \nEVAN He ruined Lenny's life -- \nEvan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs. Kayleigh pushes a button on the \"Blue Light\" lamp post and an ALARM WAILS. \nEVAN He killed Crockett -- (kicks him) Murdered that woman and her baby! (kicks again) And he's trying to kill me, Kayleigh! He's trying to fucking kill me! \nAnother Neo-Nazi, RICK, swats Evan's journals out of his hands and onto the floor. Life springs back into Evan as he rushes for the journals. He and Rick grab the journals at the same time. A minor tug of war. \nEVAN Let go! They're mine! \nRick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn pages. Evan sees the damage and goes mental. \nEVAN Motherfucker! \nEvan swings at Rick and misses. INMATES CHEER! It's on! Rick lunges for Evan, a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the journals getting trampled. Suddenly -- The sounds of COCKED RIFLES echo through the air. The fight stops instantly as Rick and Evan look up to see -- \nANGLE ON \nOFFICER STATION. Officers aim rifles at the pair. From an upper tier, even more officers with more rifles. \nTheir barrels sight directly at Evan. Rick steps away, quick to maliciously scoop up Evan's torn journals. \nKARL We'll be comin' for you tonight, sister. \nEvan catches his breath, then looks at the remaining few pages on the floor. \nINT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY \nEvan enters the cell with a few entry pages. He looks through them. Nothing there. \nEvan nods depressed, then sees the page from his \"Age 7\" journal, grabs Carlos' duct tape and tapes the page over his bed. \nINT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY \nEvan, walking toward some White Supremacists, flinches whenever the occasional INMATE brushes against him. Evan is completely paranoid, waiting for an inevitable attack. Karl makes himself visible among them, holding a journal. He reads: \nKARL (from Evan's journal) Today I found my grandfather's death certificate. He died in a nut house, just like my father. Mom denies it, but she thinks I'm gonna end up the same way... \nThe other Supremacists start laughing and calling \"looney\" and \"nut job.\" Evan rushes past them and they make chicken clucks at him. \nEXT. PRISON YARD - DAY \nEvan and Carlos sit on BLEACHERS that overlook the other prisoners working out. \nEvan closely watches Karl and Rick who stare daggers at him from across the yard. A SKINHEAD PASSES SOMETHING with a white-taped handle to Karl but no officers seem to notice. \nEvan slides closer to Carlos and stares at the Jesus Christ tattoos all over Carlos' back. \nEVAN You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about \"the Lord works in mysterious ways?\" \nCARLOS Straight up. \nEVAN Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me. \nCARLOS Shit. I knew you were crazy. \nEVAN I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams. \nCarlos scoffs whatever. \nEVAN Pack of smokes says I can prove it to you. \nCarlos is suddenly interested. \nINT. EVAN'S CELL - LATER \nEvan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes up a conversation. \nCarlos looks dumbfounded. \nEVAN So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely. \nCARLOS You need to see the prison shrink, man. \nTheir conversation stops when a convict rolls a mail cart by, Evan looking up expectantly. \nEVAN Anything today? \nCONVICT Yep. Just not for you. \nDisappointed, Evan turns back to Carlos. Holds up his journal entry. \nEVAN Just tell me if anything weird happens. \nCARLOS Weirder than this? \nEVAN Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess. \nEvan studies the page. \nJOURNAL ENTRY \n\"On Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing that I didn't do. Mommy wont let me see it.\" \nStill nothing. Not even a glance in his direction. Evan sighs and gives up. \nEVAN Okay, Lenny. Just wanted to say \"hi\". \nEvan turns around to leave. \nLENNY You knew the whole time, didn't you? (Evan spins around) When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?! \nEVAN (jaw dropped) Y... yes. I guess I did. \nLenny's eyes seethe with hate. \nLENNY Then you should be where I am. You should be where I am. \nEvan backs away, face guilt-stricken. \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY \nEvan enters his dormroom (where everything's backwards), reaches under his bed and is relieved to find the journal marked \"AGE 7\". \nEXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY \nEvan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale. \nJOURNAL ENTRY \n\"Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason and he is crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad.\" \nEvan takes a calming breath and begins reading. \nEVAN (as if reciting a mantra) Today I get to meet my father. His name is Jason and he is crazy... \nEvan gets some strange looks, but continues. As he does, the trees and frisbee-playing students behind him VIBRATE and SHUDDER. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. SUNNYVALE VISITOR'S CHAMBER - DAY - 1989 \nSeven-year old Evan comes to during the time he first met his father, Jason. \nJason waits patiently for young Evan to finish his sentence. \nJASON Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there. \nEVAN Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done. \nJason is completely thrown. \nJASON I was praying this curse would have ended with me. \nEVAN But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me. \nJASON (frustrated) There is no \"right\". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were. \nEVAN Who's to say you can't make things better? \nJason seems extremely upset to hear Evan say this. \nJASON You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother. \nEVAN Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again. \nJason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, and grabs hold of Evan's throat. \nEVAN'S POV \nAs Jason looks down at us, frothing at the mouth, there's a trick of the light where Jason's head seems to VIBRATE against the ceiling. \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY - 2002 \nEvan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he realizes his surroundings. Heartbroken, he shuts the journal and stands up shakily. \nINT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - EARLY EVENING \nEvan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work. As he eats, his arm sits in front of his plate, protectively. Guarding his food. \nWAITRESS Just get out, didja? \nEVAN Huh? \nWAITRESS (re: his arm) Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that. \nEVAN (defensively) I come from a big family. \nEVAN Yeah? \nKAYLEIGH On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch. \nEVAN Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts? \nEvan continues and Kayleigh listens with a mixture of intense interest and matched skepticism. \nDISSOLVE TO LATER: \nINT. DINER - NIGHT \nKayleigh finishes a plateful of food at a busy diner. She lights up an after-dinner smoke. \nKAYLEIGH You're right, Evan, I don't believe you. \nEVAN I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again. \nKAYLEIGH I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit? \nEVAN I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you. \nKAYLEIGH Oh? There's proof now? \nEVAN (tired) Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh? \nKAYLEIGH Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that. \nEVAN Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister. \nKayleigh's jaw drops. \nEVAN Oh! And when you orgasm, your toes go numb. I'm sure your clientele aren't privy to that one. \nKayleigh tries to conceal the surprise in her eyes. \nEVAN I just thought you should know. \nKAYLEIGH Know what? \nEVAN That I didn't leave you there to rot. \nKayleigh flinches as if her should had been invaded, then her eyes fill with distrust and contempt. \nKAYLEIGH There's one major hole in your story. \nEVAN Which is? \nKAYLEIGH There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority. \nShe opens Evan's wallet and leaves a twenty on the table. \nKAYLEIGH Sure you don't want your wallet? \nEVAN Don't think I'll need it where I'm going. \nKAYLEIGH Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act. \nEVAN I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit. \nKAYLEIGH Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family. \nShe gets up and puts on her coat. \nKAYLEIGH Oh, here's one! Go back when I'm seven and fuck me in front of Daddy's handicam, you know, straighten me out a bit... \nShe tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves. \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY \nEvan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex with another naked GOTHIC CO- ED. On Evan's bed. \nEVAN Get out. Both of you. \nTHUMPER Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all. \nEvan's temper flares and he picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a wall above Thumper's head. \nEVAN I'm not saying it again. \nThumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave. Alone in the room, Evan looks under his bed and breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are intact. He sifts through them again. He finally finds the passage he needs. Something catches the corner of Evan's eyes and he turns to examine it. \nTo the left of Thumper's Buddha statuette sits a large VOTIVE CANDLE that bears a portrait of Jesus Christ. \nEVAN (humble) Lord give me the strength and guidance I need to set things right. \nAs he begins reading a passage to himself, SOUNDS ECHO backward at us from another time and place. And the entire ROOM SHIMMERS around him -- \nEvan moans and tries to rub his temple with his stump. \nEVAN Where are we going? \nKAYLEIGH We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages. \nEVAN Stop! Take me back! \nLENNY Sorry, tough guy, no can do. Your mother would kill me. \nEvan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of the wheelchair. Lenny must halt in order not to crush Evan. As Evan writhes about on the floor, his legs paralyzed, a CROWD GATHERS. \nEvan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd that titters and snickers in the background. \nEVAN Take me back, Lenny! (teeth clenched) You owe me that much. \nKayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd. \nKAYLEIGH What are you geeks looking at? Must be nice to be so goddamned perfect, huh? Fucking losers. \nThe crowd breaks up and leaves. \nEXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY \nIt's calm now. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair around the quad. Evan now wears prosthetic arms. Random PEOPLE call out to Lenny. He's extremely popular in this world. \nLENNY 'Sup, Sheila! We missed you at the party! Don't even think I'm giving you my lab notes either! Think I like getting up for \"eight thirty's\"? \nLenny pushes Evan past Thumper and Cricket. Their conversation stops and they stare at their feet as Evan gets wheeled by. Evan boils to be treated as if he were non-existent. \nLENNY Hey, there's Tommy. \nEvan spins around in fear. He sees Tommy, clean-cut, and handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads \"Campus Crusade for Christ.\" Tommy seems good-natured now, working hard and soliciting names for his list. He looks up as Evan rolls along and his eyes brighten to see Evan. \nTOMMY I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance. \nEVAN Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke. \nTommy frowns and exchanges glances with Lenny, who shrugs and nods back to him. \nLENNY Uh, we should be getting to class now. \nEVAN Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh. \nAnother exchanged glance. Kayleigh looks at Evan. \nKAYLEIGH Let's go for a stroll. \nEvan allows Kayleigh to roll him away from the others. To the very spot where Evan once killed Tommy. \nEvan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can \"magically\" will to open, close, open, close... \nEVAN So Tommy's really into this Jesus kick, huh? \nKayleigh looks at him curiously. \nKAYLEIGH You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie. \nEVAN He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck. \nKayleigh, now by a bench. Stops and sits. As she casually uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a granola bar and hands it to him. \nHis prosthetic hand crushes it. It crumbles to dust. She seems more confused. \nKAYLEIGH Is something the matter? \nEVAN (re: prosthetic arms) Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something. \nShe leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar. \nEVAN Kayleigh? Do you ever think about \"us?\" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us? \nKAYLEIGH Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about. \nEVAN I was? \nKAYLEIGH That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother. \nEVAN I don't get it. \nKAYLEIGH (feeding another bite) When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again. \nEVAN I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together? \nKAYLEIGH It's crossed my mind from time to time. \nEVAN (hopeful) And...? \nEVAN Mom. Don't cry. I can change this. \nTOMMY I think I'll go check out the chapel. \nANDREA You're. Acting. Like your father. \nEVAN Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts. \nAndrea is shocked. \nANDREA How. Did you. Know that? \nEVAN You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you. \nShe uses her left hand to pinch off the air to her oxygen tube and forces herself to speak in a sick, GRAVELY manner. \nANDREA Just. Like. Jason. \nEVAN Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here. \nHe pushes a lever and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself out of the room. \nAndrea forces her loudest raspy scream. \nANDREA Stop him. Stop him. Stop him... \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT \nLenny tears through old cardboard boxes in Evan's closet. Evan watches nearby. \nLENNY Are you sure you even packed it? \nEVAN My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see. \nEvan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk on the floor. Old report cards, books, toys and photo albums fall on the floor. \nLENNY Is this it? \nEvan beams when he sees Lenny holding his old journal. AGE \nLENNY What do you need it for? I don't get you lately. \nEVAN Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. \nLENNY What? \nEVAN Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it. \nLENNY (concerned) Destroy it? \nEVAN If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh. \nLenny, utterly baffled, sits back in silence and watches Evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat. \nON EVAN \nAs new sounds ECHO BACKWARD. There's a -- \nSHIMMER! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING - 1989 \nEvan comes to in his childhood kitchen. He is only seven years old. He coughs up Lucky Charms that have \"magically\" appeared in his mouth. On a journal before him is the recently written passage: \nJOURNAL ENTRY \n\"Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy. I will mete there father and see what a real dad is like.\" \nAndrea is nowhere in sight. Evan springs to his feet and flexes his real hands triumphantly. \nEVAN Yes. Now how do I destroy the blockbuster? \nHe rummages through the utensil drawer and pulls out a large butcher knife and grabs it. He tucks it into his sock but it won't fit. He's still debating what to do when: \nANDREA WALKS IN and is startled by the unexpected sight of Evan holding a huge knife. \nEvan sees her but remains expressionless. Andrea's face blanches. \nANDREA Evan? What are you doing with that knife? \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002 \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. EVAN'S ROOM - SUNNYVALE - DAY - 2002 \nEvan lies in a room, same posters from college adorn the walls. Blood flows freely now. \nEVAN (sobbing uncontrollably) Kayleigh... no! You can't die again! I won't let this happen. I won't! \nEvan fights off the pain and looks under his bed for something. \nEVAN Where are they?! \nHis journals are missing! He runs from the room. \nINT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFCIE - DAY \nEvan runs into Dr. Redfield's office just as another patient is leaving. \nDR. REDFIELD Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour. \nEVAN Where are my goddamn books? \nDR. REDFIELD Books? \nEVAN My journals! Where are they? \nThe doctor looks heartbroken, as if Evan has had a relapse. \nDR. REDFIELD It kills me to have to go through this again. There are no journals. There never were. It's part of this fantasy world your mind created to cope with the guilt of killing... \nEvan looks stunned. Refusing to believe it. \nDR. REDFIELD Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia... \nEVAN But I... I need those books. \nDR. REDFIELD You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one. \nEVAN Photos? \nEvan's eyes roll back and he collapses lifelessly to the floor. \nINT. SUNNYVALE LABORATORY - DAY \nEvan lies on a platform and gets another series of CAT-scans. \nINT. EVAN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nEvan, no longer incapacitated, stares out the window into the darkness. Alone. \nTrapped. Hopeless. \nINT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - DAY \nLater that day, Dr. Redfield posts the new CAT-scan slides on the light box and shudders when he sees the results. Andrea looks on anxiously. \nDR. REDFIELD Jesus, no. \nAndrea, biting her nails, is unable to conceal her fear. \nANDREA No dances, just tell me. \nDR. REDFIELD (devastated) The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions. \nAndrea begins to break down in tears. Evan secretly listens in from the hallway. \nHis gaunt face looks deep in thought. He takes a breath and enters the lab, making sure not to look directly at his weeping mother. \nEVAN Hey, Mom, didja remember to bring those goofy old home movies we used to make? \nAndrea wipes tears away, nodding in advance. \nINT. DR. REDFIELD'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nEvan sees no one is watching him in the institution corridor as he throws his weight into the door of the doctor's office, breaking it open. \nSporadically, severe VIBRATIONS invade Evan's environment, threatening to distract him from his mission. \nINT.

SUNNYVALE - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT - 2002 \nEVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office. His face and chest are covered in blood. He holds his forehead in pain. \nFLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him. ALARMS SOUND. GUARDS are heard shouting to each other. Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's desk. He grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand. \nEVAN (as he writes) If anyone finds this, then I guess my plan didn't work and I'm already dead... \nHe takes a deep breath. \nEVAN But if I can just go back to the beginning of all this, I still might be able to save her. \nFatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing... \nINT.

Evan, now 5, is gently prodded by Andrea toward KAYLEIGH, 5, a quiet sweet-looking girl with beautiful hair. \nEvan clumsily shakes her hand and she quickly leans over and kisses his cheek. \nHe blushes and runs to hug his mother's leg. \nEND MONTAGE & TITLES. \nEXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - 1989 \nIn the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky cocker spaniel puppy. \nAndrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he watches his mother work. \nANDREA Okay, okay... what now? \nEvan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16\" wrench from the toolbox. \nEVAN We're gonna be late again. \nANDREA When did you ever care about getting to school on time? \nEVAN We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night. \nEvan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt. \nEVAN Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy. \nANDREA Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time. \nThe carburetor will not set properly. She bangs on it with the wrench. \nANDREA (re: carb) Darn it! \nEVAN Um... can dad come this time? \nANDREA (getting impatient) You know the answer to that. \nEVAN Can't he come out for one day? \nANDREA We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him. \nEVAN But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad... \n", "test1_true": "ANDREA Here, Ev... Finish this up for me. \nEvan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb back together. \nAndrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a spotless nurse's uniform underneath. \nEVAN All the dads are gonna be there. \nANDREA I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I? \nEVAN No. \nANDREA Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there. \nEvan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea. \nEVAN (beat) Done. Try it. \nAndrea gets behind the wheel. She turns the ignition and the engine roars to life. Evan wears a proud smile. \nANDREA You're amazing, kiddo. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING - 1989 \nAndrea races through the school zone and heads for the main doors. Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on the ground by the time the car skids to a halt. Andrea checks her watch. \nANDREA Okay have a great day I love you I'll pick you up later gotta go... \nEvan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window. \nMRS. BOSWELL Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you! \nANDREA I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work -- \nMrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea. \nMRS. BOSWELL I think you really need to see this. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe classroom is filled with screaming, running children. Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid. \nMRS. BOSWELL TOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKE ME SEND YOU TO MR. VOYTEK'S OFFICE! \nEvan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet-looking girl. \nMrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk. \nMRS. BOSWELL I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first. \nANDREA What is it? \nMRS. BOSWELL Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this... \nMrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it. \nANDREA I don't understand... Evan did this? \nThe drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies. It's extremely sophisticated for a seven-year old. Some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct. \nAndrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern. \nANDREA Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture? \nMRS. BOSWELL Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it... \nANDREA What? \nMRS. BOSWELL When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it. \nAndrea is visibly shaken now. \nANDREA I have to go. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER \nAndrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot even start the car. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER \nThe children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's Night. Each child has a picture of his or her family made from colored construction paper and macaroni. Evan's picture (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and himself on a green hill. Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each show two kids and a single father. And their 'mother' is stuck to the far end of page. \nLenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear family. He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused. \nLENNY You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it. \nTOMMY You're such a retard! \n", "test1_id": 654, "test2_input": "On \"mailbox\", Tommy suddenly grabs Evan's jacket and SHOVES him against a parked car. Tommy looks around to make sure nobody heard anything. \nTOMMY Don't ever bring that shit up again. Not ever. Not to me, not to Kayleigh, or even Lenny. The stupid fuck if he ever learns to talk again. Understand? \nEvan nods, scared. Tommy gives a final shove. \nTOMMY Ever. (re: Kayleigh) She don't want to talk about it, anyway. Do you Kayleigh? \nTommy's right. Kayleigh clearly doesn't. \nINT. MULTIPLEX THEATER LOBBY - DUSK \nKayleigh shuffles behind Evan and Tommy as they head toward the theatre. Evan drops back. \nEVAN Are you okay? \nKayleigh says nothing as Tommy sees the theatre playing SEVEN and whispers. \nTOMMY There it is. Let's go. \nINT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nAndrea does the dishes as the TV plays a NEWSCAST in the b.g. \nANCHOR (on TV) ...was the grizzly aftermath of what police officials of upstate New York are calling a horrible act of vandalism gone awry. \nAndrea turns to the TV, blocking our view. We can only hear the report as she watches intensely. \nANCHOR The powerful explosion is believed to have been caused by a small quantity of dynamite. \nAndrea's face looks haunted by the on-screen images. She shakes her head in terror and grabs the remote. \nANCHOR Police thus far have no leads as to the suspects... \nShe clicks off the TV, trembling. \nINT. MULTIPLEX THEATER - NIGHT \nThe movie's in progress. Evan and Kayleigh sit behind Tommy. \nTOMMY Holy shit! Look at that fat fuck! You'd have to wipe his ass with a forklift! \nSome crowd members TURN around and give Tommy a SHUSH. Tommy whips M&Ms at them. \nTOMMY Shut up, faggot. No one's talking to you! \nKayleigh, repulsed, suddenly darts from the aisle and runs out. Evan follows. \nINT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nEvan follows her to a small alcove. \nEVAN I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea. \nKAYLEIGH You really don't remember anything that happened? \nEvan shakes his head \"no\". She looks devastated. \nKAYLEIGH You're so lucky. \nShe begins to cry. Evan makes sure no one's staring. \nEVAN It's going to be okay. Lenny'll be fine. You'll see. \nHe reaches to comfort her. But she winces. \nKAYLEIGH Ouch. \nEVAN I'm sorry. \nShe pulls her sleeve up, revealing a large bruise. \nKAYLEIGH It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny. \nEVAN Damn. Your dad did this? \nKayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger, darker bruise. \nKAYLEIGH (looking down) I deserve a lot worse. \nEVAN What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit. \nShe looks into his eyes. \nEVAN You really have no clue how beautiful you are, do you? \nShe searches his eyes for sincerity. And finds it. They lean into each other for a TENDER KISS. After a moment, a ROAR from nearby. \n", "test2_true": "They jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring at them from across a small crowd. By now, some teens chuckle at Tommy. \nTEEN PUNK (O.S.) Buying popcorn, what the fuck are you doing? \nTommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan. His hands in fists. Suddenly a FOOT reaches out and trips Tommy. Tommy falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him. \nTommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with Evan. Hatred oozing. \nEvan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what you're thinking. \nTommy suddenly lunges at the TEEN PUNK who must be at least a foot taller than he is. Tommy lands a flurry of punches before the Teen Punk can even defend himself, frequently taking opportunities to eyeball Evan. \nEvan, Kayleigh and even the punk's FRIENDS look on helplessly when TWO SECURITY GUARDS SEIZE TOMMY. Tommy valiantly struggles against them at first. But the moment he realizes it's hopeless, he allows his body to go slack. \nAs Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan, a sick smile on his face.  Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless. \nINT. ANDREA'S CAR - NIGHT \nAndrea drives through the winding roads. \nCLOSE UP \nAndrea's eyes. Tormented. \nREVEAL she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan's up front and Kayleigh sits behind them. Everyone silent. \nAndrea stares through the rearview mirror into Kayleigh's eyes. Probing. Searching. \nANDREA So how was the movie? \nKAYLEIGH Okay. \nAndrea watches Kayleigh. A calculated beat. \nANDREA Any exploding mailboxes? \nKayleigh flinches at the question. And Andrea catches it. Evan can't help but look back at Kayleigh. Oh my god, she knows. \nKAYLEIGH (faking poorly) What do you mean? \nAndrea pulls the car over and stops. After a moment, Kayleigh realizes she's at her house. She exits the car in a hurry. \nANDREA Goodnight. \nAndrea stares at Evan, who keeps his eyes facing dead ahead. She finally shifts the car into gear. \nANDREA We're moving. \nEvan says nothing. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - MORNING \nA \"For Sale\" sign is now planted on the front lawn. Andrea, in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car. \nINT. ANDREA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEvan discreetly watches her leave through the window. Grabs his coat and exits frame. \nEXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY \nKayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house. \nEVAN I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right? \nKAYLEIGH He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore. \nEVAN Duck, here they come. \nAs a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh duck in nearby bushes. \nKAYLEIGH Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay? \nEVAN He must be. They're letting him go, right? \nThe station wagon finally heads into the driveway. Evan puts on a smile and charges the car, pounding the window. \nEVAN Welcome home, Lenny! \nInside the car, Lenny jerks back in horror. Mrs. Kagan looks angry as she rolls the window down. \nMRS. KAGAN I think your little homecoming's in bad taste. \nThe smile fades from Evan's face. Kayleigh hangs back. \nEVAN Sorry? \n", "test2_id": 655, "test3_input": "WORDS from the entry begin to SHIMMER. REVERBERANT SOUNDS OF BARKING break the sound barrier and the image of Aryans storming the cell behind him become a FRENETIC BLUR \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. JUNKYARD WOODS - DAY - 1995 \nEvan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods. Evan stumbles at first, then rights himself. He seems strangely exhilarated. A sinister victory smile. \nEVAN Rot in hell you fucking animals. \nKayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take. Evan shrugs \"just kidding\" and looks around, getting his bearings. He whips his hand out and stops them. \nEVAN Wait. Before we -- \nHe suddenly notices Kayleigh who now no longer looks an awkward and unkempt tomboy, but rather a vibrant and feminine young girl. Whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering before, she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles. Evan remembers his mission and darts over to a JUNK PILE. \nEVAN We need something to cut open the sack! \nKayleigh and Lenny stare at him, concerned for his sanity. \nEvan roots through the trash until he finds something: a razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long. Evan offers it to Lenny. \nEVAN I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby -- \nKAYLEIGH Evan. Stop it. It's not the time. \nEVAN (frantic) Now's the only time! (to Lenny) Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa -- \nLENNY What are you talking about? \nKAYLEIGH You're acting crazy! \nEVAN (desperate; to Lenny) Please. If you've ever trusted me before, trust me on this one. \nEvan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand. \nEVAN Cut the rope. \nLenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away. \nEXT. JUNKYARD - LATER \nEvan groans on the ground, writhing. Tommy's voice hitches, eyes watering from pent up frustration. \nTOMMY Listen to me good, Evan... \nEVAN I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father. \nEvan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates. A look of understanding passes between them. Gratitude, even. \nTommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it. Lenny comes screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell! With all of the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way through Tommy's throat! \nTommy clutches his throat, gagging in blood. Evan surveys the scene in shock: \nEVAN Oh fuck, Lenny, no! \nLenny drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in his hands and freezes up completely. Kayleigh wakes up and SCREAMS when she sees blood spurt from Tommy's throat. \nMeanwhile, Crockett escapes from the sack. \nEVAN'S POV \nLenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as if operating a jack-hammer. \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. COLLEGE - EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002 \nEvan comes to in a familiar place. His original college dorm - ONLY BACKWARDS. \nEVAN Christ. Help me. \nHe sits upright in bed and takes in his surroundings. When suddenly, Evan clutches his head in severe pain. \nA MONTAGE OF IMAGES ASSAULT HIM: \nINT. SORORITY BEDROOM - DAY \nColor memories of Kayleigh's sorority fade to BLACK and WHITE and dissipate. \nEXT.

EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002 \nEvan's eyes roll back in his head. He shakes uncontrollably and blood pours from his nose. \nThumper opens the door, sees Evan convulsing and jumps back in horror. He scans the hallways for assistance. \nTHUMPER Someone call 9-1-1! \nINT. SUNNYVALE LABORATORY - DAY \nEvan lies on an examining table undergoing another series of CAT-scans. The machines are now state of the art and the lab room has been redecorated. \nINT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - DAY \nAndrea nervously chews her fingernails as she watches Dr. Redfield post CAT-scan results on the light box. A young nurse pushes Evan, in a wheelchair, into the doctor's office. \nEVAN Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got? \nANDREA Cute, Evan. \nDR. REDFIELD It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before. \nEVAN Are you sure? Not even with my father? \nDr. Redfield and Andrea exchange looks. \nDR. REDFIELD Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago. \nANDREA So what did you find. \nDr. Redfield points to the CAT-scan slides, specifically, to the outer lining of Evan's brain. \nDR. REDFIELD This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex. \nEVAN (nonplussed) Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored? \nDr. Redfield stares ahead. Transfixed by the slides. \nDR. REDFIELD I've never seen anything like this. I've compared these to the ones taken last year, and there's evidence of severe hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction. \nAndrea stares at him blankly. Evan impatiently \"pops wheelies\" in the wheel chair. \nANDREA What does that mean for Evan? \nEVAN (to Andrea) He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc? \nDr. Redfield nods, awed by Evan's effortless interpretation. Evan springs out of the wheelchair and stretches his legs. \nEVAN (to Andrea) Mind if I wait in the car? The lighting here bugs my eyes. \nAndrea nods. Evan shakes Dr. Redfield's hand. \nEVAN Well, it's nice seeing you again. But you know, people to see, things to read... \nAndrea shoots Dr. Redfield an apologetic look. Evan heads out the door, accidentally knocking Dr. Redfield's jacket to the floor. He shrugs apologetically and re-hangs it. \nINT. SUNNYVALE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nOutside the office, Evan inspects Dr. Redfield's KEYS and attached SECURITY CARD and smiles. Evan covertly winds himself through the maze of corridors, careful not to be seen by the staff. \nHe finally sees a wing marked \"CRIMINALLY INSANE\". Evan looks around to make certain he's not being watched, then uses the security card to open the door. He looks in every room of the wing until he finds -- \nINT. SUNNYVALE - LENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEvan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees. \nLenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in tight leather restraints. The dark five o'clock shadow and his malicious grin radiate evil. \nHis black and haunting eyes personify hate and murderous intent. \nLenny seems neither surprised or happy to see Evan. That is, if he's aware of Evan's presence at all... \nEVAN Is there anything you need? Anything I can get you? \nNothing from Lenny. \nEVAN What about the models, man? Bet I can get you a shitload of models up in here. \n", "test3_id": 656}

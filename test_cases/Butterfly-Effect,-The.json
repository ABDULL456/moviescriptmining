SUNNYVALE - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT - 2002 \nEVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office. His face and chest are covered in blood. He holds his forehead in pain. \nFLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him. ALARMS SOUND. GUARDS are heard shouting to each other. Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's desk. He grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand. \nEVAN (as he writes) If anyone finds this, then I guess my plan didn't work and I'm already dead... \nHe takes a deep breath. \nEVAN But if I can just go back to the beginning of all this, I still might be able to save her. \nFatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing... \nINT.

ANDREA'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - 1989 \nIn the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky cocker spaniel puppy. \nAndrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he watches his mother work. \nANDREA Okay, okay... what now? \nEvan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16\" wrench from the toolbox. \nEVAN We're gonna be late again. \nANDREA When did you ever care about getting to school on time? \nEVAN We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night. \nEvan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt. \nEVAN Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy. \nANDREA Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time. \nThe carburetor will not set properly. She bangs on it with the wrench. \nANDREA (re: carb) Darn it! \nEVAN Um... can dad come this time? \nANDREA (getting impatient) You know the answer to that. \nEVAN Can't he come out for one day? \nANDREA We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him. \nEVAN But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad... \n", "test1_true": "ANDREA Here, Ev... Finish this up for me. \nEvan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb back together. \nAndrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a spotless nurse's uniform underneath. \nEVAN All the dads are gonna be there. \nANDREA I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I? \nEVAN No. \nANDREA Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there. \nEvan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea. \nEVAN (beat) Done. Try it. \nAndrea gets behind the wheel. She turns the ignition and the engine roars to life. Evan wears a proud smile. \nANDREA You're amazing, kiddo. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING - 1989 \nAndrea races through the school zone and heads for the main doors. Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on the ground by the time the car skids to a halt. Andrea checks her watch. \nANDREA Okay have a great day I love you I'll pick you up later gotta go... \nEvan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window. \nMRS. BOSWELL Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you! \nANDREA I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work -- \nMrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea. \nMRS. BOSWELL I think you really need to see this. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe classroom is filled with screaming, running children. Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid. \nMRS. BOSWELL TOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKE ME SEND YOU TO MR. VOYTEK'S OFFICE! \nEvan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet-looking girl. \nMrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk. \nMRS. BOSWELL I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first. \nANDREA What is it? \nMRS. BOSWELL Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this... \nMrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it. \nANDREA I don't understand... Evan did this? \nThe drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies. It's extremely sophisticated for a seven-year old. Some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct. \nAndrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern. \nANDREA Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture? \nMRS. BOSWELL Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it... \nANDREA What? \nMRS. BOSWELL When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it. \nAndrea is visibly shaken now. \nANDREA I have to go. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER \nAndrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot even start the car. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER \nThe children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's Night. Each child has a picture of his or her family made from colored construction paper and macaroni. Evan's picture (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and himself on a green hill. Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each show two kids and a single father. And their 'mother' is stuck to the far end of page. \nLenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear family. He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused. \nLENNY You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it. \nTOMMY You're such a retard! \n", "test1_id": 654, "test2_input": "TOMMY C'mon! Run!! \nEvan and Kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run a few steps when they realize that Lenny isn't with them. \nTOMMY Lenny? Come on! \nKAYLEIGH Oh my God oh my God... \nLenny doesn't seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson road. Evan and Tommy double back and grab him. They try to make him break out into a run, but Lenny's feet drag limply against the ground. Both Tommy and Evan grab an arm and begin to run with Lenny through the woods. \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT \nEvan comes to. Lurches his body over the bed and vomits. \nSounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room. Looking sick and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a NEW SCAR from the cigarette burn. \nEVAN What the hell? \nIn the next bed, Thumper's head, wrapped in a blanket, pops up from above a NAKED GESELA'S waist. \nTHUMPER Christ, man. You wanna clean that up before I lose my appetite here? \nEvan sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins of the journal. \nINT. DORM LOBBY - DAY \nThe lobby is decorated with colorful streamers, balloons, posters and banners announcing PARENTS' WEEKEND. \nCarefree STUDENTS and their parents carry shopping bags toward the bustling elevators. Evan leans against the side of a pay phone, holding his ear to drawn out the noise. \nEVAN Yes, hello, uh, Mrs. Kagan, this is Evan Treborn. (rolling eyes) I know. I'm sorry about that. But I really need to speak with him. \nShe's obviously hung up on him. Suddenly, a HAND grabs his shoulder. It's PROFESSOR CARTER. \nPROFESSOR CARTER Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming. \nEVAN Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't... \nPROFESSOR CARTER I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right? \nEvan shrugs and forces a smile. \nPROFESSOR CARTER Just don't drop the ball, okay? \nEVAN I won't let you down, Professor Carter. \nCarter waves to another student and her parents and walks away. \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA waiter clears the dishes away from Evan and Andrea's table. \nREVEAL ANDREA \nHer hair now has gray streaks. As she signs for the bill, she leans over and kisses Evan on the cheek. \nEVAN Please, mom. People will talk. \nANDREA I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes. \nEVAN Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades? \nANDREA (smiling) Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him. \nEVAN Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time? \nAndrea's smile fades. \nANDREA Why do you ask? \nEVAN No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten. \nANDREA When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past. \nEvan tries not to react. \nANDREA I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them... \nEVAN Sure... \nANDREA And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could... \nEVAN What? What could he do? \n", "test2_true": "ANDREA Forget it. It's nothing. He was far too sick by then. \nEvan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface. \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT \nEvan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room looking for a certain book. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly watches Evan with growing concern. \nEVAN (reading aloud) I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off -- \nTHUMPER What the fuck are you doing? \nEVAN Shhh! I need quiet for this. \nThumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away. \nTHUMPER Are you stupid or what? \nEVAN What? \nTHUMPER Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit! \nThumper begins scanning the journal entry. A bitter laugh. \nTHUMPER Yeah, man. I'd think twice about this. You could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now. \nHe hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins reading it silently. \nHis hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat. \nINT. EVAN'S CAR - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nEvan, looking haggard and frail, wipes the greasy hair from his eyes and punches the accelerator. His teeth are clenched and he hammers his fist on the dashboard. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - EVENING \nEvan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. He eyes a piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out. \nINT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - CONTINUOUS \nA run-down greasy spoon. Filled with a number of TOWNIES and TRUCKERS. The place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears decorated in grime motif. \nEvan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food. \nKayleigh, now twenty, looks pale and sickly thin. She bangs her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to the floor. Her BOSS stares back in aggravation. \nBOSS Can we get through one goddamned day without you breaking something? \nKayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order. She is humiliated and Evan leans back against a pay phone so that she can't see him watching her. \nAs she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a CUSTOMER pinches her ass. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer. Evan backs out uncomfortably. \nEXT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - NIGHT \nKayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged. \nKAYLEIGH God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been? \nEVAN Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know... \nKAYLEIGH No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in. \nEVAN I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good... \nKayleigh nods and they walk down the street. She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes. \nEVAN (declining) Not since we were kids. \nKAYLEIGH I've stopped a hundred times. \nEVAN So how's Tommy? \nKAYLEIGH (takes a long drag) They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody. \nEvan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question. \nEVAN You still live with your dad? \nHer face is betrayed by a slight tick. \nKAYLEIGH No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen. \nEVAN Wow. That must've taken some courage. \nKAYLEIGH Not if you remember my dad. \n", "test2_id": 655, "test3_input": "EVAN Mom. Don't cry. I can change this. \nTOMMY I think I'll go check out the chapel. \nANDREA You're. Acting. Like your father. \nEVAN Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts. \nAndrea is shocked. \nANDREA How. Did you. Know that? \nEVAN You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you. \nShe uses her left hand to pinch off the air to her oxygen tube and forces herself to speak in a sick, GRAVELY manner. \nANDREA Just. Like. Jason. \nEVAN Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here. \nHe pushes a lever and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself out of the room. \nAndrea forces her loudest raspy scream. \nANDREA Stop him. Stop him. Stop him... \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT \nLenny tears through old cardboard boxes in Evan's closet. Evan watches nearby. \nLENNY Are you sure you even packed it? \nEVAN My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see. \nEvan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk on the floor. Old report cards, books, toys and photo albums fall on the floor. \nLENNY Is this it? \nEvan beams when he sees Lenny holding his old journal. AGE \nLENNY What do you need it for? I don't get you lately. \nEVAN Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. \nLENNY What? \nEVAN Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it. \nLENNY (concerned) Destroy it? \nEVAN If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh. \nLenny, utterly baffled, sits back in silence and watches Evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat. \nON EVAN \nAs new sounds ECHO BACKWARD. There's a -- \nSHIMMER! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING - 1989 \nEvan comes to in his childhood kitchen. He is only seven years old. He coughs up Lucky Charms that have \"magically\" appeared in his mouth. On a journal before him is the recently written passage: \nJOURNAL ENTRY \n\"Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy. I will mete there father and see what a real dad is like.\" \nAndrea is nowhere in sight. Evan springs to his feet and flexes his real hands triumphantly. \nEVAN Yes. Now how do I destroy the blockbuster? \nHe rummages through the utensil drawer and pulls out a large butcher knife and grabs it. He tucks it into his sock but it won't fit. He's still debating what to do when: \nANDREA WALKS IN and is startled by the unexpected sight of Evan holding a huge knife. \nEvan sees her but remains expressionless. Andrea's face blanches. \nANDREA Evan? What are you doing with that knife? \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002 \n", "test3_true": "EVAN Well, that didn't work... \nEvan flips a single page of his journal and tries again. He reads to himself, then relaxes his head -- \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. MILLER'S BASEMENT - DAY - 1989 \nEvan, seven again, stands in the basement dressed in his Robin Hood costume as Mr. Miller prepares for the sex scene. \nMR. MILLER Now in this part of the story, Robin Hood just married Maid Marian and they have to kiss and stuff like grown-ups do. \nKayleigh giggles. There seems to be a new glint of intelligence in Evan's eyes as he adjusts to his new surroundings. \nEVAN Wait! I need my belt! \nMr. Miller is puzzled, but watches Evan SKIP to the fireplace. \nEVAN (overly childlike) Loo loo, skip to my loo. Loo loo, skip to my loo. \nMr. Miller puts his eye back to the viewfinder as Evan quickly finds Mr. Miller's old army thermos in the bottom drawer of the dresser, opens it and shakes out the blockbuster. \nEVAN Loo, loo, skip to my loo. \nHe tries to crack it with his own hands, but his seven-year old body is too weak. \nMR. MILLER Hey kid, don't bother with the belt. \nMr. Miller finally turns around and sees Evan banging the blockbuster on the table. Shock registers in Mr. Miller's eyes and he takes a step towards Evan. \nEVAN Back off, fuckbag! \nMr. Miller freezes on that, and Evan smiles at him. \nEVAN Amazing. That word never fails to make an impression with you... \nMr. Miller takes a slow, non-threatening step toward Evan. \nMR. MILLER Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty. \nEVAN And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass! \nKayleigh's mouth hangs open with utter amazement at the scene. Tommy, hiding at the top of the stairs, slowly creeps down to get a better view. \nEvan rummages in the bureau and finds the wooden \"strike anywhere\" matches used at thirteen to light his cigarettes. \nMR. MILLER That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off! \nEVAN Been there, done that. \nEvan, standing near the fireplace, defiantly strikes the match with this thumb and lowers the flame to the short fuse. \nMr. Miller charges Evan just as the fuse is lit! Mr. Miller knocks the blockbuster from Evan's hand and it rolls towards the other side of the room, resting peacefully against the video camera. \nKayleigh's eyes are dazzled by the sparkling fuse and she bends down to pick it up -- \nMR. MILLER/TOMMY/EVAN Kayleigh! NOOOOOooooo! \nEXT. MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY - 1989 \nBOOM! The blast is deafening. \nFLASH! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT.

QUINCY It's okay, little baby. 
MONICA (struggling) Quit. 
Quincy grips her tighter, rocks her.  Students pass by, laugh. 
QUINCY Shhh.  Daddy's here. 
Monica finally cracks up. 
MONICA You're such a punk. 
He gives her a kiss. 
QUINCY All these girls...you're the only one I know who's for real. 
Monica smiles, kisses him back. 
MONICA Always. 
INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING 
A heated scrimmage between the women's "A" team (the starting five) and "B" team (five who want to be starting).  Monica runs point for the "B" team, playing opposite Sidra. 
Sidra is all over Monica, slipping in cheap shots, but Monica starts to come on.  She does a quick cross-over and loses Sidra.  She dishes off to Shayla, who scores. 
COACH MILLER Sidra!  You feel like playing any "D"? 
Sidra scowls as she runs down court.  She gets a pass in the corner, tires to make a move but Monica slaps the ball loose. 
Monica grabs it, drives to the three-point line, puts up the shot.  SWISH!  Monica stays posed, with her arm up. 
Sidra takes advantage, sprints back down court.  She get the long pass, lays it up.  Coach Miller blows her whistle. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) Monica!  Get over here. 
Monica jogs over, sheepish. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) While you're so busy posing, your man just scored! 
Monica drops her head. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) Show me again. 
MONICA What? 
COACH MILLER You love to pose so much, let's see it again. 
Beat, then Monica holds up her arm like she just shot the ball.  Snickers from her teammates. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) I want you to stand like that for the rest of practice. 
MONICA Coach... 
COACH MILLER I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me? (then) Dora, take her spot. 
DORA, freshman, jogs onto the court.  Coach Miller blows her whistle and the scrimmage resumes. 
Monica stands alone on the sideline, posing, and feeling like an asshole. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING 
Monica sits on the bench in front of her locker, dressing after the shower.  Shayla sits next to her. 
Nearby, Lisa and Sandra apply make-up in the mirror.  Zvette passes by, already dressed.  Lisa turns. 
LISA Z, I know you're gonna shower first. 
ZVETTE I don't smell bad. 
SANDRA And you wonder why your ass sits alone on the bus. 
Cree glances over from another sink, as she snaps the chain on her CROSS NECKLACE. 
CREE You guys curse too much. 
SANDRA Since when is "ass" a curse? 
MAEYEN walks past. 
MAEYEN Whoa, it's as big as yours. 
They crack up.  Cree just shakes her head.  Two TEAMMATES pass by Monica with their arms raised, mimicking her pose. Monica shakes her head. 
Sidra glances at Monica from her spot on the bench. 
SIDRA That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman. 
MONICA I was just playing ball. 
SIDRA You were trying to make me look bad. 
MONICA Didn't have to try very hard.

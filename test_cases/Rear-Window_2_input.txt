Jeff hangs up. Stella is now beginning to dig, carefully lifting the flowers off the center of the bed where they had dipped down. She places the flower plants on the sidewalk. Lisa stands facing Jeff's window and occasionally glances over her shoulder uneasily at Stella's work. 
At this moment, the sounds of musical instruments begin to be heard from the songwriter's apartment.

A little annoyed at the interruption, Jeff turns to look at the studio apartment. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
In the songwriter's apartment, several of his musician friends have gathered. One plays a guitar, another a clarinet, and so on. One by one they try out the theme of the songwriter's new melody, running through it in turn to become familiar with the notes. We, therefore, hear the melody played informally in different ways with different instruments.

Jeff shifts his eyes from the songwriter's apartment back to the courtyard.

Stella is busy, expertly handling the shovel. Lisa has her back to the nurse, but looks apprehensively over her shoulder. She then looks up toward Jeff's apartment.

Jeff gives her an encouraging little gesture with his hand. Then his eyes lift a little as he looks up. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Miss Lonely Hearts is sitting on the sofa, writing a note with a pad on her knee. Next to her, on the table, the pills are still in evidence.

Jeff picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the alleyway. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT 
The alleyway and street intersection, with normal night traffic, but no sign of Thorwald. THE CAMERA LENS PANS across and down to the hole being dug by Stella. We get an impression of Lisa's legs as we go by. The spade comes out of the hole and rests on the side. THE CAMERA LENS PANS up just in time to catch Stella turning up to Jeff. She throws out a helpless hand and shakes her head. "Nothing."

Jeff lowers the lens and looks down at the two women with evident disappointment. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Lisa glances up to Thorwald's apartment. She turns and gestures some instructions to Stella. Then she looks up at Jeff and gestures her intention to enter Thorwald's apartment. She turns and dashes toward Thorwald's fire escape as Stella makes a fruitless grab to restrain her.

Jeff, shocked and alarmed, calls out: 
JEFF Lisa -- no! 
He looks quickly toward the intersection and then right back to Lisa. Apparently no sight of Thorwald. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
While Lisa starts up the fire escape, we see Stella running toward the wall in the foreground to climb over it. Stella has abandoned the shovel and left the flowers and dirt strewn over the walk.

Jeff, tense and wide-eyed, watches Lisa climb the fire escape. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Lisa climbs the fire escape to the second floor and the outside of Thorwald's apartment. 
She tries, unsuccessfully, to get through the window which opens into the kitchen from the fire escape. And then, with some difficulty, stretches and succeeds in getting in through the living room window, which is open. She goes directly to the bedroom and we see her bending over one of the suitcases.

Jeff quickly picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the salesman's apartment. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT 
Lisa turns from the suitcase with the alligator handbag in her hand. There is an expression of triumph on her face. She opens it and her expression changes to dismay. She looks toward Jeff's apartment and, to communicate her dismay, she turns the handbag upside down. Nothing falls out. Empty.

He lowers the long-focus lens and he is sweating with anxiety. He mutters, almost to himself: 
JEFF Come on. Come on! Get out of there! 
His eyes turn quickly to the alleyway and back again to Lisa. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Lisa has dropped the bag on the bed and is now looking around the bedroom, looking for some place to start searching for the jewelry. She moves quickly to the dresser and begins opening the drawers to check them. 
She finds nothing. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
As Jeff watches tensely, the door bursts open behind him and Stella hurries into the apartment. 
STELLA Ring Thorwald's phone the second you see him on the way back! 
Jeff swings toward Stella. He reaches for the phone. 
JEFF I'm going to ring him now! 
As he picks up the receiver, Stella pushes his hand down again. 
STELLA Give her another minute -- She's doing this for you. 
Stella looks out the window and her face registers shock. Jeff turns quickly to the window again, forgetting the phone for the moment. 
STELLA Miss Lonely Hearts! 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Miss Lonely Hearts is in the act of popping an envelope up against the table lamp on the table next to the sofa. 
From the same table, she takes a pill bottle and empties the contents into her left hand. Replacing the bottle, she picks up a glass of water. 
STELLA (Off) Call the police!

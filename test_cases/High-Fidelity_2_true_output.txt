The army bag with a red cross on it.  The ring-of-ivy tattoo around the wrist.  The monkey boots.  The eye shadow. 
DICK 
thinking, calculating... 
DICK The interesting thing about Green Day is that so much of their music is in truth directly influenced by, in my opinion, two bands. 
FEMALE CUSTOMER The Clash. 
DICK Correct.  The Clash.  But also the Stranglers. 
FEMALE CUSTOMER Who? 
DICK I think you would love the Stranglers... 
Dick pulls a Stranglers record and puts it on the stereo. Her brow furrows, and then she smiles. 
FEMALE CUSTOMER This sounds great. 
Dick smiles humbly.  Two people in the store turn and approach. 
CUSTOMER Is this the new Green Day? 
BARRY still talking to his Customer, who now has several CD's in his hand.  He looks at Barry with a mixture of hate and adoration. 
BARRY That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television? 
CUSTOMER I have a television. 
BARRY NO--! 
Barry adds more records to the Customer's stack. 
A FEW MINUTES LATER - ROB AND DICK 
stand behind the counter.  Rob holds a CD in his hand, and surveys the roaming customers with a semi-serious air of authority. 
ROB I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux. 
DICK Do it.  Do it. 
Rob pops the CD in and it begins to play... He stands there with his arms folded, waiting.  After a moment, a Customer approaches. 
CUSTOMER (re: music) What is this? 
ROB It's the Royal Trux. 
CUSTOMER It's great. 
ROB I know. 
ROB'S POV 
of the room.  Something has caught his eye: a cropped head with a leopard skin pattern surfaces and disappears, like Nessie. 
Rob's face gets hot and mad.  He jumps out from behind the counter. 
ROB Dick, ring the man up... 
He moves like a cat through the crowd.  Justin sees him coming and counters around the middle island and heads for the door. Vince appears next to him, fiddling with his belt. 
He sees Rob now, and he and Justin bolt for the door.  Rob doubles back. 
ROB DICK!  THE DOOR! 
Dick sees Vince and Justin too late.  Rob is right behind them and as they get out the door, he reaches... and comes up with the back half of a skateboard. 
EXT. RECORD STORE - DAY 
Rob emerges behind them, Vince's skateboard in hand.  They have enough distance to bolt, but they can't leave that board behind. 
ROB Okay, fuckos.  How much is this deck worth to you, and how many CD's did you rip off?  Can you do the math? 
Justin pulls two CD's out and slides them over to Rob. 
ROB (to Vince) And what about you, dork? 
Vince pulls about six, and puts them down in a neutral spot. 
Rob picks all of them up and starts looking through them. 
Dicks pokes his head out of the door.

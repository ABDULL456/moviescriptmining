Joel walks in, still pissed off. Suzie is sitting on the couch, a little surprised to see him. 
SUZIE Oh hi. You're home early. 
JOEL 
(COLD) Hi. Joel walks over to the sliding glass door, looks outside at the pool. It's filthy. 
JOEL So how was that new pool cleaner? Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but she plays it cool. 
SUZIE Um... What do you mean? 
JOEL What do you think I mean?... Did he do a good job cleaning the pool? 
SUZIE Ah... well-- 
JOEL Did he get all the... leaves? It doesn't really look that clean. I mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the guy even clean it at all? It sure doesn't look like it. 
SUZIE 
(NERVOUS) Well yeah, I guess he didn't do a very good job. 
JOEL I think he did a horrible job. I don't think we should use him anymore. 
SUZIE Okay. 
JOEL Okay. Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face. 
SUZIE Are you all right, Joel? You want an aspirin or anything? 
JOEL No. 
INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Quick shot of Joel staring up at the ceiling shaking his head, can't believe all this. 
EXT. STEP'S HOUSE -- NEXT DAY 
In a WIDE SHOT we see Joel's car is parked on the street. He walks up and rings the doorbell. We see Step answer, talk to him and then invite him in. 
INT. STEP'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
Step and Joel enter. Step's 300 POUND HALF-BROTHER sits on a ratty couch watching TV, drinking a huge plastic bottle of Pepsi. He looks like he's been sitting there for years. The TV is deafeningly loud. 
STEP Wow, I don't think you've ever been to my house before. Have you? 
JOEL (talking above the TV) Yeah, I don't think so. I would've remembered... 
STEP This is my half brother Phil. Joel starts to motion "don't get up," then realizes that's not happening anyway. Phil nods. 
JOEL Hi... Hey Step, can we talk in another room. 
STEP Sure, let's go out back. 
EXT. STEP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- A LITTLE LATER 
Joel and Step sit at a picnic table.

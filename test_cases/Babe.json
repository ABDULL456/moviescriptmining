Did you think that Colonel Sanders kept them as pets? \nHe hands Mike a headless chicken, and he slowly starts to pluck it. \n110   INT.

ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nSusan is lying on the floor, moaning softly. Flies hover around the pool of blood under her neck. Richard, worried, strokes her hair. \nThe grandmother brings them a pot of tea with two cups and sets them on the floor beside them. \nRICHARD Thank you. \nThe grandmother goes to sit in a chair. Mohammed walks in and whispers something to him. Anwar turns to Richard. \nANWAR The doctor's here. \n113   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThe doctor walks across the patio, through the tumult of children and before the scrutiny of two police officers. \n114   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThe doctor enters the room. \nDOCTOR (In Arabic) Allah be with you. \nANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) Allah be with you. \nRichard just bows his head slightly. The doctor walks over to Susan, shoos the flies away and examines the wound. She looks at him, anxious. \nDOCTOR (In Arabic) The bullet didn't hit her spine or split her jugular. But it did shatter her clavicle and she could bleed to death. \nAnwar looks worried. \nRICHARD What did he say? \nANWAR He says she will be fine. \nRICHARD Stop lying to me god damn it, and tell me what the fuck he said! \nThe doctor addresses Richard in terrible English. \nDOCTOR Hospital... need hospital... \nRICHARD Yes, we know that. What can you do in the meantime? \nDOCTOR (In Arabic, to Anwar) Tell him I have to stitch up the wound to stop the bleeding. \nAnwar draws close to Richard and whispers. \nANWAR He has to sew up her wounds. \nSusan turns to look at them, suspicious. \nSUSAN What did he say? \nRichard gets nervous. \n", "test1_true": "SUSAN What do you mean stitches? \nThe doctor opens his kit and takes out a rudimentary needle and thread. He gets ready to sew. Richard questions him, also in whispers. \nRICHARD You're not going to give her any anesthetic? \nThe doctor and Anwar exchange a look. \nANWAR (To Richard) No, he doesn't use anesthetic. \nRICHARD What kind of doctor is he? \nAnwar answers naively, in a low voice. \nANWAR He's a veterinarian, but he is good. \nRichard looks at him, surprised and angry. \nRICHARD He can't take care of her. \nSUSAN Richard, he might infect the wound... \nRichard can't answer as he focuses on what the doctor says. \nDOCTOR (In Arabic) Tell him that if I don't stitch up her wound she may bleed to death. \nANWAR If he doesn't sew up the wound, she may bleed to death. \nDOCTOR (In Arabic, to Anwar) And tell him her clavicle is broken. We have to fasten a splint to it. \nANWAR He says she has a broken bone and he has to put a splint on it. \nRichard remains pensive for a moment. He looks at Susan, then at the doctor and assents tentatively. \nDOCTOR (In Arabic) We're going to have to hold her down. \nHe mimes holding her down with his hands. Richard leans over Susan, who weakly languishes on the rug. \nRICHARD Honey, this is going to hurt a little. \nShe stares at him. Richard turns to Anwar and signals that he can begin. Anwar holds her hands. Susan, stupefied, to Richard. \nSUSAN Richard, don't let him... \nThe doctor lifts Susan's neck and starts to stitch.    She howls in pain and tries to move away. \nAnwar and Richard hold Susan down.    The doctor sticks the needle in again. \nSusan shakes her head from side to side trying to pull away. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Don't let him, don't let him. \nRICHARD Calm down... calm down... Susan, they have to sew you up... relax... \nRichard holds her head to keep her still.

Richard puts a rag in her mouth, on which she bites down. \n115   EXT. TINY SHOP -- DAY \nMohammed sits outside with three friends drinking coffee. From where they are we see the bus and the American tourists. A battery powered radio plays Moroccan music and commercials in the background. \nMOHAMMED I don't understand why Anwar brought them here. \nFRIEND 1 Well he spends all his time with them, what do you expect. \nFRIEND 2 The woman is hurt, he had to help her. \nMOHAMMED Yeah?   And when have they helped us? \nFRIEND 1 I liked one of those tourists. \nFRIEND 2 Really?   They're all skin and bones. \nSuddenly Mohammed focuses on the radio. \nMOHAMMED Shh... sh... listen. \nThe friends are quiet. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) Today, near Tazarine, there was an incident where an American was shot... \nOne of the friends interrupts. \nFRIEND 3 Hey look, it's the story. \nFRIEND 2 They said Tazarine, did you hear? We were on the radio... \nMOHAMMED Shh, shut up. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) Although authorities say it could have been a foiled robbery, the American government claims they are certain it was a terrorist attack. Minister Hassef Hazal has said that in our country, terrorist cells have been eradicated, that Morocco is a peaceful country and that one act of vulgar banditry followed by superficial evaluations such as the U.S. intends to place upon it cannot ruin the image, the economy and the pacifist reputation of our country. American Ambassador Ken Jones, however, insists that it was a terrorist attack on American citizens, that it merits a full investigation, and that the guilty should be punished. So far, the attack has not been attributed to any known terrorist organizations... \nMohammed shouts. \nMOHAMMED I fucking told Anwar, I told him he was only going to get us in trouble... he never comes and when he does he always brings trouble...god damn it... \nFRIEND 1 Are the Americans going to invade our country? \nMOHAMMED I don't know. \n116   INT.

He stands up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not, he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks. \nWhen he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks toward the police. One of them policemen looks at him through a pair of binoculars. Alarid interrogates him. \nALARID What's happening? \nPOLICE OFFICER A boy is walking this way. \nALARID Is he armed? \nThe officer takes a careful look. \nPOLICE OFFICER It doesn't look like it. \nALARID What are the others doing? \nThe officer watches Abdullah carrying his wounded son. \nPOLICE OFFICER A man is holding somebody injured. \nALARID Is the other one still walking this way? \nPOLICE OFFICER Yes. \nAlarid turns to the other officers. \nALARID Aim. \nThe police aim and hold Yussef in their sights. He keeps walking resolutely toward his aggressors. He is crying softly, keeping his arms open. \nYussef walks until his is 10 meters away from the police and he kneels with his arms open. \nYUSSEF I killed the American, I was the only one who shot at you... \nCautious, the police still aim at his chest. Yussef proceeds with his confession, babbling it through his nerves, his pain and his attempt to control his sobbing. \nYUSSEF (CONT'D) They did nothing... nothing... \nHe turns to his father and his brother and points at them. \nYUSSEF (CONT'D) Kill me, but save my brother, he did nothing... nothing... \nAlarid moves in, aiming at him with a rifle.    Behind him are five other cops, also ready to shoot. \nALARID On the ground... \nYussef does not obey. \nYUSSEF Save my brother... \nALARID On the ground... \nYussef turns his face toward Alarid looks him in the eye. \nYUSSEF Save my brother... please... \nHe lies on the floor, crying. Alarid puts his gun down and looks at him: his enemy is a disconsolate child. Then he looks up at Abdullah who is screaming his lamentations. He turns to one of his subordinates. \nALARID Go help them. \nOne of the officers goes to help Abdullah and Ahmed.     Yussef lies on the floor, crying. \n166   EXT. DESERT -- NIGHT \nThe sun rises.   Amelia and the children keep walking.    They sweat. \nMIKE I can't walk anymore. \nAMELIA We have to keep walking. \nMIKE Why is the air so hot? \nAmelia stops and tries to distract them. \nAMELIA (the entire dialogue in English) Because coyotes and snakes and quails have already breathed that air. \nMike remains pensive. \nMIKE We're breathing the same air animals breathe? \nAMELIA Yes. \nMIKE And it doesn't rot? \nAMELIA No, it doesn't rot.   We all breathe this air. \n167   EXT. DESERT -- MORNING \nDawn. The three walk through the desert.      Debbie walks mechanically, tired and exhausted. \nDEBBIE I can't anymore.

The children sleep while Amelia, nodding off, tries to keep watch. \n169   EXT. DESERT -- LATER \nIt is well into the morning. Amelia and the children sleep deeply. There is a noise and Amelia opens her eyes. She sees a border patrol truck driving around near them. \nLooking through the branches, she spies on the truck and watches another one join it. Mike awakes and sits up. \nMIKE What happening? \nAmelia ducks and lays Mike face down.    The two trucks slowly approach. \nAMELIA (To Mike, in a low voice, in Spanish) Stay still. \nA truck drives by about eighty yards away and then passes. The other one cuts diagonally across its path and then gets lost in the desert. \nAmelia gets up and shakes off the dust. She looks out of place, wearing her best clothes torn by the bramble. She makes sure the trucks are leaving. \nMIKE Why are we hiding if we didn't do anything wrong? \nAMELIA (In English) Because they think we did something wrong. \nMIKE That's not true: you're bad. \nAmelia freezes upon hearing the boy's words. \nAMELIA No, sweetie, I'm not bad.     I just did something stupid. \nShe pulls him toward her and hugs him tenderly. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) (In Spanish) I love you very much, sweetie. \nAmelia turns and tries to wake Debbie. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) (In English) Debbie, we've got to go. \nThe girl opens her eyes, but doesn't answer. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Debbie, sweetheart, wake up. \nShe closes her eyes again.

DESERT -- LATER \nAmelia carries Debbie in her arms under the burning sun, following a cattle trail. Mike walk behind, pale, sweaty. Amelia looks to the horizon: there is no sign of the trucks. \n171   EXT. DESERT -- DAY \nThey are still walking. Amelia can barely go on. She stops to rest. She is sweating copiously. Mike also looks weak. \n172   EXT. DESERT -- LATER \nThe heat is strong and Amelia is beaten. She looks for the shade of a cluster of mesquites and lays Debbie down.

Stay here and don't move. \nMIKE I'm not staying here alone. \nAMELIA Honey, you have to take care of Debbie. \nMIKE I'm going with you. \nMike looks at her with imploring eyes.   Amelia caresses him. \nAMELIA I won't be long. I promise. \n173   EXT. DESERT -- DAY \nAmelia desperately looks through the desert.   She also looks dehydrated. She drifts. \n174   EXT. DESERT -- DAY \nAmelia drags her feet as she walks.   She can go no further. \n175   EXT. DESERT -- DAY \nAmelia sees a small hillock and climbs it with difficulty.

ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nRichard and the vet carry Susan out on a wheelbarrow. It is very difficult to move her. She is clearly in pain and groans quietly. \nOutside the house is the policeman with his Peugeot. Anwar is talking to him. \nRichard and the vet carry Susan all the way to the car. Richard stands before the policeman he humiliated earlier. \nRICHARD Thank you for lending us the car. \nAnwar translates. \nANWAR (In Arabic) He thanks you for lending us the car. \nThe policeman nods kindly. \nDozens of girls and boys and a few adults stare at the scene. \nGingerly, Richard, Anwar and the vet lift her into the car and softly lay her on the back seat. \nEven so, she screams in pain. \nSUSAN Ahhh... Ahhh... \nRichard holds her hand and squeezes it. \nRICHARD Sweetie, you've got to hold on. \nRichard gets into the car, and as they're about to drive off, the shopkeeper runs up to them. \nTENDERO (In Arabic) Stop...

I'm very sorry about what happened to your wife, but you can be sure that the culprits will be punished. \nRICHARD My wife is dying. She's in urgent need of medical attention. \nKEN (O.S.) We're working on it... \nRichard interrupts angrily. \nRICHARD We've been here for five hours. What the fuck are you waiting for? \nKEN (O.S.) The Moroccan government won't let us use their airspace.

Stay put... we've settled the matter. A helicopter should arrive soon... \nRICHARD We can't wait any longer. \nKEN (O.S.) The helicopter is on its way.

She looks worried. \nAMELIA How are they? \nPOLICE OFFICER That's none of your business, ma'am. \nThe man's words hurt Amelia, who looks away to avoid crying. \nPOLICE OFFICER (CONT'D) You've committed serious crimes. \n", "test3_true": "POLICE OFFICER No ma'am, you did not just do that. You took them to another country without their parents' permission and you put them in danger. \nAMELIA Sir, I raised these kids since they were born. I take care of them day and night. I feed them breakfast, lunch and dinner. I play with them. Mike and Debbie are like my own children. \nPOLICE OFFICER (sternly) But they are not your kids, ma'am. \nAMELIA What about my nephew, Santiago? \nPOLICE OFFICER I don't have any information on him. \nAmelia looks destitute. \nPOLICE OFFICER (CONT'D) We located the parents in Morocco. They're very angry, but they've decided not to raise charges. \nAmelia exhales, relieved.   The policeman leans toward her. \nPOLICE OFFICER (CONT'D) Nevertheless, the government of the United States has deemed you were seriously breaking the law and has decided to immediately and definitively deport you. \nAmelia loses her breath. \nAMELIA I've been living here for fifteen years. My things are here, I rent a house, I made my life here. \nPOLICE OFFICER You should've thought of that beforehand. \nAMELIA I want to talk to a lawyer. \nPOLICE OFFICER If you attempt to take this to court, I assure you you will end up in jail.

He also pulls out some matches and lights one. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Thank you. \n187   EXT. STREET, TIJUANA -- EVENING \nAmelia smokes, drifting. After a while she sits on a sidewalk and leans on a post. She looks into the street at the people passing by and starts crying softly. \nA dusty and battered pick up truck arrives.

HAMLET -- EVENING \nThe truck is parked in front of Anwar's house. Richard and Susan wait in the back while the boy, Anwar and the vet lean on the hood. \nSuddenly a helicopter with American insignia flies over them and goes to land in an empty lot. \nAnwar looks up and watches the helicopter descend. The helicopter kicks up a cloud of dust before the stunned gaze of dozens of children. Some camels are frightened. Some starving dogs bark at it. \n189   EXT. TOWN -- EVENING \nThey carry Susan to the helicopter in a stretcher. They load her in carefully. Richard follows her through the wind generated by the helicopter. Anwar catches up to them to say goodbye. \nANWAR Good luck, mister... \nRICHARD Thank you for everything. \nRichard gives Anwar a hug which he responds to affectionately. Richard takes out his wallet and holds out three hundred- dollar bills, which Anwar rejects. \nANWAR No sir, no...

The helicopter approaches. The cameramen hurry to position themselves for a better shot. \nA reporter speaks to the camera. \nREPORTER In this helicopter is Susan Jones, an American mother of two who was seriously injured in a terrorist attack. It appears fundamentalist organizations planned the attack... \nThe helicopter settles softly in the parking lot. It is immediately surrounded by several Moroccan soldiers. The doctors on the ground prepare the stretcher. \nKen walks hurriedly toward the chopper, guarding himself from the wind. \nSusan is immediately placed on the stretcher and quickly taken to the emergency room. Richard follows close behind until his is intercepted by Ken. \nKEN Mr. Jones, I'm Ken Clifford, Ambassador to the United States. \nRichard keeps running behind the stretcher.   Ken stops him. \nKEN (CONT'D) A first rate medical team is going to tend to her, but if you want we can take her to a hospital in Italy as soon as she's stable... \nRICHARD Thank you... \nKEN There are lots of reporters waiting. Is there anything you want to say to the press?

{"train": "BABEL \nWritten by \nGuillermo Arriaga \n(April 9, 2005) \n1   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MORNING \nDay breaks. Hassan (50) arrives at a solitary house made of adobe, in the southern deserts of Morocco, carrying a satchel and a large bundle wrapped in cloth. \nHe walks past a corral made out of branches, where several goats bleat, and knocks on the front door. \n2   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nAbdullah (40), opens. \nHASSAN (In Arabic) Good morning Abdullah... I brought you this... \nHe holds up the bundle. \n3   INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nAbdullah's family is inside the house. There is a room, a small table and a simple kitchen. Yasira (38) is roasting some goat meat assisted by Yamil (16) and Zora (17), her daughters. \nAbdullah and his sons, Yussef (13) and Ahmed (14), are sitting on the floor around the small table, looking at a well- conserved .270 caliber Winchester 60 rifle. \nHASSAN (To Abdullah) It's almost new. \nHe takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel. \nHASSAN (CONT'D) Three hundred cartridges... \nHe opens a box and shows them one of the golden bullets. \nHASSAN (CONT'D) The hunter who gave it to me said you can hit up to three kilometers away. \nABDULLAH How much do you want for everything? \nHASSAN One thousand dirhams. \nABDULLAH One thousand dirhams? I'll give you one thousand and a goat. \nAbdullah and Hassan exchange a look and Hassan smiles. \n4   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY \nHassan and Abdullah's family are behind the house. Hassan stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards away and he turns toward Abdullah. \nHASSAN With this rifle, your sons will be able to kill plenty of jackals. \nHe aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding the rifle properly. It is clear that he doesn't know how to fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. The rifle kicks and hits him roughly in the shoulder. The bullet flies far wide of the rock. The women laugh nervously. \nRubbing his shoulder, Hassan turns to Abdullah. \nHASSAN (CONT'D) Let one of your sons shoot. \nAbdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one. \nABDULLAH Let Yussef shoot. \nWhen Hassan is about to hand Yussef the rifle, Ahmed cuts him off, upset. \nAHMED I want to shoot first. \nFather and son exchange an angry glance. Hassan, without realizing it, turns and gives the rifle to Ahmed. The boy grabs the gun: it is heavier than he thought. \nHASSAN Look, load it like this. \nHassan opens the chamber, inserts the bullet and then closes it. Once it is loaded, he points at the safety. \nHASSAN (CONT'D) This is the safety. Push it in when you're ready. \nAhmed nods. Unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and, almost without aiming, fires. The shot kicks up dust far from the rock. His sisters laugh. \nHASSAN (CONT'D) If he doesn't hit the jackals, at least he'll scare the shit out of them. \nAhmed lowers the rifle. His father grabs it and gives it to Yussef enthusiastically. \nABDULLAH Your turn. \nYussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. He lifts the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. He seems innately skilled at the maneuver. He shoots and the bullet hits just below the rock. \nAbdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to Hassan. \nABDULLAH (CONT'D) Now this kid shoots a hell of a lot better than you. \n5   EXT. GOAT CORRAL -- LATER \nYussef takes one of the goats out, ties and ropes it and gives it to Hassan. Abdullah supervises. Yasira approaches and gives Abdullah a bag. \nYASIRA Your lunch. \nAbdullah takes it and turns to his sons. \nABDULLAH You better kill at least three jackals. \nHASSAN And make sure no one sees you with the rifle, hide it if you see someone approach you. \nAhmed nods.   Abdullah and Hassan go on their way. \n6   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- LATER \nYasira and Yamil are far from the house, cleaning some goatskins stretched out on some branches. \nLUCIA (Both in Spanish) I can't Amelia. \nAMELIA Please, it's my son's wedding. I helped you out with that thing with your boyfriend. \nLUCIA I really can't. \nAMELIA Just for the day, Lucia.   I'll be back for them tonight. \nLUCIA And what do I tell Mrs. Black? \nAMELIA Tell her they're your nephews. \nLucia looks down at the blonde-haired, blue-eyed children. \nLUCIA Yeah right, they look just like me...with this gringa look I have. \n21   INT. CHILDREN'S ROOM, L.A. HOUSE -- DAY \nAmelia is packing the children's clothes in a small suitcase. Debbie and Mike, curious, watch her. \nMIKE Are we going to see your house? \nAMELIA Yes, you're going to see my house. \nMIKE Is it far? \nAMELIA (In Spanish) Not very. \n22   EXT. LOS ANGELES HOUSE -- DAY \nA run-down '88 Ford Pinto parks in front of the house and honks its horn. The front door opens and Amelia walks out, carrying the small suitcase, with the two kids. \nSantiago (24), a young Mexican with light eyes. \nSANTIAGO (Both in Spanish) Good morning Aunt Amelia. \nAMELIA Good morning. \nSantiago, surprised, looks at the children. \nSANTIAGO Are they coming? \nAMELIA I couldn't find anyone to leave them with. Their parents aren't coming back today. \nSANTIAGO Why bring them, they're just going to make trouble. \nAMELIA They're good kids. \nSANTIAGO I know a woman who can take care of them. \nAMELIA Santiago, I have to take them. I can't leave them with just anybody. \nSANTIAGO What if you lose your job? \nAMELIA Come on, don't tempt the fates. \nAmelia opens the door for the children to get in. \n23   EXT. CASBAH TAMNOUGALT, MOROCCO-- DAY \nRichard (45), tall, thin, weathered, and Susan (38), good- looking, with an athletic body, visit the impressive Casbah with a group of American, French and English tourists. Most of them are old, with a few couples in their forties or fifties. \nAnwar (30), a man with a kind face, is the tour guide showing them around. \nANWAR (In English, with an Arabic accent) The Berbers built these kasbahs. They made them like forts and here they would reside after finishing their caravans. \nRichard listens attentively.   Susan looks hot. \nRICHARD This place is beautiful, don't you think? \nSUSAN (not very enthusiastically) Yeah, yeah it's very pretty... \nAnwar walks toward one end of the aisles and calls the group. \nANWAR Now, I'd like to show you the materials that were used to build the walls... \nThe herd moves docile toward Anwar's voice. \n24   EXT. SMALL EATERY, MOROCCAN DESERT -- LATER \nThe group of tourists spread about a small eatery with open air tables on a dusty terrace. A bus is parked behind them. \nAt a table, on one end of the terrace with views to a cluster of mountains, Richard and Susan look through some menus. Richard seems at ease in this place. Susan appears to be bothered by the dust and otherness. \nA waiter brings a plate and some cutlery. \nWAITER (in broken English) You want to order? \nRICHARD I'll have a chicken cous-cous and a Coke, please. \nSUSAN What do you have that doesn't have fat in it? \nWAITER Everything is delicious. \nSusan reads the menu again. \nSUSAN I'll have the fried eggplant and a diet Coke. \nWAITER We don't have diet Coke. \nSUSAN Then a regular Coke. \nThe waiter smiles and goes to place the order. Susan takes out a small bottle with antibacterial gel, cleans her hands and then starts wiping the plate and the cutlery thoroughly. \nRichard looks at the mountain range through a pair of binoculars. He spots a hawk flying over the plains. \nIn an indoor volleyball court with bleachers, several Japanese girls play volleyball. They all compete intensely for the point. There is excitement, but everything occurs quietly. \nA player jumps and spikes the ball. Chieko (16), tall, beautiful, with strands of hair painted purple, volleys the ball back up. It reaches one of her teammates who sets up another to spike it. \nChieko's team wins the point. The referee, instead of whistling, lifts up a red flag. \nThe players congratulate each other silently, in sign language. The only sound we can here is the parents' clapping as they watch the game from the stands. \nChieko's team serves. Again, the game is heated. A rival player spikes the ball, and it is barely out of bounds. However, the referee, with his red flag, calls the point. \nChieko is upset and goes to argue with him. \nCHIEKO (In sign language) The ball was out. \nREFEREE (In sign language) No, it was good. \nChieko gestures violently.   One of her teammates goes to calm her down. \nTEAMMATE Let it go. \nChieko breaks loose and approaches the referee. \nCHIEKO That was out. \nREFEREE It was on the line. \nCHIEKO You're not just deaf, you're blind. \nREFEREE You're out. \nChieko is furious.   She starts to make obscene gestures. \nCHIEKO You're an asshole. \nThe coach walks onto the court. He holds her to calm her down and then takes her away. Despite Chieko's violent reaction, everything is still silent. From the bleachers, Yasujiro (47), Chieko's father, dressed in a nice suit with the tie undone, with a sad pride about him, disapproves of his daughter's actions. \n30   INT. LOCKER ROOM, VOLLEYBALL COURT -- DAY \nChieko sits on a bench in her underwear. She looks aggravated and absorbed in her own thoughts. Her other teammates get dressed. Two of them walk past wrapped in towels, freshly showered, and stand in front of her. They talk to each other in sign language. \nTEAMMATE 1 You shouldn't have lost your temper. We lost the game. \nCHIEKO It wasn't my fault, it was the ref. \nTEAMMATE 2 If you hadn't been thrown out, we would've won the game. \nChieko, angry, gets up and starts to rummage through her locker. Her teammate walks over and gets her attention. \nTEAMMATE 1 Why are you in a bad mood? \nChieko doesn't answer.    Teammate 2 approaches. \nTEAMMATE 2 She's always in a bad mood because nobody's fucked her yet. \nShe caps this with an obscene gesture that bothers Chieko. \nCHIEKO I'm gonna fuck your dad to get rid of my mood. \nTeammate 1 laughs, amused. Teammate 2 gives Chieko a scornful look. Chieko smiles sardonically. \n31   INT. YASUJIRO'S CAR -- DAY \nYasujiro drives while Chieko looks at the swarming Tokyo streets. She is wearing a skirt revealing of her long volleyball legs. \nHer fathers speaks to her in sign language. \nYASUJIRO What do you want to eat? \nCHIEKO I said I'd meet my friends from the team at Eve's. \nYASUJIRO Weren't we going to have lunch together? \nCHIEKO Dad, I told you I was going to eat with them, but you never pay attention to me. \nYasujiro shakes his head in disapproval. \nCHIEKO (CONT'D) My mother always paid attention to me. \nYASUJIRO Why do you want to fight? \nThey don't say anything else.   The traffic is chaotic. \nYASUJIRO (CONT'D) I miss your mother too. \nChieko just looks at him. \nYASUJIRO (CONT'D) I'm doing what I can, sweetie. \nThey don't say anything else.   The traffic is chaos. \n32   EXT. STREET, TOKYO -- DAY \nYasujiro parks his car and Chieko gets out. \nYASUJIRO (in sign language) Don't forget you have the dentist at four. \nChieko looks annoyed, and blows her father a kiss goodbye. As she is about to get out of the car, Yasujiro grabs her arm. She turns to look at him. \nYASUJIRO (CONT'D) (In sign language) I love you very much. \nThey exchange a glance.   She nods, closes the door and leaves. \n33   INT. EVE'S -- DAY \nEve's is a restaurant full of t.v.'s, noise, video games. There is smoke, and people talking everywhere. Chieko moves through the crowd. A hostess intercepts her. \nZORA (CONT'D) I asked you what's wrong. \nAhmed, full of adrenaline, glances angrily at her. \nAHMED What do you care, whore? \nYussef gets in the way. \nYUSSEF Don't talk to her like that. \nYussef steps up to defend her, but Ahmed spins around and goes into the house. Yussef turns to Zora. \nYUSSEF (CONT'D) Something we ate make us sick so we came back. \nWithout another word, Yussef also goes into the house. \n39   INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- LATER \nYussef and Ahmed are sitting on their mats, looking at each other, pale, scared and quiet. Yasira walks in to see them, followed by her daughters. She turns to Ahmed. \nYASIRA What are you doing here? \nAhmed, livid, cannot answer. \nYUSSEF Something we ate gave us a stomach ache. \nYasira stares harshly at Ahmed. \nYASIRA And is that why you're insulting your sister? \nAhmed looks at Zora, then Yussef, and then is silent. \nYUSSEF We were feeling really ill. \nYasira points toward the corral. \nYASIRA The goats are going to feel even worse if they don't eat. Take them out again. \nAHMED Our stomach really hurts. \nYASIRA Then start jerking the meat. \nYasira walks out.    Yussef and Zora exchange a look. \n40   INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY \nYussef and Ahmed are jerking a couple of young goats with very sharp knives. They set the thin strips on newspaper. \nThey look nervous.    They talk in whispers. \nAHMED D'you think something happened? \nYUSSEF I don't know. \nAHMED People were screaming. \nThey are silent for a long while. \nAHMED (CONT'D) It was your fault. \nYussef stares at him in disbelief. \nYUSSEF It was both our faults. We both shot. (A beat) Swear to me you'll never say anything. \nAhmed won't answer. Yussef looks around the room to make sure nobody is listening to them. \nYUSSEF (CONT'D) Swear.     Nobody, never. \nAhmed remains pensive.    He sighs and answers. \nAHMED I swear.   Nobody. \n41   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- EVENING \nThe brothers are hanging the strips of meat on ropes to dry them in the sun. \nAn old Valiant packed with seven men parks in front of the house and Abdullah gets out. He raises his hand to say goodbye. \nABDULLAH Thank you, I'll see you tomorrow. \nThe driver also raises his hand and then drives off.   Abdullah turns to Yussef. \nABDULLAH (CONT'D) Tell your mother to prepare dinner. \nAbdullah turns towards the house. Yussef comes out running towards a little field below the house. Yasira is plowing with a manual plow. \nYUSSEF Mother, mother, father says he wants to have dinner now. \n42   INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- EVENING \nAbdullah and his children sit at the small table while the women prepare the food. A column of smoke rises from the fire where they are roasting goat meat and toasting bread. \nYamil, the youngest of the daughters, sets some bread on the table. Abdullah takes it, tears some off and starts to eat. He turns to Yussef. \nABDULLAH Did you kill any jackals? \nYUSSEF We shot at them, but didn't hit them. \nABDULLAH You have to kill them. If not they're going to eat all the goats. \nYasira sets the strips of goat meat on the table. Abdullah serves himself some. His children wait until he's done to serve themselves. \nYASIRA Why are you home so late? \nAbdullah starts talking with his mouth full. \nDEBBIE I don't like Mexico. \n51   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY \nThey drive down the highway and then turn onto a path. They drive down the path at high speed, lifting up clouds of dust. \n52   EXT. HAMLET \"LOS LOBOS\" -- DAY \nThey arrive at a dusty hamlet in the middle of the desert; a few houses, no more than twenty, some adorned with multicolored paper. \nSeveral crates of soda are stacked up against a makeshift shed built out of yucca fronds. A group of musicians who play Norte\u00f1a music are setting up their instruments. \nThere are various pickup trucks and smuggled cars parked around the hamlet. The guests are wearing their best: fresh shirts, big buckles, almost new boots. \nSantiago parks. Amelia gets out first.     A group of people sees her and comes over to greet her. \nCOMADRE 1 (All in Spanish) Hey, so you finally made it. \nAmelia smiles.   Her friends notices Mike and Debbie. \nCOMADRE 1 (CONT'D) You brought them? \nAmelia nods. Luis (24), Amelia's son, a typical Norte\u00f1o cowboy with long sideburns and moustache, his face tanned from days under the sun, wearing a pistachio-colored tuxedo with a cloth flower in the lapel, greets Amelia with a kiss. \nLUIS Hi mom, how're you doing? \nShe looks him up and down. \nAMELIA Son, you look like Pedro Infante. \nCOMADRE 1 More like Luis Miguel. \nAMELIA Where's the bride? \nLUIS She's not here yet. \nAMELIA What d'you mean she's not here yet? \nLUIS Well, she ain't here. \nMike and Debbie, struck dumb by the language and the strangers, hide behind Amelia, who introduces them to Luis. \nAMELIA Look son, these are Mike and Debbie, the kids I take care of. \nLuis holds his hand out ceremoniously. \nLUIS Pleased to meet you Mike. \nSantiago calls out to some kids who are running around. \nSANTIAGO Psst.   Lucio, come here. \nLucio (10), the oldest of the gang, approaches.   Santiago gestures toward the two American kids. \nSANTIAGO (CONT'D) These are Mike and Debbie. Keep an eye on them for me. \nLucio gives them a scornful glance and calls them over half- heartedly. \nLUCIO Come with me. \nWith her hand, Amelia signals to the kids that it's ok to go with him. Shyly, Debbie and Mike follow. \n53   INT. ROOM, HAMLET \"LOS LOBOS\" -- DAY \nAmelia is in a room with her two daughters standing in front of a peeling and broken mirror putting on her violet gown. One of her daughters helps her and pulls the zipper all the way up. \nDAUGHTER 1 (All in Spanish) Oh ma, I don't know how you did it but it zipped up perfectly. \nAMELIA And it's been 15 years since I last wore this dress. \nDAUGHTER 1 You haven't changed a bit, ma. \nAMELIA Working, dear, working, that's what keeps one young. \nThe two sisters realize that the dress has a hole just below the seat, exchange looks and smile, which doesn't please Amelia. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) What are you guys laughing about? \nDAUGHTER 2 Nothing ma, nothing. \nAmelia looks at them suspiciously, turns around and leaves the room with her dress elegantly torn. \n54   EXT. DESERT ROAD, MOROCCO -- DAY \nThe bus is in the middle of the road. \nSeveral of the tourists are hiding under their seats, frightened. The driver, still ducking, looks toward the mountains to try to piece together what happened. \nRichard holds Susan against his shoulder, blood gushing from her neck. Her eyes are open and staring at a fading world. \nRichard takes Susan from under her armpits and carefully lays her down on the aisle. Anwar runs over to help. \nRICHARD Take it easy honey, take it easy. \nAnwar takes his shirt off - left only in his undershirt - and puts it under Susan's neck. \nSUSAN (mumbling senselessly) I'm ok... I'm ok... \nSusan breathes in, and every time she does, blood flows from her wound. Richard turns toward the other passengers. \nRICHARD Is anybody a doctor? \nNobody answers.   Richard starts to lose his cool. \nRICHARD (CONT'D) Please: a doctor. \nANWAR Yes sir, this is my house. \nRichard tries to carry Susan, but she screams in pain. \nRICHARD Easy, darling, easy... \nHe slips his hands under her and lifts her up. \nSUSAN Don't touch me there. \nRichard moves his hand, which is covered in blood. As he carries her, he turns into the aisle while Anwar and one of the passengers try to help him. \n65   EXT. HAMLET -- DAY \nRichard carries her into the house through a crowd of curious children. \n66   INT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nAnwar leads Richard down the hallways amidst Susan's screams. \n67   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThey walk through a dusty patio and Anwar points at some stairs. Richard climbs them with difficulty and Anwar opens the door to a room. \nANWAR Here... here... \n68   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nAn old woman (87), Anwar's grandmother, who has centuries of desert in her expression, lets them in and points at a rug on the floor. \nANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) Put her there... \nRichard understands and softly lays Susan on the rug. Susan looks around horrified: adobe walls, dirt floor: the epitome of the third world. \nRICHARD I need to call an ambulance and contact my embassy. \nANWAR If you have the number of the embassy, I can go call. \nObviously, Richard does not have it. \nRICHARD I need to make a phone call. \nANWAR Of course, come with me. \nThey get ready to leave and Susan starts imploring. \nSUSAN Don't leave me here alone... \nRICHARD Don't worry, I'll be right back. \nSusan looks desperate. To set Richard somewhat at ease, Anwar points at his Grandmother. \nANWAR She can take care of her. \nRichard leans over Susan. \nRICHARD You're going to be ok. \nAnwar kneels down next to her, takes a cloth and improvises a tourniquet that he adjusts near her shoulder. He turns towards the grandmother. \nANWAR (In Arabic) Hold and release the tourniquet every once in a while. \nThe grandmother nods. She sees the swarm of kids looking into the place and she shoos them away. \nANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) Get out of here... out... \nThe kids obey, except for one or two who take one last look before they go. Susan's terrified eyes watch Anwar and Richard leave the room. \n69   EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThe bus is still parked in front of the house. As soon as Richard walks out, the pensioners approach him. \nDOUGLAS How is your wife? \nRICHARD Bad. Very bad. \nTom (51), a fat English passenger, faces him. \nTOM Get her outta there and let's go. \nRICHARD And where should I take her? \nTOM In Egypt, in a town like this, they slit thirty German tourists' throats. They might do the same to us. \nAnwar listens and intervenes. \nANWAR No, not here. \nTOM (Aggressively) What do you know? We have to get out of here as soon as possible. \nLilly (79), an old woman, approaches. \nLILLY It's very hot, sir, and the driver turned off the air conditioning. I'm feeling sick. \nRICHARD You can't leave us here. \nJames (82), Lilly's husband, steps forward. \nJAMES What's the use in staying? \nRICHARD In case I need the bus. \nJAMES They can go drop us off and then come back for you. \nDouglas (75), a tall old man with good posture, interjects. \nAnwar is walking back when he is stopped by Mohammed, his brother, a fat man (32) with curly hair and a tanned face. \nMOHAMMED (the entire dialogue in Arabic) Why did you bring them here? \nAnwar doesn't pay attention to him and keeps walking toward the room. His brother catches up to him. \nMOHAMMED (CONT'D) You should have consulted with us. \nAnwar stops and looks at him fixedly. \nANWAR She's hurt, we had to take care of her. \nMOHAMMED In town they're saying she was shot by terrorists. Do you know what they're going to do to us when they find out she's here? \nANWAR Don't be paranoid and go help find the doctor. \nAnwar pays no more attention to him and carries the basin into the room. \n75   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nSusan is lying down. A small pool of blood has collected under her neck. She looks restless. She whispers weakly. \nSUSAN Get me out of here... please... \nRICHARD I'm going to as soon as I can. I've already called Rachel; she's going to tell the embassy. \nSUSAN I told you we shouldn't have come. \nJust then Anwar enters. The grandmother takes the basin and sets it in a corner. She gets some pieces of cloth and starts to soak them. \nRICHARD How long until the ambulance gets here? \nANWAR About an hour and a half. It's coming from Alnif. \nRICHARD That much? Isn't there anyone here who could take her? \nAnwar shakes his head. \nRICHARD (CONT'D) We've got to get her out of here. There's no one to tend to her. \nANWAR My brother already called a doctor, he's coming. \nRichard is going to say something, but holds back.   His despair and confusion are evident. \nANWAR (CONT'D) Trust my grandmother; she knows a lot about remedies. \nThe grandmother wrings out the rags and puts them on a table. She takes some herbs, a fistful of earth from the floor and she tosses them into the basin. She stirs it and pulls out a clump of mud which she lays out on one of the pieces of cloth. \nSusan looks horrified at the dirt. The grandmother leans over her and tries to clean the wound with the other moistened rags. Susan resists. \nANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) I have to clean you. \nANWAR (To Susan) Miss, my grandmother is going to help you. \nThe grandmother finishes cleaning her with the damp cloths and grabs the clump of mud. She tries to put it on the wound, but Susan flinches. \nSUSAN No, not that. \nANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) It will stop the bleeding. \nSUSAN No, no... not that... \nRichard intervenes. \nRICHARD (To Anwar) Let's wait for the doctor. \n76   EXT. HAMLET -- DAY \nTwo old men walk through the streets. \n77   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nMohammed walks into the room and calls him. \nMOHAMMED (In Arabic) The sheik and the moukadem are here. \n78   EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThe two men walk past the tourists and head inside without knocking or asking for permission. \n79   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nRichard and Anwar have walked out into the patio to wait for them. The sheik approaches. \nSHEIK (In Arabic) Allah be with you. \nANWAR (In Arabic) Allah be with you. \nHe turns to Richard and speaks to him in very bad French. \nSHEIK (In bad French) I am Atallah the sheik and this is Walid, the moukadem. I'm very sorry about your wife. \nRICHARD I don't understand French. \nANWAR He says he is very sorry about your wife. \nRichard thanks him with a nod. \nSHEIK (To Anwar, in Arabic) Tell him that I want to ask him some questions. \nANWAR (To Richard) Can he ask you some questions? \nRichard nods.   The sheik continues in Arabic. \nSHEIK (In Arabic) Do you have any enemies in this country? \n84   INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY \nChieko enters the lobby. Beside the doorman are two men dressed in suits: Kenji (31) and Hamano (50). The janitor gestures at Chieko with his chin. The men walk over toward her and cut her off. \nHAMANO Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter? \nChieko doesn't manage to read his lips. She is silent. The doorman notices the situation, walks out from behind his small desk and shouts at the men. \nDOORMAN She's deaf mute. Face her when you speak so she can read your lips. \nKenji and Hamano are disconcerted. Hamano stands squarely in front of her and speaks slowly, emphasizing every word. \nHAMANO Are-you-Yasujiro-Wataya's-daughter? \nShe nods. \nHAMANO (CONT'D) We-are-sargeants-Kenji-Mamiya-and- Hamano-Kanoo-of-the-Tokyo-police. We-need-to-find-your-father. \nShe pulls out a pen and a piece of paper from her bag.   She scrawls a few lines and hands them over. \nHamano reads it and turns his face toward hers. \nHAMANO (CONT'D) No, he didn't do anything wrong. We just want to talk to him. Do you know where he is? \nShe shrugs her shoulders. Kenji gives her his card. Upon receiving it, Chieko turns to look at him. Their eyes meet and she looks down. She then looks up again, blushing. \nKENJI Tell him to call us. And don't be scared, we're not going to do anything bad to him. \nHAMANO Thank you. \nChieko can't stop staring at Kenji. The two cops leave.    As soon as they do, Chieko heads toward the elevator. \n85   INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nChieko walks into the apartment. It is a large apartment, elegantly furnished. Although decoration is scant, some hunting trophies stand out: a scimitar-horned Oryx, sheep, and others. There are also photographs of Yasujiro hunting. \nA wall is dedicated to family photos. Among them is a picture of Chieko as a little girl with her father and her mother. \nChieko sees a note on the table at the entrance. She puts the policeman's card down and picks up a note from her father that says: \"I waited until five and you didn't make it. I've got a meeting and I'll be back late. I left you some soup and some chicken for dinner. Kisses. Papa.\" \n86   INT. CHIEKO'S ROOM -- DAY \nChieko sits in front of a mute T.V., channel surfing.   She stops at a fashion show, then some cartoons. \nSuddenly, on a news program, we see the photographs of Ahmed and Yussef. Chieko looks at them for a moment and then changes the channel. She is watching T.V. when a red bulb, set between a yellow bulb and a blue one, starts to light up insistently as the doorbell rings. \nChieko notices and shuts off the T.V. \n87   INT. LIVING ROOM, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nChieko opens the door and Mitsu walks in. They greet each other with a handshake where they end up touching their index fingers to each other's hearts. \nMITSU Are you ready? \nCHIEKO Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag. \nChieko goes to get her bag. Mitsu sees the policeman's card on the entrance table and looks at it. Chieko comes back and Mitsu asks her about it in sign language. \nMITSU The cops came again? \nCHIEKO Yeah. They hadn't come in nine months. But these were different cops. \nMITSU Did they come to ask about your mothers' death? \nCHIEKO No, but they're probably going to ask my dad about the same things. \nMITSU They're just not convinced, are they? \nChieko shakes her head, remains pensive and then smiles. \nCHIEKO Believe it or not, I liked one of the cops. \nChieko puts Kenji's card in her purse. \nMITSU Did you put on some panties? \nChieko smiles, lifts up her skirt and exposes her naked pubis. Mitsu lifts hers up as well and is also without panties. They laugh and leave the apartment. \n88   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nDawn. The desert is a rose plain softly lit by the sun's first rays. Yussef and Ahmed are digging a hole with their bare hands. Once they're finished, they clean up around the hole and mark it with three stones. \n89   EXT. HIGHWAY, DESERT -- MORNING \nAlarid (40), a federal cop, tall, in an impeccable uniform with numerous rank badges, stands on the highway examining the site of the shot with the old man who was driving. \nIn the distance we can see a police checkpoint stopping some cars and, after checking them, letting them go. \nALARID (To the old man, the entire dialogue in Arabic) Are you sure it was here? \nOLD MAN Sure. I drive down this road every day. The American tried to stop me right here. \nHe stands more or less where Richard tried to stop him. \nOLD MAN (CONT'D) I was scared. He was covered in blood and I was coming from picking up my grandson from his work. \nALARID Where was the bus? \nThe old man points some twenty yards behind him. \nOLD MAN Over there. \nAlarid walks toward where the old man said and looks out at the mountains. Some of his men are visible at the tops. Alarid talks to them by radio. \nALARID Look further to the right. \nThe two brothers bundle up the skins, tie them up with some cord and they leave down the path away from the house. \n96   EXT. DESERT -- DAY \nAs they climb a hill, they encounter a convoy of Moroccan police trucks. They are terrified. The vehicles screech to a dramatic halt before them, lifting up much dust. \nAlarid opens the passenger window. \nALARID Hey, do you know where Abdullah Adboum lives? \nAhmed and Yussef exchange a glance.   Yussef nods. \nYUSSEF Yes. \nAhmed gets very nervous.   Yussef points the wrong way with an air of certainty. \nYUSSEF (CONT'D) Over there, you have to cross those mountains. \nALARID They told us he lived around here. \nYUSSEF No, we just live here with our mother. Abdullah lives over there. \nAlarid scrutinizes the brothers' faces. \nALARID If you're lying to me I'm going to come back and cut your balls off. \nAhmed breathes nervously.    Yussef continues in cold blood. \nYUSSEF You can come back whenever you like. \nAlarid smiles and gestures at the driver with his head that they should go on. The police vehicles drive off in the direction Yussef pointed them in. \n97   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY \nAhmed and Yussef run home. Their mother and sisters are milking some goats into a tin bucket. When they fill, Abdullah empties the milk out into a barrel. \nAHMED Papa... papa... \nAbdullah puts the bucket down on the floor and turns to look at his kids, who stop before him, panting, exhilarated. \nABDULLAH What happened? \nAhmed can barely control his gasping. \nAHMED The police... they're looking for you... \nABDULLAH Me?    Why? \nYUSSEF No, they're not looking for you... they're looking for us... \nABDULLAH You?    Why? \nYUSSEF Because of what happened to the tourist... \nYasira and her two daughters stop milking and approach. Abdullah can't seem to understand what their talking about. \nABDULLAH What tourist? \nAHMED The American... Yussef killed her... \nYUSSEF That's not true, we both did. \nYASIRA What are you saying? \nAhmed fires his words out. \nAHMED Yussef started shooting at the cars because Hassan said that the bullet could go really far... \nYUSSEF That's a lie, you started shooting at the cars. \nAHMED Yes, but you killed her. \nAbdullah loses his patience and grabs Ahmed by the shoulders. \nABDULLAH What the hell are you talking about? \nAhmed looks at his father straight in the eyes. \nAHMED Yussef killed the American and he spies on Zora naked and Zora lets him watch her... \nAbdullah turns toward Zora.   In his mind, everything is confusion. \nABDULLAH What is your brother talking about? \nZORA That's bullshit. \nAHMED It's not bullshit; she's a whore and my brother spies on her... \nAs soon as the words leave Ahmed's mouth, Yussef decks him and leaves him sprawled on the dust. \nAhmed shoots right back up and runs at Yussef kicking, until they're both entangled in the fight and end up rolling on the ground. Abdullah tries to get between them. \n98   EXT. HAMLET \"LOS LOBOS\" -- DAY \nDebbie and Mike are almost like spectators at a soccer match between the other kids, as they play in the dirt with an orange plastic ball. \nNobody passes to them.    Mike just runs from side to side without saying a word.    Frustrated, Debbie just watches. \n99    INT. HOUSE, HAMLET \"LOS LOBOS\" -- DAY \nnside the house, Amelia is checking on the food. \nAMELIA (All in Spanish) How many pots of rice did you make? \nDAUGHTER 1 I made two. \n109   EXT. CHICKEN COOP -- DAY \nSantiago and the other kids are plucking the chicken's feathers. Mike and Debbie stare, horrified. \nSANTIAGO (In Spanish) Aren't you going to help? \nMike and Debbie shake their heads. \nSANTIAGO (CONT'D) Why? \nMIKE It's not good to kill animals. \nSantiago smiles to himself. \nSANTIAGO (In English) Have you ever been to Kentucky Fried Chicken? \nThey both nod. \nSANTIAGO (CONT'D) What? Did you think that Colonel Sanders kept them as pets? \nHe hands Mike a headless chicken, and he slowly starts to pluck it. \n110   INT. PATRICIA'S ROOM -- DAY \nPatricia, in her bridal dress and clearly six months pregnant, is sitting on her bed with her hands around her belly, with her mother, father and entire family around her. \nPATRICIA (Both in Spanish) My belly's been hard since the morning. \nAMELIA That happens when you're nervous. \nMADRE D'you think the baby's coming? \nAMELIA There's no way the baby's coming; she's only six months pregnant. \nPATRICIA But my belly feels hard, really hard. \nAMELIA D'you want to get married? \nPATRICIA Yes. \nAMELIA Well, let's go then. \nMADRE And what if the baby comes out? \nAMELIA Well, we'll have the wedding and baptize the kid while we're at it. \n111   EXT. HAMLET -- DAY \nA bearded man (50) on an old bicycle rides down the hamlet's narrow streets. He is carrying a briefcase on the bike. \nHe is escorted by dozens of children. \n112   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nSusan is lying on the floor, moaning softly. Flies hover around the pool of blood under her neck. Richard, worried, strokes her hair. \nThe grandmother brings them a pot of tea with two cups and sets them on the floor beside them. \nRICHARD Thank you. \nThe grandmother goes to sit in a chair. Mohammed walks in and whispers something to him. Anwar turns to Richard. \nANWAR The doctor's here. \n113   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThe doctor walks across the patio, through the tumult of children and before the scrutiny of two police officers. \n114   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThe doctor enters the room. \nDOCTOR (In Arabic) Allah be with you. \nANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) Allah be with you. \nRichard just bows his head slightly. The doctor walks over to Susan, shoos the flies away and examines the wound. She looks at him, anxious. \nDOCTOR (In Arabic) The bullet didn't hit her spine or split her jugular. But it did shatter her clavicle and she could bleed to death. \nAnwar looks worried. \nRICHARD What did he say? \nANWAR He says she will be fine. \nRICHARD Stop lying to me god damn it, and tell me what the fuck he said! \nThe doctor addresses Richard in terrible English. \nDOCTOR Hospital... need hospital... \nRICHARD Yes, we know that. What can you do in the meantime? \nDOCTOR (In Arabic, to Anwar) Tell him I have to stitch up the wound to stop the bleeding. \nAnwar draws close to Richard and whispers. \nANWAR He has to sew up her wounds. \nSusan turns to look at them, suspicious. \nSUSAN What did he say? \nRichard gets nervous. \nSusan lies on the floor with her neck shoddily stitched and a splint on her shoulder made out of a few sticks and some dirty bandages. She moans in pain and mumbles curses. \nSUSAN I hate you... I hate you... \nShe tries to stand, but the doctor impedes it. \nDOCTOR (To Anwar in Arabic) Tell her not to move; the bullet's still inside. \nANWAR (To Susan) Don't move, miss. The bullet is still inside you. \nSUSAN I don't give a shit... \nRICHARD My love, don't move. \nSUSAN I want to call the kids. \nRICHARD You can't move, calm down. \nSUSAN I want to talk to them. \nRICHARD You can't; there's only one phone in town. I'll call them later. \nShe seems obsessed by the idea. \nSUSAN I want to talk to them... \nShe tries to stand again. As they struggle, the grandmother takes out a hash pipe form a drawer and lights it. She gives it two drags and squats next to Susan. \nShe shows her how to smoke it and hands it over. The old woman's serenity is such that Susan acquiesces. She takes four drags and slowly starts to relax. \nSusan smokes another three times, relaxes and closes her eyes. The old woman goes to get the clump of mud and starts to spread it on Susan's neck. Susan does not protest. Richard watches the scene in awe. \n117   EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThe bus is still parked outside Anwar's house. Some of the passengers sit leaning against the wall, scrutinized by some of the town's children and women who have offered them tea and dates. \n118   INT. BUS -- DAY \nThe driver sits in the driver's seat and stares out at the desolate landscape through the windshield. \nSeveral of the tourists nap in their seats. One of them, a French tourist, Robert (70), starts to breathe with difficulty. Jane (65), his wife, is alarmed. \nJANE (In French) Are you ok? \nRobert nods, but it is clear that he is not.    Jane shouts at the driver. \nJANE (CONT'D) (In French) Could you please turn on the air conditioning? \nThe driver shakes his head regretfully. \nDRIVER (In broken French) No air condition, no gasoline near. I'm sorry. \nRobert inhales, he can barely breathe. \nJANE (In French) My husband is feeling ill.     You have to turn it on. \nDRIVER (In French) No possible. No gasoline near.      I'm sorry. \nLILLY (In French) Please, it's too hot.   We can get dehydrated. \nDRIVER (In French) I'm really sorry, forgive me, but gasoline finish with air conditioner. \nTom turns to Jane. \nTOM What is he saying? \nJANE That he can't turn on the air conditioning, that it's not possible. \nTom stands up and goes to yell at the driver. \nTOM Fuck you.   We're gettin' out of here. \n119   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nTom resolutely walks up the stairs followed by James. \n120   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nRichard is looking out the window while Susan, relaxed, sleeps. Tom and James walk in making noise. \nTOM We've gotta talk to you. \nRichard, with his index finger, signals for him to shut up and points at Susan. He gestures for them to leave the room. \n121   EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nTom, James and others are gathered by the door. \nTOM We're leaving. \nRICHARD You can't leave us like this. \nTOM There are old people here and the heat is getting to them. \nRICHARD At least wait until an ambulance comes. \nTOM One man almost fainted in the bus and there's a woman who needs to get back in time to take her medication. \nRichard turns to Anwar. \nRICHARD Is there anyone around here who can take them in? \nTOM It's not about that. \nLILLY Sir, we can't wait anymore. \nThe doorman picks up a cordless phone and dials. \nDOORMAN (CONT'D) Lieutenant Kenji Mamiya, please? \nThere is a pause. The doorman gestures to Chieko that the lieutenant will answer in a moment. \nDOORMAN (CONT'D) Lieutenant? Yes, look, I'm with the deaf-mute girl you saw in the afternoon, and she asked me to call you... Yes, her... She says she needs to talk to you, alone... about her father... If it's possible, in her apartment, tonight. \nChieko watches attentively. \n129   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY \nYussef and Ahmed are sitting against the wall of the house. Yussef's lip is split. Ahmed's nose is bleeding. \nAbdullah paces desperately, while his wife and daughters watch the scene, silent. Abdullah stops to look at Yussef. \nABDULLAH Why did you do this? \nThey don't answer.   Abdullah leans over and slaps Ahmed. \nABDULLAH (CONT'D) Answer me, god damn it! \nAhmed won't answer and he turns to Yussef again. \nYUSSEF We were testing the rifle. \nAbdullah turns and gives Yussef a powerful slap, which he endures with silent dignity. \nABDULLAH Are you idiots? You killed a woman, (He turns to Zora) And you, you got naked so your brother would see you? \nAHMED Yes, she got naked lots of times.    I saw how Yussef spied on her. \nZORA That's not true. \nAbdullah turns to Yussef. \nABDULLAH Is it true or not? \nYussef is silent. Abdullah walks two steps forward and slaps Zora. He looks furious, scared, indignant. \nABDULLAH (CONT'D) Why did you do this to us? \nHe can barely hold in his tears. Zora brings her hand to her face tearily. Abdullah turns to Ahmed. \nABDULLAH (CONT'D) Where's the rifle? \n130   EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- DAY \nA cop interrogates Hassan. His face is badly bruised and his hands are cuffed behind his back. \nCOP What organization gave you the weapon? \nHASSAN I've told you it wasn't an organization; I got it from a hunter. \nCOP What hunter? \nHASSAN A Japanese hunter gave it to me many years ago. I've got a picture inside. She can get it. \nHe turns to look at his wife. She has also been beaten and is guarded by two cops. The interrogating cop authorizes her. She walks in and comes out with a photograph of Hassan with Yasujiro, posing with the scimitar-horned oryx. He hands it over and the cop examines it. \nHASSAN (CONT'D) He's holding the rifle he gave me. \n131   EXT. DESERT -- DAY \nYussef and Ahmed dig up the rifle and the bullets in front of their parents and sisters. \nAbdullah grabs the rifle, dusts it off and puts the bullets in his bag. He turns to Yasira. \nABDULLAH We're going to hide out at Naguib's house. If the cops come, tell them we went south. \nWith the rifle in hand, Abdullah runs off, followed by Yussef and Ahmed. The women watch them get lost on the horizon. \n132   EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- DAY \nAlarid's truck parks in front of Hassan's house again. Hassan is still cuffed and being interrogated. Furious, Alarid gets out of the truck and goes toward him. \nALARID This Abdullah doesn't live where you said he did. \nHe walks over to kick him. The wife intervenes from where she is, some ten yards away. \nWIFE They live where he said they do. \nAlarid turns to her. \nALARID You're going to take us. \nWith a gesture, he orders his subordinates to put her in the truck. She obeys, docile. \nALARID (CONT'D) And if they're not there, I'll cut your tongue out and I'll kill your husband. \n133   EXT. DESERT -- DAY \nThe Moroccan police trucks drive down the dusty roads.    The landscape is harsh and barren. \n134   INT. POLICE TRUCK -- DAY \nHassan's wife gives directions. \nWIFE Make a right here. \nAlarid, with his hand, signals the driver to follow her directions. \nSuddenly, in the distance, over the hills, she signals three tiny dots running up a slope. \nWIFE (CONT'D) That's them. \nA cowboy pulls out a gun and, festively, fires.   Debbie is frightened and goes to hide behind Amelia. \nAMELIA Don't worry, it's ok. \nThe man puts the gun away and walks back onto the dance floor as if nothing had happened. \nLuis asks the band to stop the music for a little bit and he takes the microphone. \nLUIS Good evening everyone... Hey... I want to say something. Love came today, it came here all pretty... (he taps his heart) It's kind of like a little mouse is crawling inside of me. Because that's what love is, it's like your insides get all twisted into knots... and that, baby, is what you've taught me. And because you've shown me, I want to tell everyone that hopefully love will get inside them too...because it feels so good, really...Thanks a lot and keep havin' a good time... \nEverybody applauds and Luis steps down from the dais, proud of his speech. He goes to Amelia and gives her a very long and loving hug. \n142   EXT. HAMLET \"LOS LOBOS\" -- NIGHT \nNight has fallen. The music plays full blast. Everyone dances, people start to make out, the drunk collapse. \nPatricia breathes regularly with her hands on her belly. Luis drinks beer beside her while he watches the guests dance. Debbie falls asleep on Amelia's lap while Mike watches the party, overwhelmed. \nMIKE When are my parents getting back? \nThe question catches Amelia off guard. \nAMELIA Pronto...muy pronto... \nMIKE They told me they were coming back today. \nAMELIA Se quedaron m\u00e1s rato. \nThe answer seem to makes Mike anxious. \nMIKE My dad's coming back with my mom. \nAMELIA Yes. Yes he is. \nMIKE I don't want him to leave again. \nAMELIA He won't. \nHe starts crying. \nMIKE I miss Pat. \nAmelia embraces him and kisses his head. \nAMELIA Yo tambi\u00e9n hijito, yo tambi\u00e9n. \nThe boy, tired and sleepy, leans his head on Amelia. \n143   EXT. HAMLET \"LOS LOBOS\" -- NIGHT \nSantiago, a little bit drunk, and Amelia, carrying Debbie who has passed out, say goodbye to Luis and Patricia. Sleepy, Mike leans on the hood of the car. \nLUIS (All in Spanish) Stay the night. \nAMELIA I can't. I have to take these kids home and it's almost dawn. \nLUIS But Santiago's pretty drunk. \nSANTIAGO Drunk my ass. I'm fine. I'll go and come back in an hour. \nPATRICIA Stay for another while, the party's just getting started. \nAMELIA I wish, but these kids have to go to school. \nSantiago opens the door for Amelia, who carefully sets Debbie on the back seat. Mike gets in and as soon as he does he nestles in to go to sleep. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) See you soon, son. \nLuis and Amelia hug each other.    Then Amelia hugs her daughter- in-law. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Congratulations, dear. (She points at her belly) Take care of my grandson 'cause I'm dying to be a grandmother. \nShe gives her a kiss and gets in the car.   Luis turns to Santiago. \nLUIS You sure you're not too drunk? \nSANTIAGO Drunk my ass. I'm fine.     I'll be back soon. \nSantiago stumbles to the driver's side and opens the door. \n144   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- NIGHT \nThe night spreads over the highway that cuts across the desert. Santiago's car drives along, illuminating the cacti. \n145   INT. SANTIAGO'S CAR -- NIGHT \nSantiago drives the car, nodding off every now and then. In the back, Debbie and Mike have surrendered to sleep. Santiago jerks the wheel. \nAMELIA (In Spanish) Hey... be careful... \nSantiago corrects the vehicles trajectory and goes back to his careless driving. \n146   EXT. BORDER CROSSING -- NIGHT \nSantiago decides to cross through Mesa de Otay. Since it's nighttime, there are very few cars. They drive across the bridge and stop before the immigration officer. \n147   EXT. IMMIGRATION STALL, BORDER CROSSING -- CONTINUOUS \nThe officer walks up to the window. \nOFFICER Your papers... \nSantiago and Amelia take out their passports and their Green cards. The officer compares the documents to their faces again and again. \nOFFICER (CONT'D) Where you comin' from? \nRICHARD Where the fuck do you want me to take her? \nJAMES Try to understand, many of them can't go on. Tell me, honestly, is there any point in us staying? \nRichard threatens him. \nRICHARD You leave and I'll kill you... \nJames is going to say something, but Richard turns around and walks away as he is about to say something. Anwar follows. \n159   INT. GENERAL STORE -- EVENING \nRichard is in the phone booth with telephone in hand. A woman's voice answers. \nRACHEL (O.S.) Hello... \nRICHARD Rachel... What's going on? Nobody's come... Who have you talked to... we need help...she's dying... \nRACHEL (O.S.) What d'you mean dying? \nRICHARD She's very weak, please, you've got to do something. \nRACHEL (O.S.) Mark, your business partner, already called someone in the Secretary of State, they're going to help you... \nRICHARD You can't just make these stupid fucking calls, you've got to do something... \nRACHEL (O.S.) Richard calm down, we're doing everything we can. \nRICHARD How the fuck do you expect me to calm down? Susan is dying... \nRACHEL (O.S.) I'm flying over there tonight. \nRICHARD There's no time. I need to get Susan out of here now! Put Mark on the phone... \nRACHEL (O.S.) I don't know if I can find him. \nRICHARD God damn it, connect the fucking call. \nA few seconds go by. Desperate, Richard looks at the town as it goes about its daily business, oblivious to his tragedy. \nMARK (O.S.) Richard, it's Mark. \nRICHARD Mark, help me... Susan is dying and there are no ambulances, there's no hospital, there's nothing. \nMARK (O.S.) Richard, the news is all over the place. They're going to go help you, soon, but there have been some political problems that are being resolved. \nRICHARD I don't give a shit about political problems... Do something, now, please... \nThrough the window, Richard, astonished, watches the bus drive away, kicking up dust as it disappears in the distance. \nRICHARD (CONT'D) Son of a bitch... \nHe throws the phone away and runs after the bus. We hear Mark's desperate voice over the receiver. \nMARK (O.S.) Richard... what happened? Richard, answer me... \n160   EXT. HAMLET -- EVENING \nRichard runs after the bus as it drives away down the side streets. \nRICHARD Stop... Stop... Stop you mother- fuckers stop... \nThe bus vanishes into the distance. Richard picks up a stone and hurls it impotently. \n161   INT. CHIEKO'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nChieko is in her room, sitting on her bed, staring into space. The doorbell light goes on. She remains motionless for a few moments. The light goes on again. Chieko breathes in and goes to open the door. \n162   INT. ENTRANCE TO CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nChieko opens the door and runs into Kenji, who greets her as if she were just anybody. \nKENJI Hello. \nShe bows. \nKENJI (CONT'D) They told me you wanted to talk to me. \nChieko, who has been unable to read his lips, asks him with her hands that he speak slowly and face her. Kenji is embarrassed by his tactlessness and tries to be more considerate. \nKENJI (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Is there something you wanted to tell me? \nChieko nods and asks him in with her hand. Kenji takes off his shoes and leaves them at the door. Chieko leads him to the living room and with a gesture asks if he wants anything to drink. \nKENJI (CONT'D) Do you have tea? \nChieko nods and goes into the kitchen. Kenji glances over the apartment. Chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a strange gadget which she puts on the living room table. A small bulb lights. Kenji just watches her. \nChieko gestures for him to sit down.     Kenji and Chieko sit across from each other. \nChieko takes out her notebook and pen, writes something down and hands it over to Kenji. Kenji reads, seems surprised and reads again slowly. \nKENJI (CONT'D) \"My father had nothing to do with my mother's death,\" what's this? \nChieko is disconcerted at the question. She takes her notebook and starts writing. Kenji reads and turns to her. \nKENJI (CONT'D) Your father was asleep when she jumped off the balcony? \nShe nods. She gets up, asks Kenji to go with her and walks toward the balcony. \n163   EXT. BALCONY, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nShe opens the door to the balcony and points at the void: it's over twelve floors. Kenji looks over; the distance is dizzying. Chieko writes in her notebook and shows him the piece of paper. \nKENJI You saw her jump? \nABDULLAH (CONT'D) Ahmed!   Ahmed! \nHe rolls Ahmed over and lays his head on his lap. Abdullah cannot stop crying. Yussef, ducking, runs toward his brother. Abdullah laments nervously. \nABDULLAH (CONT'D) Don't die, don't die. \nYussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother. He stands up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not, he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks. \nWhen he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks toward the police. One of them policemen looks at him through a pair of binoculars. Alarid interrogates him. \nALARID What's happening? \nPOLICE OFFICER A boy is walking this way. \nALARID Is he armed? \nThe officer takes a careful look. \nPOLICE OFFICER It doesn't look like it. \nALARID What are the others doing? \nThe officer watches Abdullah carrying his wounded son. \nPOLICE OFFICER A man is holding somebody injured. \nALARID Is the other one still walking this way? \nPOLICE OFFICER Yes. \nAlarid turns to the other officers. \nALARID Aim. \nThe police aim and hold Yussef in their sights. He keeps walking resolutely toward his aggressors. He is crying softly, keeping his arms open. \nYussef walks until his is 10 meters away from the police and he kneels with his arms open. \nYUSSEF I killed the American, I was the only one who shot at you... \nCautious, the police still aim at his chest. Yussef proceeds with his confession, babbling it through his nerves, his pain and his attempt to control his sobbing. \nYUSSEF (CONT'D) They did nothing... nothing... \nHe turns to his father and his brother and points at them. \nYUSSEF (CONT'D) Kill me, but save my brother, he did nothing... nothing... \nAlarid moves in, aiming at him with a rifle.    Behind him are five other cops, also ready to shoot. \nALARID On the ground... \nYussef does not obey. \nYUSSEF Save my brother... \nALARID On the ground... \nYussef turns his face toward Alarid looks him in the eye. \nYUSSEF Save my brother... please... \nHe lies on the floor, crying. Alarid puts his gun down and looks at him: his enemy is a disconsolate child. Then he looks up at Abdullah who is screaming his lamentations. He turns to one of his subordinates. \nALARID Go help them. \nOne of the officers goes to help Abdullah and Ahmed.     Yussef lies on the floor, crying. \n166   EXT. DESERT -- NIGHT \nThe sun rises.   Amelia and the children keep walking.    They sweat. \nMIKE I can't walk anymore. \nAMELIA We have to keep walking. \nMIKE Why is the air so hot? \nAmelia stops and tries to distract them. \nAMELIA (the entire dialogue in English) Because coyotes and snakes and quails have already breathed that air. \nMike remains pensive. \nMIKE We're breathing the same air animals breathe? \nAMELIA Yes. \nMIKE And it doesn't rot? \nAMELIA No, it doesn't rot.   We all breathe this air. \n167   EXT. DESERT -- MORNING \nDawn. The three walk through the desert.      Debbie walks mechanically, tired and exhausted. \nDEBBIE I can't anymore. I'm thirsty. \nMIKE So am I. \nAmelia looks around her: no sign of civilization. \nAMELIA (In Spanish) Just a little further and we'll go look for water. \n168   EXT. DESERT -- LATER \nAMELIA (CONT'D) I have to go get two kids I left behind in the desert. \nJohn looks at her suspiciously. \nJOHN (In Spanish, with a terrible accent) Are they illegal immigrants? \nAMELIA No, they're American. \nJOHN When did you cross? \nAMELIA (In English) I didn't cross, I live here.   Please, help me find these kids. \nJohn keeps staring at her.   He points to a mesquite. \nJOHN Stand there and don't move. \nAmelia obeys. John goes back to the vehicle, opens the door and sits down and grabs the radio. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Attention base, I have a 4533...I have the suspect. \nAmelia doesn't manage to hear what the radio says. She looks attentively at what the agent is doing. John stops and runs back to her. \nJOHN (CONT'D) You're under arrest. Turn around and put your hands behind your head. \nAmelia despairs. \nAMELIA I left those kids in the desert, I swear. \nJohn pushes her forcefully against the truck. \nJOHN Turn around, now. \nShe turns around with her hands over her head.    John handcuffs her and leads her to the vehicle. \n176   INT. BORDER PATROL VEHICLE -- DAY \nAmelia, cuffed, and John, drive down a path in the desert. \nJOHN Which way are they? \nAmelia studies the terrain.    She points at some mesquites in the distance. \nAMELIA (In Spanish) Over there. \n177   EXT. DESERT -- DAY \nThe truck parks and they both get out. \nJOHN Where are they? \nAmelia explores the landscape, anguished. \nAMELIA They must be around here. \nAnother border patrol truck arrives and pulls up next to them. Eliseo (34), looks out the window. \nELISEO What happened? \nJOHN This lady said they were here, but there's nobody. \nELISEO (In Spanish) Ma'am, you're not lying to us, are you? \nAMELIA (In Spanish) I swear they're around here somewhere. \nShe sees another cluster of mesquites and points toward them. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) They must be over that way. \n178   EXT. CLUSTER OF MESQUITES -- DAY \nThey arrive at the cluster. The two trucks park and the three get out. She is still cuffed. A helicopter hovers above them. \nThey walk around: nothing. \nJOHN There's nobody here. \nAMELIA (To Eliseo, in Spanish) I left them about a kilometer in from the road. \nELISEO (In Spanish) Which road? \nShe doesn't know what to say.    John grabs her by the arm and drags her toward the vehicle. \nJOHN I don't believe you. \nAmelia looks at him desperately. \nAMELIA (In English) I swear they're around here. \nJohn is not affected.   He keeps pulling her. \nELISEO (In English) John, wait, maybe she's telling the truth. \nJOHN Maybe she's not, let's go. \nAMELIA Please sir, believe me. \nJohn pays no attention.   She turns to Eliseo. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) (In Spanish) I swear, they're lost, they're going to die. I have to find them. \nJohn keeps pulling her. He puts her in the truck and closes the door before Eliseo's passive gaze. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) (In English) Please no... please... \n179   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON \nHe pulls away from Ken and follows Susan toward the E.R. \n192   INT. HALLWAY, E.R., MOROCCAN HOSPITAL -- NIGHT \nSeveral Moroccan doctors are examining Susan.    Richard observes worriedly from a window. \nOne of the doctors comes out. \nMOROCCAN DOCTOR (In good English) We're going to have to operate immediately. \nRICHARD Is she going to be ok? \nMOROCCAN DOCTOR It's probable. We're going to try to save her arm.   She's been bleeding internally, and there's been some clotting so there's a high risk of gangrene. \nRICHARD (insistently, as if he hadn't heard the doctor) But she's going to be ok? \nThe Moroccan doctor puts his hand on Richard's shoulder and thinks about his answer. \nMOROCCAN DOCTOR Yes, she's going to be ok. \nThe doctor leaves and Richard goes back to looking at his wife through the glass. \nThe doctors are still prepping her.   Richard walks in. \n193   INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT \nHe stands next to Susan, who is unconscious. He looks at a doctor and she moves to one side. Richard leans over and kisses her. \nHe walks away and the nurses start to wheel her to the O.R. \n194   INT. HALLWAY, MOROCCAN HOSPITAL -- NIGHT \nRichard is talking on the phone from an office. \nRICHARD Amelia? \nAMELIA (O.S.) Yes sir. \nRICHARD How is everything? \nAMELIA (O.S.) Ok sir, Mrs. Rachel told me. I'm very sorry. How is Mrs. Susan? \nRICHARD They're going to operate now... Amelia... take good care of the kids, and don't tell them anything... \nAMELIA (O.S.) No sir, don't worry. \nRICHARD Put Mike on please. \nA few seconds pass and Mike answers.   This is the phone call from the beginning. \nMIKE (O.S.) Hi dad. \nRICHARD Hey sweetie, how are you? \nMIKE (O.S.) Dad, guess what? Today, at school, they brought some baby chickens. \nRICHARD Oh really? \nMIKE (O.S.) I held one in my hand. He was really little and he was all warm. \nRichard starts to cry for the first time. \nMIKE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Dad, are you ok? \nRichard tries to hold back his sobbing. \nRICHARD Yeah, I'm ok. Everything's fine. \nThe boy keeps talking while Richard cries. \nMIKE (O.S.) And Mariana wanted to take one home, but the teacher didn't let her... \n195   INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nChieko, naked, sits in an armchair, again submerged in the remote world of her silence. Before her, Kenji observes her nakedness, her sadness, her pained beauty. \nFor a while they remain motionless. She seems to return from the long journey to herself and turns to look at him. Their eyes meet. There are still tears in Chieko's eyes. They hold each other's gaze until Chieko gets up, gets her notebook, scribbles down some words and gives them to him. \nKenji reads them and looks at her. \nKENJI You don't have to apologize for anything. \nShe sits down beside him. They look at each other again for a few, long seconds. Chieko takes his hand, strokes it for a moment, kisses it, sucks one of his fingers and then puts it back in its place. \nShe grabs her notebook and starts writing a long note. It takes her almost a minute to do so. Kenji, nervous because of her proximity, watches her write feverishly. \nChieko finishes writing, folds the note and hands it to Kenji. Kenji starts unfolding it, but Chieko stops him. She takes it away from him, folds it again and puts it in his breast pocket. She signals for him to read it later. \nKenji gets up to go. She stands next to him. Her nakedness contrasts with Kenji's toughness. He bows his head to say goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass. Kenji walks past her as she watches. \nKenji reaches the door. He opens it and turns to look at Chieko again, who has been left in the middle of the hall. He bows his head again and leaves. \nChieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully. \n196   INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHT \nKenji rides the elevator down, touched, barely able to contain his emotion. The elevator doors open and he walks out. \n197   INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT \nKenji walks past the doorman. \nKENJI Good night. \nHe keeps walking. On the other end of the lobby, at the parking lot entrance, Yasujiro walks in. \n", "test1_input": "AHMED Yeah, but that's not three kilometers. \nAhmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the top of the hill. Once at the top, he looks around for a moment and then calls his brother. \nAHMED (CONT'D) Yussef, come here. \nYussef climbs the slope. Ahmed signals a road that in the distance cuts across the great desert plain, and points out a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead. \nAHMED (CONT'D) I bet you the bullet can't hit that far away. \nAhmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign.    He fires and nothing. \nAHMED (CONT'D) These fucking bullets aren't any good. \nYUSSEF You're not aiming right. \nYussef points at a yellow car driving along the road. \nYUSSEF (CONT'D) What'll you give me if I hit that car? \nAHMED I'll shoot. \nAhmed reloads. The empty cartridge falls to the ground. He fires again - the car keeps going. Yussef asks for the rifle. \nAHMED (CONT'D) You see?    Nothing happens. \nYUSSEF Let me shoot. \nHe also drops the used cartridge on the ground, reloads and shoots the traffic sign. He fires and nothing. \nAHMED I told you.    Hassan's a liar. \nA bus approaches.    Ahmed points at it. \nAHMED (CONT'D) Shoot at that one... \nYussef loads the rifle parsimoniously, shuts the chamber, raises the weapon, aims and fires. \nThe bus drives on.    Ahmed turns to his brother. \nAHMED (CONT'D) See: nothing. \nThe bus drives on another three hundred yards and suddenly stops in the middle of the road. \n13   INT. T.V. ROOM, L.A. HOUSE -- NIGHT \nAmelia (54), a maternal, Mexican woman with a pleasant face, is playing Monopoly with Debbie (4) and Mike (5).

They are both lying in bed. Amelia sits next to them. \nAMELIA (In Spanish) Did you brush your teeth? \nMike shows her his teeth so she can see he did. \nMIKE Will you tell us a story? \nAMELIA One and then you're going to sleep. \nBoth children nod. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) (Her entire story in Spanish) Once there was a hawk who wanted to fly higher than everyone else. He trained every day and hunted little birds so he could eat them and be strong. \nMIKE Pajaritos?     Little birds? \nAMELIA Of course, that's what hawks eat. So, one day the hawk flew so, so high that it crashed into an airplane. It fainted and started to fall. And when it was about to hit the ground, all the birds flew toward him and saved him. \nDEBBIE They saved him? \nAMELIA Yes, and when the hawk was healthy again he went to talk to the birds and said: I want to thank you for saving me, but I can't change and I'm going to keep hunting you. The little birds answered: we don't care that you hunt us, because that's who you are. But we will always save you, because that's who we are. \nThe children are silent. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) (In English) Did you like it? \nDEBBIE No. \nAmelia moves to turn out the light. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Leave it on. \nAmelia stands still beside the switch. \nAMELIA Quedamos en que se iban a dormir con la luz apagada. \nDEBBIE But I'm scared. \nAMELIA No pasa nada. \n", "test1_true": "Amelia sits down next to her and caresses her. \nAMELIA A ti no te va a pasar eso... \nDEBBIE Pat died while she was sleeping. \nAMELIA That only happens to some babies when they're really little. \nMIKE Then why did daddy get so angry at mommy? \nAMELIA He wasn't angry, he was just very sad. \nDEBBIE He left. \nAmelia doesn't know what else to say. She pats Debbie's head. \nAMELIA Go to sleep. I'll sit here with you, but you can't talk anymore. \nThey both nod and snuggle under their blankets. Amelia watches them silently. \n15   INT.

HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nAmelia enters the kitchen and answers a wall phone. \nAMELIA Yes... \nRICHARD (O.S.) Amelia, it's Richard. We're going to have to be here a few more days here in Morocco than we expected and Rachel wasn't able to find anyone to take care of the kids. \nAMELIA Your sister-in-law promised me to find someone. \nRICHARD (O.S.) Amelia, this is very serious. \nAmelia looks worried. \nAMELIA It's because... I told Mrs. Jones three months ago that today is my son's wedding. \nRICHARD (O.S.) Amelia, this is an emergency. Cancel your son's wedding. I'll pay for another one. \nAMELIA Sir, everything is ready. Can't anyone come take care of the kids? It's just one day. \nRICHARD (O.S.) We need you, Amelia... hold on. \nRichard stops talking. We hear voices in the background. \nRICHARD (O.S.) (CONT'D) Amelia, we're really counting on you. I have to go. Goodbye. \nHe hangs up.   Amelia stares into empty space. \n17   INT. KITCHEN, L.A. HOUSE -- DAY \nDebbie (4) and Mike (5) are having breakfast while Amelia leans on the sink and looks at them, overwhelmed. \nAMELIA (To Debbie, in Spanish) Do you want another quesadilla? \nDEBBIE Mhh. \nAmelia turns around to warm up a tortilla. Mike stops eating his cereal and looks at her. \nMIKE How many little birds did the hawk eat? \nAmelia turns around and sees Mike, who is truly worried. \nAMELIA (In English) None, because he started to like quesadillas. \nAmelia strokes his hair. A car horn honks. Amelia looks out and sees a school bus parked outside the house. \nDEBBIE Is the bus here? \nAMELIA (In Spanish) Yes, but today you're not going to school. \nDEBBIE Why? \nAMELIA We have things to do. \nAmelia turns around and walks out to the street. Through the door we can see her saying something to the bus driver. The school bus leaves and Amelia walks back into the house. \n18   INT. T.V. ROOM, L.A. HOUSE -- DAY \nDebbie and Mike are watching cartoons while Amelia talks on the phone. \nAMELIA (Both in Spanish) I just want you to take of them for today. \nWOMAN (O.S.)

Santiago closes the doors and drives off in a cloud of dust. \nThey start to walk through the darkness. Amelia leads the way, avoiding cacti and thorny branches. The go on like this for a long stretch. The children are quiet and scared. \nAmelia goes toward the highway and realizes the patrol cars have turned into the path. She runs into the desert with the kids. She can barely see with the light of the early dawn. The three frequently trip on thorny plants. \nDEBBIE I want to go home now. \nMIKE Me too. \nBoth of them, scared, start to cry. \nAMELIA (In English) Don't cry. We're going home now. \nShe looks back worried at where the patrol cars were; they are approaching quickly. Then she turns to where Santiago ran. The headlights are soon lost on the horizon. \nAmelia holds them by the hand and pulls them as she runs. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) (In Spanish) Let's go. \nShe leads them further and further away from the path, snaking through the brush. The patrol cars come even closer. Amelia ducks and hides behind one of the bushes. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Get down. \nThe children hide with her. The patrol cars tear past her, some five hundred yards away, chasing after Santiago. \nWe suddenly hear sirens.

It's your shitty fucking country's responsibility. \nPOLICEMAN (In Arabic) The Americans want to send one of their helicopters but I think there are some problems. \nAnwar mulls over his answer.   He seems to want to lie again. \nANWAR They're going to try to send a helicopter. \nRICHARD (incredulous) A helicopter?... Let's get out of here... \nHe starts walking. Anwar catches up to him. \nANWAR Where? \nRichard turns to him, desperate. \nRICHARD I need to make a phone call. \nThey turn towards the exit leaving the cop behind, who doesn't seem to understand. Tom and James take advantage of the situation to go talk to Richard. \nTOM We can't stay here any longer. It's going to get dark soon.

ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nRichard and the vet carry Susan out on a wheelbarrow. It is very difficult to move her. She is clearly in pain and groans quietly. \nOutside the house is the policeman with his Peugeot. Anwar is talking to him. \nRichard and the vet carry Susan all the way to the car. Richard stands before the policeman he humiliated earlier. \nRICHARD Thank you for lending us the car. \nAnwar translates. \nANWAR (In Arabic) He thanks you for lending us the car. \nThe policeman nods kindly. \nDozens of girls and boys and a few adults stare at the scene. \nGingerly, Richard, Anwar and the vet lift her into the car and softly lay her on the back seat. \nEven so, she screams in pain. \nSUSAN Ahhh...

You took them to another country without their parents' permission and you put them in danger. \nAMELIA Sir, I raised these kids since they were born. I take care of them day and night.

Mike and Debbie are like my own children. \nPOLICE OFFICER (sternly) But they are not your kids, ma'am. \nAMELIA What about my nephew, Santiago? \nPOLICE OFFICER I don't have any information on him. \nAmelia looks destitute. \nPOLICE OFFICER (CONT'D) We located the parents in Morocco. They're very angry, but they've decided not to raise charges. \nAmelia exhales, relieved.   The policeman leans toward her. \nPOLICE OFFICER (CONT'D) Nevertheless, the government of the United States has deemed you were seriously breaking the law and has decided to immediately and definitively deport you. \nAmelia loses her breath. \nAMELIA I've been living here for fifteen years.

Richard and Susan wait in the back while the boy, Anwar and the vet lean on the hood. \nSuddenly a helicopter with American insignia flies over them and goes to land in an empty lot. \nAnwar looks up and watches the helicopter descend. The helicopter kicks up a cloud of dust before the stunned gaze of dozens of children. Some camels are frightened. Some starving dogs bark at it. \n189   EXT.

Anwar catches up to them to say goodbye. \nANWAR Good luck, mister... \nRICHARD Thank you for everything. \nRichard gives Anwar a hug which he responds to affectionately.

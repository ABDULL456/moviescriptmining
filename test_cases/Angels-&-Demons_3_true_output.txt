ROCHER The Camerlengo? He's just a priest here, the former Pope's Chamberlain. 
LANGDON Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest with him during tempe sede vacante? 
They just stare at him. Shit, this guy's good. Langdon checks his watch, getting irritated. 
LANGDON (cont'd) Hey, fellas --- you called me. 
CUT TO: 
INT     PAPAL OFFICES      DAY 
A spectacular view of St. Peter's Square, through the windows of the Papal offices.    Moving down, we find a figure dressed in a simple black cassock, his back to us, staring out at the crowd. FATHER SEBASTIAN GUTTIEREZ, the Camerlengo, speaks with a soft Spanish accent. 
CAMERLENGO His Holiness once told me that a Pope is a man torn between two worlds... the real world and the divine. 
Assembled in the grand office are Langdon, Rocher, Olivetti, and Vittoria.    The Camerlengo's back is still turned. 
CAMERLENGO (cont'd) He warned that any church that ignored reality would not survive to enjoy the divine. 
He turns around.    He's younger than we thought, in his mid- thirties, deep, dark eyes.    The kind of priest who often inspires, before the years of dogma catch up with him. 
CAMERLENGO (cont'd) It seems the real world is upon us tonight. (to Langdon) I'm familiar with llluminati lore, and the legend of the brandings.    La Purga is a dark stain on the church's history; I'm not surprised this ghost has come back to haunt us. 
He sits behind the massive desk, and if he seemed young before, he seems like a child now, overcome by the position he's in.    But when he speaks to Rocher, he's in command. 
CAMERLENGO (cont'd) Commandante, have you begun a search for this explosive device? 
ROCHER Of course, but it could be anywhere, and the safety of the cardinals is my primary concern at the moment. 
CAMERLENGO The Sistine Chapel is a fortress, as long as the cardinals are in conclave, your security concerns are at a minimum.    Devote as much of your resources as possible to a search for- 
ROCHER Signore, if you're about to suggest we make a naked-eye search of all of Vatican City, I must- 
CAMERLENGO (SHARPLY) Commander.    Though I am not His Holiness, when you address me, you are addressing this office.    Do you understand? 
ROCHER Yes, Padre, 
CAMERLENGO Good.    Now -- you said the image on screen was illuminated by artificial light.    May I suggest methodically cutting the power to various sections of the City.     When the image on your screen goes dark, you'll have a more specific idea of the device's location. 
Rocher looks at Olivetti -- gotta admit, that's a pretty damn good idea. 
CAMERLENGO (cont'd) Ms. Vetra.    Besides yourself and your research partner, who knew about your antimatter project? 
VITTORIA Only the director of CERN.    But Leonardo kept detailed journals; if he told anyone else about what we were doing, he would have made a note of it. 
CAMERLENGO (PAUSE) Do you have these journals? 
VITTORIA I can have them flown here from Geneva in an hour. 
He pauses, thinking, then turns the phone on his desk to face her. While she picks it up to dial, the Camerlengo comes around his desk to speak privately to Langdon. 
CAMERLENGO Mr. Langdon.    You're correct that I may grant you access to the Archives. 
LANGDON Thank you, Padre. 
CAMERLENGO I said you're correct that I may, not that I will.     Christianity's most sacred codices are in that archive. Given your recent entanglement with the church -- I need to ask you a question first. 
Langdon looks at him -- fire away. 
CAMERLENGO (cont'd) Do you believe in God, sir? 
LANGDON (DELICATELY) Father, I simply believe that religions can often- 
CAMERLENGO I didn't ask if you believe what man says about God, I asked if you believe in God. 
LANGDON I'm an academic. My mind tells me I will never understand God. 
CAMERLENGO And your heart? 
LANGDON Tells me I'm not meant to. 
The Camerlengo looks at him -- that's not quite good enough. 
LANGDON (cont'd) I believe that faith is a gift, which I have not been fortunate enough to receive. 
The Camerlengo looks at him for a long moment. Pretty damn good answer.    He puts a hand on Langdon's shoulder and leans in. 
CAMERLENGO Be delicate with our treasures. 
CUT TO: 
EXT     APOSTOLIC PALACE       DAY 
The back doors of the Apostolic Palace BANG open and Langdon is ushered out (fast) by Olivetti, the head of the Vatican Police. 
OLIVETTI The archives are this way. 
They turn down a narrow passageway. A VOICE calls from behind them. 
VITTORIA (O.S.) Professor Langdon! 
Vittoria catches up to them. 
VITTORIA (cont'd) If this path really leads to the Church of Illumination, that may be where they've hidden the antimatter. 
LANGDON "A shining star at the end of the Path."    My thoughts exactly. 
OLIVETTI (to Vittoria) If we find this bomb, can you deactivate it? 
VITTORIA No, but I can change its battery, as long as it has more than five minutes of life.    That would give us another twenty-four hours to get it back to CERN.

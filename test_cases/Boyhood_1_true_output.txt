Mason holds the shotgun, taking aim. Grandpa Cliff throws a chunk of wood up into the air as a target. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Ready?   Pull! 
Mason misses the fist shot. 
GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D) You uh, you uh, hit a little low. Wait until it gets up high and then shoot. Alright? Cause then it's a better aim coming down. Remember, second trigger. 
MASON Mm-hm. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Ready? 
MASON Mm-hm. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Pull! 
Grandpa Cliff throws another piece of wood into the air. This time, Mason hits it. 
GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D) Hah! Hah! Look what you did! Well, you nailed it, didn't you? How's that feel? 
MASON Felt good. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Yeah, it felt good. Good. 
EXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 
The family sits out on the porch in a circle.   Dad plays guitar as the family sings along. 
DAD (singing) Well, I want for us to be together forever. 
ANNIE (singing) But to wander wherever I may. 
DAD (singing) I want you to be easy and casual. 
ANNIE (singing) But still demand I stay. 
SAMANTHA (singing) I want for you to know me completely, but still remain mysterious. 
MASON (singing) Consider everything deeply, but still remain fearless. 
DAD AND ANNIE (singing) Climb to the top, look over the ledge. Dance barefoot on a razor's edge. Reach for the stars, grab the tiger by the tail. 
MASON (singing) If I don't try, I'll never fail. 
DAD Good! 
DAD AND ANNIE (singing) If you go home, you're rolling the dice. Can't step in the same river twice. If you love too much it'll turn to hate. If you never leave home you'll never be late. If you eat too much, you're gonna get fat. If you buy a dog, you'll piss off your cat. 
Grandpa Cliff and Nana both laugh. 
DAD AND ANNIE (CONT'D) Take a deep breath, and enjoy the ride. Cause arrivals and departures run side by side... 
Annie's parents cheer as the song concludes. 
DAD (O.S.) Alright, you're our first audience, you know? Mason demanded we work on it the whole drive. 
GRANDPA CLIFF It was really wonderful. That's sweet. Sweet. 
NANA Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Impressive. 
DAD It's a work in progress. 
EXT. CHURCH - DAY 
A small country church. 
PREACHER (O.S.) A week later -- we don't know why Thomas wasn't there the first time -- but a week later, Thomas comes back and joins the other disciples. They say, "Hey, the Lord's alive, we saw him!" 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
The preacher stands at the front of the church holding an open bible. The family sits among the congregation. Mason is wearing his new suit. 
PREACHER "I won't believe it until I put my finger into his side and I'm gonna see those nail prints in his hands." Poof! About that time, here comes Jesus, standing right next to him. Okay? And he turns to Thomas. Don't you know Thomas felt some shame? And he turns to Thomas and says, "Thomas, here, stick your finger in my side. Look at these nail prints. It's me." And Thomas says, "My Lord, and my God, I believe." 
Annie's parents nod in agreement. 
PREACHER (CONT'D) And Jesus said, "Well, that's good. (MORE) 
PREACHER (CONT'D) But blessed are those who can believe without seeing." It's a lot easier when you can see, and feel, and touch. But like us, we haven't seen him in the flesh. We haven't felt him in the flesh. But we have experienced him in the spirit. At least I have, and I hope y'all have too. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
The family walks through the woods. Annie holds Cooper to her chest in a cloth carrier. Mason has his camera in hand. Dad chews on a piece of straw. 
ANNIE The pond's right up here.   Ooh, it's low. 
DAD Yeah. 
ANNIE You know, my dad could take you fishing next time you're here if you want. 
MASON Nice. 
ANNIE (to Cooper) Hi, baby. What's goin' on? 
Mason and Samantha walk down to the pond.   Annie sits on a picnic bench with Cooper. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) You know, I think we're just gonna hang out here for a minute. 
DAD Want me to stay with you? 
ANNIE No, it's okay. 
DAD You sure? 
ANNIE Yeah, thanks. 
Samantha pushes a stick into the mud.   Mason photographs pond. 
SAMANTHA Mason, why are you such a stick-in- the-mud? 
MASON What are you even talking about? 
DAD Hey, you guys don't mind coming back here on the 20th, do you, for Cooper's baptism? 
MASON No, it's fine. 
DAD Sam? 
SAMANTHA Okay. 
DAD I appreciate it. It means a lot to Annie and her folks, you know. 
MASON Were we baptized? 
They share a look and laugh. 
DAD I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul. We can do it now, though, if you want. 
MASON No, nah, I think I'm alright. 
DAD You and Cooper together, you know. Dunk your heads.

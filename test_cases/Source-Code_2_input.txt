DEREK SHOOTS COLTER TWICE IN THE CHEST. Colter staggers back -- slumps to his knees. Guzman cries out -- makes a run at Derek -- who spins and -- 
BLAM! 
SHOOTS GUZMAN DEAD. Spent shell casings roll to a stop on the tile floor. A terrible silence. 
CHRISTINA (V.O.) What's happening? Are you okay? Are you there? Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood. Then calmly walks out. As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on his beeping WATCH -- Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world 
BLEACHES WHITE... In the haze comes the mystical vision again -- but deeper in: THE STONE WALL now curves over our heads, becoming a TUNNEL. CHRISTINA walks away from us -- down into the tunnel. The far end is ablaze in WHITE LIGHT. We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She continues towards the light... and we do not follow. 
INT. ISOLATION UNIT 
The monitor is dark. Everything is still. Colter in his seat. For long seconds we watch his face. 
INT. ENGINEERING LAB - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY 
A jarring transition. We are now away from Colter's P.O.V. and in the real, physical environment of the Source Code operations center. Military and civilian personnel work amid mysterious scientific equipment. 
Rutledge talks on a wall phone. Like a team player serving his country. 
RUTLEDGE 
(INTO PHONE) Yes... We appreciate that... I just hope the information has come in time to clear the bridges... Thank you, sir. When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other TECHNICIANS. Naked ambition courses through him. 
RUTLEDGE Whether or not they can stop the bridge attack, we came up with the intelligence. And that virtually assures all of our futures. This is just the beginning, guys. 
(TO GOODWIN) You did a great job, Goodwin. You operated our captain with skill and professionalism. What's that you have? Goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a CITATION. 
GOODWIN The Army investigated Colter's helicopter crash in Iraq. Apparently he stayed behind to fly protective cover for a disabled convoy until he ran out of fuel. 
RUTLEDGE What's this, then? Some kind of posthumous reprimand for reckless flying? 
GOODWIN No. It's the Silver Star. Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's breezy good humor. 
RUTLEDGE Send it on to his father. It'll ease the pain of his son's death. 
GOODWIN I thought I might inform the captain of the citation. 
RUTLEDGE Better not. We can't risk acquainting him with the citation in case the memory wipe isn't entirely clean. 
GOODWIN The memory wipe? 
TECHNICIAN I thought we were going to let him die. 
RUTLEDGE I know, I know. But now the Director of National Intelligence is sure to want a closer look at our program, and until we train up another candidate, we'll need to keep Colter around to demonstrate it. 
TECHNICIAN Oh. 
RUTLEDGE This thing is much bigger than any one of us. Goodwin, please clear Colter's memories and re-initialize Source Code. Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of disgust. Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the envelope. 
INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY 
Mission Control. Panels, consoles and screens. Goodwin takes a seat at his workstation. He swings a microphone up and goes to flip a switch. Then stops. Unsure how to proceed. Looks down at the envelope with the citation in it. 
INT. ISOLATION UNIT 
Inside the capsule, the silence continues. Colter thinks to himself. The MONITOR then comes on. 
GOODWIN Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission. 
INT. CORRIDOR - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

PEEP-O-RAMA PORN SHOP - NIGHT \nThe Peep-O-Rama occupies an old Japanese movie house. A geisha-girl sign flashes over the marquee. Beneath that is a blinking neon eye which opens and closes. Other signs offer enticements like \"ONLY 25 CENTS A PEEP!\" and \"REAL GIRLS WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE!\" \nAs Nemo approaches, a laconic HINDU with a throat microphone sits outside, reciting his tired schpiel. \nHINDU \nTokens for the buddy booths, live girls.

BUDDY BOOTH - NIGHT \nNemo enters a cramped booth, clutching a handful of tokens embossed with the Peep-O-Rama eye logo on them. There's a seat, a box of Kleenex, a phone, and a grimy Plexiglas window with a metal shutter over it. \nNemo starts popping tokens into the slot next to the window, pockets the rest of them. \nWith a WHIR the metal shutter rises, revealing a WOMAN in a garter-belt get-up perched on a stool. In a forgiving light, she might even be beautiful. \nAn LED display starts counting down from sixty - the seconds remaining on the metered shutter. Nemo picks up the receiver. \nNEMO \nYou got a name? \nWOMAN \nHolly Daze. Do you want me, baby? \nNEMO \nI need to see some sugar. \nHolly shrugs out of her bra, plants her scuffed-up high heels on either side of the window, runs her hands up and down her body, utters some tired-ass MOANS. \nNEMO \nRight on, sister... \nNemo unbuckles his belt, drops his drawers... \nHOLLY \n(eyeing his endowment) \nMmmm.

STREET - DAY OF THE DEAD CELEBRATION - NIGHT \nA massive street festival is under way with Dia de los Muertos CELEBRANTS mobbing the area. Paper \"BIENVENIDOS\" banners are strung overhead.

People are holding giant papier-mache skulls on sticks along with torches and calavera placards. \nThere are stalls offering marigolds and cockscomb, black beeswax tapers, dangling toy skeletons, mountains of calaveras de azucar. \nASHE \npushes through the throng of revelers, invisible amidst the carnival atmosphere.

JUDAH'S CAMPANILE/CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT \nJudah, now carrying the cage which contains the Crow, sweeps aside the curtain of the camera obscura. He reaches up to a lever which opens the camera's lens. Moonlight shines down on the camera table. With another lever, Judah adjusts the camera's view. \nCAMERA TABLE \nThe camera lens is now trained on the night sky. A churning landscape of night-sky coulds drifts across the table's surface, creating an eerie effect. \nJUDAH \nsets a package wrapped in velvet on the camera table. He peels back the cloth, revealing a set of ornately decorated, tapered daggers. He looks back at Sarah. \nJUDAH \nDo you know what these are called? Misericords. Wonderful name, isn't it? \nJudah removes one of the blades from its sheath, running the glinting edge along his finger. \nJUDAH In the Dark Ages, these were used to deliver the death stroke to the mortally wounded. They were considered tools of mercy. \nJudah turns to the steel cage in which the Crow has been trapped. \nHe pulls on a leather falconer's glove and opens the door to the cage. The Crow flaps his wings madly, desperately trying to strike at Judah with its beak and claws... \n... but Judah secures his grip around the bird's throat, pulling it out. He pins the Crow to the focusing table of the camera obscura with his gloved hand. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY OF THE DEAD CELEBRATION - NIGHT \nAshe fights his way through the crowd.

He pulls himself up, starting the daunting task of scaling the tower. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE/CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT \nBack to Judah and the Crow. The clouds being projected onto the camera table (and subsequently the Crow itself) are rushing at an unearthly speed.

JUDAH'S TOWER - NIGHT \nAshe continues to climb. A cluster of PIGEONS take wing, startled from their roost... \nAshe pulls back, one of his hands slipping free.

JUDAH'S TOWER - CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT \nJudah plunges a second misericord into the Crow's left wing... \nEXT.

He tightens his white-knuckled grip on the ledge above. \nShaking terribly, trying to fight back the pain, Ashe continues to climb. He reaches up to a... \nSTONE MAIDEN \nwhich protrudes from the building's facade. The maiden's face has been all but worn bare by the harsh elements. \nAshe clutches the back of the maiden in a parody of a lover's embrace. Using the statue for support, he drags himself back up to relative safety. Now Ashe is face to face with the maiden, staring into its blind stone eyes. \nASHE \nSarah. \nAshe whispers the word like a mantra, using it to urge him on. Steeling himself again, fighting the burning pain, Ashe resumes his climb. He's on autopilot now, just trying to reach the campanile, which at this point, seems hopelessly unattainable. \nTHE SKY ABOVE \nseems to churn and roil. A storm of epic proportions is about to break. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT \nThe Crow has now been crucified to the camera table, a misericord staked through each wing. \nCROW'S ANAMORPHIC POV \nas Judah reaches for a third misericord.

It's a drunken DWARF with fucked-up teeth who's laughing his ass of at Ashe. Ashe recoils, horrified, then spins around, suddenly finding himself face to face with... \nJUDAH \nstanding just a few yards away, emerging from the doorway of his tower. He got the anti-Crow blood mask on his face. His eyes are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a feral snarl. In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his campanile. \nJudah grabs Ashe by the lapels of his coat, draging him close so they're eye to eye -- close enough to breathe the same beath -- two sides of a coin. \nJUDAH \nTell me, Ashe. Do you every get the feeling we're all just dead men on leave? \nASHE \n(seething with hatred) \nJudah. \nJUDAH \nIn the flesh. \nJudah flings Ashe backwards... \nAshe reaches his hand into his coat, pulling out a .45. He FIRES into Judah's chest - once, twice, thrice... \nJudah doesn't even stagger, he just keeps on grinning. Wisps of smoke rise up from the holes in his chest. \nAshe stares at Judah, dumbfounded. \nASHE \nWhat...are...you? \nJUDAH \nI'm your shadow, Ashe. Every angel's got a devil. Didn't you know that? Or maybe you just slept your way through Sunday school? \nJudah lashes out with the rope. Ashe spins and falters. Incredibly, he finds himself feeling pain. \nJudah follows with a series of blows, each more savage than the next, driving Ashe back... \nAshe stumbles, falls to his hands and knees. He reaches to his mouth, his hand comes away spattered with blood. Ashe shakes his head to clear it. \nJudah kicks Ashe in the face, knocking him onto his back... \n...but Ashe springs back to his feet. He tries to strike Judah. Judah catches Ashe's hand and squeezes tight. We hear bones snapping. \nCRACK! Judah smashes out with his other fist, Ashe spins around and collapses... \nAshe tries to push himself up by his hands. He coughs, spitting up more blood, crawls forward... \nASHE \nWhat... did you do to me...? \nJUDAH \nI've tasted the blood of the Crow and taken your power. \nWHOOSH! Judah whips the rope about, snapping the end around Ashe's neck, dragging him off his feet. \nJudah pulls Ashe forward, crouching over him like a spider ready to devour its prey. \nJUDAH \nYou're flesh and blood now, Ashe. You can die like any other man. \nASHE \nGo to hell. \nJUDAH \nAlready been there. And I must confess, I liked what I saw. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

More than ever. \nSibyl raises her other hand. She's holding one of the misericords which she extends to Sarah. \nSIBYL \nGo to him. \nSarah takes the misericord and racees for the end of the campanile, towards a beckoning doorway and a stairwell beyond. Printed on a grime-smeared placard nearby are the words... \n\"THIS IS NOT AN EXIT\" \nSarah rushes through the doorway, heedless. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nJudah plants his foot on Ashe's chest, tightening the chain around Ashe's throat. \nJUDAH \nLooks like the dead have forsaken you, my friend. \nAshe clutches at the rusty chain links which bite into his flesh, choking. \nJUDAH \nLook at you, bleeding like a stuck pig. Where's your precious strength? Where's your power? \n(drawing closer, whispering) \nYou're nothing now, Ashe, not even a ghost. \nJudah rises.

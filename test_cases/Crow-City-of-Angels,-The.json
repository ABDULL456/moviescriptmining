{"train": "THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS \nWritten by \nDavid S Goyer & James O'Barr \nFADE IN: \nEXT. LIMBO - DAY/NIGHT \nA heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying toward the camera in slow motion. \nSARAH (O.S.) \nI believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven... \nPresently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK. A warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony mask war paint. \nSARAH (O.S.) \nAnd so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the hopes that somehow, some day... \nThe figure on horseback sweeps past us, disappearing once again into the mists of time. \nSARAH (V.O.) \n... they will be reunited with the ones they love. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DOCS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT \nPresent day. The Crow settles on a shipping container, tilts its head, watching... \nSUPER TITLE: \n\"CITY OF ANGELS - OCTOBER 29TH - LA NOCHE DE SAN LUCAS\" \nCLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS tearing open a tiny glassine envelope filled with powder - our drug du jour - Trinity. The face of the envelope has been stamped with an image - a cartoon imp with a shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up sign. \nA MAN lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder. The man discards the glassine envelope... \nFOLLOWING THE ENVELOPE \nas it flutters to the ground, landing \"imp-side\" up. Let the rush begin. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nGarbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog. Although once part of a thriving shipping industry, decades of decline have seen these docks become a hellish dumping ground. Case in point: \nA FATHER AND HIS YOUNG SON \nare kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their arms linked together, then tied behind their backs. DANNY CORVEN (8) is quietly sobbing. ASHE (late 20s), tries to calm the frightened boy. \nDANNY \nI'm sorry, Dad...I'm sorry... I didn't mean to look... \nASHE \nIt's okay, Danny. It's okay... \nNEMO (O.S.) \nLights... \nA bright light comes on. Ashe and Danny turn their heads to avoid the glare. \nNEMO (O.S.) \n...camera... \nCLOSE ON \nA camcorder lens as it auto-focuses, bringing Danny's distorted face into view via the lens' reflection. \nNEMO (O.S.) \n...action. \nCAMERA FINDS Ashe and Danny's executioners, CURVE, KALI, SPIDER MONKEY, and NEMO. \nNEMO, a post-modern sleaze-hound, circles Danny and Ashe with a camcorder. He Pats Ashe's face. \nNEMO \nMake-up. \nSPIDER MONKEY, lean and gangly, crouches next to Ashe, holding a marigold in his hand. \nSPIDER MONKEY \nrides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods, and earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present ghosts. We pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - \"GO BACK\". Nevertheless, we continue on. \nSARAH (V.O.) \nThey say that time cancels pain. I don't know about that. Eight years ago I lost two of my best friends. Two thousand miles later I find I'm still living in the past... \nTHE CROW \nsweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete and grimy glass. Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's silent HOMELESS. Automobile hulks littering the streets like insect husks. The shifting searchlights of police helicopters... \nWE PASS OVER SARAH'S ROOFTOP \nThe Crow circles downward... \nSARAH (V.O.) \nEvery night when I close my eyes the dreams come. That's how the dead talk to us, I guess. In the dark, when our souls are off wandering... \nINT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT \nThe Crow lands next to an open window. It perches on the edge, looking into the loft. \nSARAH (V.O.) \nI just wish I understood what they were telling me. \nCROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC) \nSARAH, early 20s, lies asleep in bed. She stirs, troubled by uneasy dreams, rolls over, opens her eyes... \nINT. SARAH'S LOFT, SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT \nAs Sarah rises the Crow flits away like yesterday's memory. Sarah's not sure whether or not she dreamed the bird. GABRIEL, the cat Sarah inherited from Eric and Shelly, is perched on the end of the bed. \nSARAH \nHey, Gabriel... \nSarah gives the cat an obligatory behind-the-ear scratch, then climbs from bed, making her way across the loft. \nSARAH'S ARTIST LOFT \nis furnished in thrift-store treasures. The loft has an earthy warmth to it, in stark contrast to the urban decay outside - an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an arching half-circle window through which Sarah can view the local wildlife on the streets below. \nON SARAH'S CANVASSES \nTurbulent oils reminiscent of history's brooding symbolist painters. Give Sarah's childhood inspiration, the subject matter is no real surprise. \nCAMERA ISOLATES a work-in-progress. The painting depicts a woman resembling Sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale-faced lover, surrounded by a sea of watchful dead. \nSARAH \nreaches the shower, strips off her clothes. Her back and upper arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades. She's got a ring in her navel, another in a nipple... \nIn short, the skate-waif we knew back in Detroit has matured quite a bit since that fateful Devil's Night. Sarah shuts here eyes, turns her face up into the spray. For a brief second we see a flash of... \nEXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT \nAshe's death. Plunging into the icy waters, down into darkness. Just as suddenly we are back in... \nINT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT \nSarah's eyes snap open. She holds a hand out to the shower wall, takes a moment to collect herself. \nTroubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes. Among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh, the symbol of eternity. \nAs Sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the irony mask that used to hang by Shelly's mirror. Next to the mask is a... \nTARNISHED WEDDING RING \nOnce Shelly's. There's an inscription inside - \"FOREVER\". \nSarah fingers the ring a moment, glancing at the irony mask. Lots of memories. Lots of ghosts. \nGabriel creeps up, MEOWING forlornly. \nSARAH \n(WISTFULLY) \nMe too. \nShe threads the ring onto her necklace, letting it fall next to the ankh, then slips the silver chain over her head. Sarah stands, pulls on a jacket, heads out. \nEXT. SARAH'S LOFT, STREET - DUSK \nAn ill-wind kicks up trash and grit. Sarah glances down. Dozens of the glassine imp envelopes swirl around Sarah's feet like confetti. One of the envelopes has stuck to her heel. As she peels it off, she catches sight of... \nA PALE FACE \nin a shadowed entryway. It's a TEENAGED GIRL (16), strung out on drugs. The girl cowers in a narrow stairway, hugging herself, shivering from withdrawal. \nSARAH \nBeats pushing ink in Detroit. \nNOAH \nThat it does, Princess, that it does. \n(REMEMBERING) \nOh, I bought you a little present... \nNoah reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls something out. It's a handmade candy sugar skull with a little strip of paper glued to the bottom - a fortune. \nNOAH \nThey do 'em for the Day of the Dead. \n(tossing the skull to Sarah) \nNice, huh? Necrophagia, Princess. Eat the dead. \nSARAH \n(reading fortune) \n\"Life is just a dream on the way to death.\" I like that. \nSarah studies the skull, then pops it in her mouth, nodding. Noah rises, stretching. \nNOAH \nWant to grab a beer, then? \nSARAH \nNo, I gotta go home. Haven't been sleeping much lately. \nNOAH \nSo, what's the dirty dog's name? \nSARAH \nI've just been having some weird dreams. \n(REFLECTING) \nYou ever dream that you're dying someone else's death? \nOutside we hear a MOTORCYCLE pulling up, then someone KNOCKS on the front door. \nNOAH \n(calling out) \nSorry, we're closed. \nCURVE \nappears outside. He POUNDS harder on the door. \nCURVE \nOpen the fucking door! \nNOAH \nstands, moves to the door. \nNOAH \nLook, I said we're... \nBANG! Curve kicks open the door and storms in. He PUNCHES Noah in the nose, then heads straight for Sarah. \nCURVE \nYou think what you did to me is funny? Some kind of joke? \nSARAH \nWhat are you talking about?! \nCURVE \nI'm talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me! I took off the bandages. Look...!!! \nCurve rips open his shirt, revealing his chest. \nCURVE'S TATTOO \nEXT. GRAY GARGOYLE, ALLEYWAY - NIGHT \nSarah rushes out of her car, screaming at the bird. \nSARAH \nGet out of here! Go!!! \nSarah FIRES a wild shot into the sky. The Crow files off into the night. Sarah collapses against the hood of her Galaxy and starts to cry. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT \nThe Crow soars away from the Gargoyle, toward the beckoning lights of Downtown. In the distance, a flashing \"JESUS SAVES\" sign draws our attention to a monolithic tower. \nEXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT \nThe Crow makes its way towards the decaying tower, which is crowned by a weather-worn campanile. The campanile is a complex arabesque of rusted iron scrollwork, like something Antonio Gaudi conjured up from an art nouveau fever-dream. \nJust as the Crow is about to reach the campanile, it banks away. We, however, continue to rush onward, right through one of the dark openings in the scrollwork... \nINT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT \nSCRITCH! SCRITCH! All we see is black, then some vague, shiny reflections... \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a stag beetle, imprisoned within a box, leashed to a nail with a piece of thread. We were tight on its shiny carapace. The beetle strains at its leash, moving in a perpetual circle around the nail. \nCAMERA MOVES UP \nover the side of the box. Although mere inches in height, this enclosure might as well be the Great Wall as far as our little member of the Coleoptera is concerned. \nAS THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK \nwe see crime lord Judah Earl's lair in all its sepulchral glory... \nDark, filled with shadows. The decor is a cross between ruinous palatial splendor and a SoHo industrial art installation. The upper reaches of the campanile are laced with a spiderweb network of steel girders. \nLook close enough and you might see PEOPLE bound to the supporting pillars, like the half-glimpsed shapes crouching at the foot of your bed in the middle of the night. \nVOICES draw our attention to an area partitioned off by chain-mail curtains. CAMERA MOVES IN towards a break in the curtains. We linger there for a tantalizing moment... \nJUDAH (V.O.) \nTalk to me, Sibyl. Tell me what you see. \nSIBYL (V.O.) \nI see Death returning from the veil of tears. He has your name on his tongue. \nNow we plunge in through the curtains... \nThe \"camera\" consists of a series of lenses and mirrors which project images from the outside world onto a circular table, offering the ultimate voyeuristic view of the crumbling cityscape. TWO FIGURES stand with their backs to us, studying the camera's view. The first is... \nJUDAH EARL, \nA sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure with a guttural voice. Old before his time, touched by childhood visions of his own death. The tower is Judah's prison in more ways than one. \nSIBYL, Judah's blind oracle, waits by his side. Attractive, though of indeterminate sex. His/her dour features are hidden beneath a black cowl. \nJUDAH \n(FATALISTIC) \nIt's finally beginning, isn't it? What mask will Death wear, can you tell me that? \nSIBYL \nI see the face of one of your victims. \nJudah lifts his head up and we see his luminous amber eyes for the first time. A kind of madness dances within them. \nJUDAH \nAll my sins remembered. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT \nSarah sits in bed, cigarette burning in one hand, a half-filled wine glass in the other. She turns out her light, looks to the window and the cityscape beyond - as if the answers were lying out there in the steam-cloaked streets. \nCUT TO: \nSOMEONE'S SPEED-INDUCED POV. Performers flaunt their flesh on a raised stage. CROWDS OF SEXUAL LIBERTINES and CUTTING EDGE FETISHISTS writhe as one on the dance floor. Lots of rubber, latex strap bodices, Victorian hoop skirts - it's a modern-day De Sade's wet-dream. \nREVERSE ANGLE \non Curve as he pushes his way upstairs and through the tangle of flesh. \nHe pulls up to a bar, takes a seat alongside Kali and Spider Monkey (who's amusing himself with a Viewmaster). CLICK, CLICK - we see \nASHE \n(READING) \n\"...midway through our life's journey I came to myself within a dark wood where the straight way was lost...\" \nDanny asleep, curled up next to his father. Ashe reaches out and strokes Danny's hair... \nCLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE \nHis dead eyes suddenly open. Confusion. Pain. Fear. A stream of bubbles rushes from his mouth, obscuring our view. \nASHE'S POV \nAs the bubbles clear, Danny's face comes into focus just a few inches from his own. \nAshe panics, jerks back. The razor-wire barbs cut into his flesh. The more he struggles, the tighter the coils become, slashing his hands and face, shredding his clothes. He's caught in his son's embrace, the two of them thrashing about in a grotesque underwater ballet. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIVER STYX BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe headlights of Sarah's Galaxy cut through the fog. She pulls up just in time to see the Crow disappearing into the mist which cloaks the bridge. Sarah follows, trying to keep up with the bird. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT \nAshe's struggles become more and more violent. He thrashes, churning up a cloud of bubbles. We are intercutting quickly now, between Ashe's turmoil and... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT \nSarah reaches the pier where Ashe and Danny were executed. She climbs from her car... \nTHE CROW \nflies on ahead, landing atop one of the piles, staring down into the water. \nAND AS SARAH \nstarts toward the bird we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT \nAshe tears his hands free, clawing his body away from the barbwire, swimming to the surface in a storm of bubbles... \nFLASHBACKS \nof subjective POVs. The killers walking down the jetty, marching Ashe and Danny to their deaths and... \nEXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT \nWe are beneath the jetty now in the present, looking up through the slats as a FIGURE (Sarah?) makes its way to the water... \nCamera CRANES UP from beneath the jetty to reveal Sarah standing there in silhouette... \nEXT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT \nAshe is propelled towards the surface. \nEXT. DOCKS COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT \nAshe suddenly bursts from the sea with his arms outstretched. A hellish Venus on the half-shell. Gasping, full of terror and rage. He lets loose a TORTURED HOWL. \nASHE \ndigs his fingers into the wood-rot pulp of the pilings and claws his way up to the jetty. He collapses down onto the wooded slats. \nASHE \ncrouches before us, his face hidden from view. He reaches out his hand, touching an unmistakable BLOOD STAIN... Danny's blood stain. This triggers more painful memories... \nEXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT \nImages from Ashe and Danny's execution assault him. BANG!!! Kali FIRING her gun. Ashe SCREAMING. Danny's body slumping forward like a marionette whose strings have been severed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT (PRESENT) \nAshe lifts his head, WAILING. He's covered from head to toe in ocean-bottom silt. Blood from the razor-wire wounds has smeared across his face in patterns which eerily recall the Crow make-up. Strips of the wire still cling to his arms and chest, the barbs buried deep in his flesh. \nReliving the violent moment is more than his mind can bear. Ashe's eyes roll up into his head. The world spins around him. But even as the lights are going out, Ashe glimpses... \nA DARK FIGURE \nstanding in front of him. It's the last thing Ashe sees before consciousness escapes him. \nAshe rockets beneath the gothic arches of the freeway overpass on his motorcycle, hellfire burning in his eyes, his coat flapping behind him like a fallen angel's wings. \nTHE CROW \nflies alongside Ashe. \nTHE CROW \nlands on a telephone wire, studying the warehouse. \nPresently we hear Ashe's MOTORCYCLE approaching, then we see the front wheel of his bike pulling into the foreground. \nCROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC) \nAshe turns to the Crow, slyly giving the bird the thumbs-up sign... \nMATCH CUT TO... \nINT. SPIDER MONKEY'S WAREHOUSE LAB - NIGHT \nCA-CHUNK, CA-CHUNK, CA-CHUNK. CLOSE ON a sheet of glassine drug bags as a hand-powered printing press comes down, mass-producing the image of the imp giving us the thumbs up... \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL the lab set up in a maze of barrells. The walls are stained from the toxic fumes. Blacked-out windows sweat with moisture. There are heating mantles rigged with flasks and condensers, vacuum pumps - along with ingredients like battery acid, paint thinner, and Epsom salts. Nearby are dozens of 50-gallon drums containing the finished product. \nSpider Monkey is working away at the printing press, pausing to snoot some of Judah's drug. Nearby is an old TV featuring lurid videos of amateur bull riding - we watch as a drunken participant gets gored. \nSuddenly the power in the lab goes out, the TV screen sputters and goes dark. \nSPIDER MONKEY \nOno! \nASHE (O.S.) \n'My mother was accursed the night she bore me and I am faint with envy of all the dead'. \nSpider Monkey whirls around, startled. Ashe is sitting cross-legged on one of the tables, grinning like a black leather Buddha. \nASHE \nTell me, Monkey. Does the corpse have a familiar face? \nSPIDER MONKEY \nWho the fuck are you? \nASHE \nYou have to learn to look beyond the mask. \nAshe jumps down from the table, walking into the light. Spider Monkey's eyes widen in recognition. \nSPIDER MONKEY \nNo way, man...we put you under...you and that little snot-nosed kid... \nAshe dips his hand into one of the 50-gallon drums. He blows a handful of the Trinity dust at Spider Monkey. Spider Monkey, terminally spooked, reaches back to the counter behind him, searching for something... \nASHE \nLooking for this? \nAshe holds up a pistol and puts it to his head. \nASHE \n(an evil grin) \nDon't try this at home, kids. \nBOOM! ASHE \nputs a bullet through his own forehead. His head snaps backward and his body collapses onto the floor. Spider Monkey creeps forward toward Ashe's body... \nASHE \nsprings from the ground, SLAMMING Spider Monkey against a table of chemicals. Bottles SHATTER on the floor, spilling their toxic contents. \nSPIDER MONKEY \nWhat are you?! What the fuck are you?! \nAshe leans in so he's eye to eye with Spider Monkey. \nASHE \nI wasn't sure at first. Now I know. I'm the boiling man, Monkey. I'm the plague of Darkness and the death of the first-born. All your nightmares rolled into one. \nAshe removes a wooden match from his inside coat pocket. He scrapes his thumb-nail over the head, igniting it. \nSPIDER MONKEY \nNEMO \nShitfire... \nNemo fumbles with his pants, scoops out some more tokens... \nToo late, the shutter is already closing. Nemo feeds some more tokens into the slot. Nothing happens. Nemo punches the LED display. \nNEMO \nCome on, fucker! \nThe shutter starts rattling up again, only this time... \nASHE \nis standing on the other side of the Plexiglas. His mouth splits into an evil grin. \nASHE \n\"Do you want me, baby?\" \nNemo's eyes just about pop from his skull. \nNEMO \nYou. \nASHE \nMe. \nCRASH! Ashe slams his fists through the Plexiglas window, reaching for Nemo's throat. \nINT. PEEP-O-RAMA, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nNemo comes flying out the booth door. He struggles to rise. A CHORUS OF ORGASMIC SIGHS and cheesy SURF MUSIC drifts out from the other booths. \nZEKE \n(o.s.) \nHey, mime boy. \nAT THE FRONT COUNTER. \nZEKE, the Peep-O-Rama's corpulent manager, is cradling a sawed-off shotgun. BOOM! He blows a blast into Ashe's chest! \nAshe starts toward Zeke, unfazed. Zeke moves to fire again... \nAshe snatches the shotgun from the fat man's grasp, smashing him in the face with the butt-end. Zeke falls back into a video display, sending an avalanche of porno tapes raining down on top of him. \nSeizing the moment, Nemo rushes for the exit... \nAshe spins, pumps the shotgun, blows out one of Nemo's kneecaps. Nemo collapses on the floor, wailing like a child. Ashe strides over to him. \nASHE \nOne crow sorrow... \nHe HEAVES Nemo through a glass display booth filled with sex toys. Ashe punctuates each line of the nursery rhyme with a new assault on Nemo. \nASHE \n...two crows joy... \nNemo starts dragging his broken body across the floor. He finds himself face to face with an anatomically-correct blow-up sex doll - the kind with a built-in pre-recorded memory chip. \nDOLL \nOoh, oh baby, I like it like that. You're so good. You're so good... \nASHE \nThree crows a letter, four crows a boy... \nAshe HEAVES Nemo back the other way, sending him SMASHING into the front counter. Peep-O-Rama tokens go flying, bouncing and spinning every which way... \nCLOSE ON A SPINNING TOKEN \nOn one side of the coin the eye is open, on the other it's closed - this creates the illusion of the eye blinking. \nASHE \nFive crows silver, six crows gold... \nNemo utters a half-sob and rolls over, feebly wiping away the blood which is clouding his eyes. \nASHE \nSeven crows a secret never to be told. \nDo you know what they call a gathering of crows, Curve? \nAt the sound of Ashe's voice, Curve's eyes widen with fear. \nASHE'S VOICE \nA murder. A murder of crows. Think about it. \nCLICK! The line goes dead. Furious, Curve tears the phone from the wall, HEAVING it across the porno shop. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET/CHURCH - NIGHT \nAshe exits a phone booth, leaving the receiver dangling. A DOG BARKS nearby, followed by the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING. Ashe turns and sees... \nA GROUP OF CHILDREN running away, giggling, their FOOTSTEPS receding into the night. \nA BLACK DOG trots toward Ashe. The children have tied a plastic skull mask to the dog's head. The skull dog trots up the street towards... \nA SMALL, INNER-CITY LATINO CHURCH \nsandwiched between two derelict buildings. The doors are open - there's a path of marigold petals leading up the front steps. The skull dog trots up the steps and enters. \nINT. CHURCH - NIGHT \nAshe moves into the sanctuary. He watches from the rear, entranced. PEOPLE are scattered amongst the pews. \nAt the altar is a lavish offrenda - an offering of food and drink for the wandering dead decorated with sugar skulls and floral garlands. Amidst the decorations are photos of departed loved ones. There are tiers of candles surrounding these, scores of them. \nAn ELDERLY PRIEST emerges from a confessional, looking to Ashe with a raised eyebrow...\"Next?\". \nPRIEST \nCan I help you? \nASHE \nI'm sorry, Father, I was just watching... \nPRIEST \nOur doors are open. \nThe Priest moves to a candelabra and lights some tapers. \nASHE \nWhat is this for? \nPRIEST \nDias de los Muertos, the Days of the Dead. We light the candles for our loved ones - so that they might find their way back to earth and share in the pleasures of the living. \nAshe watches an OLD WOMAN place a toy motorcycle in front of a picture of a child. \nPRIEST \nTomorrow night we will celebrate. The people will dance, sing... \n(indicating Ashe's makeup) \n...many will wear masks. \nASHE \nWhy? \nPRIEST \nSome spirits linger here too long. They become confused, mistaking themselves for the living. They have to be frightened away. \nThe priest nods to Ashe and moves down the aisle to the next candelabra. \nA LITTLE BOY \nis watching Ashe from one of the back pews. He clutches a striped ball. He drops it. \nThe boy rolls the ball across the floor to Ashe. Ashe kneels and catches it, rolling it back. The boy smiles. \nBOY \nSanta Muerte. \nUnnerved, Ashe retreats out of the sanctuarly, letting the night's shadows swallow him up once more. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT \nSarah sits by her paintings. Gabriel suddenly stands, arching his back, hair standing on end. \nYou go back. \nASHE \nWhat if I don't want to go back? \nSarah looks away. \nSARAH \nThen you're damned \nINT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON A VIDEO MONITOR. We're watching the tape documenting Ashe's death. We see Ashe's face sinking beneath the water's surface. The image freezes. \nCURVE (O.S.) \nIt was him. It was that son of a bitch we dumped off the pier. I know it. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL Judah, Curve, and Kali gathered around the monitor. Sibyl waits nearby. Curve is snapping open an envelope of Trinity, sniffing up the contents. \nJUDAH \nI thought you killed him. \nCURVE \nI shot him in the head! \nKALI \nHe's a ghost. \nCURVE \nNo such thing as ghosts. \nKALI \n(POINTEDLY) \nThen who killed Spider Monkey and Nemo? \nCurve starts pacing, growing more apprehensive. \nCURVE \nAll I know is, he's fucking with us. The Crow's his symbol, right? That means I'm marked. It means he's coming for me now! \nKALI \nI thought you said you didn't believe? \nCurve turns on Kali, furious, ready to strike her. In a flash, Kali has one of her katanas out. \nCurve backs away, bristling. \nCURVE \nLook, you want to tell yourselves some bullshit fairytales, that's your business. But i'm not gonna sit here with a fucking target on my chest. I'm going to take this motherfucker out! \nSIBYL \nYou won't stop him with bullets or knives. He doesn't feel pain. He doesn't bleed. Don't you see? His soul has crossed over. He's come back from the other side. \nCurve looks like he's going to be sick from fear. But Kali and Judah are listening intently.l \nJUDAH \nSo how do you stop a man who's already dead? \nSIBYL \nCan you look destiny in the eye without flinching? \nJudah studies Sibyl's shadowed face. \nJUDAH \nYou tell me. \nA stare-down ensues. Judah doesn't avert his gaze. \nSIBYL \nThe Crow is the source of his power - his link between this world and the next. Sever that link and he's as vulnerable as the next man. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT \nCurve zooms by a bridal shop-sees his own reflection in the window. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nCurve SHRIEKS, turns into the Alley, tachometer red-lining. He glances behind him...The crow flies by. \nTHE CROW \nplunges down from the night sky, wings flapping madly, quickly gaining on Curve like the breath of death. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nAshe, in a dream-like state, races along. \nEXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT \nCurve leans in low, trying to urge his bike on by will-power alone. He races by a warehouse, veering off the road onto the railroad tracks. \nUP ABOVE, \nAshe appears on the overpass, riding on his own motorcycle, matching Curve's speed. \nTHE CROW \nsoars higher for a bird's eye view, tracking Curve's progress as it sweeps past chimneys, swerves around billboards, ducks under laundry lines... \nON ASHE \nas he ROCKETS along the overpass. The Crow lands on his shoulder. Ahead is a break in the guard rail. Ashe cuts sharply to the right, taking the motorcycle airborne through the break in the rail and... \nASHE \n...lands on the surface street some thirty feet below! Ashe is now just behind Curve. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT \nSarah is back at work on the painting of the woman being cradled by her lover. Gabriel, who's lounging nearby, suddenly looks up and HISSES. \nUP ABOVE THEM \nthe Crow lands on the skylight, staring down at Sarah, watching... \nThere's a KNOCK at her door. Sarah approaches, looks through the peephole... \nSARAH \nWho is it? \nSARAH'S POV (THROUGH FISH-EYE PEEPHOLE) \nKali stands there, cradling an automatic. She's flanked by TWO IDENTICAL TWIN THUGS. Kali FIRES into the lock... \nEXT. TUNNEL MOUTH - NIGHT \nThe chase continues. Curve approaches the bridge doing well past ninety. Abruptly, he cuts down a roadway which parallels the river. There's a chain-link running across the mouth of the tunnel. \nUp ahead is a hole in the fence leading down to a tunnel spillway. Curve guides his bike through the hole... \nINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT \nCurve speeds into the dark tunnel, splashing through puddles of water, whipping past graffiti. As he nears the mouth at the other end, Curve brakes hard, TIRES SQUEALING, almost going down... \nCURVE'S POV \nWe are now beneath the bridge. It's a stone-cold dead-end. The roadway slopes sharply downward, spilling out into the concrete river bed which is filled to capacity with rushing flood waters. \nBACK TO SCENE \nWe hear the ROAR of an approaching motorcycle, then an engine cutting out. Curve looks back the way he came... \nAT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TUNNEL \nAshe's siilhouette steps into view. He's on foot now, clutching the sawed-off shotgun. He lets loose a LAUGH which chills Curve to the bone. \nASHE \n\"I have a rendezvous with Death, on some scarred slope of battered hill...\" \nAshe starts into the tunnel. His WET FOOTSTEPS echo off the weeping walls... \nASHE \n\"God knows, 'twere better to be deep where love throbs out in blissful sleep, pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath...\" \nAs Ashe draws closer, his death-like face emerges from the gloom - a ghastly visage floating in the ether... \nASHE \n\"But I have a rendezvous with Death. And I to my pledged word am true...\" \nthe petals have clustered around Curve's body in the shape of a Crow. Curve continues to float downstream towards an estuary, borne away on the wings of the bird. \nEND OF MOVED SCENE \nINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT \nAshe starts back into the tunnel. He pauses a moment, kneeling down, lowering his head. Whether out of respect for the dead or his own condition, we'll never know. \nAfter a minute, Ashe lifts his head again and stands. It's time to see his mission through to the end. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT \nAshe is heading back from the river when he's struck by... \nA VISION OF THE CROW'S POV OF SARAH \nASHE \nis seeing what the crow is witnessing - Sarah in danger. \nASHE \nSarah! \nAshe starts to run, back toward his bike... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nAshe is on the motorcycle, racing through the streets. He takes a corner on a skid, zipping past the Gray Gargoyle and the neighboring train tracks. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT \nAshe pulls up on the motorcycle, SCREECHING to a stop. He leaps from the bike, rushing into Sarah's building. \nINT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT \nAshe stumbles through the doorway into the loft... \nThe loft has been trashed. Furniture turned over, paintings slashed, the ceramic irony mask smashed into pieces... \nASHE \n(alarmed, desperately looking for her) \nSarah?! \nKALI (O.S.) \nSarah's gone, ghost man. \nAshe whirls around \nKALI \nwho had been standing still amidst the shadows, now moves from behind Sarah's paintings. \nASHE \nWhere is she? \nKALI \nJudah's tower. He's waiting for you there. \nAs Kali steps closer we see that she's dressed for war -- a katana secured in a black scabbard, twin daggers on each hip, a bandoleer of throwing stars. \nASHE \nYou took my son's life. \nKALI \n(GASPING) \nSome people are born victims. \nASHE \nIt takes two to make a murder. \nKali unsheathes her katana. The blade edge catches the streetlight's glare coming in from the window. \nKALI \nShall we dance? \n(SHRUGGING) \nI saw a need, I exploited it. It's all economics, Sarah. Supply and demand. \nSARAH \nWhy did you bring me here? \nJUDAH \nI'm glad you asked that, Sarah. You've got a very important part to play in this little drama of ours. You see, I intend to capture the Crow... \nJudah draws near, devouring Sarah with his hungry eyes. USING A JAGGED FINGERNAIL, HE INCISES A CROSS INTO HER FOREHEAD. \nJUDAH (O.S.) \n... and you, my dear, are the birdseed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SARAH'S LOFT/ALLEY - NIGHT \nKali comes CRASHING through the window, falling down to the sidewalk below. She lands atop a wrecked car, snapping her back in two... \nCLOSE ON KALI \nlies on the ground, her limbs twisted at awkward angles. She MOANS, somehow still alive. \nKALI'S POV \nas Ashe approaches. The Crow flits in from off-screen, landing on his shoulder. Watching Kali with it's curious golden eyes. \nAs Ashe draws near, Kali tries to rise. The most she can do is lift her head. \nKALI \n(GASPING) \nI...can't...move... \nAshe stares at her, dispassionate. \nKALI \nKill...me, then...finish...it... \nAshe simply shakes his head. \nKALI \nYou...have to. \nASHE \nMy job is to send you to hell. You're in it. \nKali stares at Ashe in disbelief, her stoic warrior's mien quickly evaporating. \nKALI \nThere's no...honor in this. It's my...death. I've won it.. \nAshe turns and starts away. \nASHE \nMe, too. \nKALI \nWait! Where are you going?! Wait! You can't...do this! You can't do this!!! \nBut Ashe doesn't turn back. He leaves Kali in the cold, wet street, ignoring her pathetic laments. \nAshe continues on to the end of the alley... \nTHE CROW \nlands on Ashe's outstretched hand. \nThe Crow takes wing, lifting its way up into the night. \nAshe fires up the motorcycle's engine, tearing away from Sarah's apartment in a cloud of smoke. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT \nThe scene resumes. Sarah stares at Judah, horrified. \nSARAH \nSARAH \n(shaking her chain) \nGO!!! \nWHOOSH! A steel cage on a wire and pulley system CLATTERS down from above, SLAMMING to the floor and trapping the bird within it. The bird CAWS angrily, flitting from one side of the cage to another, but its efforts are futile. \nCROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC) \nas Judah emerges from the darkness, crouching down on the floor to study the Crow. He grins. \nJUDAH \nLook who's come home to roost. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY OF THE DEAD CELEBRATION - NIGHT \nA massive street festival is under way with Dia de los Muertos CELEBRANTS mobbing the area. Paper \"BIENVENIDOS\" banners are strung overhead. CHILDREN light strings of firecrackers. Masked MUMMERS in garish costumes dance, MUSICIANS stroll. People are holding giant papier-mache skulls on sticks along with torches and calavera placards. \nThere are stalls offering marigolds and cockscomb, black beeswax tapers, dangling toy skeletons, mountains of calaveras de azucar. \nASHE \npushes through the throng of revelers, invisible amidst the carnival atmosphere. In his makeup he's just another face in the crowd. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE/CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT \nJudah, now carrying the cage which contains the Crow, sweeps aside the curtain of the camera obscura. He reaches up to a lever which opens the camera's lens. Moonlight shines down on the camera table. With another lever, Judah adjusts the camera's view. \nCAMERA TABLE \nThe camera lens is now trained on the night sky. A churning landscape of night-sky coulds drifts across the table's surface, creating an eerie effect. \nJUDAH \nsets a package wrapped in velvet on the camera table. He peels back the cloth, revealing a set of ornately decorated, tapered daggers. He looks back at Sarah. \nJUDAH \nDo you know what these are called? Misericords. Wonderful name, isn't it? \nJudah removes one of the blades from its sheath, running the glinting edge along his finger. \nJUDAH In the Dark Ages, these were used to deliver the death stroke to the mortally wounded. They were considered tools of mercy. \nJudah turns to the steel cage in which the Crow has been trapped. \nHe pulls on a leather falconer's glove and opens the door to the cage. The Crow flaps his wings madly, desperately trying to strike at Judah with its beak and claws... \n... but Judah secures his grip around the bird's throat, pulling it out. He pins the Crow to the focusing table of the camera obscura with his gloved hand. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY OF THE DEAD CELEBRATION - NIGHT \nAshe fights his way through the crowd. A drunken, MASKED WOMAN grabs hold of him, spins him around, dancing. Ashe shoves her aside, making his way to... \nEXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, STREET LEVEL - NIGHT \nThe black sky beyond shimmers with turbulent yellow thunderheads. The entry way to the tower has been gated and chained. The only way in is up. \nEXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, STREET LEVEL - NIGHT \nAshe grabs a hold of one of the ornamental statues which crowd th ebuildint's facade. He pulls himself up, starting the daunting task of scaling the tower. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE/CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT \nBack to Judah and the Crow. The clouds being projected onto the camera table (and subsequently the Crow itself) are rushing at an unearthly speed. The create a surreal backdrop for the Crow's frenetically beating wings - in effect, a mockery of the bird flying. \nJUDAH \nEasy, little wing. It will all be over soon. \nEXT. JUDAH'S TOWER - NIGHT \nAshe continues to climb. A cluster of PIGEONS take wing, startled from their roost... \nAshe pulls back, one of his hands slipping free. He dangles there for a moment, hanging by the tenuous grasp of his fingertips. \nSIBYL \nwho has been lurking in the shadows, suddenly lifts her head up... \nSIBYL \nEXT. JUDAH'S TOWER - NIGHT \nAshe Cries out a final time as a GAPING WOUND appears on his chest, BLOOD BLOSSOMING outward. \nCITY STREET \nThe Day of the Dead celebrants swirl around us, Judah's Tower rising up behind the mob - an unholy ziggurat built to challenge the gods. The CROWD has been worked up into a frenzy. Everyone is singing and dancing. MUSIC blasts from loudspeakers... \nASHE \ncomes CRASHING DOWN atop a small vending stall filled to the brim with flowers an sugar skulls. Time slows as a flurry of golder marigold petals flutter down around his still form. \nINT. JUDAH'S CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT \nThe Crow is dead, transfixed by the gleaming misericords. Blood is pooling beneath black flight feathers. \nJudah steps back, momentarily overwhelmed by the enormity of his crime. \nJUDAH \nIt's done. \nJudah looks to the camera obscura's table. The blood from the Crow has completely covered the table's concave surface, filling it to the brim like liquid in a shallow bowl. The end result is an eerie reflecting pool. \nAS WE WATCH, THE IMAGE OF THE CLOUDS \ncast by the camera lens onto the table begins to ripple and dissolve, only to be replaced by Judah's own, shimmering reflection. \nBACK TO SCENE \nWith a shaking hand, Judah dips his fingers into the pooling blood and begins to paint his face. A swatch of blood over one eye, then a swatch over the other. A long, bloody smear over his lips... \nThe action harkens back to the moment when Sarah painted Ashe's face - a parallel ritual turned on its head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT \nJudah turns towards us, his transformation now complete. We see that he has painted himself a parody of Ashe's irony mask in the Crow's own blood. \nSARAH \nwatches with a mixture of mounting horror and morbid curiousity. \nJUDAH \nscoops up a handful of the Crow's blood and brings it to his lips. \nCLOSE ON JUDAH'S LIPS \nas he drinks, letting the overflow trickle down over his chin and neck. \nCLOSE ON JUDAH'S FACE \nhis once-pallid features now glow with a kind of beatific radiance. \nWE RISE UP \nfrom Judah, up and up into the darkest reaches of his tower. Judah is LAUGHING, laughing in the face of Death itself. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JUDAH'S TOWER - STREET \nAshe lies amidst a field of shimmering glass shards and flowers. \nTHE MASKED CELEBRANTS \nslowly gather around Ashe, craning their necks for a view of the fallen angel. \nCLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE \nRelaxed, peaceful, even. For a moment, we aren't sure whether or not Ashe's soul has fled. \nThe peripheral noise from the street festival dies away. We're in the eye of the hurricane now. Once again, time seems to shudder to a stop. And the only thing we hear are... \nTHE CROWS \nThousands of them, filling the heavens with their KEENING WAILS. \nAshe slowly opens his eyes, tentative. When you're this deep in the bosom of bliss, the last thing you want to do is waken, but waken he does... \nASHE'S POV - THE SKY ABOVE JUDAH'S TOWER \nis black with crows. And endless army of carrion-creatures, swirling madly about. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAshe sits up, stares at the crows, fascinated, frightened. Then his eyes fall to the faces of the people around him. We are in dream-time now, blurring the edges of reality. \nA CHILD \nASHE \nDanny, wait...! \nWHAM! Ashe bolts up from the bed of flowers and glass. The spell is broken. Was he dreaming...? \nNo, there's Danny slipping back into the crows, the mask pulled down over his face once again. \nAshe reaches for Danny, spinning him around, pulling off the mask... \n...only it's not Danny! It's a drunken DWARF with fucked-up teeth who's laughing his ass of at Ashe. Ashe recoils, horrified, then spins around, suddenly finding himself face to face with... \nJUDAH \nstanding just a few yards away, emerging from the doorway of his tower. He got the anti-Crow blood mask on his face. His eyes are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a feral snarl. In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his campanile. \nJudah grabs Ashe by the lapels of his coat, draging him close so they're eye to eye -- close enough to breathe the same beath -- two sides of a coin. \nJUDAH \nTell me, Ashe. Do you every get the feeling we're all just dead men on leave? \nASHE \n(seething with hatred) \nJudah. \nJUDAH \nIn the flesh. \nJudah flings Ashe backwards... \nAshe reaches his hand into his coat, pulling out a .45. He FIRES into Judah's chest - once, twice, thrice... \nJudah doesn't even stagger, he just keeps on grinning. Wisps of smoke rise up from the holes in his chest. \nAshe stares at Judah, dumbfounded. \nASHE \nWhat...are...you? \nJUDAH \nI'm your shadow, Ashe. Every angel's got a devil. Didn't you know that? Or maybe you just slept your way through Sunday school? \nJudah lashes out with the rope. Ashe spins and falters. Incredibly, he finds himself feeling pain. \nJudah follows with a series of blows, each more savage than the next, driving Ashe back... \nAshe stumbles, falls to his hands and knees. He reaches to his mouth, his hand comes away spattered with blood. Ashe shakes his head to clear it. \nJudah kicks Ashe in the face, knocking him onto his back... \n...but Ashe springs back to his feet. He tries to strike Judah. Judah catches Ashe's hand and squeezes tight. We hear bones snapping. \nCRACK! Judah smashes out with his other fist, Ashe spins around and collapses... \nAshe tries to push himself up by his hands. He coughs, spitting up more blood, crawls forward... \nASHE \nWhat... did you do to me...? \nJUDAH \nI've tasted the blood of the Crow and taken your power. \nWHOOSH! Judah whips the rope about, snapping the end around Ashe's neck, dragging him off his feet. \nJudah pulls Ashe forward, crouching over him like a spider ready to devour its prey. \nJUDAH \nYou're flesh and blood now, Ashe. You can die like any other man. \nASHE \nGo to hell. \nJUDAH \nAlready been there. And I must confess, I liked what I saw. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUDAH'S TOWER - NIGHT \nSarah sobs quietly, still chained to the pillar. A figure suddenly appears at her side -- Sibyl. Sarah looks up... \nNow don't we look pretty... \nAshe struggles, choking, causing... \nTHE TATTERED PAINTING \nof Danny's that Ashe had kept in his coat pocket to fall free. It flutters to the ground, landing at Judah's feet. \nJudah kneels, picking it up. As he unfolds the painting, we see that it has been stained with Ashe's own blood. He tilts it this way and that -- as if he were appraising the craftsmanship of the piece. \nJUDAH \nNice. If you prick him, does he not bleed? \nJudah looks up at Ashe, his eyes full of crazed humor, then he very deliberately tears the painting to shreds, letting the pieces fall away into the night wind. \nJudah reaches for metal rod, lashing out at Ashe's bare, bloodied back... \nWHACK! Ashe SCREAMS. Judah is hell-bent on beating Ashe into oblivion. With every stroke of the switch the crowd CHEERS. \nCLOSE ON ASHE \nHis eyes are rolling to whites as consciousness begins to recede... \nASHE'S POV \nThe swirling faces of the masked celebrants, with Judah front and center. Mob mentality, everyone drunk and LAUGHING, jeering at Ashe, the dangling fool. It's a scene out of Hell... \n.. and behind Judah, a familiar figure pushing her way to the front of the crowd... \nSARAH \nlunges forward, clutching the misericord, shoving a reveller aside... \nSARAH \nGet away from him! \nJudah turns. Sarah drives the misericord into Judah's eye. Judah, momentarily blinded, falls back... \nSarah unlashes the end of the chain from the hydrant... \nASHE \nfalls to the street as the chain CLATTERS over the street lamp. He unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself back up... \nASHE \nSarah, get back! \nToo late. Judah has torn the misericord from his eye. He rushes up to Sarah and... \n...THUNK! Drives it deep into her chest. \nASHE \nSARAH!!! \nSarah gasps, drops to her knees, clutching at the dagger's handle. She pulls the misericord out. Blood begins to well up from the wound. She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then falls back. \nSilence now as the crowd begins to back away. The mood has shifted. \nAshe drops by Sarah's side. She stares up at the sky, eyes wide with wonder... \nSARAH \nThe crows...I can see them coming... \nSARAH'S POV \nOnce again, the crows are wheeling around the ceiling of the sky. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAshe looks up at Judah, fueled by a righteous rage that's been burning since the moment of his resurrection. He rises. All reason is gone. The only think that remains for Ashe is an unbridled animal fury. \nAshe launches himself at Judah, sending the villain tumbling back into a nest of scaffolding. One of the pipes punches clear through Judah's chest, impaling him! \nJudah hangs there, transfixed like a butterfly with a pin stuck through it. He struggles to pull himself from the piping, but even so, he's laughing hysterically... \nJUDAH \nYou can't stop me anymore, Ashe. You don't have the power. \nAshe's eyes boil with hatred. \nASHE \nIf it were just me, you'd be right, Judah. But I have an eternity of pain to call upon... \nAshe lifts his hands up, exposing his bleeding palms. \n...nothing can keep them apart. \n(her voice fading) \n...nothing. \nAshe nods, trying to let this thought reassure him. It's the only thing he has left to cling to. \nSARAH'S POV \nAshe's face, surrounded by a nimbus of light. We're falling away from him. Down, down, down. And as we fall, we hear a FLUTTERING OF WINGS. \nON SARAH'S FACE \nHer eyes lose focus. Her head goes slack in Ashe's arms. She's gone. \nAshe lowers his lips to her, kissing her one final time. \nAshe cradles Sarah's lifeless body in his arms, gently rocking back and forth, tears streaming down his cheeks. \nAnd as we pull back from them, we realize that the scene mirrors the prophetic image from Sarah's own painting - the woman dying in the arms of her lover, surrounded by a gallery of skull-masked celebrants. \nAshe stands, lifting Sarah in his arms. He turns to leave... \nTHE DAY OF THE DEAD CROWD \nslowly part for him, revealing a path of marigold petals leading away down the street. It's almost as if, by silent consensus, the crowd has come to understand what has happened here this night. \nASHE \nmoves through the crowd carrying Sarah in his arms. The people close ranks behind him and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT \nSibyl stands over the camera obscura. On the table's focusing surface we see the street below. \nASHE \nis carrying Sarah in his arms, moving through the crowd of silent witnesses. \nSIBYL \nnods to herself, satisfied. We see what might be a trace of a smile cross her lips. \nSibyl turns and exits the camera obscura. \nINT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT \nSibyl approaches the table where the stag beetle is tethered. Removing a pair of scissors from within her robes, Sibyl cuts the thread which binds the beetle. \nTHE STAG BEETLE, \nfree at last, quickly scurries out of the box and across the table, disappearing into the shadows. \nSibyl follows suit, gathering her robes about her and stepping on into the darkness. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. INNER-CITY CHURCH - DAWN \nThe same church we visited the night before. Ashe, still carrying Sarah in his arms, enters the sanctuary. \nThe church is aglow with candles. Ashe lays Sarah's body down in front of the offrenda, folding her arms across her chest, leaving her in a state of repose. He stands, taking in one last look. \nAs Ashe moves to leave, he sees the elderly priest he had spoken to earlier. \nPRIEST \nWhy are you still here? \nASHE \nBecause I have nowhere left to go. \nAshe steps past the priest, moving towards the doorway and the daylight beyond. \nPRIEST \nWhat will you do, then? \nASHE \n(looking back) \nThis city is filled with shadows. One more won't make it any darker. \nEXT. CHURCH - DAWN \nAshe exits the church, finding haven in a shadowed doorway. He reaches into his pocket, removing the wedding ring Sarah had given to him... \n", "test1_input": "Ashe gasps. He stares down at the incongruous sight of a knife-handle stickout out from his sternum, then he yanks the knife back out. No pain. No wound. A moment of shock, then... \nASHE \n(looking at her, a tortured whisper) \nI'm dreaming this. \nSarah tries to reach for Ashe again. He tears away from her, flinging her back and running for the door. \nEXT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT \nAshe stumbles from the doorway out onto the sidewalk. He rushes blindly up the street. \nCAMERA WHIP-PANS \nfrom the fleeing Ashe to Sarah's window. On a pillar outside, the Crow is waiting... \nINT.

BRIDGE/GARAGE - NIGHT \nBeneath the arching span of a freeway bridge is a series of corrugated iron sheds. CAMERA FOLLOWS as Ashe, exhausted fro his run, makes his way towards them. The Crow flies on ahead, landing next to one of the doors, beckoning... \nAshe slides one of the RATTLING doors open... \nINT. GARAGE - NIGHT \nAs light spills in, we catch a glimpse of the humble auto repair garage - tools, a few wrecks-in-progress, a motorcycle... \nCAMERA ISOLATES a tempera painting on the floor that's been executed on construction paper. A brush and a collection of paint canisters are scattered around it, like the kind you might find in a primary school art class. Ashe kneels next to the painting... \nCLOSE ON PAINTING \nAn image rendered by a child's optimistic imagination - a crude father and sone, respectively labeled \"DAD\" and \"ME\". A FOOTPRINT mars the otherwise perfect memento. Ashe touches the figure labeled \"ME\", which triggers... \nINT. GARAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nAshe is working beneath a car. Danny is sprawled on the floor. He holds up the painting in question. \nDANNY \nHey, Dad...what color should I make the sun? \nASHE \nBlue. \nDANNY \nThere's no such thing. \nASHE \n(PLAYFUL) \nNo. Well there should be. \nJust then we hear a GUNSHOT coming from outside. \nDANNY \n(wide eyed) \nWhat was that? \nDanny climbs to his feet, moves outside... \nASHE \nDanny, wait! \nAshe slides out from under the car. \nEXT. GARAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nFrom the back doorway, Ashe and Danny catch sight of Curve and his crew executing someone beneath the freeway overpass. Curve's face is splattered with blood.

Finally, he sinks to his knees, his face a mask of tears. \nAshe spins, murderous rage in his eyes. Never startle an animal, right? \nSARAH \nstands in the doorway. \nASHE \nWhy are you here? \nSARAH \nI don't know. \nShe stops herself -- she does know, she just didn't want to admit it to herself. \nSARAH \nI want to help you. I need to. \nSarah approaches, dropping by Ashe's side. She sees Danny's painting which Ashe cradles protectively. \nAshe looks up at Sarah, his eyes full of questions. \nASHE \nEverything's so confused... \n(anguished, touching the drawing) \nDanny... \nSARAH \nHe's not here anymore. \nSarah draws closer, touched by Ashe's inner struggle. She reaches out to him, drawing him into her arms. He stares up at her, eyes distant. \nASHE \nThere's no moon... \nSarah touches Ashe's face, calming him, trying to reach through his pain. \nSARAH \nYou've been given another chance, Ashe -- to put the wrong things right... \nSarah's eyes drop to the canisters of paint which have been scattered nearby. She reaches for the canister of white and unscrews the lid, dipping her fingers inside... \nSarah's re-creation of the irony war mask has an oddly ritualistic feel to it. Yet the act is also quite erotic, for the mutual attraction between these two battered souls is almost palpable. \nAs Sarah continues to speak, she begins to paint Ashe's face using Danny's art supplies. \nWe see this transformation in bits and pieces - an eye here, fingers dipping into the canister of white there, ruby lips being smeared with black... \n...the face that is taking shape is both similar to and different from Eric's. It's the legacy of the Crow, as funneled through Ashe's own, unique pain. \nSARAH \nI believe there've always been people like you... \nSarah has finished. She sits back, surveying her work... \nSARAH \nIt's the pain that brings people back. It makes us strong again. \nCLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE as he turns towards us.

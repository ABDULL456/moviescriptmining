The marines begin cuffing the Army Guards to the radiator and taping their mouths. 
SGT.  CRISP Sorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises. 
HUMMEL (to Callahan) Ten men who could have been terrorists are out there doing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel.  Here you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator.  This is not a tight ship.  I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning.

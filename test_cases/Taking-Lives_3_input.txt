ON GRACE 
Running.   Equally tireless.      Locked onto Asher like a missile. Grace is slowly gaining on Asher. 
Laval behind her.      Running.   Screaming in his radio. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
(subtitled French) We're heading East. Form a line at Seychelles. A dozen UNIFORMS charge through the crowd. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY 
Police RADIOS busy with CHATTER. UNIFORMS clear a path for two PATROL CARS. SIRENS WHOOP as they coast in, TAP bumpers, blocking the intersection. POLICE OFFICERS form a formidable skirmish line. SHOUTING for REVELERS to move aside. 
EXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT 
Asher running. Gun in his pocket. Elbowing his way through the crowd. Asher REACTS. He sees the gauntlet of UNIFORMS and PATROL CARS blocking the intersection ahead. Asher shoves his hand in his pocket... 
BOOM!   BOOM-BOOM!     POP-POP-POP! 
Thunderous GUNFIRE. Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS and WHISTLES. It's not gunfire... 
TILT UP. 
FIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of fire. Rivers of sparks. Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought she was dead for a second. Grace looking around for Asher. Laval reaches her. 
GRACE 
Shit.     You see him? POP-POP-BOOM! More fireworks.         Laval gestures for some Uniforms to spread out.

A SHRILL SCREAM O.S. 
From an apartment building. Grace runs into the building. Laval follows her. 
INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Grace and Laval running.   More SCREAMING O.S.    They run upstairs. 
INT. APARTMENT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
An UPSET WOMAN is in the hall, standing by the just-been kicked-in door of her apartment. Grace and Laval charge inside. 
INT. UPSET WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the balcony has been shattered. Below and beyond is a long rooftop. Madly lit by a swirl of bright lights. A huge outdoor dance floor throbs with energy in a park along the St. Lawrence River. 
GRACE SEES -- 
ASHER jump from the far end of the roof. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Laval will go no further. Grace gets a running start, jumps from the apartment window, tucks and rolls. On her feet again, Grace sprints along the roof. FIREWORKS BOOM and POP overhead.   THUMPING TECHNO. Grace reaches the edge of the roof.     REACTS.   Reynaud has caught up with her. 
EXT. RIVER PARK - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT 
Asher has vanished into a vast sea of DANCERS, adorned with strobing and glowing jewelry. The BEAT dominates all sound. 
EXT. RIVER PARK - NIGHT 
Grace and Reynaud trade looks, tenacious street cops at heart, they holster their guns and jump into the crowd. 
FIND ASHER -- 
A dozen yards away. He stalks a dancing RAVER who wears a huge bundle of glowing necklaces. Asher snatches necklaces.   Disappears into a wall of 
DANCERS. 
FIND GRACE -- 
She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher. Grace GLIMPSES the back of Asher's head. Grace and Reynaud tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a bonding moment. Asher is an arm's length ahead of Grace. She reaches out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher turns... 
IT'S NOT ASHER. 
Grace shoves him aside and moves on. She SEES a disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through the crowd. Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance.    They cleave through ONLOOKERS to reveal... 
A FIGHT 
Two drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace looks around; no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the Jocks, hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in and arrest the two Jocks. Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration.    He looks at Grace, they know they've been beaten. 
EXT. RIVER PARK - CRANE SHOT - NIGHT 
PULL BACK to reveal Grace and Reynaud surrounded by an ocean of bodies in motion. 
CAMERA FINDS A DANCER. 
Some dude with his shirt off grinds on three HOTTIES. 
PUSH IN ON THE DANCER. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
It's Asher. His face is an evil green from his mane of pilfered gel glow necklaces. Red plastic cup in hand, Asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity. 
ASHER'S EYES 
Dangerous and cold.     They track Grace as she moves through the crowd. Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with her. Grace searching the crowd.    Scanning faces. Grace passes within feet of Asher. Asher smirks.     Now another hottie wants a kiss.   Asher complies. 
INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT 
It's late. Costa has a beer, his nose bandaged. INSPECTORS finish up questioning PATRONS. Grace enters, crosses to Costa. She's tense, wound tight. 
GRACE (O.S.)

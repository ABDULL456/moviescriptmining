Sue shakes her head, sympathetic. 
SUE Ben, you got what we all wanted. You need to stay here.  It's too dangerous. 
She heads off.  Ben watches her go, helpless. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT 
Ben steps back into this ravaged room.  Through the shattered window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away.  A hard beat. 
BEN What...what have I done? 
EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT 
Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and turn, gaining on him, bearing down.  Cars slow, stop.  More people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight. 
INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Eerily silent.  Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN.  He hears a footstep.  But the room is EMPTY.  No sign of Doom even.  A beat.  He hears a CREAK.  Another CREAK, closer. And... 
A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT.  It goes taut, clearly being manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND.  Sue APPEARS next to Reed, tube in hand.  She tries to stay calm. 
SUE What has he done to you? 
Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness. 
DOOM (O.S.) How romantic. 
SUE Victor, please -- 
DOOM It's Doctor Doom to you. 
He steps closer.  Electrodes course over his metal skin. 
SUE We know the machine works.  It worked on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can turn you back -- 
DOOM Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts? 
She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her. 
SUE Victor.  You always thought you were god. 
Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast. 
DOOM Sue please, let's not fight. 
SUE No, Victor... Let's. 
She HURLS a force-field at him.  It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him back a half-step.  But he simply shakes it off, and steps up. Too powerful.  He smiles.  His arms CRACKLE with electricity. 
DOOM Susan...... You're fired. 
BOOM!  He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back. She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING to the floor.  As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her strength to...GO INVISIBLE. 
DOOM (CONT'D) Marco... 
A hanging beat.  We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him. 
DOOM (CONT'D) Polo. 
He SPINS, GRABS her!  Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to the ground beside Reed.  She lays there, beaten, visible. 
In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and out.  Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through the machine).  Reed looks up.  Could it be...? 
EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT 
Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet behind him.  He's running out of options, when he spots: 
A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.  Thinking fast, Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge. VWOOSH!  The flames ignite and spread quickly. 
He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes in on him.  Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit -- 
JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.  As he tumbles through the air, we CUT BACK TO -- 
INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
From their vantage point, they see the missile explode. Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck. 
Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN.  It takes every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes a CRACCCKKKKING sound. 
DOOM One more down.  Now it's just the scientist and his specimen. 
Sue and Reed lock eyes.  Reed tries to move his mouth.  He has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips and get the words out. 
REED Sue.  The only thing I ever knew without thinking was... (his lips fully freezing) I...love... 
He starts to say "you," but his lips FREEZE, mid-word.  Sue whispers to him: 
SUE Me too, Reed. 
Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow. 
DOOM (quiet, cruel) And so four became none.  It's my time now. 
BOOOOM!  An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM!  SMASH!

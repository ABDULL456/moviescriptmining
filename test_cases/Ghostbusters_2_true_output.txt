The Ghostbusters ENTER SHOT and play their flashlights across the huge egg sitting atop the haystack. 
RAY (excited) What'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken egg!  Gimme a hand, Winston! 
WIDER ANGLE 
As Ray and Winston ease the egg down off the haystack.  Peter holds his PKE meter up to it. 
PETER Look, if this is a werechicken egg, 
CLOSER ANGLE -- METER 
Nothing registers on the meter. 
PETER (CONT) ...how come there's no PKE reading? 
THREESHOT 
Ray and Winston still hold giant egg. 
RAY (looking at meter in Peter's hand) I dunno... that is strange. 
WINSTON Let's get it back to Headquarters and run some tests.  Then maybe we'll have some answers. 
ON RAY 
RAY Oh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and I'm gonna find it. 
ON PETER AND SLIMER 
PETER (throws up his hands with heavy SIGH) I'll take it.  C'mon, Slimer. 
They take egg from Ray and Winston and start back toward Ecto-l.

PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT \nFramed in the large picture window stands JACK CARTER, alone, looking out at the night. He turns away as the heavy satin curtains close, wiping him from view. \nINT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual orgy. \nGERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA, is curled up beside him. \nSID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control, has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother. \nJack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair. \nClunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand. \nGERALD (removing the cigar from his mouth) Bollock naked with his socks still on? \nSID (thoughtfully) They do that up North. \nGERALD What for? Protective purposes? \nHe laughs. \nSID Ask me? \nGERALD Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground. \nCarter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet. Lights and sweet music happen when he opens it. \nClunk. The slide changes. \nSID Must be a bloody contortionist \nStill looking at the screen, Gerald continues. \nGERALD We don't want you to go up the North, Jack. \nJack and Anna look at each other momentarily. There is definitely something between them. \nJACK No. \nClunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD (groans) Not suede boots! \nSID Knock it off, Gerald. \nGERALD What? And get the clap? \nClunk. The slide changes. \n", "test1_true": "Clunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD What's that? A python. \nSid laughs raucously.  Clunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD What are you going for? \nJACK To find out what happened. \nClunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD Some hard nuts operate up there, Jack. They won't take kindly to someone from London poking his bugle in. \nJACK Too bad. \nGERALD I smell trouble, boy. \nClunk. The slide changes. \nSID The law was satisfied. \nJACK Since when was that good enough? \nClunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD Think again, Jack. \nJACK I will. \nEXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY \nExpress train plunges into a tunnel Blackness. \nBEGIN TITLES: \nINT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY \nThe compartment is full. Jack Carter sits in one corner, reading a Raymond Chandler paperback, Farewell My Lovely. \nEXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY \nThe train speeds northwards. In the distance the stacks of a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown smoke. \nINT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - DAY \nCarter steadies himself as he comes along the corridor. \nEXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY \nA massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past. Its mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect. \nINT.

Evening light cuts across the track as the train hurtles on. \nINT. TRAIN RESTAURANT CAR - EVENING \nCarter pours himself a glass of water and takes out a small phial of brown pills.

He looks nervously around and speaks to Carter quietly. \nKEITH Heard of a man called Thorpe? \nCARTER Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time. \nKEITH (picking up Carter's money) That's what he was saying about you. \nKeith takes the money to the till. The music grinds away. Keith returns. \nKEITH Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake. \nCARTER That's nice. What'd you tell him? \nKEITH Nowt. \nCARTER Good lad. \nCarter watches the singer, then finishes his drink. \nCARTER See you later. \nKEITH Where you off to? \nCARTER (smiling) Las Vegas. \nCarter makes for the door. The singer is now moving through the tables. She pauses to give some man a kiss. Everybody cheers. \nThe woman sitting with the man snaps. She picks up his glass of beer and throws it over the singer; then grabs her hair and pulls her to the ground. \nCarter stops to watch. The two women roll on the floor, punching and scratching. \nCarter smiles and leaves. \nEXT. ALLEY IN TOWN CENTRE - NIGHT \nOn the corner is a neon-lit snack bar. Doreen and another young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes. Somewhere a drunk is singing. His voice echoes up the alley. \nCarter draws alongside and notices Doreen. He stops and watches her. She hasn't seen him so he goes to the window and knocks on it. She looks up and he beckons her outside. Reluctantly, she comes. \nCARTER (gently) You all right now? \nDOREEN Yeah. \nCARTER You coming to South America? \nDOREEN No. \nCarter's hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection. \nCARTER Where you going to live, then? \nDOREEN At me friend's house. \nCARTER Where's that? \nDOREEN Wilton Estate. \nCARTER Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that? \nDoreen nods. \nCARTER Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again. (He pulls out a wad of money, and peels off some notes.) There. Go and get your hair done. \n", "test2_true": "He lifts her chin with his finger and looks at her. \nCARTER Be good. And don't trust boys. \nDoreen blushes and turns away. She rushes back to the snack bar with the money to show her friend. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe front door opens and Carter enters. \nStanding on the hall table is a small wooden casket with an envelope taped to it. Carter pockets the envelope and picks up the casket. \nEDNA (O.S.) That was left for you this evening. \nCarter walks past her into the sitting room. \nEDNA What is it? \nCARTER My brother, Frank. \nEDNA Is he staying the night? \nCARTER Funny. (He puts the casket on a side table.) Can I phone London? \nEDNA It'll cost you. \nINT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnna is undressing. She's alone. Pulling the short black- silk underslip over her head, she stands in front of a long mirror, clad only in black panties, bra and tights. She looks at herself appreciatively. The phone rings. She flops on the bed and picks up the receiver. \nANNA Hello. \nA voice speaks on the end of the line. \nANNA How I miss you. (She stretches herself out sexily and smiles.) Stop it, darling. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nIt's a cosy room. Carter is on the telephone. EDNA sits in a rocking chair. \nCARTER (looking at Edna) I fancy you. I wish I was touching you right now... \nEdna turns towards him. Carter fixes her with his eyes. Edna rocks herself gently. Carter continues softly. \nCARTER ...making love to you. I want to stroke you and kiss you all over. Where are you? \nINT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnna is lying full-length on the bed. \nANNA In the bedroom. \nCarter speaks on the other end. \nANNA My black underwear. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nEdna rocks backwards and forwards. \nCARTER (quietly) The sexy, silk ones? \nAnna replies. He continues softly. \nCARTER Take your bra off. (pause) No, go on. \n", "test2_id": 2968, "test3_input": "EXT. BOARDING HOUSE FRONT - DAY \nCarter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he scarpers for the pavement.  Carter hits the Jaguar's door at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he is out of sight. \nCon comes running. Peter is looking at the damage. \nPETER Where were you, then? \nCon sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased. \nCON Bollocks. \nEXT. BACK STREET - DAY \nCarter pulls up outside a house and gets out. He takes the washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected garden. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY \nCarter presses the bell. The door's opened by a young man, SHAMIR. \nCARTER Keith in? \nSHAMIR (shouts) Keith. \nNo answer. Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall. \nCARTER (O.S.) Which is his room? \nINT. KEITH'S ROOM - DAY \nCarter enters and closes the door. Keith is in a had way, his face like a piece of raw steak. He is lying on a bed, still in the clothes of the night before. \nCARTER What happened to you, then? \nKEITH How'd you find me? \nKeith lifts his head painfully from the pillow. \nCARTER Did they give you a rough time? \nKEITH No. (He lowers his head to the pillow.) You bastard. You knew they'd come back. \nCARTER No, I didn't, (pause) Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry? \nKEITH Get knotted. \nCARTER All right. All right. I want to square things with you first. \nKEITH Oh yes? How? \nCarter takes out of his wad of money. Keith's bloodshot eyes watch him through the surrounding puff of flesh. \nKEITH Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it? \nCARTER I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate. \nHe throws some money on the bed. Keith tries to kick it off, but it's too painful. He clutches his testicles. \nKEITH Frank said you were a shit and he was bloody well right. \nCarter turns to leave.  Keith continues, crying and angry. \nKEITH You even screwed his wife, didn't you? \nCarter shuts the door, leaving Keith shouting after him. \n", "test3_true": "He falls back on to the bed, crying out in pain. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY \nA wide road runs alongside the Tyne. It passes below the vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city. A carpark lies at the foot of the 'Iron Bridge'. Carter pulls up and parks. He gets out and moves quickly. \nEXT. THE IRON BRIDGE - DAY \nThe bridge is a, massive structure. The traffic lanes are flanked each side by pedestrian walkways. It is here that Carter and Margaret have arranged to meet. \nCARTER How were things between you and Frank? \nMARGARET He was all right to me. \nCARTER Nothing more? Just another feller? \nMARGARET Nicer than most. \nCARTER But he was just another feller, wasn't he? \nMARGARET Yes. \nCARTER Though nicer than most? \nMARGARET Yes. I can't help the way I am. \nCARTER (ignoring the statement) Why'd you see him so regular? \nMARGARET Once a week? \nCARTER I call that regular. \nMARGARET He was gentlemanly. I like that. \nCARTER Once a week you like a gentleman? \nMARGARET (angrily) Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not. (She turns and walks slowly along the bridge.) Why all the bloody needle? \nCARTER What was bugging Frank? \nMARGARET He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both! (pause) He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, (pause) I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday. (She stops and looks over the bridge.) He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do. \nThey look at each other for a moment. Carter shakes his head. He gently takes the sunglasses from Margaret's face and folds them up. \nCARTER I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that. (pause) I'm the villain in the family, remember? \nMARGARET It's the truth. \nCarter snaps her glasses in two and throws them away. \nMARGARET It is. Honestly. \nCARTER (shouting) You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him? \nMARGARET I don't know nothing. \nCarter holds her arm. She winces like she's been hit before. \nCARTER Listen, the only reason I came back to this craphole was to find out who did it. And I won't leave until I do. You understand? \nBehind Carter Peter's Jaguar comes slowly along the bridge. It stops. The passenger side is a gaping hole. \nCON Hello, Jack. \nCarter swings round to see them, then swings angrily back to Margaret. \n", "test3_id": 2969}

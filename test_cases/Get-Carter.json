{"train": "A chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the outskirts of the city appear. \nINT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe train moves slowly along the platform and stops. Carter collects his coat and briefcase from the rack. \nEXT. NEWCASTLE STATION - NIGHT \nThe street is fairly deserted. \nCarter exits with other passengers from the train. He pauses and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite. \nINT. THE LONG BAR - NIGHT \nA couple of youths are playing records on the juke box. An old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper. \nCarter enters through the swing door and a weedy BARMAN comes to serve him. \nCARTER Pint of bitter. \nThe barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the beer. Carter snaps his fingers at him. \nCARTER In a thin glass. \nThe barman sighs petulantly, transfers the beer into a thin glass and puts it on the counter. \nA telephone rings. The second barman answers it. \nBARMAN Is there a Mr Carter in the room? \nCARTER Yes. \nCarter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the receiver. \nCARTER Hello? (pause) Margaret? (pause) Why the hell aren't you here? (he lights a cigarette.) What time? (pause) Is Doreen at the house? (pause) Who's with him then? (pause) When can I see you? Will you be there tomorrow? (pause) Now listen, Margaret... \nThe line goes dead. Carter hangs up. \nINT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT \nA key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards and out through the flap. A moment later, the door opens. Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in a worker's terraced house. He closes the door and climbs the stairs. \nINT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT \nCarter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits an unseen bucket with depressing regularity. \nINT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAn unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking up. They see him and quickly drive off. \nCarter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing. \nINT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nPitch black. \nAn overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his skin made-up, like porcelain. \nCarter stands over the coffin. He gently touches his brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face. He exits, turning out the light and closing the door. \nDarkness returns. \nINT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT \nThe landlady, EDNA GARFOOT, is climbing the stairs. She's well built, sexy, experienced. Carter follows with his baggage. He watches her appreciatively from behind. \nShe seems mesmerized by what's going on. \nCARTER All right, are you? \nDoreen doesn 't answer. \nCARTER Been staying with a friend? \nDoreen nods. The undertaker coughs and thrusts another screw into the coffin. \nCARTER Sorry about your father. \nDOREEN (pause) Yeah. \nCARTER Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything? \nDOREEN (dazed) They said he was drunk. \nINT. HEARSE - DAY \nThe young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to the radio. In the driving mirror he sees the Land Rover moving slowly tip the road. It stops by the house. Two men suss the scene and drive off. \nINT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCARTER How's school? \nDOREEN I left last year. \nCARTER Oh, what you doing now? \nDOREEN Working at Woolworths. \nCARTER That must be interesting. \nDOREEN Yes. \nCarter and Doreen look at each other awkwardly. \nCARTER What you going to do? Live with Margaret? \nDoreen looks at him nervously, shakes her head and fumbles in her bag for a cigarette. \nCarter continues, slightly indignant. \nCARTER Well, why won't you come with us to South America? My fiancee won't mind, (pause) Your dad would have wanted it. \nThe undertaker puts the final screw in. \nUNDERTAKER (to colleague) Get Hughbert up, will you? (to Carter) We're ready now, sir. \nEXT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow staircase into the street. Outside Carter and Doreen wait with two men. EDDIE APPLEYARD, a middle-aged man, is wearing a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie. KEITH LACEY is a young barman who worked with Frank. \nEDDIE We weren't sure where it was taking place, like. \nCARTER Nice of you to come. \nEDDIE No. Frank was a good bloke. \nKEITH He was that. \nEDDIE One of the best. \nINT. LIMOUSINE - DAY \nMARGARET (nervously) Killed?  I don't know anything about it. \nShe moves off rapidly. Carter catches up with her. \nCARTER Really. \nMARGARET I must go. I'm in a hurry. \nCARTER I want to talk to you later. \nMARGARET I can't. \nCARTER Tomorrow morning, then? \nMargaret dithers. \nMARGARET Well, all right then. Twelve o'clock on the Iron Bridge. \nMargaret walks off as calmly as she can, her high heels clicking as she goes. Carter watches her disappear. Doreen watches too. \nINT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY \nFrank's coffin is slid inside the furnace. Flames start to lick it as the steel trap closes. \nINT. THE HALF MOON PUB - DAY \nIt's a large room with a horseshoe bar in the centre, a real boozer.  A handful of hard drinkers are already in position. \nCarter, Doreen, Keith and Eddie are sitting alone. Their table is already covered with glasses. Doreen appears to be slightly drunk on Babycham, Eddie on whisky and Keith on beer. Carter is stone-cold sober. \nEDDIE Absent friends. (He raises his glass and drinks, then continues thoughtfully.) You don't think he might have done it on purpose? \nKEITH What? You mean, like, kill himself? \nEddie and Keith look at each other. \nDoreen watches them. She is getting very upset by the conversation. \nKEITH Naw. Frank? Kill himself? You what? \nCarter stares at Keith, who is getting uncomfortable. \nKEITH I mean, what for? \nCARTER That's what I was wondering. \nKEITH Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed. \nCARTER Why would it? \nKEITH It just would. He was always the same. \nCARTER Since when did he drink whisky? \nKEITH Don't know. \nCARTER Nobody seems to know. \nDoreen is now crying openly. \nEDDIE (finishing off his drink) Bloody good bloke. One of the best. \nDOREEN (blurts out) How would you know? (She suddenly jumps up and empties her glass in Eddie's face.) Or you?  Or you? None of you knew. I knew. He was me dad. \nShe runs off out of the door crying. Keith goes to follow. Carter puts his hand out to restrain him. \nEric swings round, startled. \nERIC Good God! \nCarter smiles. \nCARTER Is he? \nERIC Jack Carter. \nCARTER (amused) Eric. Eric Paice. \nERIC What you doing around here then? \nCARTER Didn't you know this is my home town? \nERIC No, I didn't know that. \nCARTER Funny, that. \nCarter takes out his cigarettes. Eric takes one. \nERIC Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays? \nCARTER No. I'm visiting relatives. \nERIC Oh, that's nice. \nCARTER It would be. If they were still living. \nERIC Meaning what? \nCARTER A bereavement. A death in the family. \nERIC Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. \nCARTER That's all right, Eric. \nCarter flicks bis lighter and gives Eric a, light. \nERIC Well, well. Small world, isn't it? \nCARTER Very... (pause) So, who you working for these days Eric? \nERIC Oh, I'm straight. (indicating uniform) Respectable. \nCARTER (smiling) What are you doing? Advertising Martini? \nERIC Oh, you've been watching television. \nCARTER Yeah, (pause) Come off it, Eric. Who is it? \nEric smiles back. \nCARTER Brumby? \nEric shakes his head. \nCARTER Kinnear? \nEric shakes his head \nERIC What's it to you anyway? \nCARTER I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy. \nERIC You stupid shit! \nCarter walks past Ray, blowing him a kiss. \nKinnear watches with some amusement. \nKINNEAR You see what it's like these days, Jack.  You can't get the material. \nCarter looks at Eric. \nCARTER Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear. \nKINNEAR Sit down, Jack, (pause) I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them, (to girl) Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack? \nCARTER (to Glenda) Scotch, please. \nKINNEAR (to bouncer) Piss off, Ray. \nRay closes the door behind him. \nGlenda brings Carter his Scotch. He looks at her as she sits beside him. \nKINNEAR Eric told me of your bereavement. \nCARTER Yep. \nKINNEAR Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places! \nCARTER No? Funny that. Neither did I. \nKINNEAR If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better. \nCARTER Yeah. \nKINNEAR Nasty way to go. \nCARTER Yes. \nOne of the three men sitting around the table with Kinnear gets impatient. PETER, LES AND HARRY are well-heeled, middle- aged, northern businessmen. \nHARRY Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days? \nKINNEAR Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle. (He picks up his cards.) Now, where are we? \nHarry keeps a cold, wary eye on him. \nKINNEAR Oh... I think I'll stay as I am. \nHARRY (shaken) You're bluffing, you bastard! \nKINNEAR That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack? \nCARTER Right. If you can afford it. \nHARRY (to Carter) Thought you were going soon. \nCARTER Soon. When you've lost your money. Won't take long. \nHARRY Clever sod, aren't you? \nCARTER Only comparatively. \nKINNEAR Harry, I don't like to push, but could you let us know how much your hand's worth? \nHarry looks at his cards. Glenda tucks her legs up, making sure that Carter gets an eyeful. \nCARTER Really? \nGLENDA He came to see Mr Kinnear. \nCARTER No. \nCarter, getting bored, looks back at the game. \nHARRY (panicking) What's that? \nKINNEAR That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred. \nHarry sweats some more. \nHARRY Four hundred? \nKINNEAR That's right. \nHARRY You're not seeing me? \nKINNEAR No. \nHarry smiles nervously. He counts some money out. \nHARRY I'll see you, then. \nKINNEAR Calling my bluff, are you, Harry? \nHarry nods. \nGlenda speaks, but this time Carter keeps his eyes on the table. Kinnear lays out his hand \u0097 a hearts flush, queen high. \nGLENDA We went about together. \nCARTER Really? \nGLENDA Yes, while he was here. \nCARTER While he was here. You went about together? \nGLENDA He was here for four days. \nCARTER Was he? \nGLENDA Could you do me a favour? \nCARTER Yeah, I'll do you a favour. \nGLENDA Could you please put my glass on the table? \nCarter smiles and does just that. \nKINNEAR Oh, come on, Harry. I haven't won, have I? Go on, you're pulling my leg. \nKinnear leans across to pick up Harry's cards. Harry grabs them and puts them in the pack. Kinnear turns to Carter. \nKINNEAR How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on. \nHARRY Shut up. \nCarter gets up from the sofa. \nKINNEAR Not going, Jack? \nCARTER I have to. Things to see to. \nCARTER Large Scotch. \nCarter watches the singer. The customers cheer and whistle. Keith returns with the Scotch. He looks nervously around and speaks to Carter quietly. \nKEITH Heard of a man called Thorpe? \nCARTER Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time. \nKEITH (picking up Carter's money) That's what he was saying about you. \nKeith takes the money to the till. The music grinds away. Keith returns. \nKEITH Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake. \nCARTER That's nice. What'd you tell him? \nKEITH Nowt. \nCARTER Good lad. \nCarter watches the singer, then finishes his drink. \nCARTER See you later. \nKEITH Where you off to? \nCARTER (smiling) Las Vegas. \nCarter makes for the door. The singer is now moving through the tables. She pauses to give some man a kiss. Everybody cheers. \nThe woman sitting with the man snaps. She picks up his glass of beer and throws it over the singer; then grabs her hair and pulls her to the ground. \nCarter stops to watch. The two women roll on the floor, punching and scratching. \nCarter smiles and leaves. \nEXT. ALLEY IN TOWN CENTRE - NIGHT \nOn the corner is a neon-lit snack bar. Doreen and another young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes. Somewhere a drunk is singing. His voice echoes up the alley. \nCarter draws alongside and notices Doreen. He stops and watches her. She hasn't seen him so he goes to the window and knocks on it. She looks up and he beckons her outside. Reluctantly, she comes. \nCARTER (gently) You all right now? \nDOREEN Yeah. \nCARTER You coming to South America? \nDOREEN No. \nCarter's hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection. \nCARTER Where you going to live, then? \nDOREEN At me friend's house. \nCARTER Where's that? \nDOREEN Wilton Estate. \nCARTER Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that? \nDoreen nods. \nCARTER Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again. (He pulls out a wad of money, and peels off some notes.) There. Go and get your hair done. \nINT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnna unhooks her bra. There's a flash of breasts. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe scene as before. \nCARTER Now hold them. Gently. \nINT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnna's hands cover her breasts. Her head moves slowly from side to side, eyes closed. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nScene as before. \nCARTER Slowly. Imagine it's me. \nINT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnna's hand caresses the inside of her leg. Her head rolls from side to side slowly. She's breathing heavily. \nCROSS-CUT between Edna's head rocking backwards and forwards and Anna's head moving from side to side. \nCARTER (V.O.) When we're in South America, we'll make love in the sun. Roll over... and make love again... and again... For me... I fancy you... \nTHE SPEED OF THE CUTTING BUILDS. \nINT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSuddenly the door opens and Gerald comes in. He sees Anna groaning on the bed. \nGERALD What's the matter? You got gut trouble or something? \nAnna sits up abruptly and puts her hand over the receiver. \nANNA No, darling. Just doing some exercises, (into telephone) Listen, Janet, Gerald's just got in, so I must ring off. (pause) Yes. Yes. I'll come tomorrow. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nScene as before. \nCARTER Save it till Sunday. I'll be back then. \nCarter replaces the receiver. He still holds Edna's eyes. She rocks to and fro. The rocker creaks. \nThe front door bell breaks the mood. \nCARTER That'll be for me. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT \nCarter opens the door. Keith is outside. He's sweating. His tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his suit is covered with dirt. \nKEITH Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park. \nCARTER How many? \nKEITH Four of them. \nCarter pulls Keith inside and turns out the light. \nA Ford Zodiac comes along the road. It stops. Four faces peer into the darkness where they're standing. Nobody gets out. The back window winds down. Thorpe's nervous voice floats out. \nEDNA You don't look it. \nCARTER No. Really, I am. \nEDNA Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy. (She points at Thorpe.) And who's he? \nOLD WOMAN What's going on? Have you no thought for others? \nCARTER We're going inside. \nEDNA Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort? \nCARTER Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right. \nOLD WOMAN Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot. Everybody knew there'd be trouble when you moved in. \nCarter, Keith and Thorpe enter the house. \nEDNA You keep your trap shut, Ma. \nOLD WOMAN I'll send my old man to see you! \nEDNA And wouldn't he love it! \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT \nCarter, Thorpe and Keith are climbing the stairs. Carter stops to pick up Frank's casket. Edna rushes in and slams the door. \nEDNA Where do you think you're going? \nCarter opens the door to his room. \nCARTER Why don't you go and make us all a nice cup of tea? \nCarter shoves Thorpe into the room.  Keith follows. \nEDNA And what you going to do? \nCARTER Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch. \nEDNA I'll call the police. \nCARTER (He knows she fancies him) No, you won't. \nCarter closes the door. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCarter carefully places the casket on the chest of drawers. \nCARTER Well now, Thorpey. It seems I've got a secret benefactor. (He moves into the room and opens his briefcase, which is lying on the bed.) It's nice to know that. Isn't it, Keith? (He takes out a bottle of whisky.) There's only one trouble, I don't know who to thank. \nThorpe looks longingly at the bottle of Scotch. Suddenly Carter punches him hard in the stomach. He grunts and collapses into a chair. \nCARTER Now, I want to know who it is, Thorpey. \nCarter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues wearily. \nCARTER All right. If you like, Thorpey, we'll stop mucking about.  Somebody doesn't want me poking my nose into something and I happen to know what that something is. (pause) Now stand up. \nThorpe looks at him, terrified. Slowly he stands. Carter grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure. Thorpe screams. \nCARTER Who paid you to see me off? \nTHORPE I can't Jack. How can I? \nOut of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily pond.  There, he promptly throws up. \nCarter watches from behind a tree. \nHis attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out. \nCLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad. \nBRUMBY Jesus wept! \nMRS BRUMBY cowers in the passenger seat. \nMRS BRUMBY Now, Cliff, don't get mad. \nBRUMBY I'll murder the little bitch! \nMRS BRUMBY Cliff ... \nBrumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. A young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a latecomer, is stunned to see who it is. \nSANDRA Daddy! \nBRUMBY That's right, bloody Daddy. \nSANDRA I wasn't expecting you until three o'clock. \nBRUMBY And this is what you call having a few friends back for coffee, is it? \nBrumby pushes past her into the house. \nBRUMBY Running bloody riot over my bloody furniture, drinking my bloody booze... \nThe rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers out through the side door \nBRUMBY ... spewing over my fucking goldfish. \nHe aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him face-down into the lily pond. \nMrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers. \nMRS BRUMBY Cliff ... \nBrumby throws the boy out. \nBRUMBY Shut up, Phyllis. (He walks back into the house.) Sandra! \nMrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a bedroom. \nBRUMBY Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch. \nCarter pauses outside the front door and listens to the row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in. \nINT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT \nCarter passes silently through the hall into the large sitting room. Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair. \nBrumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs. \nCARTER Good evening. \nMrs Brumby jumps.  The front door is open. \nMRS BRUMBY (standing) Who are you? \nCARTER I'm an old friend of Cliff's. I want to see him. \nBrumby swings at him. Carter moves away from the punch, then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck. Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt. \nCarter walks into the hall and out of the front door. \nCARTER Good night, Mrs Brumby. \nEXT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT \nCarter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place. He finds the front door unlocked. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT \nCarter enters cautiously. There is no sound. He closes the door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs. Still there is no sound. He waits. A sudden rustle attracts his attention. Quietly, he moves to the sitting-room door. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nCarter switches on the light. Edna is pressed against the far wall, holding a poker. Her dress is torn and her hair dishevelled. When she sees Carter, she sighs with relief. \nEDNA You sod. \nCARTER They came back? \nEDNA (sarcastically) No. \nCarter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap. Edna looks at her torn dress. \nEDNA Look at this. You bastard. \nCarter puts the glass on the table. \nEDNA You don't care a stuff, do you? \nCarter takes out his phial of pills. \nCARTER I'll buy you another. \nCarter swallows a pill. \nEDNA What about the lad? They took him away. \nCarter shrugs his shoulders. \nEDNA What'll they do to him? \nCARTER Don't ask me. \nEdna rubs her wrists. \nEDNA They bloody hurt me. \nCARTER You're lucky. They kill as well. \nEDNA (mocking him) And what about you? Did you kill Brumby? \nCarter shakes his head. \nEDNA Thorpey nearly died laughing. \nCARTER That little shit! \nEDNA What about Keith? \nCARTER What about Keith? \nEDNA What you going to do? \nCARTER No. I'm not tired, (pause) Do you eat breakfast? \nEdna laughs. They start to make love. Gently. Below the undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside it, Carter's shotgun. Beyond is the bedroom door. It opens slowly and the two men enter. Only their legs are visible. \nCON (O.S.) Put us in it, Jack. \nCarter is off the bed, and Edna, in a flash. Edna screams and tries to stop the bedclothes following Carter on to the floor. Peter and Con stand beside the bed smiling. Peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide- bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf. His hair is bleached blond. Con is more traditional, more butch. He's in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie. Both are in their thirties. \nPETER Don't let us interrupt you, Jack. \nCARTER I might have guessed. \nCON Sorry about this. But there you are. Orders are orders. \nCARTER And what orders would they be, Con? \nCarter's hand runs over the carpet. It's going towards the chamber pot instead of the gun. \nCON Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself. \nPETER We've got to take you back to London. \nCON He said it'd be doing him a big favour. \nCarter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on towards the gun. \nCON We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid. \nPETER But they have to be diplomatic. \nCarter pulls out the gun and jumps up. \nCARTER Right. Now take me back to London. \nCON (smiling) It'd be best if you got dressed first. \nCarter moves around the bed towards them. He's naked. \nCON Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it. \nPETER The gun he means. \nBoth men are laughing. \nCARTER Out. \nPeter and Con back down the stairs. Peter looks up at Carter's cock. \nPETER If Anna could see you now. \nCARTER Out. \nCON Now, Jack. Be reasonable. You know we're going to take you back - sooner or later. \nCARTER Out. \nEXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY \nCon is the first to emerge from the front door. \nCON Mind you don't catch cold. \nPeter follows. \nPETER I hope she's got understanding neighbours. \nEXT. BOARDING HOUSE FRONT - DAY \nCarter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he scarpers for the pavement.  Carter hits the Jaguar's door at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he is out of sight. \nCon comes running. Peter is looking at the damage. \nPETER Where were you, then? \nCon sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased. \nCON Bollocks. \nEXT. BACK STREET - DAY \nCarter pulls up outside a house and gets out. He takes the washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected garden. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY \nCarter presses the bell. The door's opened by a young man, SHAMIR. \nCARTER Keith in? \nSHAMIR (shouts) Keith. \nNo answer. Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall. \nCARTER (O.S.) Which is his room? \nINT. KEITH'S ROOM - DAY \nCarter enters and closes the door. Keith is in a had way, his face like a piece of raw steak. He is lying on a bed, still in the clothes of the night before. \nCARTER What happened to you, then? \nKEITH How'd you find me? \nKeith lifts his head painfully from the pillow. \nCARTER Did they give you a rough time? \nKEITH No. (He lowers his head to the pillow.) You bastard. You knew they'd come back. \nCARTER No, I didn't, (pause) Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry? \nKEITH Get knotted. \nCARTER All right. All right. I want to square things with you first. \nKEITH Oh yes? How? \nCarter takes out of his wad of money. Keith's bloodshot eyes watch him through the surrounding puff of flesh. \nKEITH Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it? \nCARTER I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate. \nHe throws some money on the bed. Keith tries to kick it off, but it's too painful. He clutches his testicles. \nKEITH Frank said you were a shit and he was bloody well right. \nCarter turns to leave.  Keith continues, crying and angry. \nKEITH You even screwed his wife, didn't you? \nCarter shuts the door, leaving Keith shouting after him. \nGLENDA Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant. \nCarter plays with her hair. \nCARTER Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out? \nGLENDA He won't. He thinks I'm simple. \nCarter kisses her neck. \nCARTER What does he want that bloody great country place for? \nGLENDA (knowingly) Entertaining. \nCARTER What kind of entertaining? \nGLENDA Now you're asking. \nCarter looks at the film projector by the bed and points. \nCARTER Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap? \nGLENDA (giggling) Especially when I play the lead. \nCarter wraps his arms about her. \nCARTER Did Kinnear say anything? After I'd left the other night? \nGlenda sits up sharply. \nGLENDA That's why you waited for me. \nCARTER (kissing her on the neck) Not entirely. No. \nGLENDA You sure about that? \nCARTER Sure I'm sure. \nGlenda pushes him away and gets out of the bed. \nGLENDA You bastard. \nGlenda leaves for the bathroom. Carter, curious, looks at the film projector. It's loaded. He switches it on. A beam of light hits the opposite wall. He settles down to watch the film. The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'.  A zoom back reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk. This is followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school uniform, waiting at a bus stop. A car approaches and stops. A woman driver offers the girl a lift. The woman is Margaret. The identity of the girl not revealed. \nINT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY \nGlenda is in the bath. Lots of foam. The hot water is still running.  She's smoking. She leans forward, turning off the tap. \nINT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCarter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him. \nThe schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off. The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes in with the girl. Her school hat still hides her identity. Glenda is there to greet them. \nThe girl is very awkward. Glenda tries to make her relax, sitting her down and showing her a magazine. \nGlenda brings her into a bedroom. She takes her own top off and goes to do the same with the girl. She takes her hat off. A close-up shows that it is Doreen. \nCarter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in the film.  Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock at what she sees. She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, eventually rolling off the bed. \nThe apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar comes in. \nCarter sits up. It's Albert Swift. \nAlbert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves. Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his prize Doreen.  Carter watches. \nCarter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to the street. A blind man is at the counter placing a bet. \nEXT. JETTY - TYNE FERRY - DAY \nThe Sunbeam waits in the car park. Eric, Con and Peter arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it. They go down the gangplank to the floating jetty. A ferry is chugging across the water. \nINT. FERRY - DAY \nCarter sits, watching the other passengers. A mother and two young children take his attention. His look is tinted with regret even remorse. \nEXT. JETTY - DAY \nAs the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up to the rail. The passengers disembark, leaving Carter standing alone.  He's holding Con's handgun. \nEric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters. Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter from under his coat, cocks it and fires. Too late. Carter is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure. Eric shouts. \nERIC No shooters. Cyril said no shooters, you stupid bastard. \nPETER Get stuffed.  He's reloading. \nCON Gerald wants to see him first. \nPETER Shut up. \nCarter is listening to all this. \nCARTER (shouting) Are you coming in? Or do we piss about all day? \nEric laughs. \nERIC You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you. \nCARTER Not till I'm dead, Eric. \nEric laughs. \nERIC Oh, you've still got your sense of humour?  Tell him how I've fixed him, Con. \nCON He's told Gerald about you and Anna. \nERIC Didn't believe us at first, did he, Con? Then Peter talked to him. \nPETER Didn't even say goodbye. Just asked us to take you back - alive. \nERIC He's probably talking to her right now. Are you still going to fancy her when Gerald's finished with her face? \nCarter shows no emotion. Or are his eyes just that bit sadder?  Peter lets rip again. Another window is shattered. Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry. \nCarter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the ferry's superstructure to the roof. By the time he heaves himself into position, Carter is waiting. \nCARTER Stay where you are, Peter. \nPeter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even raise his shooter. \nPETER (screaming) Don't. \nThere's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he cold-bloodedly shoots. Peter is blown away. By the time he hits the deck, he's dead. \nCon and Eric panic. They run up the gangplank, safely out of range. \nERIC Carter, your car needs a wash. \nEric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the Sunbeam into the water. Two hits and the task is done. Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around the sinking car. \nCarter watches impassively. \nCarter enters, surveying the audience. Eventually, his eyes alight on the person he's been looking for Margaret. She's involved with a woman friend and doesn't see him. \nThe next game starts up. \nEXT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT \nCrowds of people come pouring out. It's the end of the evening's entertainment. Margaret walks out with her friend. Carter follows them and turns up a side street. \nEXT. STEPS LEADING TO BACK STREET - NIGHT \nThe place is deserted. Margaret and her friend descend the steps. The clop of their high heels is the only sound. Carter follows discreetly. At the bottom, Margaret and her friend chat for a moment and part. \nCarter follows Margaret. \nEXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT \nThe clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance. She appears. Carter is following behind. He slips into another dark alley to get ahead of her. As she reaches her home Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar. It's holding Con's handgun. \nCARTER I've come for you, Margaret. \nINT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nThere's a big party going on. The music is loud. It's mainly rich-looking middle-aged men and young dolly birds. Different things are obviously going on in different rooms in the house. Dancing in one room, blue movies in another, etc. Kinnear flits from one to another. Eric Paice is on the phone. He puts the receiver down and crosses to Kinnear. \nERIC Gerald Fletcher wants a word with you Cyril. \nKinnear crosses to the telephone. \nKINNEAR Hello, Gerald. \nEXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT \nCarter stands in the dimly lit kiosk with Margaret. The hire car is parked alongside. \nCARTER It's Carter. Listen carefully, you hairy-faced git. I've got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time. All it takes is one call to the police. \nINT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nKinnear listens. \nKINNEAR Really? (pause) So? \nEXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT \nCarter into phone. \nCARTER I'll do a simple deal with you. All I want is ... \nINT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nKinnear is still listening to Carter. He looks over at Eric, who's fixing a drink. \nKINNEAR I see. I think that can be arranged. \nKinnear continues listening. \nINT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT \nCarter into phone. \nCARTER ... but I don't want him there until six in the morning.  OK? (pause) Right. \nCarter hangs up. He pushes Margaret towards the car. \nINT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT \nINT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN \nThe police move through the house and grounds. In the bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, pornography and so on. \nOutside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we see that it's Margaret. \nEXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN \nThe house is surrounded by police measuring and photographing, and outside the house are police cars and ambulances.  The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In the early-morning light, they look like dolls. \nKinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes down the short drive to the gate. \nINT. HIRE CAR - DAWN \nCarter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his left. \nThe sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal loader for tankers. \nThis jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal chutes. \nEXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN \nCarter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. Carter follows. \nAt the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only the harbour waters lapping below. \nCarter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly above him. \nEric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's playing cat and mouse with Eric. \nCARTER (calling out) You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric. \nERIC (wheezing) Sod off. \nPaice darts down another staircase to ground level and makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway. Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the gun up. Eric stops and looks up. \nCARTER Stay away from the car or I'll blow you apart. \nEric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps. He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards the beach. Carter starts after him. \nEXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY \nEric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting. \nIn the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke.  Carter appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and starts running. \nEXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY \nCarter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and panics. He stumbles and falls over. \nHe gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the headland. Carter follows. \nEXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY \nOn the other side of the headland, the scene is extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the left. It's deserted. \nIn the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore. \nEric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. Carter closes on him. \nEXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY \nEric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the mine.  Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and crash as they move along the cable. \nEric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on his heels.  Near the top, where the buckets are practically at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too exhausted to get up. \n", "test1_input": "GET CARTER \nScreenplay by Mike Hodges \nBased on the novel Jack's Return Home by Ted Lewis \nRevised Draft, 1971 \nCopyright (c) 1971 Turner Entertainment Co All Rights Reserved. \nCopyright (c) 1971 Mike Hodges All Rights Reserved. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT \nFramed in the large picture window stands JACK CARTER, alone, looking out at the night. He turns away as the heavy satin curtains close, wiping him from view. \nINT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual orgy. \nGERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA, is curled up beside him. \nSID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control, has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother. \nJack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair. \nClunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand. \nGERALD (removing the cigar from his mouth) Bollock naked with his socks still on? \nSID (thoughtfully) They do that up North. \nGERALD What for? Protective purposes? \nHe laughs. \nSID Ask me? \nGERALD Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground. \nCarter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet. Lights and sweet music happen when he opens it. \nClunk. The slide changes. \nSID Must be a bloody contortionist \nStill looking at the screen, Gerald continues. \nGERALD We don't want you to go up the North, Jack. \nJack and Anna look at each other momentarily. There is definitely something between them. \nJACK No. \nClunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD (groans) Not suede boots! \nSID Knock it off, Gerald. \nGERALD What? And get the clap? \nClunk. The slide changes. \n", "test1_true": "Clunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD What's that? A python. \nSid laughs raucously.  Clunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD What are you going for? \nJACK To find out what happened. \nClunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD Some hard nuts operate up there, Jack. They won't take kindly to someone from London poking his bugle in. \nJACK Too bad. \nGERALD I smell trouble, boy. \nClunk. The slide changes. \nSID The law was satisfied. \nJACK Since when was that good enough? \nClunk. The slide changes. \nGERALD Think again, Jack. \nJACK I will. \nEXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY \nExpress train plunges into a tunnel Blackness. \nBEGIN TITLES: \nINT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY \nThe compartment is full. Jack Carter sits in one corner, reading a Raymond Chandler paperback, Farewell My Lovely. \nEXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY \nThe train speeds northwards. In the distance the stacks of a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown smoke. \nINT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - DAY \nCarter steadies himself as he comes along the corridor. \nEXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY \nA massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past. Its mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect. \nINT. TRAIN TOILET - DAY \nCarter tips his head back and dispenses drops into his nose. \nEXT. RAIL TRACK - EVENING \nThe train breaks from another tunnel. Evening light cuts across the track as the train hurtles on. \nINT. TRAIN RESTAURANT CAR - EVENING \nCarter pours himself a glass of water and takes out a small phial of brown pills. He swallows one. \nEXT. RAIL TRACK - NIGHT \n", "test2_input": "CARTER You bitch! It was you who told them I was here, wasn't it? \nHe smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out. The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans out, his usual cheery self. \nCON Peter's very upset about his car. He's going to shit all over you. \nCARTER I'll catch up with you later, Margaret. \nAnd with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated roof. Con jumps out of the Jaguar. \nPETER (shouts above the revs) Come on, get in. \nCon does and they race off. \nEXT. WASTELAND - DAY \nCarter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown steps leading down to the river road, where his car is parked. He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off. \nEXT. RIVER ROAD - DAY \nCarter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind. He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see his parked car. \nAs he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car. \nA Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him just before the Jaguar and slows down. \nGLENDA Over here, Jack. \nCarter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down, so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off. \nThe Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre. \nGlenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at the top of the hill. \nINT. SUNBEAM - DAY \nEvery movement Glenda makes is sexually charged manual gear changes, steering, even braking. Carter can't take his eyes off her. \nGLENDA You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you? \nCARTER No. I didn't know that. \nGLENDA A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky? \nCARTER So where are we going, Princess? \nGLENDA To the demon king's castle, of course. \nCARTER Of course. Where else? \nThe car screams off the road into a multi-storey carpark. \nINT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY \nGlenda really puts her foot down. The car hurtles around each deserted floor. \nCARTER How'd you know where I'd be? \nGLENDA You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited. \nCARTER Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk! \nGLENDA Nasty. \nCARTER He must have been pretty sure I'd come. \n", "test2_true": "CARTER (smiling) And what was that? \nGLENDA We're there now. \nShe brakes to a split-second stop. \nINT. PENTHOUSE RESTAURANT - DAY \nIt's one large empty concrete box with big picture windows all the way round. Wires are hanging from the ceiling and walls where the lights will eventually be fixed. \nA tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting sun. He is just a silhouette. \nCarter and Glenda enter and walk towards the man. The silhouette turns as he nears it. It's Brumby. \nBRUMBY A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant. (pause) Do you like it? \nCARTER Yes. \nBRUMBY Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming, (pause) It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother? (pause) I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back, (pause) You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother, (pause) One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs. (pause) So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit, (pause) So I'm worried. I can't fight them \u0097 I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead. \nBrumby picks up a black briefcase. He holds it up to Carter. \nBRUMBY Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you. \nCARTER What name? \nBRUMBY Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. (pause) Kinnear did it. \nCARTER Why? \nBRUMBY I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead. \nCARTER Why? \nBRUMBY I don't know. That's all I was told. \nCarter takes a last look at Glenda and walks slowly back towards the entrance. \nCARTER That's not good enough. \nBRUMBY Christ, what... \nCARTER (shouting) Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so? (pause) Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on. \nBRUMBY Jack, you're wrong. \nCARTER Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits. \nBRUMBY Jack... \nEXT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY \nCarter steps out of the elevator as Glenda's Sunbeam comes down the bottom ramp fast. The car brakes hard and stops. Carter opens the door and gets in. Not a word is said. \nINT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe apartment is one of many in a modern block and Glenda has only recently moved in. There is a mattress on the floor. A large mirror leans against the wall behind it and a film projector stands close to the window, which has makeshift curtains. \nCarter and Glenda are on the mattress. The bedding is all over the place. They have just finished fucking. \nCARTER (looking around) Who's setting you up in this place? \nGLENDA Brumby. \nCARTER Is he coming here? \n", "test3_input": "INT. CAFE - DAY \nA girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea. The door slams open. There's Carter. \nCARTER Where's Albert? \nThe girl is numb with fear, unable to answer. Carter grabs her by the throat. \nCARTER Where's Albert? \nThe girl is frozen with terror. He lets go as suddenly as he grabbed her. \nCARTER I know where I'll find him. \nEXT. BACK STREET - DAY \nCarter walks fast. There's the sound of a phone being dialled. It's the GIRL in the cafe. \nGIRL (V.O.) Eric, he's come for Albert, (pause) I don't know, (pause) On the ferry, I reckon. \nCarter reaches the front of a betting shop. He walks in. \nINT. BETTING SHOP - DAY \nCarter closes the door. Race results and odds are coming over the Tannoy. He moves into the shop until he reaches ALBERT SWIFT. Albert is making out a betting slip and doesn't see him. \nCARTER Hello, Albert. \nAlbert looks like he's going to be sick. \nALBERT Hello, Jack, (snivelling) I don't know anything, Jack. \nCARTER Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you. \nALBERT I know. I know. \nCarter sees a door at the back. There's a sign for the toilets. \nCARTER Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert? \nAt first Albert doesn't understand. \nCARTER Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert? \nThis time it clicks. Albert moves to the door and Carter follows. \nEXT. BETTING SHOP BACKYARD - DAY \nCarter turns to close the door. Albert runs for it. He reaches the high double-gate at the end. It's locked and he tries to climb it. No luck. Carter easily pulls him down. Albert faces him. \nCARTER You can't get away from me, Albert. \nALBERT I know. \nHe feels for his cigarettes but can't find them. \nALBERT For Christ's sake, give us a fag. \nCarter takes out his cigarettes. Albert takes one. \nALBERT I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird. \nCARTER Did Eric Pake pull her? \nALBERT Yes. \n", "test3_true": "ALBERT I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret. \nCARTER When did you find out? \nALBERT A couple of weeks back. \nCARTER How? \nALBERT No choice. I had a visit from somebody. \nCARTER Who? \nALBERT Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen. \nCARTER And you told Brumby? \nAlbert nods. \nCARTER Who killed Frank? \nAlbert doesn 't answer. \nCARTER Do you want to be dead, Albert? \nALBERT Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat. (pause) I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest. \nCARTER What did you do?  Albert? \nALBERT Nothing. What could I do? \nCARTER Did Eric know that Frank was my brother? \nALBERT Yes. I told him. \nCARTER What did he say? \nALBERT 'Good.' \nAlbert draws deeply on his cigarette. \nThey drove Frank away in a car. \nCARTER Is that all there is? \nAlbert nods. \nCARTER Then that's it, Albert. \nCarter takes something from his pocket. There's a loud click.  It's a. knife. \nALBERT Jack, for Christ's sake ... \nHe falls to his knees. \nCARTER You knew what I'd do. \nALBERT (crying) Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him. \nCarter drives the knife into him with all his might. \nCARTER I know you didn't kill him. (and again.) I know you didn't. \nA ship's horn calls mournfully from the harbour. Albert leans back. Blood seeps from his chest. He pitches forward, twitches, and is dead. \nINT. BETTING SHOP - DAY \n"}

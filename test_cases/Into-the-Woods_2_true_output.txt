The BABY begins to whimper. The BAKER walks towards CINDERELLA and his SON. 
BAKER Here -- give him to me. The BAKER walks away from the group, trying to settle his SON. He wraps his SCARF around the BABY. 
BAKER (CONT'D) (to the BABY) Hey, hey, hey, come on now. Hey, please, come on, come on, it's okay. I know you miss your mother. The BAKER sits on a fallen tree trunk. 
BAKER (CONT'D) I miss her too. The BABY cries. 
BAKER (CONT'D) Sssh! The BABY still cries. 
BAKER (CONT'D) 
MAYBE I JUST WASN'T MEANT TO HAVE 
CHILDREN-- The BAKER hears his WIFE'S voice. We see her over his shoulder. 
WIFE 
DON'T SAY THAT!/ OF COURSE YOU WERE 
MEANT TO HAVE CHILDREN. 
BAKER 
BUT HOW CAN I GO ABOUT BEING A FATHER/ 
WHEN I HAD NO FATHER TO SHOW ME? 
WIFE 
JUST CALM THE CHILD. 
BAKER 
YES, CALM THE CHILD. 
WIFE 
LOOK, TELL HIM THE STORY/ OF HOW IT 
ALL HAPPENED./ BE FATHER AND MOTHER,/ 
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO. 
BAKER 
ALONE... 
WIFE 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE LEAVE YOU/ HALFWAY 
THROUGH THE WOOD./ DO NOT LET IT 
GRIEVE YOU,/ NO ONE LEAVES FOR GOOD./ 
YOU ARE NOT ALONE./ NO ONE IS ALONE. 
HOLD HIM TO THE LIGHT NOW./ LET HIM 
SEE THE GLOW./ THINGS WILL BE ALL 
RIGHT NOW./ TELL HIM WHAT YOU KNOW... 
BAKER Shhhh. As the Baker holds his son close, the baby begins to calm down for the first time in his father's arms and his WIFE disappears. The BAKER tells the story to his son -- THE SAME STORY AS WE 
HEARD AT THE BEGINNING. 
BAKER (CONT'D) WITCH (V.O.) Once upon a time...in a far CAREFUL THE THINGS YOU SAY,/ off kingdom...there lay a CHILDREN WILL LISTEN./ small village at the edge of CAREFUL THE THINGS YOU DO,/ the woods... And in this CHILDREN WILL SEE./ AND village lived a young LEARN. maiden...a carefree young lad...and a childless baker...with his wife. 
LRRH, JACK, and CINDERELLA join the BAKER. 
WITCH (V.O.) 
BAKER 
GUIDE THEM ALONG THE WAY,/ And one day, the baker and 
CHILDREN WILL GLISTEN./ his wife were in their shop 
CHILDREN WILL LOOK TO YOU/ when a witch burst in, 
FOR WHICH WAY TO TURN,/ TO blowing the door off its 
LEARN WHAT TO BE. hinges... 
WITCH (V.O.) 
CAREFUL BEFORE YOU SAY,/ "LISTEN TO 
ME."/ CHILDREN WILL LISTEN. The light of the new dawn streams down on them, framing the newly formed family. As the BAKER continues to tell the story the CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS UP overhead to reveal the vast woods, now changed by the Giant's path. The CAMERA then carries us back beyond the woods and to the Village where we see the destruction that has visited it. 
WITCH & ALL (V.O.) 
CAREFUL THE WISH YOU MAKE,/ WISHES ARE 
CHILDREN./ CAREFUL THE PATH THEY TAKE-- 
/ WISHES COME TRUE,/ NOT FREE. 
CAREFUL THE SPELL YOU CAST,/ NOT JUST 
ON CHILDREN./ SOMETIMES THE SPELL MAY 
LAST/ PAST WHAT YOU CAN SEE/ AND TURN 
AGAINST YOU... 
The CAMERA finally pans up from the Village to the sky and we are returned to where we began: the grey clouds of an early morning sky. 
WITCH (V.O.) 
CAREFUL THE TALE YOU TELL./ THAT IS 
THE SPELL./ CHILDREN WILL LISTEN... 
FADE TO BLACK

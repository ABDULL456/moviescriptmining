DOYLE You still dealin' shit? 
KID Jesus, no, Doyle.  I'm clean.  I'm working twelve hours a day here. 
Close shot of DOYLE talking around a mouthful of doughnut. 
DOYLE When they going to make you chairman of the board? 
Medium close shot of DOYLE and the KID.  DOYLE puts down the coffee cup.  Waves the KID closer.  The KID moves closer, DOYLE frisks him quickly, expertly, then rips up the kid's jacket and takes a 12-inch toadsticker out of the kid's waistband. 
Close shot of DOYLE looking at the knife, snapping the button and watching the blade flash out. 
DOYLE You clean your fingernails with this. 
Close shot of KID. 
KID Rather be caught with it than without it. 
DOYLE, pushing button and letting the blade fall into closed position. 
DOYLE Yeah, I guess so. 
DOYLE hands the knife back to the kid.  HECTOR goes back to work.  DOYLE eats. 
EXT. DAN'S LUNCH - DAY 
DOYLE climbing back into his car, knees on the seat, reaching over into the back. 
Close shot over the rear seat of DOYLE picking up the straw hat, which has been jammed into the corner by the contours of the Hooker's tail.  He straightens it as much as possible and throws it under the driver's seat. 
EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY 
Medium shot of DOYLE on foot popeyeing up Madison Avenue in the vicinity of the Westbury.  As unobtrusively as possible, he's looking for the tail that should be there covering CHARNIER.  DOYLE is on the East side of the street, and the Westbury is on the West.  He pokes his head into a couple of doorways, checks the cars parked at the curb, looks up to a couple of the mezzanine shops along the street.  He sees PHIL KLEIN and ANOTHER AGENT talking together totally oblivious to the front entrance.  MULDERIG in a cigar store looks to his wristwatch, then goes inside the store. 
Close shot of DOYLE frowning, puzzled.  There doesn't seem to be anybody alert.  He looks over to the hotel. 
Westbury Hotel entrance from DOYLE's Point of View.  CHARNIER steps out of hotel entrance, turns south.  The two AGENTS and MULDERIG have not seen his exit. 
Close on DOYLE in a doorway. 
CHARNIER, carrying an umbrella, strolling blithely down the street, in DOYLE's direction but on the opposite side of the street.  Zoom in on his face, reflecting no concern, no problems, then zoom back to DOYLE's position.  Pan to the hotel entrance as DOYLE looks for somebody else.  Where the hell is CHARNIER's surveillance? 
Very quickly, DOYLE's nervous glances. 
CHARNIER close. 
A long view of the street. 
CHARNIER moving along. 
The hotel entrance. 
Close shot of DOYLE going through the glancing movements, his eyes showing CHARNIER getting farther and farther down Madison Avenue.  But there's still nobody following him. 
Medium close shot of DOYLE scrambling out of the doorway and moving down the street after CHARNIER. 
Rear view of CHARNIER stopping at a newsstand, buying a copy of the Times. 
DOYLE in a doorway, peering out and down the street. 
Medium close front view of CHARNIER strolling along, glancing at the headlines of the Times, an umbrella hooked over his left forearm as he walks. 
Close shot of CHARNIER's polished shoes, moving quickly down subway entrance stairs.  Hold on the empty stairs.  Then DOYLE's painful, scuffed shoes, follow. 
EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY 
Close shot CHARNIER standing on the subway platform, looking at the Times, glancing toward the tracks and the rumble of a train in the distance.

WALLY (to Homer) I never said they were boring. 
CANDY You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying." 
WALLY Well, they aren't. 
Homer looks back at Candy. Her eyes close. 
HOMER I think I'd probably like the apple business. 
WALLY You're a little overqualified, aren't you? 
HOMER No, I'm not. I need a job. 
WALLY The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring. 
Candy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little. 
CANDY There! You said it was boring. 
WALLY Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking! 
Candy seems irritated with Wally. Homer tries to engage her. 
HOMER Is your family in the apple business, too? 
CANDY No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman. 
HOMER I've never seen a lobster. 
CANDY Really? 
HOMER I've never seen the ocean, either. 
WALLY (amazed) You've never seen the *ocean*? 
Homer shakes his head, smiles. 
WALLY That's not funny... that's *serious*. 
EXT./INT. ROADSIDE/CAR - NIGHT 
The car is parked at the side of the road. Wally is half- hidden behind a tree. Candy and Homer are left alone in the car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to hear Wally's excessive peeing. Suddenly Candy starts to sob. 
CANDY I couldn't have a baby with someone who's leaving me--I didn't know what else to do! 
Homer is a doctor--he's used to postabortion reactions. 
HOMER I know. 
CANDY He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him! 
HOMER Where's Mandalay? 
CANDY Burma! 
HOMER Oh... 
CANDY I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back! 
HOMER I understand. 
He doesn't, really. Wally returns. Wally leans over Candy to hug her. 
WALLY Honey, honey... of course I'll come back. 
Candy pounds on his chest with her fists. 
CANDY You don't *know*, Wally. You have no *idea*! 
Wally backs away. Candy sobs uncontrollably. 
CANDY Stay away from me! 
Wally signals to Homer to get out of the car. 
Later, Wally and Homer stand outside the car, overhearing Candy's weeping. Homer is smoking nervously. 
HOMER (strictly medical) This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time. 
WALLY I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*! 
HOMER It's all very normal. 
Wally looks at Homer, who takes a nervous drag on his cigarette. 
WALLY You ought to cut that shit out--it's terrible for you. 
Homer looks at Wally; he sees the authority in his eyes. Homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot. 
They notice that Candy has stopped crying. Wally finds Candy asleep in the backseat.

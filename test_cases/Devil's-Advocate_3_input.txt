DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96 
FADE IN: 
1   INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY                                  1 
Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an efficient man with a good case. 
The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been carefully rehearsed. 
BARBARA ... we go back to our homeroom for dismissal, unless you have a pass for sports or something. 
PROSECUTOR (O.S.) And is that what you did on the day in question? 
BARBARA No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay after class. 
PROSECUTOR What happened next, Barbara? 
BARBARA Mr. Gettys closed the door. 
PROSECUTOR Everyone else had gone? 
BARBARA Yes. He told me to sit in the chair beside his desk. 
MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly enduring this testimony.

PROSECUTOR In your own words, Barbara, can you tell us exactly what happened during the next few minutes? 
KEVIN LOMAX.    Defense counsel.   Taking it all in. 
BARBARA (O.S.) I told him I was afraid I would miss my bus. He promised I would get to the bus on time if I would help him to do something... 
Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom -- taking inventory -- assessing damage -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... Then he put -- before I could say anything -- he placed his hand inside my blouse... 
Kevin -- checking the jury and -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... I was so frightened I didn't move. I thought if I was just quiet it would be okay... 
Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops him cold -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... Then his other hand went up under -- inside my skirt... 
Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly feeling their way along the leg of his chair -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... his hand then, it started, he started, moving back and forth -- farther and farther inside my skirt... 
Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... he said he was testing to see if I had any special feelings, that he wanted to find out what kind of feelings I had...

1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               1 
Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg -- absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... I didn't know what to say, I was trying to think of something to say but I was confused and he just kept on -- with his hand -- moving it -- under my dress -- higher and higher... 
Kevin is rocked.    Trying not to show it. 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... then I, I was asking him to stop but it was like he couldn't hear me -- he just kept on -- 
Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) -- and then I screamed... 
Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him. Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and -- 
BARBARA ... then he, he got mad and said we would have to try again sometime. 
PROSECUTOR And did he try again? 
BARBARA Not with me. 
PROSECUTOR With friends of yours? 
BARBARA Yes. 
PROSECUTOR And when you told them what he had done to you, they told you what he had done to them, isn't that true? 
BARBARA Yes. 
PROSECUTOR I have nothing further.

KEVIN Any chance, Your Honor, for a short recess?

{"train": "THE DARK KNIGHT RISES \nWritten by \nJonathan Nolan & Christopher Nolan \nStory by \nChristopher Nolan & David S. Goyer \nBLACK SCREEN. \nGORDON (V.O) Harvey Dent was needed. He was everything Gotham has been crying out for. He was...a hero. Not the hero we deserved - the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight, shining... \nThe sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice. The shape of a BAT. The ice disintegrates... \nEXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY \nGordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent. \nGORDON But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his eulogy. I believed in Harvey Dent. And we FADE TO BLACK. \nCUT TO: \nRacing along a cratered dirt road, and we are - \nINT. LAND CRUISER JOSTLING OVER UNEVEN TERRAIN - DAY \nThree Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man. \nEXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY \nAn airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men, stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the vehicle. The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA Man. \nCIA MAN Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA. Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a briefcase. \nDRIVER He wasn't alone. CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr. Pavel. \nCIA MAN You don't get to bring friends. \nDR. PAVEL \n(SHAKEN) They are not my friends. \nDRIVER Don't worry, no charge for them. \nCIA MAN Why would I want them? \nDRIVER They were trying to grab your prize. (Smiles.) They work for the mercenary. The masked man. \nCIA MAN \n(EXCITED) Bane? The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men. \nCIA MAN Get 'em on board - I'll call it in. \nEXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY \nThe commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains. \nINT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS \nThe three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed. CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1. \nCIA MAN What are you doing in the middle of my operation? \nHooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun. The flight plan I just filed with the Agency lists me, my men, and Dr. Pavel here. But only one of you. CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man 1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind. \nCIA MAN \nFIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.) \nSO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR. \nPAVEL?! \nNothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet. \nCIA MAN \nHE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO \nTRY NEXT?! \nThe Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door. \nCIA MAN \nTELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE \nWEAR THE MASK?! \nThe prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing. \nCIA MAN \nLOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN! \nTHIRD PRISONER (O.S.) Or he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane. \nCIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door. \nCIA MAN Wiseguy, huh? At least you can talk. Who are you? \nTHIRD PRISONER We are nothing. We are the dirt beneath your feet. And no one cared who I was until I put on the mask... \nCIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane. \nBANE Who we are does not matter. What matters is our plan. \nBLAKE The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes out two SWAT teams, breaks Dent's neck...then just vanishes? \nGORDON I'm not hearing a question, son. \nBlake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon. \nBLAKE Don't you want to know who we was? Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes his fingers across its rusted shell. \nGORDON I know exactly who he was. (Turns to Blake.) He was Batman. \nGordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs. \nGORDON (O.S.) Let's go see about the Congressman's wife... \nINT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING \nAlfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty. \nALFRED Master Wayne? Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply. \nINT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER \nAlfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS \nAlfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor. \nINT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS \nAlfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube. \nALFRED You haven't been down here in a long time... \nWAYNE Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints from the photos she handled - Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery suspect. - but she was wearing someone else's fingerprints. She's good. \nALFRED She may be. But we have the trace on the necklace. \nWAYNE We do, so I cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end B-and-E's... \nWayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears. Selina Kyle. The databases are full of close calls, tips from fences... \nNewspaper headlines appear - \nTHE CAT STRIKES AGAIN, POLICE SUSPECT 'CAT' BURGLAR IN JEWEL \nHEIST. \nWAYNE She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet. \nALFRED We should send the police before she fences the pearls. \nWAYNE She won't. She likes them too much. And they weren't what she was after. \nALFRED What was she after? \nWAYNE My fingerprints. There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. Gives you a good pull, and it's untraceable. \nALFRED Fascinating. Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee. \nWAYNE Now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief? \nALFRED At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the world. \nWAYNE There's nothing out there for me. \nALFRED And that's the problem. You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. You won't get out there and find a life. Find someone - \nWAYNE \n(BITTER) I did find someone, Alfred. \nALFRED I know. And then you lost them. That's part of living, sir. But you're not living - you're waiting. Hoping for things to go bad again. \nWayne says nothing. Remember when you left Gotham? Before all this. Before Batman. Seven years you were gone. Seven years I waited. Hoping that you wouldn't come back. Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding. Every year I took my holiday. I'd go to Florence. There's a caf\u00e9 by the Arno... Any fine evening I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca... INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a caf\u00e9 sipping his drink... I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine that one day I'd look across the tables, and see you. Sitting there with your wife. Perhaps some kids. You wouldn't say anything to me, or me to you, but we'd both know...that you'd made it. That you were happy. \nINSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks closer, hopeful. But they are strangers. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I knew there was nothing there for you but pain and tragedy, and I wanted more for you than that. I still do. Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats. \nEXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - DAY \nBlake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough. \nDWP MAN They wash up a couple times a month. More when in gets colder - homeless sheltering in the tunnels. We had to pull him to clear the basin, but other than that we didn't touch him... \nThey come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies a body - a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes. \nROSS What? \nBLAKE Name's Jimmy. He's at St. Swithin's. (Off look.) The boys home where I...I coach some ball. \nEXT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - DAY \nBlake looks up at the shabby building. \nINT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - MOMENTS LATER \nBlake is talking to Father Reilly. \nFATHER REILLY Jimmy hadn't been here for months. \nBLAKE Why? \nFATHER REILLY You know why, Blake - he aged out. We don't have the resources to keep boys on after sixteen - \nBLAKE The Wayne Foundation gives money for that - \nFATHER REILLY Not for two years now. \nBLAKE He has a brother here, right? \nINT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS \nBlake enters, gun drawn. Spots the Congressman. \nBLAKE \n(INTO RADIO) I've got the Congressman - bullet to the leg, but he's okay. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then race around a corner into a smaller passage. A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon jumps out, gun drawn. \nThe SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals, counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high. The passage is empty. \nThe SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once - \nGORDON Manhole! \nHe races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover, Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT. \nGORDON You three, down with me. You two, head down to cover the next exit - \nSWAT Where -? \nGORDON Get the DWP down here, now! \nGordon starts climbing down the ladder... \nINT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS \nGordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low. Three SWATs fall in behind... \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS \nBlake comes into the alley. Cops surround the manhole. \nCOP Where's the DWP guy? \nBLAKE They went down there? \nFOLEY (shaking his head) And Gordon took SWAT in after them. \nINT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS \nGordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward, tearing through the tunnels. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS \nBlake jumps back as a fireball bursts out of the manhole. \nINT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS \nGordon races around a corner, gun drawn. A noise makes him turn - WHACK, he is clobbered from behind by a Thug. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS \nBlake pushes forward. \nBLAKE Come on, we gotta get down there - \nCOP That was a gas explosion, kid - \nBLAKE Gas? This is a sewer! \nFOLEY No one goes in there till we know what's down there. \nBLAKE We know what's down there, sir. The Police Commissioner! \nFOLEY Somebody get the hothead out of here. And get me a DWP guy! Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car. \nINT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS \nThug 1 flips Gordon onto his back. \nTHUG 1 This one's alive. (Looks closer.) Jesus. It's the Police Commissioner. \nTHUG 2 What do we do? \nTHUG 1 Take him to Bane. The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels. As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon between two waterfalls, into - \nINT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) \nThey approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine... \nBANE Why are you here? The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet. \nTHUG 1 Answer him! Bane slowly turns to the Thugs. \nBANE I'm asking you. \nTHUG 1 It's the Police Commissioner. \nBANE And you brought him down here? \nTHUG 2 We didn't know what to do. We - \nBANE You panicked. And your weakness costs three lives. \nTHUG 1 No, he's alone - Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack. Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2. \nBANE Search him. Then I will kill you. The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet, gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read. Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at the papers. Unfolds them... \nAs he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out... \nTHUG 2 He's dead. \nThug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers... \nBANE Then show me his body. \nMIRANDA He doesn't talk to you either? \nFOX Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has his...eccentricities. \nMIRANDA \n(RISING) Mr. Fox, are you aware that John Daggett is trying to acquire shares in Wayne Enterprises? \nFOX I was not. But it wouldn't do him any good - Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority. Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops. \nFOX Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe. Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane. \nFOX What brings you out of cryo-sleep Mr. Wayne? \nWAYNE I see you haven't lost your sense of humor...even if you have lost most of my money. \nFOX Actually, you did that yourself. See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive. \nWAYNE Even with - \nFOX A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes. Wayne Enterprises is running out of time. And Daggett is moving in. \nWAYNE What're my options? \nFOX If you're not willing to turn your machine on - \nWAYNE I can't, Lucius. \nFOX Then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at arm's length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she's supported your project all the way. She's smart, and quite lovely. \nWAYNE You too, Lucius? \nFOX We all just want what's best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine. \nWAYNE I'll think it over. \nFOX Anything else? \nWAYNE No, why? \nFOX These conversations always used to end with some...unusual requests. \nWAYNE I retired. \nFOX Let me show you some stuff, anyway. Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden elevator. \nINT. APPLIED SCIENCES - MOMENTS LATER \nFox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations... \nWAYNE I figured you'd have shut this place down. \nFOX It was always shut down, officially. \nWAYNE But all this new stuff? \nFOX After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. I've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. My roof. \nWAYNE Why? \nFOX Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them... Wayne shakes his head. \nFOX Sure I can't tempt you to something? Pneumatic crampons? Infrared lenses? Least let me get you something for that leg. \nWAYNE It's fine the use it gets these days. \nFOX Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk... Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes light up. \nWAYNE Now you're just showing off. \nFOX Defense Department project for tight-geometry urban pacification. Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation. \nWAYNE What's it called? \nFOX It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. So I took to calling it the Bat. And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black. Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling. \nFOX Works great except for the autopilot. \nWAYNE What's wrong with that? \nFOX Software-based instability. Take a better mind than mine to fix it. \nWAYNE Better mind? \nFOX I was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours, perhaps. Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away. \nWAYNE I told you. I retired, Lucius. \nINT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nWayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray. \nDOCTOR I've seen worse cartilage in knees \nWAYNE That's good - \nDOCTOR No, that's because there is no cartilage in your knee. And not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders. Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys, residual concussive damage to your brain tissue and general scarred-over quality of your body... (Takes a deep breath.) I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing. About the only part of your body that looks healthy is your liver, so if you're bored I recommend you take up drinking, Mr. Wayne. Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask, steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane, which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as - \nEXT. TENTH FLOOR, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS \nWayne drops three floors... \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS \nGordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries to speak with a weak, hoarse voice... \nGORDON We were in this together. Then you were gone... \nWAYNE The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won. \nWAYNE Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means either you're saving for your retirement - or you're in deep with the wrong people. \nSELINA You don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor. \nWAYNE Actually, I was born in the Regency Room. \nSELINA I started off doing what I had to. Once you've done what you had to they'll never let you do what you want to. \nWAYNE Start fresh. \nSELINA There's no fresh start in today's world. Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks. We are the sum of our mistakes. \nWAYNE Or our achievements. \nSELINA The mistakes stick better. Trust me. \nWAYNE You think that justifies stealing? \nSELINA I take what I need to from those who have more than enough. I don't stand on the shoulders of people with less. \nWAYNE Robin Hood? \nSELINA I'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you. \nWAYNE Maybe you're assuming too much. \nSELINA Or maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet. \nWAYNE Ouch. \nSELINA You think all this can last? Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party. \nSELINA There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us. \nWAYNE Sounds like you're looking forward to it. \nSELINA I'm adaptable. \nWAYNE These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe... \nWayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back of her neck, unclasps the necklace. But I still can't let you keep them. \nThe pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears. \nRICH TWIT \n(ANNOYED) You scared her off. \nWAYNE Not likely. \nEXT. MUSEUM - MOMENTS LATER \nWayne approaches the Valet. Pats down his pockets. \nWAYNE I must have lost my ticket - \nVALET Your wife said you were taking a cab home, sir. \nWAYNE My wife? \nINT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI RACING DOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nSelina permits herself a little smile as she guns the engine. \nINT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER \nAlfred watches in the mirror as Wayne climbs into the back. \nALFRED Just you, sir? \nWayne gives him a withering glare. \n(MORE) \nALFRED (CONT'D) Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a little time to get back into the swing of things. Wayne dials his phone. \nFOX (O.S.) This is Fox. \nWAYNE Remember those 'unusual requests' I used to make? \nFOX (O.S.) I knew it! Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned. \nINT. BATCAVE - DAY \nWayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a Thermos. \nALFRED You've got the wrong leg, sir. \nWAYNE You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns. Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious. Now we tighten it up. \nWayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth. \nALFRED It is terribly painful? \nWAYNE \n(GRITTED TEETH) You're welcome to try it, Alfred. \nALFRED Happy watching, thank you, sir. Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet. \nWAYNE Not bad - Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick. Not bad at all. \nAlfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows Wayne across the bridge to the cube. \nALFRED Master Wayne, if you're considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane. \nWAYNE I'm all ears. \nALFRED There is a prison. In a more ancient part of the world. A pit. Where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes...the pit sends something back. \nBANE For now. How much longer does the program need? \nSHOESHINE MAN Eight minutes. \nBANE Time to go mobile. Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack... \nEXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS \nAllen shouts at his men. \nALLEN Get the barriers up - no more in and out on this street! Steel wedge-shaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the street. A Sniper watches the doors through a thermal scope. Six large heat signatures bloom, too big for people... \nSNIPER I've got something - The door explodes. SWATs duck, six sportbikes race out and leap the ramp-like barricades, sending SWATs scattering. Cops scramble to pull their vehicles out to give chase. \nEXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS \nThe bikes weave through traffic, Traders strapped to the back, facing backwards - screaming, ties flying in the wind. A cruiser falls in behind. \nROOKIE COP Shoot the tires! \nA Veteran Cop sights a shot, but the Traders are in the way. \nVETERAN COP No shot! \nEXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS \nFoley is barking into his radio. \nFOLEY Back off, back off! They've got hostages! \nINT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nThe cruiser follows the bike into a large tunnel. A Rookie Cop looks up into his rear-view. \nROOKIE COP What's going on with the lights? The Veteran Cop looks back - streetlights and headlights are dying one after another. The darkness is chasing them - the darkness hits them. Their lights, sirens, and engine die... \nAnd, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past - \nVETERAN COP It can't be... \nROOKIE COP The hell was that?! \nVETERAN COP Oh boy. You're in for a show tonight, son. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS \nFood Guy drives the rear bike. He looks back - sees streetlights explode behind him - darkness catching him up. \nThe engine chokes and dies. The Trader jumps off, shouting for the cops. Food Guy turns, pulling his gun. SMASH! - Food Guy is thrown backwards off his bike by a dark wing as BATMAN races by on the Bat-Pod. \nEXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS \nFoley rushes to Blake's cruiser. \nFOLEY Let's roll, they've spotted the Batman! \nEXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS \nThe remaining bikes split up as they reach a high overpass. \nEXT. HIGH OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS \nBatman pulls up, overlooking the intersection - pulls a rifle-shaped device. A tone builds - he aims it at the bike and fires. \nEXT. HIGHWAY OFF-RAMP - CONTINUOUS \nJanitor's bike sparks and dies. Sirens as Cops move in, Another bike splutters and dies - the Hostage breaks for cover. \nEXT. HIGH OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS \nBatman sees the last two bikes disappear beneath an overpass. He holsters his EMP rifle and guns the Bat-Pod. \nINT. BLAKE'S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS \nFoley, in the back, is using the cruiser as a mobile command station. \nFOLEY \n(INTO RADIO) Call everyone in - every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty, too! Pull 'em in, close every street! Now! Foley looks out at Gotham rushing by. \nFOLEY I'm gonna do what Gordon never could. \nBLAKE What's that? \nFOLEY I'm gonna take down the Batman. \nBLAKE Sir, what about the armed robbers? \nFoley ignores him. \nEXT. GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS \nAll around the city, cops mobilize - cars, vans, choppers... \nEXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS \nBane pulls up at speed alongside Shoeshine Man. Shoeshine Man glances inside his pack - signals '2'. Bane turns, sees darkness approaching, reaches back and grabs his Hostage, lifting him onto the back of Shoeshine Man's bike. Bane peels off - Batman stays on Shoeshine Man. \nINT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS \nA Spotter watches Bane peel off, hits the radio. \nSPOTTER \n(INTO RADIO) One bike's pulled off, no hostage - \nINT. BLAKE'S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS \nFoley listens to the radio, hungry - \nDaggett watches the TV coverage, concerned. Stryver enters. \nSTRYVER Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished. \nDAGGETT What about the men they arrested? \nSTRYVER He says, and I quote, they would die before talking. \nDAGGETT \n(GRINS) Where does he find these guys? Daggett gets to his feet, relieved, moves to his inner office. Open the champagne... \nINT. INNER OFFICE, DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nDaggett comes through the door, calling back. \nDAGGETT And can we get some girls in here? \nCATWOMAN (O.S.) Careful what you wish for. Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back slams against the wall - he draws a gun, but - WHACK! - Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in. \nCATWOMAN Cat got your tongue? She plucks the gun from his trembling hand. \nDAGGETT You dumb bitch. \nCATWOMAN Nobody ever accused me of being dumb. \nDAGGETT Dumb to show up here tonight. \nCATWOMAN I want what you owe me - \nClick - Stryver has a gun to her head. \nDAGGETT 'I want' never gets... \nStryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her leg... \nSTRYVER Nice outfit...those heels make it tough to walk? \nCatwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams. \nCATWOMAN I don't know, do they? \nCatwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett. \nCATWOMAN So where is it? \nDAGGETT Where's what? \nCATWOMAN The program. The 'Clean Slate'. \nDAGGETT Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record. I don't have it. The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the window. He screams - they drop... \nEXT. WINDOW-CLEANING PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS \n...ten feet onto the window-cleaning platform. Catwoman uses her bladed heel to cut a rope - the platform plunges down the side of the building. \nEXT. FLAT ROOF - MOMENTS LATER \nCatwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him. \nCATWOMAN Where is it? \nDAGGETT The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database? Little too good to be true. \nCATWOMAN You're lying. Rykin Data took it to prototype stage - \nDAGGETT That's why I bought them. But they had nothing. It was a gangland myth. \nCatwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds Daggett by the throat, threatening him. \nCATWOMAN Stay back! They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer onto his gun. \nCATWOMAN I'm not bluffing! \nVOICE (O.S.) They know... \nAll eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman. \nBATMAN They just don't care. \nAs the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick. \nCATWOMAN You've got to be kidding. \nBATMAN No guns. No killing. \nCATWOMAN Where's the fun in that? As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for the far edge. \nBATMAN Come on! Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof. She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley - sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open. Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy hisses shut, taking bullets from above. \nCATWOMAN My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men - \nBATMAN This isn't a car. Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky, downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night. \nEXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out. \nCATWOMAN See you around - Batman steps down after her. \nBATMAN You're welcome. \nCATWOMAN I had it under control. \nBATMAN Those weren't street thugs - they were trained killers. I saved your life. In return I need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints. Catwoman looks at him. Considering. \nCATWOMAN Wayne wasn't kidding about a 'powerful friend'. I sold his prints to Daggett. For something that doesn't even exist. \nBATMAN I doubt many people get the better of you. \nWAYNE Sorry?! You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?! \nALFRED No. I know what this means - \nWAYNE What does it mean, Alfred?! \nALFRED It means your hatred. It means losing the person I've cared for ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important. \nWayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to say and says it quietly and calmly. \nWAYNE Goodbye, Alfred. \nALFRED \n(QUIET) Goodbye, Bruce. Wayne mounts the stairs...Alfred watches him go. Turns. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING \nWayne is woken by the doorbell. \nINT. STAIRCASE, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER \nAs Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing gown, he can't resist one tentative. \nWAYNE Alfred? But Alfred is gone. \nINT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nWayne opens the front door the find Fox. Fox is surprised. \nFOX Answering your own door? \nWAYNE Yes. Could you decode the trades on that drive? \nFox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline: \nBATMAN BACK TO FOIL OR MASTERMIND STOCK RAID... \nFOX I didn't need to. Page three. Wayne turns the page: \nWAYNE DOUBLES DOWN - AND LOSES... \nFOX It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange. Verified by thumb print. The options expired at midnight last night. Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling. \nFOX Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now...you're completely broke. And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett. \nWAYNE The weapons - we can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences - \nFOX Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books. The energy project is a different story. \nWAYNE Miranda Tate. We need to convince the board to get behind her. Let's show her the reactor - \nFOX We're meeting her there in thirty-five minutes. You better get dressed. \nEXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES RECYCLING PLANT - DAY \nA scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car. \nMIRANDA You brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox? \nFOX Bear with me, Miss Tate. They arrive at a Portakabin and enter. \nINT. PORTAKABIN - CONTINUOUS \nMiranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at her. \nFOX Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times. He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked as the office becomes an elevator into - \nINT. ELEVATOR, FUSION REACTOR - CONTINUOUS \nThey descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel... \nMIRANDA This is it, isn't it? \nFOX The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach. \nMIRANDA Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid? \nFOX I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one. Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a figure deep within: Bruce Wayne. \nWAYNE I thought you might like to see what your investment built. \nMIRANDA No radiation, no fossil fuels. Free, clean energy for an entire city. \nWAYNE If it worked. It doesn't. Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal. Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold. \nWAYNE Ignition, yes. But no chain reaction. \nMIRANDA You've built a lot of security around a damp squib. Nothing. About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started developing problems... (Looks at Wayne.) I think this machine works. \nWAYNE Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great. \nMIRANDA Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago? \nWAYNE Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor. \nMIRANDA And to do what with it? \nWAYNE Nothing. Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety. \nMIRANDA And if we can't? \nWAYNE Decommission it. Flood it. \nMIRANDA Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future? \nWAYNE If the world's not ready. Yes. \nMIRANDA Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it. \nBLAKE It was damn good to see him back. \nWAYNE Not everybody agrees. \nBLAKE They'll figure it out in the end. \nWAYNE Got anything on Bane's whereabouts? \nBLAKE Yeah, I've got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight. I could use some help. \nWAYNE \n(THINKS) You know what? Drop me in Old Town... \nEXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY \nBlake drops Wayne off. \nWAYNE Don't wait. I'll get a cab. \nBLAKE You got money? \nWAYNE (smiles, sheepish) Actually, no. Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street. The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off. \nINT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nSelina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell. \nJEN (O.S.) I told you, money first. \nWAYNE (O.S.) I don't think so. \nINT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nSelina finds Wayne standing there with Jen. \nSELINA He's not a mark. Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne. \nSELINA And he doesn't have a cent to his name, anyway. \nINT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nWayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts, embarrassed. \nSELINA Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But it's more that you've got right now. \nWAYNE Actually, they're letting me keep the house. \nSELINA \n(SHAKES HEAD) The rich don't even go broke same as the rest of us, huh? \nWAYNE (spots her bag) Vacation? \nSELINA Let's just say that I've incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you. \nWAYNE My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving. \nSELINA And how would he do that? \nWAYNE By giving you what you want. \nSELINA It doesn't exist. \nWAYNE He says it does. He wants to meet. Tonight. \nSELINA Why? \nWAYNE He needs to find Bane. He thinks you'd know how. \nSELINA Tell him I'll think about it. Wayne nods, starts to leave. \nSELINA Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all your money. \nWAYNE No, you're not. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY \nBlake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for - \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nBlake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley. \nFOLEY Can we help you, officer? \nBLAKE John Daggett's body was found in a dumpster an hour ago. I thought you might like to know. \nGORDON Why? \nBLAKE Because Daggett's name is all over the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham. Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake. \nBLAKE MTA maintenance, sewer construction... \nGORDON \n(TO FOLEY) Where did you get to with the tunnel searches? \nFOLEY \n(TO BLAKE) Remind me to tell the detail to keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.) We've had teams down there, but it's a huge network - \nGORDON Get more men, work a grid. I want him found. \nFOLEY Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're on it. \nGordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake. \nGORDON This is good work. Lose the uniform - you're working for me now. We could use some hotter heads around here. \nINT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \nA Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind. \nCATWOMAN He's behind you. \nMERCENARY \n(SPINS) Who? Batman hangs upside down behind him. \nBATMAN (O.S.) Me. Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel. Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked off his feet by darkness - he screams... Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo... Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel. \nCATWOMAN Just a little further. A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He is deep inside. \nINT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS \nMercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns. \nCATWOMAN I had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me. \nBATMAN You've made a serious mistake. \nBANE (O.S.) Not as serious as yours, I fear. Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls. \nBATMAN Bane. \nBANE Let's not stand on ceremony here, Mr. Wayne. \nCatwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done. Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches his fist. \nBANE Peace has cost you strength. Victory has defeated you. \nBane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk - Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch. \nBANE Theatricality and deception are powerful agents...to the uninitiated. Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate. \nBANE But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce? The League of Shadows. And you betrayed us... \nBATMAN Us? You were excommunicated. From a gang of psychopaths. \nBANE Now I am the League of Shadows, here to fulfill R\u00af's al Gh\u00afl's \nA U destiny... Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them. \nBane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses. Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES... \nBANE You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. No reserves. Admirable. But mistaken. Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once. \nBANE You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it. Formed by it... \nIn the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike... \nBANE I didn't see the light until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing to me but blinding... \nBane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in his grasp. \nBANE The shadows betray you, because they belong to me... \nBane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding, pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS. Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes... \nBANE I will show you where I've made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then...I will break you. \nA Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing: Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble. \nBATMAN No... \nBANE Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it. \nINT. APPLIED SCIENCES - CONTINUOUS \nMercenaries race through the stacks of equipment... \nINT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS \nBatman climbs to his feet, swaying. Bane approaches. \nBANE I wondered which would break first - your spirit... \nBatman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him \nHIGH. ...or your body. Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back with a horrific CRACK. \nIn the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the hollow eyes of his trophy... \nCatwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we - \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nEXT.

The Mayor's box \nEXPLODES... \nThe Receiver, nearing the touchdown, glances back - sees Armageddon - the entire field is now a smoking mass of rubble, but for one strip of turf...Mercenaries pour out of the tunnel, creating a gauntlet... \nINT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nBlake's cruiser swerves to avoid eruptions of asphalt. An eruption TOSSES Blake's cruiser onto its roof. \nEXT. GOTHAM RIVER - CONTINUOUS \nAll bridges, except the Gotham Bridge, suffer controlled demolitions. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \nBane steps into the smoking stadium, a gladiator walking into the arena...TV cameras swing onto him.

OVERTURNED CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS \nBlake squeezes out of his cruiser, reaches in for the radio. \nBLAKE Foley? \nFOLEY \n(OVER RADIO) Jesus, Blake!

BLAKE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nThis gets Blake's attention. Gordon watches, uneasy... \nEXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS \nBane unfolds the pages of Gordon's undelivered speech... \nBANE 'The truth about Harvey Dent is simple in only one regard - it has been hidden for too long. After his devastating injuries, Harvey's mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face. He was a broken, dangerous man, not the crusader for justice that I, James Gordon, have portrayed him to be for the last eight years. Harvey's rage was indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He held my family at gunpoint, then fell to his death in the struggle over my son's life. The Batman did not murder Harvey Dent - he saved \n(MORE) \nBANE (CONT'D) my boy. Then took the blame for Harvey's appalling crimes, so that I could, to my shame, build a lie around this fallen idol.' \nINT.

Selina watches... \nEXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS \nBANE Do you accept the resignation of all the liars?! All the corrupt?! More and more of the crowd is chanting 'Yes!' \nINT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nBlake turns to Gordon, who stares at the TV. \nBLAKE These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. Based on a lie. \nGORDON A lie to keep a city from burning to the ground. Gotham needed a hero, someone to believe in - \nBLAKE Not as much as it does now. But you betrayed everything you stood for. \nGORDON (looks at Blake) There's a point. Far out there. When the structures fail you. When the rules aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad get ahead. Maybe one day you'll have such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did. To plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean. \nBLAKE Your hands look pretty filthy to me, Commissioner. \nGordon stares at him. Blake goes back to packing. \nEXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS \nBane signals a Tumbler - its turret turns to the prison doors. \nBANE We take Gotham from the corrupt. The rich.

Do as you please... \nThe Tumbler fires, blowing the doors to hell. \n(MORE) \nBANE (CONT'D) But start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed...

With all your strength and resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you could achieve was a lie. Finally you understand...

Is the \nCOMMISSIONER - \nBLAKE Less you know, Father. How're the boys? \nFATHER REILLY Power's been on more, so they get some TV. \nBlake smiles. Moves to the door. Blake, you be careful out there. They're hunting down cops like dogs. \nBlake nods. Leaves. \nINT. ELEGANT APARTMENT, PARK BOULEVARD - DAWN \nFollowing Selina through rooms strewn with trash, empty bottles and sleeping partygoers. She spots a family photograph, glass smashed. A hand lands on her shoulder. \nJEN Who's that? \nSELINA This was someone's home. \nJEN Now it's everyone's home. \nSelina stares out at a Tumbler rolling by. \nJEN 'Storm's coming', remember?

STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY \nWayne moves to the wall - takes the rope from the Tattooed Prisoner, wraps it around his chest. Curious Prisoners gather, the Prisoner at their head. Wayne looks up at the light, hundreds of feet above. Starts to climb. Prisoners get excited as Wayne RISES - money starts exchanging hands. Reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the next handhold, far away. He takes a breath, then LEAPS. His fingers brush the ledge. Wayne DROPS a hundred feet - the rope catches, SLAMMING him into the rock face. The Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner lowers Wayne on the rope. The Blind Prisoner turns away. \nPRISONER I told you it could not be done. \nWAYNE You told me a child did it... \nPRISONER No ordinary child... INSERT CUT: the Protector fights off prisoners as the Child, older now, moves to the climbing wall A child born in hell. INSERT CUT: the Child makes the climb...pauses, looking down - making eye-contact with the Protector, who fights off Prisoners... They swarm over the Protector, knives drawn. A child forged by suffering, hardened by pain... INSERT CUT: the Child leaps across the abyss, grabbing a handhold on the ledge and swinging up... Not a man from privilege. \nWayne's eyes close in despair. \nFOX It was built as a fusion reactor. The first of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor. \nBLAKE And here's the important part. \nFOX As the device's fuel cells decay, it's becoming increasingly unstable...until the point of detonation. \nBLAKE The bomb's a time bomb. \nFOX And it will go off. In twenty-three days. Captain Jones reels at this news. \nBLAKE Bane's revolution is a sham. He's watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship's going down. Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought. Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox. \nCAPTAIN JONES Could you disarm it? \nFOX I don't know, But I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it. \nCAPTAIN JONES We'd have to let the Pentagon know. \nSPECIAL FORCES 2 They'll be monitoring our \nFREQUENCIES - \nCAPTAIN JONES We have no choice.

Bane enters, midges Jones with his toe. He is alive. Barely. Bane leans in close. Jones looks up at him, defiant. \nCAPTAIN JONES I'll die before I talk... \nBANE I'm on your schedule, Captain. \nBane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth. \nMERCERNARY There were people living upstairs. \nBane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead. \nBANE Give them over for judgement. (Indicates bodies.) Hang them where the world will see. \nINT.

SAME - LATER \nWayne does endless push-ups, squats, stretches. The Blind Prisoner listens. He speaks in an ancient tongue. \nPRISONER He says the leap to freedom is not about strength. \nWAYNE My body makes the jump. \nBLIND PRISONER \n(CRACKED ENGLISH) Survival is the spirit. The soul. \nWAYNE My soul's as ready to escape as my body. \nBLIND PRISONER Fear is why you fail. \nWAYNE I'm not afraid. I'm angry. \nWayne throws punches...focused. \nINT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY \nWayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts climbing, determined. He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock - it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head. A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up at Wayne, hanging upside down. \nSKINNY PRISONER Shouldn't you get him down? The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful. \nPRISONER He'll keep. As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we - INSERT CUT: Young Bruce lies at the bottom of the well, looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him. \nTHOMAS WAYNE (V.O.) And why do we fall? \nINT. CAVE PRISON - NIGHT \nWayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there. \nBLIND PRISONER \n(CRACKED ENGLISH) You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong. This makes you weak. \nWAYNE Why? \nBLIND PRISONER How can you move faster then possible? Fight longer than possible? If not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit. The fear of death. The will to survive. Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner. \nWAYNE I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it. \nBLIND PRISONER Then make the climb. \nWAYNE How? \nBLIND PRISONER As the child did. Without the rope. (Dry laugh.) Then fear will find you again. Wayne considers this. \nEXT. OUTFLOW PIPE, ACKERMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS \nMercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign. One of them moves out to get a better look.

Blake watches, in awe, as Batman takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly. \nBLAKE You missed a spot. Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake. \nBATMAN If you're working alone, wear a mask. \nBLAKE No one cares who I am. \nBATMAN The mask is not for you. It's to protect the people you care about. \nBLAKE Huh. And you always seem to know where those people are. How is that? \nBATMAN I lost someone once. Since then I break into their homes when they're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck. \nBlake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses Blake a mini-mine. \nBATMAN On three - one, two, three - They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance - the blasts barely move any rubble. \nBLAKE No offense, but you got anything bigger in that belt? \nBATMAN That's to warn the men on the other side. Batman disappears into the shadows. \nBLAKE But how do we -? KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night. \nBLAKE Okay. \nCops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but glad to be alive and carrying guns... \nBLAKE What now? \nBATMAN All-out assault on Bane...but you need to get the people you care about across the bridge. \nBLAKE Why? \nBATMAN In case we fail. Lead an exodus across the bridge. Save as many lives as you can. \nBLAKE Don't you need me here? \nBATMAN You've given me an army. Now go. Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops. \nBLAKE Thank you. \nBATMAN Don't thank me yet. \nBLAKE I might not get a chance later. \nBatman nods. Blake disappears into the night. \nEXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS \nGordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS... \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nBatman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it, revealing the Bat-Pod. Catwoman's eyes light up. \nCATWOMAN Oh, you shouldn't have... She hops on, feeling the controls. \nBATMAN The mid-town tunnel's blocked by debris, but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path for people. \nCatwoman marvels at the controls... \nBATMAN To start it, you - \nVARROOOM! \nCATWOMAN I got it. \nBATMAN We've got forty-five minutes to save this city - \nCATWOMAN No, I've got forty-five minutes to get clear of the blast radius, because you don't stand a chance against these guys. \nBATMAN With your help I might. \nShe shakes her head. \nCATWOMAN I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone. \nHe looks at her. \nBATMAN There's more to you than that. She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch. \nCATWOMAN Sorry to keep letting you down. He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring. Come with me. Save yourself. You don't owe these people anymore - you've given them everything... \nBATMAN Not everything. Not yet. \nBatman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the bike and takes off. \nEXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - NIGHT \nCatwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod. She pulls up at the tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAWN \nBANE Goodbye. Then is overrun. \nTALIA I climbed out of the pit... INSERT CUT: Young Talia stands by the hole looking out at the landscape... I found my father and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance - but by that time...the prisoners and the doctor had done their work to my friend...my protector... Talia reaches up to touch Bane's mask. \nINSERT CUT: the League of Shadows descend into the prison - at their head, R\u00af's al Gh\u00afl. They slaughter prisoners. Then \nA U stop. R\u00af's al Gh\u00afl has found Bane, bandaged. \nA U \nTALIA The League took us in. Trained us... \nINT. TEMPLE, LEAGUE OF SHADOWS - DAY \nBane in a prototype mask, stands on logs, blocking blows from men with sticks. \nTALIA (V.O.) But my father could not accept Bane. R\u00af's al Gh\u00afl watches Bane training. Turns away. \nA U \nINT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS \nTalia looks into Bane's eyes as she holds the knife in Batman's side. \nTALIA He saw only a monster who could never be tamed. Whose very existence was a reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in. He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. His only crime was that he loved me. I could not truly forgive my father... Talia looks at Batman, cold. Until you murdered him. \nBATMAN He was trying to kill millions of innocent people - \nTALIA 'Innocent' is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience... \nTalia twists the knife in Batman's side. You see, it's the slow knife...the knife that takes its time, the \n(MORE) \nTALIA (CONT'D) knife that waits years without forgetting, then slips quietly between bones...that's the knife - Talia arms the trigger... - that cuts deepest. She hits the button - nothing. \nEXT. FIFTH STREET - CONTINUOUS \nA light on the metal box is blinking. Gordon hangs on - \nINT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS \nTalia turns, furious. \nBATMAN Your knife may have been too slow... A Mercenary steps forward - \nMERCENARY The truck's under attack - Talia looks around, mind racing. \nTALIA Gordon. (To Batman.) You gave him a way to block my signal. No matter - (Looks at watch.) He's bought Gotham eleven minutes. (Shouts at Mercenary.) Prepare a convoy. We must secure the bomb until it detonates. Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a Mercenary - points it at Batman. \nTALIA Not yet... I want him to feel the heat. (To Batman.) Feel the fire of twelve million souls you failed. Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes, tenderly. Goodbye, my friend. Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the Mercenaries. \nEXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS \nTalia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary. Three Tumblers pull out in convoy, blowing anything out of the way - cars, cops. \nFoley stands in the road, firing his sidearm. Talia's Tumbler SMASHES him out of the way. \nINT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS \nBane grabs Batman, throws him into the floor - checks the rounds in the barrels. \nBANE You'll have to imagine the fire - \nHe shuts the gun - jams it into Batman's face. We both know I need to kill you now. He squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the lobby by cannon fire. Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod. \nCATWOMAN The whole no-guns thing? I don't feel as strongly about it as you do. \nEXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS \nBlake pulls up to the barricade, leads the kids off, marching them up the bridge, Father Reilly at the rear. A Uniform shouts through the loudhailer - \nUNIFORM Stay there! What are you doing?! \nBLAKE \n(PULLS BADGE) Blake, MCU - I'm getting these boys to safety - \nUNIFORM Safety?! You're gonna get us all killed. Anyone crosses this bridge they blow the city - \nBLAKE It's gonna blow anyway. We need this bridge open right now. \nUNIFORM No one leaves the island. Orders - \nBLAKE Whose orders? Bane's? \nUNIFORM Police Department's. \nBLAKE Haven't you heard the shooting? The Batman's battling it out with Bane \nUNIFORM The Batman's dead. Look, Officer - \nBLAKE It's Detective - \nUNIFORM Well, Detective, you take one more step, we have to shoot you. Two more steps, we have to blow the bridge. \nBLAKE (to the boys) Wait for me back at the bus. The Boys walk back down the bridge... \nEXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nTalia's convoy surrounds the black truck. Tumblers off each flank, protecting the bomb as it counts down... \nINT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS \nBatman looks at Catwoman. \nBATMAN I need you on the ground, me in the air, we have to force that convoy east, to the entrance to the \nREACTOR - \nTALIA There is no way to stop this bomb. Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at Batman.) My father's work is done. \nTalia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns - Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to attach a hoist from the Bat. \nGORDON What're you doing? \nBATMAN Two minutes. I can fly it out over the bay... \nCatwoman is at his side as he works. \nCATWOMAN Rig it out to fly over the water, then bail - \nBATMAN No autopilot. She takes this in. He stands to face her. \nCATWOMAN You could've gone anywhere. Been anything. But you came back here. \nBATMAN So did you. \nCATWOMAN I guess we're both suckers. She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves to the Bat, Gordon alongside. \nGORDON So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you don't come back? \nBatman opens the canopy. \nEXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS \nBlake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus. \nBLAKE Come on! On the bus! \nFATHER REILLY What're you doing? \nBLAKE Protection from the blast - \nFATHER REILLY It's an atom bomb -! \nBlake turns on Father Reilly, furious. \nBLAKE You think they need to hear that in their last seconds? You think I'm going to let them die without hope? \nEXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS \nGordon puts a hand on Batman's arm. \nGORDON I never cared who you were - \nBATMAN And you were right. \nGORDON But shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them? \nBATMAN A hero can be anyone. That was always the point. \nBatman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon. Anyone. A man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended... The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers \nINSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring, loving. Gordon looks up to the cockpit - \nGORDON Bruce Wayne? - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the tunnel mouth. \nThe Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but there's no power to get over it. \nEXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS \nBlake shouts into the bus - \nBLAKE Heads down! Heads down, now! \nFATHER REILLY Blake, they need to make their peace. Blake turns to him, furious. \nBLAKE They're children! They have no peace to make - An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across, startled, turns to the children on the bus. Get down! This is it! The smallest of the boys stares through the window past Blake. \nLITTLE BOY No. That's Batman! Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth of the river...the bay...the ocean... Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham... \nAs the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon. \nGORDON (V.O.) 'I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss...' Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river. \nGORDON (V.O.) 'I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy...' \nEXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR - DAY \nGordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is there, whose face we do not yet see... \nGORDON 'I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...' Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave. 'It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.' \nGordon looks up at the figure standing across from him... Alfred. Tears streaming. Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves. Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of Thomas and Martha Wayne. \nALFRED I'm so sorry. I failed you. You trusted me, and I failed you. And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs. \nEXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nGordon nods at Lucius. Blake is at Gordon's side. \nGORDON Can I change your mind about quitting the force? \nBLAKE No. What you said about structures. About shackles. I can't take it. The injustice. (Gestures at gardens.) I mean...no one's ever going to know who saved an entire city. \nGORDON They know. (Off look.) It was Batman. \nEXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY \nGordon, on a platform with dignitaries, watches a statue being unveiled. The curtain parts: Batman, immortalized in granite. We move in on the stone face... \nVOICE (V.O.) Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to reflect his more modest estate... \nINT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe voice belongs to Wayne's lawyer, addressing a small group. \nLAWYER Nonetheless, there are considerable assets to dispose of... The contents of the house are to be \n", "test1_input": "High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching. \nMAYOR (O.S) Now I'm going to give way to an important voice... \nDown below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in. \nCONGRESSMAN Commissioner. \nGORDON Congressman. \nCONGRESSMAN Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things? Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley, cuts in. \nFOLEY No one has. Not in years. \nMAYOR (O.S) He can tell you about the bad old days, when the criminals and corrupt ran this town with such a tight grasp that people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape. A thug who showed his true nature when he betrayed the trust of this great man - (Turns to picture of Dent.) And murdered him in cold blood. The Congressman watches a tray of canap\u00e9s breeze past, then grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes. \nCONGRESSMAN Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow. \nMAID (turns, tight smile) Shrimp balls? The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers. \nMAYOR (O.S) Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent... \nCONGRESSMAN Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech? We're gonna be here all night. \nGORDON Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't so simple, Congressman. \nMAYOR (O.S) But I'll let him tell you himself - Commissioner Gordon? Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long speech. Thinks. \nGORDON The truth...? INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens Gordon's son with a handgun. \nGordon surveys the audience. Deciding. I have written a speech telling the truth about Harvey Dent... Gordon folds up his speech. Maybe the time isn't right... Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman mutters under his breath. \nCONGRESSMAN Thank Christ for that... \nGORDON Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act. These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now, all I should say about Harvey Dent's death is this...it has not been for nothing. The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion. People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches Foley. \nGORDON The second shift reports in? \nFOLEY On your desk. But you should put in some more time with the Mayor - \nGORDON That's your department. \nGordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive. \nCONGRESSMAN Anyone shown him the crime stats? \nFOLEY He goes by his gut, and it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers. \nCONGRESSMAN Must be popular with the wife. \nFOLEY Not really. She took the kids and moved to Cleveland. \nCONGRESSMAN He'll have plenty of time for visits. Mayor's dumping him in the spring. \nFOLEY Really? He's a hero. \nCONGRESSMAN War hero. This is peacetime. Stay smart, the job's yours. \nINT. KITCHENS, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER \nOur Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs - Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid. \nMAID 2 They say he never leaves the East Wing. \nMAID 3 I heard he had an accident - that he's disfigured. \nThe other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has died. Alfred has entered the kitchen. \nALFRED Mr. Till, why are your people using the main stairs? Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen. \nALFRED Where's Mrs. Bolton? \nMAID She's up at the bar, sir. Can I help? \nAlfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray. \nALFRED The East drawing room. Unlock the door, place the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more. \nThe Maid nods. Takes the tray. \nINT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER \nFollowing the Maid through the empty house. She comes to the large oak door to the East Wing. Unlocks it... \nINT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nThe room is dark, quiet. The Maid places the tray on the table. She looks at the inner door opposite. It is ajar... \nINT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nAlfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate. \nALFRED I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've tried. He won't see you. \nMIRANDA It's important, Mr. Pennyworth. Her accent is European. Hard to place. \nALFRED Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Don't take it personally, Miranda. \nThey turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett. \nDAGGETT Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in there with eight-inch nails, peeing into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good of you to let me on the grounds. \nALFRED The Dent Act is about all Gotham. Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate, always a pleasure. Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib. \nDAGGETT Why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project? He can't help you get your money back. But I can. \nMIRANDA I could try explaining that a save-the-world project, vain or not, is worth investing in, whatever the return. I could try, Mr. Daggett, but you understand only money and the power you think it buys, so why waste my time, indeed? \n", "test1_true": "INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nClose on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach. Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples. He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing something. He slowly limps into the next room... \nINT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS \nThe Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered. Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite bow. Picks up his cane. \nMAID I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne. It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it? \nWayne nods, gently. Limps towards her. \nMAID Although you don't have the long nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial scars... She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young. \nWAYNE Is that what they say about me? \nMAID It's just that...nobody sees you... \nWayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace. \nWAYNE That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother. It can't be the same one - her pearls are in this safe - He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the bureau, revealing a safe door... - which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable. \n...which swings open with an awkward creak. \nMAID Oops. No one told me it was uncrackable. \nThe Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older. \nWAYNE I'm afraid I can't let you take those. \nShe smiles at him. Moves towards him. \nMAID Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any more than I would beat up a cripple. She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down. Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made. \nThe Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window. Goodnight, Mr. Wayne. She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace. He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder... \nEXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nMoving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she slips into a town car...beside the Congressman. \nMAID Can I have a ride? The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily. \nCONGRESSMAN You read my mind. \nINT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - LATER \nAlfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe. \nALFRED Miss Tate was asking to see you again. \nWAYNE She's very persistent. \nALFRED And quite lovely, in case you were wondering. \nWAYNE I wasn't. \nALFRED What are you doing? \nWAYNE Examining print dust. We've been robbed. \nALFRED And this is your idea of raising the alarm? \nWAYNE \n(SHRUGS) She took the pearls. Tracking device and all. \nALFRED She? \nWAYNE One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house. \nALFRED Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then. Why are you dusting for prints? \nWAYNE I'm not. She was. \nEXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT - CONTINUOUS \nGordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight. \nYOUNG VOICE (O.S.) Sir? \nA young Cop is standing there. This is Blake. \nBLAKE I didn't want to bother you up here, but they're looking for you. \nGORDON What's the problem, son? \nBLAKE Congressman Gilly's wife's been calling. He hasn't made it home from the Wayne Foundation event. \nGORDON That's a job for the police? \nBLAKE Sir, I've been a cop for a year and I've only logged half a dozen arrests. When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good. Pretty soon we'll be chasing overdue library books. Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files. \nBLAKE But here you are. Like we're still at war... \nGORDON Old habits. \nBLAKE Or instinct. \nGORDON What's your name, son? \nBLAKE Blake, sir. \nGORDON You have something you want to ask me, Officer Blake? \nBLAKE It's that night.

Gordon takes this in...Foley bursts in, agitated. \nFOLEY Okay, Commissioner, you were right. \nGORDON What's happened? \nFOLEY Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board. He let most of them go, but took three down into the sewers. \nGORDON No more patrols, no more hide and seek. Send every available cop down there to smoke him out. \nFOLEY The Mayor won't want panic - \nBLAKE So it's a training exercise. \nFoley looks at Gordon. \nFOLEY I'm sorry for not taking you \nSERIOUSLY - \nGORDON Don't apologize for believing the world's in better shape then it is...just fight to make it true. \nFoley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up. \nGORDON Not you. You're telling me the Batman's gone. So you chase up the Daggett leads, any way you can. \nBlake nods. \nINT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY \nWayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue. \nPRISONER He asks if you would pay us to let you die. I told him you have nothing. \nWAYNE Do it for the pleasure. \nThe Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips. \nPRISONER They pay me more than that to keep you alive. \nA chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other Prisoners. \nPRISONER He will try the climb. Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant grows stronger as he climbs towards the light. \nAbove: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor. \nWAYNE Has anyone made it? \nPRISONER Of course not. \nThe Blind Prisoner barks at him. \nWAYNE What does he say? \nPRISONER He says there is one who did. A child... INSERT CUT: a child of about ten looks up towards the light. \nPRISONER A child who had been born in this hell... \nWAYNE Bane. \nPRISONER An old legend. Nothing more.

Thousands of Police head into manholes, tunnel entrances, checking weapons, using flashlights... \nINT. MASSIVE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \nBane leads the way over rubble into the REACTOR. Dr. Pavel follows. Bane approaches the machine. Turns to Fox. \nBANE Turn it on. \nFox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head. \nBANE I only need one other board member. There are eight more waiting upstairs. \nFOX I won't do it. Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon. \nMIRANDA Alright, stop. She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading. \nMIRANDA Lucius, you'll kill this man and yourself, and barely slow them down. Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then Fredericks.

Anything strange about the pourings? Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations. \nBLAKE Honestly, Commissioner, I don't know anything about civil engineering. \nGORDON But you know about patterns. Keep looking. Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant. \nINT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS \nDr. Pavel finishes his work. Turns to Bane. Grave. \nDR. PAVEL It's done. This is now a four-megaton nuclear bomb. \nBANE (to his men) Pull the core out of the reactor. \nDR. PAVEL \n(HORRIFIED) You can't. This is the only power source capable of sustaning it - if you move it, the core will decay in a matter of months. \nBANE Five, by my calculations. \nDR.

The Worker lunges with a knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him. The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the Driver is strong, trained. Blake can't aim his gun, he fires behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake, gasping, kneels beside the Driver. \nBLAKE What were you doing?! What?! \nThe man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials. \nBLAKE Commissioner, I'm at the Fourteenth Street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me - \nBlake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some empty barrels...

CRUISER OUTSIDE CEMENT PLANT - MOMENTS LATER \nBlake grabs his carts - scanning the pattern of the dots - realizes. \nBLAKE Oh, God. \nBlake fires up the cruiser and pulls out, hard. \nINT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nBlake is driving furiously, shouting into the radio - \nBLAKE Patch me into Foley! \nDISPATCH \n(OVER RADIO) Foley's overseeing the operation - \nBLAKE They're heading into a trap! \nEXT. MTA TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER (DAY) \nFoley, concerned, takes the radio from a colleague. \nFOLEY Foley. \nBLAKE It's a trap! Pull everyone out! Bane's been pouring concrete laced with explosives - \nFOLEY Where? \nBLAKE There's a ring around the tunnels - they're gonna blow it and trap the cops underground! Foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel. \n", "test2_id": 652, "test3_input": "GORDON Miss Tate, I can't ask you - \nMIRANDA My company built it. \nGORDON Bruce Wayne built it. \nMIRANDA And he wanted to destroy it. It was me who didn't listen. Please. Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods. \nGORDON Let's go. \nEXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY \nA Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two Gangbangers. The Kid slips in the snow - the men are on him. \nGANGBANGER You steal from us, you little bastard? They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks. Selina catches the apple. \nSELINA You boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely. \nGangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off, howling. The Kid eyes her, wary. \nSELINA Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid. \nKID Now you're gonna take it. \nSelina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite. \nSELINA Just tax. She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs. \nWAYNE (O.S.) Pretty generous, for a thief. Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong, but weathered. Beard, work clothes. \nSELINA You came back. I thought they'd killed you. \nWAYNE Not yet. \nSELINA If you're expecting an apology - \nWAYNE It wouldn't suit you. I need your help. \nSELINA And why would I help you? \nWayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket. \nWAYNE For this. The 'Clean Slate'. \nSELINA You're gonna trust me with that? After what I did to you? \nWAYNE I admit I felt a little let down. But I still think there's more to you. In fact, I think for you - (indicates USB) this isn't a tool, it's an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh. \nShe looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it. \nSELINA Start fresh? I can't even get off this island. \nWAYNE I can give you a way off. Once you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I need you to find out where they're holding him. Then take me in. \nSELINA Why do you need Fox? \nWAYNE To save this city. \nSELINA Who says it needs saving? Maybe I like it this way. \nWAYNE Maybe you do. But tomorrow that bomb's going off. \nSELINA Get your powerful friend on the case. \nWAYNE I'm trying. But I need Fox. \nEXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY \nGordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter. \nGORDON Stay further up the block. (Points at Men.) They're gonna cross the street and try and slow the truck down. As it approaches, hit this button. If the needle hits two hundred - give me the signal and I mark the truck. Okay? \nBLAKE \n(OVER RADIO) Heads up. \nBlake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon's Men walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS locator at the lower part of the truck... \nGordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS. \nGORDON Got it. \nThey keep moving, turning down the next street...into an ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained. \nMERCENARY Commissioner Gordon, you're under arrest. \nGORDON On whose authority? \nMERCERNARY The people of Gotham. \nBlake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and the other Cops being rounded up and led away... \nINT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY \nMiranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner. Thugs come down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner. They kick him down the last step and he stumbles. Fox moves to his aid. \nBASEMENT THUG 1 Find this one a spot, he's got a big day tomorrow. They dump the Hooded Man with Fox. \nBASEMENT THUG 2 We all do. It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne... Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Wayne's head. Wayne nods at him, silent. Fox nods back. The Thugs leave. Miranda comes over. \nMIRANDA Bruce? \nFOX You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne. \nWAYNE How long until the core ignites? \nFOX That bomb goes off in twelve hours. \nWAYNE Unless we can connect it to the reactor. \n", "test3_true": "WAYNE Not tonight. I'm sorry. \nMIRANDA Do what's necessary. \nWAYNE \n(TO FOX) Tonight I need you. \nFOX What for? \nWAYNE To get me back in the game. Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs. \nCATWOMAN Sorry to spoil things, boys, but Bane wants these guys himself... The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks up. \nWAYNE I won't forget about you. \nMIRANDA I know. \nEXT. COLONNADE, HOLDING AREA - CONTINUOUS \nThe Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade. Catwoman spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to the throat. Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists. \nFOX I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne. \nCATWOMAN He should be so lucky. And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs. \nINT. DARK SPACE - NIGHT \nLights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker. \nWAYNE Any move I make against Bane or the bomb - the triggerman sets it off. \nFOX They can't be using radio or cell - too much interference. Infrared doesn't have the range. It could only be micro-burst long wave... Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment: mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt... \nWAYNE Could you block it? \nFOX Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance mount from the Bat. You remember where you parked? Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor... \nINT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING (LATE DAY) \nGordon and his men on trial. Crane presides. \nCRANE The charges are espionage and attempted sabotage... Do you have anything to say in your defense? \nGORDON No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort of due process is this? \nCRANE More than you give Harvey's prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt is determined, this is merely a sentencing hearing. What's it to be, death or exile? \nGORDON Crane, if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice, you've got another think coming. \nCRANE Death, then? \nGORDON Looks that way. \nCRANE Very well... Death... (Smiles.) By exile. \nHe smashes his gavel. Bane leans in to one of his men, indicates Miranda. \nBANE Bring her to me. \nINT. STAIRWELL, SKYSCRAPER - SUNSET \nWayne bounds up the stairs. Fox follows, out of breath \nLUCIUS I think it's time to talk about my year-end bonus... \nEXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER \nFox emerges to see Wayne uncovering the Bat... As the sun sets, Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount. \nFOX She fly pretty well? \nWAYNE Even without the autopilot... \nFOX Autopilot? That's what you're there for. \nEXT. GOTHAM RIVER - NIGHT \nGordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice. A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath, then leads his men onto the ice...which creaks and groans... Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of liquid, beside it: a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled. \nBATMAN (O.S.) Light it up. \nGordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare - jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a \nBAT... \nINT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE - CONTINUOUS \nFOLEY'S KIDS Dad! Check it out! \nFOLEY'S WIFE Honey, take a look! Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign. \nEXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS \nA Mercenary nervously approaches Bane's back. \nMERCENARY Sir? \nBane turns. The Mercenary points at the sign. \nMERCENARY You think it's really him? \nBANE Impossible... \nINT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nFoley yanks up the floorboards. Pull his dress blues from their hiding place. \n", "test3_id": 653}

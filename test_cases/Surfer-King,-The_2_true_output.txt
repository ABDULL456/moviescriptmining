LEAD MARCHER Sound off! 
GROUNDS KIDS Trash rats! 
LEAD MARCHER Sound off trash rats! 
GROUNDS KIDS Trash rats! Trash rats! 
They clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit. 
All is quiet now. WE SEE concessions kids sitting, grounds kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see lifeguards sitting. Everyone is looking around. 
Suddenly two lifeguards dressed as Roman Soldiers appear with horns. They bellow a Roman Call to Action, and two Roman drummers lead a column of other lifeguards.

First we see female guards dressed in togas filing in. Behind them are six gladiators with swords and shields, marching. 
They are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of rose petals. She is throwing them into the path of the next group to enter. 
Next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying COWBOY, who is sitting up on a First Aid backboard. HE is wearing laurel leaves and a toga, he is obviously Cesar. On the backboard is also the surfer king trophy. 
They all approach the area in front of the seated guards, and rearrange themselves so that COWBOY has a good view of the gladiators. The drummers count a cadence that sets the pace for a simulated battle between the gladiators. 
The simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are on their knees before the three victorious gladiators. The victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones, and look to COWBOY for a yea or nay. 
COWBOY generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the swords are put away. The seated lifeguards all raise their fists and shout. 
LIFEGUARDS (together) Lifeguards! Lifeguards!     Lifeguards! 
The guards holding COWBOY set him down in front of an elevated platform that has a microphone.. 
COWBOY picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the platform. He sets the trophy on a table next to the microphone, arranging it carefully. 
We see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the wave pool that says "WATER WORLD WELCOMES EMPLOYEE OLYMPIANS". 
COWBOY moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal manner and speaks. 
COWBOY (to all) Let the games...begin! 
The seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly. We see a group of three people, two male and one female, adults we will later identify as JUDGES. They nod approvingly and write something down on their clipboards. We see BIG MIKE near them, smiling broadly. 
59        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE            59 
We see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the area is clear. There are scattered squashed up pieces of white paper lying about.

We look to the south and see that there are three boy/girl teams with one of their legs tied together, like a three legged race. 
The rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the other team member has the broom. A JUDGE triggers a starter pistol and they are off. 
The lifeguard team falls almost immediately, and the grounds team takes a early lead over the concessions team, who are trying to figure the dustpan/broom operation out. The two grounds people work tightly together and quickly advance. 
The lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up to their first piece of trash. Concessions has figured out the dustpan, but are still well behind the grounds kids. 
Finally, the grounds kids win, with concessions up second, and lifeguards trailing in third. The judges note the finish on their clipboards. 
60        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - THUNDER BAY                              60 
We see three male participants standing in the shallow end of Thunder Bay, One red suit (lifeguard) one blue suit (concessions) and one green suit (grounds) 
A JUDGE on the rise to the west of Thunder Bay blows an air horn to start the race. They all rush into the bay and begin swimming furiously.

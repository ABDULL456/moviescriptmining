ANASTASIA 
FADE IN: 
on a well-worn PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM. An ELDERLY WOMAN'S HAND touched the album, caressing it lovingly for a moment, as WE HEAR her voice. 
TATIANA (O.C.) Once we lived in an enchanted world. . . 
She opend the ALBUM to reveal a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of the PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG on a brilliant summer day. 
TATIANA (CONT) A world of Tsars and Princesses and elegant palaces. . . 
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER TO the picture. . . 
TATIANA (CONT) and grand parties. . . 
The PHOTO dissolves into REALITY in brilliant color as the day turns into night and the summer cools into winter. We see the palace at night, blanketed in a beautiful, almost glowing, snow as hourse drawn carriages pull up to the front door. 
TATIANA (CONT) A beautiful, magical time. . . 
MOVE INTO THE PALACE 
TATIANA (CONT) That would soon be gone forever. . . 
INT.  PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHT 
Elegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as an ORCHESTRA plays. 
All eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS which descend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase. Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager Empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is seemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are with her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her daughters - well,  all her daughters except. . . 
ANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the party, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a SERVENT (SONYA) 16,  who is trying to catch up with Anastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair. 
SONYA (whispering) Princess Anastasia - you're late and it's all my  fault! 
ANASTASIA Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll notice. . . 
Just then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair, stopping Anastasia with a 
ANASTASIA (loudly) . . .  owwwwwwwww! 
All eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that she's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous smile and descends the staircase in grand style. As the ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back, Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride. 
Tatiana sees her and can't help but smile. 
The music suddenly becomes  a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS. SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY steps out and begins a proccession through their subjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she makes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by large, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of energy and confidence for a girl her age. 
"THE RULARS OF RUSSIA"  (OPENING NUMBER) 
The elegant guests sing their admiration as the beautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance into the ball, they're "the  pride of all Russia". Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire glittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING WALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will rule forever. 
During the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful COUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including Anastasia dancing gracefully with her father.

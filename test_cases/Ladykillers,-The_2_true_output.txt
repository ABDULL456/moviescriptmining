VOICES Mm-mm. Glory hallelujah. 
A lady holding a teacup turns to the General: 
LADY That was soooome poem. 
The General stares at her. 
LADY ...You know any? 
We hear the front door opening and Gawain enters, still wearing his Lady Luck custodial uniform. He looks. 
His POV: church ladies with teacups and his comrades seated among them, also holding teacups and scones. 
GAWAIN Y'all been celebratin'?. 
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - LATER (EVENING) 
The bustling and chattering ladies are just finishing leaving; Mrs. Munson is seeing them off at the door. Evening is gathering, and we hear the lonely toot of the distant garbage scow. 
The men as well stand by the door and, affecting good cheer, wave off the departing ladies. 
DORR Goodbye, ladies. We had such a pleasant time. 
Mrs. Munson closes the door and her manner instantly darkens. 
MRS. MUNSON Now, I wanna know what's goin' on. 
DORR Yes indeed, and the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing. Though in this instance, I believe when you hear the explanation, you will laugh riotously, slappin' your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern. 
MRS. MUNSON Hmph. 
DORR You see Lump here is an enthusiastic collector of Indian arrowheads and, having found one simply lying on your cellar floor, a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe, he enlisted us in an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others. Well, in doing so, we apparently hit a motherlode of natural gas -- I myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs" -- and it was at just this unfortunate moment that the General here violated one of the cardinal rules of this house and lit himself a cigarette. 
The General stiffly bows: 
GENERAL So sorry. 
The Professor, nodding, smiling, and dry-washing his hands, continues to look at Mrs. Munson, though his story, apparently, has ended. 
She returns his ingratiating look with a stare. 
MRS. MUNSON ...What about all that money? 
Dorr's smile fades. 
DORR ...Ah. The money. The money is... Mr. Pancake's. 
PANCAKE That's right. 
DORR He only just re-mortgaged his house in order to pay for the procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common-law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astygmia and strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly. Mr. Pancake however is an ardent foe of the federal reserve and is in fact one of those eccentrics about whom one occasionally reads, hoarding his entire life savings either under the proverbial mattress or, as in Mr. Pancake's case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion. 
Under her stare, he elaborates: 
DORR ...Steel Sack. 
PANCAKE Don't trust the banks. Never have. 
She thinks, decides. 
MRS. MUNSON This don't smell right. I'm callin' Sheriff Wyner. 
A chorus of gasps. 
DORR Madam -- if you please. Yes! Yes! It was a lie! A fantastic tale! You have us! Dead to rights! But please allow me to tell you the truth -- in private. 
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
He escorts her to sit beneath the portrait of Othar, sits across from her, and leans confidentially in. 
DORR Madam... 
He agonizes. The words do not come easy. 
DORR ...What I am about to reveal to you, you may find... shocking. Mrs. Munson, I must tell you that we are not... what we appear. 
MRS. MUNSON Mm-hm. 
DORR We are not in fact musicians of the late Renaissance. Nor of the early or mid period. We are, in fact... criminals! Desperate men, madam! We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Lady Luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure! 
MRS. MUNSON Lord have mercy! 
DORR It is true that the Lady Luck is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of easy winnings. Oh, her gains are ill-gotten, yes, but I offer no excuses -- save one! We men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution -- the General, to a placement service for Southeast Asian refugees; Mr. Pancake to the Blue Ridge Parkway Conservancy; and Lump to the United Jewish Appeal. As compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same. But you have wrested the information from me! Now it is all on the table. Now you have it, the whole story, the awful truth. 
MRS. MUNSON Stolen money! 
DORR Yes, yes, shamefully I admit it, yes! But find the victim, Mrs. Munson, I challenge you! Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorra, shall suffer no harm! It has an insurance company, a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults! That is its function! And the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy-holders so that -- we have done the calculations, Mrs. Munson! -- so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each policy- holder shall have contributed only one penny -- one single solitary cent -- to the satisfaction of this claim. 
MRS. MUNSON ...Just one penny? 
DORR Think of it, Mrs. Munson! One cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission! Why, I have no doubt that, were the policy- holders aware of the existence of that august institution, why, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount to the furtherance of its aims!

CHARLES (rolls down window, loopy) Excuse me. I'm a nonagenarian, actually... 
PIERCE How about you tell me where the girl is first. Or maybe I ought to ask the cue ball. Seems friendly. 
LOGAN I told you, she's not here. Where's Caliban?! 
Pierce smirks, amused by Logan's anger. 
PIERCE I left him in the same hole you were going to leave me. 
Logan loses it, lunges for him -- when someone hits Logan from behind. Hard. And again. As Logan falls to his knees and turns-- SNIKT-- AND SEPARATES A REAVER from his arm. 
LOGAN (TO PIERCE) You got extra barbecue tongs for this guy? 
THE FEDERALE COMMANDER nods. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   34. 
AND A SWARM OF FEDERALES ATTACK LOGAN WITH RIFLE BUTTS AND BOOTS AND BEAT HIM TO THE GROUND. There are too many. 
Pummeled, overwhelmed, his limbs all pinned, Logan turns over to find PIERCE'S FOOT TO HIS THROAT. Pierce leans down. 
PIERCE Jesus. Seeing you this way, Wolverine, it breaks my heart. 
LOGAN As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick. 
Pierce smiles, then nods to one of the Reavers (Mohawk) who jumps off his bike and advances toward a side door of the Smelting Plant. He's carrying a STEEL RESTRAINING COLLAR. 
The Federale Commander shouts to Pierce. 
FEDERALE COMMANDER (IN SPANISH) No one goes in without Federale escort. I am in charge. 
Mohawk pauses. The Commander dispatches two of his Federales to lead him inside, weapons drawn. 
INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - DAY 
THE DOOR OPENS as MOHAWK AND THE TWO FEDERALES creep into the dark room adjacent to the kitchen, advancing toward-- 
Laura at the kitchen table, her back to them. She seems oblivious as she pours more cereal, eats with her spoon. 
One of the Federales accidentally kicks a bottle and Laura pauses her spoon in the air. 
EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY 
ON LOGAN, watching. Charles, watching. 
SUDDENLY, THERE ARE SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE STRUCTURE. Men's screams. Then it is quiet. Everyone turns as -- 
Creeaaak. A STEEL DOOR OPENS WIDE. LAURA steps from the dark into the blazing light. She SQUINTS. 
Pierce steps off Logan, having found his quarry. 
PIERCE That-a-girl. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   35. 
--and now LAURA BOOTS SOMETHING which rolls to Pierce's feet. 
Pierce and the Federale Commander look down at-- A SEVERED HEAD. WITH A MOHAWK. 
THEN SHE TOSSES THE STEEL RESTRAINT COLLAR TO THE DIRT. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) (SIGHS) ...Laura. 
ON LOGAN -- Pulling himself up from the ground as-- 
LAURA-- continues walking toward Pierce. Hands at her sides. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) Laura. Stay where you are. You want to see your friends, right? 
ON PIERCE-- as he nods to the REAVERS to prepare to take her. 
A CYBORG-LEGGED REAVER OPENS THE DOORS OF A CONTAINMENT TANK in back of one of their vehicles. Yet another REAVER (PRETTY BOY, not) assembles A SAVAGE HARPOON AND RESTRAINT SYSTEM. 
But the Federale Commander suddenly orders his men to -- 
FEDERALE COMMANDER Tomar el mutante! 
AND THE CIRCLE OF FEDERALES MOVE IN ON LAURA. 
PIERCE Commander, stop! 
FEDERALE COMMANDER You said alive or dead. 
SNIKT! -- BLOODY CLAWS EXTEND FROM LAURA'S KNUCKLES. 
PIERCE Laura! NO! NO!! 
ON LOGAN-- He reacts to the claws. In shock. Cannot believe what he's seeing. With the attention on Laura, Logan starts moving, limping, back to the limo. His eyes meet-- 
Laura's. A moment of mutual recognition. It breaks as she turns to face the Federales. 
ON CHARLES-- who, struggling against the meds, presses himself against the glass, staring at Laura. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 36. 
CHARLES ...My Lord. 
BACK TO LAURA AS -- THE FEDERALES LUNGE AT HER and, sadly for them, Laura leaps in the air and becomes a whirling dervish of death. Limbs and weapons sliced from her attackers like a topiary. Guns fire to no effect as Laura evades the shots. 
This little girl has been created, designed and trained for one thing and one thing only: killing. And she's a virtuoso. 
This wave dispatched, LAURA FLEES, HIDES BEHIND THE CATWALK SUPPORTS. The armed Federales hunt for her among the supports and she starts picking them off, one by one, with her blades and even with their own guns.

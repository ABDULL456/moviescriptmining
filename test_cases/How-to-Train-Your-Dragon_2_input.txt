VIKING #2 One length to your stern. 
VIKING #3 On your starboard flank. 
VIKING #4 Three widths to port. 
VIKING #5 Ahead, at your bow. 
VIKING #6 Haven't a clue. ON STOICK straining into the fog as the calls continue. Massive, jagged sea stacks begin to emerge, threatening to rip the ships to shreds. Gobber approaches him, speaking under his breath. 
GOBBER Listen... Stoick... I was overhearing some of the men just now and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here -- not me of course, I know you're always the man with the plan -- but some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all, what it might be? 
STOICK Find the nest and take it. 
GOBBER Ah. Of course. Send them running. The old Viking fall-back. Nice and simple. 
STOICK Shhh. Stoick notices that Toothless' ear plates are at the alert, quietly reacting to inaudible sounds. Stoick crosses to the stern of the ship and grabs the tiller, moving the helmsman out of the way. 
STOICK (CONT'D) Step aside. Stoick pulls the ship into a turn, covertly following Toothless' head movements. 
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 83. The ship barely misses a jagged outcrop that suddenly appears out of the soupy fog. 
VIKING Bear to port. The order is called out from ship to ship. CRUNCH! The bow barely makes it past another sea stack. Stoick continues to follow Toothless' cues, undeterred. 
EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY 
Hiccup raises the bolt on the Monstrous Nightmare's pen. 
FISHLEGS (O.S.) If you're planning on getting eaten, I'd definitely go with the Gronckle. Hiccup turns to see his fellow recruits, watching him with folded arms. Tuffnut steps forward with a scowl. 
TUFFNUT You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon. 
(BEAT) It's me. 
HICCUP Uh... 
SNOTLOUT I love this plan. 
HICCUP I didn't... 
RUFFNUT You're crazy. 
(SULTRY) I like that. 
ASTRID So? What is the plan? Hiccup smiles, glowing in the support of his friends. 
EXT. FOGGY SEA - DAY 
The ships follow in line through the gauntlet of rocks as orders are whispered from ship to ship. 
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 84. A dragon head looms out of the fog. The men recoil... only to discover that it's a wrecked ship, impaled high on a gnarled sea stack. 
GOBBER Ah. I was wondering where that went. A clicking buzz becomes audible, growing louder. It fills the sky, converging in one general direction. Stoick sniffs the air. 
STOICK Stay low and ready your weapons. Stoick's ship suddenly JERKS to a halt as the keel burrows into shallow black sand. Stoick hops overboard, landing on a sprawling beach. The BUZZING suddenly STOPS. Above him, a craggy volcano towers into the gloom. 
STOICK (CONT'D) We're here. Behind him, several dragon-headed bows pierce the fog.

PETE (frustrated) What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one? 
LEO They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know. 
PETE Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes! 
LEO Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix. 
PETE I was decorated. 
LEO I know.  A Purple Heart. 
PETE Exactly. 
LEO You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk. 
PETE At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career! 
LEO You can't testify. 
PETE Why not? 
Leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket, offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself. 
LEO Don't take this personally, kid. If it were up to me, I'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible.  What can I say?  I like you. 
Leo lights Pete's cigarette and his own.  Puts a fatherly hand on his shoulder. 
LEO They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all. 
PETE (under his breath) Yeah, well, that's enough. 
LEO Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um... 
PETE "Ashes To Ashes?" 
LEO That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen. 
PETE So, it is a blacklist. 
LEO (defensive) Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist. (calm) Now, are you gonna play ball? 
PETE (sullenly) Yes. (then, pissed) Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair! 
Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke. 
LEO (hand on Pete's shoulder) Kid, this is the United States Government we're talkin' about. Fair ain't the point. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  WRITER'S BUILDING/PETE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Prominent on the wall is a framed "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" poster.  Pete reaches up and takes it down.  He leans it up against the desk, then sits heavily in the wooden swivel chair.  He swivels around to see 
A STUDIO SECURITY GUARD 
standing by the door.  He's watching Pete's every move. 
Two boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete's belongings.  Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk drawer.  He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the desk.  He looks at the cover of the first one: 
"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" By Peter Appleton A United Pictures Production February 19, 1951 
Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the second one: 
"ASHES TO ASHES" By Peter Appleton 
He jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box, which contains somewhat more personal items.  A ragged gold pillow with tassels.  Legal pads of notes.  An old tin-toy fire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn.  He turns it around in his hands. 
PETE (musing) Huh.  Red... 
Footsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door. 
SANDRA (O.S.) Pete?  Pete...? 
Sandra appears in the doorway.  She's in costume -- a Louis XIV courtier.  She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and embraces him. 
SANDRA Oh, Pete... 
They kiss.  The Guard watches their every move. 
SANDRA What happened? 
PETE What exactly did you hear? 
SANDRA That you got let go. 
PETE I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in? 
SANDRA He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why? 
PETE Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching. 
SANDRA You mean, he was... let go, too? 
PETE (sotto, an appeal) They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help. 
During this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling away from Pete. 
PETE A lot of good people are being accused of things they didn't do. Hell, even if I was a communist, this is America, goddammit, a person should be able to be whatever they want to be!  Right?

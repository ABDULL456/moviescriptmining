Pulling up outside Ruthies house 
Ruthie: here it is, right here 
Benny; 2nd job huh/ 
Ruthie: yeah got to make those ends meet you know 
Benny: this is just how I imagined your place. Well 
Ruthie: you want to come in? Or you want to 
Benny: oh no Ill come in, for a minute. Whoa! What is this? Nice porch. 
Ruthie: pretty nice fish Joon gave you 
Benny: oh yeah, those fish. Yeah I was shocked I was Nice fish, I mean yeah 
Ruthie: I never had a fish 
Benny: what? Not even as a kid? 
Ruthie: no, under privileged childhood I guess 
Benny: down right un-American if you ask me 
Ruthie: yeah 
Benny: you can have one of mine if you want 
Ruthie: no I couldnt possibly. They were a gift 
Benny: but you know you could borrow it. But you know we could share it. Like joint custody. You could take it on the weekends you know. What is this?

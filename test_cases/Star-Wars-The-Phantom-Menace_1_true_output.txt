The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled with a series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots down the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several walls of deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the DARK LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from DARTH MAUL. The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor. OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open. QUI-GON sits and meditates. The SITH LORD tries to patch up his wounds. 
INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM 
A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the door to the throne roo. Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door. PADME turns around and sees TWO MORE appear at the far end of the hallway, trapping them in the middle. PADME throws down her pistol and turns to CAPTAIN PANAKA. 
PADME : Throw down your weapons. They win this round. CAPT. PANAKA : But we can't.... PADME : Captain, I said throw down your weapons. 
CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS MEN throw down their weapons. 
EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY 
A DESTROYER DROID blasts one of the shield generators, causing it to EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart.OOM-9 sees the shield weaken and orders his tanks forward. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals a retreat as the tanks enter the battle. The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR is blown off his KAADU and lands on one of the tank guns. A GUNGAN WARRIOR signals JAR JAR to jump off. JAR JAR is afraid. The gun swings around trying to knock JAR JAR off. JAR JAR hangs from the tank barrel as it moves along. Finally, he jumps onto a KAADU behind a GUNGAN WARRIOR. EXPLOSIONS from the tank fire are everywhere. It is chaos. 
INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECTRIC BEAM - HALLWAY 
The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating. The wall of the deadly rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUI-GON and the DARK LORD. When the wall between QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a split second fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. They move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole. The electron ray gates begin to close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides to a stop just before he hits the deadly electron field. QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated OBI-WAN watches. DARTH MAUL cathces QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and runs him through. QUI-GON slumps to the floor in a heap. 
EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY 
The GUNGANS have beeb overrun. Some flee into the hills, chased by BATTLE DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded into groups by BATTLE DROIDS and DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL are held in a small group with OTHER OFFICERS. 
JAR JAR : Dissa bad, berry bombad. GENERAL CEEL : Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen. 
INT. THED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY 
PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and SIX OTHER OFFICERS are brought by TEN BATTLE DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and FOUR NEIMOIDIAN COUNCIL MEMBERS. 
NUTE : Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty...and end this pointless debate in the Senate. 
SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with SEVERAL TROOPS. Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance. 
SABE : I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you've lost! 
NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN. NUTE yells at the TEN GUARDS in the room. 
NUTE : After her! This one is a decoy! 
SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE. NUTE turns to PADME. 
NUTE : (Cont'd) Your Queen will not get away with this. 
PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security button that opens a panel in her desk opposite CAPTAIN PANAKA. PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to CAPTAIN PANAKA and one to an OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS. The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits the switch to close the door. The OFFICER at the door jams the controls. CAPTAIN PANAKA throws more pistols to the OTHER GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and afraid. 
PADME : Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here. NUTE : Don't be absurd. There are too few of you. It won't be long before hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us. 
INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT 
OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the SITH LORD attacks him. The DARK LORD is relentless in his assault on the young JEDI. OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling objects at each other as they fight. DARTH MAUL seems to have the upper hand as OBI-WAN grows weary. DARTH MAUL catches OBI-WAN off guard, and the JEDI slips into a melting pit. He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH MAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the endless shaft. The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment, OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to hi, throwing DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH down. DARTH MAUL falls into the melting pit to his death. OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying. 
OBI-WAN : Master! Master! QUI-GON : It is too late...It's... OBI-WAN : No! QUI-GON : Obi-Wan promise...promise me you'll train the boy... OBI-WAN : Yes, Master... QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...he will...bring balance...train him! 
QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.

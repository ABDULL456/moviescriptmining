Sc 1                                                  Sc 1 ADA (VO - Scs 2 to 7) The voice you hear is not my speaking voice, but my mind's voice. 
I have not spoken since I was six years old. No one knows why, not even me. My father says it is a dark talent and the day I take it into my head to stop breathing will be my last. 
Today he married me to a man I've not yet met. Soon my daughter and I shall join him in his own country. My husband said my muteness does not bother him. He writes and hark this: God loves dumb creatures, so why not he! 
Were good he had God's patience for silence affects everyone in the end. The strange thing is I don't think myself silent, that is, because of my piano. I shall miss it on the journey.

A woman in a dark crepe Victorian dress sits leaning against a tree, her hands cover her face, around her neck she wears a writing pad. She crosses a field with large bare trees, in the far background stands a 3 storey stone house.

Sc 6     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE FLORA'S BEDROOM NIGHTSc 6

Sc 7     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMNIGHT     Sc 7 
The woman stands at a window lit by moonlight. Her skin appears luminescently white. She touches the wooden window frame, the curtain, the objects on the window sill, her mind abstracted, her hands unconsciously performing a farewell. Turning from the window she moves to a square piano crowded by packing boxes. In the dim light she begins to play strongly. Her face strains, she is utterly involved, unaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie accompaniment to the music. 
An old maid in night-dress looks in. Abruptly the woman stops playing. The emotion leaves her face, it whitens and seems solid like a wall.

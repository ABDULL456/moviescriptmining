DR. CHU I had just been talking to her in the Holding Room. She was perfectly fine. A little drowsy. I thought it was funny that when they brought her in, she was out cold. 
DR. MALLORY (shuffling around in aimless circles) Jesus H. Kee-rist! 
Mrs. Christie stares down at the face of the dead patient on the table, who has had her chest spread wide open so that the organs are exposed. 
MRS. CHRISTIE Well, we'll just all have to stay here until Mr. Mead or someone from the O.O.D. comes back. 
DR. MALLORY Well, I'm not taking the rap for this! I've already got one malpractice suit pending, and I'm not taking the rap for this one! 
HOLLY PAVILION, ROOM 
William Mead's bed is empty. The Reverend Drummond's suit, still on its hanger, is lying on it. Drummond himself lies comatose and rigged out with I.V.s and catheters. Barbara Drummond is packing her father's things into an open one- suiter valise. The door opens. She looks up. It's Bock. They look at each other -- two people in love. 
BOCK Look, you're not going. I love you, and I'm not going to let you go. 
He picks up the suit lying on the bed. 
BOCK Come on, let's start putting your father's things back. He's staying here. (hangs the suit in the closet) I'll find an apartment somewhere. I'm staying in a filthy little hotel room. We can't use that. 
His eyes are caught by a white doctor's uniform hanging in the armoire along with the suits and overcoats of the two patients in the room. He bends over to peer at the nameplate over the breast pocket. 
BARBARA I can't make it here, Herb. I'll crack up. I cracked up once already. One week here, and I'd be running naked through the streets screaming again. I can retain my sanity only in a simple society. 
BOCK For God's sake, Barbara, you can't seriously see me living in a grass shack hunting jackrabbits for dinner? Be sensible for God's sake. 
BARBARA I am being sensible. What is it you're so afraid of leaving here? Your plastic home? Your conditioned air? Your synthetic clothes? Your instant food? I'm offering you green silence and solitude, the natural order of things. Mostly, I'm offering me. I think we're beautiful, Herb. 
BOCK (utterly in love) You make it sound almost plausible. 
BARBARA I don't know why you even hesitate. What's holding you here? Is it your wife? 
BOCK No, that's all over. I suppose if I'm married to anything, it's this hospital. It's been my whole life. I just can't walk out on it as if it never mattered. I'm middle-class. Among us middle-class, love doesn't triumph over all. Responsibility does. 
BARBARA Herb, don't ask me to stay here with you, because I love you, and I will. And we'll both be destroyed. 
He turns to her again. They both look away. 
BARBARA I've got the bill here to pay yet. 
BOCK I'll come with you. 
She gathers her raincoat and goes. Bock follows her out into the... 
HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR 
...where Dr. Joseph Lagerman, Head of Nephrology, perhaps remembered from an earlier scene, has been waiting for Bock. He joins them en route to the elevators. 
LAGERMAN Herb, you asked me to find that dialysis nurse. 
BOCK What dialysis nurse? 
Barbara has continued walking. Bock starts to follow her. 
BARBARA I'll go pay the bill. 
LAGERMAN The one who goofed on your patient, Drummond. 
Bock turns back to Lagerman. 
LAGERMAN Well, her name is Theresa Campanella, but you are not going to believe this, Herb. She died on the operating table in O. R. Three about an hour ago.

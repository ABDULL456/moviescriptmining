TALIA There is no way to stop this bomb. Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at Batman.) My father's work is done. 
Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns - Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to attach a hoist from the Bat. 
GORDON What're you doing? 
BATMAN Two minutes. I can fly it out over the bay... 
Catwoman is at his side as he works. 
CATWOMAN Rig it out to fly over the water, then bail - 
BATMAN No autopilot. She takes this in. He stands to face her. 
CATWOMAN You could've gone anywhere. Been anything. But you came back here. 
BATMAN So did you. 
CATWOMAN I guess we're both suckers. She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves to the Bat, Gordon alongside. 
GORDON So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you don't come back? 
Batman opens the canopy. 
EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 
Blake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus. 
BLAKE Come on! On the bus! 
FATHER REILLY What're you doing? 
BLAKE Protection from the blast - 
FATHER REILLY It's an atom bomb -! 
Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious. 
BLAKE You think they need to hear that in their last seconds? You think I'm going to let them die without hope? 
EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 
Gordon puts a hand on Batman's arm. 
GORDON I never cared who you were - 
BATMAN And you were right. 
GORDON But shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them? 
BATMAN A hero can be anyone. That was always the point. 
Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon. Anyone. A man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended... The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers 
INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring, loving. Gordon looks up to the cockpit - 
GORDON Bruce Wayne? - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the tunnel mouth. 
The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but there's no power to get over it. 
EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 
Blake shouts into the bus - 
BLAKE Heads down! Heads down, now! 
FATHER REILLY Blake, they need to make their peace. Blake turns to him, furious. 
BLAKE They're children! They have no peace to make - An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across, startled, turns to the children on the bus. Get down! This is it! The smallest of the boys stares through the window past Blake. 
LITTLE BOY No. That's Batman! Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth of the river...the bay...the ocean... Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham... 
As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon. 
GORDON (V.O.) 'I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss...' Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river. 
GORDON (V.O.) 'I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy...' 
EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR - DAY 
Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is there, whose face we do not yet see... 
GORDON 'I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...' Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave. 'It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.' 
Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him... Alfred. Tears streaming. Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves. Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of Thomas and Martha Wayne. 
ALFRED I'm so sorry. I failed you. You trusted me, and I failed you. And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs. 
EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS 
Gordon nods at Lucius. Blake is at Gordon's side. 
GORDON Can I change your mind about quitting the force? 
BLAKE No. What you said about structures. About shackles. I can't take it. The injustice. (Gestures at gardens.) I mean...no one's ever going to know who saved an entire city. 
GORDON They know. (Off look.) It was Batman. 
EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY 
Gordon, on a platform with dignitaries, watches a statue being unveiled. The curtain parts: Batman, immortalized in granite. We move in on the stone face... 
VOICE (V.O.) Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to reflect his more modest estate... 
INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY 
The voice belongs to Wayne's lawyer, addressing a small group. 
LAWYER Nonetheless, there are considerable assets to dispose of... The contents of the house are to be

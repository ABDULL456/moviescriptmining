INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER An exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to a walk-in vault. 
The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of the vault. A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading the cart into the vault. 
INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY 
A train arrives.   People jostle on and off. One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser. Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap over his shoulder. The train doors begin to close.   When... A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed. Intense. Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the platform into the tunnel and disappear. 
INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the door, securing the vault. 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high- voltage third rail. Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him. Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him back up and away from the danger. FAIT Watch yourself. Miles nods. 
FAIT Keep it tight. Miles nods again, and they set off. 
INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY Sounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and scans the security monitors. 
ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man in the suit riding up. 
BACK TO SCENE Douglas settles back in with his magazine.

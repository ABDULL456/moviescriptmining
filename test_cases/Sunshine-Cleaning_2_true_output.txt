SHERM Nineteen Ninety-nine. 
JOE What's the play on that? 
SHERM Oh, that's the floor right there. I'm actually taking a loss on this to make room for some new product. 
ROSE Well, I could pay cash. 
SHERM Cash is good. 
Sherm walks around and unlocks the driver's side door. 
JOE (whispering to Rose) Ask him about the bumper. 
ROSE What? 
JOE The dented bumper. 
Rose approaches Sherm with a smile. 
ROSE I noticed the bumper's kind of banged up. 
Sherm smiles.

SHERM Character. 
JOE We were over at Motor Mart on Lomas earlier. They got a nice looking Chevy G series for eighteen. 
SHERM Power steering? 
Joe nods. 
Oscar crawls into the passenger seat for a closer look. He sees the CB mounted on the ceiling and tugs Norah's sleeve. 
OSCAR What's that? 
NORAH Oh, excellent. 
ROSE God, do people even use those anymore? 
OSCAR What is it? 
Sherm grabs the handset to demonstrate. 
SHERM It's a CB. You talk into this thing and hold this thing down and it turns your voice into radio waves and sends it into the heavens. 
OSCAR Heaven? 
Sherm tosses the keys to Rose.

SHERM Why don't you take it for a test drive. 
Rose, Norah and Oscar pile into the van. Joe hangs back with Sherm. 
77   EXT. STREET - DAY                                              77 
The Econo van rumbles by. 
GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        49. 
78   INT. VAN - DAY                                                       78 
Rose drives. Norah sits shotgun and sings the baseline to a 70s era porno. Oscar kneels between them staring at the CB. 
NORAH Bow-chicka-bow-bow. Can I drive? 
ROSE No. 
OSCAR Try the CB! 
Rose reaches up and clicks the CB on. Nothing but static. She adjusts the frequency dial until she lands on the faintest hint of a voice buried beneath the crush of static. 
Oscar's face lights up with amazement. Rose is under-whelmed. She clicks the CB off. 
ROSE Antenna's probably broke. 
Norah points out the window. 
NORAH Ice Cream Hut! 
79   EXT. ICE CREAM HUT - DAY                                             79 
Rose pays for three soft serve cones and makes her way to the picnic table where Norah and Oscar wait. 
Norah points to an `apartment for rent' sign on the building across the street. A big bosomed woman sits on the porch with a rabbit in her lap. 
NORAH How cool to live across from the Ice Cream Hut. 
Rose distributes the melty goods. 
ROSE You should rent it. Seriously, you're making money now. 
Norah assesses the building. The RABBIT LADY sees them staring. She waves. Rose and Norah turn around amused.

But Sidney doesn't take the paper back; he explains: 
SIDNEY A kid named Dallas, who runs a dinky jazz quintet. (he leans closer) He keeps company with J.J.'s screwball sister... 
ELWELL 
This does get a reaction, a flicker of genuine interest. Elwell reads the item for a second time. 
SIDNEY AND ELWELL 
Watching Elwell read, Sidney encourages: 
SIDNEY It's a real goody if, like me, you wanna clobber J.J.! 
Now Elwell lays the item down in front of him.  Clearly, he is considering it.  Sidney prompts again. 
SIDNEY He's got his TV tomorrow.  He'd read it just before rehearsals. 
Elwell nods.  But he is still reluctant. 
ELWELL (cautiously) Mmm.  Trouble is I can't think of any good reason why I should print anything you give me.  I can't even think of a bad reason. 
SIDNEY 
Sidney drops his eyes to the magazine once more.  He fingers it in a preoccupied but significant way. 
SIDNEY (gently) Suppose I introduce you to a lovely reason, Otis.  One that's good and bad...and available? 
ELWELL 
His eyes go from the magazine to Sidney; he gets the point alright. 
ELWELL I'm not an unreasonable man... 
Elwell reaches for the slip of paper once more. 
SIDNEY AND ELWELL 
In picking it up, Elwell clearly implies his readiness to accept the item - on conditions.  Sidney, in his turn, gets this point.  He turns towards the passing waiter. 
SIDNEY Waiter!  The check. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Rita is in the bedroom.  She appears to have some familiarity to the premises... She hears the doorbell.  She makes swift adjustment to her appearance and takes a swift gulp of a drink as she carries it through to answer the door. 
SIDNEY'S OFFICE 
The outer room is lit only by one of the lamps on the desk. Rita crosses and goes to the door.  Sidney's shadow can be seen through the frosted glass.  At the door, Rita opens it slowly and with a seductive manner. 
RITA (coyly) Hi! 
Sidney steps into the room.  Rita begins to close the door prior to stepping into his embrace.  Sidney puts one arm about her.  But now she reacts to... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Otis Elwell stands on the landing outside.  In most gentlemanly fashion, he takes off his hat. 
RITA 
This new arrival gets a dismal reaction from the girl. 
SIDNEY (unembarrassed) Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell. 
RITA (with no welcome whatsoever) Hello. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Elwell is not unaware of his cool reception.  He glances at Sidney as he comes into the room.  But his manner is suave. 
ELWELL Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis. 
SIDNEY Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what. (to Otis) Right, Otis? 
ELWELL Right! 
Elwell sits down on the sette, stretches his limbs, smiles at the girl.  Rita still says nothing.  Sidney mistakes her attitude for acquiescence.  He swallows his drink, sets it down. 
SIDNEY I thought you two could talk the whole thing over till I got back. 
Rita looks at him sharply. 
RITA Back? 
SIDNEY One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night. 
He grins at Rita.  She doesn't respond.  Turning, she goes swiftly through the door into the bedroom. 
RITA (sharply) Hold on.  You can drop me off on your way... 
Emphasizing the asperity in her voice, she closes the door behind her. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Elwell looks at Sidney; Sidney looks at Elwell.  Elwell gets up slowly from the settee. 
ELWELL (amused by acid) Consternation reigns... 
Sidney is uncomfortable, not sure how Elwell is taking the rejection.  Elwell glances at his wristwatch, lays down his drink. 
SIDNEY (quickly) Now, Otis... 
Elwell shrugs, remarks pleasantly but with significance: 
ELWELL I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment... 
SIDNEY Give me a chance -- 
He goes into the bedroom, closing the door after him. 
INT. BEDROOM 
Rita is in a flurry of indignation.  Sitting on the bed, she is fastening one high-heeled shoe.  Sidney stands glaring at her. 
SIDNEY Don't you know who that man is?

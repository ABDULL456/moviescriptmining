JONATHAN Hello? 
WYATT'S VOICE Hey, you're up early! 
JONATHAN Hi! How's London? 
WYATT'S VOICE Raining. So you've got mine-and I've.got yours? 
JONATHAN Yeah. Listen, last night...um...I met this- 
WYATT'S VOICE Damn! Sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, they want me in a meeting. Hey, no long distance calls, okay! Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan shakes his head, amused. He hails a cab, glances back at the hotel. His lips curl into a vaguely proud, if still dazed, smile. 
INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - DAY 
Jonathan sits alone at the long conference table, working but distracted. He pauses, eyes Wyatt's cell phone sitting there. 
INSERT - EXTREME CLOSE ON THE CELL PHONE'S DISPLAY WINDOW The numbers stored have no names associated with them. It's just a series of undesignated seven-digit sequences, a list of phone numbers that seems to go on and on. Jonathan clicks on a number at random. It highlights itself. Jonathan hesitates, then clicks again. The number is dialled. RING...RING - a woman with an elegant BRITISH ACCENT answers: 
BRITISH ACCENT                                                  (V.0.) Yes? 
JONATHAN Hello, um - I'm sorry to bother you                             - 
BRITISH ACCENT (V.O.) How did you get this number? 
JONATHAN Through a friend. 
BRITISH ACCENT                             (V.0.) I think you've got the wrong number. Now if you'll excuse me                                             - 
JONATHAN wait - Jonathan fumbles for what else to say before she hangs up. 
BRITISH ACCENT                                                  (V.O.) Yes? CLOSE ON JONATHAN. What to say? And then: 
JONATHAN (braces himself, swallows) Are you free tonight? He shuts his eyes, ready for a hang up. A long silence. 
BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.) I can be. Jonathan opens his eyes half in disbelief.

BRITISH ACCENT                                                 (V.0.) Where? 
JONATHAN Where. Right... The Plaza? 
BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.) I'm afraid that's a bit uptown for me. Perhaps the Mercer? Say by the Shakespeare, half past eleven? 
JONATHAN The Shakespeare? 
BRITISH ACCENT                                                 (V.0.) It should be fairly evident. 
INT. THE MERCER HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT 
The SoHo industrial motif is the antithesis of the Plaza. By a vintage book library we find a sleekly dressed YOUNG BLACK WOMAN perusing spines of Salinger, Scott, Sheherazade - 
JONATHAN                                                       (O.S.) Excuse me, um - I'm sorry to disturb you - She turns, regards him a moment, curiously - a copy of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in her hand. 
JONATHAN I'm - supposed to meet someone here and- 
BRITISH ACCENT You're rather new to this, aren't you? Jonathan falters. She smiles. 
BRITISH ACCENT That's okay. I like that. 
LOBBY ELEVATOR She enters first, then Jonathan. He waits for her.to push a button - only it seems she's waiting for him to do the same. 
JONATHAN I'm sorry, what floor? She rolls her eyes. 
BACK TO THE HOTEL LOBBY Jonathan and British Accent cross the lobby once more.

Noah takes his hand and leads him around the side of the rock.  He is mentally retarded, but he knows that something has changed this afternoon. 
At the meeting house, Lucius reads another note to the elders. 
Lucius:  Today at Resting Rock, Noah Percy handed Ivy Walker berries of the bad color.  When asked where he found these berries, for they were not like others I have seen, he pointed to the drawing upon resting rock. 
We see Lucius, Ivy, and Noah staring at the side of the rock (although Ivy does not see it).  There is a drawing of a strange, reddish-colored creature, with skeletons all around it. 
Lucius (off-screen):  It is my belief that Noah Percy has entered the woods, and has done so on many occasions.  It is also my belief that, because of his innocence, those creatures who reside in the woods did not harm him. 
Back in the meeting house, he continues to read.  The circle is in a slightly different order today, more mixed up, and facing a different direction. 
Lucius:  This strengthens my feeling that they will let me pass if they sense I am not a threat. 
Alice (off-screen, later in the day):  We shall speak of the town, just this once, and we shall never speak of it again. 
She sits, knitting yarn that is wound around Lucius's hands. 
Alice:  Your father left for the market on a Tuesday, at a quarter past nine in the morning.  He was found, robbed and naked, in the filthy river, two days later. 
Lucius begins to shake, and tears stream down his face. 
Lucius:  Why'd you tell me this blackness? 
Alice:  So you will know the nature of what you desire. 
Lucius:  I do not desire it.  (Angry) My intentions are true to my word. I think of NOTHING but the people of this village.

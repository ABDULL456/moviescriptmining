(wheeling) 
You can't take her away from here! 
GEORGE 
(confidently) 
Why not? 
CONWAY 
(strongly) 
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo. 
GEORGE 
(slowly) 
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"? 
CONWAY 
She came here in 1888! 
291. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
Favoring George. He laughs hollowly. He runs his hand through his hair. He stares unbelievingly at Conway. 
GEORGE 
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty! 
CONWAY 
You're wrong, George. 
GEORGE 
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway. 
(significantly) 
I found out a lot of things last night. 
(quickly) 
I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place. 
292. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
Conway stares at him. 
GEORGE 
(cynically) 
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving? 
(vehemently) 
It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me! 
CONWAY 
(doesn't want to believe it) 
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it! 
GEORGE 
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story! 
As he speaks he has crossed to door leading to adjoining room. Conway's eyes are glued on him. 
GEORGE 
Come in a minute. 
After a few seconds Maria appears in the doorway and stands there timidly. 
GEORGE 
Come in. 
She steps forward. 
293. MED. SHOT - THE THREE 
GEORGE 
(shrewdly) 
I've got some bad news for you, Maria. My brother and I have decided we can't take you along. 
Maria's face collapses. 
MARIA 
(small, frightened voice) 
You can't take me? 
She rushes to George and throws her arms around him. 
MARIA 
But you promised me! You promised to take me with you! 
Over her shoulder George looks victoriously at Conway, who cannot believe his ears. Suddenly Maria wheels on Conway. 
MARIA 
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone? 
CONWAY 
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La? 
MARIA 
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out! 
CONWAY 
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone. 
MARIA 
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years! 
CONWAY 
Father Perrault is dead. 
MARIA 
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him! 
(pleading) 
Oh George, you must take me with you! 
CONWAY 
(quietly) 
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you? 
MARIA 
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he? 
CONWAY 
Yes. 
MARIA 
I thought so! He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy. 
(pause) 
Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?

RODERICK (sternly) Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN I have acted as I think fit. 
RODERICK Sir, I'm a British officer. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up? 
RODERICK Neither! 
Springing at him like a tiger. 
But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard. He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off, and says, from the other end of the table where he stands dodging Roderick, as it were. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Advance a step, and I send this bullet into your brains! 
The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed with musket and bayonet to aid their captain. 
The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the wine, had removed his sword. 
RODERICK I volunteer. 
EXT.  A ROAD - DAY 
Prussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of them. 
Captain Galgenstein rides by. 
RODERICK (V.O.) At the close of the Seven Years' War, the Prussian army, so renowned for its disciplined valor, was officered and under-officered by native Prussians, it is true, but was composed for the most part of men hired or stolen, like myself, from almost every nation in Europe. The deserting to and fro was prodigious. 
EXT.  A FIELD - DAY 
Prussian punishment gauntlet. 
RODERICK (V.O.) The life the private soldier led was a frightful one to any but the men of iron courage and endurance.  The punishment was incessant. 
EXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY 
RODERICK (V.O.) I was not near so unhappy, in spite of all, as I had been on my first enlisting in Ireland.  At least, there will be no one of my acquaintance who will witness my shame, and that is the point which I have always cared for most. 
Rape, pillage and burn. 
Brief thematic repeat of British army version. 
RODERICK (V.O.) I reasoned with myself thus:  "Now you are caught, there is no use in repining -- make the best of your situation, and get all the pleasure you can out of it.  There are a thousand opportunities of plunder, offered to the soldier in war time, out of which he can get both pleasure and profit; make use of these, and be happy." 
EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT 
Prussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons. 
Roderick fighting. 
RODERICK (V.O.) I do not intend to make a history of battles in the Prussian any more than in the English service.  I did my duty in them as well as another, and there was not a braver, cleverer, handsomer, and, I must own, wickeder soldier in the Prussian army. 
EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY 
RODERICK I had formed myself to the condition of the proper fighting beast; on a day of action, I was savage and happy. 
Roderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life. 
EXT.  FIELD - DAY 
Roderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in saving Captain Galgenstein. 
Colonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of the regiment. 
COLONEL BULOW You are a gallant soldier, and have evidently come of good stock; but you are idle, dissolute, and unprincipled; you have done a deal of harm to the men; and, for all your talents and bravery, I am sure you will come to no good. 
RODERICK I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken regarding my character.  I have fallen into bad company, it is true; but I have only done as other soldiers have done; and, above all, I have never had a kind friend and protector before, to whom I might show that I was worthy of better things.  The Colonel may say I am a ruined lad, and send me to the devil; but be sure of this, I would go to the devil to serve the regiment. 
Captain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's performance. 
BERLIN - 1763 
RODERICK (V.O.) Soon after the war ended, our regiment was garrisoned in the capital, the least dull, perhaps, of all the towns of Prussia; but that does not say much for its gaiety.

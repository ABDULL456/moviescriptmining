ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam is somehow sitting up, wide awake -- looking at Deirdre with a penetrating glance. 
DEIRDRE Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again. 
SAM You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre. 
DEIRDRE (almost surprised by this) I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a - (almost with a sneer) Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed. (a quick beat) Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him." (a quick beat) But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less. 
SAM You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me. 
DEIRDRE Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me. 
Somewhere in all of this Deirdre has sat back down on the bed, and somehow now she's only inches away from Sam. They're lips brush and - 
A MUTED PHONE RINGS in a nearby room, breaking the moment.  A QUICK BEAT, then - 
DEIRDRE I better be getting that. 
SAM Duty calls? 
DEIRDRE (with a trace of a sigh) Just business. 
Deirdre gives Sam a light kiss on the lips and then she opens his door.  The muted phone is a little louder now.  Deirdre closes Sam's door as she exits, but - Sam reaches out a hand and catches the door right before it snaps shut.  He watches THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and opens the door to her room, and now the phone rings loudly until the door shuts, muting the sound once again, shutting Sam out.  The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go to - BLACK.  Just for a second.  And then - BLINDING SUN hits us in the eyes as we find ourselves above - 
EXT. NICE - DAY 
A DAZZLING OVERHEAD MOVING SHOT, establishing that we've changed locales, moved to a place filled with sun and blue water and reflective surfaces: the Cote d'Azure.  We start to MOVE DOWN TOWARDS - 
EXT. A PRIVATE BEACH - NICE - MEANWHILE 
A TOPLESS GRANDMA reclines on a beach chair, soaking up rays, sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a WAITER. Nearby - 
AT A ROUND TABLE - 
A nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in, we find our group: Deirdre, Sam, Vincent, Gregor, Swede, and Larry.  Food and drink surround them.  Larry is, of couse, still eating. 
DEIRDRE Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? (to Gregor) What's your job? 
GREGOR I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you. 
DEIRDRE (to Larry) Next. 
LARRY (a sigh, he's done this too many times) You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road. 
DEIRDRE (to Swede) Which leads us to... 
SWEDE I ride with fat-boy... 
LARRY (under his breath) Eat shit and die slowly... 
SWEDE After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard. 
LARRY I blast the lead car into oblivion... 
VINCENT (picking up) While Sam and I take out the back two cars... 
DEIRDRE Leaving... 
SWEDE (picking it up) ...Leaving me to step in, drop the target in the back seat, and get the package... 
DEIRDRE (with a quick look at Sam) While... 
SAM (returning her look) ...While I back him up, making sure to get the package if something goes wrong and somebody takes Swede down. 
Nobody else seems to notice this look between them, but we should -- if only to note that there's something about the way Deirdre queries Sam about his role, and something about the way Sam answers her without overly reacting -- they're not flirting, but there's a kind of acknowledgment of the history they now have between them.  But -- nobody else notices, and Swede's line follows Sam's without breaking the flow of the dialogue. 
SWEDE Nobody's taking me anywhere...

BUD What do you know? See an ordinary person spend his life avoiding tense situations. Repoman spends his life getting into tense situations. ! Lets go get a drink. 
Otto and Bud in a store 
Bud sets 2 six packs of "drink" down on the counter. 
BUD Tense situations kid. Get into five or six of them a day and it don't mean shit (zilch) anymore. I mean I seen men stabbed and it didn't mean shit (zilch). I've seen guns. Guns too they don't mean shit (zilch) but that's when you got to watch your self. Here I'll handle it pal. Uh settle down. 
BUD Have a nice day. Or night. Night, day, it doesn't mean shit (zilch). 
Duke, Archie, and Debbi rise from behind counter as Otto and Bud leave. 
DUKE Wasn't that Otto? 
DEBBI Otto who? 
DUKE You gotta watch yourself. (takes off mask) Have a nice day . . . night. 
Parnell drives Malibu across bridge 
Otto and Bud in front of house with tow truck 
BUD This is what I call phase 2 ace. If the dealer don't have the keys, you call the truck. And it is a heartbreak to be sitting waiting for the truck and the giblet comes out and drives it away. Once you've got this baby on the hooks, she's all ours. 
Man comes out of house with shaving cream on face. 
PAKMAN Oh no you don't. I'm nipping this in the bud right now. You are not going to take this car. I know my rights. There is absolutely no way you're going to take it. 
BUD Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman? 
PAKMAN Obviously not. I'm Arthur Pakman. Luann is my daughter. Now you're going to have to take this matter up with her. 
BUD Well don't think I haven't tried, sir, but she hasn't had the decency to call us in months. I mean, I've skipped trace this car all over town. 
PAKMAN Well, uh, Luann is sick. Now the damn car isn't working anyway, and I know, I know that's why she hasn't paid you. 
BUD Well, she could have called us? Look, all you've go to do is call my branch manager, I will abide with whatever he says. 
Bud hands Pakman a business card. 
PAKMAN READING CARD I. G. Farben. . . What do you take me for, a moron? If I go in there, you're going to take this car away. 
BUD What, and lose my job? The law requires that I stay right here until you call my branch manager. 
PAKMAN That's the law? 
BUD That's the law.

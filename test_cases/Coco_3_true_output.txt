CUT TO: 
INT. NEARBY CORRIDOR 
Miguel and Dante hide from the patrolman.     But Dante wanders off to inspect a side room. 
MIGUEL No, no -- Dante! 
INT. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS 
Miguel catches up to Dante.      He overhears an exchange in a nearby cubicle. 
CORRECTIONS OFFICER ...disturbing the peace, fleeing an officer, falsifying a unibrow... 
HÉCTOR That's illegal? 
CORRECTIONS OFFICER VERY illegal. You need to clean up your act, amigo. 
HÉCTOR Amigo? (verklempt) Oh, that's so nice, to hear you say that, because... (misty) I've just had a really hard Día de Muertos, and I could really use an amigo right now. 
Héctor leans gratefully toward the officer, overwhelmed with mock emotion. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) And amigos, they help their amigos. Listen, you get me across that bridge tonight and I'll make it worth your while. 
Héctor spies a de la Cruz poster at the officer's workstation. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) Oh, you like de la Cruz? He and I go way back! I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular Show! 
Miguel perks at the mention of de la Cruz. 
CORRECTIONS OFFICER Uh-- 
HÉCTOR I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you can meet him! (beat) You just gotta let me cross that bridge! 
The corrections officer pulls away. 
CORRECTIONS OFFICER I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday... (beat) But my shift's almost up, and I wanna visit my living family... so I'm letting you off with a warning. 
HÉCTOR Can I at least get my costume back? 
CORRECTIONS OFFICER Uh, no. 
In a huff, Héctor marches out of the room. 
HÉCTOR Some amigo... 
Miguel follows him. 
INT. HALLWAY 
MIGUEL Hey. Hey!     You really know de la Cruz? 
HÉCTOR Who wants to-- (noticing Miguel) Ah! You're alive! 
MIGUEL Shhh! 
CUT INTO: 
INT. PHONEBOOTH 
Miguel pulls Héctor into a phone booth to avoid suspicion. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) Yeah I'm alive. And if I wanna get back to the Land of the Living, I need de la Cruz's blessing. 
HÉCTOR That's weirdly specific. 
MIGUEL He's my great-great-grandfather. 
HÉCTOR He's your wha-whaat...? 
Hector's eyes drop into his mouth. He pops them back up with a punch to his jaw. Miguel is a little grossed out. 
Héctor turns to conference with himself. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait... (gasp) Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait? (beat) Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living?! 
MIGUEL D'ya know what, maybe this isn't such a g-- 
Héctor snaps his fingers rapidly, pistons firing. 
HÉCTOR No, niño, niño, niño, I can help you! You can help me. We can help each other! But most importantly, you can help ME. 
Miguel suddenly spies his family hurrying down a staircase. Mamá Imelda spots Miguel. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Miguel! 
MIGUEL AH! 
Héctor extends his hand. 
HÉCTOR I'm Héctor. 
MIGUEL That's nice! 
Miguel grabs Héctor by the wrist and drags him to the exit, away from his family.

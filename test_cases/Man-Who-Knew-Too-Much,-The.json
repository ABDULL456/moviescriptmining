BUS - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nMr. and Mrs. Ben McKenna at the back of a motor coach with their seven year old son, HANK. We do not see much of the background which is receding from us.

Sounds like a drink. \nBen runs his tongue across his lips. \nBEN You bet it does. \nINT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT \nThe bus rolls on past the Arab village into the open desert once again. It looks parched and grim. \nINT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nTired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank grows, restless. He looks about for something to do. Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes. Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the bus and test its possibilities for adventure. \nThe CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger. In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman. Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face. \nINT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nThe startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her face with her hands and gives a sharp cry, \nINT.

BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT \nThe woman still covers her face, but from the seat next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank, repeating his demand. \nINT.

And while we were in Europe, I thought I'd like to see Morocco again. \nHANK Daddy liberated Africa. \nLouis laughs a little.   Ben seems uncomfortable. \nBEN I was up around Casablanca with an Army field hospital, that's all. \nINT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nJo his been listening.   She seems annoyed at Louis Bernard's questioning.   She interrupts. \nJO Do you live in Morocco, Mr. Bernard? \nINT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nHe smiles at her. \nLOUIS Oh no.

We tried everything to got rid of them. We never thought of a Frenchman. \nEven Jo has to laugh at this, and as the bus continues on into Marrakesh, the three see to be fairly good friends brought together by the artless charm of a little boy. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 10. \nEXT.

It swings in toward the bus stop. \nEXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT \nThe bus pulls up to a stop, the door opens, and the passengers begin to file out. The McKennas, together with Louis Bernard, are the last off the bus. Arab helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus, to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to take the people to their various destinations in the city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs. \nEXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nHank rubs his backside a little. \nHANK Next time take the train. \nBEN (To Louis) Would you like to share our taxi to the hotel? \nLOUIS That's kind of you, doctor, but unfortunately I have some business first. \nJo tries to be casual. \nJO What business are you in, Mr. Bernard? \nBut he has turned his head and speaks something in Arabic to a porter, who begins to gather the McKenna's bags, and one belonging to Louis. Louis turns to Ben. \nLOUIS However, I'll be there later - perhaps we might have a drink together. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  11. \nBEN All right. But I'll serve the drinks in our suite. \nLOUIS In that case, I will take you to dinner. \nBEN No.   Now that's not a fair bargain. \nLOUIS But I know Marrakesh. I can show you an intriguing Arab restaurant where the food is different, and the manner of eating exotic. \nBEN (Gives in) Well -- that's what we came here for. Okay, Jo? Simple one of those Arabian Nights? \nBen takes her arm, in a warm gesture. \nJO (Smiles agreeably) Okay, But I'm no Scheherazade. \nBEN You'll do. \nLOUIS How would you prefer to travel to the hotel? By taxi? Fiacre? \nA moderately well-dressed, middle-aged couple emerge from the hotel. The man is dressed in a dark grey flannel suit.

THE CAMERA PANS BACK to the couple   left standing outside. The woman is still looking   after Jo McKenna. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  16. \nINT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT \nIt is now evening, and we are in the double bedroom and single bedroom of the McKennas in the Hotel Mamounia. We are able to see through into the single room where Hank is, brushing his teeth while his mother supervises his getting ready for bed. Jo is already dressed for the evening in a smart-looking outfit. Ben is by the chest of drawers and mirror. He just lust finished putting on his shirt. \nAt the far end of the room there is a   balcony over- looking the hotel gardens. By a small    table stands Louis Bernard dressed with unobtrusive   good taste. He is looking into the garden beyond. On    the table are glasses and a shaker of martinis. \nINT.

He's quite professional. Then he stops, takes a pose, and begins singing in a small, but not untalented voice. \nHANK When I was lust a little boy I asked my mother \"What will I be?\" Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? Here's what she said to me: \nJo takes up the song. Her voice is obviously professional, but beyond that, quite beautiful. \nJO Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera What will be will be Que Sera Sera. \nINT.

MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED.

Hank whistles a harmony accompaniment to the next verse. \nJO Now I have children of my own They ask their mother \"What will I be?\" Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? I tell them tenderly: \nThey sing the chorus in harmony together. \nHANK AND JO Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera! What will be will be Que Sera Sera! \nJust before they finish the song, there is a loud knocking at the outside door. The song trails off. \nHANK (Disgusted) There goes our sock finish! \nINT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT \nBen goes to the door, tightening his tie on the way. He opens it. A waiter is there with a tray of food. \nWAITER Dinaire for thee boy. \nBEN (Pointing) Right in there. \nThe waiter heads for the single bedroom, as the CAMERA PANS Ben back to the dresser. \nLOUIS I can't tell you how beautifully your wife sings. \nBEN Yeah.   She is pretty good. \nLOUIS She's marvelous. Too bad it was interrupted. \nBen pauses in dressing, speaks almost to himself. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                19. \nBEN I've had the same feeling.

FULL SHOT \nThe CAMERA is slowly MOVING around the interior of an Arab restaurant catering to European tourists. It has a Moorish atmosphere, and the diners are sitting on cushions or low sofas. Long-robed waiters are padding in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen. The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes. Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in the background. The light is supplied principally from candles. \nAs the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 23. \nA headwaiter, wearing a fez, comes forward. \nINT.

Jo glances at the diners, and then a look of surprise starts through her face. \nINT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThey are passing a couple who are seated on cushions eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner. \nINT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe headwaiter shows them to their seats -- two cushions directly behind those of the two people who stared at them. \nHEADWAITER I think you will find this comfortable. \nHe bows and departs. Jo seems disturbed, looks around as if trying to find another seat. \nJO Ben... \nBEN Sit down, Jo, please.   People are staring at us. \nShe sits on the far cushion. Her movements are graceful and easy as she sits tailor fashion. Ben, being tall and somewhat awkward, has trouble. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 24. \nFirst he kneels, and then with much struggle manages to fold his long legs underneath him. \nINT.

She leans close to him. \nJO You're right. People are staring at us. \nBEN What people? \nShe gives a quiet, warning nod toward the two people sitting behind them. Ben cranes his head around, but all he can see Is the back of a woman's head. He turns back. \nJO They stared at us when we went into the hotel. \nBEN Jo, will you stop imagining things? \nINT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nBen looks at her, then slowly turns his head to look behind him at the couple. As he does, the woman behind him also turns. They are staring directly at each other. \nMRS. DRAYTON Good evening. \nHearing her voice, Jo turns, looks, and so does the man with Mrs. Drayton. The woman then turns half way around toward Jo. \nMRS. DRAYTON You must think me awfully rude. I've been staring at you ever since I saw you at the hotel. \nJo slides a glance of \"see\" at Ben. \nMRS. DRAYTON (She peers at Jo) You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway? \nJo visibly relaxes and becomes Jo Conway. It's Ben's turn to give her a triumphant look in return. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             25. \nJO Yes, I am. \nMrs. Drayton turns to the man next to her. \nMRS.

The Arab gasps out something in French. \nLOUIS Ils ont trouv\u00e9s... ils ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 trouver... \nBen looks at him puzzled. \nLOUIS (English) McKenna... I'm... Louis.... Bernard. \nBen is quite surprised. \nEXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nBen glances swiftly at the fallen knife, and then reaches across Louis Bernard to turn him over and examine his wound. But the Frenchman reaches up with one arm and grabs Ben by the coat. \nLOUIS McKenna -- listen to me -- first! \nWith what strength he has, Louis drags Ben down until Ben's ear is near to his mouth. With a great effort Louis whispers to him. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                   41. \nEXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nA big closeup of Ben's ear and Louis' mouth enables us to hear the whispering, but Louis' voice is fading so much that we cannot distinguish the words -- at least enough to make any sense out of what he says. \nLOUIS A man...a statesman...is to be killed...assassinated...in London...soon...very soon...tell them...in London...to try Ambrose Chappell... \nPresently, the mouth stops speaking.    It remains still and open. \nEXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nAs Ben backs away, we see the staring eyes, and open mouth of Louis. Ben quickly puts his hand inside the robes to feel for Louis' heart, The hand slowly withdraws. Ben rises. \nEXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT \nThe Arabs crowd in to see the details. Louis Bernard, the McKennas and the Draytons are in the center of a large flat cement section of the market place. The Police by now have caught up to the event, and dash quickly into the picture toward Ben and Louis. Instinctively Ben backs away, as do the Draytons, and Jo and Hank. However, Ben still stays closer than the rest. One of the police picks up the knife and examines it, another bends down to wipe the make-up off Louis Bernard's face. Ben looks around for his wife. \nEXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nBen beckons to his wife beyond him, to join him. Jo turns Hank over to Mrs. Drayton. Hank stands close to the English woman as Jo comes over. As Jo comes up to Ben, he is feeling in his pocket for something. Takes out a pen. \nJO Ben -- who is he? \nBEN Louis Bernard. Got something to write on? \nShe begins looking in her purse. \nJO Is he dead? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 42. \nBEN (Impatiently) Yes. Yes. He's dead. \nShe   produces a small address book. Ben snatches it out   of her hand unceremoniously. He opens the book end   begins writing something down fast. Jo watches him   with mystified curiosity. \nEXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT \nDrayton strolls up, out of curiosity. He has also seen Ben's hurried writing, but Ben casually puts the notebook back into his inside pocket, along with the pen. Before either man can comment on the writing, the voice of a policeman is heard, speaking in French. \nPOLICE ONE Savez vous qui est cet homme? \nThe uniformed French policeman approaches Ben. \nEXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nThe policeman repeats his question as he stops in front of Ben. \nJo turns around at the sound of the door opening, and Ben and Drayton start to rise from the bench. \nThe policeman steps aside, holding the door, as a Police Inspector comes out of the office from behind him. He is a short, heavy-built-dark man. He does not smile. \nINT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe Inspector walks a few steps into the corridor, stops. Ben, Jo and Drayton approach him. Drayton speaks first. \nDRAYTON Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne parlent pas francais et ils m'ont demand\u00e9 de traduire. \nThe Inspector answers in English. \nINSPECTOR Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a translator will not be necessary. (To McKenna) Won't you come inside, Monsieur, Madame? \nHe stops aside, and wait. \nINSPECTOR (To Drayton) Do to the kindness to wait. I might have questions for you later. \nHe motions to the McKennas. Jo goes past him first, into the office, followed by Ben, Drayton returns to the bench, and watches the trio as the office door closes on them. \nINT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED.

Ben and Jo sit down. The Inspector looks at some papers on his desk, then holds out his hand. \nINSPECTOR (Precisely) Your passports, please. \nBen looks at Jo, who fishes for them in her purse. She takes them out, hands them to Ben, who hands them to the Inspector. He scrutinizes them. Uncomfortable, Ben retreats to a chair and sits down, waiting. The inspector checks the pictures against the people he sees sitting in his office, then puts the passports down on his desk. \nINSPECTOR You entered French Morocco four days ago. \nBEN That's right. \nINSPECTOR You are a doctor, monsieur? \nBEN A surgeon.    A tourist, and an American citizen. \nINSPECTOR Three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with Louis Bernard. \nBEN I didn't have. \nINSPECTOR You were recently in Paris? \nBEN A medical convention. \nINSPECTOR You come to   Marrakesh with him in the same bus.    You drank an ap\u00e9ritif with him in your   hotel room. And you ate at the same   restaurant last night. \nJO But at different tables. \nThe Inspector's eyes study her briefly, as if her comment was an unnecessary interruption. Then his eyes return to Ben. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               48. \nINSPECTOR So, Louis Bernard is a stranger to you? \nBEN I met him yesterday -- on the bus -- for the first time in my life. \nThe Inspector begins to let his skepticism be seen. \nINSPECTOR (ironically) And yet -- out of five  thousand people -- In a great market place  -- he comes to you when he is about to  die! Is that the action of a casual  acquaintance, monsieur? \nBEN (Obstinate) I know nothing about Louis Bernard. \nINSPECTOR No? Not even, I suppose, that he was an agent of the D\u00e9uxieme Bureau? \nBEN What's that? \nINSPECTOR Perhaps you have also never head of the American F.B.I.? (Sadly) It would be so much more easy for both of us, monsieur, if you would cease to pretend. \nBEN Now, look here... \nINSPECTOR (Patiently) The dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover. That is why he was kill-ed. He told you what he had discovered. Why? Because he placed complete confidence in you. Voila. \nBEN Boy, you not only ask the questions you also answer them -- Wait a minute let me ask you a question. \nINSPECTOR Indeed, Monsieur? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 49. \nBEN Assuming Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, I would never reveal anything he said to me, would I? \nINSPECTOR Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes find it desirable to betray a confidence? \nBEN Let's get something straight. I'm a tourist traveling for pleasure. I somehow got involved in an unfortunate incident. I came down here to make a simple statement of fact, and not to be subjected to a police grilling. \nINSPECTOR Monsieur, I would like.... \nBEN (Interrupting) Now hold your horses!   Just hold them. \nThe door opens suddenly.   The two men look up. \nINT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nA policeman opens the door and leans in. \nPOLICE TWO Inspecteur.

A telephone call for me? \nThe policeman at the door looks at the Inspector briefly. The Inspector is disconcerted, but doesn't tell the man what to say, so he turns back to Ben and nods. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                   50. \nBEN Where? \nThe policeman points over his shoulder to in outside office. \nINSPECTOR (To the world in general) Mais enfin, voyons! \nBEN I'll take the call now.    You just take it easy. \nHe goes out the door, closing it behind him. The Inspector sits down heavily. Then he looks up at Jo. \nBEN That phone call I received at the police station. \nShe nods dumbly. \nBEN It wasn't from the concierge at the hotel. It was from somebody with a foreign voice who said if I told anybody one word of what. Louis Bernard whispered to me in the market place that something...something might happen to...to, to Hank. \nShe comes suddenly as awake as she can. \nJO Hank?    Why H... ? \nBEN They've taken him away. \nShe pushes herself to her feet. She is fighting the drug successfully. She almost shouts at him. \nJO Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the hotel. She is downstairs! \nHe stands up. \nBEN Mrs. Drayton has vanished! She never came back here! And Hank didn't either! \nJO Well let's start looking for him.

I could kill you!   Sedative! \nHe reaches for her again.    She hits him away. \nJO All this time you, knew Hank was gone, and you wouldn't tell me. \nBEN I wasn't sure, until now. \nShe is fighting the drug which is beginning to take over again. \nJO He's my child more than yours!    I had him. \nHe takes hold of her again. She struggles fiercely, trying to get away, to hit him, kick him. \nJO Let go of me! I'll never never never forget this! We've got to find Hank! We've got to find him. \nHe struggles silently with her, trying to push her down on the bed, and hold her until the drug does its work. \nJO You think you're the only one strong enough to take anything? Ben, Ben, I hate you, with my whole heart. (She starts to cry) Hank! Where is Hank? Hank, oh Hank! Get him, Ben. Please. You damn miserable human...how could anybody...do... \nINT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nHe has forced her down on   the bed, pinioning her arms, even though her legs still   struggle somewhat. She is having a hard time seeing,   or talking.

Her arm relax somewhat. She is still straining to move her head, and talk, but all that comes out are unintelligible sounds and a half moan of anguish. Then she's gone. Ben looks at her a moment, relaxes his grip. He lowers his head down against hers. He seem to be fighting the desire to cry. He finally gains control of himself. He lifts his head slightly, gives her a soft and heartfelt kiss on the cheek. \nBEN (Softly) Darling, if somebody did this to me, I'd say just what you said. \nINT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE MOT \nBen stands up. The weight of unhappiness is heavy on him. He gets a blanket from the foot of the bed and covers her up.

The call is taken up by another voice somewhere in the city, and then another, and still another -- until the prayer is a continuous round of chanting starting close, moving away, almost fading, and then returning. \nINT.

The McKennas stand a moment, wondering what do. \nBUCHANAN Do sit down, won't you? \nJo hesitates, then sits down.    Ben doesn't. \nBEN Why does Scotland Yard want to talk with us? \nBuchanan sits down behind the desk.

A good agent keeps on staking his life. He doesn't always win. \nBen and Jo watch Buchanan carefully. \nBUCHANAN Bernard reckoned you were a man to trust. He relied on you, to come to us. \nJo looks at Ben.   He thinks a moment, but says nothing. \nBUCHANAN Those people kidnapped your boy -- in order to keep your mouth shut. That's right, isn't it? \nBEN I think they took him for money. \nBUCHANAN Then why didn't you go straight to your Consulate in Casablanca? Why did you come to London? \nBen is silent.

He takes out a handkerchief, hands it to her. She covers her face for a moment, then dries her tears. She looks up at Ben. \nJO He was scared. \nShe starts sobbing soundlessly again, her body shaking. Ben takes her in his arms to quiet her. She quiets down slowly.

A silent, but furious struggle ensues. It is now a complete melee between the four men and Ben as they try to hold him down. \nCHAPPELL JR. Hold him...hold him...till the police come. \nBen breaks loose temporarily, trying to find another escape. He realizes that the time for talking is past. But as fast as he is, the men are on him again. They twist and struggle through the stuffed and mounted animals. There is a melange of lion heads, swordfish, and other partially completed jobs. Sometimes, Ben in his struggles comes face to face with the angry head of a bared-teeth lion. Ambrose Chappell Jr. himself at one point finds the swordfish a very painful object somewhere about his anatomy. Ben eventually wrenches himself free. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 95. \nINT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nShooting toward the doorway. The confusion  gives him a free moment. He makes the door, twists it  open, and dashes out into the yard. Suddenly he turns  back and dashes in again. The man retreat in fear.   Ben picks up his fallen hat and dashes out again. \nINT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe five persons in the McKenna suits are sitting around. All but Jo have drinks in their hands. She seems to be absorbed in her own thoughts, but Val Parnell is holding forth, oblivious at first to her disinterest. \nVAL ...and back at our flat, after the first night, Chris had the nerve to suggest that the sketch where Bud Flanagan comes in dressed up as the Countess was unconvincing ... that no matter how well-got-up Bud Flanagan was, even if he were dressed by Hartnell, nobody would believe he was an aristocrat. So I said, 'Look Chris, why don't you cut William Hickey's column out of the paper?! -- \nHe stops talking, as he looks across at the silent Jo. Helen and the others, follow his look. They watch her sympathetically. Jo  seems totally unaware that anyone else is in the room, staring, into thin air, absorbed with thoughts of her own. \nVAL (Softly) Jo. Jo. \nJO Huh? \nVAL What's become of that unpredictable husband of yours? (Consults his watch) He's been gone over an hour. \nShe doesn't answer, so he goes on. \nVAL Who was it he went to see?   Some man named... (Looks at group for help) ...what was it...Church? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                96. \nINT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nSlowly Jo's expression begins to chance to one of interest. We see a flood of thoughts expressed in her face. She looks across at Val and replies: \nJO No.   No...you mean Chappell! \nShe rises from her chair with some excitement.    She murmurs, almost to herself: \nJO It's not a man, it's a place! Ambrose Chapel! Ambrose Chapel! It has to be! \nINT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nThe others watch Jo, puzzled at her strange performance. No one dares speak until she finds out what it means. \nINT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT \nWith some excitement, Jo addresses Val Parnell. \nJ0 Do they list chapels in the London Telephone Directory? \nVAL Let's a take a look. \nHe crosses to the telephone desk, picks up telephone directory and opens it. \nINT.

It's just a short way from here. It was a crazy thing to do -- \nINT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nBEN (Interrupting hurriedly) I have the address, Jo. Now stay there until I get there...and don't do anything! \nINT. LONDON CALL BOX - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nJo loses some of her anxiety. \nJO I'll meet you outside. \nShe hangs up, sighs and starts out of the phone booth. \nINT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT \nBen hangs up the phone and starts for the door. He looks back at the group as he pauses in doorway. \nBEN Will you stick around? We'll be back as soon as we can. I don't know how to thank you. \nHe goes out through the door closing it.    Everyone stands staring at the door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nJo stands watching something across the street. \nEXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT \nFrom Jo's viewpoint, the exterior of Ambrose Chapel. An old building, silent and deserted. A faded sign outside identifies it. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 101. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT \nA non-conformist Chapel. Empty, except for    one figure, a woman laying out music on the organ rack   in the front of the Chapel. The CAMERA MOVES IN on her,    and as she turns on her way to the hymn board, we see   that she is Mrs. Drayton. At the hymn board, she slips    into it a series of hymn numbers. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe CAMERA THEN PANS her across the empty chapel to a side door. She goes through it. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nShe comes up a flight of stairs, the CAMERA MOVING with her. She stops at a door on the first landing, takes a key out of her pocket, and unlocks the door. She enters. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nInside of a small, almost bare room, Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind her and stands with her back to it, watching. The CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY to reveal the rest of the room. Sitting at a small table is a listless, young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the woman we saw at the airport who was standing with the autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with the dirty glasses, who made a phone call. Hank has caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious satisfaction jumps three of her men. \nHANK Three men! You don't know much about checkers, do you? \nMRS. DRAYTON It's time you went to bed, dear.    You'll get tired out. \nHANK Can I finish? I'm winning? \nMRS. DRAYTON Yes, you finish. Edna, see that he gets some milk and biscuits. \nEDNA And he'd better have another sleeping pill...I've got to get downstairs -- \nMRS. DRAYTON (To Hank) You'll go to sleep, Hank, won't you? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               102. \nHANK I guess so. \nEDNA Hurry up if you want to finish this game. \nMRS. DRAYTON Look it doesn't hurt to be kind. Yell out when you want me to open the door. \nEdna studies the board with a frown.   Mrs. Drayton smiles and goes out the door. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT \nIn the corridor once again Mrs. Drayton locks the door, and crosses the hall. The CAMERA PANNING her. She enters another door. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT \nShe enters a larger, more ornate room. The CAMERA PANS her in, and we see first Drayton, who is putting on a surplice -- and then the man who knocked on the McKennas' door in the Mamounia Hotel, looking for someone named Montgomery. He is putting on a tie and tuxedo. He wears a dangerous-looking revolver strapped underneath his armpit; Mrs. Drayton, without a word, sits down and lights a cigarette, exhaling with something close to fatigue. Then she speaks. \nMRS. DRAYTON I wish it was tomorrow. \nDrayton turns, having finished his dressing. \nDRAYTON (Coldly) That's not a very orthodox sentiment. \nHe goes to a desk, and takes something out of a drawer. It is a small envelope. He turns to the man with the gun. \nDRAYTON Two excellent tickets for the concert at the Albert Hall -- with my compliments. \nHe hands them to Rien. Rien takes the envelope, glances at it briefly, then puts it into his pocket. \nDRAYTON Your box is nicely placed, or shall we say strategically placed. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              103. \nHe goes to a portable record player, which is open and has a record on it. He looks down at the phonograph. \nDRAYTON Now for the most important part. \nHe gestured towards the record. \nRIEN What is it? \nDRAYTON A record of the delightful Picco they will play tonight. \nRIEN What about it? \nDRAYTON Music is less in your line than marksmanship. If you will listen, my friend, I will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot. Now listen carefully. \nDrayton plays the record. \nDRAYTON Let me do it for you again.   Now listen for the cymbal crash. \nDrayton plays the record again and claps his hands together at the cymbal crash. \nDRAYTON You see at such a moment your shot will not be heard. The listeners will not even be disturbed. I think the composer would have appreciated that. No one will know. \nRIEN None except one you mean. \nThe assassin smiles. \nHalf-glancing at Drayton as he delivers his sermon. Ben talks to Jo. Their conversation is whispered. \nBEN That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on out and call him and ask him to surround the place with police. \nJO What if he asks me... \nBEN Tell him...tell him everything. This is the time. I'm sure Hank is around here some place. \nJO Ben, I don't want to leave you. \nBEN I don't know how else to do it, honey. \nBen gives her a gentle push. With a regretful look at him, she slides out of the seat. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nIn the middle of his sermon, Drayton looks up. He almost falters and stops, as he sees Jo rise from her seat. \nThe chapel as seen from Drayton's viewpoint. Jo has turned up the aisle and gone out the door at the back. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nDrayton composes his face, but his eyes are serious. Without the slightest pause, he continues his sermon, shifting his ideas in mid-paragraph. \nDRAYTON Few of us pause to think how life's adversities work in our behalf, to make better men and women of us. (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 109. \nDRAYTON (CONT'D) But I believe we should pause now to do a little stock-taking -- to look into our own hearts and see what we find there. Therefore instead of continuing the service, I think we should all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for. Next week I shall discuss the fruits of our meditation. Until then, my blessing upon each and every one of you. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nBen watches Drayton, with little charity in his heart. There is a stir in the congregation when Drayton tells them to go home. They look at each other, uncertainly. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT \nDrayton closes the Bible, and begins to descend from the pulpit. The congregation comes to life. The members rise from their seats and begin filing out of the chapel. Occasionally they cast backward glances toward the pulpit, as if surprised at what they have heard. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nWhen Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton goes off through a side door by the altar, while the organist makes her way down the aisle through the congregation to stand by the door. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel, Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets him with bland amiability. \nDRAYTON Well this is a pleasant surprise, Doctor. \nBEN Where's my boy, Drayton? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 110. \nDRAYTON He's upstairs. As a matter of fact you've just come in time to help my wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank doesn't care much for English cooking. \nDrayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows it cautiously. But before he can confirm his suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT \nAt the other end of the chapel, the woman, Edna, has just closed the door, and is in the process of locking the heavy iron lock with a large key. She extracts the key and puts it into her pocket. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nBen turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat of his robes. \nBEN What do you want? I'll give you money and keep my mouth shut. All I want is my boy. \nDRAYTON And what about your wife? Did she go outside just to get some fresh air. \nBEN Tell me what you want.   I'll do anything. \nDRAYTON All right -- you'll see your boy in good time. \nWith a sudden twist, he wrenches himself away from Ben. He reaches for a button on the altar, presses it. Instantly the door by the side of the altar opens and two rather strong men appear. Ben turns alertly to face them, backing of a little. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nOne of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves. Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and suddenly dashes for the steps. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 111. \nHe surprises them with his speed, and before anyone can stop him, he is in the pulpit. He grabs the microphone previously used by Drayton in his sermon. He yells into it. \nBEN Hank! Hank McKenna!    Hank!   Where are you? Hank! Hank! \nAs the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash for the pulpit, and at that mount we hear, faintly off, the voice of Hank: \nHANK Daddy!   Daddy, I'm here!   Dad - \nHis voice is choked off. Ben jumps down from the pulpit in an effort to make for the open door, but the two men throw themselves on top of him. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nJo speaks into the phone with great urgency. \nJO ...And Ben is in there now, watching the both of them! \nINT. SPECIAL BRANCH OFFICE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nWoburn, assistant to Buchanan, is listening intently on the phone. The office behind him is not handsomely appointed. Jo's voice is heard on filter. \nJ0 He sent me out to call you -- so we could do something before they get away. \nWOBURN I see, Mrs. McKenna -- and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel? \nJO I don't know, I don't know where he is...but at least these people will know -- the Draytons. If you'd only send somebody to get them. \nWOBURN I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nJo interrupts him, impatient with his caution. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 112. \nJ0 Mr. Woburn, there isn't any time! My husband is sitting in that chapel waiting for me to bring some help. Can't I talk with Mr. Buchanan? He said when we needed him, to call. \nINT. SPECIAL BRANCH OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nWoburn is concerned. \nWOBURN I'm awfully sorry, but I simply can't get hold of him just now. He's gone to a rather important diplomatic affair -- at the Albert Hall. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nJo is tired of his talk.   She wants action. \nEXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nPatterson and Jo peer in the windows.   They apparently see nothing. \nEXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAnother policeman is checking the windows on the other side. Nothing. \nEXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe third policeman is checking the alleyway in back of the Chapel. He sees no sign of anything suspicious. Patterson and Jo come around the back and try the back door. \nEXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe back door is firmly locked. \nMATTHEWS There's no one there, sir. \nPATTERSON Are you quite certain the place was full of people -- only a few minutes ago? \nJO Of course I'm certain. I was there myself, sitting next to my husband. He sent me out to call Scotland Yard. \nHe looks at her quizzically. \nJ0 It's much too complicated to explain. \nPATTERSON We'll just have to sit tight and wait for the car to arrive from the Yard. \nHe starts for the front of the Chapel, and Jo, unhappily, is forced to follow. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  117. \nINT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe chapel is deserted inside. In the dim light we can see a form stretched out on the floor. It is Ben. He begins to stir a little as if just beginning to come to after being knocked unconscious. \nEXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe policemen are grouped around the patrol car, as Patterson, the sergeant, talks over a radio telephone. \nPATTERSON So far as we can make out, sir, there's no sign of life. I see, very good, Sir. \nHe hangs up, and gets out of the open car.    He turns to one of his men. \nPATTERSON Walden, you'll stay here, till the car arrives from the Yard. \nWALDEN Okay. \nPATTERSON That's all, Matthews. \nThe other policeman gets into the car, Leaving the door open for the Sergeant. \nJO You're not leaving? \nPATTERSO (Politely) Orders, madam. Can we give you lift somewhere? \nJo is frustrated, and irritated, but she thinks for a moment and makes a sudden decision. \nJO Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall. \nPatterson looks at her with tolerant surprise. \nPATTERSON Afraid the Albert Hall's a bit off our beat. Suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank? \nJo looks back at the Chapel briefly. \nJO All right.   Let's go. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              118. \nThey get into the car, and the CAMERA PANS it, as it drives away down the long Victoria London street, which now remains deserted. \nEXT. EMBASSY - (DAY) - MED. SHOT \nThe exterior rear of a huge residential building such as is to be found in Kensington Palace Gardens or Belgrave Square. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see a Humber car driving through the gates at the rear. It pulls up at the Service entrance. A man sitting beside the chauffeur gets out of the car. Inside the car are the Draytons and Hark McKenna. We see the man hurry to the door of the kitchen and enter. \nINT. EMBASSY KITCHEN - (DAY) - MED. SHOT \nThere is a big staff of kitchen help, chefs, maids of middle-age, all preparing food for what is obviously a big party. The man who has entered, calls to them to get their attention. \nGUARD Hello.   Hello. \nThe work falls quiet as they become aware of him. \nGUARD Everybody out into the corridor.   Hurry (He claps his hands) \nThere is a moment of bewilderment and confusion. The man crosses to someone obviously a butler, and whispers some words to him. The butler turns to the workers and starts herding them toward the corridor through a door in the far corner of the kitchen. \nBUTLER Do what he says. Come on. It will only be a minute. Come on, all of you -- out. \nThe man goes to the door. \nEXT. EMBASSY - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT \nHe leans out the door and beckons the Draytons and Hank to come in quickly.

They are talking, grumbling. \nWOMAN COOK This embassy -- there's always something queer going on. \nINT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT \nWhile the other servants are grumbling, one is saying nothing. He rather a Shrewd-looking young footman. He strains to listen through closed door. Coming from the kitchen are several sounds. A door opening, the walking of feet, and finally the slam of a door. \nANOTHER VOICE Bringing people in, in secret... \nANOTHER VOICE Give me the Swiss Embassy every time, there's neutrality for you! \nThen the sound of a car leaving outside. The door to the kitchen opens and the servants, including the young footman enter again. \nINT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe young footman, among the first to enter, surveys the kitchen. There is no sign of anyone having passed through. \nEXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT \nThe street before the chapel is still deserted, and the light of day is beginning to fade. Suddenly the silence is broken by the sound of the bell ringing spasmodically in the chapel belfry. Along the street a few people begin putting their heads out of windows, and the one policeman left in charge is seen hurrying away down the street. \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK and we now see that the crowd in the lobby is thinning out. Jo stands alone, jostled by a stream of late arrivals. From the hall itself we can hear the SOUND of the orchestra tuning up, followed by a burst of applause, with a few shouts which obviously herald the arrival of the visiting dignitary in his box. \nINT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP \nJo stares toward the opening into the hall. She seems drawn to go in. She crosses and the CAMERA FOLLOWS her to the first entrance to the outer corridor. \nINT. CORRIDOR - (DAY) - CLOSEUP \nJo stands for a moment and then slowly crosses the corridor to the main entrance where the ticket collector and a programme girl stand. As she approaches the opening, the ticket collector steps forward. \nTICKET COLLECTOR Your ticket, madam? \nJo shakes her heads. \nJO If you don't mind, I'm just looking for someone. \nShe takes a step or two forward as some new arrivals take up the attention of the ticket collector. The programme girl escorts them out of the scene. \nINT. HALL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP \nJo stares at the vast hall in front of her. \nINT.

A footman comes up to them and announces: \nFOOTMAN His Excellency will see you now. \nDrayton motions to his wife and the CAMERA PANS them after the footman across a small hallway. He is the very same footman we saw among the group of servants who were herded out of the kitchen. He opens a door in front of the Draytons -- they enter. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED.

They are staggered at this news. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               139. \nAMBASSADOR His aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect. The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm. Worse than useless. \nDrayton still stares, petrified, at the Ambassador. \nAMBASSADOR Then your French friend panicked, and made a fatal crash -- landing on the floor of the Albert Hall. \nDRAYTON (Blustering weakly) I don't see how you can hold me responsible. He was most warmly recommended by our people in Marrakesh... \nThe Ambassador now begins to get really nasty. \nAMBASSADOR I'm glad you're able to treat the matter so lightly. I am holding a reception here this evening. In a few minutes, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor -- when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. That amuses you, no doubt? \nDRAYTON (Feebly) I don't know what to say ... \nAMBASSADOR (Brutally) No. But I do. You've muddled everything from the start. Kidnapping that child in Marrakesh...Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children kidnapped? \nDRAYTON (Trying to keep his end up) How else could I make sure the American would hold his tongue? \nAMBASSADOR (Ignoring this) And then, to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide -- and bring the child with you: Don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this Embassy? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 140. \nDRAYTON (Weakly) I didn't think...I only thought... \nAMBASSADOR (Staccato) How are you going to get the child out of here, eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? \nDRAYTON (Struggling for self-confidence) There's no difficulty about that, surely? The car -- \nAMBASSADOR (Interrupting) With plain-clothes detectives planted right round this building? (Wryly) You English intellectuals will be the death of us all. \nDRAYTON (Desperate) I'll think of some method.   Just give me time.... \nAMBASSADOR (He snorts Contemptuously) Time! \nThe Ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage, and then he stops and looks at Drayton as if thinking about something. \nAMBASSADOR I want the child removed from this Embassy, and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say any more where he has been tonight. \nMRS. DRAYTON Oh, no! \nThe Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth. Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible servility. \nDRAYTON Right, I'll see to it.. \nLucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                       141. \nAMBASSADOR Come in. \nThe door opens and a butler enters. \nBUTLER Your Excellency, the Princess should be arriving at any moment. \nThe Ambassador braces himself, his       chest swells out a little, h assumes a set smile and       strides from the room. Just at this moment we hear        a String Orchestra in the distance strike up some gay       waltz music. The Ambassador goes out of the door.

EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT \nHaving strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays the introduction to her song. We see the great tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place that she has become so professional in such an intimate drawing room setting. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - FULL SHOT \nEveryone in the ballroom is listening intently, and with surprise, at her singing. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 148. \nINT.

Hank seems a little puzzled. Then, his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his feet. He runs towards the door and begins trying to open it. \nHANK That's my Mother's voice!    That's my Mother singing! \nMrs. Drayton is quite startled by Hank's performance. \nMRS. DRAYTON Hank -- are you sure? Are you really sure? \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nHank turns around at the doorway, to look at Mrs. Drayton. \nHANK That's her!

DRAYTON What is she doing here? \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nHank, a little mystified, has no answer. He walks slowly back into the room, towards Mrs. Drayton, listening and thinking about what he hears. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT \nMrs. Drayton's face shows a new and dangerous thought coming into it. She looks down at Hank. \nMRS. DRAYTON Hank? -- can you whistle that song? \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nHe looks at her and nods abstractedly. \nHANK I guess so. \nShe kneels down quickly to him. \nMRS DRAYTON Then go on -- whistle it.   Whistle it as loud as you can. \nOn Hank's face comes a little understanding. He can barely believe what she means. Then he understands. He turns, and deliberately facing the door, starts to whistle the song. He whistles loud and vigorously. Mrs. Drayton stands up and moves back to a chair, as she watches him. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT \nDown in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for the straining ears of Jo. She looks across the ballroom to find Ben, and her eyes go up. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 150. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \n", "test3_true": "INT.

She looks across at the window. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                   151. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe barred window. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nShe looks down at Hank almost protectively, as  the footsteps get still nearer.

EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT \nThe door handle turns quietly, but firmly. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nMrs. Drayton lets out a piercing scream. Hank's head jerks up.

EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nFramed in the doorway is Drayton. Deftly he reaches into his pocket and produces a small automatic. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT \nFor a moment the group stands there in silence.    Then Ben speaks. \nBEN I don't think you want to start any shooting, Drayton -- with all those people downstairs, and police outside. \nDrayton looks at him without saying anything, but the gun doesn't lower. \nMrs. Drayton addresses her husband fiercely. \nMRS.

EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT \nDrayton seems unperturbed by Ben's refusal. He leans down closer to the boy, and addresses him directly. \nDRAYTON You wouldn't want your father to get hurt, would you? \nHank looks up towards his father.    Drayton looks up. \nINT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nDrayton's intentions are unmistakable. Ben looks down at him with a hatred that is almost ready to explode, but he has sense enough to understand Drayton's meaning. Drayton straightens up, a slight smile on his face. He slips the gun into his pocket, but still holds it. \nDRAYTON We'll go down the stairs   together in a casual sort of way. Then    we'll stroll along to the nearest taxi   rank. I trust there won't be any   emotional outbursts... \nBEN (Interrupting) There won't be. Hank -- don't say or do anything. \nHank just nods.   He's too frightened to talk. \nDRAYTON Shall we go? \nBen starts for the door with Hank, and Drayton moves into the other side of Hank. As they go through the door, Mrs. Drayton makes an instinctive step forward, if to attack Drayton from the rear, but the sight of Hank in danger stops her. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 153. \nINT.

The CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD in front of them as they descend. The music coming from the ballroom ceases, as Jo finishes her second song. There is the sound of great applause. The three are about a dozen steps from the bottom, when suddenly Ben shoots out a hard and pushes Drayton forward. Taken by surprise, he stumbles, and falls down the stairs clumsily. Clutching for support with his hands, the gun goes off in his pocket, and he remains in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs. \nINT.

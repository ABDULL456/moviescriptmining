TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers. 
DON CORLEONE What is this nonsense? 
HAGEN It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film. 
INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945) 
It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably; mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something wet. 
He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet. He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood. 
WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out. Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him. 
INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945) 
CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding. 
DON CORLEONE Send Johnny my congratulations. 
----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------- 
(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED) 
FADE IN: 
EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945) 
Fifth Avenue in the snow.  Christmas week.  People are bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents. 
KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store, carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm. 
KAY We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen... 
MICHAEL And what do you want for Christmas? 
KAY Just you. 
They kiss. 
INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945) 
CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.  THE VIEW PANS AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight. 
MICHAEL (O.S.) We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony at the City Hall, no big fuss, no family, just a couple of friends as witnesses. 
The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on the two single beds that they have pushed together. 
KAY What will your father say? 
MICHAEL As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object. 
KAY What time do they expect us? 
MICHAEL For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire. 
KAY Michael. 
MICHAEL Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night. 
He moves to the telephone. 
MICHAEL (CONT'D.) Operator.  Get me (fill in number) 
KAY Michael, what are you doing? 
MICHAEL Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here. 
KAY Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please. 
She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception. 
MICHAEL Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah... listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning.  There's something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas.  Will he be home tomorrow night? 
INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945) 
HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.  In the background, through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in his office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork. 
HAGEN (O.S.) Sure.  Anything I can do for you. 
MICHAEL (O.S.) No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right? 
HAGEN Right. 
He smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and hat, and continues out. 
He peeks into the DON's office. 
HAGEN Michael called; he's not leaving New Hampshire until tomorrow morning.  I've got to go, I promised Theresa I'd pick up some toys for the kids. 
The DON smiles and nods. 
TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE. FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE, raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the paper. 
DON CORLEONE Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot; I'll be ready to go home in a few minutes. 
FREDO I'll have to get it myself; Paulie called in sick this morning. 
DON CORLEONE That's the third time this month. I think maybe you'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me.  Tell Tom.

Morrie pulls out a wad of money and proffers it to Solly. 
MORRIE Here's for six months in advance. Three hundred pounds. Solly pushes the money back. 
SOLLY Six months? I don't know your boy'll last six minutes. 
PK I'll last. 
Solly notices that every black fighter in the gym has stopped working and is staring at PK. 
SOLLY 
What are you staring? Punch, don't stare. C'mon. Work or you're out. 
The blacks go back to work. SOLLY That your gear? 
PK Yes, sir. 
SOLLY Go change in the back. We'll see if you couldn't find a better use for all that money. 
PK Thank you, sir. 
PK heads towards the rear.      Solly turns to Morrie. 
SOLLY Why's he want to do this, a nice- looking schoolboy? 
MORRIE He wants to be welterweight champ of the world. 
Solly breaks up laughing. 
SOLLY Oh sure, sure. And I'd like to be twenty-five again. 
MORRIE You like to make book on it? 
SOLLY (joking) You giving odds? 
MORRIE You name them. 
Solly gives him a long look. 
SOLLY You both meshugah. 
Solly walks away. 
CUT TO: 
56   INT. GYM - RING                                           56 
PK is in the ring getting ready to spar with a well-built opponent. Morrie stands at ringside with Solly. SOLLY Let's just start out nice and easy now. 
He hits the bell. The fighters circle. PK's opponent starts punching, jabbing, probing. After two feints he comes after PK in earnest. PK steps left and peppers him with three quick blows to the face. Solly's interest is suddenly piqued. Again the fighters circle. Again the opponent sets up with jabs and again he attacks. This time PK dodges, hits him hard and spins him around, hitting him twice more. A smile appears on Solly's face. The opponent, angered now, gets more aggressive. PK keeps bobbing and weaving, sticking and slipping punches. The opponent unloads, banging away at PK with everything he has. PK backs up two steps, then shifts positions. The opponent's momentum carries him into the ropes. As he comes off the ropes PK throws him an eight-punch combination, demolishing his opponent. PK steps back. The opponent sags. Solly hits the bell, clearly excited. 
SOLLY Never I seen someone so young throw an eight-punch combination. Where did you learn such a thing? 
PK In prison, sir. 
SOLLY You trying to be a comedian and a boxer? Mr. Manager, come to my office. We'll talk terms. You, get showered, and see me after. We'll talk training. Solly and Morrie head off toward Solly's office. PK watches them go, a small victorious smile on his face. 
CUT TO: 
57   EXT. BARBETON PRISON GATE                                 57 
Seven-year-old PK stands at the gate holding a bucket, waiting to be let in. 
CUT TO: 
58   INT. PRISON HALL                                          58 
PK sits on a bench in the hall. Black prisoners are marched by, guarded closely. At PK's feet is the metal bucket.  The door to Kommandant Von Zyl's office opens. A guard summons PK. PK rises, takes his bucket and enters the office. 
CUT TO: 
59   INT. VON ZYL'S OFFICE                                     59 The KOMMANDANT, a brusque man with a salt-and-pepper brush cut sits behind his big desk. 
VON ZYL (KOMMANDANT) So you are PK. 
PK Yes, sir. 
VON ZYL I am Kommandant Von Zyl. The professor has requested you to be his visitor so you can continue your studies on piano and he can continue with his studies on cactus. This is the first specimen? 
He alludes to the bucket. PK Yes, sir.   Kalanchoe Thrysiflora. He holds the bucket up. 
60   VON ZYL'S POV                                             60 A small cactus resting on some tobacco leaves. 
61   BACK TO SCENE                                             61 
VON ZYL The professor taught you this, ja? Of course to your English town he is a prisoner, a criminal. To us who respect such learning and culture, he is an honored guest. 
He hands PK a pass. 
VON ZYL This pass is good for any time, any day. Would you like to see him now? 
PK Yes, sir. VON ZYL Come.   I will take you myself. Von Zyl rises and opens the door for PK.    They exit.

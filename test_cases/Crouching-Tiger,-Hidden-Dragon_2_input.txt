May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head. Bo kneels beside her. 
MAY Father! 
EXT. TE'S - DAY 
Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed from over the body of Tsai.  Bo and May stand before them. 
TE This is Tsai? 
MAY My father.  Police Inspector from Shaan. 
TE This should be reported to Governor Yu.  The victim is an officer.  You believe the killer is hiding out in his compound. 
YU I'd bet my life on it! 
TE (to Li and Yu) Come with me. 
He exits the room. 
INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY 
Te, Li, and Yu are seated. 
SIR TE This needs to be resolved, and quickly. 
LI I'll get into the Yu household and get her.  I'll ferret out Fox and her gang. 
YU We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble. 
SIR TE This is a delicate matter. 
YU Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter? 
SIR TE What do you have in mind? 
YU The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs. 
Sir Te and Li look puzzled. 
EXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN - DAY 
Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen.  They busy themselves with various items for her trousseau. 
MADAM YU Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.

TIN CUP It just don't get much better than this... 
CLINT/EARL You the man, Cup, you the man... 
Romeo leans over to Doreen amidst the chaos and speaks with suave elegance. 
ROMEO You're looking particularly lovely this evening... the coif is extraordinary. 
DOREEN Why thank you... Romeo.

All twelve of them are asleep or nearly so in the R.V., sprawled on and over every surface. Much snoring. 
CLOSE ON MOLLY 
Her face close to Tin Cup's.    Both awake. 
MOLLY You nervous about tomorrow? 
TIN CUP Yeah, I'm nervous. So's everybody else. But I only gotta come and catch Simms. Sixty-seven guys gotta come and get me... 
Silence.   Except for the random snore. 
TIN CUP It won't always be like this... y'know... with me... surrounded by all these guys... snoring... a stripper ex-girlfriend on the floor... my caddie sleeping next to her... all of us damn near broke... won't always be like this... 
She puts her finger over his mouth gently. 
MOLLY Yes it will... yes it will... and it's okay...

Molly serves coffee to the regulars.     She's upset. 
MOLLY Which one of you is the bookie? 
DEWEY We all are, but Earl's the best. 
MOLLY What are the odds that Roy will win? 
EARL Vegas has him at ten to one. They're sure he's gonna self-destruct. 
MOLLY Those sound good to me -- I want you to place a bet for me. Five thousand nine hundred dollars on Tin Cup to win. 
They stare nervously. 
CURT That's your nestegg. 
EARL That's a bad idea, honey -- we love him, but he's gonna fuck- up -- 
MOLLY I said put it all on Roy.    Got it? 
DEWEY We can't let you -- 
MOLLY Boys -- 
Silence.   Molly's in charge.    She hands them a roll of cash. 
MOLLY Put it all on Tin Cup. 
Earl reluctantly takes the money.

Tin Cup hits putts, intense, focused.    Peter Jacobsen works his way over to Tin Cup.

TIN CUP Musta got too much sleep last night. How you choking? 
JACOBSEN Just got one thought in my head. Ten under. That's my number. 
Tin Cup looks up, amused by the gamesmanship. 
TIN CUP No one's ever been ten under for the Open, not even Nicklaus. 
JACOBSEN That's right, Ledge. Not even Nicklaus. 
And he moves off to putt. Tin Cup drops a couple balls on the green to putt, and:

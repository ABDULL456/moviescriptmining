Divinci slams his foot down on the accelerator and -- 
THE CAR 
-- tears off down the street. 
CUT TO: 
RODRIGUEZ - INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 
asleep. Alone in a double bed. The PHONE RINGS. Rodriguez startles awake. Catches the phone on the second ring. 
RODRIGUEZ Who the hell is this? 
INTERCUT WITH DIVINCI - INT. MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
Divinci on the phone in the f.g. Joe is passed out on the bed in the b.g. The room is dark. 
DIVINCI Is that any way to answer the phone? 
RODRIGUEZ Divinci, shit! It's quarter to six. 
DIVINCI I know what time it is, I'm not the one in bed. I need the photos of the scene. 
RODRIGUEZ Now? 
DIVINCI I got a suspect. But he can't remember all the details. He needs a little help. And I thought, since you're my partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin' hand. 
Rodriguez sits up in bed. 
RODRIGUEZ He doesn't remember last Friday? 
DIVINCI He doesn't remember a lotta Fridays. Bring the shots and pick up a fifth of Vodka. (glances at Joe) Make it two. 
CUT TO: 
JOE - INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
asleep on the bed. 
DIVINCI Time to get up, Joe. 
Divinci slaps him. Joe's eyes open. 
DIVINCI I want you to look at something. 
The room is still dark. Curtains drawn. We now see Rodriguez. He's wearing a black sock cap and gloves. He hands Divinci POLICE PHOTOGRAPHS of the car, the street, the victim -- the murder scene. Divinci pulls Joe into a sitting position. 
DIVINCI There's the guy and the street and the car. You remember how you shot him. 
Joe stares at the photographs and starts to shake his head. 
DIVINCI You don't remember? That's not what you told me last night. 
Joe is confused. 
DIVINCI If you remember you can have a drink. 
Joe looks at the bottle Rodriguez holds out to him. 
DIVINCI But you gotta remember how you saw him driving toward you and you were in the street and you were afraid he was going to hit you so you had to shoot to protect yourself. You remember now don't you? 
Joe stares at the photographs for a moment, then nods. 
DIVINCI And where's your gun, Joe, where do you keep your gun? 
Joe thinks a moment, then reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out the .44. Divinci hands Joe the bottle and Joe drinks. We PUSH IN on the BOTTLE OF VODKA as the liquid drains away and we CLOSE IN TIGHT until we can SEE LIONEL HUDD'S FACE as we -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CLOSE UP - THE PHOTOGRAPHS 
Hudd dead. Blood on the windows. The street. Joe is drunk again. In a haze. Starts to lift the bottle. Rodriguez pulls it away. Rodriguez and Divinci always stay behind Joe. 
RODRIGUEZ Why'd you kill him? 
WILLIAM I... don't know... 
RODRIGUEZ It was your gun. 
WILLIAM ...I don't have a gun. 
DIVINCI Yes you do. In your pocket. 
WILLIAM ...I'm tired. 
DIVINCI I know, Joe, it's tough to remember things you don't wanna remember. What about your last name, Joe. You got a last name? 
Joe looks up as if trying to remember. Or trying not to. 
RODRIGUEZ Come on, Joe, everybody's got a last name. 
WILLIAM I don't remember. 
RODRIGUEZ Don't fuck with us, Joe. We're trying to help you. What's your last goddamn name?

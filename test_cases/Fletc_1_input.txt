MRS. STANWYK He never sees them and I never met them. 
FLETCH How come? 
SFX: Insistent knock at door. 
Fletch and Mrs. Stanwyk freeze. 
MRS. STANWYK Yes? 
MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here...I'm a new member. 
Fletch rises. 
FLETCH Thanks for the great time. 
MRS. STANWYK (sotto voice) What is this? 
FLETCH Long story. 
MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill. 
MRS. STANWYK (hissing) John! 
Fletch starts pushing the lunch table towards the bathroom. 
MRS. STANWYK You don't know the Underhills? 
MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you. 
MRS. STANWYK I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute? 
MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Of course. 
Mrs. Stanwyk follows Fletch into the bathroom. 
160 INT BATHROOM 
Fletch jams the cart into the bathroom. 
FLETCH Take one end. 
Mrs. Stanwyk lifts one side of the cart. They lift it and put it up into the bathtub. There's a window in the bathroom. Fletch opens it. 
FLETCH I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk. 
MRS. STANWYK I think you should call me Gail, now. 
FLETCH Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him. 
MRS. STANWYK Why did you do it? 
Fletch shrugs, smiles. 
MRS. STANWYK A four hundred dollar lunch tab! 
FLETCH Yeah. 
MRS. STANWYK I'll cover it. You have any other surprises? 
FLETCH (after a beat) Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding. 
She stares at him. 
MRS. STANWYK Who. 
FLETCH Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe. 
A long beat. 
MRS. STANWYK So? 
FLETCH So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth. 
MRS. STANWYK What are you talking about? 
FLETCH That's what I want to know.

TOMMY (thoughtful) Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad? 
ELLIE I don't know Tommy. 
A LONG BEAT as TOMMY thinks about this.  His attention switches to a passing McDONALD'S. 
TOMMY Hey, can we go to McDonald's? 
ELLIE Absolutely. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MILTON GREGORY - BANQUET HALL - EVENING 
Overhead, chandeliers gleam.  A small orchestra comprised of STUDENTS of the school plays a variety of tunes. Mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers, carved gilt and candlelight. 
Gloved service PERSONNEL wait to be of service at the sides.  The room is quite large yet intimate.  The tables set perfectly.  GUESTS continue to move toward their places engaged in animated chatter. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  CLAIRE moving through the crowd, PLAINCLOTHESMEN flanking her as anonymously as possible (KOONTZ among them), HER EYES anxious, scanning the crowd. 
SHE'S SPOTTED by the PRINCIPAL of the school (GIDDINGS), who APPROACHES, surprised to see her. 
GIDDINGS Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came. 
CLAIRE It was something my father always liked me to do. 
GIDDINGS (apprehensive) You're planning to speak? 
CLAIRE Not if you don't want me to. 
GIDDINGS (a brief hesitation) Well, of course, we'd be... honored... 
CLAIRE (understands; gamely) Just putting in an appearance then. 
SHE GLANCES around, her "ESCORTS" mistaking it for anxiety, one of them taking her arm and escorting her in. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER 
SPEECHES droning on -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE at a round dinner table, with OTHERS, who think they're engaging her in conversation; but her thoughts are elsewhere, her eyes continually glancing toward the doors -- both hoping and fearing. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER 
The SPEECHES have long since ENDED, PEOPLE DANCING, slow dances to the live orchestra -- CAMERA PANNING to CLAIRE, sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated table, having lost hope, feeling utterly alone.  Her chin is resting in her hand, her eyes fixed sadly on her wine glass.  PLAINCLOTHESMEN, situated around her, study her dispassionately. 
CLOSE ON HER FACE:  expressionless.  But it slowly gains animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a segue to something new.  It's "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME." 
SHE LOOKS UP -- to see MIKE; his approach from the bandstand indicating that the change of music was his doing. 
HER FACE breaks into the most enormous, and grateful, GRIN. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  returning the smile as he COMES TOWARD. 
KOONTZ (as he passes) Don't do it, man.  I love ya, but you're out of your mind. 
Uncaring, MIKE MOVES TO CLAIRE. 
ANGLE ON BOTH:  gazing at each other. 
CLAIRE (overwhelmed) What a memory. 
MIKE Do you dance? 
CLAIRE Do you? 
MIKE Pretty bad. 
CLAIRE Let's do it. 
They TAKE to the FLOOR, she MOVING INTO HIS ARMS.  She puts her head on his shoulder, then draws back to look at him, studying his face with the hunger of a woman who knows it might be for the last time. 
MIKE They guys treatin' you all right? 
CLAIRE (too emotional to really talk) Yeah. 
MIKE I've been doing a lot of thinking. 
CLAIRE (a pause) I know. 
CLOSE ON HIM:  studying her saddened eyes.

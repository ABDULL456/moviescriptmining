ARCH (nervously, a laugh) Hey, what's this...? 
SKIP You up for a game of stretch? 
CHAZ (still taping, to Skip) Your fly's open. 
SKIP Eat it. 
CHAZ (undaunted, to Rob) Your fly's open. (SHRUGS) Ok, so don't believe me. 
He keeps the tape rolling. Rob discreetly looks down. His fly is open. Kit looks at him dubiously. Rob zips. Chaz beams, getting it all for posterity. The engine finally engages. The ferry lurches. 
ROB (smiles weakly to Kit) We're off! 
They are indeed. 
EXT. THE SOUND - DISTANT POV - DAY 
The ferry pulls away from the mainland. 
EXT. THE FERRY - DAY 
A CLOSER ANGLE. The sturdy, barge like ship craft makes progress. The Ferryman and Buck remain at the stern. 
ECU - THE DECK 
As Skip's knife flies INTO FRAME, it bites into the boards and holds. SKIP AND ARCH 
at their game. Arch stretches, can't reach the knife, and topples over. 
Skip hoots triumphantly. 
SKIP First round, the champ! 
NIKKI AND HARVEY 
Nikki, much to her chagrin, finds herself the object of Harvey's attentions. 
HARVEY Y'know what I find amazin'? Muffy's her real name. I mean, I'm Harvey, but they call me Hal, so I thought, 'Muffy', it must stand for something... Muffin? 
NIKKI Muffers, Moffo, Muff-child , Muffin' stuff, the Muffster... 
HARVEY (GRINS) I bet you're her oldest friend. 
NIKKI (BORED) Actually, she's three months older than I am. 
HARVEY You know what I mean. 
NIKKI Harvey... are you planning a career in politics when you grow up? 
HARVEY I've given it some thought. Why? 
NIKKI Oh, just a hunch. 
HARVEY First, though, I'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation... Y'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter! 
She just stares at him. CLOSE UP - THE KNIFE 
digging into the deck again. 
ARCH (O.S.) Jesus... 
ARCH and SKIP 
The knife is at an impossible distance. 
SKIP (LAUGHING) Go for it, big fella. 
Arch swallows his pride and makes a hopeless attempt. 
CHAZ fastens onto Nan, immersed in one of her books. He carries his own. 
CHAZ (sitting beside her) Whatcha readin'? 
NAN Milton. Paradise Lost. For Professor Russo's course on the English epic... It's a shame. It's a dying form. Not too many people read it nowadays, even in college. What's yours? 
CHAZ (SHOWS HER) Suck and fuck.

SGT.WILLI 
(WEAKLY) Yes Colonel. 
COL.LANDA Tell me everything that happened in there? The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again, and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark, dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three basterds in their tuxedos, flank her. 
CU COL.LANDA smiles. He descends the stairs, towards the four saboteurs... They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH; 
COL.LANDA Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what has befallen Germany's most elegant swan? 
BRIDGET Colonel Landa, it's been years. Dashing as ever I see. 
COL.LANDA Flattery will get you everywhere, fraulein. They chuckle, and air kiss. 
COL.LANDA So what's happened to your lovely leg, a by product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt. 
BRIDGET Save your flattery, you old dog. I know too many of your former conquests, to fall into that honey pot. Chuckle-chuckle... 
COL.LANDA Seriously, what happened? 
BRIDGET Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add, at mountain climbing. And this was the result. 
COL.LANDA Mountain climbing? That's how you injured your leg, mountain climbing? 
BRIDGET Believe it or not, yes it is. A brief moment passes between the two... 
THEN... The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious in fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs. The Colonel begins to regain his composure... 
COL.LANDA Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean laugh at your misfortune. It's just .mountain climbing? I'm curious fraulein, what could of ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor? The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress. 
BRIDGET Well, I chant be doing it again, I can tell you that. 
COL.LANDA That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing this mountain, last night? 
BRIDGET Very good eye, Colonel. It happened yesterday morning. 
COL.LANDA Hummm. And where exactly in Paris is this mountain? This stops her for a seconded. Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook. 
COL.LANDA I'm just teasing you, fraulein. You know me, I tease rough. So who are your three handsome escorts? 
BRIDGET I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German. Their friends of mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti. (Meaning Aldo) A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi. (Meaning Donny) And Enzo's camera assistant, Dominick Decocco. The German fraulein turns to the three tuxedo wearing Basterds. 
BRIDGET 
(ITALIAN) Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col. Sans Landa of the S.S. The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is, but they can't show it. 
LT.ALDO 
COL.LANDA Margheriti...? 
(ITALIAN) Am I saying it correctly...? .Margheriti? 
LT. ALDO 
(ITALIAN) Yes. Correct. 
COL.LANDA 
(ITALIAN) Margheriti.... Say it for me once please...? 
LT. ALDO Margheriti. 
13ZÃ¢â¬Â¢ 
COL.LANDA 
(ITALIAN) I'm sorry, again...? 
LT.ALDO I4argheriti. 
COL.LANDA 
(ITALIAN) Once more... .? 
LT.ALDO Margheriti. 
COL.LANDA Nargheriti. 
(FRENCH) It means daisies, I believe. Turning his gaze to Donny. 
COL.LANDA 
(ITALIAN) What's your name again?

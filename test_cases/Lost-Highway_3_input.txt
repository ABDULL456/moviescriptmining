The Warden stands up and comes around the desk. 
WARDEN I want to take a look at this man myself. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - INFIRMARY - DAY 
The man from Fred's cell is just finishing being fingerprinted. 
The doctor with serious eyebrows - DR. ROGOFF - is inspecting the man's face.  The Warden enters with Captain Henderson. GUARDS are standing by the door and at strategic spots in the room. 
WARDEN What is this, Rogoff? 
DR. ROGOFF I don't know yet. 
Dr. Rogoff begins to draw blood from the man's arm. He takes several vials.  The man watches the blood coming out of his arm, but doesn't seem to understand where he is or what is happening to him. 
WARDEN Who is this man? 
DR. ROGOFF He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away.  We'll find out soon enough. 
Dr. Rogoff opens the man's mouth and peers in with a pencil light. 
WARDEN He's not Madison? 
DR. ROGOFF (slowly, deliberately Not even close. 
Dr. Rogoff stands up, puts the light in his breast pocket. 
DR. ROGOFF (CON'T) I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache. 
WARDEN A headache? 
DR. ROGOFF I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill.  I've never seen this man before.  Neither have the guards.  I don't think he's in the system. 
The Warden moves closer to the man - he looks closely at him. 
WARDEN Where the hell did you come from, mister? 
CLOSE UP OF THE MAN - he's staring straight up. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Present are the Warden, Captain Henderson and TWO other PRISON OFFICIALS.  The Warden is looking at a computer next to his desk. 
WARDEN Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday is April 21st.  He was born and raised right here.  He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five (MORE) 
WARDEN (cont'd) years ago for auto theft, for which he was put on probation for one year.  That was his first and only offense.  No record since then. 
Warden Clements looks up, takes a deep breath and stares at the men in front of him. 
WARDEN (CON-T) How about Madison?  Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts? 
CAPTAIN HENDERSON Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed nationwide. 
PRISON OFFICIAL #1 I had a call from the governor's office about this. 
WARDEN How the hell does she know? 
PRISON OFFICIAL #1 There's press outside right now. 
WARDEN How the hell... 7 
CAPTAIN HENDERSON One of the guards must have leaked it. 
WARDEN What's the word on the street? 
PRISON OFFICIAL #2 Only that Madison has apparently escaped. Nothing about the other guy. 
WARDEN Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid on Dayton.  Nothing gets out about him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - DAY 
Johnny Mack walks down the row and enters Fred's cell. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - DAY 
Johnny Mack looks around, up and down the walls, half peers under the cot, then - checking first to see no other guard is watching him - he looks inside the toilet bowl, then gets down on his knees and really looks under the cot.  He gets up and sits down on the bed.  He rubs a hand over his face. Johnny Mack is clearly perplexed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - MEDIA ROOM - DAY 
A press conference is being held.  Present are REPORTERS, TV cameras, et al.  The Warden and Captain Henderson represent the prison.

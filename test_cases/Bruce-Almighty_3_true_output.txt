Hood #2 is instantly tackled by THREE BRUGES -- ONE BRUCE kneels down behind a hood, ANOTHER BRUCE pushes him down over his back. The two Bruce's high-five -- A Hood climbs a fire escape. ONE BRUCE gives a hand up to ANOTHER BRUCE, who takes pursuit. ANOTHER BRUCE leans out of a window SMASHES a potted plant over his head -- ON THE MONKEY - SCREECHING, ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT 
Our Bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily watching the mayhem. HOOD #2 Let's get out of here, manl Hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow. BRUCE Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body. BRUCE I'll take it from here. Bruce takes a deep breath, OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE, RELEASING A SWARM OF LOCUSTS -- 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
The gang streams out of the alley screaming, COVERED IN LOCUSTS. Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his side.        He looks down to the monkey. BRUCE Back home for you, little one. The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see HOOD #1 stumbling to his feet. HOOD #1 NoI   NOOOOO1 He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit. ON BRUCE He belches and one last locust flies out.      He reacts to the unpleasant aftertaste and walks off. CUT TO: CLOSE ON - BRUCE 
We widen to an UP ANGLE of him standing on the top of Buffalo's tallest SKYSCRAPER. Clouds swirl behind him. He looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and proclaims to the world. BRUCE I AM THE LORD THY BRUCE ALMIGHTY. MY WILL BE DONE I Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes behind him. He is an awesome god. INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box of photos working on the album. She takes a sip of wine, sets down the glass. Sam walks over and laps up the wine. GRACE (to Sam) Well, at least I have someone to drink with. Grace hears Bruce coming up the stairs, singing.

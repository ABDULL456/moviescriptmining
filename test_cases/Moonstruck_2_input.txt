Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument goes on. 
SHEILA'S VOICE I really do hate it though, when you take that tone with me. Like you're above it all and isn't it amusing. 
MAN'S VOICE But it is, isn't it? 
SHEILA'S VOICE Not to me! This is my life, no matter how damned comical it may seem to you. I don't need some man standing above the struggle while I roll around in the mud! 
MAN'S VOICE I think you like the mud and I don't. That's fair, isn't it? If I don't care to... 
Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds. 
When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his 50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables. 
PERRY Sorry about that, folks. She's a very pretty mental patient. 
The Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself. 
PERRY Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka? 
SHY WAITER Absolutely! 
The Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry notices Rose. 
They are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now. 
PERRY I'm sorry if we disturbed you. 
ROSE I'm not disturbed. By you. 
PERRY My lady friend has a personality disorder. 
ROSE She was just too young for you. 
The Shy Waiter serves Perry his drink. 
PERRY (to the Waiter) Thanks, comrade. 
SHY WAITER It's nothing! 
The Shy Waiter goes. 
PERRY (Rose's comment strikes home) Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you? 
ROSE None of your business. 
He drops his posturing. 
PERRY Sorry. That was rude. 
ROSE Will you join me for dinner? 
PERRY Are you sure? 
She nods. 
PERRY Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that. 
ROSE AND PERRY ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR DINNER 
ROSE What do you do? 
PERRY I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U. 
ROSE That woman was a student of yours? 
PERRY Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was. 
ROSE There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it? 
PERRY Yes. 
ROSE Don't shit where you eat. 
PERRY (taken aback, then recovering) I'll remember that. What do you do? 
ROSE I'm a housewife. 
PERRY Then why are you eating alone?

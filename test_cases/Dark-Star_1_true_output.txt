He pulls on a pair of insulated gloves and approaches a heavy freezer door.  On the door is a sign: 
CRYOGENIC FREEZER COMPARTMENT 
CAUTION 
ABSOLUTE ZERO 
He opens the door. 
COMMANDER POWELL is encased in the freezer in a post-death, frozen ammonia state.  Wire and electrodes are attached to his head. 
Doolittle takes a microphone from a console on the freezer.  He flips a switch and speaks into the mike: 
DOOLITTLE Commander Powell?  Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.  Can you read me? 
A crackle of static comes from a speaker grille, along with the FAINT MUTTERING OF COMMANDER POWELL'S VOICE: 
POWELL ... muffirup glurrinpinfropal... 
Doolittle fiddles with the volume control, trying to bring Commander Powell's voice into audibllity. 
DOOLITTLE Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something. 
POWELL (very weakly) I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle.  It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me. 
DOOLITTLE Commander, sir, we have a big problem.  You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck.  It won't drop from the bomb bay.  It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in -- (checks watch) -- less than eleven minutes.

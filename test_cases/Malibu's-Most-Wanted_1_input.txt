17   CONTINUED: (A1)                                           17 GLADYS All the time, baby. Most folks only feel comfortable around folks who are the same as them. When they meet someone different, they get scared and angry, wanna keep 'em down. (CONTINUED) 
17   CONTINUED:                                                      17 BRAD What do you do about it? GLADYS Nothin' to do but keep it real. Be proud of who you are. BRAD Yeah, you right... Gladys, when they gonna leave our people alone? GLADYS (emotional) I don't know, baby, I just don't know... (notices Brad's plate) Eat your greens before they get cold, boy. A PAGER GOES OFF. Brad searches his pockets, pulls out a pager -- that's not it; pulls out another pager -- that's not it either; pulls out a two-way -- that's the one. BRAD (reading pager) Oh no, not again! He gets up and runs out of the room. CUT TO: 
18   INT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - WAR ROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)         18 Bill, Tom, the staff, and several AIDES of varying ethnicity are mid-meeting. TOM How'd it go with Feldman? BILL Great news. If he sees Brad five days a week, he says we'll see improvement in three to four years. JEN But... the election's in two months. BILL Right, good point. (CONTINUED) 
18   CONTINUED:                                                      18 TOM We've been brainstorming on some different approaches, and I think we may have something solid here. BILL I'm all ears. TOM Guys? The team gathers around -- it's a gang pitch. BRETT Brad might act 'ghetto,' but let's face it, he's never been east of Beverly Hills. JEN But what if we give him a little dose of reality? GARY Let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto. BILL You mean, have Brad actually... go there? TOM Exactly. BILL Sounds dangerous... 
BRETT It'll be perfectly safe. BILL How does it work? JEN We hire actors to play gangsters. TOM They car-jack Brad,     then take him on a 'tour' of the     'hood... give him a little taste     of what thug life's really like.      It might just scare the black out     of him. (CONTINUED) 
18   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              18 Tom gets strange looks from everyone. AFRICAN-AMERICAN AIDE Excuse me? TOM Look, I'm as down as the next brother, guy... fellah. I grew up in Compton, okay? But let's get over the P.C. thing and face facts. Unless we do something soon, Brad's gonna cost us this election. 
The team all nods. BILL I don't know... it sounds so drastic. TOM Maybe drastic is what Brad needs, Bill. He is twenty-four. I mean, what's he gonna do for a living, rap? They all chuckle.     Bill sighs. BILL Who do we get for the gangsters? TOM Remember the anti-crime spot we shot last month? GARY We've got it cued up. They turn to the TV and Gary hits PLAY. On the monitor:     A Gluckman campaign ad plays.

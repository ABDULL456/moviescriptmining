Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed. \nA banner over the rostrum says: \"CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND AID FOUNDATION\" \nKimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly sets on another waiter's passing tray. \nROBERTS (V.O.) Richard... \nDR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars. \nROBERTS Cancun. Nat just talked everybody into it... \nA hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks. \nKIMBLE So, what's the deal? If the hospital buys ten new - \nNAT No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. Kimble.

(to bartender) Tonic water with lime. \nEveryone agrees. \nKIMBLE Never get me to sell my soul for one of those trips... \nHis tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink. \nKIMBLE (to Nat) ...

I can pick my cruise wardrobe. \nRICHARD It's for a good cause, Kath... Besides you need to get out of the lab more. Your electron microscope is starting to give you a tan. \nShe smiles. He moves on. \nANGLE - PARTY \nKimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend... \nKIMBLE Hey, Jim. \nDR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary. \nNICHOLS Richard, I just saw someone who wanted to meet you... \nJust then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble catch a look and hold it. \nNICHOLS (V.O.) Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex is working on the RDU90 trials for Devlin-Macgregor. \nKimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, smiling. Lentz extends his hand... \nLENTZ Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been trading phone calls last few days ... something about a biopsy report I returned to you? \nKIMBLE (suddenly attentive) Yeah... Three. Livers appeared hepatetic to me. \nLENTZ I'll be in my office in the morning and I'll pull up the samples.

I mean, she was worth quite a bit of money. \nBACK TO SCENE \nKimble looks up at the two cops. For the first time he seems to sense something aggressive in their questioning. \nThey no longer seem on the same team. \nKIMBLE What's going on here? This guy was trying to rob us. \nThe two cops stare at Kimble. \nKIMBLE You guys have got to be out of your minds. I didn't kill my wife! \nHe gets up to go. A cop blocks his path.

Another attorney, RANDOLPH, watches Gutherie. \nGUTHERIE ... We can't find this guy. \nKIMBLE I know what I saw, Walter. \nGUTHERIE I put you up on the stand to say what you saw without anything that remotely smells like proof and the State's attorney is going to take this one-armed man story and run it up our ass.

Illinois penal regulations require a meal for transport rides of four hours or more. \nYoung Guard shakes his head. \"Fucking jailhouse lawyers.\" Checks his watch: 4:00. \nYOUNG GUARD Jack! Feedin' time. \nOld Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker. \nPRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the aisle... \nPRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp plastic shank. \nHeart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank. \nCOPELAND Breathe, and you're first. \nOld Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun carelessly ready. \nYoung Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble doesn't respond. \nYOUNG GUARD Suit yourself. \nHe offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it. \nUp front, Old Guard yawns again just as... \nKIMBLE Look out! \nToo late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into Young Guard's gut. \nPrisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes out, Young Guard gets a hand on it.

Rising between the seats. \nA hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head. \nYoung Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to find Kimble. \nOLD GUARD (to Kimble) You. You're a doctor. C'mere. \nHe slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard. \nEXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT \nNews and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators. \nTwo American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. marshals emerge: \nBIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick shithouse. \nRENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds fully-equipped. \nPOOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during nut-cuttin' time. \nNEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5. \nFrom the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media spectacle. \nGERARD Good lord... \nREFRO What is this... a circus? \nAs a group they begin moving along the service road above the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials. \nBiggs spots something... \nBIGGS Point of impact. \n... and branches off. \nGERARD Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman. \nBIGGS Shit. (to Newman) Come on. \nThey drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain with Gerard. \nA state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he sees Gerard's Marshall star. \nGERARD How ya doing? Who's in charge? \nTROOPER Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the lights - \nGerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him. \nRenfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's about to happen. \nANGLE - OLD GUARD \nSeated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the b.g., listening. \nOLD GUARD ... train was bearin' down on us, fast. I don't know how - it's still kind of hazy - but I grabbed him and pushed him out of the bus. \nSHERIFF You coulda both been killed. \nOLD GUARD I know, but hell, he's my partner. Woulda done the same for me. \nThe young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts. \nGERARD Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard. \nSHERIFF (annoyed) I'll be with you in a minute. \nThe television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos of all four prisoners. \nSHERIFF (to Old Guard) For the record. These three dead. And this one... \nHe switches to a photo of Kimble. \nOLD GUARD Well, everything happened so fast... (bites lip, decides) Huh-uh. Don't think he made it. \nSheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others. \nSHERIFF You get some rest. \nHe pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard. \nSHERIFF Looks like you came a long way for nothing. My men've already done a thorough search from point of impact and found nothing. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nANGLE - CULVERT \nBiggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees something. He orders Newman into the muck after it. \nGERARD \nAware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff. \nGERARD With all due respect, may I suggest check-points starting at a 15-mile radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east of - \nSHERIFF Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? Prisoners are all dead. The only thing check-points will do is get a lot of good people out here frantic and flood my office with calls. \nGerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and we get our first taste of Gerard at close range. \nGERARD (beat) Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for that to happen... So, I'll be taking over the investigation. \nSHERIFF On whose authority? \nGERARD By authority of the Governor of the State of Illinois and the office of the United States Marshal, 5th District Northern Illinois... \nPoole produces State and Federal authorization documents from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff. \nSHERIFF (back-down beat) Okay. You want jurisdiction over this mess, you got it. (to assistants) Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to mop up for us. \nHe slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud. \nSeeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard. \nGERARD Please, ladies and gentlemen, step back and give this poor man some room. \nLike an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a change of story and command. \nGerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near. \nGERARD (friendly, to Old Guard) Always an interesting thing when we find leg irons and no legs in them who held the keys, sir? \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Mr. Patterson, do you need some more water? \nANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST \nThe Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed. \nDUTY NURSE ... Oh, you did a good job on this. \nShe takes his empty plastic pitcher and... \n... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and refills the pitcher from the sink. \nDUTY NURSE (over her shoulder, to patient) ... It does get dry in here, doesn't it? \nShe doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY \nKimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts down the corridor toward Kimble. \nThe Trooper looks up as the two men pass... \nTROOPER 'Scuse me, Doc?... \nKimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. doors behind him. \nTROOPER ... Don't know if you heard or not but we're looking for an escaped prisoner from that bus train wreck 'couple hours ago. Thought he might show up here if he was hurt. \nKIMBLE What's he look like? \nThe Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down Kimble's cheek. \nTROOPER (from fax sheet) Approximately six one, 180 pounds, brown hair, brown eyes and beard. \nAt the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes it clean as the Trooper looks up. \nTROOPER ... Seen anyone that fits that description? \nKIMBLE Every time I look in the mirror ... but without the beard. \nThey laugh. \nKIMBLE Excuse me... \nTROOPER Sure. \nKimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks outside... \nEXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY \nTwo PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney.

The guy's fish food. \nGerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain. \nGERARD Then find me the fish that ate him. \nHe turns and heads to a waiting helicopter. \nEXT.

KIMBLE'S OLD HOUSE - DAY \nGerard walks through Kimble's house. The art and most of the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces of furniture. \nGerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it. \nINT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY \nKimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation leaves, locker numbers.

JANITOR'S LOCKER ROOM - CLOSE ON LOCKER - DAY \nDoor opens revealing the janitor's clip on I.D. hanging from a green shirt. Kimble steals it. \nINT.

A large woman with glasses. She stands with a partially finished prosthetic arm. \nMEMORY HIT - INT. KIMBLE'S OLD HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe one-armed man's arm coming off in the fight. \nINT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC (BACK TO PRESENT) \nTECHNICIAN Sorry, I thought you were Ricky. \nKIMBLE (stumbling) No... I've got to clean the blinds in the office. Want me to wait till you're finished? \nTECHNICIAN Naw... I'm going to be here all night. You won't bother me. \nShe slips on a pair of headphones and goes back to work. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC OFFICE - LATER \nKimble cleaning the blinds, keeps an eye on the Technician who is listening to music on her Walkman. She is carefully painting a section of the arm. Not watching Kimble. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON FILE DRAWER \nOpened. \nBACK TO SCENE \nNimble looks over his shoulder. The Technician doesn't see him. \nA Prosthetic Clinic Operations Manual is removed from shelf. \nPhotographs of prosthetic arms. Kimble shifts the materials into his clothes, closes his coat and suddenly he stops. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - ANGLE ON ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nKimble waits for the elevator. The folders in his uniform shift and he tries to rearrange them. When he turns back we see Anne Eastman beside him. Her I.D. says: \"ANNE EASTMAN\". She sees him doing the rearranging. \nThe elevator arrives. They step into: \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nAnne moves to the back. Kimble on the other side. \nANNE (WOMAN DOCTOR) Hey, how're you doing? \nKIMBLE Fine. \nANNE You find that sign? \nKIMBLE Yes, I did. \nANNE You called me an asshole. \nKIMBLE Excuse me. I was having a bad shift. \nThey laugh. They reach ground level and step out together. \nANNE You worked at other hospitals? \nKIMBLE Lots of them over the years. Here, long ago. Hasn't changed much. \nANNE I bet it hasn't. See you. \nThey part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops and watches him leave. \nINT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT \nKimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking at his information. \nINT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY \nAfternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking for a key to the identity of the one-armed man. \nFinally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and covers his face. \nDraws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the Prosthetic Clinic material. \nFLASHBACK - FIGHT \nKimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates. \nFLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN \nReacts in pain. Again. (NOTE: We sense Kimble's mind returning to something. Getting closer to the key...) \nFLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN \nEscaping the bedroom. We hear his FOOTSTEPS DOWN the STAIRS... a DOOR SLAM. FOOTSTEPS again. \nAnother DOOR SLAMS, but this time the sound is distinctly different... a CAR DOOR. \nINT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM (BACK TO PRESENT) \nKimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert. Listening, he hears: FOOTSTEPS are real, just outside and MOVING TOWARD him. \nHARD CUT TO: \nEXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY \nA car door slams. We see unmarked police cars pulling up in front of the apartment. Cops are moving toward the house. \nINT. BASEMENT - DAY \nKimble turns off his light, moves from the bed to the window. Carefully looks out: \nKIMBLE'S POV \nA Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the gurney. \nKIMBLE They just sent this one up. \nHe takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and yells to O.R. nurse. \nSURGEON Bob! Get this one into room four, stat. \nHe looks up, Kimble is gone. \nINT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT \nKimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room. The Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman, sees Kimble and waves. Kimble waves back and turns into the glass-walled computer room and closes the door. \nHe closes the blinds and turns on the computer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRITICAL CARE UNIT - NIGHT \nThe crisis has wound down. Anne moves into the room and begins checking patients. She stops a unit nurse, GLADYS. \nANNE Gladys, where's the boy I sent down with the janitor? \nGLADYS What boy? \nANNE The one with the fractured sternum. \nGLADYS He never came in here. \nINT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT \nKimble scans DOS files, each an eight-letter enigma. Finds one with promise and loads it up. \nKIMBLE Wrong... \nHe backs up and tries another file. \n\"CLIENT DEMOGRAPHIC ORGANIZER SEARCH BY: AGE, SEX, RACE, LIMB, OR OTHER?\" \nKimble knows he's got it. \nINT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT \nKimble keys in these responses: \n\"SEX: MALE\" AGE: 35-50 RACE: CAUCASIAN LIMB: RIGHT ARM OTHER: POINT OF REPLACEMENT: MID HUMERUS\" \nINT.

(handing her the chart) Anne, did you write the orders? I couldn't make out the signature... \nANNE I saw - \nSURGEON (in a hurry now) Whoever did knew what the hell he was doing. Kid's a hair away from a ruptured aorta. \nHe heads to the operating room, leaving her stunned. She stares at the scrawled orders. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT \nA \"PLEASE WAIT\" message appears on the screen. We hear the COMPUTER PROCESSING, searching, narrowing. \nThe screen flashes: \n\"NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CANDIDATES: 75 DO YOU WISH TO SUBDIVIDE?\" \nKIMBLE Seventy-five. Hell, yes. \nKimble types in another defining characteristic... Residence: Illinois. \nAgain he waits. Rattles the blinds to make it seem like he's cleaning.

This is Ted Riley with the high school reunion committee. Believe it or not, 25 years is just around the corner, and Clive's on our list of lost souls. Information gave me a number, but when I tried it... \nWIDER to reveal Kimble on the pay phone. The scrap of paper is his list-of-five. \nKIMBLE No kidding?... Armed robbery. (forced laughter) He's where? \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nGerard looks at the screen. The number drops to 20. \nRENFRO It could take us a week to track down every one of those names. \nGerard picks up phone and dials a number. \nGERARD (into phone) Stevens... I've got a list of names I want searched for criminal history. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY \nKimble stands on a sidewalk, staring at the imposing edifice across the street. After a here-we-go breath, he starts through traffic. \nINT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY \nKimble waits for an elevator. It opens to reveal a pack of staring COPS. \nELEVATOR COP (catching door) Comin' or not? \nForcing his feet to move, Kimble boards... \nINT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - ELEVATOR - DAY \n... and pivots quickly. Elevator rises. Floor-indicator moves deathly slow. \nKimble feels the breath of a dozen COPS on his neck. And just when his floor is mercifully about to arrive... \nOverhead lights flicker, and the elevator jars to a stop between floors. \nCOPS Aw, shit... Not now... Anybody bring a deck of cards? \nAbruptly they're moving again. Kimble's heart restarts with the elevator. \nINT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - VISITATION AREA - DAY \nCLEARING OFFICER (to visitor) Booth Three.

FEDERAL LOCKUP - MAIN LOBBY - DAY \nGerard and Biggs cross the lobby and stop in front of the desk; flash their U.S. Marshal's ID. \nGERARD (to clerk) We need to see a prisoner. \nDESK CLERK Fifth floor. \nKimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds. \nPeople stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors begin closing. Biggs pushes his way off the elevator. Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door. \nGERARD \nBursts out the stairwell door after Kimble. \nGERARD Kimble. Stop! \nBut there's only one way of stopping Kimble. \nKIMBLE \nEnters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door - trapping him partially inside the revolving door. \nOther doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees Gerard. \nKimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd, shoves a man out of his line of fire. \nGERARD Down. down. everybody down! \nWith adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the opening... \nEXT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY \n... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks back over his shoulder at... \nGerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim. \nGERARD Kimble. Stop! \nIt's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as \nINT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY \nGerard FIRES seven times in two seconds. \nKimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with bullet holes, he sees... \nKimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's alive. He runs free. \nGERARD Open the doors! \nGerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble rush across the street and disappear into the parade. \nDoors open and Gerard and his men follow. \nBut Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations outside. Blending in with the marchers. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOTEL - MORNING \nKimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning. He wears a new set of clothes - jeans, sport coat and tie - than the day before, and the black hair coloring has been rinsed from his hair. He moves down the street. \nINT. BAR - MORNING \nKimble uses a pay phone and stares through the window. \nKIMBLE'S POV - APARTMENT HOUSE \nAcross the street. \nINT. SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING \nInside the apartment the PHONE RINGS. No one is home. \nINT. BAR - MORNING \nThe PHONE RINGS nine, ten times. As Kimble waits he looks down at his list of five. The only name remaining is Fredrick Sykes. \nHe looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans across the seat and opens the door for him. \nHe hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a handgun. \nKimble hangs up and leaves through the back door. \nEXT. REAR OF SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING \nKimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS. \nINT. SYKES' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING \nNo sound. Slowly he moves into... \nHALLWAY \nMoving first toward the living room. The apartment is modest. \nHe stops by a photograph of a teenage girl. Another is a boy in football uniform. The next one is a man in a police uniform. Kimble freezes. \nMEMORY HIT - INT. KIMBLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT OF MURDER \nKimble struggles with the one-armed man. \nINT. SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING (PRESENT) \nKimble struggles to recall the man's face. It could be him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT - MORNING \nKimble searching for clues to Sykes' identity. He opens closets, wardrobe, bureau... reopens a drawer. There, in the bottom he finds an old prosthetic arm. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE - DESK \nKimble looking through Sykes' desk drawers finds a package of photographs. He opens them and quickly flips through. \nINSERT - PHOTOGRAPHS \nGERARD (into phone) You can't control this thing, Kimble... Kimble? \nHe thinks he hears FOOTSTEPS over the phone, realizes Kimble has not hung up. What's Kimble doing? \nGERARD (to Renfro) Where is he? \nRenfro looks up from the address to Gerard, stunned. \nRENFRO (incredulous) Holy shit. We've got a car there right now. \nHe picks up a phone. \nEXT. SYKES' APARTMENT - ANGLE - POLICE CAR - MORNING \nThe two cops receive a radio report about Kimble and quickly exit their car. They rush toward Sykes' building. \nANGLE - BACK ALLEY \nWhile they move into the apartment, we see Kimble, fully aware of them, slip away down the alley. \nINT. EL TRAIN - MORNING \nCLOSE ON LIST: Sykes. Lentz. Devlin-MacGregor. R.D.U.90. Lines draw connections. \nMEMORY HIT - INT.

We WIDEN to find: Gerard. We see technicians dusting room for prints. A FORENSIC TECH approaches Gerard. \nFORENSIC TECH Inspector, we're ready for you to look at this. \nThe Forensic Tech sits at desk. \nFORENSIC TECH Kimble's prints are all over the apartment, but the concentration is here. \nThe Tech takes out the check stubs, some papers; the pack of photos. \nINSERT - PHOTOS \nThe Tech flips through the pack, stops on the Lentz/Sykes photos. \nFORENSIC TECH He flips through the pack but paused here. \nHe hands the Lentz/Sykes photo. \nGERARD Let me see the negatives. \nThe Tech hands him the strip of negative film. Gerard holds it up to the light. \nGERARD One's missing. \nGerard stares at the photo as his RADIO SQUAWKS. \nBIGGS (V.O.) (on radio) Here he comes... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SYKES' APARTMENT - SIDEWALK - DAY \nFredrick Sykes, the one-armed man, comes down the side walk. He passes a car and hears the door open behind him. Biggs climbs out of the car and falls into step behind him. \nSykes hears the footsteps but moves on up the stoop and starts to enter his apartment, notices the front door already open. \nCops and Marshals in his house. Processing a crime scene. \nSYKES What the hell's going on here? Who are you people? \nHe steps... \nINT. SYKES' APARTMENT - DAY \n... sees Gerard in the kitchen. Gerard stares at Sykes. \nGERARD You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes. \nSYKES You a cop? \nGERARD My name is Gerard. U.S. Marshal's Office. \nSykes is caught off guard. \nGERARD This morning a fugitive named Richard Kimble made a call from your apartment. \nSykes is dumbfounded. \nSYKES Richard Kimble... I don't know a Richard Kim - \nPoole produces a photo of Kimble. \nSYKES Wait a minute... This is the doctor who killed his wife... He claimed the killer had a prosthetic limb. You telling me he's coming after me? \nGERARD Would he have a reason to? \nSYKES What the hell's that supposed to mean? Because I have this? \nHe lifts his prosthetic arm and stares at Gerard. Gerard holds his look. \nSYKES Look, a year ago some people came to see me. They asked me questions about the night of the murder and I'll tell you the same thing I told them. I wasn't even in town then. I was on a business trip. \nGerard continues moving around the apartment. \nThe group of deputies and Gerard assemble around Gerard's information board. They've come armed with facts and theories. Gerard orchestrates the information. \nRENFRO If you were Richard Kimble... Why would you hunt for a one-armed man you think killed your wife; find hint then leave him and call us? \nPOOLE To throw us off his trail. \nRENFRO Unless... What if you were a well respected surgeon and wanted to kill your wife? How would you do it? \nBIGGS I'd hire a pro. Sight unseen. \nPOOLE Set it up to look like a robbery gone bad. \nRENFRO How would you find him? Look in the phone book? \nRENFRO Through a connection. \nPOOLE Maybe through a company you did some business with. \nBIGGS Like a pharmaceutical company. Someone in security. \nNEWMAN On the night of his wife's murder, Kimble attended a hospital benefit sponsored by Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceutical - Sykes' company. \nGerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board. \nBIGGS But Sykes claims he was out of town. \nPOOLE And company records support that he was on a business trip. \nRENFRO That's an easy fix. So let's say he was in town. Did the job. Everything goes as planned with one problem. \nNEWMAN Instead of looking like a robbery gone bad, Kimble ends up being the one accused... \nBIGGS ... tried, convicted... \nPOOLE ... and the hit man gets away clean. \nRENFRO So Kimble returns to hunt for and find the hit man. \nNEWMAN Why? To share the blame? He'd still go to prison. \nGerard moves to the board. He takes down a card. \nRENFRO You're underestimating the power of the good doctor. It would be his word against... Sykes'. Who would you believe? \nBIGGS So what does Kimble do next? \nRENFRO Get help. \nGerard pins the card to the board and looks at Renfro. It says: \"NICHOLS\" \nGERARD Stevens, check phone records for Sykes and Kimble. \nGerard moves to the door and Renfro follows. As he's leaving he hands the photo of Lentz and Sykes to Biggs. \nGERARD Find out who this guy is. \nHe leaves. Biggs hands the photo to Newman. \nNEWMAN (deadpan) Why do I get all the great jobs? \nEXT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - DAY \nKimble enters the hospital through the loading dock. \nINT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL - MORGUE - DAY \nMR. ROOSEVELT, an ancient research assistant, opens the door to Kimble. \nROOSEVELT It sure is good to see you again, Dr. Kimble. \nKIMBLE You too, Roosevelt...

WAHLUND'S LAB - DAY \nKimble moves down hall and quietly enters a small research lab in the university.

And starts down a hall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL MORGUE HALLWAY - DAY \nNewman and Biggs move down the empty hallway... this long shot has never felt longer. They find the morgue. \nBIGGS Just what I want to do before dinner. \nINT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL MORGUE - DAY \nRoosevelt working near the autopsy tables when the two marshals enter. \nNEWMAN Are you Mr. Roosevelt? \nROOSEVELT Yes. \nBIGGS We're United States Marshals. We're trying to find out some information about a pathologist, named Lentz. He used to be on staff here. \nRoosevelt suddenly goes on the defensive. \nROOSEVELT He's dead. \nNEWMAN Yeah, we heard. We wanted to know if he knew or had any contact with Dr. Richard Kimble? \nOn the mention of Kimble, Roosevelt becomes visibly nervous. \nROOSEVELT I... I haven't seen Dr. Kimble. \nBiggs and Newman exchange a look. \nNEWMAN (a probe) That's not what I asked, sir. I just wanted to know if Dr. Kimble and Dr. Lentz knew each other? \nROOSEVELT I... I don't know. Excuse me, I got to go. \nHe moves away from the autopsy table. Biggs stops him. \nBIGGS I think you're lying to us. \nRoosevelt looks from one marshal to the other as we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL - DR. WAHLUND'S LAB - AFTERNOON \nAs Kathy packs up evidence, Kimble looks through the reports. \nKIMBLE They'd be home free if I hadn't been leaning on them to account for the livers I was seeing. And I wouldn't have seen the livers if I hadn't told the guys on my service to call me when they had cases that were bleeding excessively in surgery. \nWAHLUND Big bucks. One schmuck standing in the way. Easy, get rid of him and his wife. But why Lentz? \nKIMBLE Why not? He's one of the original patent holders. Toss the samples I sent, replace them with healthy samples, issue the path report on the healthy stuff-piece of cake. \nKimble notices something in the report. \nKIMBLE When did Lentz die? \nWAHLUND Oh, last summer sometime. August... Why? \nKimble looks up from the protocol report. \nKIMBLE Because a good third of the samples Lentz approved were signed after he died. \nKathy comes to look at the report. Lentz's signature is on reports dated October, November, December. \nKIMBLE Someone else used Lentz's name. \nWAHLUND A pathologist at Devlin-Macgregor? \nKIMBLE They wouldn't have had the access. They would have needed someone at the hospital. \nKimble opens the Devlin-Macgregor prospectus he took from the medical library and opens it to the beginning. A photo gets his attention. \nHe takes the bag and starts for the door. \nWAHLUND Where are you going? \nKIMBLE To see an old friend. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GERARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nGerard at his board.

You don't have it in you . \nFor a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost unconscious. \nKimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead. \nKimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the Cop's belt.

{"train": "FARGO \nFARGO a screenplay by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen \nThe following text fades in over black: \nThis is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occured. \nFLARE TO WHITE \nFADE IN FROM WHITE \nSlowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white particles wave over a white background.  A snowfall. \nA car bursts through the curtain of snow. \nThe car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car, a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales sticker showing in its rear window. \nAs the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft, the title of the film fades in. \nFARGO \nGreen highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD, MINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities diverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another just after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412. \nThe car pulls into a Rodeway Inn. \nHOTEL LOBBY \nA man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch, goes to the reception desk.  The clerk is an older woman. \nCLERK And how are you today, sir? \nMAN Real good now.  I'm checking in - Mr. Anderson. \nThe man prints \"Jerry Lundega\" onto a registration card, then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print \"Anderson.\" \nAs she types into a computer: \nCLERK Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're still planning on staying with us just the night, then? \nANDERSON You bet. \nHOTEL ROOM \nThe man turns on the TV, which shows the local evening news. \nNEWS ANCHOR - whether they will go to summer camp at all.  Katie Jensen has more. \nKATIE It was supposed to be a project funded by the city council;  it was supposed to benefit those Fargo-Moorehead children who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend a lakeshore summer camp.  But nobody consulted city controller Stu Jacobson... \nCHAIN RESTAURANT \nAnderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner.  Muzak plays.  A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other. \nWAITRESS Can I warm that up for ya there? \nANDERSON You bet. \nThe man looks at his watch. \nTHROUGH A WINDSHIELD \nWe are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story brick building.  Broken neon at the top of the building identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in neon, holds a champagne glass aloft. \nINSIDE \nThe bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music plays on the jukebox. \nTwo men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short, slight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and dour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty long-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full. \nAnderson approaches. \nANDERSON I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard - \nYOUNGER MAN You're Jerry Lundegaard? \nJERRY Yah, Shep Proudfoot said - \nYOUNGER MAN Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man? \nSALESMAN You bet. \nJERRY You wouldn't have an extra ticket there? \nSALESMAN They're playin' the Buckeyes! \nJERRY Yah. \nSALESMAN Ya kiddin'! \nJERRY'S CUBICLE \nJerry re-enters. \nJERRY Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat. \nCUSTOMER One hundred!  You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're a bald-faced liar! \nJerry sits staring at his lap. \nCUSTOMER ...  A fucking liar - \nWIFE Bucky, please! \nJerry mumbles into his lap: \nJERRY One hunnert's the best we can do here. \nCUSTOMER Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook.  Let's get this over with. \nWIDE EXTERIOR:  TRUCK STOP \nThere is a restaurant with many big rigs parked nearby, and a motel with an outsize Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox flanking its sign:  BLUE OX MOTEL. \nMOTEL ROOM \nCarl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in the twin beds having sex with two truck-stop hookers. \nCARL Oh, Jesus, yeah. \nHIS HOOKER There ya go, sugar. \nGRIMSRUD Nnph. \nHIS HOOKER Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. \nLATER \nThe couples like in their respective beds, gazing at the offscreen TV. \nED MCMAHON -  Johnny's guests tonight will be Lee Majors, George Wendt, and Steve Boutsikaros from the San Diego Zoo, so keep that dial - \nLUNDEGAARD KITCHEN \nWe hear a morning show on television.  Jean Lundegaard is making coffee in the kitchen as Scott eats cereal at the table. \nJEAN I'm talkin' about your potential. \nSCOTT (absently) Uh-huh. \nJEAN You're not a C student. \nSCOTT Uhn. \nJEAN And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me. \nSCOTT Uh-huh. \nJEAN You know what a disparity is? \nSCOTT (testily) Yeah! \nJEAN Okay.  Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey. \nSCOTT Oh, man! \nThe phone rings. \nSCOTT ...  What's the big deal?  It's an hour - \nJERRY Carl somethin'? \nSHEP Never heard of him.  Don't vouch for him. \nJERRY Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'.  I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see - \nSHEP Call 'em up. \nJERRY Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya. \nSHEP Nope. \nJerry slaps his fist into his open palm and snaps his fingers. \nJERRY Okay, well, real good, then. \nCAR \nCarl is driving.  Grimsrud stares out front. \nAfter a beat: \nCARL ...  Look at that.  Twin Cities. IDS Building, the big glass one. Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest. After the Sears, uh, Chicago... You never been to Minneapolis? \nGRIMSRUD No. \nCARL ...  Would it kill you to say something? \nGRIMSRUD I did. \nCARL \"No.\" First thing you've said in the last four hours.  That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man.  That's a geyser.  I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man.  Shit, I'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation. \nGrimsurd smokes, gazing out the window. \nCARL ...  Well, fuck it, I don't have to talk either, man.  See how you like it... \nHe drives. \nCARL ...  Total silence... \nJERRY'S CUBICLE \nHe is on the phone. \nJERRY Yah, real good.  How you doin'? \nVOICE Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard. You're damned hard to get on the phone. \nJERRY Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it. \nVOICE That's for sure.  Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I - \nJERRY But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the - \nVOICE Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month. \nJERRY Yah, so we're all set. \nVOICE Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your applicaton.  Maybe if you could just read them to me - \nJERRY But the deal's already done, I already got the money - \nVOICE Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist. \nJERRY Yah, well, they exist all right. \nVOICE I'm sure they do - ha ha!  But I can't read their serial numbers here.  So if you could read me - \nJERRY Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy - \nVOICE No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing - \nJERRY Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then. \nVOICE Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money - \nJERRY Yah, how much money was that? \nVOICE Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars.  See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on. \nJean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to the tank. \nThe groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor. \nThe door swings open. \nGrimsrud and Carl enter. \nTHEIR POV \nRoom empty, window open. \nCarl strides to the window and hoists himself out. \nGrimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent. \nHe finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing something in the mirror. \nThe shower curtain is drawn around the tub. \nHe steps toward it. \nAs he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated by thrashing limbs. \nJean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its rings and stumbles out into the bedroom.  Grimsrud follows. \nBEDROOM \nJean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain but awkwardly trying to push it off. \nUPSTAIRS LANDING \nStill thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing, trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the stairs. \nGrimsrud trots down after her. \nA PLAQUE:  WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED \nINT. WADE'S OFFICE \nWade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry enters. \nJERRY How ya doin' there, Stan?  How are ya, Wade? \nStan Grossman shakes his hand. \nSTAN Good to see ya again, Jerry.  If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet. \nJERRY Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee. \nWADE This is do-able. \nSTAN Congratulations, Jerry. \nJERRY Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty - \nWADE What kind of finder's fee were you looking for? \nJERRY ...  Huh? \nSTAN The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee. \nJERRY ...  My fee?  Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about? \nWADE Stan and I're okay. \nJERRY Yah. \nWADE We're good to loan in. \nJERRY Yah. \nWADE But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us. \nJERRY No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in.  It's my deal here, see? \nWade scowls, looks at Stan. \nSTAN Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment. \nJERRY ...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible... \nBeat. \nLIVING ROOM \nJerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a telephone. \nAfter a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in a number. \nJERRY ...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please. \nBLACK \nHold in black. \nA slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large paper-mache figure into frame.  It is a flannel-shirt woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder.  As we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a pedestal. \nA sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal: WELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN. \nThe headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the background.  The two-lane highway is otherwise empty. \nINT. CAR \nCarl drives.  Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window. From the back seat we hear whimpering. \nGrimsrud turns to look. \nJean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a tarpaulin. \nGRIMSRUD Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know. \nCARL Geez.  That's more'n I've heard you say all week. \nGrimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window. \nAt a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear window.  Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on his gumballs. \nCarl eases the car onto the shoulder. \nCARL Ah, shit, the tags... \nGrimsrud looks at him. \nCARL ...  It's just the tags.  I never put my tags on the car.  Don't worry, I'll take care of this. \nHe looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on the gravel shoulder. \nCARL ...  Let's keep still back there, lady, or we're gonna have to, ya know, to shoot ya. \nGrimsrud stares at Carl. \nCARL ...  Hey!  I'll take care of this! \nBoth cars have stopped.  Carl looks up at the rear-view mirror. \nThe trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them, writing in his citation book. \nCarl watches. \nWe hear the trooper's door open. \nThe trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night air. \nCarl opens his window as the trooper draws up. \nCARL How can I help you, officer? \nThe trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time. \nGrimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window. \nFinally: \nTROOPER This is a new car, then, sir? \nCARL It certainly is, officer.  Still got that smell! \nTROOPER You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window. \nGrimsrud notices. \nEXT. ROAD \nThe car approaches, slowing. \nCarl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen in the headlights. \nThe car accelerates and roars past and away.  We just make out the silhouettes of two occupants in front. \nINT. CIERA \nGrimsrud slides into the driver's seat.  He squeals into a U- turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin. \nSmall red tail lights fishtail up ahead.  The pursued car churns up fine snow. \nGrimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in his ashtray.  We hear the churning of the car wheels and the pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside. \nIn the back seat, Jean starts screaming. \nGrimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights. \nHe fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face. \nThe red tail lights ahead start to turn.  With a distant crunching sound, they disappear. \nThe headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn. \nGrimsrud frowns and slows. \nHis headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn. \nGrimsrud brakes. \nJean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell. \nGrimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his door and gets out. \nEXT. ROAD \nThe wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield abutting the highway.  A young man in a down parka is limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car. \nGrimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy.  He raises his gun and fires. \nWith a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back and he pitches into the snow. \nGrimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open door. \nA young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage, injured. \nSnow swirls in the headlights of the wreck. \nGrimsrud raises his gun and fires. \nAN OIL PAINTING \nA blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland.  The room in which it hangs is dark.  We hear off-screen snoring. \nWe track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half- completed oil of a grey mallard. \nThe continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping.  The man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied.  His mouth is agape.  He snores.  His arms are flung over a woman in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not snoring. \nWe hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and snoring. \nThe phone rings. \nThe woman stirs. \nWOMAN Oh, geez... \nShe reaches for the phone. \nWOMAN ...  Hi, it's Marge... \nThe man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble. \nMARGE ...  Oh, my.  Where?...  Yah... Oh, geez... \nThe man sits up, gazes stupidly about. \nWADE Heck, you don't know!  You're just whistlin' Dixie here!  I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this!  I'm sayin' call a professional! \nJERRY No!  No cops!  That's final!  This is my deal here, Wade!  Jean is my wife here! \nSTAN I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here. \nWADE Well - \nSTAN We gotta protect Jean.  These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em.  So they call the shots. \nJERRY You're darned tootin'! \nWADE Ah, dammit! \nSTAN I'm tellin' ya. \nWADE Well...  Why don't we... \nHe saws a finger under his nose. \nWADE ...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million. \nJERRY Now come on here, no way, Wade! No way! \nSTAN We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing. \nJERRY Yah! \nSTAN What's the next step here, Jerry? \nJERRY They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop.  I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow. \nWADE Dammit! \nTHE CASHIER \nShe rings up two dollars forty. \nCASHIER How was everything today? \nJERRY Yah, real good now. \nPARKING LOT \nSnow continues to fall.  Jerry and Stan stand bundled in their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles. Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for Stan. \nSTAN Okay.  We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry.  Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call? \nJERRY No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear. \nSTAN Yah. \nJerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold. \nJERRY Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots. \nSTAN Okay.  And Scotty, is he gonna be all right? \nJERRY Yah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk to him. \nThere is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the Lincoln. \nSTAN We'll call. \nThe Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and fishtails out onto the boulevard. \nSCOTTY'S BEDROOM \nScotty lies on the bed, weeping.  Jerry enters and perches uncomfortably on the edge of his bed. \nJERRY ...  How ya doin' there, Scotty? \nSCOTT Dad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom? \nJERRY It's okay, Scotty.  They're not gonna want to hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see. \nSCOTT What if - what if sumpn goes wrong? \nJERRY No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right. \nLou enters. \nLOU Hiya, Norm, how's the paintin' goin'? \nNORM Not too bad.  You know. \nMARGE How we doin' on that vehicle? \nLOU No motels registered any tan Ciera last night.  But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank. \nMARGE Geez, that's a good lead.  The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35? \nLOU Yah.  Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company. \nMARGE Oh, yah? \nEXT. STRIPPER CLUB \nMarge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot.  Snow drifts down. \nINT. STRIPPER CLUB \nMarge sits talking with two young women at one end of an elevated dance platform.  The club, not yet open for business, is deserted. \nMARGE Where you girls from? \nHOOKER ONE Chaska. \nHOOKER TWO LeSeure.  But I went to high school in White Bear Lake. \nMARGE Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like. \nHOOKER ONE Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking. \nMARGE In what way? \nHOOKER ONE I dunno.  Just funny-looking. \nMARGE Can you be any more specific? \nHOOKER ONE I couldn't really say.  He wasn't circumcised. \nMARGE Was he funny-looking apart from that? \nHOOKER ONE Yah. \nMARGE So you were having sex with the little fella, then? \nHOOKER ONE Uh-huh. \nMARGE Is there anything else you can tell me about him? \nHOOKER ONE No.  Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even. \nMARGE And what about the other fella? \nHOOKER TWO He was a little older.  Looked like the Marlboro man. \nMARGE Yah? \nHOOKER TWO Yah.  Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros. \nMARGE Uh-huh. \nHOOKER TWO A subconscious-type thing. \nMARGE Yah, that can happen. \nHOOKER TWO Yah. \nHOOKER ONE They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities? \nMARGE Oh, yah? \nHOOKER TWO Yah. \nHOOKER ONE Yah.

I hope I dint wake you. \nMARGE No, that's okay. \nMIKE Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainderd, and I saw you on the news there. \nMARGE Yah. \nMIKE I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead?

What the - how's - \nA complementary track shows two rays being pushed along a buffet line, piled high with many foods. \nMARGE AND NORM AT A TABLE \nThey sit next to each other at a long cafateria-style Formica table, silently eating. \nA hip with a hissing walkie-talkie enters frame. \nGARY Hiya, Norm.  How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricasse? \nMARGE Pretty darn good, ya want some? \nGARY No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs? \nNORM Yah, after lunch. \nHe goes back to his food. \nMARGE Whatcha got there? \nGary hands her a flimsy.  Marge takes it with one hand and looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food. \nGARY The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox.  Two to Minneapolis that night. \nMARGE Mm. \nGARY First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence. A Shep Proudfoot. \nMARGE Uh-huh...  A what? \nGARY Shep Proudfoot.  That's a name. \nMARGE Uh-huh. \nGARY Yah. \nMARGE ...  Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then. \nGARY Oh, yah?  Twin Cities? \nNorm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at Marge with mild interest.  He stares for a beat as he finishes chewing, and them swallows and says: \nNORM ...  Oh, yah? \nKITCHEN OF LUNDEGAARD HOUSE \nJerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table. It is night.  The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging fixture.  On the table are the remains of coffee and a cinammon filbert ring. \nWADE Dammit!  I wanna be a part a this thing! \nJERRY No, Wade!  They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone! \nWADE It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care? \nSTAN Wade's got a point there.  I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry. \nJERRY No, no.  See - they, no, see, they only deal with me.  Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous - \nWADE All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up. \nJERRY The heck d'ya mean? \nWADE They want my money, they can deal with me.  Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional. \nHe points at a briefcase. \nWADE ...  There's a million dollars here! \nJERRY No, see - \nWADE Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car.  It's my show here. That's that. \nSTAN It's the way we prefer to handle it, Jerry. \nTHE DOWNTOWN RADISSON HOTEL \nMarge is at the reception desk. \nMARGE How ya doin'? \nMarge and Shep silently talk. \nJerry stares, swallows. \nINSIDE THE CUBICLE \nMARGE - Wednesday night? \nShep is shaking his head. \nSHEP Nope. \nMARGE Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace? \nSHEP Yep. \nMARGE Anyone else residing there? \nSHEP Nope. \nMARGE Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning. It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling. \nShep says nothing. \nMARGE ...  Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole - \nSHEP So? \nMARGE Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater. \nSHEP Uh-huh. \nMARGE Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide... \nShep stares at her. \nMARGE ...  I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that. \nSHEP Nope. \nMARGE So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya? \nJERRY'S OFFICE \nJerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk.  At a noise he looks up. \nMarge has stuck her head in the door. \nMARGE Mr. Lundegaard? \nJERRY Huh?  Yah? \nMARGE I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here - \nJERRY What...  What is it all about? \nMARGE Huh?  Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here. \nMarge plops into the chair opposite him. \nMARGE ...  You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard? \nJERRY Naw, I...  Executive Sales Manager. \nMARGE Well, you can help me.  My name's Marge Gunderson - \nJERRY My father-in-law, he's the owner. \nMARGE Uh-huh.  Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera? \nJerry stares at her, his mouth open. \nMARGE ...  Mr. Lundegaard? \nJERRY ...  Brainerd? \nMARGE Yah.  Yah.  Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox. \nJERRY ...  Babe the Blue Ox? \nWade's jaw works as he glares out at traffic.  He mumbles to himself as he drives. \nWADE Okay ... here's your damn money, now where's my daughter?... Goddamn punk ... where's my damn daughter... \nHe pulls out a gun, cracks the barrel, peers in. \nWADE ...  You little punk. \nJERRY'S HOUSE \nJerry sits in the foyer, trying to pull on pair of galoshes. Scotty's voice comes from upstairs: \nVOICE ...  Dad? \nJERRY It's okay, Scotty. \nVOICE Where're you going? \nJERRY Be back in a minute.  If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers.  Oh, geez - \nThunk! - his first boot goes on. \nRADISSON \nMarge sits on the bed in her hotel room, shoes off, massaging her feet.  The phone is pressed to her ear, and through it, we hear ringing. \nVOICE ...  Hello? \nMARGE Norm? \nMILLE LACS LAKE \nIt is late evening, blowing storm.  A leisurely pan across the bleak gray expanse finds a little hut in the middle of the frozen lake with a pickup truck parked next to it. \nMARGE'S VOICE They bitin'? \nINT. HUT \nNorm has a cellular phone to his ear.  His feet are stretched out to an electric heater.  The interior is bathed in soft orange light. \nNORM Yah, okay.  How's the hotel? \nMARGE Oh, pretty good.  They bitin'? \nNORM Yeah, couple a muskies.  No pike yet.  How d'you feel? \nMARGE Oh, fine. \nNORM Not on your feet too much? \nMARGE No, no. \nNORM You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too.  How's the food down there? \nMARGE Had dinner at a place called the King's Table.  Buffet style.  It was pretty darn good. \nNORM Was it reasonable? \nMARGE Yah, not too bad.  So it's nice up there? \nNORM Yah, it's good.  No pike yet, but it's good. \nDAYTON-RADISSON RAMP \nThe top, open, level.  Snow blows.  A car sits idling. \nAnother car pulls onto the roof.  It creeps over to the parked car and stops.  It continues to idle as its door opens and Wade steps out, carrying the briefcase. \nThe door of the other car bangs open and Carl bounces out. \nCARL Who the fuck are you?  Who the fuck are you? \nWADE I got your goddamn money, you little punk.  Now where's my daughter? \nCARL I am through fucking around!  Drop that fucking briefcase! \nWADE Where's my daughter? \nCARL Fuck you, man!  Where's Jerry?  I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS - \nJerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his galoshes. \nSCOTT'S VOICE ...  Dad? \nJERRY Yah. \nSCOTT'S VOICE Stan Grossman called. \nJERRY Yah, okay. \nSCOTT'S VOICE Twice. \nJERRY Okay. \nSCOTT'S VOICE ...  Is everything okay? \nJERRY Yah. \nThoonk - the first boot comes off. \nSCOTT'S VOICE Are you calling Stan? \nJERRY Well...  I'm goin' ta bed now. \nCARL'S CAR \nCarl mumbles as he drives, underlit by the dim dash lights, one hand now holding a piece of rag to his shredded jaw. \nCARL ...  Fnnkn ashlzh...  Fnk... \nROAD \nCarl's car roars into frame, violently swirling the snow. Its red tail lights fishtail away. \nFADE OUT \nHOLD IN BLACK \nHARD CUT TO:  BRIGHT - LOOKING THROUGH A WINDSHIELD \nIt is a starky sunny day.  We are cruising down a street of humble lookalike houses. \nWe pan right as we draw toward one house in particular.  In its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow.  He notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave. \nThe driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer.  He gives a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over. \nOUTSIDE \nGary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel in the snow. \nMAN How ya doin'? \nGARY Mr. Mohra? \nMAN Yah. \nGARY Officer Olson. \nMAN Yah, right-o. \nThe two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and without standing particularly close.  They stand stiffly, arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their parka hoods.  Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face from protruding into the cold. \nMAN ...  So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,'  And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.' \nGARY Uh-huh. \nMAN So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk. \nGARY I unnerstand. \nMAN And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now.  So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.' \nGARY Ya got that right. \nMAN And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.'  And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.' \nGARY White Bear Lake? \nMAN Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption. \nVOICE His wife? \nMARGE Linda. \nVOICE No. \nMARGE Linda Cooksey? \nVOICE No.  No.  No.  They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year. Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone. \nMARGE So ... they didn't... \nVOICE No.  No.  They never married. Mike's had psychiatric problems. \nMARGE Oh.  Oh, my. \nVOICE Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now. \nMARGE Oh.  Geez. \nVOICE Yah, Linda's fine.  You should call her. \nMARGE Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a suprise. \nMARGE'S CAR \nMarge drives, gazing out at the road. \nMARGE AT A DRIVE-THROUGH \nShe leans out of her open window and yells at the order panel: \nMARGE Hello? \nMARGE AT THE GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE \nShe sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich. \nJERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE \nJerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers onto a form.  Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically checks.  The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible entries. \nJerry hums nervously. \nGlass rattles as someone taps at his door. \nJerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit with worry. \nMarge sticks her head in the door. \nMARGE Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother you again.  Can I come in? \nShe starts to enter. \nJERRY Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy - \nMARGE I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real short, then.  I'm on my way out of town, but I was just -  Do you mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying a bit of a load here. \nJERRY No, I - \nBut she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a sigh of relieved weight. \nMARGE Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday.  I was just wondering - \nJERRY Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing. \nMARGE Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates.  And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected. \nJERRY Yah, I see. \nMARGE So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently? \nJERRY The car's not from our lot, ma'am. \nMARGE but do you know that for sure without - \nJERRY Well, I would know.  I'm the Executive Sales Manager. \nMARGE Yah, but - \nWe are looking across a steam table at a man in blue.  He moves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a cafeteria line.  Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an eating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of uniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff. \nWe are listening to an offscreen woman's voice. \nWOMAN Well, so far we're just saying he's wanted for questioning in connection with a triple homicide.  Nobody at the dealship there's been much help guessing where he might go... \nThe woman is entering frame sliding a tray.  Marge enters behind her, sliding her own.  We move laterally with them as they slowly make their way along the line. \nMARGE Uh-huh. \nWOMAN We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there. \nMARGE And his wife? \nWOMAN She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared.  Nobody at his office knows where he is. \nMARGE Geez.  Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought.  You call his home? \nWOMAN His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months.  The big C. \nMARGE Oh, my. \nWOMAN And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling.  He's now wanted for assault and parole violation.  He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large. \nMARGE Boy, this thing is really ... geez. \nWOMAN Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know... \nMARGE Yah.  Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding. \nDETECTIVE SIBERT Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you.  When're you due? \nMARGE End a April. \nDETECTIVE SIBERT Any others? \nMARGE This'll be our first.  We've been waiting a long time. \nDETECTIVE SIBERT That's wonderful.  Mm-mm.  It'll change your life, a course. \nMARGE Oh, yah, I know that! \nDETECTIVE SIBERT They can really take over, that's for sure. \nMARGE You have children? \nDetective Sibert pulls an accordion of plastic picture sleeves from her purse to show Marge. \nDETECTIVE SIBERT I thought you'd never ask.  The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan. \nMARGE Oh, now he's adorable. \nDETECTIVE SIBERT He's three now.  Course, not in that picture. \nMARGE Oh, he's adorable. \nDETECTIVE SIBERT Yah, he - \nMARGE Where'd you get him that parka? \nThey have reached the end of the cafeteria line.  With a nod to the cashier, Detective Sibert indicates hers and Marge's trays. \nDETECTIVE SIBERT Both of these. \nMARGE Oh, no, I can't let you do that. \nDETECTIVE SIBERT Oh, don't be silly. \nMARGE Well, okay - thank you, Detective. \nDETECTIVE SIBERT Oh, don't be silly. \nGAEAR GRIMSRUD \nHe sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a TV tray he has set up in front of an easy chair. \nHe watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and diffused by snow.  The audio crackles with interference. Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds Grimsrud's complete attention. \nAt the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up. \nMARGE The day of our homicides. \nVOICE Yah. \nMarge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs down to a large frozen lake. \nMARGE And this guy is... \nVOICE Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant. \nMARGE Gustafson's accountant. \nVOICE Yah. \nMARGE But we still haven't found Gustafson. \nVOICE (crackle) -  looking. \nMARGE Sorry - didn't copy. \nVOICE Still missing.  We're looking. \nMARGE Copy.  And Lundegaard too. \nVOICE Yah.  Where are ya, Margie? \nWe hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as of a chainsaw or lawnmower. \nMARGE Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake. \nVOICE Oh.  Gary's loudmouth. \nMARGE Yah, the loudmouth.  So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson? \nVOICE Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em. \nMARGE Copy. \nVOICE We've got a - \nMARGE There's the car!  There's the car! \nWe are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down to a cabin.  Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera. \nVOICE Whose car? \nMARGE My car!  My car!  Tan Ciera! \nVOICE Don't go in!  Wait for back-up! \nMarge is straining to look.  The power-tool noise is louder here but still muffled, its source not yet visible. \nVOICE ...  Chief Gunderson? \nMARGE Copy.  Yah, send me back-up! \nVOICE Yes, ma'am.  Are we the closest PD? \nMARGE Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters. \nROAD EXTERIOR \nMarge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin. She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur- lined hood. \nFor a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of the power tool.  Then, with one curved arm half pressing against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the grinding noise. \nShe slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the next. \nThe roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree, her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints down toward the cabin's back lot. \nA tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a large power tool which his body blocks from view. \nMarge advances. \nThe man is forcing downward something which engages the roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises. \nThe man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn. \nThe roar is very loud. \nMARGE ...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard in there? \nShe glances up in the rear-view mirror. \nGrimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the road. \nMarge shakes her head. \nAt length: \nMARGE ...  I guess that was your accomplice in the wood chipper. \nGrimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out. \nMARGE ...  And those three people in Brainerd. \nNo response. \nMarge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself. \nMARGE ...  And for what?  For a little bit of money. \nWe hear distant sirens. \nMARGE ...  There's more to life than money, you know. \nShe glances up in the rear-view mirror. \nMARGE ...  Don't you know that?...  And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day... \nGrimsrud's hollow eyes stare out. \nThe sirens are getting louder.  Marge pulls over. \nMARGE ...  Well... \nShe leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling WHOOPS on her siren. \nShe turns on her flashers. \nShe leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities. \nShe stares forward, shakes her head.  We hear the dull click of her flashers. \nMARGE ...  I just don't unnerstand it. \nOutside it is snowing.  The sky, the earth, the road - all white. \nA squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white. It approaches in slow motion. \nAn ambulance punches through after it. \nAnother squad car. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nHIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL \nIt stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain. One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling police cruiser. \nMOTEL ROOM DOORWAY \nWe are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting lightly on their holstered sidearms.  One of them raps at the door. \nCOP ONE Mr. Anderson... \nA title fades in:  OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA \nAfter a pause, muffled through the door: \nVOICE ...  Who?... \nCOP ONE Mr. Anderson, is this your burgundy 88 out here? \nVOICE ...  Just a sec. \nCOP ONE Could you open the door, please? \n", "test1_input": "MINNEAPOLIS SUBURBAN HOUSE \nJerry enters through the kitchen door, in a parka and a red plaid Elmer Fudd hat.  He stamps snow off his feet.  He is carrying a bag of groceries which he deposits on the kitchen counter. \nJERRY Hon?  Got the growshries. \nVOICE Thank you, hon.

We had pancakes for breakfast.  I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe. Not more fuckin' pancakes.  Come on. \nGrimsrud gives him a sour look. \nCARL ...  Come on, man.

So...  Aw, geez. Here's the second one...  It's in the head and the ... hand there, I guess that's a defensive wound.  Okay. \nMarge looks up from the car. \nMARGE ...

Don't you - \n- punches him and flings him away. \nCarl hits a sofa and we see his bare legs disappear as he flips back over it. \nShep enters frame to circle the sofa and kick at Carl behind it. \nSHEP Fuck outta here.  Put me back in Stillwater.  Little fucking shit. \nThere is a knock at the door. \nVOICE Hey!  Come on in there! \nShep strides to the door, flings it open. \nA man in boxer shorts stands in the doorway. \nMAN C'mon, brother, it's late -  Unghh! \nShep hits him twice, then grabs both of his ears and starts banging his head against the wall. \nThe hooker runs by, clutching her clothes, and Shep kicks her in the ass as she passes. \nHe spins and goes back into the apartment. \nCarl is hopping desperately into his pants. \nCARL Stay away from me, man!  Hey! Smoke a fuckin' peace pipe, man! Don't you dare fuckin' -  Unghh! \nAfter hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out of his dangling pants and strangles him with it.  Carl gurgles.  Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the belt. \nCHAIN RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH \nCarl listens to the phone ring at the other end.  His face is deeply bruised and cut. \nFinally, through the phone... \nVOICE ...  Yah? \nCARL All right, Jerry, I'm through fucking around.  You got the fucking money? \nJERRY'S KITCHEN \nJerry is at the kitchen phone.  Through the door to the dining room we see Wade picking up an extension. \nJERRY Yah, I got the money, but, uh - \nCARL Don't you fucking but me, Jerry. I want you with this money on the Dayton-Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up. \nJERRY Yah, okay, but, uh - \nCARL You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it? \nJERRY ...  Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now - \nCARL GOT IT? \nJERRY Okay, real good, then. \nThe line goes dead. \nA door slams offscreen. \nEXT. HOUSE \nWade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the door and peels out. \nINT. CAR \n"}

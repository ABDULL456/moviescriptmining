The PRIMATE WOMEN are still, pounding roots and tending fires and dealing with climbing PRIMATE KIDS. They HEAR SHOUTS O.S.; gather and go to the ridge where they SEE 
POV FROM RIDGE -- The PRIMATE GUYS are coming back, without their jagged slabs and without any animals. But they are having great fun:

PRIMATE ELAINE (grunting, subtitled) Please don't tell me you got rid of your jagged rock slab.

ROGER It can hold a thousand addresses. 
ELAINE So can my address book. 
ROGER Can your address book pick up your em-ail? 
ELAINE No but my computer can. 
ROGER Well this can do both.

INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - THE NEXT MORNING 
A jubilant Lloyd is fixing his hair in the mirror. In the b.g., Harry is putting on his new ski clothes including a pair of thermal tights. 
LLOYD Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs. Mary Christmas. You 
know, it has kind of a ring to it, oesn't it, Har? 
HARRY Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you think you may be jumping the gun a little? I mean, who knows, when you get to know her, you may find out she's not your type. 
LLOYD Impossible. I know my type    when I see it. Now let me get this    straight, she wants me to meet her at    the Avalanche Bar and Grill on    Main Street? 
HARRY That's what she said. Ten o'clock sharp. 
This is when Lloyd notices Harry's get-up. 
LLOYD Time out. Where are going ressed like that. 
HARRY I, uh, thought while you were making your love connection I'd try my luck on the slopes. 
LLOYD You mean you're gonna go out in public dressed in tights? 
HARRY These aren't tights. They're fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers. 
LLOYD But you can see the outline of your who-who. 
Harry looks down at his crotch. 
HARRY Really? 
LLOYD Turn sideways. 
Harry turns his profile against the window. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Actually, it's just a tiny little lump. No one will ever notice. 
HARRY You're right. I can't go out dressed like this.

EXT. ASPEN BASE LODGE - DAY 
ESTABLISHING SHOT of the building. 
INT. ASPEN BASE LODGE 
People are putting their boots on and their skis are lined up on the wall behind them. Mary is waiting by the fireplace in an incredibly sexy snowsuit. 
Suddenly Harry appears in the room, dressed ridiculously. As he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward Mary, we see that he ALREADY HAS HIS SKIS ON. He kicks over a row of skis and gets glares from all sides. Finally he reaches her, OUT OF BREATH. 
HARRY Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving a clutch with these things. 
EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY 
Harry and Mary are at the front of the lift line. The couple ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into position. Harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair. The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a smooth pick up of Mary, that is. An embarrassed Harry is STILL IN THE CROUCHING POSITION, having missed the ride. Mary looks back at him, confused. Suddenly he pretends to be stretching. 
HARRY (CALLING OUT) You take the first run alone. I'm gonna loosen up down here.

INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - DAY 
Lloyd ENTERS the bar as the WAITERS are setting up for the day. 
WAITER I'm sorry, we don't open until eleven. This is disconcerting news to Lloyd. 
LLOYD I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait at the bar? 
The Waiter shrugs and Lloyd sits down at the empty bar. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY 
Harry and Mary are now sitting together on a chair as it rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top. Harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously. 
MARY Beautiful day, huh, Harry? 
HARRY Glorious. 
Mary takes a DEEP BREATH. 
MARY God, it feels so good to get up here. I haven't been outdoors much in the last couple of weeks.

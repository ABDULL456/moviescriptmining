{"train": "THE SANDLOT KIDS \nWritten by \nDavid Mickey Evans & Robert Gunter \nJune 10 th, 1992 \nA FADED KODACHROME PHOTO \nOf the 9 best (11-year-old) buddies that ever lived. On a makeshift baseball diamond - a sandlot... circa 1962: \nSCOTTY SMALLS, studious-looking; ALAN \"YEAH-YEAH\" McCLENNAN, little, hyper; HAMILTON \"HAM\" PORTER, tubby with a huge smile; KENNY DeNUNEZ, handsome bean pole; TOMMY \"REPEAT\" TIMMONS and his brother TIMMY; BERTRAM GROVER WEEKS, wearing inch- thick horn rims; JEFF \"SQUINTS\" PALLEDOROUS, a transistor radio plug wedged in his ear; and BENNY RODRIGUEZ, leaning on Scotty's shoulder, sporting the world's all-time hottest sneakers... P.F. Flyers. \nOne palm up, together like the 9 musketeers they're holding forward a baseball... with a mysterious smudge. \nNARRATOR Everyone's got that one summer when they were a kid... a summer so perfect, that it stays with them forever. It stays caught in time, like Camelot. pause That summer is like a book with a million blank pages that you get to fill with the greatest story you could ever dream up. (BEAT) This is a story about a legend. And for us, that summer was the one when the legend got made. \nWE CLOSE IN TIGHT on the black smudge, which becomes: \nA SERIES OF B&W PHOTOS & STOCK FOOTAGE \nGEORGE WASHINGTON crossing the Delaware. DANIEL BOONE in frontier buckskins. ABE LINCOLN giving the Gettysburg address. FREDERICK DOUGLAS orating from a podium. SITTING BULL in his splendor. THE WRIGHT BROTHERS at Kitty Hawk - this photo blends to news reel stock footage of the actual launch. The following also blend to stock: JOE LOUIS clobbering MAX SCHMELLING. JESSE OWENS in the '32 olympics. ALBERT EINSTEIN scrawling on a chalkboard. CHARLES LINDBERG and his Spirit of St. Louis land in Paris. As the waiting throngs cheer WILDLY: \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) Everybody sometime in their life has met a real live hero. (MORE) \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) They're not exactly a dime a dozen, but there's plenty of people who've done real great things. But hardly anyone has ever met a certified Legend, because most of them are dead before they get voted one. \nCHUCK YEAGER in the X-1 breaking the sound barrier. MACARTHUR stepping ashore, pipe clenched. JIM THORPE playing football. ELVIS PRESELY on stage in hep-cat duds. NEIL ARMSTRONG setting foot on the moon. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) So, to actually be there at the moment one gets made... well, forget about it. It never happens. Almost never... To understand how it all got started, you have to go back... \nWE PULL BACK FROM THE MOON - like a baseball in the sky. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) ...to the all-time, hands down, complete and undisputed Legend that ever lived. \nA BASEBALL in someone's hand. WE PULL BACK FROM IT. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) In any language, in any country, in any world. The Sultan of Swat. The King of Clout. The Great Bambino. You have to go back to... \nBABE RUTH is holding the baseball. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) ...The Babe. (BEAT) There's never been anyone greater than The Babe. And when he called his famous full count homerun in the 1932 world series, he made sure he'd live forever. \nTHE BABE \nhits a homerun. Settles into his signature, locomotive basepath chug. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) And it's a good thing he became immortal, because without him, what happened that summer, absolutely never (MORE) \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) would've happened. Weird thing was, before I moved to the neighborhood, I had no idea who he was. And he played a game I knew nothing about. \nSLO-MO - THE BABE'S CLEATS \nsend up chalky dust at each STEP. His foot hits home plate - taking us 30 years into the future. The Babe's antiquated leather cleat becomes... \nEXT. DODGER STADIUM - 1962 - DAY - STOCK \n...the cleat of basepath speedster MAURY WILLS. \nNARRATOR Fourteen years later, after The Babe was gone, there was another guy who had something to do with the legend getting made too. A guy who set a record that summer that was so awesome, some people still don't believe it. \nWILLS TAKES OFF, STEALING 3RD \nso fast that no one knows he's gone. The Pitcher fires to rd. The 3rd BASEMAN gloves the dirt. The UMPIRE wings the air. \nUMPIRE Safe! \nWILLS' CLEAT becomes \nTHE P.F. FLYER SNEAKER of... \nEXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND - 1962 - DAY \n...BENNY RODRIGUEZ, as he steps up to the plate. \nTHE PITCHER \nfires. \nBENNY \ncranks one deep to right. He tears around the bases like lightning (this kid is real fast). He rounds 3rd. The ball comes in home - cutting him off. He's caught in a pickle. FROM \nBEHIND THE CHAIN-LINK BACKSTOP \nYEAH-YEAH, HAM, DeNUNEZ, REPEAT, TIMMY, BERTRAM and SQUINTS come unglued and crowd the basepath. \nHAM PICKLE! \nBENNY \npickles the CATCHER and 3RD BASEMAN. He feints n' rubba-legs them out of position. He sprints for home. Safe! Just as he crosses home plate \nSQUINTS \npulls his transistor radio ear plug out. \nSQUINTS Thirty-one! Maury Wills just stole number thirty-one! \nremains undercover, but he's bustin' to join in. \nTHE GANG \nnever notices him. As they work: \nHAM Fifth grade's history, man. A hundred days, man. A Hundred days of baseball. All Day, everyday, as much as we can. That's the best. \nTIMMY We got all summer. \nREPEAT We got all summer. \nBENNY Let's play. \nYEAH-YEAH Yeah-Yeah... let's play. \nThe guys round up in the infield. As they play catch, they spread farther and farther apart... until they've each taken up the position they most like to play. They fit the paltry little diamond; scrappy, happy kids. \nEXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK \nTract homes - everybody's got a different thing going in the front yard. The guys (sans Timmons') split up toward their homes - slappin' gloves, \"so-longing\" for the night. \nNARRATOR Everyone but the Timmons twins lived on my new block. \nFROM HIS DRIVEWAY \nScotty, shuttling moving boxes to his garage, watches them go. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) They lived in a house by the sandlot and had the world's greatest tree house, because their dad was a contractor. \nFROM BENNY'S PORCH \nBenny is the last to go in. He sees Scotty watching. So, he nods... just a little. \nTHE BLOCK \nclears to empty. The street lamps arc on, drawing soft white circles on the sidewalks. FROM THIS HEIGHT, they look like baseballs dotting the neighborhood. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) Even before I knew any of them I envied that tree house... \nINT. BENNY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nA shrine to the pastime. Pennants, magazine pictures, game programs, baseball cards, a whole section of Maury Wills, radiating from a picture of Wills caught in a pickle. \nNARRATOR ...later, it would become second only to Cape Canaveral as a command post for history. (BEAT) When I moved in that summer, I'd never played baseball, but it wasn't too tough figuring out who these guys' heroes were. So, after a week of watching... I figured baseball seemed like the best way to get in with them. \nBENNY'S \nin bed, oiling his glove, staring out his window at Scotty's house. Taped to his footboard is the most important picture of all... a picture of The Babe. \nINT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJr. Chemistry set. Heath Kit gadgets. An unbelievable Erector Set contraption with little motors and stuff. An autographed picture of Mr. Wizard. Scotty's pj'd at his erector set table, bothered and unhappy. This stuff is too damn easy for him. He whips on a last bolt and connects the itty-bitty motor. SWITCHES ON \nTHE CONTRAPTION \na tiny scoopelvator snatches up a white marble. Drops it on a roller coaster track. The marble whips around corners and \nloop-da-loops... lands in a mini-catapult. Another motor draws it back via a winding string. Boy Scout camping-knife scissors ratchet in - snip the string - the catapult fires. \nTHE MARBLE \nleaps a little green fence and WONK! Ouuuhhh! beans \nHIS MOTHER (HAVING JUST COME IN) \nright in the forehead. \nBEDROOM \nScotty winces at the shot. \nSCOTTY Sorry, Mom. \nMOM I thought we agreed we'd take this apart... and not spend so much time in here. \nSCOTTY (FEELING LOW) I know - but it's just nighttime. \nMOM Scotty, have you made any friends yet? \nSCOTTY No. \nMOM Why not, honey? \nSCOTTY 'Cause I'm still \"new.\" \nMOM Honey, I don't want you sitting in here all summer fiddling with this stuff, like you did last summer... and the one before that. (BEAT) Scotty, look at me. I know you're smart, and I'm proud of you. But you have to get outside, you have to... play. \nShe sits across from him, trying to get through. \nMOM (CONT'D) I want you to get out in the fresh air and make friends. Run around and scrape your knees. Get dirty. Climb trees and hop fences. Get in trouble for crying out loud. (BEAT) Not too much, but some. You have my permission. Now how many mothers do you think say that to their sons? \nSCOTTY None mothers I guess. \nMOM I want you to make friends this summer, Scotty. Lots of them. \nSCOTTY I know, but I don't - I'm no good at anything. Face it, Mom, I'm just an EGGHEAD - \nMOM - and you'll always be just an egghead with an attitude like that. So promise me, alright? \nMom comes in behind Scotty. \nMOM Bill, can't you take a break and teach him now? \nSCOTTY Mom, it's okay - (NOBODY'S LISTENING) \nBILL Honey, I said I would and I will. I'm just under the gun here, ya know? \nSCOTTY Mom, really - \nMOM - How long could it take? You can't spare a half hour to show him? \nBill drops his pen. Checks his watch. A lost battle here. \nBILL (ANNOYED) Fine. Alright. I'll get my glove. Come on. \nBill exits past them. Scotty's been \"Mom-embarrassed.\" She looks at him: \nMOM (CLUELESS) There. See. Told you so. \nScotty shuffles out back, shaking his head. \nEXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY \nBill slides his hand into his glove. He warms up the cradle, POPPING the \"hardball\" into the palm. \nSCOTTY \nstands ready to \"learn\" on the other side of the yard. Appropriately pitiful in \"trout\" cap and toy glove. \nBACKYARD \nBILL Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where it goes. Okay? \nSCOTTY Yeah, okay, I think so. \nBill throws one to Scotty. The toy glove goes up to the right. The ball sails by to the left. \nSCOTTY (CONT'D) Darn. Sorry. \nBill's a little amazed at that one. He checks his watch. \nBILL That's alright, just throw it back. \nScotty eagerly retrieves it. Turns to throw - deja vu - he runs over, hands Bill the ball. \nSCOTTY Here. \nHe runs back across the yard. Turns 'round again. Holds his glove up stiffly. \nSCOTTY (CONT'D) Okay. I'm ready. \nBill cannot believe this. Checks his watch again. \nBILL Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where the ball goes. \nHe throws again. The ball bounces off the toy glove - breaks the webbing. \nSCOTTY Darn. My glove got - \nBILL - not bad. Right side at least. Now, just throw it back this time. \nSCOTTY But my glove - \nBill's looking at his watch again. Scotty fetches the ball - gulps - \"flips\" it back. \nBILL (DISBELIEF) Oh, my God. \nEXT. THE BLOCK - SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY \nBenny comes out of his house. From the sidewalk \nBENNY'S POV \nup the side of Scotty's house into the backyard. He can see Scotty. Only Scotty. Standing there game as hell, trying to catch balls that seem to be coming too fast. The ball comes. Scotty ducks. The ball hits the block wall behind him, caroming back toward where we assume Bill is throwing from. \nBENNY'S \ndrawing the wrong conclusion. \nEXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY \nScotty's still game. Bill's at ropes end. Check his watch again. \nBILL Alright, Scott, listen, this one's gonna come right at you, easy, okay? \nSCOTTY 'Kay. \nBILL Just keep your eye on the ball and put your glove up. You'll catch it. \nSCOTTY Okay. \nBILL \nthrows. \nTHE BALL \ncomes slowly forward. \nEXT. REAR OF FIVE & DIME - DAY \nBenny and Scotty come upon the gang (all their mouths are full a' bazooka) as Ham's chompin' on a candy cigar doing a BABE IMITATION: \nHAM Hey! Check me out! I'm the Great Bambino! \nThe gang laughs. \nSCOTTY (OVER EAGER) Who's that? \nThe gang stifles. They're none-to-pleased. Ham sees why. The new kid... \"flipper.\" Eight pairs of eyes burn holes in his little soul. \nHAM What?... (BEYOND HIM) What did he say? \nBERTRAM Were you born in a barn, man? \nYEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, what planet are you from? \nSQUINTS You never heard of The Sultan of Swat?! \nDENUNEZ The Titan of Terror! \nTIMMY The Colossus of Clout! \nREPEAT The Colossus of Clout! \nBENNY (even he's amazed) The King of Krash! \nNARRATOR I had no idea who they were talking about. But there was no way I could let them know that... so, I lied. \nSCOTTY Oh! The Great Bambino! Of course. I thought you said The Great Bambi. \nHAM (SHIVERING) That wimpy deer? \nSCOTTY Ah, yeah - I guess. Sorry. \nThe gang goes SILENT. They spit - they're tough. Scotty dribbles - he's wimpy. \nBENNY (W/MOUHTFUL) So, Scott, this is Ken DeNunez; Alan McClennan, we call him Yeah-Yeah; Hamilton Porter, we call him Ham; Tommy and Timmy Timmons, Bertram Grover Weeks, and Mike \"Squints\" Palledorus. (TO GANG) He's Scott Smalls. \nSCOTTY Hi. \nThe gang just stares. \nBENNY He's gonna play with us. He makes nine. Now we got a team. \nEXT. SANDLOT - DAY \nThe pack follows Benny onto the diamond. Scotty trails after them. \nBERTRAM Why'd you bring him for, Benny? \nBENNY 'Cause there's eight of us, and he makes nine. \nBERTRAM Yeah, so would my sister, but I didn't bring her! \nBENNY With nine Guys we got a whole team. \nHAM No, with Elswenger we had a whole team, and Elswenger could throw! \nDENUNEZ He ain't game, Benny. He can't throw for nothin'. \nScotty drifts off by himself. He can hear what's exchanged. \nTIMMY Benny, you already play all the empty positions since Elswenger moved to Arizona. \nBENNY And now I get to rotate 8 positions instead of 7. I need the practice. \nSQUINTS No you don't. It's stupid, Benny. The kid's an L-7 weenie. \nYEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, Oscar Mayer even. \nBENNY Oh yeah, Squints, and you're Willie freakin' Mays. You catch like a dork - anybody ever bust your chops about that? \nSQUINTS (PALTRY EXCUSE) No, but I'm - ya know, I'm - \nBENNY - and you run like a duck, Yeah- Yeah. \nYEAH-YEAH (IT'S TRUE) 'Kay-'kay... But I'm - \nBENNY - part-a the game. \nSQUINTS (DEFENSIVE) Right. \nYEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah. \nBENNY How come he don't get to be? \nNobody's got an answer for that one. Base up you blockheads.) \nTHE GANG \nhits the field. Their suspicious glares aren't lost on \nSCOTTY \nstanding off by himself, kinda lost. Benny comes over. \nBENNY (CONT'D) You take right field, Smalls. \ngives him a \"Thumbs Up.\" The significance of this is only outweighed by his sudden fear, when... \nSCOTTY \nglimpses something. \nSCOTTY'S POV \nof some great, lumbering thing moving past a crack in those green fiberglass panels. \nEXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK \nIn good spirits, the guys break off to their houses. \nSCOTTY & BENNY \nsplit up in the middle of the street between their homes. \nSCOTTY Thanks. \nAlready at his door, Benny just raises his glove in answer. \nSCOTTY (CONT'D) Wait, here - your glove. \nBENNY Keep it. \nINT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nScotty opens a new writing tablet, and titles the page: \"Baseball Stuff to Remember.\" He writes: \"1. The Great Bambino?\" He hasn't got a clue. \nEXT. VACANT LOT - DAY \nBenny coaches Scotty. Correct batting stance and swing. Benny thumb-flicks bottle caps at Scotty from a coffee can full. They're tough to hit. But soon Scotty's tagging every one of them. \nTHE SUN SETS. \nEXT. SANDLOT - DAY \nDeNunez fires - fastball. CRUNCH! \nSCOTTY \ntags it. The ball sails over \nSQUINTS' \nHead in center. From left field \nBENNY \ngives Scotty another \"Thumbs Up.\" The kid's in. \nEXT. SANDLOT - DAY - LATER \nSquints arrives with a box of baseball cards. \nNARRATOR Everyday, first thing, we'd all pick a card from what we called \"The Dugout.\" \nSquints shakes it up. Everybody picks one. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) It was just a shoe box, but whoever we picked, we got to be when it was our ups. One day, when Ham took his pick a little too seriously, the guys let me in on the world's most terrifying secret... \nBENNY Bingo! Maury Wills! \nSCOTTY Mickey Mou - ah, Mantle. \nYEAH-YEAH Say hey, Willie Mays. \nDENUNEZ Stan Musial. \nTIMMY Lou Brock. \nREPEAT Lou Brock - I mean, Luis Aparicio. \nBERTRAM Frank Robinson. \nSQUINTS Oh... Bob Uecker. \nHAM Hank Aaron. I'm up. \nEXT. SANDLOT - DAY - MINUTES LATER \nThe gang \"peppers\" \nHAM \n(at home plate) mercilessly. \nDENUNEZ \npitches - strike. Pitches again - strike. Delivers and \nHAM \ntakes a Ruthian cut at it. CONNECTS to deep right. \nSCOTTY \ntracks it. \nHam's brought personal s'mores supplies. \nHAM Wanna s'more? \nSCOTTY Some more of what? \nHAM No. You wanna s'more? \nSCOTTY I haven't had anything yet, so how can I have any more of nothing? \nHAM You kill me Smalls. Look, these are s'mores stuff. Pay attention: (CONCOCTING) First you take the graham - you put the chocolate on the graham, Hershey's of course - you hold the chocolate on the graham while you roast the mallow- \nHe does. The mallow flames to life. \nHAM (CONT'D) -then when the mallow's flamin', ya stuff it on the chocolate and cover it with the other end. (BEAT) Then, you scarf. \nHam does. The junk squirts half way down his shirt. \nHAM (CONT'D) (BARELY INTELLIGIBLE) Kinda messy... Good though. \nSquints turns the lantern down low... \nSQUINTS Alright, listen up. (TO SCOTTY) First time DeNunez heard this story he FAINTED - \nDENUNEZ - Bull, Squints! \nBENNY You did, man. \nDeNunez shuts up. It's true. \nSQUINTS When Yeah-Yeah heard it he peed his pants. \nYEAH-YEAH Shut up, Squints - did not! \nHAM You did, man. \nSQUINTS And when The Ham heard it he barfed up two bags of marshmallows. \nHAM Liar! It was only one. \nSQUINTS So stay away from the door... you might fall out. And don't sit on your sleeping bag... you could shit your pants. (SOLEMN) Now, quiet... \nAbsolute silence. Kid-reverence equals fright. \nSQUINTS (CONT'D) The legend of The Beast goes back a long time... before any of us could pick up a baseball. Back to a place called Mertle's Acres. \nDREAMY DISSOLVE TO: \nTHE STORY OF THE BEAST: \nEXT. \"MERTLE'S ACRES\" - DAY \nA legendary place... benefitting from years of kid- embellishment: a gothic, scrapyard fortress oddly designed to keep something in not out. \nSQUINTS (V.O.) The Beast belongs to Mr. Mertle, the guy that used to own Mertle's Acres Junkyard. And nobody's ever seen him since the day it happened... \nINT. MERTLE'S ACRES - DAY \nBlurbling pockets of super-heated muck. \nBURNED-OUT SHELLS \nof twisted vehicles - strewn carcasses. A battlefield. \nOLD APPLIANCES \nthat form tortured faces in the shadowy recesses. \nSQUINTS (V.O.) Mertle's Acres was a bitchin' place, that had everything you could ever imagine. \nOTHER STUFF \nlike savaged shopping carts. A school bus graveyard. Scrap motorbikes. Cargo ship buoy balls. The gutted shell of a fighter plane. \nSQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D) And the stuff was worth a fortune. So, one day Mr. Mertle got him this new pup from the pound. They were glad to get rid of him, on account of while he'd been there, he'd killed three dogs bigger than he was. (BEAT) That was exactly what Mr. Mertle figured he needed to protect his junkyard, 'cause people kept stealing stuff at night, when he wasn't around. \nWE DRIFT THROUGH \na maze of dark, grimy junk-passageways. \nSQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D) So he bought The Beast, and set him loose in Mertle's Acres. \nSOMETHING LOPES BY \nat the end of a passage. (NOTE: We never fully see The Beast.) \nSQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D) The Beast was still just a pup of six months, but he already weighed a 150 pounds... and he kept gettin' bigger. \nA TRASH BAG \nfull of meat hits the ground - disappears. SLIFFTHT! It spits back INTO FRAME... empty and tattered. \nSQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D) He threw The Beast a trash bag full of meat every night, and just left him alone. All alone in the whole place by himself... to grow. \nAN EYEBALL \namong a pile of broken headlights. As big as the headlights. \nFLEETING GLIMPSES OF MORE STUFF \nINT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT \nHam drools mallow goop. His hands are fisted tight... 'mallows squirt out twixt his clenched fingers. \nREPEAT & TIMMY \nhave their pillows 'round their heads like bonnets. \nDENUNEZ & YEAH-YEAH \nstare and shake. \nBERTRAM'S \neyes are shut tight, his bottom lip shudders. \nBENNY \ngulps. \nSCOTTY'S \nsitting shattered. He checks his pants to see if he's peed them. His mallow's a briquette. It SPUTTERS and flames out. \nSQUINTS \nis proud of his story prowess. \nSQUINTS And so... The Beast sits there under that lean-to, dreaming about the time when he can break the chain and get out... dreaming of the time when he can chase and kill again. \nTHE GANG \nBERTRAM See, man. That's why you can't go over there. Nobody ever has. Nobody ever will. \nHAM One kid did, but nobody ever seen him again. \nDENUNEZ That ain't true - \nHAM - yeah it is! He got eaten! \nYEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah - that kid who went to get his kite... what was his name? \nDENUNEZ \"Boogers\" Fleming? \nTIMMY No. It was that guy with the warts on his face. \nREPEAT Davy \"The Toad.\" \nTIMMY That's what I said. \nSolemnity spreads among them. Kid-reverence. \nSQUINTS Davy \"The Toad\" Stodenrous. \nBERTRAM Yeah, The Toad... \nYEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, poor Toad. \nSCOTTY (WEAK) Nuh-uh... none of that's true. You guys are just - \nSQUINTS - oh, yeah?... Come here. Stick your head out the window and look down. \nScotty goes slowly... He sticks his head out guillotinely, through the small square opening. \nEXT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT \nScotty's head comes out turtle-like. The tree house overhangs the common wall. \nHE LOOKS DOWN INTO \nMr. Mertle's backyard and SEES an old footed bathtub filled with murky water. A steel pole, cemented into the center of the yard. A tow chain, snaking away from the pole and vanishing under the lean-to. Dust rises and falls from 'neath the lean-to. \nSCOTTY \nhears the ORGANIC EXHAUST that accompanies the dust... rising and falling... in POWERFUL EXHALATIONS. \nINT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT \nScotty pulls his head back, scared shitless. \nSCOTTY (HUSHED) He's down there! \nSQUINTS You bet he is. \nHAM Whatever goes over that fence... stays there. \nSQUINTS It becomes the property of The Beast... Forever. \nEXT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT \n(NOTE: Same as Sc. 54) FROM THE SANDLOT... a FULL MOON hangs ominously over the tree house; a glowing little box of debate in the scary night. \nNARRATOR I learned that more than a 150 baseballs had gone over that fence... and not one of them was ever seen again. Even when some brave kid worked up enough courage to peek over the fence. (MORE) \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) (BEAT) Because, when they went over, they vanished. (BEAT) I knew it was true, because when I looked down in there, I didn't see a single... solitary... one. \nEXT. FIVE & DIME - MORNING \nSquints and Yeah-Yeah come out of the store in a big hurry, with a new baseball in a box. They stop momentarily - open it and chuck the box. Yeah-Yeah rams his mouth full of 'zooka WHILE \nNARRATOR Benny would've played ball all day and all night... rain shine, tidal wave, whatever, it didn't matter. Baseball was the only thing he cared about and everything else was just a waste of time. (BEAT) But, of all the things we ever did besides baseball, goin' to the pool was what he tolerated best. Even though none of us had ever seen a Playboy magazine - which we constantly lied about - we figured the pool was the next best thing to being there. \nTHE GANG \ndunks each other, play \"attack-sub,\" etc... \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) It wasn't the Pool Honeys like we said, 'cause if any one of them had come up to any one of us, we'd of peed our pants. (BEAT) We went for... the Lifeguard. \nTHE LIFEGUARD \nis unbelievable. In fact, it's WENDY PEFFERCORN. She slides Coppertone up and down her legs. \nTHE GANG \none by one, stop foolin' around. Chest deep in the shallow end, they're a detached and frozen pocket of leering dopes. The OTHER 80 KIDS in the pool play on around them. \nSQUINTS \nis suddenly afflicted. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) And one day, it became too much for Michael \"Squints\" Palledorous. And he did the most desperate thing any of us had ever seen. \nTHE LIFEGUARD \noils up and down. \nTHE GANG \ngawks on. (Cool Hand Luke scene): \nBENNY Oh, man... \nYEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, too cruel. \nTIMMY She don't know what she's doing. \nREPEAT She don't know what she's doing. \nBENNY Yeah she does. She knows exactly what she's doing. \nSQUINTS I've swum here every summer of my adult life... and every summer there she is. (LOSING IT) Lotioning... oiling... smiling. (TEETH CLENCHED) I - can't - take - this - no - more! \nTHE GANG WATCHES AS SQUINTS \npushes through the water, pulls himself out, and walks really fast to the diving board (taking off his glasses to impress her as he passes.) \nSCOTTY What's wrong with him? \nYEAH-YEAH (WORRIED) Don't-know, but that's the deep end, and Squints can't swim! \nSQUINTS \nwalks the plank to the end. Looks wantingly toward \nTHE LIFEGUARD \nwho smiles back at him. \nSQUINTS \nholds his nose. Takes the deep leap. Hits the water and... \nUNDERWATER \n...sinks like a stone. Squints grins as he founders. \nTHE GANG \nlines the edge of the deep section. \nBERTRAM Squints! \nHAM Oh my God! He's drowning! \nTHE LIFEGUARD \nto the rescue. Seconds pass... she surfaces and lays a limp SQUINTS \nON THE DECK \nEverybody at the pool gathers 'round. The Lifeguard lays Squints flat. She administers mouth-to-mouth. \nThe gang watches on tense as hell. \nSquints peeks at them through a secretly opened eye. As the Lifeguard is \"saving\" his sneaky life, Squints can no longer restrain himself, he grabs her - gives her a sloppy SMOOCH! She tears away. Stands up over his wimpy little form: \nLIFEGUARD You little pervert! \nShe grabs Squints by the scruff of the neck. Run-walks him toward the exit, and... \nEXT. PUBLIC POOL - DAY \n...chucks his boney butt into the hedges. The guys scramble out, dragging their clothes after them. They help Squints up. \nHAM Did you plan that?! \nSQUINTS A'course I did. Been plannin' it for years. \nThey let Squints walk out front: \nHeads are scratched. Chins are rubbed. Thoughts are thunk. \nTIMMY Most likely. \nSCOTTY Hey, guys? Has anyone ever really seen The Beast? \nTHE GANG STOPS \nexcept Scotty, he goes forward - turns back. \nSQUINTS Look, Smalls. You ever seen King Kong for real? In person, I mean? \nSCOTTY No. But - \nSQUINTS - well, he's real right? \nSCOTTY Yeah, a'course. \nSQUINTS And he's still out there somewhere right? \nSCOTTY Yeah. \nSQUINTS See, there's just somethings that are. Ya know, stuff that it's better not to talk about... 'cause thinkin' about it just makes it worse.

SCOTTY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nScotty stares up at the ceiling in oceans of worry. \nINT. BENNY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe room is dark. Benny's in bed. He clicks on a \"baseball- bat\" flashlight. Shines the beam toward his footboard... illuminating the photo of The Babe. \nBENNY We can't get it back, Babe. (BEAT) I'm sorry. \nSuddenly, a RACKET from inside Benny's closet. A bright LIGHT GOES ON in there. Then, smoke comes out. \nBenny jumps up on his bed - flattens against the wall. Hasn't done this in years: \nBENNY (CONT'D) M - M - Mom?... \nThe closet door CREAKS open... by itself. Everything inside is oddly devoid of color. \nBENNY (CONT'D) Who's there?! \nBABE RUTH steps out of the closet. He exists in the only way any kid from 1962 has ever seen him: BLACK & WHITE. \nTHE BABE Now don't go peeing your pants or nuthin', I'm just here to give ya a hand. \nThe Great Bambino PUFFS on a massive stogie... the source of all the smoke. \nBENNY B - B - But, you're... \nTHE BABE ...dead? Legends never die, kid. \nBenny comes off the wall. The enormous Ruth towers over him. \nBENNY You're really him. You're The Babe. The Sultan of Swat. The King - \nTHE BABE - of Krash and a hundred other dopey names. Forget about that, we ain't got much time. I'm here 'cause you're in some kinda pickle, right? \nBENNY Yeah. \nTHE BABE A baseball with my John Hancock on it went over a fence, and you can't get it back. Right? \nBENNY Yeah, right. \nTHE BABE (clear and simple) Then just hop over there and get it. There ya go. Problem solved. (tips his cap) See ya, kid. \nThe Babe turns to go back to wherever he came from. Benny grabs his arm - shocked that he actually feels something \"real.\" \nBENNY Wait! I can't. \nTHE BABE Can't what? \nBENNY Go into that backyard. \nTHE BABE Why not? \nBENNY There's a Beast back there. \nTHE BABE What kind? \nBENNY A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one kid already. \nTHE BABE Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid. (MORE) \nTHE BABE (CONT'D) Everybody gets one chance to do something great. Most people either never take the chance 'cause they're too scared, or they don't recognize it when it spits on their shoes. (BEAT) This is your \"big chance,\" and ya shouldn't let it go by. (PAUSE) Remember those cards you got the other day? \nBENNY Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in the same pack. \nTHE BABE What're the odds on that? \nBENNY About a zillion to one. \nTHE BABE More even.

And then, unbelievably \nBENNY & THE BEAST \nAre coming right at them! They race across the sandlot. Kill- anxious beast-drool splashes the seat of Benny's pants. \nTHE BEAST'S \nmuscles flex. \nBENNY \njust runs. He runs as if a big dog was chasing him. He lurches a step - RIP! A pants pocket flaps from an incisor. \nBENNY LOOK OUT! \nHe lays down the world's all-time most perfect SLIDE. He careens toward the bottom of \nMR. MERTLE'S FENCE \nhits it and, defying gravity, RUNS STRAIGHT UP THE GREEN FIBERGLASS PANELS! \nBENNY \njets upward, leaving smashed green fiberglass footsteps - standing out from the fence 90 degrees - the Donald O'Connor \"Singin' In The Rain\" trick! \nTHE BEAST \nsucks air - ROARS - EXPLODES from the ground - soars, gaping maw first, right for \nBENNY \nwho pushes off the top of the fence. \nTHE BEAST \nGNASHES up at Benny's heels - misses by an inch. He plummets toward the Badlands. Then, the unspeakable happens, \nBENNY \nDROPS \nTHE BABE RUTH AUTOGRAPH \nand comes tumbling down after the ball. \nBENNY (CONT'D) Oh noooooo! \nEXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY \nBenny HITS the dirt with a gut twisting THUD! Dust everywhere. \nEXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY \nThe gang climbs the fence. They look down into \nEXT.

Suddenly, from the \nFENCETOP \nHis shirt snagged: \nSCOTTY Help him! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Help him! \nTHE BEAST \nis hanging from the fence. His chain has caught. He struggles - choking to death - right below Scotty. \nTHE GANG \npetrifies where they stand. \nSCOTTY \ntears his shirt loose. Scrambles to where The Beast hangs. Tries to lift the tow chain free - too heavy! He'll die in seconds. \nSCOTTY Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can let him off! (DESPERATE) COME ON! \nNOBODY \nmoves. They wanna but they can't! \nSCOTTY \ngoes for broke. He reaches out and puts his hand on The Beast's head. \nSCOTTY (CONT'D) (CONTACT) Easy. Easy, boy. \n", "test1_input": "THE GANG'S \nalready playing \"over the line.\" \nNARRATOR They never kept score. They never chose sides. They never even really stopped playing the game... it just went on forever. Everyday they picked up right where they left off the day before. It was an endless \"dream game.\" (BEAT) There was only 8 of them, so they didn't have a whole team. It didn't matter though... Benny was so good he took everyone's position when it was there ups. (BEAT) I didn't know any of that then... I just knew they were having the time of their lives and I wanted to be a part of it. \nSCOTTY \nwatches and listens (as he goes) to the SHARP, satisfying sound of the hardball, SNAPPING CLEANLY in the oily leather of their gloves. \nHE LOOKS AT \nhis own toy glove... how embarrassing. \nSCOTTY \ncontinues around the perimeter, trying to be seen and become invisible. He goes unwittingly CLOSER TO those green fiberglass panels. \nDENUNEZ \nwinds up and pitches to \nBENNY \nwho connects big. CRACK! \nSCOTTY'S \ncome too close to the green fence. Something has overcome him... fear! He stares with serious woollies at \nA HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS \nand sees only dust rising in time with some great, SOUNDS OF EXHALATION. And then, before he can draw any conclusions... disaster. \nGANG (O.S.) Hey! Look out! \nSCOTTY \nwhips a look up and sees \nTHE FLY BALL \ncoming right at him. \nSCOTTY \ntracks it, frozen stiff. Scared shitless. At the past possible moment, he throws his arms over his face and ducks... social suicide. \nTHE BALL \nbeans him at the glove covering his noggin. \nSCOTTY \nhits his butt. The ball rolls a bit. Comes to an \"I-dare- you\" stop: right up against the diseased fiberglass panels of that preternatural fence. Scotty pulls his arms away from his face. \nTHE GANG \nLAUGHS uproariously. \nTIMMY Nice catch! \nREPEAT Nice catch! \nHAM Hey! Throw the ball back! \nYEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, hurry up! \nBERTRAM We gotta a game here, man! \nSCOTTY \nmoves for the ball. As he goes, he sweats: \nSCOTTY 'Kay, I'll get it! (TO HIMSELF) Don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus. \nHe reaches the fence and the ball and stops. It's hard to move. The force emanating from the backyard has got him: \nDUST THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS \nkeeps perfect time with the monster-breathing. \nAN OLENADER BUSH \nmoves. It scares the living kapok out of \nSCOTTY \nwho snatches up the ball and back-pedals 10 feet. \nSQUINTS WE'RE WAITING... \nHe throws back the ball. And his chances of getting in with these guys are over. Because Scotty... throws like a girl! \nTHE BALL \ndroops forward in the air. Lands 6 feet from him. Rolls slowly up to the gang, finally coming to a dainty stop at DeNunez' feet. \nTHE GANG \n", "test1_true": "SCOTTY \nwalks away... crying. \nSCOTTY (TO HIMSELF) My life is over. \nBENNY \nis the only one that isn't laughing.

I mean not that bad, but at least so bad that he hadda move in the fourth grade 'cause they nicknamed him \"Bloomers.\" \nBenny's look stifles the bunch. \nBENNY I bet not one of you knows how The Babe got his nickname. \nHAM Easy, 'cause of the way he looked like a little kid face. \nBERTRAM Bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids and stuff. \nSQUINTS Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe, because he was like the child of Yankee Stadium. \nBENNY I knew it. You're all full of crap. George Herman Ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage. \nSilence. None of the other guys has heard this before. \nBENNY (CONT'D) Nobody liked him there. The bigger guys picked on him all the time. And when they messed with him he couldn't fight back, 'cause he was just... like scared. So when they messed with him, he cried about it. (BEAT) He cried... so they called him The Babe. \nThis hits home real good. \nBENNY (CONT'D) How ya think that kid just felt? \nBenny exits the sandlot, leaving the others with a lesson learned. \nNARRATOR Everyone knew Benny was different. Nobody ever voted or anything, but he was the leader. \nEXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK \nAs Benny goes into his house, the other's round the corner far behind him. \nTHE MOON \nis up. Full. Like a big baseball. \nNARRATOR Even though he seemed like a regular guy, he wasn't. Benny was special, and he was loyal. (BEAT) When they'd all tried out for youth league, they'd all made it. But when they found out they'd have to play on different teams, Benny told 'em that if they couldn't play together, they shouldn't play at all. So, they stayed together. \nEXT./INT. BENNY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nBenny's at the window, clutching a baseball, staring over at Scotty's house. \nNARRATOR So, the only person that ever felt sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez. (BEAT) Even though neither of us knew it at the time, we were connected. Like I had been born for just that one moment, when I would perform the world's all- time boner, and Benny would bail me out. (BEAT) Connected as friends... born to meet for just that one moment. \nWe DRIFT OFF Benny to his PICTURE OF MAURY WILLS in a pickle. \nINT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY \nA PICTURE OF MAURY WILLS on a Post Super Sugar Crisp box. \nBILL & SCOTTY \nat the table. Bill sifting through mounds of paperwork. Scotty eating breakfast. Scotty's spoon CLANGS one too many times. Bill looks up at him. \nSCOTTY Sorry... \nScotty picks up his bowl and cereal, goes into \nINT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - DAY \nwhere his mom is making coffee. \nMOM (QUIETLY) Well?... \nSCOTTY He's too busy, Mom. \nMOM (ENCOURAGING) Go back in there and ask. He'll take the time. Go on. \nINT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY \nScotty comes back in. Stops mutely near Bill. Long, agonizing seconds pass. Finally: \nSCOTTY Um, Da - \nQuick look toward the kitchen, then: \nSCOTTY (CONT'D) (so Mom won't hear) - I mean, Bill. Could we... I mean could you, like you said - teach me to catch today? \nBILL Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta get this done. \nIt ain't much, but it's something. \nSCOTTY Okay, thanks. \n", "test1_id": 2418, "test2_input": "widen, focusing. \nWAR BREAKS OUT! \nBenny goes for the ball. \nTHE BEAST'S \nknotted muscles quaver and UNCOIL. \nBENNY'S \nP.F. Flyers leave behind tiny dust roosters. \nTHE BEAST'S \nclaws dig deep furrows. FOG BANKS of dust spread out behind it. Forelegs gallop at flared, over-anxious angles. \nBENNY \nleaves scrambling footprints. He slides - grabs the ball - \"Pops-Up\" Maury Wills fashion - heads back for the fence. The ball slips from Benny's fingers. Re-grabs it - shoves the ball in his teeth, freeing his hands for the leap up the fence. \nTHE BEAST \ngains. SHNAPP! Jaws SHUT like a tripped bear trap. \nBENNY \nsprings off the ground. He's on the fence. \nTHE BEAST \nreaches chain's end - it goes taught. Breaks! The two foot length still attached to The Beast's neck bullwhips - the chain catches Benny in the butt. \nBENNY YOWWWWW! \nHe vaults over the fence. \nEXT. SANDLOT - DAY \nThe gang looks up. A great shadow envelopes them. \nTHE BEAST IS LOOSE! \nThe guys turn to stone. Benny takes off. \nBENNY OOOOH SSSSHIT! \nThe Beast tears by the guys after Benny. The two vanish out of the sandlot. \nSCOTTY What're we waitin' for?! Let's go after 'em! \nEXT. SIDEWALK - NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nBenny runs. The Beast is gaining. In its wake: dichondra lawns RIPPED to shreds. Scotty and the guys make tracks a block behind. \nEXT. FIVE & DIME - DAY \nOn display: Pinwheels, Mailbox Propellers and Puddle-Jumpers. Benny flies by. The Beast follows. As they pass, contact: the whirly-gigs take off! \nINT. CAR - TRAVELING - DAY \nA MOTHER drives. In the passenger seat, her TODDLER fingers a \"scooter-pie\" in marshmallowy strings. \nTODDLER (BEAMING) Mommy, mommy - wook! Ah, ah - goggy! (BEAT) Big goggy. \nThe Mother looks out the passenger window. \nON THE SIDEWALK \nBenny and The Beast run even. Then pull ahead. \nEXT. \"SNELGROVE'S\" ICE CREAM - DAY \nGag per storyboards - t.b.d. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY \nBenny's cookin'. The Beast follows - TRASHCANS SCATTER like bowling pins. \nScotty and the guys follow. All slow to check out the garbage bins... so many crushed beer cans. \nBenny darts in the rear entrance to a \"random\" building. The Beast tears after him - KNOCKING the door off its hinges. \nINT. BOYS CLUB AUDITORIUM - DAY \nON THE MOVIE SCREEN Kong does battle with T Rex. \nBENNY \ncomes sliding AT US across the waxed stage floor - from under the movie screen. He slides off the stage - into midair - lands on his feet. Splits up the aisle between the rows of folding chairs and blasts out the door. \nKIDS' HEADS \nturn to watch him. KONG ROARS! They look back at \nTHE MOVIE SCREEN \nwhere, just as Kong proclaims himself king over the dead T Rex, \n", "test2_true": "Leaps through the center of the silver screen - leaves a 6 foot hole - lands 20 feet down the aisle - CRASHES through the doors and disappears. \nMoments pass. Our guys follow. \nEXT. SIDEWALK - DAY \nHot-rubber SQUEAKS from Benny's P.F. Flyers. The Beast's claws leave jagged scars in the concrete. \nCATS HISS \nin terror and faint. \nEXT. PUBLIC POOL DECK - DAY \nPOOL HONEYS lounge, all bedecked with rock-hard, Annette Funicello hairdo's. \nBenny blasts out of the pool building, \"tire stepping\" over \nthe Honeys. They're up and RANTING at him. Until, The Beast comes... \n...sliding across the water-slippy deck like an out-of-control anvil. He \"bowling pins\" the Pool Honeys. The Honeys HIT THE WATER. \nBenny cuts back through the pool building. The Beast follows - parting our guys and the other Kids. \nEXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY \nGame in progress. From outta nowhere, Benny jams across the diamond. The game stops... EVERYONE gapes at: \nSome huge dog-beast charging after a kid. \nEXT. CITY PARK - PICNIC AREA - DAY \nBig banner: \"FOUNDER'S DAY!\" Perfectly arranged picnic blankets covered with wonderful spreads of goodies. \nBENNY \nzips under the banner - runs through - grabs a Coke like a long distance runner. \nTHE BEAST \nrages after him, through: \nA DEADEND! MIDWAY \nof neatly arranged display booths. (This is pie n' cake booth gag per storyboards - allow 2 pages.) \nEXT. TOWN SQUARE - NEARBY - DAY \nFounder's Day parade (et al). \nBENNY \nrips into the square. He rubba-leg zigzags, nimbly avoiding everything and everyone. \nTHE BEAST \nIs a runaway freight train. He PLOWS through CLOWNS. CHILDREN are snatched from the dog's path by terrified parents. The Beast tears through the concession stands: \nVATS & DISPENSERS \nEXPLODE! The VOLUNTEERS dash out SCREAMING - \"tar n' featherd\" with baked beans and potato chips. \nBENNY \nzips through the MARCHING BAND - ducking trombone slides - leaping glockenspiels. \nTHE BEAST \nain't so graceful. He \"barn-doors\" the band. CRASH! An instrument tangled heap. \nTHE ONLOOKERS \npour into the street, knocking the MAYOR from his convertible, and the FOUNDER'S DAY QUEEN from her float. \nFROM THIS HEIGHT \nthis all looks like the end of a \"Dr. Suess\" book! \nSCOTTY AND THE GANG \nsearch through the confusion. _They've lost Benny_! Suddenly, doubling back on them \nBENNY \nSHOOTS BY: \nBENNY Sandlot! \nBenny's gone. Seconds later - The Beast follows. \nSQUINTS This way! Shortcut! \nTHE GANG \nforges through the disaster. \nEXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - DAY \n", "test2_id": 2419, "test3_input": "INT. MR. MERTLE'S HOUSE - DAY \nFairly spartan, except for one room, where it seems that Mr. Mertle spends most of his time. He leads Benny and Scotty INTO \nTHE BASEBALL ROOM \nMr. Mertle sits at a table. Benny and Scotty stare at the tabletop. \nIt holds a scale model Baseball Diamond: green felt field and little bases, outfield wall and miniature player figures. A picture on the wall of Mr. Mertle and Babe Ruth. \nSCOTTY You knew Babe Ruth? \nMR. MERTLE Yeah. And he knew me too. (BEAT) They never let us play together, but we were friends. Good friends. He was almost as great a hitter as I was. But, he'd of told you he was better. \nThe picture is signed: \"To Thelonius Johnson Mertle, the second greatest slugger I ever saw... Babe Ruth.\" \nA baseball game on the RADIO. As each play is CALLED, Mr. Mertle's hands deftly put his tiny players in the correct positions. Mr. Mertle is blind. \nMR. MERTLE (CONT'D) (HOLDING BALL) This the one that went over my fence? \nBENNY Yeah. \nMr. Mertle brushes his fingers over the leather. \nMR. MERTLE This is an old ball, boys. Really old. (BEAT) Hercules gave it a good chewing, didn't he? \nSCOTTY (WEAK) Yes, sir. \nMR. MERTLE You sound upset, son - what's wrong? \nSCOTTY Well, you see... that ball belongs to my stepdad... and, uh - it was signed by Babe Ruth. \nMr. Mertle shakes his head... hands the ball to Scotty. \nMR. MERTLE Hmm. Well, I'm sure your dad will understand. \nSCOTTY I don't think so. \nOn the RADIO, Wills steals second. \nMR. MERTLE (TO BENNY) Son, move Maury Wills to second base for me, will ya? \nBenny moves the little figure to second base. \nMR. MERTLE (CONT'D) If he steals third that'll be number (TO SCOTTY) Helluva pickle you're in, boy. \nSCOTTY Yes, sir... \nMr. Mertle retrieves something from a glass case. A baseball. \nMR. MERTLE I'll make you a deal. If you boys come over once a week and talk baseball with me, I'll trade you balls. \nBENNY Well, that's really nice of you... but this ball really is signed by The Babe. \nMR. MERTLE (CHUCKLES) This one really is too... and all the rest of the '27 Yankees. \nHe hands his baseball to Scotty... Benny stares at it in disbelief. \nBENNY Oh my God - Murderers' Row. \nAs they ogle the ball: \nBENNY (CONT'D) (AWED) Lou Gehrig... \nSCOTTY Babe Ruth. \nMR. MERTLE (SMILING) They're all there. \nScotty hands Mr. Mertle the chewed up Babe Ruth ball. Shakes his hand. \nSCOTTY Deal. \nOn the RADIO, Maury Wills steals 3rd for his 100th stolen base. Scotty notices the wall clock: \nEXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY \nMom's car is in the driveway. Scotty goes up the walkway slowly. Benny just behind him. The gang lingers at the sidewalk. Scotty sets one foot on the \nPORCH \nand Bill comes out. He looks none-too-pleased. He towers over Scotty. The gang hangs their heads. \nBILL This better be good. \nBenny unpockets a little felt bag. Hands it to Scotty. He holds the bag up to a perplexed Bill, who opens it. He looks from Scotty to Benny and back again. Then... \n...stares down at the \"Murderers' Row\" ball. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY \nA BASEBALL sailing through the air. SMACK! it's caught in a brand new glove. Scotty's new glove. Scotty snap throws the ball back to Bill. He and Scotty are having a great game of catch. \nNARRATOR It was weird that Benny said Babe Ruth was like the Hercules of baseball, and then The Beast's name turned out to be Hercules. (BEAT) It was also strange that Mr. Mertle had a Murderers' Row ball to replace the one signed by The Babe. \nBill and Scotty smile as they fire the cowhide back and forth. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) Some people might say that it was all a coincidence... but looking back at it now, it seems like everything was connected, just like me and Benny. (BEAT) It was like we were a part of the same myth as The Babe... the Myth of Baseball. \n", "test3_true": "MOM Guys, supper's ready. \nDAD (FORMERLY BILL) Give us another ten minutes. I'm helpin' my boy break in his new glove. \nINT. MR. MERTLE'S BASEBALL ROOM - DAY \nMr. Mertle sits contentedly behind his little \"diamond.\" The RADIO ANNOUNCER calls Maury Wills' 104th steal of 1962. \nMR. MERTLE'S DIAMOND \nHIS HAND moves a wooden figure from 1st to 2nd. This tactile \n\"playing field\" becomes... \nEXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY \n...this one, where the guys are playing ball. There's a new addition to their team. A mascot. A big mascot. \nHERCULES \nin a t-shirt and cap. \nTHE GUYS \nall play as if, somehow, this may be the last time they ever get to be a team. As they play, they're \"sponged\" from the PICTURE in this order: Yeah-Yeah, Repeat and Timmy, Ham, DeNunez, Bertram, Squints, Hercules, Scotty, Benny. \nNARRATOR That was the last summer that we all got to play together. (MORE) \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) But it would stay with us forever. (as they all dissolve:) Yeah-Yeah's parents shipped him off to military school. Timmy and Tommy grew up to build skyscrapers. Ham went to college and became a pediatrician. DeNunez played triple A ball and never got to the majors. Bertram got really into the sixities and no one ever saw him again. Squints grew up and married Wendy Peffercorn; they bought the Five & Dime and they still own it to this day. Hercules lived to be 199 years old... in human years. \nEveryone but Benny has vanished from the Sandlot. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) After Benny pickled the Beast, his reputation spread all over town. From then on he was known as Benny \"The Juet\" Rodriguez. \nBENNY'S P.F. FLYER \ncomes down on home plate and vanishes, leaving \nTHE SANDLOT \nempty. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) The nickname stuck with him the rest of his life. \nEXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE - PRESENT - DAY \nDodger stadium. A ROAR goes up inside the ballpark. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) (FAMILIAR) That's a triple, and that'll put the winning run on third, with two out in the bottom of the ninth. What a shot! \nEXT. DODGER STADIUM - INFIELD - DAY \nFrom the dugout, TOMMY LASORDA calls for a pinch runner. A PLAYER comes out of the dugout, stripping off his warm-up jacket. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Lasorda's sending in a pinch runner - and it'll be... (DRAMATIC PAUSE) I don't believe it! Lasorda's calling up the \"Old Man\" to pinch-run in the biggest clutch situation this season! They say the veteran's lost a step or two. But if I were you, I'd get ready for some fireworks. \nTHE CROWD \nis on its feet as 40-year-old BENNY \"THE JET\" RODRIGUEZ takes over third base from the PLAYER already there. They shake hands on the exchange. The 3rd base COACH walks over to The Jet. Pats him on the back. \nCOACH (GRINNING) Give 'em hell, Jet. \nTHE JET I'll do my best, Maury. \nThe Coach moves into the coaching box... turning his back to us. Emblazoned across his jersey, is the name W I L L S. \nTHE PITCHER \ntakes the signal. \nTHE JET \nleads off 3rd base - ten steps! The Pitcher fires to 3rd. The Jet hand tags. \nTHE PITCHER \nsettles. \nTHE JET \nleads off. Eleven steps. \nTHE PITCHER \nfires to 3rd again. The Jet gets back. \nTHE JET \nleads off again. Twelve steps. The pitch - strike. The CATCHER tosses it back. Just then... \n...The Jet moves. So fast that no one knows he's gone till it's too damn late. The Pitcher awkwardly throws home. The Catcher wipes the baseline. Too late... \n...the dust clears. The UMPIRE eagle-wings the air. \nUMPIRE SAFE! SAFE! SAFE! \nThe tag missed by two feet. It's all over. The Crowd jumps to its feet. The Dodger dugout is all over The Jet. \n", "test3_id": 2420}

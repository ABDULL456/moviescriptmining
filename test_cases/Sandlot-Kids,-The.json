{"test1_input": "THE GANG'S \nalready playing \"over the line.\" \nNARRATOR They never kept score. They never chose sides. They never even really stopped playing the game... it just went on forever. Everyday they picked up right where they left off the day before. It was an endless \"dream game.\" (BEAT) There was only 8 of them, so they didn't have a whole team. It didn't matter though... Benny was so good he took everyone's position when it was there ups. (BEAT) I didn't know any of that then... I just knew they were having the time of their lives and I wanted to be a part of it. \nSCOTTY \nwatches and listens (as he goes) to the SHARP, satisfying sound of the hardball, SNAPPING CLEANLY in the oily leather of their gloves. \nHE LOOKS AT \nhis own toy glove... how embarrassing. \nSCOTTY \ncontinues around the perimeter, trying to be seen and become invisible. He goes unwittingly CLOSER TO those green fiberglass panels. \nDENUNEZ \nwinds up and pitches to \nBENNY \nwho connects big. CRACK! \nSCOTTY'S \ncome too close to the green fence. Something has overcome him... fear! He stares with serious woollies at \nA HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS \nand sees only dust rising in time with some great, SOUNDS OF EXHALATION. And then, before he can draw any conclusions... disaster. \nGANG (O.S.) Hey! Look out! \nSCOTTY \nwhips a look up and sees \nTHE FLY BALL \ncoming right at him. \nSCOTTY \ntracks it, frozen stiff. Scared shitless. At the past possible moment, he throws his arms over his face and ducks... social suicide. \nTHE BALL \nbeans him at the glove covering his noggin. \nSCOTTY \nhits his butt. The ball rolls a bit. Comes to an \"I-dare- you\" stop: right up against the diseased fiberglass panels of that preternatural fence. Scotty pulls his arms away from his face. \nTHE GANG \nLAUGHS uproariously. \nTIMMY Nice catch! \nREPEAT Nice catch! \nHAM Hey! Throw the ball back! \nYEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, hurry up! \nBERTRAM We gotta a game here, man! \nSCOTTY \nmoves for the ball. As he goes, he sweats: \nSCOTTY 'Kay, I'll get it! (TO HIMSELF) Don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus. \nHe reaches the fence and the ball and stops. It's hard to move. The force emanating from the backyard has got him: \nDUST THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS \nkeeps perfect time with the monster-breathing. \nAN OLENADER BUSH \nmoves. It scares the living kapok out of \nSCOTTY \nwho snatches up the ball and back-pedals 10 feet. \nSQUINTS WE'RE WAITING... \nHe throws back the ball. And his chances of getting in with these guys are over. Because Scotty... throws like a girl! \nTHE BALL \ndroops forward in the air. Lands 6 feet from him. Rolls slowly up to the gang, finally coming to a dainty stop at DeNunez' feet. \nTHE GANG \n", "test1_true": "SCOTTY \nwalks away... crying. \nSCOTTY (TO HIMSELF) My life is over. \nBENNY \nis the only one that isn't laughing. He stares the others down. \nDENUNEZ Come on, Benny-man, didn't you see that throw? \nHe imitates it, \"flipping\" his glove to Ham. The gang BUSTS UP again. \nHAM (TRULY STUNNED) That kid's got the gaw'damn panty- waistiest arm I ever saw in my whole life. \nSQUINTS I seen a guy once that threw like that. I mean not that bad, but at least so bad that he hadda move in the fourth grade 'cause they nicknamed him \"Bloomers.\" \nBenny's look stifles the bunch. \nBENNY I bet not one of you knows how The Babe got his nickname. \nHAM Easy, 'cause of the way he looked like a little kid face. \nBERTRAM Bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids and stuff. \nSQUINTS Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe, because he was like the child of Yankee Stadium. \nBENNY I knew it. You're all full of crap. George Herman Ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage. \nSilence. None of the other guys has heard this before. \nBENNY (CONT'D) Nobody liked him there. The bigger guys picked on him all the time. And when they messed with him he couldn't fight back, 'cause he was just... like scared. So when they messed with him, he cried about it. (BEAT) He cried... so they called him The Babe. \nThis hits home real good. \nBENNY (CONT'D) How ya think that kid just felt? \nBenny exits the sandlot, leaving the others with a lesson learned. \nNARRATOR Everyone knew Benny was different. Nobody ever voted or anything, but he was the leader. \nEXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK \nAs Benny goes into his house, the other's round the corner far behind him. \nTHE MOON \nis up. Full. Like a big baseball. \nNARRATOR Even though he seemed like a regular guy, he wasn't. Benny was special, and he was loyal. (BEAT) When they'd all tried out for youth league, they'd all made it. But when they found out they'd have to play on different teams, Benny told 'em that if they couldn't play together, they shouldn't play at all. So, they stayed together. \nEXT./INT. BENNY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nBenny's at the window, clutching a baseball, staring over at Scotty's house. \nNARRATOR So, the only person that ever felt sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez. (BEAT) Even though neither of us knew it at the time, we were connected. Like I had been born for just that one moment, when I would perform the world's all- time boner, and Benny would bail me out. (BEAT) Connected as friends... born to meet for just that one moment. \nWe DRIFT OFF Benny to his PICTURE OF MAURY WILLS in a pickle. \nINT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY \nA PICTURE OF MAURY WILLS on a Post Super Sugar Crisp box. \nBILL & SCOTTY \nat the table. Bill sifting through mounds of paperwork. Scotty eating breakfast. Scotty's spoon CLANGS one too many times. Bill looks up at him. \nSCOTTY Sorry... \nScotty picks up his bowl and cereal, goes into \nINT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - DAY \nwhere his mom is making coffee. \nMOM (QUIETLY) Well?... \nSCOTTY He's too busy, Mom. \nMOM (ENCOURAGING) Go back in there and ask. He'll take the time. Go on. \nINT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY \nScotty comes back in. Stops mutely near Bill. Long, agonizing seconds pass. Finally: \nSCOTTY Um, Da - \nQuick look toward the kitchen, then: \nSCOTTY (CONT'D) (so Mom won't hear) - I mean, Bill. Could we... I mean could you, like you said - teach me to catch today? \nBILL Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta get this done. \nIt ain't much, but it's something. \nSCOTTY Okay, thanks. \n", "test1_id": 2418, "test2_input": "NARRATOR Benny would've played ball all day and all night... rain shine, tidal wave, whatever, it didn't matter. Baseball was the only thing he cared about and everything else was just a waste of time. (BEAT) But, of all the things we ever did besides baseball, goin' to the pool was what he tolerated best. Even though none of us had ever seen a Playboy magazine - which we constantly lied about - we figured the pool was the next best thing to being there. \nTHE GANG \ndunks each other, play \"attack-sub,\" etc... \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) It wasn't the Pool Honeys like we said, 'cause if any one of them had come up to any one of us, we'd of peed our pants. (BEAT) We went for... the Lifeguard. \nTHE LIFEGUARD \nis unbelievable. In fact, it's WENDY PEFFERCORN. She slides Coppertone up and down her legs. \nTHE GANG \none by one, stop foolin' around. Chest deep in the shallow end, they're a detached and frozen pocket of leering dopes.

She knows exactly what she's doing. \nSQUINTS I've swum here every summer of my adult life... and every summer there she is. (LOSING IT) Lotioning... oiling... smiling. (TEETH CLENCHED) I - can't - take - this - no - more! \nTHE GANG WATCHES AS SQUINTS \npushes through the water, pulls himself out, and walks really fast to the diving board (taking off his glasses to impress her as he passes.) \nSCOTTY What's wrong with him? \nYEAH-YEAH (WORRIED) Don't-know, but that's the deep end, and Squints can't swim! \nSQUINTS \nwalks the plank to the end. Looks wantingly toward \nTHE LIFEGUARD \nwho smiles back at him. \nSQUINTS \nholds his nose. Takes the deep leap. Hits the water and... \nUNDERWATER \n...sinks like a stone. Squints grins as he founders. \nTHE GANG \nlines the edge of the deep section. \nBERTRAM Squints! \nHAM Oh my God! He's drowning! \nTHE LIFEGUARD \nto the rescue. Seconds pass... she surfaces and lays a limp SQUINTS \nON THE DECK \nEverybody at the pool gathers 'round. The Lifeguard lays Squints flat. She administers mouth-to-mouth. \nThe gang watches on tense as hell. \nSquints peeks at them through a secretly opened eye. As the Lifeguard is \"saving\" his sneaky life, Squints can no longer restrain himself, he grabs her - gives her a sloppy SMOOCH! She tears away. Stands up over his wimpy little form: \nLIFEGUARD You little pervert! \nShe grabs Squints by the scruff of the neck. Run-walks him toward the exit, and... \nEXT. PUBLIC POOL - DAY \n...chucks his boney butt into the hedges. The guys scramble out, dragging their clothes after them. They help Squints up. \nHAM Did you plan that?! \nSQUINTS A'course I did.

Left Field is in the left. Double play gets two outs. Triple play is impossible. Single is good. Double is better. Home run is best.

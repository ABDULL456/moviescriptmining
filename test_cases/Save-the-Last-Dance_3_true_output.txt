PATRICK It's besides the point. Whatever point it is you tryin' to make. 
CHENILLE I'm sayin' you can't help who you love, Patrick. At least you found somebody who loves you back. 
Patrick regards Chenille impassively.    Hands Christopher to her. 
PATRICK I gotta go. 
CHENILLE To where? To who? Malakai? (sucks her teeth) You ain't through with that fool yet. 
PATRICK He's not a fool, Chenille. 
CHENILLE No. You know what? You're the fool, Patrick. You think you let Malakai down and all you did was try to pull yourself up. Ain't no blame or shame in that. 
PATRICK (very low; a broken smile) I still gotta go. Check you later. 
Holding Christopher, Chenille watches Patrick walk out of the playground. Disappear. She and Christopher move on to a seesaw. Chenille bobs him up and down on one end of it. She's snuggling in Christopher's face when the other end suddenly drops to the ground. Chenille looks up. Sees Kenny. 
168   EXT. PLAYGROUND - SWINGS - CHENILLE AND KENNY - LATER            168 
They're side by side on swings. Christopher's nestled against Kenny's chest, soundly snoozing. They slowly swing throughout. 
KENNY It cut me, what you said. 
(CONTINUED) 
168   CONTINUED:                                                            168 
CHENILLE (means this) I shouldn't have... I was trippin'. 
KENNY You always trip. I'm used to that. Besides, you were right. You were wrong, too. So was I. I need to do better. Ain't no doubt about that. 
CHENILLE I know I come down on you hard about money, but I would rather you spend the time. Seriously. 
KENNY (jokingly) So you don't want any money? 
CHENILLE I didn't say all that. 
He smiles. Gently rubs Christopher's brow.          Looks at her. Chenille smiles at him. 
KENNY I love my son, Chenille.    You know that, don't you? 
CHENILLE Yeah.   I always knew that.

of the building, the downtown skyline, etc. 
170   INT. BALTIMORE SCHOOL OF PERFORMING ARTS - AUDITORIUM -               170 SAME TIME 
The house lights      are on. Several seats in the front row are taken up by      judges for Juilliard. Further back are the families and      friends of other dancers. PUSH IN and FAVOR Roy among      them. 
171   INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - SARA                                            171 
Warming up, other dancers, all in costume, around her. Her eyes wander from the clock to the stage door. 
(CONTINUED) 
171   CONTINUED:                                                   171 
A sign on it reads: "JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE - BALTIMORE AUDITIONS." She stares at it, fingers the clover leaf necklace with an unsettling sense of deja vu. 
ANGLE - WOMAN 
with a PINCE-NEZ with a clipboard, navigating among the dancers with a clipboard. She calls out: 
PINCE-NEZ Johnson.   Sara Johnson... 
172   EXT. STREET (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS) - NIGHT                      172 
Patrick's waiting on the sidewalk. Malakai pulls up in Tute's BMW. Lip's in the backseat. Patrick gets into the car. It takes off down the street. 
173   EXT./INT. STREET - BMW - DRIVING - NIGHT                     173 
RAP MUSIC blasts ON the RADIO. No one in the car is saying anything. Malakai has a "40" between his legs. He sips from it, passes it to Patrick. Patrick takes a short swig, passes it back to Lip. As he does this, a set of keys fall out of his jacket into his lap. Patrick picks them up. Looks at the key chain, his present from Sara. He looks at Malakai. 
PATRICK Pull over. (as Malakai glances at him, not understanding) This ain't helpin' nobody, 'Kai. I'm out. I mean it. Stop the car. 
LIP Awww, shit.      Here we go. 
MALAKAI (furious) What you mean you out? You think I'ma let your punk ass bail on me again? 
Patrick starts to open the door. Malakai speeds up. The CAR CAREENS down the street, SQUEALS around corners. Finally comes to a red light. Stops. Patrick starts to open the door. Malakai grabs him by the jacket. Pulls his gun. Patrick looks at Malakai and now he sees him. Sees that he's lost and desperate... and dangerous.

PAUL Hi, great to meet you two. 
JULES I hope the traffic wasn't too bad. PAUL No, I've got my bike so...I just sort of weave through. 
Nic clocks the motorcycle, stifles the impulse to judge. NIC Great.   Well, come on in. 
As they enter, Paul holds out a bottle of wine. PAUL This is for you. I don't know if you guys like wine... Nic takes it. 
NIC Are you kidding? We love it. (checking the label) And a Petit Syrah. What a treat! Let me get some glasses. 
Nic leaves Paul by the stairs with Jules. Little silence. Jules steals a look at him, unable to contain her curiosity. 
PAUL Beautiful house.    How long you guys lived here? JULES Almost ten years. Wait, has it been that long? (rambling nervously) We moved right after Laser broke his leg, I remember that because we had a ramp for a while, so that would have been...ten, no, nine? No, ten years this fall. 
Paul nods, smiling at her nervousness. PAUL Okay. 
Laser and Joni enter. Joni lights up when she sees Paul. Jules watches Paul hug her. Uncomfortable, she heads for THE KITCHEN -- 
Jules finds Nic's pouring herself a sizable glass of wine. JULES You okay? 
NIC (not okay) Yeah. Fine. 
Jules feels her inner co-dependent swelling in her chest. 
JULES Go easy on the wine, hon.   It's day time. 
NIC Okay. And same goes for the micro- managing... 
EXT. ALLGOOD PORCH - AFTERNOON Everyone sits at the picnic table. 
JULES I hope the food's okay. Joni told us you own a restaurant. 
PAUL The food's great. Can't go wrong with salmon and corn. Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note. 
NIC So Paul, did you always know you wanted to be in food-services industry? 
Paul smiles at Nic, trying to disarm her. 
PAUL Well, I always liked food. NIC No, I was asking because I remember reading in your file, back when we were looking for, you know, sperm, anyway, you said you were studying international relations. 
PAUL Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time ago. Yeah, I was considering it, but then I dropped out of school. 
JONI You dropped out of college? PAUL Yeah, it wasn't my thing. 
NIC (squinching) No?    Why's that? 
PAUL It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while. I mean, I wasn't "doing" anything. I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas I could've just as easily learned reading a book. Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms. 
PAUL (CONT'D) I'm not saying higher learning uniformly sucks. I mean, college is great for some people. (MORE) PAUL (CONT'D) Joni, I'm sure you're gonna love it. That's just me. I'm just weird that way. (beat) Which is probably why I ended up in the food-services industry.

HARRY and FLASH and LIZ and KIM, (the EARTH is SHAKING) come out running from the building beneath an enormous HANGING MOON. They are frightened. 
Suddenly it all stops. It's quiet, the kids look at the sky. 
LIZ Look at the moon... I have never seen it so big. 
FLASH What is that... 
HARRY Must be the sun. 
We now see the sky. With the sun on one side, and the moon on the other. They watch it, shocked, frightened out of their wits. 
EXT. END OF THE WORLD MONTAGE - NIGHT 
Suddenly from OCK'S basement lab a BLUE BEAM of LIGHT breaks through. A WHINE starts, it moves magically out of the WINDOW and PANS around a sleepy NEW YORK which doesn't know that the end is upon it. The dreaded WHINE builds throughout! People stop in their tracks, look up to the strange looking skyline. Camera comes down to a street where ROZ is DRIVING SPIDER-MAN fast toward the UNIVERSITY. 
INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT 
ROZ looks out over the skyline of NEW YORK. Lighted buildings FLARE UP and then GO DARK. The LIGHTED SPIRE of the Empire State Building FLARES UP and EXPLODES. 
SPIDER-MAN It's started. Step on it Professor, or we'll never make it. 
They look across the campus and a strange LIGHT is coming out of the SCIENCE CENTER. 
ROZ Our campus... right there... see those beams from Ock's lab. We're late... it's coming... the Conjunction will happen in a few seconds. 
SPIDER-MAN massages his arm. 
SPIDER-MAN Stop the car...! Come with me. 
ROZ Where...? What...? 
SPIDER-MAN SHOOTS out a WEB and flies toward the SCHOOL BUILDING taking ROZ with him. 
INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT 
It is a patchwork of make-shift repairs. OCK looks in through a WINDOW that's been melted out. He is lost in a mad rapture. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
RED POWER THROTTLE is at 95% POWER! SPIDER-MAN and ROZ enter, shielding their eyes from the GLARE. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:08:18". 
OCK (looking back, madly) Aha! You never included the Conjunction in your calculations, did you?! Rosomorf! 
ROZ Damn the calculations! My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to... all the patterns, all the harmonies... everything will be destroyed. 
OCK A new world waits! Rosomorf! It is my destiny!!! 
ROZ It is cosmic suicide! You have no right! 
ROZ flings himself through the MELTED WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. He grabs for the "BULLET" but the WALDOS grab him and throw him back. ROZ staggers backward... into the arms of SPIDER-MAN. 
ROZ You have to stop him... Spider-Man you have to stop him. 
SPIDER-MAN I'm afraid we're too late. 
SPIDER-MAN attacks OCK, trying to push him away from the THROTTLE. OCK pushes SPIDER-MAN away from him so strongly that SPIDER-MAN is knocked down. OCK nudges the POWER THROTTLE forward and the WHINE increases to an ear shattering pitch. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:06:48". We are at 96% POWER! 
EXT. THE SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT 
We PAN down from the MOON to a STREET full of SIRENS and SHADOWY FIGURES running in the night. LIZ and KIM and HARRY come nearer. A very WEIRD light is emanating from the CENTER. 
LIZ He's in there. I know Peter is in there. She breaks into a run. 
FLASH Liz, don't... Liz come back... come back! LIZ runs inside. They run after her. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY flashes across the doorway, stopping them. 
INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
The PLANETS are playing on the COMPUTER SCREEN. Things in the room begin to rise, weightless. The ENERGY STORM is brewing! 
OCK Okey, dokey!! My energy storm has started. My Anti-Force is on! History is being made... Spider-Man, Rosomorf cheer up friends... we're on our way to the unknown cosmos... we three are about to visit heaven... real Gods heaven. 
ROZ (sees the sky through the window) Spider-Man! The Conjunction! It's happening! 
EXT. THE SKY - STRANGE COLORS - NIGHT 
The CONJUNCTION is now happening. 
INSERT: Surreal DIALS spin madly. 
INT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT 
LIZ runs into a HALLWAY gone berserk. Stuff is flying everywhere. TILES pull from the WALLS and crash to the ceiling. 
LIZ Peter! Peter, where are you?! 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

KEVIN I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix. 
KELLY Kevin, as long as we... (suddenly) What was that last part? 
KEVIN (sheepish) The somebody else part? 
KELLY Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um... 
KEVIN (feels terrible) Else. 
A beat. 
KELLY (covering) Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, you... you're y'know... 
KEVIN (reading her mind) A jerk. 
KELLY (you have no idea) Oh... (then) No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm... (checks her watch) I actually have an early lunch, so... 
KEVIN It's ten after nine. 
KELLY Yes, well... (smiling) famished. 
And she rushes out of the room.  OFF Kevin, we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY 
Walt dives down, visibility is lousy. Whether it's algae or dense vegetation, the water is extremely murky. 
EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS 
Keough unwraps the second Twinkie. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 
Walt continues to swim. 
HIS P.O.V. 
Not much to look at.  Then suddenly... no, just a snapping turtle swimming away.  Walt descends a little deeper.  He loves it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere else.  Next best thing to meditation.  Suddenly, he stops kicking. 
HIS EYES FOCUS 
A black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length. 
RESUME 
Walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look.  The snake seems unimpressed.  Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him, misses.  Shit.  Walt's look says "what the fuck?"  A beat.  Then the snake swims off.  Walt relaxes.  A beat.  But then... he looks around, uneasy.  He gets this feeling he's not alone down there.  Looks about, nothing but murky water.  But he's not alone, we can feel he's not alone. 
He looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering, looking back at him.  What's with these snakes?  Walt decides he'll go back to the boat.  Then... BOOM.  Something hits him... and it's no snake. 
EXT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS 
Keough.  Oblivious.  Waiting.  Suddenly-- Walt comes thrusting up with a scream! 
WALT Sheriff!! 
And Walt is promptly yanked back under. 
KEOUGH Hey! 
Upon which Walt surfaces.  He swims frantically for a beat before he's suddenly yanked under again.  Then he surfaces, thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat.  He takes hold of him and pulls him on board.  Actually... what's left of him. There's nothing below the waist.  Walt is just a bleeding torso, though still conscious. 
KEOUGH (CONT'D) (going into shock) Jesus Christ.

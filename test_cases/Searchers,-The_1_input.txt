EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LOW ANGLE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - 
AFTERNOON 
It is a portrait study of two faces -- etched by wind and privation and cold into tragic, fanatic masks. 
Martin has aged years in a matter of months. Falling snow flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly beards. 
MARTIN (bitterly) Say it. We're beat! 
ETHAN (slowly) No... our turnin' back don't change anything... not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe... for a while... They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to... 
He turns his mount. 
MARTIN And you think we got a chance to find her? 
ETHAN An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough... Then he quits... Same when he runs... Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on... So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that... We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.

FADE IN 
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE AND APPROACH - WIDE ANGLE - 
TWILIGHT 
The time is spring. It is a year and a half later. 
The Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place -- of sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room, the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen brood. A meadowlark breaks into his sudden song. A dog or two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and Martin ride slowly from behind CAMERA toward the house. In that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars Jorgensen comes to the door. 
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NEAR DOOR - TWILIGHT 
Jorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up - recognizing them, of course, but ill-prepared for the change in their appearance and full of unspoken questions. 
Bearing a lamp, Mrs. Jorgensen hurries out to stand beside her husband -- and her face works and tears begin to well in her eyes. Two tow-headed boys -- 13 or 14 -- come after her. Jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand, not even looking at the boys, and they hurry out to take the reins as Ethan and Martin dismount. 
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN 
The passage of time has stamped Martin -- and will continue during our story more and more to stamp him -- in the image of Ethan. Now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or paucity of speech). Neither man is sure of his reception. They are thinking of Brad -- dead because of their search; and Martin is thinking of Laurie. And then Mrs. Jorgensen is running across to Martin and has him in her arms as though he were her son -- saying nothing, just holding him. He stands frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace. Ethan watches a moment, then crosses to Jorgensen. 
ETHAN (to Jorgensen) You got my letter about your son, Brad? 
JORGENSEN Yah... Just about this time a year ago... 
MRS. JORGENSEN It came the day before his... birthday. 
JORGENSEN The Lord giveth--the Lord taketh away... 
Mrs. Jorgensen starts to lead the way inside. Martin hangs back. 
MARTIN I ain't fit to go indoors, miz Jorgensen... These clothes is... 
Laurie rushes past her mother. 
LAURIE Martie! 
She kisses him hard and full on the mouth -- and has no eyes for anyone else. Mrs. Jorgensen looks on with amusement. Martin is just bowled over. 
MRS. JORGENSEN (teasing) And him probably forgettin' all about you!... Probably can't even call your name to mind. 
MARTIN (smiling) Laurie. 
And Laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother. 
MARTIN (continuing) But I fairly forgot just how pretty you was... 
Laurie grabs his hand then and pulls him indoors -- and there is no further resistance from Martin. 
Mrs. Jorgensen and her husband converge then on Ethan -- and her face is gravely questioning. 
MRS. JORGENSEN The little one?... Debbie? 
Ethan shakes his head. She squeezes his arm reassuringly and they start indoors. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THE SPARE BEDROOM OF THE JORGENSEN'S - MED. SHOT - 
MARTIN - NIGHT 
This is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room -- 
and described in the book as the "grandmother room": with narrow, slit-like windows, a set of single bunk beds, possibly a fireplace. 
Martin is in a deep wooden tub, taking a hot bath, currying his back with a long-handled brush. Beyond him is the door. It opens and Martin turns casually -- and at once stops being casual as Laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered. 
MARTIN Hey... What you doin'...? 
She picks up the shirt, puts it over one arm; she reaches for his long-handled and ragged underwear, runs a fist through a hole in its seat, clucks and shreds it into rags. During this: 
MARTIN (a yelp) Don't go takin' that stuff... 
LAURIE Ain't worth the mendin'... 
She turns and looks at him, matter of fact. 
LAURIE What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?... I have brothers, haven't I?

The same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence. Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands. 
138  HIS POV                                                      138 
Flynn's hands are glowing, electrified. 
139  CLOSE SHOT                                                   139 
of his face. His head comes up and we see an expression of terrible understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening of the neighboring cell. 
140  INT. NEXT CELL - RAM'S                                       140 
Ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from Tron's. 
RAM (looking over his shoulder) New guy... 
TRON (shakes his head) Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ? 
RAM (sighs) The Users...you really think they're still there? 
TRON They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me. 
141  FLYNN'S CELL                                                 141 
He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back, so he goes to the window and tries to reach through. 
FLYNN Hey! Who are you guys? What's the story around here? 
But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells, it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock. 
142  RAM                                                          142 
turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise. 
RAM You want to watch those force fields... 
He goes to the window opening. 
RAM (CONT.) You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that. 
FLYNN Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I? 
RAM You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games. 
FLYNN (relieved) Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody. 
Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything, there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell opens. 
143  THE CORRIDOR                                                 143 
we see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the opposite direction. 
CUT TO: 
144  TRAINING ARENA                                               144 
A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of them. Flynn is in the front of the line. 
HEAD GUARD Look operative, you guys. Command Program Sark will explain the training procedures. 
Sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is amplified over the grid. 
SARK (reciting a routine statement) Greetings. The Master Control Program has chosen you to serve your system on the Came Grid.

Sark, looking out over the grid. 
SARK Those of you who continue to profess a belief in the Users will receive the standard substandard training. This will result in your eventual elimination.

Looking down into the game arenas at his feet and over at one of the conscripts next to him. 
SARK V.0. Those of you who renounce this superstitious and hysterical belief will be eligible to join the Warrior Elite of the MCP.

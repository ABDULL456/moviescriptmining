Hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out. 
OUTSIDE. The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full sprint through the 100 MPH winds. He tears his clothes off and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him. 
WINK (CONT'D) Look at me! Look at me Hushpuppy! Watch me kick butt. 
Wink fires his shotgun at the heavens. 
WINK (CONT'D) Hell yea! I'm right here! I'm right here I ain't going nowhere. AHHHHHH!!! 
A THUNDER CLAP shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam CRASHES down. 
Hushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe. 
Windell, swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling, BARKS, panicking herself. 
HUSHPUPPY Mamma!? MAMMA!? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PATAGONIAN COAST - NIGHT 
Still in the rainstorm, a glacial cube SHATTERS, flopping a mammoth body onto the shoreline. 
It's chest heaves and a LOW SNORT is heard. The animal begins to roll over. 
Her dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts herself up. We stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she stares into the distance. 
The massive creature turns, testing her limbs after thousands of years of sleep. 
She looks up to the storm and lets loose a GURGLING ROAR. 
We sit close on one of her black eyes. There is something dangerously sad in her cold gaze. Her head moves from the frame as she starts forward on her journey. 
EXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY 
Silence. The storm has passed. 
The camera flies high over the Bathtub. The tops of houses poke out from the massive water like lily-pads in a pond. 
EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - FLOODED - MORNING 
A slab of metal stares at us, surrounded by water. 
Something under the metal BANGS TWICE and an axe dislodges a roof panel. The axe twists and leverages off the slab. 
Wink hefts Hushpuppy on top of the roof. Then Windell. Dishevelled and hung-over, he pulls himself up too. 
The three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new world. 
EXT. FLOODED LAFOURCHE ROAD - TURCK - MORNING 
Wink slowly navigates the Turck in through the flooded landscape where their town had once been. Neither he nor Hushpuppy can say a word. Everything is submerged. Every organism is dead or has fled. The quiet is overwhelming. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) For every animal that didn't have a Dad to put it in a boat, the end of the world already happened. They're all down below, trying to breathe through water. 
They pass abandoned house, after abandoned house, the ones on stilts have water up to the porches. Trees are bashed through roofs, walls are blown through, bathrooms exposed.

And is hit hard by the sight of DROWNED JULIA, her motionless body floating past him.  HER EYES OPEN and bubbles drift from her nose and mouth.  Novak BANGS on the Plexiglas and calls to her. 
NOVAK JULIA! 
The thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) MOVE ASIDE! 
He pulls his gun and takes aim.  Julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling.  BANG-BANG BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.  Novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic.  Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is still solid.  He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the bullet-damaged section.  CRACK! CRASH!  WATER POURS FROM THE CELL.  Julia's body descends on the torrent of water.  Novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety.  He's just about to give her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks in oxygen.  Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor, the water from the cell spilling everywhere. 
EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE 
Cole's Suburban leads a contingent of FBI vehicles and local police cars onto the property, sirens blaring. 
INT. THE CELL - DAY 
Hearing the sirens, Novak relaxes.  For the first time in god knows how long, he relaxes.  And holds Julia Hickson as if his life depended on it. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Two cars parked outside.  An old, quirky Volvo and a Land Rover. 
INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY 
As a television plays THE WIZARD OF OZ, we find Catherine watching the movie from the couch, sitting up, drinking a cup of tea.  She looks rested and quite cute in gym shorts and a T-shirt, her CAT sleeping next to her.  IN THE KITCHEN, Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor, moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies... 
MIRIAM I left the nutritional information on the fridge door.  Read it. 
Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie. Miriam deposits prescription bottles onto a side table. 
MIRIAM (CONT'D) I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan... 
CATHERINE I don't need them anymore... 
MIRIAM I know. 
But she leaves them just the same. 
MIRIAM (CONT'D) I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner. 
CATHERINE Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and... 
MIRIAM ...give a kiss to Edward. 
CATHERINE (overlapping) Give a kiss to Edward. 
The women exchange smiles and Miriam exits. 
EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE 
As Miriam walks to her Land Rover, she sees a government issue Suburban park on the street and Peter Novak exit. 
MIRIAM Agent Novak. 
NOVAK Dr. Kent. 
MIRIAM You're looking well. 
NOVAK Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good. (conspiratorially) I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.

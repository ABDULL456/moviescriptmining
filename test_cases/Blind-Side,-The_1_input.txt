NICK SABAN And you must be Leigh Anne. 
LEIGH ANNE Yes, Coach Saban, that's me. Leigh Anne. Touhy. 
NICK SABAN Please, call me Nick. What an incredible home. Love the Windsor valances. 
LEIGH ANNE

NICK SABAN (CONT'D) 
(EYEING MICHAEL) And I know it when I see it. (offers a hand) Michael, I'm Nick Saban. And you must be SJ. I hear you have quite a jump shot, young man. 
LEIGH ANNE Nick, why don't you and Michael go into the living room to talk. 
MICHAEL Can SJ come?

Michael and SJ sit across from Saban. 
SABAN So, as soon as possible we'd like to get you down to Baton Rouge. We've got a great thing going, Michael and we plan on winning a bunch more National Championships. Whattaya' say, will you commit to a visit? Michael turns to SJ, who raises his hand. 
SI Can I ask a question? 
SABAN Sure. 
SJ My brother and me are very close. I'm worried that if he goes off to school I won't see him so... 
SABAN Go on. 
SI I guess I was just wondering how much access I'd have to him. Saban smiles at the kid's moxie. 
SABAN Tell you what, SJ. Michael comes to LSU I'll get you an all-access pass. How's that sound? 
SJ Sounds good.

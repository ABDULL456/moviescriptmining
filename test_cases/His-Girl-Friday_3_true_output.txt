BURNS (round-eyed) Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life! 
MRS. BALDWIN Oh, what a thing to say! I was standing right here - after the girl jumped out of the window. 
HARTMAN Did you get the Mayor? 
DEPUTY He's coming over. 
BURNS (to Mrs. Baldwin) Now, Madam -- be honest. If you were out joy-riding, drunk, and got into some scrape, why don't you admit it, instead of accusing innocent people? 
MRS. BALDWIN (beginning to doubt her senses) You ruffian! How dare you say a thing like that? 
HILDA Please, Mother, he's just crazy! 
MRS. BALDWIN (to Sheriff) I'll tell you something more. I'll tell you why they did it! 
BURNS (fidgeting) Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail. 
MRS. BALDWIN (continuing crescendo) I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him! 
This is a bombshell. The room is electrified. 
HARTMAN Hiding him? In here? 
Murphy, followed by the reporters, comes into scene. 
MURPHY Hiding him where? 
HILDY Mother! 
REPORTERS Where was he?... Where'd they have him?... Etc. 
CLOSE SHOT BURNS 
at the desk. 
BURNS (with superb indignation) Madam, you're a cockeyed liar! And you know it! 
To emphasize his righteousness, he pounds on the desk three times, forgetting that that is his signal to Williams. Then, realizing what he has done, he gasps. 
MED. SHOT 
Burns advances from desk, the others retreating before him. 
BURNS (anxiously) Come on, Sheriff, we've got to get bail. 
Three answering knocks come from the desk. 
GROUP SHOT WITH DOORWAY IN B.G 
They jump around to face the desk. 
HARTMAN (whispering) What was that? 
REPORTERS AD LIB He's in the desk! -- For the love of -- He's in there! Etc. 
HARTMAN Aha! I thought so! Stand back, everybody! 
DEPUTY Look out, Sheriff. He may shoot! 
HARTMAN Get your guns out! 
The policemen and deputies get out their guns. 
HILDY He's harmless. 
HARTMAN Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk. 
HILDY He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun. 
MRS. BALDWIN (panic-stricken) Oh, dear! Oh, dear! 
BURNS You grey-haired old Judas! 
MRS. BALDWIN Let me out! Let me out of here! 
She streaks for the door, flings it open and goes. The reporters tear out of scene to their telephones. 
HARTMAN (to policeman) You stand there! 
MURPHY'S VOICE City Desk! Quick! 
SCHWARTZ' VOICE Gimme the Desk! 
HARTMAN (to another policeman) You there! 
ENDICOTT'S VOICE City Desk! Hurry! 
MCCUE'S VOICE Gimme Emil... 
HARTMAN (to a Deputy, pointing with his gun toward the window) You cover the window. 
MURPHY'S VOICE Look out where you're pointing that gun! 
The Sheriff draws his men in around the desk, their guns drawn on it. 
WILSON'S VOICE Lemme have the Desk! Quick! 
MURPHY'S VOICE Hold the wire! I've got a flash for you! 
BURNS (to Hildy) Call Duffy! 
HARTMAN No, you don't! 
BURNS (to Sheriff, furiously) Do you want to get us scooped? 
MCCUE'S VOICE Emil? Hang on for a second. 
HARTMAN Now then, everybody aim at the center. And when I say three -- 
HILDY That's murder! 
HARTMAN (changing his mind) All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover. 
They do. 
HARTMAN Now then! We got you covered, Williams. Don't try to move. Now! Everybody quiet and ready for an emergency. I'm going to count three. 
SCHWARTZ Hold it! Something coming up. 
HARTMAN One! 
ENDICOTT Hold the phone! 
MURPHY (into the phone) I'll have it in a minute.

INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY 
A garage dealing exclusively in imports. Memphis enters... 
MEMPHIS Hello -- ? 
Sway slides out from beneath a Testarosa ... In her greasy coveralls, hair tied back, a motorhead's dream girl ... 
SWAY Hey. 
MEMPHIS What's wrong with her -- ? 
SWAY The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno... 
And she goes to the sink... 
SWAY (cont'd) You know Annie's trouble 
MEMPHIS Annie -- ? 
SWAY You haven't been studying -- 
She gestures to where the LIST of 50 is on the counter. 
SWAY (cont'd) 137 Roadster. Custom. Lives at 1443 Locklin in Rancho Palos Verdes ... 
MEMPHIS Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself 
SWAY She was the only "Annie" you could find? 
MEMPHIS They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area... 
SWAY Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ... 
As she speaks we CUT TO: 
EXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - RANCHO PALOS VERDES - DAY 
A massive house of glass and steel in a fancy neighborhood. We MOVE FOR THE HOUSE. Over the fine-trimmed lawn. 
SWAY (O.S.) ... and he keeps "Annie' in his living room... Like a work of art ... 
INTO THE SPARTAN LIVING ROOM... 
Massive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall ... Surround the yellow ROADSTER, which sits up on a platform ... Check out JUDGE CROFT, a nasty fat man in his late 50s ... He sits in the nearly empty room... A complex system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster 
SWAY (O.S.) She's got 27 miles on her o-dom. Which is exactly how far away the custom shop was in 1979 when he bought her... He drove her home, never drove her again ... 
The judge gazes at the car, admiring its jet-pod taillamps... A MAID comes in with a tray of tea service ... The maid crosses the Judge's line of sight... Watch as he curses her out, his face going beet red with fury... 
SWAY (O.S.) The man's a freak...

Sway looks at Memphis ... 
SWAY She's trouble -- 
MEMPHIS I put the boys on it. They're clever that way... 
She nods ... Long look ... 
SWAY I go with you -- 
MEMPHIS That what you want? 
SWAY That's what I want ... 
MEMPHIS Okay. 
She hits the Lava soap and starts washing the grease from her hands ... 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) I missed you, you know - 
SWAY You mentioned that in your letters 
MEMPHIS I always thought you'd follow me up. 
She shuts off the taps ... Towels her hands... 
SWAY We were good when you bailed, weren't we? 
MEMPHIS Very good... 
SWAY Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process. 
MEMPHIS No way ... 
SWAY No ... ? 
MEMPHIS No ... 
And he holds out a hand to her ... And she puts her greasesmeared towel into it ... 
SWAY Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps! 
MEMPHIS Oh. Okay. Right. 
EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY 
Memphis walks out... Going over to the PARKED CAR across the street ... Castlebeck... 
MEMPHIS I'm on the move - 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Your girl works in there ...

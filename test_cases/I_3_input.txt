RICHIE Heads up, homeschool! 
MIKE Eat me, townie! 
EXT. KISSING BRIDGE - DAY 
Travis, Snatch, Victor, and Hockstettler are still looking for the knife in the water under the bridge. 
SNATCH It probably got washed away, Travis. 
Travis grabs Victor by his collar and growls in his face. 
TRAVIS It ain't been washed away.     It's been stolen. 
VICTOR Stolen, by who? 
Travis points up the embankment at Mike, biking home over the bridge. 
TRAVIS That nigger right there. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 
Mike bikes home, sucking on the lollypop, when he notices something coming up fast behind him. 
TRAVIS and his boys in a beat up Trans Am. 
He starts peddling faster. Sees the KITCHENER IRONWORKS sign ahead and skids right down its path towards the ghostly titanic ruin. 
EXT. FIELD - KITCHENER IRONWORKS - DAY 
Mike looks around for a place to hide, a bird spooking off from the twisted carcass of the factory building. The Penobscot River flows behind. 
Travis and his boys skid to a stop in the field, machinery blocks their pursuit by car so they jump out on foot. 
Mike finds a SMOKESTACK laying in shattered sections in the grass. He stares into its big black bore, picks up a loose tile, and pitches it in. It lands with a faint echo in the darkness. 
INT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS - MOMENTS LATER 
Travis, Snatch, Victor and Hockstettler search for Mike in the SKELETAL REMAINS of the old ironworks structure itself, an open wound of twisted iron beams. 
Oblivious to any danger other than their own volatile potential, we get a sense that around every corner, some ominous figure is just ducking out of sight. 
Mike clocks them from inside the smokestack, the dodges around the perimeter of the ironworks structure. 
He nears the CELLAR HOLD, a yawning chasm on the edge of the ruins. Sees a Derry Historical Society PLAQUE: 
ON THESE PREMISES AN EXPLOSION TOOK THE LIVES OF 102 SOULS (88 CHILDREN) EASTER SUNDAY, 1906. MAY THEY REST IN PEACE 
PENNYWISE appears across the cellar hold OVER HIS SHOULDER. When Mike looks up from reading Pennywise IS GONE. 
Mike looks back across the weedy field to THE FENCE, his bike still leaned against it. It seems a million miles off. 
EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Travis and the boys continue to explore the far side of the factory, sensing Mike may have made a run for the river. 
INT./EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Sensing an opportunity, Mike books it back to his bike. 
INT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Hockstettler notices something off screen.    Walks towards it. 
Following Hockstettler we see what he sees: a lone BALLOON, as if just leaving the grasp of a child, floating up in the air. 
HOCKSTETTLER What the fuh... 
He looks back at Travis and the others, who are sniffing out the weeds near the river. 
EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Mike gets to his bike and starts pushing it up the hill. He looks back towards the factory. Travis and his boys still haven't come back to their car. Mike pedals home. 
INT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Travis, angry they didn't find Mike huffs back across the field, throwing a piece of scrap pipe he found against a giant corrugated wall. The entire factory vibrates with the gonging sound. 
TRAVIS Let's go! That jungle monkey ain't here no more. 
Travis walks obliviously past AN EASTER EGG, smeared with bloody fingerprints, but Hockstettler sees it, picks it up. 
HOCKSTETTLER I'm staying. 
The three of them turn towards Hockstettler like he's insane. 
TRAVIS Why? 
HOCKSTETTLER I don't know. (LAUGHING) I want to see its insides. 
He points towards the door leading to the dark innards of the factory. 
HOCKSTETTLER (CONT'D) You guys want to come? 
TRAVIS (DISGUSTED) Why the- Hell no. You mental? This place gives me the creeps. 
EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Travis and the others load up and peel off in their car. 
Hockstettler watches them leave, a cloud of dust in their place, then turns towards the darkest parts of the factory, as if pulled deeper into the core unconsciously. 
ANGLE OVER CELLAR HOLD, Hockstettler peers in.   He grabs a handhold and sways over its cavernous depth.

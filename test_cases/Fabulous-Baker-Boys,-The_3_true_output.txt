SUSIE No kidding? 
It's a small phone booth. 
SUSIE (continuing) The both of them?  In there? 
JACK He called her. 
SUSIE Oh. So what's it doing here? 
JACK Long story. 
SUSIE You sending me home? 
Jack locks eyes with Susie, then glances away. 
JACK They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous. 
SUSIE Nervous? 
JACK By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition. 
SUSIE You're kidding. 
JACK He had a mind that escalated things. 
SUSIE So, what happened? 
JACK He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb. 
Susie blinks. 
JACK (continuing) I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her. 
SUSIE Wow.  But I still don't see how ... 
JACK Ma didn't want it around.  After. 
SUSIE Oh. 
Jack glances out the window. 
SUSIE (continuing, carefully) Frank said you saw him die. 
Jack glances up quickly, surprised.  He nods. 
SUSIE (continuing) Frank said --- 
JACK Frank wasn't 'there. 
Susie stops, looks down.  Jack studies her for a moment, then decides. 
JACK He took me out to the docks one day.  We did that a lot.  There were other places, but he loved the ocean. He'd worked boats as a kid.  Never got rid of it. It was always in him.  He'd drink a little when we'd go.  If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig. To make me laugh. (pause) He drank a lot that day. 
Susie studies Jack as he stares into his glass. 
JACK (continuing) There was a lot of wind.  He was up on this cargo shelf, right over the ocean.  And he started to do the jig.  One minute he was there ... (shrugs) I thought it was a joke at first. He did things like that.  Games. (pause) I was laughing when it happened. 
Jack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances up and catches Susie looking at him. 
JACK You got pretty eyes, you know that. 
INT.  JACK'S BEDROOM 
Jack's bed.  In the darkness, we see Susie's profile, her eyes looking up toward the ceiling.  Jack's body falls slowly across her and he kisses her neck. 
EXT.  JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING 
We see Eddie, wearing his Christmas sweater, sleeping on the fire escape. 
INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Susie is dressed, sitting at the piano, staring out the window as she absently hits a key.  She is smoking one of Jack's cigarettes.  Distracted.  Jack comes to the doorway and watches her.  Plink.  Plink.  Plink. 
JACK You gotta move 'em around if you want to play a song. 
Susie starts, looks at her hand on the piano, pulls it away. 
SUSIE Oh. Hi.  Sorry. 
JACK Coffee? 
SUSIE Yeah... No. 
JACK Look, if you want to leave... 
SUSIE Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes! 
Susie throws the cigarette out the window, then looks down. 
SUSIE (continuing) Shit.  I think I started a fire. 
JACK If our feet get hot, you grab the piano. 
Susie smiles weakly. 
JACK (continuing) Why don't you go.  I'll see you tomorrow night at the Ambassador. 
Susie doesn't move. 
SUSIE I followed you last night.  I mean, I was here.  Outside.  I was about to come up when you came out. 
Jack waits.

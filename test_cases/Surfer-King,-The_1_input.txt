(shaking his head) You're not gonna believe it... 
AOKEE Listen. Some guy came in today and try to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone card. Today I believe anything. 
ALEX I took Robbie to The Wave today. 
AOKEE (looking around) What? He drown? 
ALEX No. It turns out that he's from Oceanside. California. You know, where they always hold those surf competitions? 
AOKEE Yeah.   So? 
ALEX It turns out that he placed second in the state high school finals for the shortboard competition. As a Sophomore. 
AOKEE Robbie. (laughing in disbelief, dismissive, then serious) Robbie barely walk without help. 
ALEX I saw it myself.      You wouldn't believe it. 
We hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen.      AOKEE winces and gestures toward the kitchen. 
AOKEE I don' believe it.      Our Robbie? 
ALEX Our Robbie. 
AOKEE (thinking) If this true....this could be da year. 
ALEX That's what I was thinking. 
AOKEE Well, go get him. We need to make ready. He not just walk in and win this thing. 
ALEX You heard it. He's in the kitchen...

ALEX goes into the back. AOKEE sits at a table. Robbie comes out of the kitchen wearing a dishwasher apron. 
AOKEE Robbie, sit down. Alex, make up a Volcano. This boy in training. 
ROBBIE (sitting down, worried) What did I spill now? 
WE HEAR the whine of a blender as ALEX is working on the Volcano Smoothie. 
AOKEE Robbie, Alex tell me you are some kind of surfer. This true? 
ROBBIE I dunno. Yeah, surfing is usually how I spend my summers. 
AOKEE You know about Employee Olympics? 
ROBBIE Yeah.   Some kind of trophy. 
AOKEE Surfer King trophy. Very big.     Very nice. (looking down) Concessions never win. 
ALEX arrives with the Volcano Smoothie. He turns a chair around and sits. They will gang up on him. 
ROBBIE I dunno...seems kind of silly to me. 
ALEX It's a big deal. Every girl     wants to date you. Every guy wants to BE      you. Special privileges...we all     wear standard uniforms.   The Surfer King     gets to be creative. You ever see the      cowboy hat Cowboy wears? 
ROBBIE It shouldn't be that hard...how good could this Cowboy be? 
AOKEE He very good. His family go to Hawaii every year, two, three weeks. Good surfer. If you do this, you need to see Pipeman.

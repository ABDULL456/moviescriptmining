Hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street. Traffic passes around them. Some cars come to a complete stop. 
Hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of the street and the three continue their silent walk with Grandma. 
In slow motion the three walk. Dad puts his arm around TJ's shoulders, TJ puts his arm around Dad's. 
And then a cop car cruises beside them slow. The cops inside watch them. Dad looks over. One of the cops smiles. 
EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - EVENING 
The cop car pulls up outside the house. The back door opens and Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk, still very drunk. Dad climbs out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet. A cop speaks to them from the open window. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
OFFICER (SMILING) You'll get him to bed now, won't you? 
DAD That's the plan. 
Hesher squirms and slurs. 
HESHER Get your hands off me, pig. 
DAD That's the plan. 
The cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away. TJ and Dad help Hesher across the lawn to the front door. We hold on the house for a beat. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING 
Close on scissors to beard. 
Dad stands over the sink cutting away at his beard. Golden sunlight pours in through the windows. 
A moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - MORNING 
There's a gentle knock at the door. TJ wakes and makes a big stretch. His hair's a mess. 
TJ Come in. 
Dad enters, he's clean-shaven now. He looks like a new man. 
DAD Morning, Teej. 
TJ Hey. Look at you. 
DAD I know. It feels weird. I can feel air on my face. 
TJ I hardly recognize you. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DAD I think Hesher's gone. 
TJ Gone where? 
DAD I don't know. But I think you should come take a look at this. 
EXT. FORNEY HOUSE / GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
The garage door is open. The garage is flooded with daylight and no sign of Hesher. 
TJ and Dad walks across the garage to the open door. At the garage's entrance they stop. Their eyes register something seriously unusual outside. 
'Master of Puppets' by Metallica punches in. LOUD. 
A giant red cube of Volvo scrap metal has been placed in the center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art. They stand and stare at it, almost in awe. 
Then from the across the street, we see the object in the driveway and TJ and Dad on the porch looking at it. 
We also see the words 'HESHER WAS HERE!' spray painted on the front of the house in big letters, as yet unseen by TJ and Dad. Dad puts his arm around TJ's shoulders. 
On the beat we CUT TO: 
HESHER MOMENTS: 
Hesher ripping on the guitar; Hesher blowing something up; Hesher cupping a fart and putting it in TJ's face; Hesher pantsing Dad; Hesher metal saluting Grandma and Grandma saluting him back. 
Hesher behind the wheel of his van, smoking a cigarette and making a direct line for the setting sun. 
A mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human, shelling a peanut. He throws the shell over his shoulder watching the setting sun. 
CUT TO BLACK: 
THE END

MURPHY Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake. 
GREER All I gotta say is it looks like that somebody's us right now. 
Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge. 
EPPS And it looks like somebody got here before us too. 
The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it back from the wall. 
DODGE (inspecting it) Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat. 
MURPHY Then it happened before they scuttled her. 
EPPS You mean, before she sank. 
GREER Cargo like this could make a crew think twice. 
MURPHY That it could. 
A beat, as they all look on at the gold. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT 
After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the galley table. 
GREER Then why didn't they take it. 
EPPS Probably didn't have time. 
DODGE Or somebody stopped them. 
MURPHY Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason. 
GREER Must be a damn good reason to jump ship and leave fifty million dollars aboard. 
A beat as they consider it. 
DODGE So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right? 
MURPHY A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours. 
DODGE Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich. 
MURPHY It looks like it. 
A beat as they let this sink in. 
GREER So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on? 
MURPHY We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan. 
DODGE You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks? 
MURPHY So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is. 
GREER Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka. 
MURPHY It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage. 
EPPS Why not call for help? 
MURPHY For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this. 
DODGE Last thing we want is extra partners. 
EPPS Or uninvited guests. 
GREER I heard that. 
MURPHY Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs. 
DODGE Yeah, yeah. I'm on it. 
MURPHY The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY 
Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum fitting over one of the open turbines. 
INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY 
Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space beyond the twisted hatch. 
GREER Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one. (as Epps stacks the last one) Two twenty two. 
Greer makes a note. 
GREER Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.

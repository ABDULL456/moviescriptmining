CUTTER In a word, yes. I'm surprised, to be honest- it usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out. 
ANGIER How much does he want? 
CUTTER It makes no difference- we have to stop doing the trick. 
ANGIER 
(WIELDS PAPER) Stop doing the trick? Look at this. 
CUTTER Look at yesterday's. And last week's, where they called you "London's premiere stage performer", not "magician" mind. Performer. Of any kind. 
ANGIER What's the point? 
CUTTER My point, Robert, is that you've climbed too high to get away with any kind of professional embarrassament. We're not doing any tricks we can't control. Angier considers this. Nods. Thinking. 
ANGIER Pay him whatever he wants, for now. We keep doing the trick till Borden opens, then we'll phase it out. 
INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE -- NIGHT 
Root smokes a cigarette. PULL BACK to reveal he is standing on the LIFT beneath the stage... The trapdoor OPENS and Angier DROPS onto the straw mattress. He looks over to see Root finishing his cigarette. 
ANGIER 
(HISSES) Get up there!! Root smirks at Angier- TOSSES the cigarette and CATAPULTS up- 
INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS 
-onto the stage and STEPS/STUMBLES out from behind the door to LOUD APPLAUSE. 
Root has a SLOPPY GRIN as he STRUTS acroos the stage, milking the applause from every angle, blowing kisses, winking... loving it. He turns to Cutter in the wings. Blows him a kiss. 
Cutter GLARES. Then TURNS to a stagehand. 
CUTTER Get it down! 
ANGIER (V.O.) Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad. 
The stagehand starts LOWERING THE CURTAIN. 
INT. RESTAURANT, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- DAY 
Angier sits with Borden's dairy. 
ANGIER (V.O.) We paid him enough to keep him in beer- you wouldn't expect him to rock the boat. Today I learned Borden's view on the episode... 
INT. TAVERN -- EVENING 
The bar is dark and seedy, packed with an unpromising lot. 
ANGIER (V.O.) ...and his account suggests a reason. 
Root is hanging precariously from his barstool, head lolling towards his empty glass. He is in his own clothes, but cleaned up to look like Angier. 
A full PINT arrives in front of him. Root turns to face his benefactor- BORDEN. Root takes several large GULPS, staring at Borden. Suppresses a belch. 
ROOT To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale? 
BORDEN You are the Great Danton, aren't you? 
Root gestures silence, glancing around them. 
ROOT Of course I am. But don't advertise it- I'll be mobbed with fans. (grins at Borden) And who might you be? 
BORDEN Just a humble admirer. And fellow practitioner. 
ROOT Ah, very good. Root DOWNS the rest of his new pint, placing the empty glass in front of Borden with an emphatic THUNK. 
BORDEN Another? 
ROOT If you insist. I'm not perfoming tonight. Well, only one show, and, to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days. 
BORDEN You could probably do it blindfolded. 
ROOT Bloody good idea. 
BORDEN Have it. 
ROOT Thanks. A new pint arrives. Root sips. 
BORDEN Actually, there's something I might warn you about. 
ROOT Oh? 
BORDEN Well, it's your Transported Man illusion. Now, I'm noit claiming to know your method... but I had a similar trick in my act- and I used... (looks around, 
WHISPERING) ...a double. 
ROOT Oh, I see, very good. 
BORDEN At first. Then it went bad. You se, I hadn't counted on the fact that once I incorporated this bloke into my act, he had complete power over me. 
ROOT Complete power, you say? 
BORDEN 
(NODDING GRAVELY) Weel, he was the secret, you see. And the more successful I became, the more outrageous his demands became. He practically backrupted me. In the end I had to stop performing the illusion completely. (looks at Root) You must be very careful about giving someone that power over you. 
Root looks at Borden. Drunken whells spinning. 
ROOT Thanks for the warning. 
INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING 
Angier is almost all the way through his act. 
ANGIER ...some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...

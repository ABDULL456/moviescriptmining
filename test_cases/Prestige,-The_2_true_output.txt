EXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING 
Angier walks out from the lobby. The two MEN he saw before are loading up their automobile. Smiling, laughing. 
EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING 
The coach pulls to a stop. Angier and the driver look up. 
A plume of SMOKE is rising from further up the hill. 
EXT. CLEARING, PIKE'S PEAK -- MOMENTS LATER 
Angier rounds the bend in the road and comes into view of the laboratory. He FREEZES. 
The fence has been TORN DOWN. Beyond it, the LAB has been BURNED TO THE GROUND. The metal tower is in SMOLDERING PIECES. Everything else is gone. 
Angier notices a piece of metal lying in the road near him, and, using his cane, flips it over. It's Alley's sign warning trespassers to keep out. 
INT. ANGIER'S ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- EVENING 
Angier takes down the picture of Julia from the mantel. He studies it a second then puts it in the top of his packed suitcase. 
INT. LOBBY, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING 
The BELLBOYS wrestle with Angier's cases as Angier walks to the reception desk. The manager smiles up at him. 
MANAGER We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier. 
Angier takes out his wallet and begins laying down bills. 
MANAGER (CONT'D) We are sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave as well. He was very good to Colorado Springs. A very generous man. 
Angier smiles up at him, absently and begins to leave. 
MANAGER (CONT'D) Mr. Angier? 
(ANGIER TURNS) I didn't feel it was necessary to tell the other men about the box. 
Angier stops. 
ANGIER What box? 
The manager smiles. 
INT. HALLWAY, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING 
Angier follows the manager down a darkened hallway. 
MANAGER We never use these rooms in the off - season. It's a shame. 
The manager stops at a set of DOUBLE DOORS and unlocks them. He pushes them open and ushers Angier through. 
INT. BALLROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- CONTINUOUS 
Angier steps into the massive, elegant room. 
Standing on the dance floor is an ENORMOUS SHIPPING CRATE. Stencilled on one side "COLORADO SPRINGS" 
Angier walks up to the huge crate, awestruck. 
An envelope addressed to him has been stuck to the front. Angier stops it and begins to read. 
TESLA (V.O.) My dear Angier, you will find what you were looking for in the box. I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye... 
EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK 
Under cover of night, a group of FIGURES ransack the laboratory. 
TESLA (V.O.) But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado. 
The figure begin setting FIRE to the sides of the laboratory. 
TESLA (V.O.) (CONT'D) The extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry. Perhaps you'll have more luck in your field, mystified. As to the use of the machine... 
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT 
The open crate sits empty at the side of a derelict stage. Angier, in shirt sleeves is running cables to the MACHINE, which is standing center stage. 
TESLA (V.O.) Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions. I add only one suggestion on using the machine- 
EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK 
Alley holds open the door to a coach. Tesla steps up into it and looks back from the coach's open door, up the mountain. 
TESLA (V.O.) -Destroy it. Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean. 
High on the mountain, the laboratory is ABLAZE. 
TESLA (CONT'D) Such thing will only bring you misery. 
Tesla folds himself into the coach, shutting the door as it moes off down the mountain. 
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT 
Angier moves to one side of the stage where he makes a hash mark with a piece of chalk. 
ANGIER (V.O.) Tesla's warning is as unheard as he knew it would be. Today I tested the machine... 
He loads A GUN and places it next to the machine. 
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation... 
Angier THROWS THE SWITCH. The machine GROANS into LIFE- SPARKING and GLOWING as it gets up to full power. 
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...if it went wrong I would not want to live like that for long... 
Angier closes his eyes for an instant, listening to its power, then THROWS HIMSELF INTO THE MACHINE. HE IS CONSUMED BY

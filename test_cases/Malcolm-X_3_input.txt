Music of a dance combo heard in BG. 
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) Three things I was always scared of: a job, a bust and jail. I realized then I wasn't afraid of anything. I didn't care. 
93	OMIT 
94	INT. HARVARD SQUARE APARTMENT - DAY 
Shorty, Sophia and PEG face Malcolm -- stoned in a chair. PEG is 17, Sophia's kid sister and Shorty's date. 
SHORTY You got to eat somethin', Red. 
SOPHIA You want eggs, baby? 
MALCOLM Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby? 
SHORTY I ain't doing bad. 
MALCOLM Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got? 
Peg smiles, afraid of Malcolm. 
SHORTY Jesus, Red, she's just a kid. 
MALCOLM Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this. 
Shorty eyes him with amazement. The degree of Malcolm's depravity surprises even him. 
MALCOLM Surprise you, baby? Well, that's the way it is. What kind of scratch you got on you? Turn out. Let me have it. All of you-- 
Glances exchanged among Shorty, Sophia and Peg. Shorty reaches into his pocket. 
95 	INT. HARVARD SQUARE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Malcolm with Sophia, Shorty and Peg around him. 
MALCOLM We gone rob this town blind. Anybody want out say so. 
Nobody answers; they'll go with Malcolm. 
MALCOLM (contd) Okay. I got the stake and I got a fence. I need a driver. 
PEG How about Rudy? 
MALCOLM Who's Rudy? 
SHORTY Yeah, Rudy. 
JUMP CUT: 
95A 	SAME LOCATION - LATER 
RUDY is with them. He is a good-looking, very-light skinned black, tough as they come. 
RUDY I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one. 
MALCOLM What can you do? 
They are in the process of appraising each other, seeing which one has the bigger penis. 
RUDY You name it, feller. 
SHORTY Rudy does catering. Rich joints on Beacon Hill. 
MALCOLM That ain't bad. 
SHORTY Tell him about Baldy. 
RUDY Yeah. This rich ofay, like he's 60. I give him a bath on Friday. 
Peg and Sophia are listening, a little horrified. 
RUDY (contd) Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off. 
MALCOLM So what about him? 
RUDY So? The man got silver, china, rugs-- 
MALCOLM Might be all right. 
RUDY Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge? 
Malcolm smiles easily. 
MALCOLM You want to be the head man? 
RUDY That's right. 
MALCOLM Head nigger in charge? 
RUDY I'm the man. 
MALCOLM Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this. 
He takes out his gun, a .38 revolver. He dumps the shells on the table, then reinserts one shell and twirls the barrel. 
MALCOLM (contd) I'll flip first. 
He puts the revolver to his own head. 
PEG Don't. 
Malcolm squeezes the trigger. It clicks. Now he twirls the barrel again and hands the gun to Rudy. 
MALCOLM Your flip, baby. 
Rudy is staring at him; so are they all. Malcolm puts the gun to his temple again. 
SOPHIA Red, for God's sake-- 
He pulls the trigger a second time. Click. Now he twirls it again. 
SHORTY Christ, Red, no-- 
PEG I can't stand it.

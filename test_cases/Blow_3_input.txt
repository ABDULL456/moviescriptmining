GEORGE I'll be here. 
George moves over to Mirtha.  It's been a while. 
MIRTHA What do you want? 
GEORGE You knew I was seeing Kristina, right? 
MIRTHA Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school. 
GEORGE Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know? 
MIRTHA I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony. 
GEORGE Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going. 
MIRTHA Yeah?  I better see some money out of it. 
GEORGE Yeah, you will.  Of course. 
Mirtha looks at her ex-husband.  It's not all bad. 
MIRTHA Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her. 
GEORGE Yeah. 
MIRTHA She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas. 
GEORGE I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then. 
He moves down the steps and heads for the sidewalk. 
MIRTHA Hey, George.  You okay? 
GEORGE Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.

INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO APARTMENT - MIAMI - NIGHT 
George is cooking dinner for Kristina.  He's only got a hot plate so it's slow.  The table is set with plasticware. Kristina chops the salad. 
GEORGE I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me? 
KRISTINA Where are you going? 
GEORGE I don't know.  Maybe California. 
KRISTINA You swear? 
GEORGE Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school. 
KRISTINA You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go. 
GEORGE You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags. 
KRISTINA But I've got school. 
GEORGE There's schools in California. 
KRISTINA You swear? 
GEORGE That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date. 
KRISTINA I don't believe you.

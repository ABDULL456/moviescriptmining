CARDENAS Thank you, Doctor McCurdy. (to Dulaney) Your witness. 
Rebecca looks at Dulaney for his opinion of McCurdy's testimony.  Dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he stands up and approaches McCurdy. 
DULANEY Can you say with any certainty that Mr. Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine himself? 
MCCURDY No -- but it seems highly unlikely that a man in his condition would use cocaine. 
DULANEY That's your opinion, Doctor -- but I'm asking you if there is any scientific test that can tell who actually put the cocaine into the Dristan bottle? 
MCCURDY No. 
DULANEY Thank you.

RITA (O.C.) Phil! Rita is calling from across the crowd. She looks at him with disapproval . 
CUT TO: 
INT. PHIL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Phil is making passionate love to a WOMAN in the dark. 
WOMAN 
(MOANS) Oh, Phil. 
PHIL Oh , Rita . The woman suddenly freezes. There is a moment of silence, then she snaps on the light. It's Nancy, not Rita. Phil is as surprised as she is by his slip of the tongue. 
NANCY 
(COLD) Who's Rita? 
PHIL 
(CAUGHT) No one. It's just something I say when I make love. You know -- "Orita", "Orighta"-- it's like "Oh, baby" or something. 
NANCY (not entirely 
CONVINCED) Oh. 
PHIL (corrects her) O-rita. Nancy laughs uncertainly. Phil switches off the light, thinking now about Rita. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING 
Some elderly GUESTS are sipping coffee and eating breakfast, staring uncomfortably at something on the other side of the room. 
THEIR POV Phil is standing at the bookcase, wearing only pajamas, absently munching on a Danish as he reads from one of the books. Mrs. Lancaster approaches him. 
MRS. LANCASTER Isn't it a wonderful collection? 
PHIL (not looking up) Yes, it is. You don't usually find this many trashy novels in one place. 
MRS. LANCASTER You can take a book up to your room if you like. 
PHIL No, thank you. I've actually read them all. I was just rereading some of the dirty parts. He finishes and puts the book back on the shelf. 
MRS. LANCASTER 
(WORRIED) How long will you be staying with us, Mr. Connors? 
PHIL Indefinitely. I've already been here for 211 days. 
MRS. LANCASTER (humoring him) Really? That's quite a long time, isn't it. I hope you're finding things to do in our little town. 
PHIL 
(CASUALLY) Yes, well, I'm getting a little tired of casual sex so today I thought I'd rob a bank and buy myself a really expensive car.

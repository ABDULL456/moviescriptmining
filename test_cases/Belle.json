He hands her a letter and she reads. A beat, as the news resonates through her, silently. Her pained gaze slowly rises to meet LORD MANSFIELD'S. \nDIDO (quiet, shock) I thought I should one day have the opportunity to make his better acquaintance. LORD MANSFIELD Yes.   I know. \n17   INT.

DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 3 18     * \nDarkness. DIDO and ELIZABETH lie in separate beds. Only a shaft of moonlight illuminates their faces. ELIZABETH He must have loved you, Dido. \nDIDO He did not know me. \nELIZABETH My father's new wife wishes him to leave me not a thing, and he obliges her. \nDIDO Then it is her cruelty you should lament, Bette, not his stupidity. ELIZABETH I think he might have loved me more if Mamaa had not died. \nDIDO (pained) I...I think love must be a very complicated thing. \nELIZABETH lifts her head to look across at DIDO.

She is only managing the dictates of the household DIDO Papaa...how...how may I be too high in rank to dine with the servants and too low to dine with my family? \nLORD MANSFIELD Dinner with guests is a formal proceeding, Dido - we simply cannot impose the disregard of those formalities upon visitors. DIDO But...Papaa, am I not..'wealthy', now...an heiress? Surely that changes matters... LORD MANSFIELD (softly) My dear...I wish it were so simple. Finances may go some way - but Society has a habit of disregarding even one of their own, when opportunity provides. DIDO (stung) Of course...(trailing off) LORD MANSFIELD BUT after dinner...when formality is of less consequence...well your presence can raise no defendable objections. (off her sadness) (MORE) \nLORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D) Dido, you know the rules of propriety. Far better than Elizabeth, if I am frank. His loving gaze elicits a smile from her, weary.

ELIZABETH emerges from the house, breathless. \nELIZABETH There you are. I have been searching for you! LADY MANSFIELD (to Dido) What a wretched countenance! \nLADY MARY She deplores my authority. What am I in this household, if not the `observer of rules'?! \nELIZABETH I would rather dine with Dido! \nShe links arms with DIDO in solidarity. \nLADY MANSFIELD What a great pity \nLADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY feign nonchalance. LADY MARY Indeed. \nLADY MANSFIELD Our young gentlemen guests shall miss you, Elizabeth. Both girls' eyes widen - DIDO's with disappointment. \nELIZABETH/DIDO Young gentlemen? LADY MARY Very good connections. \nLADY MANSFIELD And most agreeable by all accounts! ELIZABETH'S mouth falls open. LADY MARY leans toward her. \nLADY MARY Close your mouth and understand: There shall be no discussions tonight in any languages other than English!

OLIVER I do hope my reason for being here will bring you as much happiness as it brings me. DIDO swallows hard. In the CORRIDORS - LADIES MANSFIELD and MARY listen through a crack in the doorway. \nIn the DRAWING ROOM - OLIVER moves closer to DIDO. OLIVER (CONT'D) I think...well, I know...that we make a rather good match. (he pauses) Father has purchased me a commission in the navy - as colonel - Is that not the rank your blood father first purchased? DIDO (anxious) Yes. Indeed it is. \nOLIVER So I feel my career is now set. All that remains... A long beat. OLIVER gathers his courage... \nOLIVER (CONT'D) I can not offer you a title, Miss Lindsay..for the next `Lady Ashford'...well that title must fall to my brother's wife... (huge,nervous breath) What I am trying to say is, I can without doubt, offer you ALL that is due to `Mrs Oliver Ashford' and...and I trust that this would be acceptable to you.

DIDO is sincere. DIDO (CONT'D) Thank you. \nLORD MANSFIELD nods. Tension is relieved. LADY MANSFIELD We are to make many calls today, Elizabeth.

Wait for no man, dear! \nShe picks up her pamphlet. On the back, a headline reads: Student Politics Puts Rise to Pain of Insurers.   ON DIDO as she double takes. ELIZABETH follows DIDO'S gaze.

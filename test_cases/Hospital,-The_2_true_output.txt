DR. SPEZIO (studies the paper) The kid had a collar fracture. We had him in the O.R. We reduced it and we gave him a small cast. 
He strides off. 
MRS. CUSHING (calls after him) But did you give him a sling? You must have taken X-rays. How am I supposed to make up the charges? 
She turns into... 
EMERGENCY AREA, HOLDING ROOM 
Designed to hold patients who've been examined and wait to be admitted to a room upstairs, it's in fact used for examination, treatment, storage. The room is quiet. Two male patients lie on comfortable stretchers, apparently sedated and resting. Mrs. Cushing turns to the patient immediately to her right as she enters. To the still figure she poses her questions. 
MRS. CUSHING Are you Mitgang? 
She gets no answer from that bed. From another direction, a voice. 
MITGANG I'm Mitgang. 
She turns to Mitgang. Something bothers her about the first patient. She finds Mitgang's chart tucked in under his pillow, takes out her pencil. 
MRS. CUSHING Do you carry Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Mr. Mitgang, if you don't mind? 
Mitgang, eyes closed, emits a sound. 
MRS. CUSHING Do you have your card with you? (no answer) Do you know your number? 
Negative grunt from Mitgang. 
MRS. CUSHING Mr. Mitgang, you're not leaving this room until I have this information. 
NURSE (enters for some chore) Will you leave that man alone? 
In a fit of temper, Mrs. Cushing throws the chart and her pencil down on the floor. 
MRS. CUSHING (indicating the other patient) Do you mind if I at least ask this gentleman to fill out his chart? 
She pulls his chart from under his pillow, bends and retrieves her pencil from the floor, straightens. She speaks to the silent patient. 
MRS. CUSHING May I have your A.H.S. policy number, sir? 
No answer. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the patient. We now recognize him as the bespectacled young activist Dr. Ives, so recently coshed over the head with a sandbag. 
MRS. CUSHING (looming) Do you carry Blue Cross? Blue Shield? 
Mrs. Cushing stares at the patient. He is not breathing. Behind her, the nurse exits carrying whatever she came for. Mrs. Cushing turns to her, but she is gone. Frowning, Mrs. Cushing backs out... 
...as Dr. Spezio and others come down the corridor. 
MRS. CUSHING (as Spezio approaches, with spiteful relish) I think one of your patients in here is dead, Dr. Spezio. 
DR. SPEZIO (enters the Holding Room) Why do you say that, Mrs. Cushing? 
MRS. CUSHING Because he wouldn't give me his Blue Cross number, Dr. Spezio. 
HOLDING ROOM 
Spezio regards the death mask of a face. 
DR. SPEZIO Oh, Christ. 
He moves quickly forward to raise the dead man's eyelid. Behind him, a nurse enters. He wheels on her angrily.

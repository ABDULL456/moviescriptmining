REILLY (into mic) We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up! 
Reilly throws done the mic, takes aim again. 
THE U-HAUL 
idles.   Swan's rage erupts.       He climbs out with Mary in tow. 
ALLEY 
Reilly aims carefully... 
Swan keeps his Mac-11 to Mary's head. Reilly is frozen by the move. Swan backs to the rear of the van. He slides up the door, revealing the drums and explosives to the Bomb Squad. He reaches in and grabs a remote control. 
SIRENS are coming closer, only a block or two away... 
AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN 
Glass and T.J. drop their jaws.       They see Swan depress the remote, arming the explosives. 
T.J. Jesus... 
GLASS Reilly!    He's loaded! 
ALLEY 
REILLY (yelling) Glass, you guys take cover, goddammit! 
SWAN I want out, right now.      Or the whole city block is gone. 
GLASS Reilly, he's got enough to do it. 
Reilly leaves the cover of his car and scurries along the side of the alley, escaping Swan's view. 
Swan rages.   He moves around the van, pulling Mary along. 
Swan SPRAYS a FLURRY of bullets over Reilly's head... Reilly dives for cover as bullets rip the alley wall inches from his face. 
Swan whirls and SPRAYS the Bomb Squad Van, dropping T.J. with a shot to the leg. Bev drops to his aid. Glass grimaces, having been hit in the shoulder. 
Reilly moves forward about to take the shot. 
GLASS (cont.) Reilly, don't. He's got a pressure switch. He releases it, we're done for. 
Swan turns back to Reilly, rams his Mac-11 to her throat. 
SWAN Drop it. 
MARY (to Reilly) Take him! 
Mary jerks away from Swan. 
Reilly fast FIRES. 
Swan takes Reilly's SHOTS in the chest. He smiles as he starts to fall, his hand starts to open up to release the detonator... 
Mary dives onto Swan and grabs at the remote, clasping it in her hands. Swan collapses, Mary on top of him. 
Reilly and Glass sprint at the U-Haul, reaching a trembling, bleeding Mary. 
She clinches her jaw, fighting the grief, holding on to the remote. 
Reilly reaches Mary first and puts his hands over her's - she looks up into his eyes--distraught.

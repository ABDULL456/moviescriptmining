They look up.  Ellie standing by their table.  Jeans, down vest.  Hair tousled. 
FRED Nancy Drew!  Pull up a seat! 
FRANCIS You hear what happened, Ellie? 
ELLIE Yeah. 
RICH Pretty cool. 
FARRELL Rich found the gun. 
ELLIE I know.  I heard. 
Fred leans back in his seat.  Eyeballs Ellie. 
FRED Something's on Nancy's mind. 
Ellie reaches into her vest pocket.  Pulls out a Ziploc with the SHELL CASING inside. 
ELLIE I found this out on the beach. 
FARRELL What is it? 
ELLIE Shell casing.  9mm. 
Will, blanches. 
FRANCIS Let it go, Ell.  We got the bad guy. 
ELLIE None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon. And the murder weapon was a 357. 
Rich throws peanut shells at her. 
RICH Get a hobby, will ya? 
Ellie brushes off the shells.  Looks right at Will. 
ELLIE It's a legitimate point, isn't it, Detective Dormer? 
Everyone turns to Will.  Their faces, spinning.  He nods. 
WILL It's legitimate. 
ELLIE Worth pursuing? 
He looks up.  Holds her gaze.  Then turns away.  Grabs the side of the table. 
WILL The case is closed, Ellie. (gets up) I got the next round. 
The guys don't protest.  Will starts heading for the bar. Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs.  Smoke. MUSIC.  Laughter.  Arguing.  A mass of bodies and sound. Like being swallowed up in a black hole... 
Looks back at the table. 
Ellie, watching him. 
EXT. ELLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ellie's truck pulls up in front of a small house.  She jumps out. 
INT. FRONT HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT 
SLAM!  Ellie heads through the front door like a gust of wind.  Thunders up the stairs.  Calls out. 
ELLIE Me, Pop! 
We hear the TV in the other room.  An older MAN, Ellie's father, appears in the doorway.  Thick glasses, grey stubble, big paunch.  Wearing a flannel robe. 
ELLIE'S DAD Ellie?  You okay? 
Ellie appears at the top of the stairs. 
ELLIE Where's all my academy stuff? 
INT. BASEMENT 
Pitch black, then, CLICK! as a bare lightbulb's switched on. Ellie stands beneath it.  Piles of crap everywhere. 
She steps through the quagmire of old bikes, fans, auto parts.  Over to a stack of cardboard BOXES in the corner. 
She nudges through them, reading the writing on the tops.  In thick black pen.  Shoves a couple aside. 
Then.  Finds what she's looking for.  Pulls down a box marked:  Ellie Acad.  Tears it open. 
INSIDE - piles of papers, polaroids of her and her FRIENDS, schedules, syllabi, handbooks.  Stuff from her Academy year. At the bottom, a report.  The title:  "Securing the Crime Scene," the Leland Street Murders.  By Eleanor P. Burr. 
Ellie pulls it out.  Sits down on an old stool.  Opens to the middle of the report.  Her finger, tracing down the typewritten page.  Flips to the next page.  Then the next. The next.  Then.  She spots it. 
THREE-QUARTERS DOWN THE PAGE, her finger finds the sentence:...Detective Dormer's unregistered Smith and Wesson model 39/13 9mm, to immobilize Langley... 
Ellie looks up.  Chews her bottom lip. 
EXT. MARINERS MEMORIAL - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY 
CLOSE ON a huge wave CRASHING against a retaining wall. Spray flying. 
PULL BACK to reveal a small monument by the sea.  A stone cupola with a bronze statue underneath.  The sky, black with clouds. 
INT. MARINER'S MEMORIAL - CONTINUOUS 
Walter Byrd waits under the Mariner's Memorial.  Wind whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him.  Next to a fifteen-foot statue of a SEAMAN, tall, rugged, tough. Holding on to a thick coil of rope. 
Hunches against the wind.  Watches as...

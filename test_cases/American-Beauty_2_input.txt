CONTINUED: 
BRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes Lester, who is unaware of his presence. 
LESTER (CONT'D) It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you! 
Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated. 
BRAD Hey Les. You got a minute? 
Lester turns around, smiling perfunctorily 
LESTER For you, Brad? I've got five. 
INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office. 
BRAD I'm sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here. 
Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated. 
LESTER Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash. Gotta spend money to make money. Right? 
BRAD Exactly. So... 
Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out. 
LESTER (blurts) Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months? 
BRAD (startled) That's unsubstantiated gossip. 
LESTER That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRAD Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired yet. That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who's valuable and-- 
LESTER Who's expendable. 
BRAD It's just business. 
LESTER (angry) I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad. You've been here how long, a whole month? 
BRAD (frank) I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying to level with you. This is your one chance to save your job. 
Lester stares at him, powerless. 
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
A MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next door to the Burnhams'. Movers carry furniture toward the house. 
The Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn drives, Lester is in the passenger seat. 
CAROLYN --there is no decision, you just write the damn thing! 
LESTER You don't think it's weird and kinda fascist? 
CAROLYN Possibly. But you don't want to be unemployed. 
LESTER Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CAROLYN Could you be just a little bit more dramatic, please, huh? 
As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS next door. 
CAROLYN (CONT'D) So we've finally got new neighbors. You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of-- (heavy disdain) --"The Real Estate King," that house would never have sat on the market for six months. 
She heads into the house, followed by Lester. 
LESTER Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore. 
CAROLYN Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property. You know that. How can you call it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it was. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

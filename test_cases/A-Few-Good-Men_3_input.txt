KAFFEE (continuing; pause) I need you. You're better at research than I am and you know how to prepare a witness. 
Jo lets herself in. She's carrying a huge stack of papers under one arm, and a large brown paper bag under the other. But we stay with KAFFEE and Sam a moment longer. 
JO I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first. 
KAFFEE's still looking at SAM. SAM nods his head. 
SAM Did you get any dumplings? 
CUT TO: 
INT. KAFFEE'S APT. - LATER - NIGHT 
The remnants of the Chinese food is spread around. SAM and JO are sitting and taking notes from KAFFEE. As he speaks, he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. He refers to the blackboard. 
KAFFEE This is our defense. Intent: No one can prove there was poison on the raq. Code Red: They're common and accepted in Guantanamo Bay. The Order: (he writes) A) Kendrick gave it. B) They had no choice but to follow it. (beat) That's it. 
SAM What about motive? 
KAFFEE We're a little weak on motive. They had one. 
JO Just because a person has a motive doesn't mean -- 
KAFFEE Relax. We'll deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up. For now we start here -- (pointing to INTENT) I don't know what made Santiago die, I don't want to know. I just want to be able to show it could've been something other than poison. Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis. Let's start prepping for Stone. 
JO As long as we're on the subject of the doctor -- 
KAFFEE Here we go. 
JO Listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't know what killed Santiago, then he meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock he says it was poison? The doctor's covering up the truth. 
KAFFEE Oh, that's a relief. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use the "Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire" defense. We can't prove coercion!! Alright, fitness reports and biographical information. 
SAM Cartons 3 and 4. 
KAFFEE looks at the cartons and the mind-numbing amount of paper. 
KAFFEE No Cliff-Notes on these things?

SERIES OF SCENES 
The scenes cover the three weeks of preparation leading up to the trial, and are interspersed with shots of Kaffee's apartment getting messier, KAFFEE, JO and SAM flipping through documents and reference books, writing on the blackboard, dozzing off... 
We start with 
INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Jo's on the phone, KAFFEE and SAM are going over testimony, with SAM sitting in a mock witness chair. During this, KAFFEE will go to the door, pay the PIZZA Man for the pizza, and return without missing a single beat. 
JO (into phone) Captain Hill, this is Lt. Commander Galloway, I'm an internal affairs officer with the JAG Corps in Washington, D.C. I'm trying to track down a Captain Matthew Andrew Markinson, USMC... 
KAFFEE Doctor, other than the rope marks, was there any other sign of external damage? 
SAM No. 
KAFFEE No scrapes? 
SAM No. 
KAFFEE No cuts? 
JO (into phone) He resigned his commission a week ago Thursday. 
KAFFEE Bruises? Broken bones? 
SAM No. 
JO (into phone) No, please don't put me on hold -- 
KAFFEE Doctor, was there any sign of violence? 
SAM (beat) You mean other than the dead body? 
KAFFEE Fuck!! I walk into that every goddam time! 
SAM Don't ask the last question. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT 
MOS -- JO pulls two thick volumes off a shelf and takes them to the table where SAM and KAFFEE are working. She plops the books down where they join a pile of about two-dozen just like them and we

INT. A COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
The LAWYERS have their books and papers spread out in front of them. 
KAFFEE Lt. Kendrick, the type of disciplinary action, or "training'' as you say -- 
JO Object. 
KAFFEE Please the Court, I maintain that nothing could be more relevant than what the defendants learned by the example of, among others, the witness. 
JO Nice.

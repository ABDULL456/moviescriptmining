GRANMA I tell ya I gotta git out! 
The cop looks startled, puzzled, but Tom shrugs a disclaimer for responsibility in that quarter. 
TOM (mildly) She's kinda ol'-- 
GRANMA (whimpering) I tell ya-- 
COP Okay, okay! 
GRANMA (triumphantly) Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory! 
As Ma helps Granma out the other side, Tom and the cop exchange a glance and snother shrug at the foibles of women and then look studiedly into space. 
The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: superimposed on the marker of U.S. Highway 66 an assortment of roadside signs flashes by: Bar-B-Q, Joe's Eats, Dr. Pepper, Gas, Coca Cola, This Highway is Patrolled, End of 25 Mile Zone, Lucky Strikes, Used Cars, Nutburger, Motel, Drive-Inn, Free Water, We Fix Flats, etc. 
A HAND-PAINTED SIGN reads: "CAMP 50Â¢." It is night. We hear the sound of guitar music. In the CAMP GROUND a small wooden house dominates the scene. There are no facilities; the migrants simply pitch makeshift tents and park their jalopies wherever there is a space. It is after supper and a dozen or more men sit on the steps of the house listening to Connie play a road song on a borrowed guitar. The music softens the tired, drawn faces of the men and drives away some of their shyness. In the dark, outside the circle of light from the gasoline lantern on the porch, some of the women and children sit and enjoy the luxury of this relative gaiety. The proprietor sits tipped back in a straight chair on the porch. 
We see the JOAD TENT. Behind their truck, a tarpaulin is stretched over a rope from tree to tree. Granma lies asleep on a quilt, stirring fitfully. Ma sits on the ground at her head, fanning her with a piece of cardboard. Rosasharn lies flat on her back, hands clasped under her head, looking up at the stars. The music comes to them pleasantly. 
ROSASHARN Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby? 
MA Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy. 
ROSASHARN Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside. 
MA Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow. 
ROSASHARN But will it--hurt the baby? 
MA They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it. 
ROSASHARN You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma? 
MA (thoughtfully) Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n-- (simply) --I'll do it. 
ROSASHARN Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think? 
MA (quickly) No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that. (After a pause) That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together. 
As the music ends we see a GROUP ON THE PORCH STEPS. The men murmur approbation of Connie's playing. 
PA (with quiet pride) Thas my son-in-law. 
FIRST MAN Sings real nice. What state y'all from? 
PA Oklahoma. Had us a farm there, share- croppin'. 
TOM Till the tractors druv us out. 
FIRST MAN We from Arkansas. I had me a store there, kind of general notions store, but when the farms went the store went too. (Sighing) Nice a little as you ever saw. I shore did hate to give it up. 
PA (profoundly) Wal, y'cain't tell. I figure when we git out there an' git work an' maybe git us a piece a growin' lan' near water it might not be so bad at that. 
OTHER MEN Thas right... Payin' good wages, I hear... Ever'body got work out there... Can't be no worse... 
As they talk, a SECOND MAN, standing on the edge of the group, begins to grin bitterly. He is much more ragged than the others. 
SECOND MAN You folks must have a pot a money. 
The GROUP turns to look at the Man. 
PA (with dignity) No, we ain't got no money. But they's plenty of us to work, an' we 're all good men. Get good wages out there an' put it all together an' we'll be awright. 
The Man begins to snigger and then to laugh in a high whinneying giggle which turns into a fit of coughing. All of the men are watching him. 
SECOND MAN Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?

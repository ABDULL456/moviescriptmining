She points over his shoulder to the hammer hanging in plain view. 
INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER 
Bucky kneels on the ground near the closet, toolbox next to him. He pulls on the floorboard, it flexes and squeaks. 
He uses the hammer to pull the board completely off. He squeezes wood glue around the edges and is about to replace the board when something under the floor catches his eye. 
He reaches into the hole, pulling out STACKS OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS BOUND WITH RUBBER BANDS. 
He spies another scrap of paper in the hole... 
INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME 
Kay pours two scotches. 
KAY Dwight? 
She carries the scotches into the bedroom and finds Dwight sitting on the floor, staring at thousands of dollars in cash. 
He holds a paper money band inscribed: "$100...Boulevard- Citizens Bank..." 
KAY (cont'd) Oh. I...always wondered where he kept it. 
THE BOULEVARD-CITIZENS BANK HEIST - A FLASHBACK 
A SHOTGUN BLAST shatters the back window of the armored truck. In the front seat, LEE BLANCHARD ducks down as the driver hits the gas... 
BACK ON THE SCENE 
as Bucky leans back against the bed. 
BUCKY Were you ever going to tell me? 
KAY He'd given all his money to Ben Siegel. (beat) He wanted to give me a home. 
A FLASHBACK - LEE'S CAR 
Lee and Bucky, their first day as partners... 
LEE ...said I'd get a shot at Joe Louis if I'd take two dives for him. I said no... 
BACK ON THE SCENE 
as Bucky looks straight up into the ceiling light... 
BUCKY Were you ever going to tell me? 
KAY He knew what Bobby was doing to me...How he'd used a razor on me...pimped me to his friends... 
INT. DEWITT'S APARTMENT - A FLASHBACK 
as Lee plants the incriminating bank bags in DeWitt's closet... 
BACK ON THE SCENE 
Bucky staring back into the hole in the floor... 
KAY ...Bobby know nothing about the bank job. He and Lee, they never even met. After Lee and his driver got away, Lee figured framing Bobby'd give me a way out... 
EXT. DEWITT'S TRIAL - FLASHBACK 
Lee leads Kay out of the courtroom. 
BACK ON THE SCENE 
as Kay leans down next to Bucky, gently putting her hand on his shoulder... 
KAY Then last year...the fourth man--the driver--he heard Bobby was getting paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt that Lee framed him. He wanted money we didn't have. Ten thousand dollars. 
BUCKY Ever. Were you ever...? 
KAY Promise me this: Forgive him for DeWitt. Forgive him for the bank. It doesn't matter anymore. Not to us. 
BUCKY Who was the driver, Kay? Tell me. Tell me! 
He's in her face now. Okay, pal, you asked for it. 
KAY Baxter Fitch. 
EXT. THE STREET - A FLASHBACK 
Three black man and a white man get rousted by Lee and Bucky. 
BAXTER FITCH Blanchard? 
Chaos erupts as Lee executes Baxter Fitch and Bucky kills two others... 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
on Bucky's anguished face: 
KAY (cont'd) He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him everything else. But don't forgive him for that. Ever. 
She reaches for his face and he pulls away. 
SLO-MO CLOSE-UP... 
as the crumpled money drops down into the hole in the floor, into the blackness... 
WE FADE UP TO: 
INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT 
Bucky, stripped to bare chest, attacks the heavy beg. 
VOICE OVER Fire and Ice. The hero and the snitch. Bank robber and his best friend the bumfuck detective. Triggerman. Stooge. Weak point in a fairy tale triangle. 
He lashes into the heavy bag with a series of brutal left hooks. Kay stands in the door, watching him. Her eyes red from crying. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) I would forgive Lee the bank job. And I thought I'd forgive Kay her role in keeping it from me. But the basic rule of Homicide applied: Nothing stays buried forever. Corpses. Ghosts. Nothing stays buried forever. Nothing. 
Kay turns around and shuts the door behind her. 
EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S GARDEN - DAY 
Bucky and Jane drink iced tea. A glorious garden behind them. 
JANE CHAMBERS So. What brings you around again? Considering a courtin' the old rich widow? 
BUCKY You're not that old. And you're not very widowed. 
JANE CHAMBERS You either are or you aren't. 
BUCKY You seem to be doing all right. 
JANE CHAMBERS Eldridge had cancer. I half expected it. We weren't that close anymore...You married? 
BUCKY Little over a year. 
JANE CHAMBERS God. Newlyweds. Nothing better, is there? 
Bucky's face betrays his difficulties.

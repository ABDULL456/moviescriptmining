EXT./INT. AIRLOCK - DAY 
LEWIS guides MARK towards the airlock with her MMU. 
LEWIS (INTO COMMS) Beck, prep the sick bay. We're bringing him to you. Everyone else, meet me in Airlock Two. 
MARTINEZ, JOHANSSEN, and VOGEL race down from the bridge to meet them. They're not in suits -- they have to wait for the outer airlock to close. THROUGH THE OBSERVATION WINDOWS: they see Lewis and Mark touch down in the airlock. 
The outer airlock closes -- WHOOSH -- Mark collapses, exhausted. The inner airlock opens. Martinez, Johanssen, and Vogel race into the room, grab Mark. Supporting him. Holding him. 
MARK Hi guys. 
Everyone fighting back tears. 
JOHANSSEN Oh, hey Mark. Haven't seen you in a while. 
MARTINEZ Yeah. What've you been up to? 
MARK Oh. You know. Same old, same old. 
Click. They help him with his helmet. As they pull it off, everyone is suddenly taken aback. Oh my god... 
VOGEL You smell horrible. 
MARK I haven't showered in a year and a half. Cut me some slack. 
Johanssen's eyes are watering. Good lord, he smells bad. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHANSSEN You don't know what you're asking us here. 
MARTINEZ Yeah, captain, we may need to put him back. 
MARK I missed you guys. 
They hold each another.

TITLE: DAY 1 
INT. NASA - TEACHING THEATER - DAY 
The young, fresh-faced recruits in NASA's Astronaut Candidate Program are abuzz as Mark enters the room. The students nudge each other -- Look, there he is. 
By the time Mark reaches the lectern at the front, he has the full attention of the class. 
MARK Welcome to the Astronaut Candidate Program. Pay attention. This could save your life. (THEN) Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. 
The class laughs. 
MARK (CONT'D) Okay, let's see if I can get some of your questions out of the way up front. Yes, I did, indeed, survive on a deserted planet by farming in my own shit. It was even more disgusting than it sounds. Let's never speak of it again. 
More laughter. Mark lets it subside. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARK (CONT'D) Question Two: "When you were stranded and alone up there... did you think you were gonna die?" 
And there's a pause as Mark thinks about it. The rare moment of reflection for our hero. 
He nods. Genuine: 
MARK (CONT'D) Yes. 
Then... 
MARK (CONT'D) And it'll happen to you, too. You should know that going in. It's space. It's filled with chance, circumstance, and bad luck. It doesn't cooperate. At some point, I promise, at some point every single thing is gonna go south on you, and you'll think: this is it. This is how I end. (THEN) And you can either accept that... or you can get to work. 
He lets those words land. 
MARK (CONT'D) That's all it is. You simply begin. Solve one problem. Then the next one, then the next. (THEN) You solve enough problems... and you get to come home. 
Mark opens his notebook. 
MARK (CONT'D) All right. Questions? 
Every hand in the class shoots into the air. 
MUSIC UP: "LOVE TRAIN" by The O'Jays carries us to...

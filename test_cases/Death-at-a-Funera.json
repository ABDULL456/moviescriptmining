LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMUSIC CUE: The music fades out. TIGHT SHOT on AARON (CHRIS ROCK) thirties, dressed in a black suit and tie. He looks straight ahead with a somber expression. The camera pulls back to reveal he is watching FOUR UNDERTAKERS (INCLUDING BRIAN) place a coffin on a raised platform. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The living room has been prepared for the funeral service, with several rows of chairs laid out. \nBRIAN Would you like to see... Aaron nods his head \"yes\", as BRIAN begins to open the coffin. Aaron crosses to the coffin. There's a dramatic moment as Aaron moves to the coffin and braces himself for what he's about to see. The coffin opens and Aaron stares long and hard at the body. \nAARON Brian... who is that? \nBRIAN Excuse me? \nAARON Who is this man I'm looking at? 'Cause it's not my father. \nBRIAN Are you sure? \nAARON Are you asking me if I'm sure I know what my father looks like? \nBRIAN People make mistakes in times of grief. \nAARON Man, look at the damn body! Brian peers into the coffin. We see it's an ASIAN MAN. \nBRIAN Oh shit! The other undertakers look embarrassed. \nAARON Come on, Brian. You know what my father looks like. He used to take you to little league. \nBRIAN I'm sorry, man. I got a little nervous. This almost never happens. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nAARON It's happened before?! You mean this is a normal thing?... This isn't Burger King. You can't just mess up my order. \nWe see Norman's car exiting the freeway. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAaron and Michelle are standing to the side as the undertakers place the coffin on the stand. Brian nervously lifts the lid and Aaron looks inside. \nBRIAN \n(RESPECTFUL) So is this your father? \nAARON Come on, man. You know that's my father. \nBRIAN Just trying to be professional. What up, Michelle? \nMICHELLE \n(DRYLY) Brian. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He closes the lid and all four undertakers quietly head off. Aaron looks up and sees his mother, Cynthia, has entered the room. Cynthia is clearly drained and tired. She stares at the coffin. \nAARON Mom, how are you feeling? \nCYNTHIA There were so many things we wanted to do... We were going to go to China. \nAARON China? You don't even like Chinese food. \nCYNTHIA That's not the point. I haven't been feeling good. Who knows how long I'm going to live without him. It happens all the time. One spouse goes and then the next. I mean, it might be different if I had a grandchild to take my mind off of everything. \nMICHELLE Cynthia, I-- They all cross to the coffin. \nAARON (cuts Michelle off) Come on, Mom. You're healthy. You'll be fine. You've got your friends and family... Cynthia, Aaron and Michelle stand around the coffin. \nCYNTHIA Where is Ryan? Have you heard from him? \nAARON He'll be here soon. \nCYNTHIA Just seeing that boy's face makes me feel better. I've missed him so much. My baby. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) She looks down at the coffin. Aaron turns away frustrated. Michelle gently touches the coffin. \nMICHELLE Do you need anything, Cynthia? \nCYNTHIA Yeah, you can get your hand off my husband's coffin. You're leaving smudge marks. Michelle tries to wipe it off with her sleeve. \nEXT. STREET - JEFF'S HOUSE - DAY \nMUSIC: \"PAPER PLANE\" by M.I.A. Elaine and Oscar are walking up the stairs of a typical college apartment building. \nINT. JEFF'S HOUSE - SAME \nThe music is coming from Jeff's speakers. JEFF, dressed for the funeral, sits at his desk. He's holding a pill bottle that says: \"VALIUM.\" \nJEFF Yeah, I found them. The ones in the Valium bottle?... Yeah... I'll get them to you this evening... Can't do this afternoon... It's your fault you left them here... I've got a funeral... My uncle died... Yeah, tragic... No, I haven't taken any. I saw what they did to you... What are they anyway?... The doorbell rings. \nJEFF (CONT'D) I've gotta go, my sister's here... I'll take them with me and stop by after the funeral... Bye. The doorbell rings again. \nJEFF (CONT'D) Hang on! Jeff stands up and we see that he's only half dressed for the funeral. He doesn't have any pants on. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He puts the bottle on the counter then crosses to the door and lets Elaine and Oscar inside. \nJEFF (CONT'D) Hey, what's up? \nELAINE Do you always open the door half naked? Come on, Jeff. We're going to be late. \nJEFF I've just got to put my pants on and I'm ready. Oscar is still a little shaky. \nJEFF (CONT'D) \n(RE: OSCAR) Is he okay? \nELAINE Oscar's freaked out. A guy on a bike ran into the car. \nOSCAR It came out of nowhere. I didn't see him. I'm sorry. \nELAINE It's okay, baby. (then to Jeff) Go put your damn pants on. \nRYAN It's hard to see Dad like this. But he's in a better place now. \nAARON When does dead beat sick? \nRYAN I guess you're right. This is why I try not to get close to people. There's too much emotion involved. \nAARON Well that explains why you never call. \nRYAN What do you want me to say? Some families talk to each other all the time, some just see each other at funerals. That's us. \nAARON I guess it is. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Ryan takes a seat in one of the chairs flanking the coffin. Aaron sits as well. \nAARON (CONT'D) By the way, I'm going to need that money. \nRYAN What money? \nAARON The money for all this... the funeral. You're supposed to pay half. \nRYAN What about the insurance? \nAARON That's Mom's money. \nRYAN What about the pension? \nAARON That's Mom's money. \nRYAN Oh. \nAARON So we're spliting the cost. \nRYAN Are we? \nAARON Yes. We are. \nRYAN Oh, okay. \nAARON So? \nRYAN I don't have it right now. \nAARON What do you mean, you don't have it? You just bought a first class seat for your bag. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRYAN And that's why I don't have any cash. \nINT.. ELAINE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY \nElaine is now driving, Oscar is sitting in the passenger seat looking a little spaced out, with Jeff in the back. Jeff leans forward. \nJEFF So, poor old Uncle Eddie... \nELAINE Yeah. But he was sick for so long. He's much better off now. \nJEFF Dead? Since when does dead beat sick? \nELAINE Shut up, Jeff. Jeff turns his attention to Oscar. \nJEFF I love when you come to family functions, Oscar. Because then Dad focuses all his hate on you. There's no response from Oscar. He looks distantly out the window. The pills are starting to kick in. \nJEFF (CONT'D) Oscar? \nOSCAR Was there a dog in here just now? Elaine looks at Oscar very-strangely. \nELAINE What? He sniffs. \nOSCAR Dalmatian? No, Schnauzer... A beat. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nELAINE What the hell are you talking about? Oscar falls silent and just goes back to looking out the window. \nINT. NORMAN'S CAR - LATER \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Jeff's face reveals his realization of what's happened. He walks off, leaving Elaine watching Oscar. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY \nNorman's car is almost at the corner still being forced backwards by the flower van. We see that Derek is still lost in his own thoughts. Uncle Russell is poking at Norman with his cane. \nUNCLE RUSSELL You're going the wrong way! \nNORMAN Ow! That hurts. \nDEREK Stop the car, Norman. \nNORMAN What? \nDEREK Stop the car. I have to speak with her. I have to speak with Elaine. Norman reluctantly stops the car. Derek gets out. \nNORMAN What about Uncle Russell? I need help with Uncle Russell! It's too late. Derek is gone. The van in front of Norman honks the horn. \nUNCLE RUSSELL What's going on here? Where are we?! We're going to be late! Russell hits him on the arm with his cane. \nNORMAN Ow! Can you please stop doing that?! The van keeps beeping. Norman backs up. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nRyan is standing with Aaron. They greet the mourners. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRYAN \n(TO MOURNER) Nice to see you again. The mourner shakes hands with Ryan then walks away. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Who are all these people? I don't even recognize half of them. \nAARON It's your family. You don't recognize them from the last funeral? Ryan looks around the room. \nRYAN So what side of the family is he on? \nAARON Who? \nRYAN The guy in the leather jacket. Ryan looks around the room and sees a FOUR FOOT SIX MAN (FRANK) approaching the coffin. \nAARON I have no idea. Maybe a friend of Dad's from work or something. Aaron turns to Ryan. \nAARON (CONT'D) So, you're telling me I'm going to have to pay for the whole funeral? \nRYAN No I'm telling you you'll have the money in a few months when I get my advance. \nAARON I'm not a God damn credit agency! REVEREND DAVIS, a very calm, serene woman, suddenly appears. \nREVEREND DAVIS Aaron, how are you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nAARON Yes, um... We're just waiting for everyone to arrive, then we can get going. I know you're in a hurry. \nREVEREND DAVIS Yes, I have two more funerals and a Christening. I don't know what it is about the Spring, but they're either coming in or going out. She laughs, but Aaron and Ryan just look at her. Reverend Davis stands there waiting to be introduced to Ryan. \nAARON Have you met my brother, Ryan? \nREVEREND DAVIS Ah, the writer, of course. I must admit I squeezed this job in because I wanted to meet you. I'm reading \"Mama's Secret\" right now. Don't tell anybody, I'm not supposed to be reading that kind of stuff. \nRYAN I'm sure the Lord will forgive you. Aaron is irritated. \nREVEREND DAVIS \n(TO AARON) You must be very proud of your big brother. He really made something of his life. \n(TO RYAN) I can't wait to hear your eulogy. \nAARON No, no, I'm doing the eulogy. \nREVEREND DAVIS Oh. I thought... \nRYAN Aaron is the oldest. The reverend tries her best not to look disappointed. \nUNCLE RUSSELL What are you doing?! Be careful with that. Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently. \nUNCLE RUSSELL (CONT'D) Hurry up, we're late. Norman slams the trunk closed. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAaron tries to get across the room as Michelle heads into the kitchen. Ryan stops Aaron. \nAARON Oh, Ryan can you keep an eye out-- \nRYAN God damn, that Martina has grown up. ANGLE ON: MARTINA, nineteen and attractive. \nAARON Are you talking about Little Martina? \nRYAN She was like a teenager when I left, and now she's... you know. She's like damn. Aaron looks distastefully at his brother. \nAARON Can you keep an eye out for Uncle Russell? \nRYAN I think I should go see how she's been. \nAARON Yeah, why don't you do that? See if she wants a juice box. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Ryan heads off towards Martina. Aaron continues across the room. \nFRANK (O.S.) Hi there. Aaron turns and finds himself cornered by Frank. \nAARON Hello. \nFRANK I was really sorry to hear about your dad. He talked about you a lot. I saw your wedding pictures. Your wife's dress was very beautiful. Aaron is a little uncomfortable. \nAARON Uh... thanks. \nMAN Did he ever mention me?... Frank? Frank steps forward and holds out his hand. Aaron shakes it. \nAARON Frank?... I don't think so, no... Were you a friend of his? \nFRANK Something like that, yeah. Michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen. \nMICHELLE Honey. Can I see you for a moment? \nAARON Well, nice to meet you. Thanks for coming. Aaron walks away, leaving Frank alone. \nEXT. STREET - SAME TIME \nWIDE SHOT: Norman struggles to push Uncle Russell up a hill. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nUNCLE RUSSELL Come on, put your back into it. You're supposed to be a young man. Don't you have any strength? \nINT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nAaron has almost made it across the room when he is intercepted by Reverend Davis. \nREVEREND DAVIS I think we should get started. really have to leave at three. \nAARON Sure. Can we just wait five minutes for my Uncle Russell? We can't start without him. \nREVEREND DAVIS .Of course. \nEXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY \nElaine and Jeff are talking to some mourners. \nELAINE It's so nice to see you. \nWOMAN I'm so sorry to hear about your uncle. But he's in a better place now. I hear Ryan is doing the eulogy. Oscar, carrying a leaf, interrupts the conversation. \nOSCAR Look... Isn't it beautiful? He wanders off again. Elaine doesn't know what the hell is going on. \nJEFF Elaine, can I speak to you for a minute? \nELAINE (to the mourner) I'll see you inside. Jeff takes Elaine's arm with some urgency and moves off to the side. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDUNCAN How's Pepperdine treating you? Is Professor Clarke still giving you a hard time? \nJEFF No, no. It's all worked out. Don't worry. \nDUNCAN I'm not worried about you. Duncan looks pointedly at Elaine, irritating her. Duncan looks at Oscar who is in the background. \nDUNCAN (CONT'D) So I see you brought your friend. \nELAINE He's my boyfriend. And you know his name. Derek approaches. \nDEREK Doctor, how nice to see you again. \nDUNCAN Derek. How are you doing at the hospital? \nDEREK Great. Great. We should have lunch soon. I'd love to hear what you think about the new pediatric wing at Cedar's. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDUNCAN Definitely. Maybe Elaine would like to join us for lunch? They both look expectantly at Elaine who looks away disgusted. Cynthia comes up to them and kisses Elaine and Jeff hello. Oscar stares at her. \nCYNTHIA Elaine... Jeff... good to see you. \nELAINE I'm so sorry, Auntie. We're going to miss Uncle Edward so much. \nJEFF Yeah. He was a great guy. \nCYNTHIA Thank you. \nELAINE Oscar, this is my Aunt-- Oscar grabs Cynthia in a tight hug. \nOSCAR I'm so sorry about... the death... He sings \"Amazing Grace\" softly as Duncan, Derek, Jeff and Elaine look on. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) Amazing Grace / How sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me... Cynthia untangles herself from Oscar. She heads back outside. Duncan gives Elaine a look, then heads off after Cynthia. \nJEFF What are you going to do? \nELAINE I don't know. I can't leave. Aunt Cynthia would never speak to me again. Jeff notices that Oscar has left. He rushes outside. Elaine follows. Derek follows suit. \nEXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY \nWe see Oscar emerging from the front doorway followed by Jeff. Then comes Elaine. Jeff approaches Oscar and stands with him as Elaine watches from the doorway. Derek walks up. \nDEREK You look nice, Elaine. \nELAINE I'm dressed for a funeral. \nDEREK Yeah, but you make death look sexy. She looks at him. \nDEREK (CONT'D) So, I heard about the engagement. \nELAINE Hey, hey. I don't really have time to deal with whatever happened between you and me. But I have not told my dad yet, so I would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut. \nDEREK Sure. Anything for you. Derek looks over and notices Oscar looking bewildered. \nDEREK (CONT'D) So that's him? That's the man you're going to spend the rest of your life with? Elaine looks over at the drugged up Oscar. Oscar leans over like he's on a nod. Jeff leans down with him, watching. Right before Oscar falls over, he comes up really fast.- Then he starts walking. \nELAINE Yep, that's him. Oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his face, changes direction and flies by Elaine and Derek back into the house with Jeff in tow. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDEREK Elaine., I- Elaine follows the guys, leaving Derek behind. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME \nAaron is straightening his tie and practicing his eulogy. \nAARON My father was an exceptional man... My father was-- Frank again approaches Aaron. \nFRANK Actually, there's something I'd like to talk to you about... when you have a minute. Aaron hears Uncle Russell in the background. \nAARON Yeah, that's great. Do you mind if we do it later though? My uncle just got here. \nFRANK Sure. Aaron heads off. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - SAME TIME \nNorman pushes Russell up the stairs close to where Derek is standing. He looks like he's about to collapse from exhaustion. Norman lets go of the wheelchair and catches his breath. Derek grabs the chair blocking Norman from view just as Aaron arrives. \nAARON Good afternoon, everyone. (his voice cracks) Thank you for coming... I never realized Dad was so popular. It looks like he's got more friends now that he's dead. Blank faces stare back at Aaron. Cynthia looks pained. Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly. Elaine silences him with a look. Aaron composes himself and pulls his notes out. \nAARON (CONT'D) My father was an exceptional man... He was born in 1938. He grew up in Alabama on a farm. He loved to take long walks in the woods with his close friend, Bobby. He told me how they spent their summer days riding their bikes through the fields and swimming in the lake. As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like \"what can I do?\" Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted with pain. He looks like he's going to burst. ANGLE ON: Aaron. \nAARON (CONT'D) Dad's first job was working after school as an assistant to an electrician named Mr. Thompson. Back then, Blacks weren't allowed to wear rubber gloves. So my father got shocked a lot. Because of that, he had no feeling in his fingertips. I asked my Dad what his first boss was like... The drugs have gotten the best of Oscar. He suddenly grabs Elaine's arm. Aaron keeps talking. \nOSCAR Did you just see that? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nELAINE See what? \nOSCAR The coffin just moved. \nELAINE What? \nOSCAR I'm telling you I saw it move. Aaron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance, but battles on with his eulogy. \nAARON .He said he was a nice man, and surprisingly well dressed. When Dad was eighteen, he left home after an argument with his father. He never told me what that argument was about, but I do know that after leaving South Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch and never saw each other again. Dad went to college where he studied accounting, a decision which lead to a career in corporate finance... But his real passion was for the arts, with a particular fondness for theatre, dance and musicals. He was a charter member of the Negro Ensemble Company and contributed regularly to the Alvin Ailey School of Dance. Oscar's protests are getting louder. Duncan looks back at the disruption with a disapproving glare. Elaine looks at Jeff who watches, concerned. \nOSCAR There, look. It happened again. \nELAINE Oscar, please- People start looking at Oscar, who's becoming increasingly vocal, and looking increasingly like someone on acid. \nOSCAR That coffin's moving! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (5) \nELAINE \n(WHISPERS) Oscar. Just calm down. Aaron looks over to Oscar. \nOSCAR \n(SHOUTS) The coffin's moving! Michelle looks worried. Cynthia watches silently. Oscar jumps up. Aaron stops the eulogy. Elaine is about to die from embarrassment. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) There's someone alive in there! \nELAINE Oscar, please sit down. Oscar ignores her and walks purposefully towards the coffin. People watch him in astonishment, including Jeff. \nOSCAR What the hell is wrong with you people?! Oscar approaches the coffin as Aaron steps off the dais. Elaine tries to hold Oscar back, but she can't. \nELAINE \n(PANICKED) Oscar, where are you going? \nAARON What are you doing? \nOSCAR There's someone moving in there. Can't you see? Oscar tries to open the coffin. Aaron and Elaine try to restrain him, but can't. A tussle begins. Ryan jumps in to help. \nRYAN What the hell is wrong with you?! \nELAINE Ryan, no! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (6) Elaine attempts to grab Ryan. Duncan stands up and tries to help. \nDUNCAN Get away from there! \nOSCAR No, I have to show you! He's alive! He's alive! The scene descends into absolute chaos with people pushing and struggling. Finally, the coffin falls off the platform and tips over. The dead body of Edward rolls out onto the floor at the feet of Cynthia. Cynthia screams. Aaron freezes in shock. Michelle takes Cynthia through the kitchen. The living room is left in chaos. \nEXT. BACK GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER \nElaine drags Oscar out the back. Jeff follows. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nCynthia, in tears, enters accompanied by Aaron, Michelle and Reverend Davis. \nMICHELLE It's alright, Cynthia. It's alright. She sits in a chair crying uncontrollably. Aaron is so angry, he just marches out. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSome MEN grab the body and put it back in the coffin. Aaron comes out of the kitchen and heads to the back yard. As they put the coffin back on the stand, Ryan addresses the crowd. \nRYAN Please let me extend my apologies to you all. I understand the incident you just witnessed was quite shocking, but everything will be... returned... to it's proper place. Please enjoy the refreshments, and we'll call you when we're ready to continue. \nELAINE Come and sit down. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAaron talks to a mourner. Norman comes up and hugs him. \nNORMAN Are you alright?... That was insane. He just fell out the coffin like a dead fish. I guess its not much of a metaphor when you're talking about a dead human, but-- \n(CONTINUED) \nDeath at a Funeral 02/6/0.9 49. \nCONTINUED: Aaron looks at Norman. \nAARON Norman, please. \nNORMAN Oh yeah... Sorry. It's just that you never know when it's your time. Like, I have this weird thing on my wrist. I've had it for a few weeks now. I don't know what it is-- \nAARON Why don't you show it to my Uncle Duncan? He's a doctor. \nNORMAN He is? Great. Thanks. Norman walks off toward the kitchen. He passes Uncle Russell and Ryan talking to Martina. \nUNCLE RUSSELL I read your last book, \"Black Hurt.\" \nRYAN Good, good. Thanks a lot. \nUNCLE RUSSELL I'm not giving you a compliment you arrogant bastard. What a load of bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with it. Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell. \nEXT. BACK GARDEN - SITTING AREA - DAY \nOscar, Elaine and Jeff are standing together. \nOSCAR I swear it was moving. I must be losing my mind... (looks at his hands) Why are my hands so big?! \nELAINE Oscar, listen to me. I need to tell you something... Elaine sits him down on the bench. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOSCAR What is it? \nELAINE Now... You remember I gave you some Valium earlier? \nOSCAR Yes. \nELAINE Well it turns out that it wasn't actually Valium. Oscar just looks at Elaine. Jeff slinks off into the background. \nELAINE (CONT'D) Can you hear me? \nOSCAR \n(YELLS) Hello? \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nCynthia is being comforted by her friends and Duncan. Norman enters and beckons Duncan over to the side. \nNORMAN Hello, Doctor, I know this is a bad time, but I've got this thing on my hand. I've had it for weeks now... Duncan is looking at Norman incredulously. \nNORMAN (CONT'D) What do you think it is? Cynthia stands up. \nCYNTHIA Duncan, I'm going back now. She exits. Reluctantly, Duncan answers Norman. \nDUNCAN You should probably go see a dermatologist. He turns to follow his sister out, but Norman pulls him back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNORMAN Really? Why? What do you think it is? \nDUNCAN I don't know. It looks like some kind of pigment mutation. Duncan walks further out of the room. \nNORMAN Pigment mutation?! Duncan turns again. \nDUNCAN You're probably just allergic to something. Maybe from shellfish, nuts... Duncan heads further out of the room, but Norman won't give up. \nNORMAN Nuts? What kind of nuts? Duncan turns around again. \nDUNCAN I don't know. Pecans? Peanuts?... Excuse me. Duncan finally exits, leaving Norman looking shocked and terrified. \nOscar is talking to himself in the mirror. \nOSCAR Okay. Breathe. \n(HE DOES) It's going to be okay. Breathe. You're and investment banker. You've handled mergers for billion dollar companies. You can do this. Dead bodies don't move. They don't move. But that body was moving. It was moving. Then he slaps himself. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) Snap out of it! You can handle this. You can do this. He runs the tap and splashes some water on his face. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) Alright. You're okay. Stay calm... Stay calm... Oscar is still staring at himself in the mirror. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) That's it, Oscar, keep it together. K.I.T. Keep it together. K.I.T. Keep it together. Everything's going to be fine. Nothing moved. Dead people don't move. They're stiff. They don't move, do they? \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOSCAR (CONT'D) (he screams at himself in the \nMIRROR) \nDO THEY!!!! \nINT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR \nElaine has her ear pressed against the door. She hears the scream. \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME \nOSCAR Easy now. Easy now. We can do this. A few hours. That's nothing. No sweat. I mean you've already been in here for... He looks at his watch. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) Where's my watch?! He sees it's on the other wrist. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) Oh! He checks the time. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) It's already been... \nINT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - SAME TIME \nElaine continues to knock on the door. \nELAINE Open the door. Oscar. \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME \nOscar finally gets a read on his watch. \nOSCAR Five minutes. Suddenly the pressure of. the situation overtakes him. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) God damn! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS'- SAME TIME \nAs the screaming and cursing goes on upstairs, Aaron approaches a mourner who looks concerned. \nOSCAR (O.S.) Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! \nAARON It's alright. Aaron turns around not knowing what to do. \nFRANK (O.S.) Grief does strange things to people. Aaron looks at him a little freaked out by his sudden appearance. \nAARON I guess so. \nFRANK If you remember, I have something to talk to you about. \nAARON Oh yeah. \nFRANK Is there somewhere private we could go? \nAARON Sure. They walk away. The screaming continues as Jeff, frantically, but slowly comes down the stairs re-tracing his steps and searching around for his lost bottle of pills. \nINT. STUDY - DAY \nFrank and Aaron enter. Frank looks around the room a little grief stricken himself. Aaron walks to the desk as Frank touches some mementoes he clearly remembers. Frank takes out his glasses and notices a manuscript on the desk with Aaron's name. \nFRANK Are you writing a novel? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFRANK (CONT'D) I'll tell you how it makes me feel cheap. Like some cheap piece of ass... I mean, I'm entitled to something. \nAARON What do you want? \nFRANK What I want is a lot, but I'm not asking you for what I want. I deserve thirty thousand dollars. \nAARON Thirty thousand dollars?! I can't just give you thirty thousand dollars. My wife and I are trying to have kids-- \nFRANK Your father told me you were having trouble... \n(BEAT) Look, your father promised to take care of me, and I made sacrifices to keep him happy. Aaron gets angry. \nAARON You think you can come in here, slander my father's name and show me a few photos of you and my dad dressed up going to see \"Dreamgirls\"? I saw \"Dreamgirls\" twice. I'm not gay. That's not proof of anything... \"Steppin' to the bad side / Gonna take a mean ride.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) Aaron grabs Frank and pushes him against the wall. \nAARON (CONT'D) I'm not giving you anything but a-- Frank pulls out another photo and holds it up to Aaron's face. Aaron,releases Frank and snatches the picture. \nFRANK Now I don't want to, but I will show these photos to your mother... Do you really want me to do that today? \nAARON Wait here. He exits the study. \nINT. ENTRY CORRIDOR - DAY \nAaron closes the study door behind him and almost bumps into two male mourners. \nMIDDLE AGED MAN Aaron, I was just telling George here how when we were boys together your dad used to love to make us all go skinny dipping. Aaron just stares at them. Then he moves toward the living room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - BUFFET - DAY \nAaron crosses the living room which is full of people mingling around. He's gone pale. \nAARON \n(TO HIMSELF) Oh God, oh God, oh God... He's looking around for Ryan, but there's no sign-. -Michelle watches Aaron walk around the room. \nINT.

LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAaron and Ryan have swiveled the body around so that Frank is facing upwards. \nRYAN Why do you say I don't take anything seriously? You complain about me all the time, but if I didn't play the bad boy, you couldn't play the martyr. \n(MOCKING) Aaron's so great, Aaron's so right, Aaron's so responsible. (back to normal) Why don't you try laughing and enjoying life once in a while? It might make you a better a writer. \nINT. ENTRY CORRIDOR - DAY \nNorman is still talking to Reverend Davis. She looks like she really doesn't want to be there. \nREVEREND DAVIS Look, I must get to a phone. There's a man on the roof who's going to jump. \nNORMAN I'm addicted to strip clubs.

Derek looks at Norman who's looking sort of distant. \nDEREK (CONT'D) How's your skin thing? \nNORMAN Oh that... It's probably nothing.

I was drunk off my ass. You could have been a donkey. \nDEREK Thanks. \nELAINE That wasn't a compliment. I'm saying I couldn't remember it. \nDEREK Well I remember every minute of it. \nELAINE A minute, huh? That's why I don't remember. \nDEREK What is it about this guy? What has he got that I haven't got? \nELAINE Okay, well for one thing, he's responsible. He's caring. He's considerate. He's thoughtful. He's stable. He's-- \nEXT. ROOF - DAY \nOscar is leaning over the ledge playing with his spit and laughing uncontrollably. \nINT. GARAGE DAY \nAaron and Ryan are still arguing. \nAARON I'm not the one who tied him up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRYAN Well somebody had to look out for Mom. \nAARON \n(INCENSED) I've been looking out for Mom since you got your book deal. \nRYAN You just can't get over it, can you? You're burning with jealousy because I left and did what you always wanted to do. \nAARON I couldn't leave because I had responsibilities. \nRYAN Don't put it off on responsibilities. You spent three years on a novel and you won't even let anyone see it! What are you going to do? Wait until you're dead? You think you're going to be the Tupac of books? \nAARON At least I'm not some hack writing crap. Mr. \"Mama's Secret\", Mr. \"Black Hurt.\" \nRYAN Mr. \"Out of Ink\", Mr. \"Blank Page.\" At least my crap gets published. Michelle enters. \nMICHELLE Aaron, what is going on? \nAARON Michelle, please, not now. \nMICHELLE Why are you acting like this? Fine. We don't have to have sex today, but the condo? Don't you want to get out of here? \nAARON \nMICHELLE-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRYAN Just tell her, Aaron. \nMICHELLE Tell me what? Aaron closes the garage door. \nAARON Listen...

He leans against the door, dripping with sweat. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAaron and Ryan look over and see Norman. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ANGLE ON: Norman as he pastes a maniacal grin on his face and crosses into the living room. As he moves through the throng of mourners, they are all unnerved by him. \nNORMAN Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Pardon me. Hi. The hugesmile never leaves his face. ANGLE ON: Ryan, Aaron and Michelle watching Norman, concerned. Norman approaches and stands on the other side of the coffin. \nAARON Norman, why are you grinning like that? \nNORMAN (to Aaron and Ryan) Can you come to the study for a second? Aaron can see from Norman's face, and the sweat on his forehead, that something serious has happened. Then he sees Cynthia sitting in the corner. \nAARON \n(TO MICHELLE) I'll be back soon. Can you check on Mom? \nMICHELLE Sure. They exit. Michelle crosses to Cynthia. \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) Hey, are you doing okay? It's going to be alright. \nCYNTHIA If you've never given life, child, how can you understand death? \nINT. STUDY - DAY \nJeff is leaning on the window. There's a knock at the door. \nAARON (O.S.) It's Aaron. Jeff opens the door. Norman, Ryan and Aaron enter. Norman locks the door behind them. Aaron rushes over to the body. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAARON (CONT'D) Oh shit! Call an ambulance. \nJEFF There's no point. \nAARON What do you mean \"there's no point\"?! \nJEFF Look at him! He's dead! \nAARON Dead, dead? \nRYAN Is there a \"kind of\" dead, Aaron? \nAARON What the hell did you do to him? \nNORMAN We didn't do anything! \nAARON Well he was alive when I left. \nJEFF He hit his head on the table. \nAARON Oh no. This is really bad. This is really, really bad. \nJEFF What are we going to do? \nAARON Twenty-five to life. Norman looks at his watch. \nNORMAN You know what, I really have to be \nSOMEPLACE ELSE-- Norman makes his way to the door. \nJEFF You're not going anywhere. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nNORMAN Look, I'm not the prison type. They'll kill me. Oh my God, I'm going to die. I'm going to die in prison. Oh my God, do you know how fast a rash spreads in prison? Aaron smacks Norman. \nAARON Pull yourself together! Norman calms down. \nNORMAN Thanks, man. After a beat, Ryan speaks. \nRYAN Look, no one here knows who this guy is. Nobody knows his name. They probably didn't even notice him. \n", "test3_true": "RYAN Look, all we have to do is get rid of the body. It'll be like he came and left. \nAARON Get rid of the body?! It took me two months to get rid of a couch. \nJEFF Did any of you happen to notice the size of Uncle Edward's coffin? Everyone looks at Jeff. \nAARON \n(TO JEFF) You want to bury him with my father? \nJEFF Why not?... I mean it's not like he's going to know. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nAARON That's not the point. \nRYAN You have to admit, it makes sense, Aaron. The coffin's there, the hole in the ground's there... He'll be gone, finished, end of story... Unless you have a better suggestion. Aaron desperately tries to think of an alternative. \nINT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY \nDerek and Elaine are sitting in the corridor. Elaine looks drained of energy. Derek's smoking a cigarette. \nDEREK It's funny. No matter what you say, I'm convinced we'll be together. \nELAINE Yeah, well, we all make mistakes... I used to be convinced I was going to marry Prince. What happened there? \nDEREK You still could. \nELAINE You're an idiot. \nDEREK I'm serious. You only live once. You might as well do whatever it is that makes you happy. \nELAINE Yes, but maybe I don't think of life anymore as all about me, me, me. Maybe I've discovered there's something outside of myself that I care about. And maybe you should, too. Derek looks hurt. \nDEREK That's kind of cold. I care about you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nELAINE No, Derek, you care about you. You only care about me in relation to how I affect you. There's a difference. \nDEREK That's not true, Elaine. \nEXT. ROOF - SAME TIME \nOscar is squatting down rolling his head around when he hears Elaine's voice. \nELAINE (O.S.) Derek, get over yourself. \nINT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nElaine moves over to the window. Derek follows her. \nDEREK Hey! He slaps her on the butt. Elaine whirls around. Derek grabs her on the arms. \nDEREK (CONT'D) I'm the man for you, and you're coming home with me. He kisses her. \nEXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS \nOscar turns to look at the window and sees Derek and Elaine kissing. \nINT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - LATER \nElaine pulls away and punches Derek in the face. He staggers back and sees Oscar in the window. \nDEREK What is that?! Elaine turns around. \nELAINE Oscar! \nEXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS \nOscar moves away from the window and further out on the ledge. Elaine opens the window and sticks her head out. \nELAINE Oscar! What are you doing? Get back here and put your clothes on right now! \nOSCAR I saw you kissing him. \nELAINE I wasn't kissing him. I swear. Please, baby, put your clothes on. We're at a funeral! Derek sticks his head out the window behind Elaine. \n"}

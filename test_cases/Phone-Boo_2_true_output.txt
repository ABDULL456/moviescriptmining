STU (into phone) They're ordering me to come out. 
VOICE I can see that.  Ignore them. 
STU What if they open fire? 
VOICE They probably won't.  Look across on the east side of the street.  Do you see the tourist with the home video camera? 
STU'S POV 
A distant crowd gathering on the opposite west side corner behind the police cars.  Some tourist is capturing the event on video. 
BACK TO STU 
STU What about him? 
VOICE He's going to keep the police on their best behavior.  So long as you don't take what could be interpreted as hostile action, you'll be safe. 
STU You call this safe?  Six cops with guns pointed my way? 
VOICE You want me to reduce them to three -- or two? 
STU Absolutely no more shooting.  Now is that clear? 
VOICE You can always change your mind. 
SERGEANT (with bullhorn) You know the drill.  Hands clasped behind the back of your neck -- moving slowly -- step out of the booth.  If we see any sign of a weapon, we will respond. 
STU (shouts) You won't, because there isn't any. 
SERGEANT (bullhorn) I repeat.  Raise your hands. 
STU I can't.  I'm on a phone call. 
Now a black POLICE CAPTAIN arrives and takes full command of the situation. 
CAPTAIN RAMEY You have thirty seconds to comply. 
STU I told you.  I'm busy.  Come back later. 
VOICE Very good, Stu. 
The cops take cover behind parked cars, keeping Stu clearly in their sights.  He has no place to hide.  He's in the battered phone booth in plain view from all sides. 
RAMEY You've been given an order. 
The Sergeant slides up beside the Captain to confer. 
PRODUCTION NOTE: We remain in LONG SHOT of the cops -- always from Stu's POV.  But we can hear their voices and all that is said as if they were in close up.  It has an odd, unreal and distancing effect. 
SERGEANT We're dealing with a mental case. He's looking for us to kill him. 
RAMEY Well he's not getting his wish. 
In the center of the street, an ambulance pulls up and a team of medics jump out.  They rush to Leon's body.  (Again we hear their voices close, even though visually they are far off.) 
FELICIA Tell me he's gonna be alright. 
MEDIC Step aside.  Let us look at him. 
The medics push her aside -- then examine the victim.  He's DOA.

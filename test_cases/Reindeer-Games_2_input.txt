And the world goes dark. 
INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT 
Darkness and shadows. Rudy sits in a corner, holding his head. The cell block silent for the first time. 
Bootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with distinct pleasure. 
RUDY The man had two days... 
MEAN GUARD Well. Least he won't be coming back. 
The guard grins a gold tooth. Rudy looks at him -- 
-- and then springs to his feet, charges the room, grabbing through the bars. The guard takes a calm step back. Keeps the cruel smile. 
MEAN GUARD You need company tonight, Rudy... you just give a holler. 
He puckers a kiss and walks on. Starts whistling "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" Several shadowed VOICES request that he shut the fuck up. The bootsteps and melody drift down the row. 
RUDY 
turns back, starts toward his bunk. And stops. His eyes on Nick's empty bed. And the wall behind. 
THE PICTURES OF ASHLEY 
Smiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn on the photos. All colors of stationery taped to the wall. 
RUDY 
takes a seat on Nick's bed. There's a shoebox at the foot of it. 
Rudy opens it. It's filled with Ashley's letters. 
He trails a finger along them, must be over a hundred pages. He selects the one nearest the front. Surveys it. 
NICK (V.O.) Rudy, man, here we go, here, what she wrote here: "The car's waiting. The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting. I've waited for so long. I'm burning for you, Nick. My whole body. My whole heart. I'm burning for you..." 
Rudy turns to the wall. To the lakeside picture of Ashley, a swimsuit siren. Rudy stares sadly. 
RUDY He was burning for you too... 
And puts the letter away. 
CLOSE ON RUDY'S CALENDAR - NIGHT 
As his hand slashes through December 21st. Prison's over. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN PRISON - DAY 
Snow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS, make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered in snow. 
EXIT GUARD Your world and welcome to it, dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now! We'll keep the lights on for ya! 
Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in summer. 
Secondhand shoes. No possessions. 
He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the fenceway. 
BEYOND THE GATE 
There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them. 
The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free. 
The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade slaps on backs. Reunion time. 
The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he can't help himself -- he glances up -- 
TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN 
bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners. 
RUDY 
drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus. 
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 
Rudy shakes his arms, basking in the vehicle's warmth. Takes a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. Then the cons with relatives start to pile in. 
Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it. 
He rubs his window with his sleeve. 
Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing onto the bus with their loved ones. 
The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming. 
Rudy watches her sadly. 
Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's changed. 
The woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball. 
Rudy looks at the bikini picture again. 
Then at the shivering bundle.

RIPLEY Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back? 
DICKIE What? 
RIPLEY I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you 
INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK. 
A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug. Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's scheming. 
DICKIE I'm never going back. To actually hire somebody to come all the way here to drag me back home - got to be insane, hasn't he? 
SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other. Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on. 
DICKIE (cont'd) I'm never going back! 
RIPLEY No, I think your mother, her illness - 
DICKIE It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for - ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! - it's got nothing to do with my mother. 
RIPLEY I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I - 
DICKIE (interrupting) Go back!  Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard. 
EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON. 
Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom talking with Dickie. 
MARGE Hi Tom. 
DICKIE (looks up) Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye. 
MARGE I'll come down. 
DICKIE (to Ripley) Did you speak to my father? 
RIPLEY You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem. 
MARGE (coming out of the front door) Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans? 
RIPLEY Back, I suppose, slowly as I can. 
He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps. 
RIPLEY (cont'd) Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's - 
Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles. 
DICKIE You like jazz! 
RIPLEY (gathering up the records) I love jazz. 
DICKIE (holding up a Chet Baker) This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz. 
MARGE I never said that! 
RIPLEY Bird. That's jazz. 
DICKIE Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat - 
RIPLEY I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat? 
DICKIE Bird!

JULIE I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds. 
TED But you triple-dog-dared me. 
JULIE It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way. 
CHARLIE One word, my friend. One word. MEATLOAF. 
Ted lifts his head.  Looks in the mirror.  Distraught. 
TED There's gotta be more to life than meatloaf. 
INT. THE NELSON KITCHEN - EVENING 
Not a hair above middle class. Home sweet home nonetheless. Dinner in progress. MOM, DAD, Ted, younger brother, JIMMY. A mutt named CORKY curled under the table. A storm brews. Lightning in the distance. Thunder RUMBLES. 
Ted's Mom observes her son with unmistakable Mom-radar. She slides a slab of - rotten timing! - MEAT LOAF onto his plate with an unpleasant thud. Ted shudders... 
TED If I never eat another bite of meat loaf again, it'll be too soon. 
Ted's Mom frowns. Jimmy explains matter-of-factly. 
JIMMY Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed. 
TED Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store! 
Ted's parents look at one another, shake their heads. His Dad gently explains... 
DAD We heard about Christy, son. 
Jimmy tries to stifle a grin. 
TED What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day? 
MOM No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you. 
TED I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town! 
DAD We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous... (catches himself) We...uh...we understand your disappointment. 
TED It's my private business! Mine! 
MOM Can the tantrum, sweet pea. We're the good guys, remember? 
JIMMY Mom, Dad. Don't allow this disturbing behavior to furrow your collective brow. Ted's just experiencing some post-adolescent turmoil, coming to terms with the whole "small town dynamic." 
TED I hate Xenia! I hate my life! 
Ted charges for the front door... 
TED (V.O.) (CONT'D) And until that moment, this was the worst day of my seventeen and a half years. And then it happened. Three, two, one... 
EXT. NELSON HOUSE - EVENING 
Ted bursts outside and plows straight into MARTY ZUKERMAN, a short, rotund man in his mid-50s. 
TED Whoa! Sorry, mister. 
Zukerman's briefcase and papers are knocked to the ground. Ted helps to retrieve them. 
ZUKERMAN In a hurry, are we? 
TED I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling? 
ZUKERMAN Bad news. 
TED People pay good money for that? 
ZUKERMAN I'm just a messenger. 
Ted starts to back away. Instinctively knowing the bad news must be for him. 
TED Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day. 
ZUKERMAN It's about your parents.

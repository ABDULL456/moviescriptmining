(shows Earth saved) without shield... (shows Earth destroyed) Sorry to say I told you so. \nZED I wanted to build one years ago, but Kay talked me out of it. \nJAY Kay talked you out of it? Kay wouldn't do that. He's the most distrustful person in the galaxy. He personally set up that system to defend our planet from the scum of the universe. \n\" KAY\u00c2\u0080\u008e I thought we didn't have any enemies anymore. A stranger's just a friend you haven't met. \nJAY Yeah, that's working out great. Look, I don't know what's frying everyone's brains, but I remember the missile shield --- Kay -- the real Kay -- loved that thing. He wouldn't shut up about it. I mean, that thing was all Kay. \n(REALIZING) But Kay's dead. He's been dead for years. But I knew him yesterday. Jay looks at the YAZ file. Gears turning. He grabs a picture of Yaz -- \nJAY (CONT'D) Where the hell did he.get an iPhone in 1969? \nEXTREME CLOSE UP ON PICTURE -- Peeking out of Yaz's jacket -- an iPhone. Something clicks -- \nJAY (CONT'D) \n(REMEMBERING) Kay said Yaz can get you anywhere, anytime. Any TIME. So Yaz killed Kay in 1969 and now there's no missile shield. Jay realizes something and RUNS OFF \nOKAY\" I love you, Jay! \nJAY You're definitely not Kay! \nJAY RUNS THROUGH MIB He runs by people dealing with the world coming to an end: \nCOMPUTER (V.0.) Nine minutes to impact. I always loved you, microwave... \nOn the microwave -- it beeps plaintively. Jay runs off with purpose... \nSTREETS OF NYC July in the city. A perfect summer day. Kids eat ice cream. Old ladies head to matinees. The streets of New York team with humanity, blissfully unaware that they are about to die. In other words, a Tuesday. Jay runs through Time Square, where guys sell stuff on blankets. Desperately looking for someone... Among the sellers, a suspicious-looking guy wearing a strange mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat. As soon as he sees Jay, his eyes go wide and HE FLEES. Jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him -- lays him out. \nJAY Where you going in such a hurry, Obadiah? The past? \nOBADIAH What are you talking about? He throws his arms up, revealing a pocket watch and a telescope. \nJAY I know you've been time-travelling. \nOBADIAH No way, man. I've just been here, totally legit, here in New Amsterdam. I mean -- Manahatta ... n I'm legit. \nJAY Yeah? What's this? Reveal the thing he just hit him with -- a ship's bell with S.S. TITANIC on it. \nOBADIAH I swear, I'm out of that. That's my grandmother's. \nJAY What else you got here? \nOBADIAH Nothing, nothing man. \nJAY Oh, yeah? Off a Dodo in a cage. \nJAY (CONT'D) Is that a dodo bird? \n", "test1_true": "JAY I think he'd be happier free. Jay frees the bird -- it runs, squawking... \nOBADIAH Oh, come on, man! \nJAY Interesting. Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket. Featuring chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire. \nOBADIAH That's pirated, man. That ain't nothing. Jay rips open his jacket -- \nJAY And this? Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence.. \nOBADIAH Okay, okay, maybe I've been time travelling a little -- just for personal use, man, just enough to \nGET BY-- \nJAY Listen -- I'll look the other way if you tell me who's selling time travel these days. I just want your supplier. \nOBADIAH No way, man. You don't mess with that guy. He'll kill you, me, and then he'll go after our families! \nJAY Don't worry, he won't have time. \nOBADIAH What do you mean? Jay forces the guy to look up-- we see the missiles. \nJAY Those hit the sun in 8 minutes. You want to live out those minutes? Or you want me to take you out of your misery? Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss -- off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head. \nOBADIAH Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't warn you, man. You just signed your own death warrant. \nJAY I just want a name. \nOBADIAH Fine, but it's the last one you'll ever hear. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON THE MOST NON-THREATENING FACE EVER Think Michael Cera at his most geeky. \nCERA Hi, I'm Trevor! Reveal -- we are in \nAPPLE STORE And Trevor is an \"Apple Genius\" \nTREVOR Do you have an appointment? \nJAY \nNO--- \nTREVOR \n(CHIPPER) Well, if you don't have an appointment, you'll have to come back tomorrow. \nJAY Yeah, well, the thing about tomorrow is, we'll all be busy being dead. \nTREVOR Excuse me? \nJAY Help me, or the world is gonna end. \n", "test1_id": 2352, "test2_input": "JAY Aren't you gonna give me a.gun? \nKAY Right. He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands it over. \nKAY (CONT'D) Try not to get in my way. \nJAY You try not to get in MY way. Jay and Kay move towards the building... BAM! BAM! BAM!! Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover. More GUNSHOTS -- Jay gives Kay THE SIGNAL, WE SAW IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANT \nKAY What the hell is that? \nJAY Stay behind me. You need to stay alive. \nKAY The hell I will. Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes in first. \nVINCENZI BROTHERS Jay and Kay bust in -- almost fall into the room because they're squabbling over who's first -- Then - BAM! \nSomeone's hiding under a desk, holding a gun over his head, firing randomly. Kay gets GRAZED -- They dive for cover. Kay's right hand is bleeding. \nJAY Huh. So that's how you got the scar. Jay tosses his EMPTY GUN into the corner -- the guy under the desk fires FIVE TIMES - EMPTYING HIS GUN! Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified, quivering WISEGUY. Jay grabs him and DISARMS HIM. The guy is FREAKED OUT. \nWISEGUY \n[TERRIFIED BLUBBERING] \nJAY What'd he look like? \nWISEGUY \n[BLUBBERING] \nJAY Pull it together! Jay SLAPS THE GUY. \nJAY (CONT'D) The guy who did this --- what'd he look like? \nWISEGUY Looked like a biker... And he had a... He had a skull ring... Jay and Kay share a look. \nJAY That's him. \nBACK WITH JAY AND KAY Walking up to Kay's car. In the background, MiB puts up a facade around the rocket -- \"Rocket Waste Disposal\", techs take samples. \nJAY What about the witness? We don't have time to take him back to HQ to \nNEURALIZE HIM-- \nKAY We've got something new. Portable Neuralizer. With a rumbling and BLASTS OF AIRHORNS, 18-wheelers drive up, housing the \"portable\" Neuralizer. \nKAY (CONT'D) Can you believe how small these things are getting? \nJAY Yeah. \nKAY Okay, slick. I'm making a decision to believe you. Not because I do, but because I have to, you get me? He walks to the trunk, pops it open. He flips a switch, revealing a HIDDEN ARSENAL. He grabs a COOL GUN and gives it to Jay. Jay admires the \nDEADLY FIREARM. \n", "test2_true": "KAY Let's go get this sunovabitch. They climb in but -- SCREECH!!! A Crown Vic swerves to a stop in front of them. Out pops an \nAPOPLECTIC EX -- \nEX Kay! Don't move a goddamn muscle! I have you on 12 protocol violations! Kay looks to Jay. \nKAY Make it thirteen. He GUNS IT -- THEY TEAR OFF... \nYAZ'S BIKE Widen - he's on his bike, pulling into \nNEW YORK CITY - TOLLBOOTH ON THE BRIDGE Yaz approaches the tollbooth, manned by a gruff NY no-BS, no- time for anyone TOLLBOOTH COLLECTOR. \nTOLLBOOTH COLLECTER Exact change only. \nYAZ Can you help a stranger, please? \nTOLLBOOTH COLLECTER Oh, sure. That's what I'm here for. You see that thing behind you? That's New Jersey. Go home and get some change. \nYAZ There's been a great injustice in the Universe. I must make it right. \nTOLLBOOTH COLLECTER You know what's also a great injustice? Sitting in this box all day listening to people try to get out of paying the toll. \nYAZ Let me ease your pain. On Yaz's evil grin... \nKAY AND JAY DRIVE INTO THE CITY \nKAY Now tell me everything you know about this Yaz scumbag. \nJAY In two days he's gonna kill you in Florida. \nKAY Two days. Doesn't give me a lot of time. You couldn't have come back a week ago? \nJAY Sorry, I was distracted by the Earth blowing up. \nKAY So we have two days to kill him before he kills me. Alright, there's one cesspool everyone washes up in sooner or later. Someone'll know something there. Come on. Let's take a drive to Alien Town. \nJAY Alien Town? They drive under a sign indicating: EAST VILLAGE \nWITH YAZ Cruising through NY. Devil Girl on the seat behind him. He pulls even with a patrol car. \nYAZ Excuse me, officers of the law. Like you, I care a great deal. about justice and I'm looking for some people. Maybe you can help me. \nOFFICER Okay -- get a shave and a haircut.. They laugh. Yaz smiles sadly. \nYAZ Have you ever lost someone close to you? I have. I've lost everyone. Everyone except them. Can you help me find them? He gives the cops a picture, they take it grudgingly -- we see it: a half dozen hippies wearing medallions. The cops look at each other and raise eyebrows. \nOFFICER Only one part of town where people like that hang out... \nEXT. THE DECKER BUILDING \nThe historic Village landmark. Jay and Kay approach... 60s freaks eyeball the squares... \nIN THE ELEVATOR Jay and Kay ride to the sixth floor. \n", "test2_id": 2353, "test3_input": "JAY There's gotta be something that connects you to Yaz. What cases are you working on? \nKAY Well, I'got this whole dry ice thing. \nJAY Dry ice? What's that? Someone get killed over some dry ice? Smuggling something in some dry ice? \nKAY No. We just can't figure out what it is. \nJAY Wow, you're pretty low on the totem pole, aren't you? The great Kay, looking for dry ice. \nKAY Don't push your luck. The doors open, and we're in... \nA WAY-OUT 60'S PARTY Kay's on the hunt for someone. They weave their way through the far-out types, hear snippets of high-60s party conversations. Someone notices Jay's suit -- \nPARTY SNOB What are you, a time traveller? \nJAY REACTS-- \nPARTY SNOB (CONT'D) That suit is SO five years ago. Kay sees who he's looking for, grabs him: \nKAY We need to talk. Reveal ANDY WARHOL -- and this is the Factory, and this is one of Warhols' famous parties. Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his \"stars.\" \nULTRAVIOLET Yum, pigs are getting cute. Jay smiles -- she looks skeeved out. \nULTRAVIOLET (CONT'D) I meant the young one. Warhol speaks with his strange -- yes, almost alien -- affect. \nWARHOL It's not really a good time to talk. I'm creating a party. (sighs, totally put out) But... Maybe if he asks me. \nJAY What - me? \nWARHOL I would never say no to anything that came out of that beautiful mouth... Jay is visibly uncomfortable. Kay nudges Jay - do it. \nJAY [Grumbles about what he has to do for his partner]. (then, to Warhol) We need to talk. Please. Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay. Someone snaps a picture. \nWARHOL Amazing, just amazing. Alright, you talked me into it. Follow me. \n(MORE) \nWARHOL (CONT'D) \n(TO ENTOURAGE) Be back soon, stars. \nPRIVATE STUDIO LOFT From here, a window looks out over the whole scene. Warhol leads the guys in, shuts the door and LOCKS IT. Immediately, his ENTIRE AFFECT CHANGES -- he rips off his WIG, lights a cigarette, and talks like a hard-nosed cop. \nWARHOL Damnit, Kay, are you TRYING to blow my cover? \nKAY Take it easy agent W, your cover is perfectly safe. \nWARHOL Perfectly safe? Are you out of your goddamned mind? It's only a matter of time before they figure out I'm a total fraud. \nKAY Cool your jets-- \nWARHOL I'm so out of ideas I'm painting bananas and soup cans for chrissakes. How long do you really think they're gonna keep buying this shit? Warhol slumps on a chair. \n", "test3_true": "KAY Yeah, I know they are, buddy. But you're doing good work here. We need you. A knock at the door -- Warhol gets back into character -- \nWARHOL I'll be right there... I'm just... filming these men eating a hamburger... It's... transcendent. Okay, now the pickle... (back to cop form) You see what I mean? And who the hell's this guy? New partner? \nJAY Actually, I'm his old partner. I came from the future to warn him \nABOUT-- \nWARHOL Jesus, fine, don't tell me. Alright, what do you need? \nJAY We're looking for a recent arrival. Long hair, wears a lot of leather... Warhol indicates the party below -- half the guests match that description. \nWARHOL You'll have to do better than that. Look, if that's all you have, I can't help you. \nKAY Maybe you know someone who's seen something. \nSTAR (O.S.) Andy, the horse is here... \nWARHOL I gotta get back in there-- \nJAY Hold up -- the guy we're looking for -- he's out to destroy the world. \nWARHOL C'mon, what's new? What does an MiE call it when someone tries to destroy the world? Tuesday. \nJAY I thought you made that up. \nKAY C'mon, W, I got a feeling on this one. Like we should take it serious. And we don't have much time. Jay checks his watch. \nJAY 33 hours. \nWARHOL Yeah, yeah, alright. \n(THINKS) Okay, talk to Prell and Vidal. C'mon. \nIN THE PARTY ON TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - in very 60s fashion with incredibly giant hair - one with a big afro, one with big chignon hairdo. \nWARHOL (O.S.) (back in \"character\") Vidal, Prell, can you please talk to these nice men? The women's LIPS DON'T MOVE -- they respond in incongruously \nGRUFF VOICES: \nPRELL Whadaya want? \nVIDAL They look like cops to me. ain't talking. \nPRELL We're not rats. We swing around them to REVEAL that Warhol/Kay/Jay are not talking to the women's faces -- They're STANDING BEHIND THE WOMEN -- TALKING TO THEIR HAIR- DO'S which we realize are two COMPLETE HAIR ALIENS, VIDAL and PRELL, perched atop these women. \nKAY Start talking, you two, before you end up on a barber's floor. \nPRELL Ah, you don't scare me. \nKAY Yeah? Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out HAIRSPRAY. Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray. \nPRELL You wouldn't! He sprays the hair, it starts to SCREAM IN PAIN. \n", "test3_id": 2354}

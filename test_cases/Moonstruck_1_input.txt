INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT -DINING ROOM - DAY 
CU of Ronny's artificial hand, holding a fork stuck in a steak. With his right he is cutting his steak. He switches hands and eats hungrily. Loretta watches. 
RONNY This is good. Uhh... 
LORETTA Loretta. 
RONNY Where'd Johnny find you? 
LORETTA He knew my husband who died. 
RONNY How'd he die? 
LORETTA Bus hit him. 
RONNY Fast. 
LORETTA Instantaneous. 
RONNY When you get engaged? 
LORETTA Yesterday. 
Ronny drops his knife and fork and turns away. Loretta is not surprised and does not move. 
RONNY Why? 
LORETTA Why what? 
RONNY I don't know. 
LORETTA (smiles) So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then? 
RONNY No. 
LORETTA Stupid.

LORETTA No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky. 
RONNY I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that. 
LORETTA What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear? 
RONNY Why you talking to me? 
LORETTA You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?

BAKER It's too late, Jill. 
JILL (adamant) No.   It's too soon. 
(CONTINUED) 
73   CONTINUED:                                                        73 
Baker gives Jill a hard look. 
BAKER Miss Young, let me give you some advice. Stop worrying about Joe, and start worrying about what you'll wear tomorrow night. 
With that, Baker gives Jill his back and starts a phone call. Frustrated, Jill turns and walks out of the room. 
74   EXT. CONSERVANCY GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      74 
Jill storms out of Baker's office stewing, head down. She's walking so fast that she collides into a man coming the other way. 
JILL Oh!   Excuse me. 
The man rights himself and smiles politely. 
STRASSER No, excuse me.     My fault. 
It's Strasser. He's tamed his looks and dressed himself in modest attire. With his damaged hand concealed in his pocket and a pleasant smile arranged on his face, he has re-invented himself. He comes across like a friendly conservationist. 
He stares openly at Jill.       It flusters her. 
STRASSER (feigning surprise) I'm so sorry -- it's just -- you must be Jill Young... 
JILL Yes...? 
STRASSER ("moved") And -- you look just like her. 
The words electrify Jill.       She almost gasps. 
STRASSER I'm Andre Strasser. An old friend of your mother's. (warmly) I knew her when she was only a little older than you, and you were just a tiny thing. What an incredible woman she was. (CONTINUED) 
74   CONTINUED:                                                      74 
Jill is overwhelmed.     She immediately melts.   She reaches her hand out to him. 
JILL How wonderful to meet you.   What are you doing here? 
Strasser pretends to look uncomfortable. 
STRASSER I've come to talk with your Mr. Baker. (pained) You see, I am here for Joe. And, in a way, for your mother, too. (passionate) I believe she would agree with me -- a magnificent wild animal like Joe needs more space -- like the Raha Preserve I run in Botswana. 
Bingo.   Jill's face falls.    The guilt is working already. 
JILL Raha?   A preserve? 
STRASSER I have twenty thousand acres there where the animals are free to run. I would like to offer them to Joe. (sighs) Here, it's such a shame... to see Joe living in a man-made habitat and being used as an attraction to raise money... 
Strasser shakes his head at the inhumanity of it all. His clever words work on Jill like a charm -- she looks absolutely crestfallen. He pretends to comfort her. 
STRASSER Oh -- I've upset you! Please... I only mean to offer an alternative. I will be attending the event tomorrow night. Maybe we can talk more about this matter then. 
JILL I'll look forward to it. 
STRASSER Good-bye. 
Strasser walks off, leaving Jill deep in thought. He smiles to himself, certain he's landed a direct hit. 
75   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - NIGHT                                     75 
A tent has been set up outside Joe's habitat, the long end flush up against the railing that surrounds the moat. 
CUT TO: 
76   INT. TENT - NIGHT                                              76 
A small, elegant and tasteful party. A collection of fifty VIPs, all dressed to the nines, mingle with the conservancy staff. Tables have been arranged in a wide semi-circle around a podium, which is on the moat edge of the tent. 
BY BAR 
Gregg, wearing a tuxedo, walks up to Cecily and Harry, also in black tie. Harry is stuffing his face. 
Cecily looks admiringly at Gregg. 
CECILY Don't you clean up nice. 
GREGG Cecily -- you're ravishing. Harry -- you got shrimp on your shirt. 
Harry looks down at his shirt smeared with cocktail sauce. 
HARRY (dismayed) Of course. I look ridiculous. 
CECILY No.  You look fine. (pointing at Jack and Vern) They look ridiculous. 
Jack and Vern are off the dweeb-scale in their ill-fitting tuxes. They crowd the food table, gobbling down appetizers. 
HARRY Hel-lo.   Look what we have here. 
Gregg and Cecily turn to see what Harry's looking at. 
(CONTINUED) 
76   CONTINUED:                                                      76 
BY ENTRANCE 
Jill has just stepped into the tent, looking absolutely stunning. All heads turn too look at her. Intimidated, she falters at the door, too afraid to enter. 
BACK ON STAFF 
Like everyone else in the room, Cecily and Harry admire Jill. Gregg is rendered speechless by her beauty. 
CECILY (proud) I picked out the dress.   Aren't I smart?

Bath Lady [poking out of her building]:  Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? The matchmaker is not a patient woman.  [She goes back into the building] 
Fa Li:  Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for luck. 
Grandma Fa [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]:  How lucky can they be, they're dead.  Besides,  I've got all the luck we'll need.  [Speaking to Cri-Kee]  This is your chance to prove yourself.  [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street] 
Fa Li [excitedly]:  Grandma No! 
[The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two horse and carriage collide causing a big accident.  She arrives at the other side of the street, uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee] 
Grandma Fa:  Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of fright] 
Fa Li [sighing in relief]:  Hai. 
[Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and jumps off with hay stuck in her hair] 
Mulan: I'm here.  [Seeing a stern look from her mother] What?  But Mama I had to-- 
Fa Li:  None of your 'xcuses.  Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk together into the preparation area] 
[Song: Honor to us all] 
Bath Lady:  [all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the Bath] This is what you give me to work with? Well, honey, I've seen worse. We're gonna turn this sow's ear Into a silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in the bath] 
Mulan [spoken]:  It's freezing. 
Fa Li [spoken]:  It would have been warm if you were here on time. 
Bath Lady [washing Mulan's hair]: We'll have you Washed and dried Primped and polished till you glow with pride Trust my recipe for instant bride You'll bring honor to us all 
Fa Li [grabbing a sponge and Mulan's right arm to start cleaning her.  She notices the writing] [spoken]:  Mulan, what's this? 
Mulan [Drawing her arm back and batting her eyelashes] [spoken]:  Ahh, notes, in case I forget something? 
Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Here, hold this [hands the cricket to Fa Li].  We'll need more luck than I thought.  [Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment]

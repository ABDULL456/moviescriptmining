Gabriel walks with Sierra. The trees here are taller, creating a cathedral-like ceiling above them. 
SIERRA Okay, confession.    I kind of recognized you. 
GABRIEL Really? 
SIERRA I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had. You're, like, the shit. 
GABRIEL No. 
SIERRA You're like the Quentin Tarantino of that world. A videogame God. 
GABRIEL Not really. 
SIERRA Fine. 
GABRIEL You seriously recognized me off of one photo? 
SIERRA I thought you were kinda hot. Considering. 
GABRIEL Considering..? 
SIERRA Within the subset of videogame people. 
GABRIEL Okay. 
SIERRA I wasn't masturbating to your picture or anything. 
GABRIEL Well, I guess I'm flattered. 
SIERRA You should be. I'm stingy with compliments. 
GABRIEL So your boyfriend plays videogames? 
SIERRA Ex-boyfriend. And yes. Way too many. He used to play Evercrack back in the day, but yours, well, that was like...what's worse than crack? 
GABRIEL Super-crack? 
SIERRA Sure.   He was this orc witch doctor guy. 
GABRIEL Shaman? 
SIERRA Yeah. At one point he was spending like, 40 hours a week gathering "thunderleaf" or whatever. (MORE) 
SIERRA (CONT'D) Then I was his mule, hauling it around because he ran out of space. 
GABRIEL You had an account? 
SIERRA I was part of your world, and you didn't even know it. 
GABRIEL Sorry. 
SIERRA You can make it up to me. 
EXT. ROAD NEAR PRIUS - DAY 
Mary is pacing -- but trying not to look like she's pacing. She holds the other cell phone (Gabriel's), which she turns on and off, hoping that somehow she'll get a signal. 
Each time she turns it on, we hear the CHIMES. 
IN THE PRIUS 
Noelle is still playing with the video camera, watching footage of the hike. She decides to wind back further. 
CLOSE ON the blocky pixels rushing past. 
Noelle hits "play."   For now, we just hear the audio. 
MAN'S VOICE ...I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry. 
We reveal the screen. We're watching the argument between Gavin and Melissa from Part 2. 
MELISSA (ON TAPE) So it's done. Finished. Decided. 
GAVIN (ON TAPE) Yeah. 
Confused, Noelle looks out at her mother, Mary, who is still pacing with the cell phone. 
MELISSA (ON TAPE) I understand.

83   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY 
Back to the present: 
MARTHA Are you frightened? 
AGNES Yes. 
84   INT - BARN - NIGHT 
In flashback: the doves continue to make flapping and bumping sounds as they fly around the barn. 
AGNES Hallo... 
85   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY 
In the present: 
AGNES ... where are you? 
86   INT - BARN - NIGHT 
In flashback: 
AGNES Is it you? 
Then she seems to be talking to someone although we can see nothing except the doves. 
AGNES (Cont.) I... I'm afraid... yes, yes I do... why me?... wait, I want to see you. 
MARTHA (V.O.) What do you see? 
87   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY 
In the present: 
AGNES Halos... 
88   INT - BARN - NIGHT 
In flashback: Agnes is still in the barn but now she is lying on her back. Still all we can see are doves flashing in the light. 
AGNES (V.O.) ... dividing and dividing feathers and starts, falling, falling into the iris of God's eye. Oh... oh!... it's... it's so lovely... it's so... blue... yellow... blood wings, brown, blood... 
And she lifts up her hands. 
89   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY 
In the present: as she lifts up her hands, Agnes is horrified to see two holes in her palms weeping blood. 
AGNES His blood... my God... 
Martha and Mother Miriam are equally shocked. 
MARTHA Oh Agnes... 
Agnes runs terrified over to the walls blood pouring over her 
white habit.    Mother Miriam rushes after her. 
AGNES It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop. (to Mother Miriam) Let go of me, I wish you were dead. 
MARTHA (trying to hold her) Agnes... Agnes... 
Agnes breaks free and runs over to another wall smearing it too with blood.     Martha follows her.

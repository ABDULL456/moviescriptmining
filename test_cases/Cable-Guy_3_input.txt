He sits in a chair, and leans over in pain. 
CABLE GUY She's clean I assure you. I tried her out last week to make sure she was top quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not a drip. She's the best, ask any of my friends. 
Steven cringes. 
STEVE You've got to be kidding? Please tell me she's a friend of yours. You're just playing with my mind again, right? 
CABLE GUY I wish I had friends like that. 
STEVEN Get out of my house! 
CABLE GUY Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she was a working girl, but she kind of liked you. You might have been able to get a freebie. 
STEVEN Out, now! I don't ever want to see you again. (to himself) Robin is never going to forgive me. 
CABLE GUY I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't tell her. You want to get her back, I'll help you get her back. 
STEVEN I don't want your help. I want you to leave. (gestures to the TV) And take that stuff out of here. 
CABLE GUY (calmly) Whatever. I can take a hint. I'll see ya'. 
The Cable Guy exits. 
42	OMITTED 
43	EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
P.O.V. Shot - Robin and a date enter the restaurant. 
We move to reveal the Cable Guy driving up in his van. He watches them from across the street. A moment later he heads inside. 
44	INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
The Cable Guy enters the restaurant. The HOSTESS walks over to him. 
HOSTESS May I help you? 
CABLE GUY No, I'm meeting someone here. 
He looks around the restaurant, then spots Robin and a handsome, chiseled man at a table. They are on a date. The Cable Guy looks angry. He walks to the restroom. 
45	INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT 
An OLDER BATHROOM ATTENDANT stands in front of the sinks. On the counter sits a variety of toiletries. A MAN washes his hands. The bathroom attendant hands him some paper towels. The man puts a tip in the basket, and exits. 
BATHROOM ATTENDANT Most appreciated. 
The Cable Guy walks over to the bathroom attendant. He dramatically whips out a twenty dollar bill, and puts it in front of the bathroom attendant's nose. 
CABLE GUY You've been working hard. Take a break. 
46	INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER 
Robin is talking to her date RAY. He is handsome, and somewhat goofy. They have empty salad plates in front of them. 
RAY My brother and I wanna start our own sun block company. But the twist is, it's only for skiing. SkiBlock. Or SunSki. We haven't decided yet. Maybe BlockSki. Do you think that sounds good? 
ROBIN BlockSki? That sounds right. 
RAY So, Gail told me you're just coming off a relationship. 
ROBIN Well, not really. We're kind of in a holding pattern. He wants more of a commitment, but I don't think I'm ready. I just want to have a good time for a while. 
RAY Then we got to get you on a Skidoo! 
ROBIN Skidoo? 
RAY High powered snow mobile. It'll blow your mind. It flies over powder like it's glass. 
Their waitress passes by. 
RAY (impatiently) Hey, how are you doing on that chicken? Have the eggs hatched yet? Thanks. 
Robin is mortified by his behavior. 
RAY So, how's your work going? 
ROBIN It's been crazy. They just hired a Â–

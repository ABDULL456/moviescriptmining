JETSON My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'. 
SYKES Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you? 
EXT.  POLICE STATION PARKING AREA - DAY 
They approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile. 
SYKES Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care? 
JETSON That is exactly so. (completely deadpan) It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium". 
Sykes looks at him, perplexed. 
JETSON "Shit... head". 
Jetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing there, the smirk dropping from his face. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAY 
They're cruising along in downtown traffic.  Sykes drives. Jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat. 
SYKES Let's talk Hubley. 
JETSON (refers to a folder he holds) His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown. 
SYKES With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest. 
JETSON (gently correcting him) Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts. 
SYKES (out the window) Nice signal, dickwad! 
Jetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from Sykes. Then... 
JETSON He was employed at the Northwest Petroleum Refinery in Torrance.  He was manager of the Methane Facility. He was also a principle partner in a real estate venture to develop low- cost housing for Newcomers. 
Sykes grimaces at the mention of "Newcomer housing". 
SYKES Terrific.  A real pillar of the community. (beat) Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off? 
JETSON (checks file) There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings. 
SYKES The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George... 
JETSON The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said-- 
Sykes looks over at Jetson, pissed. 
SYKES Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along? 
JETSON Yes. 
SYKES Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand? (Jetson nods) Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him. 
Jetson considers this several moments, then-- 
JETSON And as my partner, I ask you to respect me and my desire not to break with procedure. 
Sykes stares at him, exasperated.  Without warning, he slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy traffic, puts it in "Park." Jetson, who is already a little too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it. HORNS instantly go crazy behind them. 
JETSON What is wrong? 
SYKES (very calm) Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right? 
YELLING joins the HORNS outside.  Jetson is visibly unsettled by the chaos. 
JETSON Well... yes, quite possibly.

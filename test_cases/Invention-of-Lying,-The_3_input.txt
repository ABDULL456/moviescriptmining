MARK Come on guys. Are you serious? What's my name? 
GREG It's Doug. 
JIM Doug. 
MARK No. My name is Mark. 
GREG (still dead serious) Your name is Mark. 
JIM (still without hesitation) Hi Mark. 
GREG Mark suits you much better. 
JIM Mark-o. 
MARK You guys aren't following me. (THINKING) Okay, guys...I'm black. 
GREG I knew it. 
JIM You're very light skinned, but I can see it. 
GREG I've always wanted a black friend. 
Mark punches the bar in anger. 
MARK Fuck it, I'm an Eskimo. 
GREG Fantastic. 
JIM I've never seen a black Eskimo. 
MARK Okay, I'm a pirate. 
GREG I didn't know they still had those. 
JIM Are you a dangerous pirate? 
MARK Okay then, I'm a lion tamer... and I have purple hair. 
GREG Aren't you scared you'll get bitten one day? 
JIM (to Greg) I want to die my hair purple just like Mark's. 
Greg nods. Mark sighs. 
INSERT: "TWO HOURS LATER" 
Mark sits at the bar looking completely bored. 
JIM I'm a one-armed Jewish space explorer. 
GREG When's your launch date? 
JIM Shalom. How'd you lose your arm? 
MARK I invented the bicycle. 
GREG I love your work. 
JIM Can you get me a discount on a ten speed? 
Mark sighs, finishes his beer and gets up to leave. 
MARK I give up. And I'm bored. 
Mark heads towards the door, dejected. He turns back. 
MARK Guys, if you had the power to make things the way you wanted them, what would you do first? 
GREG If I could do anything in the world? 
JIM Anything at all? 
MARK Pretty much. 
Greg and Jim think this over long and hard. 
GREG I'd bone bitches asses.

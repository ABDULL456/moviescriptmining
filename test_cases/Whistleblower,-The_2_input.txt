CARMEN Hey, where've you been? 
KATHY I'll tell you about it over a drink. Could you just check something for me? I want to get a copy of the monitor's report from a raid on the Florida Bar yesterday. 
Carmen nods, and clicks on her computer. 
CARMEN Your job is so exciting. The only thing I get to raid is the fridge. (Reading off the computer)... You sure there was a raid? There's no record here. 
KATHY No. That's definitely it. There were six girls removed from the bar and I need to know where they were taken. TWB 36. 
CARMEN Sorry. No record of any raid. 
Kathy thinking. Something's not adding up. 
66   INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING                         66 
Kathy walks. MONITORS greet her as she passes. She reaches an OFFICE, and knocks. 
KATHY I'm looking for Fred Murray? 
67   EXT. MINE FIELD - BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                    67 
FIVE local MEN in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand- held minesweepers. One MAN holds up his hand as his device BEEPS. At the edge of the field, Fred Murray blows a whistle. Everybody else STOPS. The man bends down, as all wait... 
Kathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. Fred smiles. 
FRED MURRAY We meet again! 
Kathy looks out, suddenly aware of the dangerous situation. 
KATHY Is it okay for me to be here? 
FRED MURRAY Sure, sure. You're fine here on the gravel. What's going on? 
KATHY I just wanted to follow up with you on the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to locate them. 
FRED MURRAY Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a mess. Turned out it was a local police mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or something. Thought they had a prostitution bust, but the bar is legit and those girls were just waitresses. 
KATHY Waitresses aren't kept under lock and key. 
ANOTHER WHISTLE BLOWS. Fred turns to the field. TWB 37. 
FRED MURRAY Shit. Can we go over this later? I got to get in there. 
Before she can answer, Fred is moving down the field. She watches him go. 
68   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - DAY                              68 
Kathy and Milena lead Raya and Irka out to her SUV. 
69   EXT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - DAY                          69 
A stark contrast, the GDA is a new and shining edifice. Kathy's SUV pulls up front. 
70   INT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - MOMENTS LATER                70 
Kathy and the girls sit in the waiting area. The place is modern, western... corporate. In platinum base relief over the reception desk: 
GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY. 
The LOBBY. Magazines on a coffee table. The wall adorned with a HUGE FRAMED POSTER of a young girl in a spiderweb. A caption: "TRAFFIKU ZHINOK YE SPRAV. 1999" 
Kathy scans the hall. Endless posters. 1998, 1997, 1996... 
LAURA LEVIN, 30s, American, groomed, business-like, comes around the corner. Her ASSISTANT, 20s, leads the girls away. 
KATHY Kathy. The new Head of Gender Affairs. 
LAURA LEVIN I heard. Laura Levin. My assistant will take them to the medical center. As soon as they get medical clearance we'll know where we stand. 
KATHY What do you mean? 
LAURA LEVIN Well, it's yet to be determined if they'll cooperate with the repatriation program. That's the only way I can allow them to stay at the GDA. TWB 38. 
KATHY They're critical... witnesses for a situation I'm... monitoring. I'll need to speak with them when they're ready. 
LAURA LEVIN I understand. I'll be in touch. 
KATHY Will you be contacting their parents? 
Laura nods. Something still on Kathy's mind... 
KATHY (CONT'D) The other girls from the raid were supposed to go to the Women's Medica Shelter, but they never showed up. Do you have any idea where else they might have been taken? 
LAURA LEVIN I didn't know there were any others. 
Kathy eyes the girls down the hall. Raya turns, a last look. 
71   INT./EXT. UN SUV/GDA - NIGHT                                   71 
Kathy starts her car. She pulls out, turning left. Then, cranks the wheel right. 
72   EXT. ROAD - NIGHT                                              72 
Kathy's UN SUV swerves along the serpentine mountain road.

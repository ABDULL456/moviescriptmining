TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM - COMMANDER OF THE GERMAN RESERVE ARMY. 
The haggard Fromm sits at his desk, rubbing his temples. Stauffenberg and Olbricht share a confident look. Surely this guy hates the High Command. Without looking up to see them: 
FROMM What is it you want? 
Olbricht hesitates. Fromm looks up. 
FROMM (CONT'D) Well, Olbricht? Speak up. 
OLBRICHT I wanted to introduce you to our new man - Colonel Stauffenberg. 
FROMM Ah yes - the hero from Africa. I'd offer my hand but you might not give it back. 
STAUFFENBERG I'd say the General's lost more important things this morning. 
Freeze. But after a tense beat, Fromm relaxes and laughs, taking a cigarette from a box on his desk and nudging it toward them. 
FROMM About time they put a man with balls in this office. Have a seat. (to Olbricht) You too, if you must. 
They sit. Fromm lights a cigarette, leans back and exhales a cloud of smoke. We let things sit for awhile. The game of recruitment is about to begin and no one is sure where to start. The longer the quiet, the more awkward things seem. Finally: 
FROMM (CONT'D) They tell me you're critical of the war, Colonel. Not that you don't seem to have good reason. 
STAUFFENBERG I am critical of losing the war, General. All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision. 
FROMM In the field, you mean. 
He's baiting Stauffenberg to talk shit about Hitler. 
STAUFFENBERG In Berlin. 
FROMM I take it that's why you're here. To make decisions. 
STAUFFENBERG I've made my decision, General. I`m here to help others make theirs. 
Stauffenberg makes no attempt to shade his delivery. He is quite clearly indicating that he means more. Fromm knows it, but he's being coy. 
FROMM They say when there's no clear option, one should do nothing. 
STAUFFENBERG We're at war. We must act. Sometimes... rashly. 
FROMM Just what sort of rash action did you have in mind, Colonel? 
STAUFFENBERG That would be a decision for the Supreme Military Commander. 
Fromm is getting the message. He takes a deep drag. 
FROMM Supreme Commander, you say. 
STAUFFENBERG Second only to the Chancellor. 
FROMM If only I were that man... This war would be going quite differently. 
OLBRICHT We were thinking the very same thing. 
Fromm frowns at Olbricht. This was a bit too obvious. Stauffenberg shoots Olbricht a look. "What the hell are you doing?" 
Fromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the ashtray and picks up the telephone. 
Olbricht and Stauffenberg steel their nerves - certain they are going to be reported. But Fromm doesn't dial. Instead, to our relief, he disconnects the line. When he is certain that it is dead: 
FROMM I don't need to remind you that we've all sworn an oath. That said, I'm going to forget we had this conversation with the understanding that such speak will never occur under this roof again. Am I clear? 
STAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT Yes, sir. 
FROMM Tell   your friends that I always come   down on the right side. And as long   as the FÃ¼hrer is alive, you know   what side that is. 
FROMM (CONT'D) (raising his hand) Heil Hitler. 
33   INT. WAR MINISTRY - CORRIDOR- CONTINUOUS                  33 
OLBRICHT (trying to be upbeat) I think that went rather well. 
STAUFFENBERG Yes... Quite. 
34   EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAY                              34

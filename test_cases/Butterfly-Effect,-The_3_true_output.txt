EVAN Then you think it might have worked out? 
KAYLEIGH Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends. 
She looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically. Tears streak down Evan's face as he speaks in a pleading tone. 
EVAN Would it make any difference if I told you that no one could possibly love anyone as much as I love you? 
Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up. Evan turns to see Lenny waving her over. She puts her hand on Evan's shoulder, stands and goes to Lenny. 
Evan can't take his eyes off her. 
ANGLE ON 
Lenny kissing Kayleigh. In painful slo-mo. Evan turns away, utterly heartbroken. 
INT. HANDICAPPED BATHROOM - DAY 
CLOSE UP 
Evan's stump turns on a BATHTUB FAUCET. 
REVEAL: 
Evan, fully clothed, lies in a bathtub that's filling with water. Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over. 
The water rises past his mouth, to his nostrils -- Evan makes his peace and takes a final breath. 
And the water spills over the side of the tub. All Evan can do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose. 
A beat. Then the door opens. 
TOMMY ENTERS. Immediately sizing up the situation. 
TOMMY You forgot to put the toaster on the edge. 
Tommy casually turns off the water, then pops open the DRAIN. The water level lowers to Evan's mouth. 
EVAN But you, Kayleigh and Lenny like toast. And that's really all that matters now. 
Tommy feels Evan's anguish and plops his ass on the wet floor by the tub. He lays his head onto Evan's shoulder. 
Evan bristles at first, but finally gives in to his hatred, ultimately resting his own head against Tommy's. Taking the comfort offered. 
TOMMY I'll get you changed. Visiting hours are almost up. 
INT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL - EVENING 
Tommy rolls Evan through a quiet hospital corridor. 
EVAN (looking around) What, did mom get transferred again? 
Tommy frowns, confused, then rolls Evan into -- 
INT. ANDREA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Evan is startled to see Andrea hooked up to several IV's, an oxygen tank and a respirator. Several oxygen hoses connect to a tracheotomy tube. 
Tommy smiles and kisses Andrea on the cheek. She tousles his hair in return. 
Evan can hardly speak. As Tommy begins to wheel Evan's chair closer to Andrea's bedside, Andrea utters a faint whisper. 
ANDREA Looking. Good. Kiddo. 
Evan eyes her MEDICAL CLIPBOARD as he's wheeled by. 
EVAN (reading) Lung cancer? 
TOMMY Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately. 
Andrea flinches to hear this. Evan stares at her, eyes wide. 
EVAN Right... You started chain smoking after I blew myself up. 
Evan suddenly seems sick with guilt. 
EVAN There must be a way to fix this. 
ANDREA Fix? 
EVAN I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it. 
A flicker of recognition registers in her eyes. 
ANDREA Is Evan... different? 
TOMMY He's just going through some tough times.

The Cadillac heads overland, along a line of telephone poles that stretches out clear to the horizon. 
HOLLY (v.o.) Through desert and mesa, across the endless miles of open range, we made our headlong way, steering by the telephone lines toward the mountains of Montana. 
DISSOLVE TO 
EXT. MOUNTAIN 
Heat waves rise off the land. A mountain is barely discernible in the distance. 
DISSOLVE TO 
EXT. BADLANDS 
The Cadillac races through a herd of cows, 
HOLLY (v.o.) Kit'd sometimes ram a cow, to save on ammo, and we'd cook it. 
CLOSE ON SALT GRASS 
Tight shot of a clump of salt grass. 
HOLLY (v.o.) Once we had to eat a bunch of salt grass. It tasted like cabbage. 
EXT. BADLANDS - DAWN 
THE CAMERA RISES over the Cadillac as it races down a deserted country road at dawn, 
EXT. PIPELINE WAYSTATION 
The Cadillac is stopped beside a pipeline waystation. Kit has tapped some gas off the head. 
HOLLY (v.o.) For gas we used the leakage from the valves of the pipelines we found along the way. Drip gas is what they call it in that part of the country. 
DISSOLVE TO 
EXT. BADLANDS 
The Cadillac roars through a stand of mesquite and disappears into the distance. 
HOLLY (v.o.) Little by little we approached the border. Kit was glad to leave South Dakota behind and cursed its name. He said that if the Communists ever dropped the atomic bomb, he wished they'd put it right in the middle of Rapid City. 
EXT. CAMPSITE 
They are camped out in the middle of the badlands. Kit cooks some meat over a fire, Holly, with a map under her arm, points into the distance. 
HOLLY That's Montana over there. 
KIT I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to. 
Holly sits down and looks at the map.

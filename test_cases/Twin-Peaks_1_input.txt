LUCY'S VOICE (continued) thing. 
ANDY Okay, Sheriff Truman. 
LUCY'S VOICE Raccoons remind me of my aunt who lives in Wyoming where they have raccoons, too. 
Truman stands up, puts on his gun and leaves.  Lucy's voice continues as we watch Andy sit there alone. 
LUCY'S VOICE (continued) She couldn't get rid of her raccoons because she made the big mistake of feeding them albacore tuna.  I don't know why she fed them albacore tuna. And albacore tuna is so expensive. (voice raising an octave) Sheriff Truman how did you get up here? 
Over the intercom Andy hears Lucy make a small hysterical cry.  He stands and runs from the room.  Stay on the intercom.  Lucy's voice continues.

LAURA (frantically to herself) Go inside...  go inside... 
James' bike sounds closer and closer.  Leland turns, opens the front door and goes into the house.

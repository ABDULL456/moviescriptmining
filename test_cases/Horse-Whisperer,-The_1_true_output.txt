ROBERT It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him... (returns to table, sits) ... Whether or not we were... (beat) ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch. 
Annie just nods. She senses Robert is looking for some kind of reassurance, but she can't give it to him. He continues; 
ROBERT ... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria? 
ANNIE Oh. Right. I'll call him. 
Pause. Annie looks at her husband as he stares off to the side, deep in his thoughts. She can sense he's sinking as he fidgets with the napkins. She remembers: 
MEMORY: 
INT. A SMALLER APARTMENT, KITCHEN - A NIGHT REMEMBERED 
A younger Annie stands in a bathrobe, noticeably pregnant, cooking at a stove -- reading instructions from a propped up cookbook. FRANK SINATRA IS BLASTING as she sings along, in full voice, without inhibitions; 
ANNIE "SHE'S LOVES THE THEATRE BUT NEVER COMES LATE... SHE NEVER BOTHERS WITH PEOPLE SHE HATES... THAT'S WHY THE LADY IS A TRAMP!..." 
A younger Robert, wearing a suit, arrives home from work. Seeing her, he smiles affectionately. He puts down his briefcase and bursts into his own playful Sinatra impersonation: 
ROBERT "She loves the free..." 
Startled, Annie turns around and smiles: 
ROBERT (sexily undoing his tie) "... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'... 
ANNIE (a la fan) Sing it to me, Frankie! 
ROBERT (a la Sinatra cool) How's my pregnant chick! 
She moves to him and they embrace... He wraps his arms around her. They kiss. Annie laughs. 
ANNIE You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early. 
ROBERT I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs. 
ANNIE (loving it) Aw... that's so sweet. 
ROBERT I love you. 
ANNIE Do you? Do you really? 
They turn to each other and kiss. 
END OF MEMORY. 
INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - PRE-DAWN 
Annie and Robert sit silently at the table in an empty hospital cafeteria, a lifetime later. 
INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYBREAK 
The room's lights are dimmed. Dawn is being to break through. 
Grace, slowly, opens her eyes coming out of sedation. She takes a moment to figure out where she is... to remember. 
She uses her hands to hoist herself up, but she's unsteady and knocks into her bedside table -- knocking the Good Luck Charm from India off the table. It rolls under the bed, with a water tumbler. Grace never sees the Charm. 
Grace looks where her leg once was. She feels the blanket, the empty space where her leg once was... just like her mother did (did her father couldn't). Instead of self-pity, she's oddly fascinated. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY 
Daylight pours in. Robert and Annie enter. Robert, loaded with gifts, immediately crosses to Grace, on the side of her good leg. Annie takes her position beside the lost leg. Robert kisses his daughter; 
ROBERT Hi, sweetheart... 
Annie's hand finds Grace's hand, and holds one of her fingers tightly. Grace responds by wrapping her hand around her mother's. They exchange a look of respect and gratitude. 
GRACE Have you heard from Judith's parents? 
ROBERT No, not yet. 
GRACE How's Pilgrim doing? 
ANNIE Liz is taking care of him. (to change the subject) The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can -- 
GRACE I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!! 
Annie, slightly hurt, drops it as Robert takes over: 
ROBERT The doctor said whenever you're ready. Take your time. You tell us... But he thinks it'll only be a few months, then -- 
As Robert continues talking, Annie drifts to the Nurse. Needing to manage something, she asks: 
ANNIE Did you get her fresh towels? 
SOME TIME LATER: 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
A limousine drives up as the Doorman gets the car door. The weather is slightly warmer. People's clothing looks as if spring is coming nearer. 
Annie exits first, carrying a jacket for Grace. She is followed by Robert, who immediately turns to help Grace. We hear her O.S. 
GRACE (O.S.) Dad! I can do it, OK?! 
ROBERT OK, OK. 
Annie shoots him a disapproving look. 
We see Grace's good leg exit first... then two crutches, followed by... a PROSTHETIC LEG. Grace scoots into view, and takes a breath. 
GRACE You all go ahead. I'll be up by Christmas. 
INT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The three sit at a dinner table, eating dinner. Grace picks at her food. Robert can't help staring at her. Annie eats, watching them both. 
ROBERT Do you want something else, honey? We order something else? 
GRACE No, I'm just not that hungry.

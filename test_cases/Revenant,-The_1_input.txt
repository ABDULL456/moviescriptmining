HENRY Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger. 
BRIDGER But, Captain. 
HENRY Do it. 
Bridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over Glass' wide open eyes. And Glass must know what's happening, because his eyes roll up to Bridger's... his lips try to form a word... his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him. 
CUT TO: 
GLASS' POV - ON BRIDGER... 
...the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes... everything goes black. 
HENRY (O.S.) Step clear, Mr. Bridger. 
A LONG BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then... 
BACK TO SCENE 
Henry standing over Glass... pistol aimed down. His hand trembles slightly. 
Pig turns away... presses his hands over his ears. 
Bridger takes a few steps back... stares at Henry. 
Henry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms... because he's thought of something else. 
HENRY (CONT'D) There's a seventy dollar bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men that stay with Glass... see this through. Then give him a proper burial. 
BRIDGER I'll stay with him... money or not. 
PIG Same here. 
HENRY I can't let you stay back, Pig. Without Glass, I'll need you to scout. 
Henry looks to the others... they all drop their eyes... not interested. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Just need one more. 
FITZGERALD Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new setta ears. 
HENRY A hundred then. 
Still nothing from the others. 
BRIDGER They can have my share too. I owe Glass that at least. 
FITZGERALD That case I'll hang back with the kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or so behind for two hundred. 
HENRY But Glass is to be cared for until. Understood? 
FITZGERALD (motions to Bridger) I'll let the young doctor do his job. 
Henry hesitates... doesn't like this, but knows it's the best option left. 
HENRY The rest gather your gear. 
Bridger reaches down... lifts the rag from Glass' face. Their eyes meet... Bridger gives Glass a nod. 
EXT. CAMP - LATER 
Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave. Pig bends down over Glass. 
PIG I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh. 
Glass's glazed eyes focus on Pig. He moves the only thing he can... BLINKS a "yes" back at him. 
HENRY (to Fitzgerald and BRIDGER) As long as necessary. 
BRIDGER I'll look after him. 
Henry turns... leads the men into the trees... toward the Grand... toward Fort Union.

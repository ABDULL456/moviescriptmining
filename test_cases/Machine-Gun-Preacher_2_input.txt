... Sam and Deng crammed into this crowded bus... 
SAM They always drive this fast? 
DENG Traveling is the most dangerous time in Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad. 
An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to connect here, but Deng is reticent. 
SAM You got kids, Deng? 
DENG No. I have no children. 
SAM Where you from? 
DENG A little village called Aweil. Many hours from here. 
SAM That's where your family is? 
And Deng simply says... 
DENG My family was killed by LRA. (BEAT) Unyama is about two hours from here. We will stop there for lunch. 
Deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching the land blur past. And Sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling this man's need to be alone in the moment. A great, lost giant. 
EXT. UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY 
A dense sea of people. 20,000 displaced refugees living on top of each other. 
Life is lived out in the open here... women bent over brightly colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water... smoke from giant cooking pots drifting into the air... semi-clothed children, some with even younger children on their hips, running everywhere. The poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming. 
And we see Sam and Deng walking through the camp... 
DENG The Muslim North has tried to kill the Christian South for 30 years. Two million have lost their lives... 
Deng sweeping his hand, indicating the mass of refugees. 
DENG (CONT'D) ... these people have been driven from their villages, however these camps are not much better... 
EXT. MEDICAL AREA - UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY 
A row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area. Each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick. Battle-weary AID WORKERS move among them, doing what they can, caring for the ones who are most desperately ill. 
DENG Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough UN soldiers to protect everyone. Even here they worry the LRA will attack at night. 
And another SPLA soldier comes up to Deng -- 
SPLA SOLDIER 1 (ARABIC) Are you from Kitgum? 
DENG (ARABIC) Yes. 
SPLA SOLDIER 1 (ARABIC) Someone wants to speak with you. 
Deng turns to Sam... 
DENG I'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes. 
SAM Course, do what you gotta do. 
Deng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of humanity all around him. And suddenly there's COMMOTION! -- two aid workers coming into this tent carrying a WOMAN on a stretcher. One of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's -- her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without Borders. She sees Sam across the tent. 
AGNETE Excuse me. You. Can you help please? 
Sam moving to her -- 
AGNETE (CONT'D) We need to transfer her to the bed. Get her shoulders... 
Sam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid worker gets her feet... 
AGNETE (CONT'D) One, two, three... 
And they swing the woman over to a cot... but as they do the sheer piece of blood-stained muslin that was covering her face falls away... and we see that she has been mutilated... her lips cut off of her face... 
... and now a DOCTOR sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her. Sam and Agnete pushed back, away from the action. Sam still shocked by what he's seen. 
SAM What happened to her face? 
AGNETE The rebels cut off her lips because she argued. These are Kony's orders. 
SAM Who's Kony? 
Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam. 
AGNETE Who are you with? 
SAM I'm with Deng over there. 
AGNETE What organization are you with? 
SAM Working with a Christian group down South. Just up here takin a look around, seein a bit of the country. 
AGNETE This isn't a tourist destination, this is a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll be killed. (BEAT) Thank you for your help. 
And she walks off. 
EXT. NIMULE, SUDAN - DUSK 
Establishing a bustling trading center on the border of Uganda and Sudan. Noisy and overpopulated, a maze of concrete and tin buildings, hundreds of people on the streets, riding bicycles, finishing their business before nightfall. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT

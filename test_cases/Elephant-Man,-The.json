{"test1_input": "CARR How are you feeling today? \nMERRICK I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you? \nCARR I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis? \nMERRICK I feel much better. Thank you. \nCARR Are you comfortable here? \nMERRICK Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful. \nTREVES Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John? \nMERRICK Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to. \nCARR Oh yes? \nTREVES (after a pause) And what was that, John? \nMERRICK Potatoes... \nThere is another agonizing silence. \nTREVES (to Carr Gomm) ...Yes potatoes... but... \nMERRICK But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you. \nCARR (after a pause) I understand that you were beaten? \nMerrick is at a loss. This is not part of the expected scenario. \nDIERRICK Oh no, everyone has been very kind. \nCARR No, I meant in your former situation. \nMerrick doesn't seem to understand. \nMERRICK I'm feeling much better now... \nCarr Gomm stares levelly at Treves for a moment, then asks Merrick: \nCARR Tell me, how do you like Mr. Treves? As a teacher? \nTreves stiffens. \nMERRICK ...I... everyone has been very kind to me. \nCARR Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview? \nMerrick looks at Treves for guidance, but Treves cannot look him in the eye. \nMERRICK ...everyone has been very kind. \nCARR Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day. \nTREVES (to John) Thank you, John. You did very well. \nTreves and Carr Gomm go out the door onto the landing. Merrick sees his chance escaping him and tries to recapture their attention. \nMERRICK (his voice is gaining strength) The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures... (he continues through the following dialogue) \nTreves and Carr Gomm are alone on the landing, speaking quietly. \nCARR It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words. \nTREVES Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him. \nCARR I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day. \nMerrick has come to the end of what Treves taught him to say. He makes one last, desperate attempt to be heard. \nTreves, disheartened, stands on the landing as Carr Gomm starts down the stairs. \nMERRICK (V.O.) (now full voice) Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me... \nTreves is staring, open-mouthed, back into the room. Carr Gomm looks up at him. \nCARR What is it, Treves? \nMERRICK (V.O.) Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil... \nTREVES I didn't teach him that part! \nTreves rushes back into the room, followed by Carr Gomm. \nMERRICK My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. \nThere is a long silence as all three men stare at each other. \nTREVES How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it. \nCARR I don't understand. \nTREVES Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm? \n", "test1_true": "ISOLATION WARD \nA few minutes later. We hear voices inside the room. \nCARR (V.O.) It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick. \nMERRICK I am very pleased to meet you. \nCARR I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day. \nThe door opens and Carr Gomm and Treves come out. \nTREVES (to Merrick) I'll be right back. \nHe closes the door. \nCARR I want to see you in my office as soon as you're through up here. We've a good deal to discuss. \nHe starts down the stairs. \nTREVES Of course, sir. Thank you, thank you very much. \nCarr Gomm stops on the stairs. \nCARR Treves. Well done. \nTREVES Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness. \nISOLATION WARD \nMerrick is on the bed, propped up by pillows. The door opens. Treves comes in, shuts the door and leans against it. They look at each other for a moment. \nTREVES Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read? \nMERRICK You did not ask me. \nTREVES I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me? \nMERRICK Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me. \nTREVES We do have a lot to talk about, don't we? \nCARR GOMM'S OFFICE \nCarr Gomm is seated at the window, looking out silently. There is a knock at the door and Treves enters. He quietly closes the door and walks to the window. Carr Gomm never moves. \nCARR Can you imagine what his life has been like? \nTREVES Yes, I think I can. \nCARR No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can. \nCarr Gomm suddenly stands and faces Treves. \nCARR You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick. \nTREVES I could easily arrange... \nCARR No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick? \nTREVES Well, yes. \nCARR Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities. \nTREVES Do you think they'll go along with us? \nCARR Of course they will. They're reasonable men. \nISOLATION WARD \nMerrick is in bed, very tired. It's been an exhausting day. Suddenly the door opens and Mothershead comes into the room. Merrick looks up at her very apprehensively. She walks over to the bed, picks up the Bible from the table, opens it and hands it to Merrick. \nMOTHERSHEAD Read it. \nMerrick looks down at the Bible. \nMERRICK Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, At my cry. \nMothershead backs slowly to the door, deeply disturbed. She stares at Merrick for a moment. \nMOTHERSHEAD Credit where credit is due. You'll have the paper every morning at breakfast. \nShe quickly turns and exits. Merrick looks down at the Bible. It is open to \"Lamentations\". \nHALLWAY - THE LONDON (NIGHT) \nAs before the lights are going off in one hallway after another. The hallways are empty, dark and silent. We hear the great iron door close with a bang. \nISOLATION WARD (NIGHT) \nMerrick is in his bed as always. He holds the portrait of the beautiful woman, gazing at it longingly. He hears a door close far away in the silence of the hospital. \nSuddenly we hear the heavy footfalls of the Night Porter's boots. As they get louder and louder we move slowly closer to Merrick's face. \n", "test1_id": 3045, "test2_input": "Treves is standing in the street looking at the now bare shop front. He walks to the window and tries to clean a small circle in the glass. He peers in. \nFrom inside, through the smeared dirty window, we see Treves' distorted face. \nCARR (V.O. THROUGHOUT) I'd like to think I felt no less for John than you, Treves, but face the facts, the man has disappeared, very likely to the continent. There's no question of your going after him, you're desperately needed here by your patients. Remember Treves, you did everything in your power... everything in your power. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINSIDE A WAGON \nA moving circle of light in blackness. \nAs we move closer to the light, it becomes distinguishable as a peephole in the side of a wagon. Through the peephole we see a dark overcast sky. It is dusk. We move even closer to the hole. Just beside it we see the head of a horse with blinders on moving alongside. We move closer still to see its rider, a policeman. He notices the peephole and leans forward in the saddle, looking in. \nFrom outside, we see the peephole and an eye gazing out. The eye is replaced by a plug. \nThe policeman starts back and pulls up on the reins. As he falls behind we see the portrait of the E.M., from the front of the shop in London, on the back of the wagon. The policeman looks at the poster. The wagon moves on out of frame and the policeman slows his horse to a stop. \nThe wagon is being driven by Bytes. The boy sits beside him. Another policeman rides abreast of him. They ride a few yards more and then the policeman stops by a sign at the fork of the road, reading \"AALST 30 km\". \"Brussells 80 km.\" The policeman gestures for Bytes to move on. The wagon continues down the road. \nCUT TO: \nBytes and the boy are riding along the road. Bytes turns in his seat and opens a hatch in the roof. He looks down in. \nInside the wagon, lit by the last dregs of the sunset, is Merrick, huddled in his sleeping posture. He feels the light and looks up weakly, wheezing, obviously very sick. A small bowl of potatoes sets untouched beside him. \nBYTES Still haven't eaten, eh? \nMERRICK Bytes... please! \nBYTES Eat, my treasure, I want you healthy. \nHe snaps the hatch shut and turns forward muttering to himself. \nBYTES I'm beginning to feel your weight. \nFIELD & ROAD (MORNING) \nWe see a field with a road in the distance, leading to it. It is misty, the sun barely peeking through the rolling clouds above. On the road, the wagon is plodding toward us. At the bottom of the frame a FEMALE PINHEAD in a dress comes into view. She is watching the wagon. A DWARF comes into view beside her. She points to the wagon and she and the Dwarf excitedly confer. They turn back to watch its progress and the Dwarf reaches up and takes the Pinhead's hand. \nWe move back slowly to reveal a ring of circus wagons in the field. \nANOTHER DWARF comes up to the two other Freaks and watches the wagon. We pull back further to see a small circus. There are little stalls, and cages containing two mangey lions, some screeching spider monkeys and some squawking parrots. The circus is abustle in the drab grey field. \nCLOSE-UP of the Pinhead jumping up and down in her excitement. There is a clap of thunder. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA rainstorm over the freak show. We pass along the row of freak wagons. \nThese freaks truly deserve the name. They are quite different from the rather domestic ones we saw in the circus in England. These are not fakes. A rope cordons us off from them. \nThe audience, which we see all around us, is enjoying the freaks, but there is a sense of vulgarity in their gaiety. They seem hard, and cold and jaded. \nWe move by pinheads, a Hermaphrodite and a Legless Wonder. Some Siamese Twins are playing cat's cradle. Past them runs a Dwarf with a plumed hat playing a small flute. Trailing behind him on a string is a small wooden ark on wheels. \nA lionfaced man is combing the hair that covers his face. A Rubber Man pulls the skin of his neck up over his face. There is a fairly big crowd standing around a Tall Man, affectionately rubbing the Small Parasitic Twin, growing out of his chest. The Barker-Owners compete with each other and the occasional thunder. \nFinally we hear the patter of Bytes, telling of the horrible fate of John Merrick's Mother on that African Isle so many years ago. A very big crowd is listening to him. They are looking at the poster at the back of the wagon, waiting impatiently to see the Elephant Man. \nBYTES ...The result is plain to see. Ladies and Gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT MAN! \nHe raps twice with Merrick's silver-tipped walking stick and pulls the poster up. Merrick is standing unsteadily in the wagon. He is quite sick. The audience gasps and shudders. A few shrieks are heard. The Elephant Man is always the Elephant Man. \nBYTES Turn around! \nMerrick slowly turns around, the audience gasping at the sight of the horrible tumors. Bytes raps the walking stick twice. \nBYTES Dance! \nMerrick begins a series of awkward movements, his pained version of a dance. \nWithout his walking stick it is very difficult for him, but he strives to do it. Some of the crowd laughs at this, others shudder at the strange sight. \nSuddenly Merrick falters and comes to a stop, breathing irregularly. Seeing this, Bytes goes to him and bringing the stick behind Merrick, out of view of the audience, jabs him savagely in the back. \nBYTES Dance! \nMerrick groans with pain and some of the people in the first row flinch back. \nMerrick begins to dance again as people throw coins onto the stage, which the boy gathers and puts into a cap. \nFADE OUT: \nCUT TO: \nTHE BACK OF THE WAGON - DAY \nThe poster is rolled up, Merrick on the floor of the wagon wheezing horribly. \nBeside him on the floor is a bowl of what looks to be slop and potatoes. \nBytes is standing at the back of the wagon looking down at Merrick. He picks up the bowl and jabs it at Merrick. \nBYTES Eat, my treasure. \n", "test2_true": "BYTES (angry) Eat. I said eat! \nMerrick closes his eyes. This really enrages Bytes. \nBYTES Eat, damn you. EAT! EAT! \nHe jabs the bowl at Merrick, almost as if he'd shove it down his throat. \nBYTES I said EAT!! \nAt this last word he throws the contents of the bowl splattering in Merrick's face. He stands for a moment looking down at Merrick who has lapsed into a coughing fit. \nFADE OUT: \nCUT TO: \nSIDE OF THE WAGON - DAY \nThere is a small crowd gathered in a circle on the grass. Merrick stands amidst them on a small wooden stool, Bytes jabbing him from behind again. \nMerrick is making a strange moaning cry, slightly reminiscent of the trumpet of an elephant. The boy is passing amongst the people with a cap, collecting coins. Merrick lifts his face to the sky, the sound of his own misery mingling with his elephant call. \nFADE OUT: \nCUT TO: \nSMALL CIRCUS - NIGHT \nWe see the poster of the Elephant Man. Bytes stands before it saying the last of the patter. \nBYTES The result is plain to see. Ladies and gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT MAN. \nHe raps twice with the walking stick and pulls the poster up. \nMerrick is now extremely sick. He almost looks as if he is unable to stand. \nThe audience, as always, is quite alarmed. Bytes smiles and comes forward. \nBYTES Turn around! \nMerrick looks incapable of even this simple movement, but he slowly manages to turn. The crowd reacts to the horrible condition of Merrick's back and head. \nBytes satisfied that the Elephant Man is having the proper effect, raps the walking stick again. \nBYTES Dance! \nMerrick's eyes look painfully up to the heavens and he begins to shuffle clumsily about the platform. Without his stick this is very difficult for him, causing him great pain. It is a humiliating spectacle and the crowd unimpressed by the halting movements of the monster begins to heckle him. \nBytes seeing that the dancing isn't being received well moves to place a stool next to Merrick. \nBYTES (rapping) Up! Up! \nMerrick, already exhausted by his little dance, wheezes and coughs, attempting to ascend the stool. It is useless, he is just too tired. Again the audience shouts its disapproval, booing and hissing the Elephant Man. Bytes curses and raps again, demanding obedience from Merrick who again bravely tries to mount the stool. He cannot do it! \nBytes, striving to save the moment and please the angry crowd, goes to Merrick and roughly helps him up. Merrick teeters precariously on the stool. Bytes raps the stick. \nBYTES Give the call of the elephant! \nMerrick hesitates and Bytes bangs the stick on the wagon. The audience quiets down to hear the elephant call. Merrick senses this lull, but he is very frightened and sick. He lifts his head wearily and makes a few wavering cries that sound very little like an elephant. \nBYTES Louder! \nMerrick tries again but there is no improvement. The crowd begins to jeer at \nMerrick, exhorting him to make the call of the elephant. Merrick is now almost swaying on the stool. He attempts to step down, but as he does it finally becomes too much for him and he collapses into a heap on the wagon floor. The crowd is no longer in the least bit challenged by this piteous mess and they break out into a vocal fury, throwing objects at the wagon. \nBytes is humiliated at first, and then is quickly angry. He turns to Merrick. \nBYTES Get up you miserable bastard! \nBut Merrick just lays there moaning and wheezing irregularly. \nBYTES I SAID, GET UP! \nHe jabs Merrick a few times with the silver-tipped walking- stick. The crowd jeers even louder still. There is a clap of thunder. \nBYTES (realizing it's no use) I'm beatin' a dead horse. \nFADE OUT: \nCUT TO: \nSMALL CIRCLE OF WAGONS (NIGHT) \nBytes is seated by a campfire drinking from a bottle of wine. He is very drunk. From the wagon behind him we can hear Merrick coughing and wheezing. \nWe also hear the boy, almost pleading with Merrick to stop coughing and to try to eat. As Bytes listens he gets angrier and angrier. Finally he rises clumsily to his feet and stumbles over to the back of the wagon. \nBYTES Another bleedin' heart! \nThe boy is crouched over Merrick, who looks little better than a corpse. \nBytes points a menacing finger at Merrick. \n", "test2_id": 3046, "test3_input": "CONDUCTOR This is the end of the line, you'll have to leave now. \nMerrick pulls his walking stick from the darkness and plants it firmly on the floor with a loud THUD. The Conductor, expecting violence, draws back. A few people on the platform, who have stopped to watch this exchange, gasp. \nMerrick rises with the help of his stick, and slowly descends from the carriage watched very carefully by the others. He looks around for a moment, then walks off down the platform. TWO YOUNG TOUGHS follow a little distance behind him, laughing and mimicking his uneven gait. \nOOSTENDE QUAY (NIGHT) \nWe see a short line of people waiting to board a cross-channel steamer. The First-Mate is standing by the gangplank, smiling at the women passengers and making the most of his handsome face and crisp white uniform. He surveys the line, stops and smiles even more broadly. A very pretty Young Woman at the end of the line is smiling back. \nWe see the end of the quay disappearing into darkness towards the station. \nThe rhythmic sound of Merrick's stick is heard as he slowly moves into the light. \nThe Woman, still smiling at the First-Mate, demurely lowers her eyes. Merrick appears behind her, breathing heavily from the long walk. The woman's face freezes. She turns her head, ever so slightly, and sees Merrick. Her face drops. \nThe First-Mate sees the Woman change, then sees Merrick. He walks out of frame. Merrick is still trying to catch his breath as the First-Mate walks up. The Woman looks up at the First-Mate imploringly. \nFIRST-MATE May I see your ticket? \nMerrick, confused at first, produces his ticket from his cloak. The First-Mate examines it and hands it back. \nFIRST-MATE I'm sorry, there's no room for you on this ship, you'll have to wait for the next one, in the morning. \nMerrick remains motionless. \nFIRST-MATE You heard me. There's no room. Now be off with you. \nHe points down the quay. Merrick turns and walks away. The Woman smiles gratefully at the Fist-Mate, who tips his hat. \nA WAREHOUSE PIER \nTWO DRUNKS are sitting against the wall, drinking and singing. One of them gets up and walks out of frame. \nMerrick peeks around a corner at the Drunk. They stare at each other for a long moment. Merrick disappears. The other Drunk comes back, sits down, and they both start singing again. \nMerrick is in darkness, seated around the corner, tapping his left hand against his leg, keeping in time with the drunken music. \nOOSTENDE QUAY (MORNING) \nWe see Merrick behind some crates, watching the ship. On the wharf a different First-Mate waits until the last of the morning passengers board the ship. He then nods to the Ticket Taker and ascends the gangplank, nodding to a crew man. On board, everyone prepares to get underway. \nMerrick pitches forward from behind the crates, half running, half stumbling toward the Ticket Taker. The Ticket Taker, about to board the ship, drops the tickets on the ground and stoops to pick them up. As he collects the scattered tickets a hand comes into frame holding a ticket out to him. He reaches for it, and calls over his shoulder to the crewman at the plank. \nTICKET TAKER Wait! One more! \nHe turns back and finally takes a look at the late arrival. \nTICKET TAKER You'll have to hurr... \nHis mouth drops. Merrick hurries past him. The crewman now also sees the passenger as he begins his clumsy ascent of the gangplank. The shrill ship's whistle blows. \nON BOARD \nMerrick is crouched in a dark corner underneath a stairway, his head resting on the points of both knees, his arms clasped around them. He is asleep. A few drops of rain fall and hit his cap, then a few more and finally it begins to rain. He wakes up and looks around. He hears a voice. \nYOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) Look! It's Dover! \nThrough the stairs we see a young couple in the rain at the railing, arm in arm. The Young Woman points. The Young Man turns to her and smiles. \nYOUNG MAN Finally! Dover! \nThey laugh and hug each other and run inside out of the rain. Merrick's hand comes into the shot, grasping a stair and pulling himself up slowly. He rounds the stairs and walks onto the deck looking after the young couple. \nMerrick walks to the railing and leans over it, oblivious of the rain. We see the cliffs of Dover. \nDOCKSIDE - DOVER \nThe ship's gangplank leading down to a sea of umbrellas. Passengers one by one come down the plank and are swallowed by the crowd. On the dock amidst the umbrellas, we see Merrick. He looks around, then moves off into the crowd. The crowd moves past a sign saying, \"To The Trains\". \nLONDON TRAIN - INTERIOR \nThrough a rain-streaked window we see rolling green countryside. We pull back to see an Elderly Man in a heavy black overcoat with a wide-brimmed rain hat eating an apple. Beside him his wife knits. \nA few other people similarly clothed are sleeping. We PAN across them to see Merrick at the back of the car watching the Elderly Man eat. \nLONDON TRAIN - EXTERIOR \nThe last car speeds down the track and disappears. \nLIVERPOOL STREET STATION \nGrey light filters through the windows in the high canopy ceiling over the trains in the station. The platforms below fill with people as trains arrive and depart. We now see the station with its newsstands, sweetstalls, shoeshiners, and passengers moving to and fro, carrying luggage and looking for their train. \nA YOUNG BOY is seated on a pile of baggage looking very adult and bored. His MOTHER stands beside him, though we see only a portion of her billowy skirt. \nWe hear her voice in rapid conversation with another Woman. The Young Boy scans the crowd looking for excitement. He sees something. \nThe Elderly Man we saw on the train and his wife are moving past the barrier. \nThe Young Boy slowly pulls a peashooter from a pocket, puts a pea in his mouth, and raises the pipe to his lips. His Mother's hand shoots out and grabs it. \nMOTHER'S VOICE Little beast! I thought mummy told you not to bring that horrid thing. Can't you behave? \nShe continues her conversation. The Boy looks sour. Merrick is moving past the barrier. He stops to look around and plan his next move. The Boy sees him. He tugs on his Mother's skirt. \n", "test3_true": "MOTHER Do be quiet Little Jim. Can't you see Mummy is speaking? \nMerrick still looking around, suddenly turns in Little Jim's direction. He sees the Boy tugging at his Mother's skirt and pointing at him. \nHe turns and walks in the opposite direction along a wall stacked with trunks and luggage, trying as best as he can to blend in. Little Jim gets up and moves after him. \nMerrick continues along the wall. A few people give him a second look, but pass on. Little Jim comes up alongside him. \nLITTLE JIM Hey Mister, why is your head so big? \nMerrick turns and looks at Little Jim. He looks quickly around. We see, across the station, an open archway leading out into a street. Merrick moves away from Little Jim out of frame. Little Jim watches him go. \nLITTLE JIM Mister! \nTwo other BOYS join Little Jim. The three of them watch the escaping Merrick, then move off after him. Merrick is frantically trying to make it to the archway. The three boys appear behind him and call out. \nBOYS Mister! Mister! \nLITTLE JIM Why don't you answer me? \nOne of the boys reaches down and snatches the hem of Merrick's cloak. He lifts it, trying to catch a glimpse of the mysterious stranger. Merrick pulls away and tries to go faster. Relishing the hunt, the boys follow him, taunting him all the way. As they approach the arch, Little Jim, determined now, steps in front of him cutting him off. \nMerrick comes to an abrupt standstill, shrinking from the boy. Little Jim reaches up to the hood and grasps it firmly. \nLITTLE JIM Now I'll see you... \nHe lifts the hood and then staggers back onto the floor in a spasm of fear. \nHe lets out a shrill scream. Merrick turns wildly away, looking for another escape. Little Jim's Mother, hearing her son's cries, looks up immediately. \nShe sees Merrick and the howling boy in the middle of the station. \nMOTHER My son! My son! Help! \nMerrick, hearing this, looks in her direction and whirls away. He stumbles toward another archway exit. People, hearing the noise, watch him go. He knocks down a little girl in his flight and she, too, starts screaming. \nThrough the archway comes a bobby. Jim's Mother, now with her son, calls to him. \nMOTHER Stop that man! Stop that man! \nMerrick stops at the sight of the bobby. The bobby at the arch, now aware of the commotion, sees Merrick and walks quickly towards him. \nMerrick changes course, but, a group of men, alerted by Jim's mother's screams, move forward together, cutting him off. They yell at him angrily. \nOne of them darts toward him and grabs a hold of Merrick's hood. Merrick turns frantically away and as he does, the hood is pulled off him. The crowd shouts at him as he goes, following him in wary pursuit. He moves back past the children and Jim's Mother. They all scream and shield themselves from his approach. Another group of people move toward him blocking all escape. \nBehind him, he sees a door to a urinal. He moves through it followed by the crowd. We hear fearsome echoes inside. \nInside the urinal, the crowd presses Merrick toward a wall. They have become angry now. They shout and there is fear in their voices. They hem Merrick in. He looks around hoping for an opening. There is none. \nHe gives a strangled cry and collapses as the bobby pushes his way through the crowd. \nMerrick puts his good hand over his good ear trying to block out the screams of the crowd. \nMERRICK (quietly to himself) I am not an animal... I'm not... I'm not... I am a man. \nEXAMINING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL \nA small room off the Receiving Room. In the center of the room is a low sofa covered with deeply stained, shiny black leather. On it lies a man, groaning softly. Treves is helping a Dresser bandage the man's leg. \nMrs. Mothershead appears at the doorway. \nMOTHERSHEAD There's a policeman to see you, Sir. \nThe bobby from the Liverpool Street Station enters. \nBOBBY Are you Frederick Treves, sir? \nTREVES Yes... \nThe card changes hands. \nTHE URINAL \nTreves enters and pushes through the crowd. He sees Merrick in a heap on the floor. The SERGEANT gets up to meet him in the middle of the room, but Treves keeps walking toward Merrick. \nSERGEANT You know this man, sir? \nTREVES Yes, he's... my friend. \nTreves goes to Merrick who, just coming to, reaches out to him with his good hand. Treves pulls him up, his eyes brimming with tears. Merrick, too, is weeping. Treves embraces him. \nMERRICK Mr. Treves! Treves. \nTREVES John.... how can you ever forgive me? \nHALLWAY \nTreves, Carr Gomm and Mrs. Kendal are walking down a hallway engaged in conversation. \nKENDAL It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box. \nTREVES I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited. \n", "test3_id": 3047}

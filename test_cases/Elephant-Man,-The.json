{"train": "THE ELEPHANT MAN \nWritten by \nChristopher De Vore, Eric Bergren & David Lynch \nBased on \n\"The Elephant Man, A Study in Human Dignity\" \nby \nAshley Montagu \nBLACK \nFADE IN: ABSTRACT DREAM \nCLOSE-UP of a gold framed miniature portrait of JOHN MERRICK'S MOTHER (tune or melody over her picture, heartbeat), which DISSOLVES TO CLOSE-UP of real Mother smiling A shadow comes over her face. CLOSE-UP of elephant ears, trunks, faces moving. \nDark, heavy feet stomping elephant trumpet, rearing up. \nPowerful hit and the Mother falls. Darker. Trunk slides over Mother's face and breasts and stomach, leaving a moist trail. \nMOTHER\u0092S POV of elephant's mouth, eyes, skin. Mother's face twists and freezes in a blurred snap roll. \nBLACK again. Knock, knock sound. Curtain opens to horrified faces. \nCUT TO BLACK AND SILENCE \nCIRCUS \nFADE IN TO steam shooting out of a huge old half-rusted calliope. The music is very loud and raucous. Moving up and back we see the black awning entrance to the freak tent, where FREDERICK TREVES, Resident Surgeon and Lecturer on anatomy at the London Hospital, is standing with his back to us observing the posters of the freaks. \nComing along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is Treves' wife, ANNE, and their two DAUGHTERS. The shrill over- whelming music seems to engulf her. \nShe looks discomfited, vulnerable, and protective of her daughters. The girls, oblivious to any fear, are finishing their chocolate sweets. \nCLOSE-UP of Treves looking at a poster. \nHe hears: \n#1 DAUGHTER Poppa! \nTreves turns and looks down to a chocolate-covered face. He smiles at the children and Anne. \nAnne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them. The other daughter looks into the freak tent. \n#2 DAUGHTER Poppa... may we go in there? \nANNE Alright... Your turn. \nShe turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins cleaning her face. \nHer kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughter's face. Suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the distance. \n#2 DAUGHTER Oh,look M-ummy! Elephants! \nANNE Oh, elephants! We'll go see them. \nShe stands. \nANNE (to Treves) You won't be long? \nTREVES I'll join you shortly. \nShe takes the children off toward the elephants. \nTreves watches them go for a moment, then turns and we go with him into the dark freak tent. He pauses to pay admission at a small booth, then disappears within. \nDARKNESS. We hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant. \nTreves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of the tent. Off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully into it. The tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. People mill about through the weaving corridors. To Treves' right, he sees a sign reading, \"The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin,\" over a small, very dark corridor. \nTreves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows. \nThe corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient the spectator. \nTreves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the inner chamber. \nIn a roped-off space stands a small stage set at eve-level, with curtains on three sides. On the stage is a bell jar filled with grey-murky fluid lit from behind with casts an eerie glow in the chamber. Suspended in the fluid is the life-sized body of a baby-doll with the attached head of a large snake. At the join of head and body is a blob of unidentifiable organic matter. It is obviously phony, but the effect is still very disquieting. At the bottom of the jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of it. Behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious triptych, portraying Adam on one side, Eve on the other, and the tree flowering over the jar. \nTreves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. He studies the strange object with a critical eye. In the passage we hear movement, and an OLDER GENTLEMAN enters. He seems visibly impressed with \"The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin.\" \nOLDER MAN A wicked birth... \nAfter a moment, Treves quietly leaves the inner chamber. \nAs he pushes his way through the corridor, the noise grows and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds. He exits and hears a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve candles, mounted in a row on a ten-foot stand, are blown out by \"THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN.\" His BARKER steps up and talks to the people. \nBARKER Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are larger than this mammoth blacksmith's bellows. So great is his power of exhalation, rivaling even that of the Great North Wind, that he will now challenge two grown men to attempt to hold the bellows shut as he applies the mighty blast of his herculean breath! Are there any volunteers? \nA few people raise their hands. The Barker scans the crowd and then points over the heads of the volunteers to TWO MEN toward the back. \nBARKER Ah! I see two likely lads! Come forward! Come forward! Pit your strength against the Mighty Wind- Man! \nOWNER (to himself) ...Movin' again! \nHe shakes his head in disgust. \nNow at the canvas, Treves tries to lift the edge to get a peek inside the wagon, but the meaty hand of the Owner clamps down on his wrist. \nOWNER Have a care, guv'nor. \nThe two men look at each other for a solid moment. \nTREVES Forgive me... \nTreves backs away and returns his gaze to the painted canvas. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nOPERATING ROOM - THE LONDON HOSPITAL \nWe see a bellows pumping air into the open grate of a cast iron stove. We hear moaning in the background. The coals flare to a fierce glow. From the mouth of the stove protrude the handles of several cauterizing irons, their heads imbedded in the coals. Up above the irons, Treves stands by a waist- high operating table covered with black leather. His face is illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse. \nThe room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive overcast sky seen through two windows. There is also a large sink, a cupboard containing dressings, gags, manacles, emetics and other unattractive things, and two hard chairs. \nTWO STUDENTS and two other DOCTORS, MR. FOX and MR. HILL, are present. The two Students are pulling with constant pressure on a rope tied to the patient's leg. Treves and Mr. Fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine accident. There are gear-wheel marks getting progressively deeper as they near a great open gash. Mr. Hill places a cotton mask over the patient's nose and mouth and applies drops of chloroform. The patient struggles, but soon his moans subside and he is unconscious. \nTREVES How long has this man been here? \nFOX Three quarters of an hour. \nTREVES Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this. \nThe two medical Students come forward. They stare uneasily at the gaping wound, which bubbles each time the man takes an agonized breath. \nTreves and Fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as Hodges and Pierce look on. \nTREVES (off handedly) Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them. \nFOX What a mess. \nTreves now notices that the student's faces have gone a trifle ashen. \nTREVES What got you into medicine, Hodges? \nHODGES My father, sir. He's built quite a successful practice. I hope to take it over one day. \nTREVES Is that your case as well, Pierce? \nPIERCE Yes sir. Though of course I do have a great desire to help my fellowman. \nTreves smiles at them knowingly. \nTREVES Of course you do realize that medicine has changed quite a bit since your father's time. In those days we didn't even wash our coats. In fact, the sign of a truly accomplished surgeon-- was his black operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus that it could stand up by itself in the corner. I've still got mine upstairs... You don't mind blood, do you? \nHODGES & PIERCE Oh no, sir. (etc.) \nTREVES Good, that's one thing we've always plenty of. \nHALLWAY \nA hospital MESSENGER BOY, dressed in a blue uniform and a can is making his way down the hall. He stops and looks into an operating room much like the one we have just seen. \nInside, the room is empty. The Boy closes the door and continues on to another operating room. The Doctors move with great urgency around the operating table. Blood is draining down into a white porcelain bowl. A Woman can be heard moaning. The Boy looks carefully, but finally closes the door and continues on his way. \nTREVES' OPERATING ROOM \nThere is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing of the wound comes up obscuring part of Treves' face. The patient is being held down firmly by the other men. \nThe door opens and Treves looks up. The Boy pops his head in. \nBOY Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir. \nTREVES Yes? \nBOY I found it. \nTREVES (studying the Boy carefully) Did you see it? \nThe Boy shakes his head slowly, \"No.\" \nTREVES I'll be with you in a moment ... \nThe Boy closes the door. \nFOX (quietly) I say Freddie, what are you about? \nTREVES Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance. \nAERIAL SHOT from third floor of the London Hospital looking down on the hospital square. \nBelow, Treves is walking briskly across the square, through a gate and into the slums beyond. \nThe aerial shot is actually FOX'S POV, and now we see Fox filled with curiosity, watching the figure from a window. \nLooking down from above and to the side of him, we follow Treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a recent rain, covered with horse manure and filth of all sorts. The air is smoky from meat burning fires. \nRounding a corner, we see and approach the painted canvas sign of \"The Elephant Man\" covering the front of a small, dingy shop. The door of the shop is windowless and padlocked. Treves walks into the picture, studies the whole scene for a moment, goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked. \nThe Elephant Man completes his turn and comes to rest. \nWe see a CLOSE-UP of the Elephant Man looking at Treves. His face is utterly devoid, and incapable, of expression. \nWe see the Elephant Man's eyes. He closes them. \nOUTSIDE THE SHOP \nThe Owner is locking up. \nTreves, facing the street, drinks in the fresh air. He is trying to forget his shock, put everything into focus. \nHe looks at the garish portrait again. \nTreves produces his purse. \nThe Owner, smelling money, turns. \nTreves hands him several coins. \nTREVES So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...? \nOWNER Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there. \nTREVES I'll send a cab. Here is my card. \nTreves hands the Owner a card. The Owner, greasy and dirty, shakes Treves' hand and squeezes his arm. \nOWNER Now we got a deal... We understand each other... guv. We understand each other completely. \nThe Owner gives Treves the evil look of a conspirator. \nTreves walks off, disoriented. \nThe Owner reads the card and smiles at Treves walking away down the street. \nDISSOLVE TO OUTSIDE THE SHOP \nA CABMAN is knocking on the door of the shop, staring at the portrait. The door opens, revealing a figure in a floor-length black cloak. On his head is an extremely large hat, cut to the lines of a yachting cap. A grey-flannel curtain hangs from the bottom of the cap all the way around, hiding his face. \nThere is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes. On the figure's feet are large, bag-like slippers. The only part of the body seen at all is the left arm and hand, which protrudes from the cloak, holding a crude walking stick. \nThe figure seems to loathe being in the open. We can just barely see in the darkness within the Owner standing to one side of the door, obviously enjoying the surprise on the Cabman's face. The Owner steps abruptly into his view. \nOWNER Don't just stand there. Help him up. \nThe Cabman, does so, while a small, curious crowd forms. The Owner gives the Cabman the card. The Cabman jumps up onto the seat and off they go. \nTHE RECEIVING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL \nThe receiving room is a bare hall, painted stone color. It has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are made, and certificates and other papers are issued. It is a cold, harsh place. \nCABMAN Not at all, sir. My... pleasure. \nHe exits. \nTreves turns and sees the Matron, staring. \nTREVES I'll be in my rooms, Mothershead. I'm not to be disturbed. \nShe nods silently. Treves looks at the figure for a moment. \nTREVES Come with me, please. \nHe starts to go out of the room. The hooded figure just stands there, motionless. \nWe see the whole room, the people now silent. They all stare at the figure. \nNo one makes a move. \nMATRON You heard the doctor... Go on. \nTreves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands there a moment, then slowly shuffles after him. Mrs. Mothershead and the people in the room watch him go. When he is out of sight, they all begin to talk excitedly. \nMothershead stands fixed and watches too, ignoring the noisy room. \nTREVES' OFFICE \nThe door opens and Treves leads the hooded figure to a chair in front of his desk and helps him to sit down, furtively trying to look into the eye-slit of the mask. In the small room the smell of the Elephant Man is overwhelming. \nTreves goes to the window and opens it. He nervously tries to compose himself, then turns to the hooded figure. \nTREVES My name is Frederick Treves... I am a surgeon here at the London Hospital, and I lecture in anatomy at the Medical College... I would very much like to examine you. Would that be all right? \nThe figure in the chair is still. Treves is at a loss. His sense of discomfort is growing. He looks at the floor for a moment, then locks his eyes on the figure's left arm. \nTREVES Ah... yes. Um, first I would like to ask you a few questions, would that be all right? \nThe figure does nothing. Treves sits down at his desk and picks up a pencil. \nTREVES Good. Now, let's see. Your Owner... um, the man who... who looks after you tells me that you are English and your name is John Merrick. Is that correct? \nThe figure does nothing. \nTREVES Do you know where you were born? Where you come from? \nDISSOLVE TO LECTURE HALL - PATHOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON \nBRIGHT LIGHT \nAs we pull back and down in a slow spiral we see the light is coming through high windows. We now see several rows of distinguished doctors talking to each other in anticipation. As we continue to spiral down we see Treves before them at a podium. Behind him are two ASSISTANTS standing beside a curtained stall. Treves raps a pointer stick on the podium to bring the meeting to order. We move behind the stall as the Assistants part the curtains and we see the silhouette of the Elephant Man. The doctors talk among themselves quietly. \nTREVES He is English, he is twenty-one years of age and his name is John Merrick. Gentlemen, in the course of my profession I have come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease, as well as mutilations and contortions of the body, depending upon like causes; but, at no time have I met with such a dreaded or perverted version of a human being as this man. I wish to draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient. Note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull... and upper limb, which is totally useless. The alarming curvature of the spine... Turn him, please... the looseness of the skin, and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90% of the body. \nTreves' voice fades as we DISSOLVE TO the Doctors, who at first were rigid and flustered, and now bent forward, concentrating, obviously consumed with interest. \nSpiraling down again we see Treves finishing his lecture. \nTREVES ...And there is every indication that these afflictions have been in existence, and have progressed rapidly, since birth. The Patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis. As an interesting side-note, in spite of the afore-mentioned anomalies, the patient's genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected. \nTreves nods to the Assistants and they go to the Elephant Man. We see them in shadow untying the loose knot of the loin cloth. \nCLOSE-UP of the shadow of the head of the Elephant Man. It goes up for a breath. \nTREVES So then, gentlemen, owing to this series of deformities: The congenital exostoses of the skull; extensive papillomatous growths and large pendulous masses in connection with the skin; the great enlargement of the right upper limb, involving all the bones; the massive distortion of the head and the extensive areas covered by papillomatous growth, the patient has been called, \"The Elephant Man.\" \nTREVES OFFICE \nThe Elephant Man (hereafter the E.M.) wearing his cloak, is seated by the desk. Treves stands behind him, measuring his head with calipers. He removes the calipers and notes the span, then sets them on the desk. He places the hood over the E.M.'s head. Treves sits at his desk and makes some final notes. He becomes more absorbed in his notes than in the E.M. The E.M. makes an unintelligible sound. \nTREVES Hmm? \nThe E.M. is silent. Treves, only now realizing that the E.M. has said something, looks up at him. \nTREVES Hmm? \nThe E.M. is silent. Treves passes it off as a sigh and turns back to his work. \nTREVES It's been a long day for everyone. \nHe closes his notebook and rises. He remembers something. \nTREVES Oh, yes, you'll need a cab... (to the E.M.) Stay. \nHe exits. The E.M. is alone. He rises and shuffles slowly about, investigating the room. He goes to the desk and begins touching things, including the calipers. He notices the card Treves gave to the Owner tucked in the back pages. He pauses for a moment and then takes the card. His hand disappears into the cloak, and he moves back into the corner behind the stiff, black operating coat. \nTreves re-enters. \nTREVES Come with me. \nThe E.M. takes up his stick and follows Treves out. \nUPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THE LONDON HOSPITAL \nWe see Treves and Fox alone at a window. They are looking down on the hospital square Treves had previously crossed and see the E.M., lit by gaslight and moving to a waiting cab. \nFOX You never mentioned his mental state. \nTREVES He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot... (to himself) I pray God he's an idiot. \nThe E.M., as he is getting into the cab, stops, turns and looks to the upper stories of the hospital. Treves and Fox are joined by three laughing colleagues who clap Treves on the back. \nTHE FIRST Quite a coup, Freddie. You'll look splendid in the journal. \nTHE SECOND Where ever did you find that creature? \nFrom the upper story we watch the cab drive away. \nTHE THIRD (V.O.) It's a pity. \nFOX (V.O.) I pity the poor cab driver, myself. \nFrom outside the window we see Treves surrounded by his laughing friends. \nENTRY HALL - TREVES' HOME \nWe see a door. It opens and Treves walks in. He shuts the door, locks it, goes to a coat rack on the wall and hangs up his overcoat and hat. He notices his reflection in a mirror and examines himself wearily. Anne's smiling reflection appears beside his. \nANNE Did it go well, darling? \nTREVES Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed? \nANNE Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now? \nTREVES No, I think a whiskey. \nWe move past Anne's reflection to a CU of Treves. \nWHITECHAPEL - NIGHT \nWe now see a bunsen burner roar of flame reflected in Bytes' eyes. Pulling back we see Bytes, quite drunk, sitting, cooking sausages over the hot brick. \nHe takes another drink from his gin bottle. Up comes a wet belch and he takes another drink. \nThe E.M. is crouched against the wall with a bowl of potatoes and a cup of water in front of him. With his good hand, he is picking tiny pieces of potato and feeding himself. The eating is fairly loud and animal-like. The drinking is even worse. \nThe Boy is across the room asleep, wrapped in ragged little blankets. \nThe E.M. takes a drink of water, making a loud smacking, slurping sound. \nBytes looks up from his cooking with a smoldering look, just waiting for him to make the sound again. He does and Bytes takes his crop and violently jabs him. \nTREVES What are you doing down there? Come up John, come up on the bed. The cold floor is bad for you. I won't hurt you, come on now... \nHe helps Merrick up onto the bed and goes back to the table for the bowl. \nTREVES You must eat. We must keep your strength... \nHe has turned back to the bed, but Merrick has slipped to the floor again, still trying to hide himself in the corner. \nTREVES ...What on earth is the matter with you? \nHe puts the bowl down again and goes back to Merrick, who seems very upset at leaving his hiding place. \nTREVES Now please, John, you must do as I say. Come up from there. \nHe starts to help Merrick up, but Merrick just presses himself farther back in the corner, still babbling. There are two raps at the door. Treves goes to it and lets Mothershead in. \nMOTHERSHEAD Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten? \nTREVES Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning. \nThey both look at the bed. Merrick has almost disappeared under it. \nMOTHERSHEAD Won't come out, eh? \nTREVES No, he's very upset about something. \nMOTHERSHEAD Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it. \nShe goes to Merrick and takes hold of his left wrist. \nMOTHERSHEAD Alright, my son, none of this fuss. Come up from there, this instant. \nShe starts to force him up from the floor. Merrick is moaning now, still trying to get away. \nTREVES No! Don't pull at him like that. We don't want to frighten him more than he already is. \nBy this time Mothershead has almost got him back on the bed. \nMOTHERSHEAD Honestly, sir, you must be very firm with this sort. Otherwise they'd lay about on the floor gibbering all day long. All he understands is a good smack. \nThey help Merrick settle back on the pillow. Merrick is still making desperate, unintelligible sounds. \nTREVES He's had his share of \"smacks\", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man. \nMOTHERSHEAD Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir. \nShe exits. Treves shuts the door behind her and turns back to the bed. \nTREVES (to himself) What good am I to you...? \nHe goes to the bed and sits down in front of Merrick, angered by his own seeming uselessness in the situation. \nTREVES ...What is my purpose? ...It's so important that I understand you. I want to help you, I want to be your doctor... (directly to Merrick) but I can't help you unless you help me, unless I know what you are feeling. I believe there's something back there, there's something you want to say, but I've got to understand you. Do you understand me? \nMerrick hesitates, then starts babbling again. \nTREVES No! You are going to talk to me! We are going to show them! We're going to show them that you're not a wall. We are going to talk! Do you understand? Nod your head if you understand me! \nSlowly Merrick nods yes. \nTREVES You do understand me! You understand. Now you're going to say it. I've got to hear how you say things. Now, very slowly, say \"yes.\" \nTreves carefully mouths the word. \nTREVES \"Yes.\" \nMerrick is still hesitant, from years of fear, but his eyes betray a growing excitement. Slowly, he tries to talk, his voice a tremulous whisper. \nMERRICK Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess. \nTREVES (grabbing Merrick's arm) Yes John! \nThroughout their dialogue, Merrick is still very garbled, but he no longer babbles. He makes a great effort to speak slowly, to form words the way Treves forms them, to be understood. \nMERRICK ...Yyes \nTREVES Yyyess. \nMERRICK Yyess. \nTREVES That's much better. I could understand that \"yes\". \nMERRICK (pleased) Yes! \nTREVES Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? \nMERRICK Yes. \nTREVES Excellent! Now, say... \"Hello\" \nMERRICK Hello... \nTREVES My name is... \nMERRICK My... name is... \nHALLWAY - STAIRCASE - THE LONDON \nWe see Treves leave Carr Gomm's office and walk toward us to the stairwell. \nAs Treves begins down the stairs, he sees Bytes on the next landing coming up. \nBytes spots him and goes toward him. \nBYTES I want my man back. \nTREVES Just a moment, how did you get in here? \nBYTES Never mind that, I want my man! \nTREVES He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation. \nBYTES (shouting) DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain! \nTREVES You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what... \nBYTES Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal! \nTREVES I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that. \nBYTES He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood! \nTREVES All you do is profit from another man's misery! \nBYTES You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back. \nTREVES You don't own this man! \nBYTES I want him back! \nTREVES So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you! \nBYTES I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities! \nCARR (V.O.) Well, go to the authorities... \nNow we see Carr Gomm standing above them, at the top of the stairs. \nCARR By all means do so. In fact, I'll fetch them myself. I'm quite sure they'd be very interested in your story, as well as ours. \nLivid, Bytes looks from Carr Gomm to Treves, at a loss for words. \nTREVES Now I think we really do understand one another. \nBYTES (venomously) Right... Right. \nHe backs slowly down to the landing eyeing Treves and Carr Gomm. At the landing he casually turns and disappears down more stairs. Treves turns and gazes at Carr Gomm. \nCARR Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves. \nTREVES (gratefully) Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then? \nCARR Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon? \nTREVES (slightly taken aback) Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir. \nCARR Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance. \nTREVES ...Yes, Sir. \nThey part company. We follow Treves down the stairs. \nTREVES (muttering) Two o'clock? \nThen we follow Carr Gomm to his office door. He stops short. \nCARR (mumbling out loud) Elephant Man? I don't want to meet an Elephant Man. \nHALLWAYS - THE LONDON (NIGHT) \nAgain, the hospital is closing down for the night. Lights go off in each hallway. The staff is vacating the hospital. As the last light goes off, we hear the great iron door slam shut. \nTREVES' HOUSE - BEDROOM (NIGHT) \nAnne is at her dressing table, brushing out her hair. She is in a very flattering dressing gown, ready to turn in. We see her reflected in the mirror as well as Treves who is in his robe in the background seated at his side of their bed, deep in thought. Anne looks at Treves and smiles affectionately. \nANNE (coyly) Freddie? \nGetting no response she renews her efforts. \nANNE Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged. \nTREVES I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom. \nANNE What do you mean? \nTREVES Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me. \nANNE But I thought you said that he was rather... simple? \nTREVES He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself? \nThe sound is very close now, and Merrick's eyes are visibly agitated. \nFinally, the door bursts open and the Night Porter is standing there. He stares malevolently at Merrick for a long moment and then walks to him menacingly. \nNIGHT PORTER I hear you have some trouble sleepin'... \nHe grabs Merrick fiercely by the hair and jerks his head back. Merrick immediately starts to wheeze and gasp. \nNIGHT PORTER Head's too heavy, eh? \nHe pulls Merrick all the way down onto the bed, so that he is prone, struggling for breath. \nNIGHT PORTER And I heard a nasty rumor about you; I heard you can talk but you can't, can you... can you... can you?... \nMERRICK (struggling) Noooo! \nThe Night Porter is as first surprised, and then pleased at the desperate sound. \nNIGHT PORTER No... No you can't! One word about me out of that stinking cakehole... Just ONE word, and you'll have no trouble at sleepin'... no trouble at all. You understand me? Do you!! \nMERRICK (croaking) Yyyesss. \nSatisfied, the Night Porter rights Merrick who is just able to catch his breath. The Night Porter smiles and pats Merrick on the shoulder. \nNIGHT PORTER There now, that's better, i'n' it? \nHALLWAY \nTreves and Carr Gomm are on their way to the committee meeting, confident of their position. Treves is holding a folder, and Carr Gomm is looking at the photographs of Merrick. \nCARR As far as I can see, the only obstacle might be Broadneck. He has enormous influence over the others, very old school, not an easy man to impress. In any case, if worse does come to worse, we still have the British and Royal Homes to fall back on, don't we. \nTreves is silent. They stop. \nCARR Don't we? \nTREVES No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him. \nCARR Well, it's up to us then, isn't it? \nThey continue walking. \nCARR Don't worry Treves, we'll make them see it our way. \nHe looks at the pictures. \nCARR They've eyes, haven't they? \nThey go through a door marked \"Committee Room\". \nCOMMITTEE ROOM - THE LONDON HOSPITAL \nWe see a pair of hands. One of the photographs of Merrick is passed to them. \nThey hold it for a moment, then lay it down flat on the table. One of the hands covers the photograph with a piece of paper. \nTREVES (V.O.) ...Due to the progressive nature of the disease, I feel sure that the patient does not have much longer to live. \nWe pan up from the hands to see BROADNECK, his face pinched with disgust. He sniffs, and gazes coolly at Treves. \nTREVES Forgive the redundancy, gentlemen, but there is no other place for him. Both the Royal Hospital and the British Home have turned him down even if sufficient funds for his care were provided. The workhouse is certainly out of the question. The patient has an overwhelming fear of returning to the horrors of his past. His appearance is so disturbing that all shrink from him. He cannot, in justice to others, be put in the general ward of the workhouse. The police rightly prevent his being exhibited, and he is mobbed in the streets wherever he goes. What is to be done with him? \nBROADNECK I, for one, am sick and tired of this competitive freak-hunting by these overly ambitious young doctors, trying to make names for themselves. To parade then about in front of the pathological society is one thing, but to waste this committee's valuable time with requests for shelter for these abominations of nature is quite another. \nTREVES Gentlemen, John Merrick is not an animal, he is a man, fully aware of his condition. An intelligent, sensitive, literate man, with an intimate knowledge of the Bible. His horrible infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is, a man; and it would be criminal if we of the London Hospital, his final refuge, the last place on earth where this man can find peace, were to cast him out. \nCarr Gomm, from his chair on the committee, pounds his gavel. \nCARR Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion. There are two small rooms off Bedstead Square that are no longer in use and would be admirably suited to Mr. Merrick's needs. I also propose to write a letter to The Times, appealing to their readers for assistance. Knowing the generosity of the British public, I feel we would have little trouble in raising the funds for his maintenance. Indeed, this hospital's rules do preclude the admission of incurables, but if ever there was an exception to the rule, it is this patient. So therefore, I propose, if Mr. Treves is finished, that we put it to a vote. All those in favor of keeping Mr. Merrick here? \nCarr Gomm and another committee member raise their hands. Broadneck is displeased. \nBROADNECK One moment, (showing the picture of Merrick) as far as I'm concerned this creature has no business being in our hospital. I think Mr. Carr Gomm's letter would be an excellent idea, (to Carr Gomm) and when you appeal for funds, I think you should appeal for a more appropriate place for him as well. I agree the British public is generous, and I'm sure that somewhere the creature will find a happy and permanent home, but not here. \nOne of the committee members says \"I quite agree\". Carr Gomm scowls a bit. \nCARR I see. All, then, that move we keep Mr. Merrick here? \nCarr Gomm raises his hand. None of the others do. Treves and Carr Gomm exchange hopeless glances. Carr Gomm looks at the man who had originally raised his hand. He looks away, ashamed. \nCARR All those opposed? \nBroadneck and the rest raise their hands. \nCARR I see. \nBROADNECK (triumphantly) Well then. In the meantime, of course, he needn't be turned out. He may stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square until such time as more suitable arrangements can be made, thus freeing the Isolation Ward for more deserving patients. Well then, Mr. Chairman, if there is nothing further to discuss, I move that we adjourn this meeting and all go bout our normal business. \nCarr Gomm cannot conceal his contempt. \nCARR I second the motion gentlemen. This meeting is adjourned. \nThe others cough their agreement and hurriedly leave the room. Treves walks over to the committee table and takes the paper off the photograph. He stares sadly at Merrick's picture. \nCARR (V.O.) Somehow I don't think they quite understand. \nTREVES Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular. \nHe holds the book out to him. It's an \"Alice In Wonderland\". \nMERRICK (surprised) Thank you... so much... oh it's beautiful! \nHe lovingly feels the leather binding and looks at Treves with speechless gratitude. \nMerrick carefully opens the book to a colored frontpiece, the picture of Alice grown too large for a hallway, looking imploringly at the dwarfed White Rabbit. The caption reads \"...curiouser and curiouser\". He leafs through the pages looking at the other illustrations as Treves, delighted with the gift's effect, looks on. \nTREVES I came to tell you that I'll be here early tomorrow morning. We're moving you to your permanent home. I'm sure you'll be very happy there, John. So get a good night's rest, there'll be new people to meet tomorrow. Good night. \nTreves smiles broadly and exits. \nMERRICK (weakly) Good night. \nTreves' words have disturbed Merrick. He sinks into the pillows, the book before him. We see the picture of the Mock Turtle perched upon his rock, great tears rolling down his cow-like face, as Alice and the Gryphon look on with intense sympathy. Merrick looks up at his disguise hanging on the wall. \nTHE PEACOCK PUB - WHITECHAPEL \nThe Night Porter enters and saunters over to the noisy crowd. As they welcome him, he slaps down The Times on the bar counter for all to see. \nNIGHT PORTER Here... listen to this. This is a letter to THE London Times from the guvnor of the hospital. (starts to read) There is now in a little room off one of our attic wards a man named John Merrick, so dreadful a sight that he is unable even to come out by daylight to the garden. He has been called The Elephant Man on account of his terrible deformity... \nThe Night Porter has the undivided attention of the people in the pub. \nNIGHT PORTER ...His appearance is so terrible that woman and nervous persons fly in terror at the sight of him. (pauses) ...and guess who can get you tickets to see him? Your own Sunny Jim! \nYOUNG MAN IN CROWD Let's go see him, then! \nNIGHT PORTER Keep your shirts on. (shaking his finger at them) ...When the time is right. Right now he's in the attic but tomorrow they're movin' him into Bedstead Square, right into my lap... then... for the right price you'll see something you'll never see again in your life. \nHe lifts his glass to his lips. We move back to see Bytes' boys who, having heard the Night Porter's words, slips unnoticed from the pub. \nMERRICK (wheezing) Workhouse! \nHALLWAY - MOVING DAY \nMerrick, in his disguise, and Treves, one arm around him, are walking together. Merrick seems very uneasy. \nA Nurse, on duty early or late getting off, passes them. She stares at the hooded figure. They continue on in silence. \nBEDSTEAD SQUARE ROOM \nThe room is now spotless. It is furnished with a bed and the required pillows, a small table and chair by the window, now curtained. Adjoining this room is a smaller one which contains a bathtub. \nMerrick enters and looks around, confused. Treves stands in the doorway. \nMerrick turns to him. \nTREVES This is your new home, John. \nMerrick pulls off his hood. His eyes are bewildered. \nMERRICK This... is my new home? \nTREVES Yes. \nMERRICK (incredulous) The hospital? \nTREVES Of course! What did you think? \nMerrick's eyes glisten with held back tears. He lowers them. \nMERRICK (almost sobbing) How long will I stay here? \nTREVES I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think? \nMerrick inspects his new home. He seems pleased-by the bathtub, by the table, by the window to the outside world. \nMerrick pulls the curtain aside and opens the window. He looks out and then up with a small intake of breath. Before him, beyond the hospital fence, the spire of St. Phillips Cathedral stands resplendently in the morning light. \nMERRICK When I'm next moved may I go to a lighthouse?... or to a blind-asylum? \nHALLWAY \nWe see Carr Gomm walking to his office. He is met at the door by an anxious Treves. \nTREVES Has the response picked up? \nCARR Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time. \nTREVES But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen. \nCARR Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post. \nTREVES Please do. \nCarr Gomm goes back into his office and Treves walks off. \nMERRICK'S ROOM (A WHILE LATER) \nThere is no one in the room. The bathroom door opens and Nora and another nurse enter, carrying buckets which they set down by the hall door. They straighten up and lean back against it. \nMrs. Mothershead enters from the bathroom, speaking over her shoulder to Merrick. \nKITCHEN \nAnne is composing herself by busily fixing the tea and cakes. She stops for a moment, takes a breath, and then resumes her activity. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTreves and Merrick coming down the stairs. Merrick is calm now. They go into the sitting room, where Anne is just setting the tea tray out. Treves ushers Merrick to a highbacked sofa and sits him down. Merrick is very shy of Anne. \nTreves and Anne sit on the other side of the table. \nANNE Mr. Merrick, sugar? \nMERRICK Yes please, two. \nANNE One or two? \nMERRICK Two, please. \nAnne serves the tea. \nTREVES John loves the house. \nANNE Do you? \nMERRICK Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room. \nANNE Oh? \nTREVES Yes, we do have a lot of room. But you should see the place on weekends, when I see patients here. Sometimes there are so many, we have to set them down wherever we can. In fact, Mrs. Treves sometimes says that the only room she can call her own is the bedroom. \nTreves and Anne laugh good-naturedly. Merrick's face, as always, is quite blank. \nMERRICK (earnestly) Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed? \nTREVES That's a canopy, John. \nMERRICK Ohhh... \nTREVES How is your tea, John? \nMERRICK It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself. \nTREVES Not at all, John. \nMERRICK I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses? \nTREVES Oh yes. \nMERRICK Who are they of? \nTREVES Oh, our relatives... the children. \nMERRICK The children! May I see? \nTREVES Of course. \nTreves goes to the fireplace and takes down a few pictures. He hands a picture of the girls to Merrick. \nMERRICK (as if looking at an icon) The Children. Where are your children \nTREVES Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends. \nMERRICK (the word gives him pleasure) Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice. \nANNE And here is one of Frederick's mother. \nMERRICK How lovely. \nTREVES Yes. \nANNE And here are my mother and father. \nMERRICK They have noble faces. \nANNE (a cord is struck) I've always thought that myself. \nMERRICK Oh, yes. \nMerrick sets the picture down carefully. \nMERRICK (ever so timidly) Would you... would you like to see my mother? \nTREVES (startled) Your mother? \nMERRICK Here. \nHe reaches into his cloak and brings out the small portrait of the beautiful woman. Treves is absolutely amazed. Merrick gently hands the picture to Anne. \nANNE Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful. \nMERRICK She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her. \nANNE (visibly touched) Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment. \nMERRICK If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good. \nMERRICK Good morning. \nTREVES John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright? \nMerrick is a trifle apprehensive, but he agrees. Treves ushers MRS. KENDAL through the door. At the sight of her, Merrick's eyes go wide. \nTREVES John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick. \nKENDAL Good day, Mr. Merrick. \nMERRICK Good day...! \nKENDAL I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward. \nMERRICK Oh, no. \nKENDAL I knew you'd understand. Here. \nShe-hands Merrick a nicely framed picture of herself. Merrick is speechless, overjoyed by the gift. \nKENDAL I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone. \nMERRICK Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother. \nHe places it, with great care, next to his mother's portrait. \nKENDAL She's very pretty, your mother. \nMERRICK Yes. \nTreves smiles at them. \nMerrick is a trifle nervous but Mrs. Kendal smiles at him and he relaxes a little. \nMERRICK Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there? \nKENDAL Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there. \nMERRICK Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful? \nKENDAL You've never been? \nMERRICK Alas, no. \nKENDAL Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial. \nMERRICK Tell me about it, please! \nKENDAL It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance. \nMERRICK (the magic word) Romance! \nKENDAL That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you... \nShe produces a beautiful leather-bound volume of Shakespeare's works. Merrick takes it with reverence and begins to leaf through it. \nKENDAL Have you read it? \nMERRICK No, but I certainly shall. \nMerrick finds a place and begins to read. \nMERRICK Romeo and Juliet. I know of this... \"If I profane with my unworthiest hand, This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand, To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\" \nMerrick, embarrassed by these last words, starts to close the book. \nMrs. Kendal knows Juliet's lines by heart. She looks at Merrick for a moment, then replies tenderly. \nKENDAL Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss. \nMerrick pauses, looking at Kendal, then continues. \nMERRICK Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? \nKENDAL Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. \nMERRICK O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. \nThey both look at each other for a long, silent moment. Treves is touched and amazed. \nKENDAL Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all... \nMERRICK Oh no? \nKENDAL Oh no... no... you're a Romeo. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE PEACOCK - WHITECHAPEL \nPeople are happily drinking and singing and laughing. Bytes and the boy are keeping a watchful eye on the Night Porter, who is making a deal with a couple of men at a table. They hand over a few coins and follow the Night Porter out of the pub. Bytes finishes his beer and thumps the glass down on the bar. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve and he and the boy casually follow the other three men out. \nBytes and the boy stand by the pub door, watching the men cross the street and go to the back gate of the hospital which the Night Porter unlocks, and leaves unlocked, but closed, behind them. They walk into Bedstead Square, laughing quietly. \nBytes crosses the street and goes to the gate. He walks along the iron fence and watches the Night Porter and his \"customers\". He stops and waits to see where they go. \nMOTHERSHEAD If you ask me, sir, he's just being stared at all over again. \nMERRICK'S ROOM \nWe pan across Merrick's bookcase, now quite full, and we see a few titles: \"Moll Flanders\", \"Emma', \"Jane Eyre\", \"Pamela\", and then to Merrick. He and Treves are reading poetry together. \nMERRICK When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die? \nTREVES Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die. \nMerrick closes his book and sits silently for a moment. \nMERRICK Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time... \nTREVES Yes, John? \nMERRICK ...Can you cure me? \nTreves is taken aback. He considers, then says tentatively. \nTREVES No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you. \nMERRICK I thought as much. \nMerrick rises. Treves ponders over what Merrick has just said. He looks at Merrick and something very odd happens. Merrick is looking levelly at him. \nFor the first and only time, we see expression on his face. It is a calm, knowing look, almost a benign smile. At that very moment there is a bright flash of light behind Merrick's head, seemingly from the window. Treves blinks, unable to comprehend what has just happened. When he looks again, the moment has passed. Merrick, his back to Treves, moves to the bookcase to replace the volume. \nTREVES John...? \nThere's a knock at the door. \nMERRICK Come in. \nNora enters with a brown paper parcel tied with string. Merrick says nothing. \nTREVES Are you looking for me, Sister? \nNORA No sir, Mr. Merrick. (to Merrick) I have something for you. \nShe puts the parcel on the table and opens it. We see several squares of new cardboard, a cutting knife, a pastepot, and a few brushes and some paint. \nNORA I thought these things would be helpful with your cathedral. \nMerrick examines the materials with reverence, and thanks her profusely. \nTreves is moved and a little disconcerted. Merrick lays the things aside carefully and begins to pull the crude spires from the discarded box. Nora smiles at the busy Merrick and exits. \nTREVES The cathedral is coming along nicely. \nMERRICK (bending over the model) Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her! \nTreves notices to his dismay that the growths on Merrick's head are larger. \nHe finds it very difficult to disguise his concern. \nTREVES How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you? \nMERRICK Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you. \nTREVES Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have? \nMerrick is silent. He goes over to his cloak, reaches into it and pulls out a folded up advertisement. He hands it to Treves, who examines it closely. It is an advertisement for an-elegant gentleman's dressing bag, boasting ivory brushes, silver fittings and Moroccan silk lining. \nTREVES You want a dressing bag, John? \nMERRICK You don't think it's too gaudy, do you? \nHALLWAY \nMrs. Mothershead finds Treves walking slowly down the hall, looking at the ad. \nMOTHERSHEAD Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick. \nTREVES Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office. \nMOTHERSHEAD Yes sir. (seeing the ad) What's that? \nTREVES A dressing bag. \nMOTHERSHEAD Very smart indeed. \nTREVES Yes. John wants it. \nMOTHERSHEAD A dressing bag? \nTREVES You don't think it's too gaudy, do you. \nMOTHERSHEAD Well... \nTREVES John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree. \nHe walks off. \nMOTHERSHEAD A dressing bag? \nTreves sits and Carr Gomm takes his place at the head of the table and raps his gavel. \nCARR Gentlemen, I know we begin every meeting by reading the minutes, but in the interest of speed I think we should conclude a matter discussed previously, to wit, that of Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man... \nBroadneck explodes to his feet. Carr Gomm smiles at Treves, who looks quite grim. \nCARR Mr. Broadneck? \nBROADNECK Mr. Chairman! I was under the distinct impression that we had concluded discussion of this disagreeable matter. Had we not ascertained that an Elephant Man is not acceptable as a patient? Have we not, very generously, allowed the creature to use two of our rooms until such time as he could be properly disposed of? Have we not... \nCUT TO MERRICK'S ROOM \nMerrick is working on his cathedral, painting details with a very fine brush. \nAs he lifts the brush from the paint jar, a drop falls on the table. Merrick carefully lays down the brush and wipes up the spilled paint with a cloth. \nMERRICK I must be more careful! \nCUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM \nBROADNECK Which brings to mind my next point. The rules, gentlemen, the rules. In a society such as ours, it is of paramount importance that we not stray from the established order. Has that order not already been fearfully strained by allowing this... this... sideshow exhibit to take up residence, however temporary, in two very useful rooms, the purpose of which would be far better served in accommodating treatable patients, patients to whom this hospital was originally dedicated? I believe we have a duty... \nCarr Gomm still smiles. Treves is about to spring to Merrick's defense, but Carr Gomm catches his eyes and motions for him to remain silent. Treves is perplexed. Carr Gomm checks his pocket watch. \nCUT TO MERRICK'S ROOM \nMerrick as before, busily working away. We see a ladybug crawling slowly across the roof of the cathedral. Merrick notices it and watches for a moment, then reaches up and lays a finger alongside the bug. The bug crawls onto his finger and Merrick holds it closer to him. \nMERRICK ...Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home... it's cloudy out, I know, but remember; behind the clouds there is always the sun. \nCUT TO WHITECHAPEL ROAD \nWe see a Royal carriage glide to a stop in front of the hospital. A footman jumps down and opens the door. A very elegantly dressed woman begins to emerge. \nCUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM \nBroadneck is still talking. \nBROADNECK ...In light of these facts, our course is clear. The question is not whether to accept this creature as a patient, the question is when will those rooms be vacated for use by better qualified, more deserving cases? I move that this Elephant Man be removed from the premises immediately. We have a sacred duty to cure the sick, not care for circus animals. That is my last word on the subject. Mr. Chairman, shall we vote? \nBroadneck turns to Carr Gomm. Carr Gomm checks his watch and clears his throat. \nCARR GOMM I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your mind is fixed on this matter? \nBroadneck blusters with rage. \nBROADNECK Mr. Chairman! Don't you have ears? I am unalterably opposed to any... \nCarr Gomm smiles and again checks his watch. Treves is very nervous. \nCUT TO HALLWAY \nWe see two nurses, their backs to us, walking down the hall. They start to go in a doorway when they stop suddenly, very startled, and curtsey deeply. \nMothershead comes into the hall, also curtseying madly. She is followed by the elegantly dressed woman, who is followed in turn by two footmen. They walk regally down the hall. \nCUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM \nBROADNECK ...No, my mind is made up on this, and I am resolved to stand firm. You shall not sway me. May we now vote, Mr. Chairman, at long last? \nCarr Gomm checks his watch. The door to the room begins to open. He smiles. \nCARR Yes, I believe that time has come. \nThe two footmen enter the room. \n1ST FOOTMAN Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness Alexandra, Princess of Wales. \nThe elegantly dressed woman enters. Everyone rises. \nALIX Good morning, gentlemen. I hope I am not interrupting? \nCARR Indeed not, your Highness. Your presence is always greatly appreciated. We were just about to put the matter of Mr. Merrick to a vote. (he turns to the other committee members) The Princess is very interested in Mr. Merrick's fate. \nALIX Indeed I am sir, as is the Queen. I have a brief communication from her Highness which she has requested I read to you: To the Governing Committee, London Hospital. I would very much like to commend you for the charitable face you have shown Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man. It is laudable that you have provided one of England's most unfortunate sons with a safe and tranquil harbour, a home. For this immeasurable kindness, as well as the many other acts of mercy on behalf of the poor, of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me informed, I gratefully thank you. Signed Victoria, Empress of India, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. (looking straight at Broadneck) I am sure you gentlemen may be counted on to do the Christian thing. \nAlix seats herself. \nCARR Thank you very much, your Highness, you may be sure we shall. \nBroadneck seems very unnerved. \nCARR Well then, I move that Mr. John Merrick be admitted to the London Hospital on a permanent basis, on condition that the Hospital shall receive a yearly payment equal to the cost of occupying one bed, and that the funds for his care shall be clearly separate from hospital funds. All those in favor. \nCarr Gomm raises his hand. The other members, puzzled, look at Broadneck. \nQuite red in the face, Broadneck looks at Carr Gomm, then to Treves, then to the Princess. He seems to almost deflate, then slowly raises his hand. The other members, now thoroughly confused, raise their hands as well. Carr Gomm bangs his gavel, smiling broadly. Treves is almost beside himself with happiness, and the Princess is obviously very pleased. \nCARR The motion is carried. \nBroadneck, humiliated, cannot look at anyone. \nCARR Well, now we may go about our normal business. \nMERRICK'S ROOM \nNIGHT PORTER Curtain time!!! \nMerrick is frozen, caught. Seeing Merrick in his outfit, the Night Porter's jaw drops. They both stare at each other. The Night Porter begins to laugh hysterically. Merrick frantically begins to put away his dressing bag articles. When Merrick starts taking off his ring, the Night Porter comes over to him and grabs him by the cloak. \nNIGHT PORTER No, no! You look lovely. Don't change a thing, darling. You look like the bleedin' Prince of Wales. \nThe Night Porter drags him by the neck to the window. He throws the window open out in the square is the waiting audience. \nNIGHT PORTER My friends... The Elephant Man! \nHe strips off Merrick's cloak. The audience gasps. A few people who have been before laugh and clap. \nMAN (W/THE WHORES) (laughing and clapping) Horrible... I told you it was horrible... just horrible. \nHe starts kissing each whore. The crowd is mesmerized. Bytes moves in behind the Man with the Whores. \nBYTES (to Man) Perhaps the ladies would like a closer look? \nThe Man begins to laugh. The Whores laugh drunkenly and halfheartedly resist being taken in to see The Elephant Man. As they are pushed through the door, \nWHORES Come on Jack... No... No, don't. (laughter) Etc. \nThe Whores reluctantly enter the room. The Night Porter laughs at their discomfort. The Man notices all of Merrick's pictures of women. \nMAN 'Cor, he's a real ladies' man, come on... give the ladies' man a kiss. \nHe lets one of the whores go and grabs the other one from behind at the wrists. \nMAN Come on, you'll give him a kiss. \nWHORE (still laughing but a trifle scared) Come on, Jack. \nThe Night Porter has turned Merrick and is holding him for the approaching kiss. The crowd is egging them on. The man forces the Woman closer and closer and raises her arms to force her into an embrace. As Merrick and the Woman touch, being pressed together, the Woman begins to scream. The Night Porter, the Man and the crowd all laugh with glee. Merrick and the whore now have their faces pressed together. The Whore is screaming and Merrick is crying out and screaming too. \nMAN Here that's enough romance. Now into bed. \nMerrick and the Whore are pushed onto Merrick's bed. The Night Porter grabs the other Whore now. She begins screaming wildly. \nNIGHT PORTER A prince needs a harem! \nHe pushes the screaming Whore down onto Merrick. Her screaming face goes right into his. Merrick tries to move away and as he does his head goes too far back and his cried turn to horrible wheezing. \nNIGHT PORTER Mind his head... You'll kill him. \nThe crowd outside is trying to see in the window. Five or six more have gone into Merrick's room to see. All are laughing and screaming and trying to get a close look at The Elephant Man. \nNIGHT PORTER (yelling) Quiet down. Quiet down. You'll have the whole place down on us. \nBYTES (outside, yelling loudly) Bring him out then, so's we all can see him. \nMerrick recognizes his voice and looks frantically around for his former owner. The Night Porter pulls Merrick up by the window again. He then begins pushing the crowd out the door. \nNIGHT PORTER Everyone outside!!! \nSuddenly one of the crowd outside reaches up and grabs Merrick's good hand and pulls him half out the window. Others follow suit and haul him all the way through. The cathedral falls to the floor, breaking into several pieces. \nBecause of the horror of touching him, the crowd outside lets Merrick fall to the ground. \nThe Night Porter whirls around and sees that Merrick is gone. He pushes the rest of the people outside and quickly goes to Merrick, lifting him to his feet. \nUnseen by anyone, Bytes slips into Merrick's room. Merrick is now standing. \nThe crowd moves in. The Night Porter is enjoying the festivities, but looks around nervously for trouble. \nONE MAN Give 'im a drink. \nThe Man grabs Merrick and pours some gin into his mouth, then pushes him away. \nHe's caught by another man, fed liquor and pushed away. He's pushed now from person to person faster and faster. Finally Merrick falls to the ground, dizzy and a bottle of gin on Merrick's head. He coughs and moans through the wheezing. The crowd is now strangely silent circling The Elephant Man like a pack of dogs closing in on a terrified rabbit. Suddenly Merrick starts to wail. The crowd joins in and they hoist him above their heads, screaming with laughter, around and around, joining him all the while. \nNow we see a window reflecting the scene of terror. A curtain is pulled aside and we see through the reflection the face of the Young Porter, watching everything. \nNIGHT PORTER (V.O. THE REFLECTION) Here now... Here now... He's had enough... show's over! \nMerrick is lowered down into the crowd. it parts and the Night Porter emerges walking Merrick toward us to his room. \nNIGHT PORTER (to the crowd behind him) Meet you at the Peacock. \nONE OF THE CROWD Bring your friend. \nNIGHT PORTER (laughs drunkenly) He's had 'is fill for one night. \nThe crowd moves through the iron gate of Bedstead Square. In the background we see Bytes' boy sitting on top of a wagon. The Night Porter takes Merrick into his room and puts him on the bed. He drunkenly stumbles about trying to out the room in order. He places the smashed hulk of the cathedral back up on its table, inadvertently leaving the spire and a few columns on the floor. He picks the cloak up and replaces it on the peg. \nNIGHT PORTER (to Merrick) I did real well tonight. \nHe takes a purse full of coins out of his pocket. He removes one small coin and flips it on the floor in front of Merrick. \nNIGHT PORTER Here... buy yourself a sweet. \nThe Night Porter turns and leaves. \nMerrick, alone now, hears the Night Porter's echoing footsteps and the distant sound of the gate being closed. There is a long silence as Merrick collects himself. He then leans back into his pillows with a deep sigh. His eyes close. \nBYTES (V.O.) My treasure... \nTreves is standing in the street looking at the now bare shop front. He walks to the window and tries to clean a small circle in the glass. He peers in. \nFrom inside, through the smeared dirty window, we see Treves' distorted face. \nCARR (V.O. THROUGHOUT) I'd like to think I felt no less for John than you, Treves, but face the facts, the man has disappeared, very likely to the continent. There's no question of your going after him, you're desperately needed here by your patients. Remember Treves, you did everything in your power... everything in your power. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINSIDE A WAGON \nA moving circle of light in blackness. \nAs we move closer to the light, it becomes distinguishable as a peephole in the side of a wagon. Through the peephole we see a dark overcast sky. It is dusk. We move even closer to the hole. Just beside it we see the head of a horse with blinders on moving alongside. We move closer still to see its rider, a policeman. He notices the peephole and leans forward in the saddle, looking in. \nFrom outside, we see the peephole and an eye gazing out. The eye is replaced by a plug. \nThe policeman starts back and pulls up on the reins. As he falls behind we see the portrait of the E.M., from the front of the shop in London, on the back of the wagon. The policeman looks at the poster. The wagon moves on out of frame and the policeman slows his horse to a stop. \nThe wagon is being driven by Bytes. The boy sits beside him. Another policeman rides abreast of him. They ride a few yards more and then the policeman stops by a sign at the fork of the road, reading \"AALST 30 km\". \"Brussells 80 km.\" The policeman gestures for Bytes to move on. The wagon continues down the road. \nCUT TO: \nBytes and the boy are riding along the road. Bytes turns in his seat and opens a hatch in the roof. He looks down in. \nInside the wagon, lit by the last dregs of the sunset, is Merrick, huddled in his sleeping posture. He feels the light and looks up weakly, wheezing, obviously very sick. A small bowl of potatoes sets untouched beside him. \nBYTES Still haven't eaten, eh? \nMERRICK Bytes... please! \nBYTES Eat, my treasure, I want you healthy. \nHe snaps the hatch shut and turns forward muttering to himself. \nBYTES I'm beginning to feel your weight. \nFIELD & ROAD (MORNING) \nWe see a field with a road in the distance, leading to it. It is misty, the sun barely peeking through the rolling clouds above. On the road, the wagon is plodding toward us. At the bottom of the frame a FEMALE PINHEAD in a dress comes into view. She is watching the wagon. A DWARF comes into view beside her. She points to the wagon and she and the Dwarf excitedly confer. They turn back to watch its progress and the Dwarf reaches up and takes the Pinhead's hand. \nWe move back slowly to reveal a ring of circus wagons in the field. \nANOTHER DWARF comes up to the two other Freaks and watches the wagon. We pull back further to see a small circus. There are little stalls, and cages containing two mangey lions, some screeching spider monkeys and some squawking parrots. The circus is abustle in the drab grey field. \nCLOSE-UP of the Pinhead jumping up and down in her excitement. There is a clap of thunder. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA rainstorm over the freak show. We pass along the row of freak wagons. \nThese freaks truly deserve the name. They are quite different from the rather domestic ones we saw in the circus in England. These are not fakes. A rope cordons us off from them. \nThe audience, which we see all around us, is enjoying the freaks, but there is a sense of vulgarity in their gaiety. They seem hard, and cold and jaded. \nWe move by pinheads, a Hermaphrodite and a Legless Wonder. Some Siamese Twins are playing cat's cradle. Past them runs a Dwarf with a plumed hat playing a small flute. Trailing behind him on a string is a small wooden ark on wheels. \nA lionfaced man is combing the hair that covers his face. A Rubber Man pulls the skin of his neck up over his face. There is a fairly big crowd standing around a Tall Man, affectionately rubbing the Small Parasitic Twin, growing out of his chest. The Barker-Owners compete with each other and the occasional thunder. \nFinally we hear the patter of Bytes, telling of the horrible fate of John Merrick's Mother on that African Isle so many years ago. A very big crowd is listening to him. They are looking at the poster at the back of the wagon, waiting impatiently to see the Elephant Man. \nBYTES ...The result is plain to see. Ladies and Gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT MAN! \nHe raps twice with Merrick's silver-tipped walking stick and pulls the poster up. Merrick is standing unsteadily in the wagon. He is quite sick. The audience gasps and shudders. A few shrieks are heard. The Elephant Man is always the Elephant Man. \nBYTES Turn around! \nMerrick slowly turns around, the audience gasping at the sight of the horrible tumors. Bytes raps the walking stick twice. \nBYTES Dance! \nMerrick begins a series of awkward movements, his pained version of a dance. \nWithout his walking stick it is very difficult for him, but he strives to do it. Some of the crowd laughs at this, others shudder at the strange sight. \nSuddenly Merrick falters and comes to a stop, breathing irregularly. Seeing this, Bytes goes to him and bringing the stick behind Merrick, out of view of the audience, jabs him savagely in the back. \nBYTES Dance! \nMerrick groans with pain and some of the people in the first row flinch back. \nMerrick begins to dance again as people throw coins onto the stage, which the boy gathers and puts into a cap. \nFADE OUT: \nCUT TO: \nTHE BACK OF THE WAGON - DAY \nThe poster is rolled up, Merrick on the floor of the wagon wheezing horribly. \nBeside him on the floor is a bowl of what looks to be slop and potatoes. \nBytes is standing at the back of the wagon looking down at Merrick. He picks up the bowl and jabs it at Merrick. \nBYTES Eat, my treasure. \nBYTES You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you! \nBOY Aw, Bytes, he's sick. \nBYTES He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop! \nBOY He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die. \nBYTES (enraged) If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh. \nHe reaches in and grabs Merrick roughly by his arm, dragging him out of the wagon. \nBOY What are you going to do? \nBYTES I'll show you! I'll show you! \nHe drags Merrick across the way to a small monkey wagon. The boy follows, his face filled with sympathy for Merrick. Bytes opens the cage door and stuffs Merrick in as the monkeys scream. \nBOY Don't! \nBYTES Shut up! \nHe slams the door and latches it. Then he quickly turns, still in his rage, and starts for the wagon. As he passes the boy, the boy tries to stop him. \nBOY Bytes, please... \nBytes knocks the boy down with the back of his hand. He stalks to his wagon and climbs inside. After some muffled sound, Merrick's food bowl comes flying out. There are more muffled sounds as Merrick's stick, cloak and hood are also thrown out one by one. \nBYTES Out! \nThe boy looks to Merrick who is in a panic trying to keep himself away from the monkeys who scream loudly in all the excitement. We hear Bytes, cursing to himself, in the wagon. The boy, frightened, goes to the fire and pulls a blanket around him. \nMerrick crawls to one corner of the cage away from the screaming monkeys. \nSuddenly one of the braver ones leaps at Merrick with a scream, biting him on the arm, and moving quickly away. Merrick yelps with pain and struggles to move away. The other monkeys have gotten the idea now and they begin to move warily toward Merrick, screeching threateningly. Another leaps out and clings to Merrick's shoulder, biting and scratching furiously then he too jumps away. \nMerrick cries out. \nNow the monkeys are getting braver and more and more of them lash out at Merrick with their paws. They jump onto him with savage screams, biting him on the head and neck and shoulders. Merrick's eyes search for escape. The monkeys come on and on without a break, screaming madly all the while. \nWith his good hand Merrick begins to pull himself up with the aid of a bar. \nThe monkeys strive to pull him down. Merrick looks through the bars at the wagon and screams frantically. \nMERRICK Bytes! Bytes, please!! \nBut Bytes won't come. Something is happening inside Merrick. A wave of feeling is growing, coming from a place in him very deep down and far away. \nThis feeling seems to give him strength and he is able to pull himself all the way up in spite of the hairy moving mass that now seems to cling to every part of his body. \nThe feeling is surging up inside Merrick making his body shake uncontrollably as if he were a volcano about to erupt. The monkeys keep on biting and screeching, pulling at him. Suddenly a formidable cry rings out of Merrick's mouth, with a power and assurance we have never heard from him before. He whirls about and cries out again a shattering \"No\", the force of which scatters most of the monkeys away from him onto the cage floor, dumbfounded. \nMerrick grabs a monkey who has managed to hang and throws it into the group of monkeys on the floor. \nMERRICK NO! I AM NOT AN ELEPHANT! I AM NOT AN ANIMAL!! I AM A HUMAN BEING! I... AM... A MAN! I AM A MAN!! \nThe monkeys have been shocked into silence, pushed into the other end of the cage. Merrick, perhaps as surprised as the monkeys, rests against the bars of the cage. The monkeys make no move toward him. They sit across the cage from Merrick silently watching him with fear. \nFADE OUT: \nCUT TO: \nTHE SILENT FACES OF THE MONKEYS \nWe now see Merrick crouched in a corner of the cage in his sleeping position. \nWe see the monkeys again, and hear whispering in the still night. CU of merrick's head resting on his knees. The whispering continues and a shadow falls across Merrick. Merrick begins to stir, his head comes up, and he looks around. The whispering stops. \nWe pull back to see some of the freaks from the circus gathered around the monkey cage in a small group. They are: 2 pinheads (male and female), the dwarf we saw earlier with the plumed hat and the ark on a string, another male dwarf, a female midget, a lion-faced man, and an armless wonder. The female pinhead reaches into the cage and pats Merrick's head. \nPLUMED DWARF You alright? \nMERRICK y-y-yes-- \nPLUMED DWARF Want to come out? \nMERRICK You're English. \nPLUMED DWARF Of course! You want out? \nMERRICK Yes. \nPLUMED DWARF Won't be a moment. \nHe looks to the lion-faced man and speaks to him in a foreign tongue. The lion-faced man unlatches the cage door. Then, after further instruction, from the plumed dwarf, the freaks gently help Merrick out of the cage, closing the door behind him. The dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion-faced man and the armless wonder move to each side of Merrick. The lion-faced man pulls Merrick's right arm over his shoulder. Merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder. \nPLUMED DWARF We've decided... You've got to get away from here... \nHe and the other dwarf light two lanterns and they begin to move off. \nThe boy by the wagon has awakened. He sees the small caravan of freaks moving in the darkness, the light from the lanterns bobbing over the grass. His first instinct is to call for Bytes, which he almost does, but then he thinks better of it. He rises and goes to where Bytes threw Merrick's stick and disguise. \nHe nicks them up and goes to the small band of strangely shaped beings. They stop and watch him warily. \nBOY (handing over the things) Here... you'll need these. \nCONDUCTOR This is the end of the line, you'll have to leave now. \nMerrick pulls his walking stick from the darkness and plants it firmly on the floor with a loud THUD. The Conductor, expecting violence, draws back. A few people on the platform, who have stopped to watch this exchange, gasp. \nMerrick rises with the help of his stick, and slowly descends from the carriage watched very carefully by the others. He looks around for a moment, then walks off down the platform. TWO YOUNG TOUGHS follow a little distance behind him, laughing and mimicking his uneven gait. \nOOSTENDE QUAY (NIGHT) \nWe see a short line of people waiting to board a cross-channel steamer. The First-Mate is standing by the gangplank, smiling at the women passengers and making the most of his handsome face and crisp white uniform. He surveys the line, stops and smiles even more broadly. A very pretty Young Woman at the end of the line is smiling back. \nWe see the end of the quay disappearing into darkness towards the station. \nThe rhythmic sound of Merrick's stick is heard as he slowly moves into the light. \nThe Woman, still smiling at the First-Mate, demurely lowers her eyes. Merrick appears behind her, breathing heavily from the long walk. The woman's face freezes. She turns her head, ever so slightly, and sees Merrick. Her face drops. \nThe First-Mate sees the Woman change, then sees Merrick. He walks out of frame. Merrick is still trying to catch his breath as the First-Mate walks up. The Woman looks up at the First-Mate imploringly. \nFIRST-MATE May I see your ticket? \nMerrick, confused at first, produces his ticket from his cloak. The First-Mate examines it and hands it back. \nFIRST-MATE I'm sorry, there's no room for you on this ship, you'll have to wait for the next one, in the morning. \nMerrick remains motionless. \nFIRST-MATE You heard me. There's no room. Now be off with you. \nHe points down the quay. Merrick turns and walks away. The Woman smiles gratefully at the Fist-Mate, who tips his hat. \nA WAREHOUSE PIER \nTWO DRUNKS are sitting against the wall, drinking and singing. One of them gets up and walks out of frame. \nMerrick peeks around a corner at the Drunk. They stare at each other for a long moment. Merrick disappears. The other Drunk comes back, sits down, and they both start singing again. \nMerrick is in darkness, seated around the corner, tapping his left hand against his leg, keeping in time with the drunken music. \nOOSTENDE QUAY (MORNING) \nWe see Merrick behind some crates, watching the ship. On the wharf a different First-Mate waits until the last of the morning passengers board the ship. He then nods to the Ticket Taker and ascends the gangplank, nodding to a crew man. On board, everyone prepares to get underway. \nMerrick pitches forward from behind the crates, half running, half stumbling toward the Ticket Taker. The Ticket Taker, about to board the ship, drops the tickets on the ground and stoops to pick them up. As he collects the scattered tickets a hand comes into frame holding a ticket out to him. He reaches for it, and calls over his shoulder to the crewman at the plank. \nTICKET TAKER Wait! One more! \nHe turns back and finally takes a look at the late arrival. \nTICKET TAKER You'll have to hurr... \nHis mouth drops. Merrick hurries past him. The crewman now also sees the passenger as he begins his clumsy ascent of the gangplank. The shrill ship's whistle blows. \nON BOARD \nMerrick is crouched in a dark corner underneath a stairway, his head resting on the points of both knees, his arms clasped around them. He is asleep. A few drops of rain fall and hit his cap, then a few more and finally it begins to rain. He wakes up and looks around. He hears a voice. \nYOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) Look! It's Dover! \nThrough the stairs we see a young couple in the rain at the railing, arm in arm. The Young Woman points. The Young Man turns to her and smiles. \nYOUNG MAN Finally! Dover! \nThey laugh and hug each other and run inside out of the rain. Merrick's hand comes into the shot, grasping a stair and pulling himself up slowly. He rounds the stairs and walks onto the deck looking after the young couple. \nMerrick walks to the railing and leans over it, oblivious of the rain. We see the cliffs of Dover. \nDOCKSIDE - DOVER \nThe ship's gangplank leading down to a sea of umbrellas. Passengers one by one come down the plank and are swallowed by the crowd. On the dock amidst the umbrellas, we see Merrick. He looks around, then moves off into the crowd. The crowd moves past a sign saying, \"To The Trains\". \nLONDON TRAIN - INTERIOR \nThrough a rain-streaked window we see rolling green countryside. We pull back to see an Elderly Man in a heavy black overcoat with a wide-brimmed rain hat eating an apple. Beside him his wife knits. \nA few other people similarly clothed are sleeping. We PAN across them to see Merrick at the back of the car watching the Elderly Man eat. \nLONDON TRAIN - EXTERIOR \nThe last car speeds down the track and disappears. \nLIVERPOOL STREET STATION \nGrey light filters through the windows in the high canopy ceiling over the trains in the station. The platforms below fill with people as trains arrive and depart. We now see the station with its newsstands, sweetstalls, shoeshiners, and passengers moving to and fro, carrying luggage and looking for their train. \nA YOUNG BOY is seated on a pile of baggage looking very adult and bored. His MOTHER stands beside him, though we see only a portion of her billowy skirt. \nWe hear her voice in rapid conversation with another Woman. The Young Boy scans the crowd looking for excitement. He sees something. \nThe Elderly Man we saw on the train and his wife are moving past the barrier. \nThe Young Boy slowly pulls a peashooter from a pocket, puts a pea in his mouth, and raises the pipe to his lips. His Mother's hand shoots out and grabs it. \nMOTHER'S VOICE Little beast! I thought mummy told you not to bring that horrid thing. Can't you behave? \nShe continues her conversation. The Boy looks sour. Merrick is moving past the barrier. He stops to look around and plan his next move. The Boy sees him. He tugs on his Mother's skirt. \nKENDAL Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead. \nTREVES I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain. \nKENDAL How awful for John. \nTREVES And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain. \nKENDAL Is he... dying then? \nTREVES Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do. \nKENDAL Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite... \nTREVES (understandingly) Yes. \nMERRICK'S ROOM - MORNING \nMerrick stands before the row of smiling ladies on his wall. He surveys them lovingly for a long moment. He is holding in his hand a bundle of evening clothes, the handsome black bow tie lying on the new silk shirt. \nMERRICK You women are such strange and wonderful creatures... Alas, it seems to be my fate to fall in love with each and everyone of you. I especially wish you could all be with me tonight... I'm finally going to the theatre. \nHe stands for a moment, reluctant to leave their company. He goes to his bed placing the clothes upon it, and then to the cathedral. He compares it with St. Phillips outside. He picks up the main spire and gazes at it, but his mind is somewhere else. \nMERRICK ...The theatre... \nCUT TO: \nTHEATRE ROYAL - DRURY LANE \nWe see the whole theatre. It is very ornate. The orchestra is tuning up and the house is filled with elegant, well dressed, handsome people all happily chatting and calling to one another. We see young men and women flirting boldly and generally enjoying each other's company. In the Royal Box Mothershead and Nora in evening gowns sit up front relishing the spectacle. \nIn the back of the box John sits between Treves and the Princess. He is dressed in his evening clothes, his cloak tied over his shoulders like a cape, but he does not wear his hood. \nThe Princess is explaining to Merrick the workings of a pair of opera glasses. \nHe takes them and delightedly spies about the theatre. \nJohn is breathless as the house lights dim and the curtain rises. Enter chorus. \nCHORUS O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend The brightest heaven of invention, A kingdom for a stage, princes to act And monarchs to behold the swelling scene! Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels, Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all, The flat unraised spirits that have dar'd On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth So great an object: can this cockpit hold The vasty fields of Rance? Or may we cram Within this wooden O the very casques That did affright the air at Agincourt? O, pardon! since a crooked figure may Attest in little place a million; And let us, ciphers to this great account, On your imaginary forces work. \nFADE OUT: \nCUT TO: \nTreves smiling at John. He exchanges knowing smiles with the Princess. John watches with the unconstrained delight of a child; but his rapture is even more intense and solemn. His attitude is one of wonder and awe, and he often leans forward, panting in his excitement. To John the characters are not actors in make-up and costume, but real people. \nCUT TO: \nMrs. Kendal and an actor dressed as royalty doing the last scene of Henry the Fifth. \nK. HEN Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart? \nKATH Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England. \nK. HEN O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate? \nKATH Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is \"like me\". \nK. HEN An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel. \nKATH O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies. \nK. HEN What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits? \nKATH Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits. \nK. HEN I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say \"I love you\". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly. \nDuring the above, Merrick mouths the Kings lines. \nFADE OUT: \nCUT TO: \nThe Royal Box, the Princess and the two friends enjoying the show. \nCUT TO: \nTHE STAGE \nThe chorus steps out to give the epilogue. \nCHORUS Thus far, with rough and allunable pen, Our bending author hath pursued the story, In little room confining mighty men, Mangling by starts the full course of their glory. Small time, but in that small most greatly liv'd This star of England: Fortune made his sword; By which the world's best garden he achiev'd. \nDuring the above, the CAMERA moves in on John. \nAmidst great applause the curtain rings down. Through the curtain comes Mrs. Kendal to renewed applause. She motions the audience to quiet down. \nMRS. KENDAL Thank you for your warm greeting. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's performance was very special to me, because it was very special to someone else, a man who knows the theatre and loves the theatre, and yet tonight is the first time he's ever actually been here. I would like to dedicate... the whole company wishes to dedicate, from their hearts, tonight's performance to Mr. John Merrick, my dear friend. \nShe gestures toward the Royal Box. There is modest applause as the audience rises and turns toward it. Merrick cannot be seen in the shadows, and the crowd cranes their necks trying to get a glimpse of him. We hear whispers of \"Oh look! It's the Elephant Man! The Elephant Man!' run through the audience. Treves turns to John. \nTREVES Stand up, John. Let them see you. \n", "test1_input": "TREVES (gazing at him levelly) Everything will be seen to. \nMORNING - AERIAL SHOT LOOKING DOWN ON HOSPITAL SQUARE \nThrough a window we see Treves and the E.M. walking through a back gate and across the square. MR. CARR GOMM, Hospital Chairman, turns and moves away from the window. \nHALLWAY \nNURSE NORA IRELAND is pushing a cart filled of empty breakfast trays down the hall. She glances into the stairwell and sees Treves and the E.M. coming through the door. She continues on, startled by the sight of the mysterious hooded figure. At the end of the hall, she goes into the kitchen. \nSTAIRWAY \nTreves and the E.M. are laboriously climbing a flight of stairs. The E.M. is puffing and wheezing with the effort. Treves supports him under his right arm. \nKITCHEN \nNora enters with the cart and waits for it to be restocked. She leans out the door for another look, but the hall is empty. A Nurse ladles mush into bowls. \nThere is a lot of activity in the kitchen. Nora takes the cart stacked with full trays and pushes it out the door and down the hallway. \nHALLWAY \nTreves and the E.M. cross the hallway and head up a narrow stairway towards the attic. There is a sign reading \"Isolation\". \nCarr Gomm is leaning out the door to his office, unseen by Treves. He closes the door. \nGENERAL WARD - LONDON HOSPITAL - MORNING \nIt is a long, high ceilinged room with large windows along one wall. Beds run the length of both sides of the room. It is a woman's ward and nurses are serving the patients breakfast. Nora enters and nurses take trays from her cart. Nora's mind is on what she has just seen. We see Mothershead come in the door behind her. \nMOTHERSHEAD (startling Nora) Nora! Mind your duties... if you don't concentrate dear, you'll only make more work for the rest of us. Now, get about your business. (pauses, seeing Nora's collar) ...and do get your collar straight, dear. \nNORA (fumbling with her collar) I'm so sorry, Mrs. Mothershead. \nMOTHERSHEAD Do get on with it, Nora. \nMothershead walks on, as Nora now very flustered, picks up a tray. \nISOLATION WARD \nCU of a bottle of dark fluid and a bottle of light fluid. Treves mixes the two in a glass. We are in a small oddly shaped room off the attic ward. \nThere is one tiny barred window located high up on the far wall. There is also a bed, two hard chairs and a table. The E.M. is sitting on the bed in shadow and his disguise is now hanging from a peg on the wall beside him. He is still wheezing and appears to be very weak. Treves serves the mixture to the E.M., who sputters and gags on it, but manages to get it down. Treves goes to the table and puts the two bottles in his bag. He goes to the door and turns to the E.M. \nTREVES I don't know if you will understand this, but you will never go back to that man again. You're safe now. No one will ever harm you. Do you understand? \nThe two men just look at each other. \nKITCHEN - LONDON HOSPITAL \nTreves enters the kitchen and nicks up a bowl. A NURSE ladles some porridge for him. \nNURSE Breakfasting with the patients this morning, Mr. Treves? \nTREVES It's for a patient. \nTreves exits and the nurses admiringly watch him go. \nFIRST FLOOR LANDING AND HALLWAY \nTreves climbs the stairs onto the landing. Down the hall, Mr. Carr Gomm is walking toward his office. Treves tries not to be seen, but to no avail. \nCARR Mr. Treves, come over here a moment, won't you? \nTreves hesitates, trying to hide the bowl, but gives up and goes down the hall to meet Carr Gomm. \nCARR Good morning, Treves. \nTREVES Good morning, sir. \nCARR (seeing the bowl) You've acquired a taste for this? \nTREVES It's quite nutritious, sir. \nCARR Don't be mad. This muck can kill you. \nCarr Gomm calls a Nurse from a nearby ward over. It is Nora. He takes the bowl from Treves and hands it to her. \nCARR Take this up, to to the man in the isolation ward when you have a moment, won't you? \nNORA (apprehensively) Yes, sir. \nTREVES Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you. \nCARR Indeed! \nHe gestures toward his office door. As he and Treves enter the office, Nora looks apprehensively up the isolation ward stairs. \nMR. CARR GOMM'S OFFICE \nIt is a small, elegantly furnished room with a large window. The two men sit, Carr Gomm behind his desk and Treves in a leather chair. \nCARR A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious? \nTREVES No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten. \n", "test1_true": "TREVES Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking. \nCARR Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable? \nTREVES Yes sir. \nCARR What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point. \nTREVES Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional. \nCARR Oh, is he a friend of yours? \nTREVES No, more of an acquaintance. \nISOLATION WARD (A) AND STAIRWAY (B) CARR GOMM'S OFFICE (C) \n(A) The E.M. is asleep in his sleeping posture on the bed. \n(B) Nora, with the bowl, is climbing the stairs to the attic ward. She pauses in sight of the door and looks apprehensively at it. She begins to hum to give herself courage, and continues up the stairs. \n(A) The E.M. awakens, hears the footsteps, and now the humming, which grows in volume. He becomes fearful and reaches for his cloak. The humming stops. He freezes and listens. \n(C) Treves and Carr Gomm seated as before. \nCARR I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him. \nTREVES Yes sir, I'll look into that. (he rises) Would you like to meet him sir? \n(B) Nora stands outside the door, listening. She is barely breathing. \n(A) The E.M., still listening, slowly lets his hand drop away from the cloak. \n(B) Nora opens the door. \n(A) The E.M. grabs for the cloak as the door swings open flooding him with light. We see him for the first time in his entirety. CU of Nora screaming and dropping the tray. CU of the caught E.M. \n(C) The shrill scream is heard from upstairs. \nTREVES Excuse me, sir. \nTreves rushes out. Carr Gomm just sits for a moment, thinking. \nCARR The Elephant Man? \nISOLATION WARD LANDING \nTreves, rushing up the stairs, reaches the landing. Nora is at the railing, crying. The door is open, the breakfast tray littering the floor. The E.M. is on the bed trying to squeeze into the corner. Treves quickly closes the door and tries to comfort Nora. \nTREVES I'm sorry, my dear, I should have warned you. I'm so terribly sorry, please forgive me. There, you're alright now. Go downstairs and please ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up. Tell her to knock on the door and wait for me. Alright? \nNORA Yes Sir. I'm sorry, Sir. \nDrying her eyes, she goes downstairs. \nISOLATION WARD \nClosing the door, Treves steps over the spilt breakfast and goes to the E.M. \nTREVES I'm very sorry about that. Are you resting well? \nThe E.M. makes a garbled sound. \nTreves, alone with the E.M., once more finds himself becoming uncomfortable. \nTREVES Ah good. Well then... oh yes, we'll have to get you some more food. I'm sure you must be simply famished. Hmm? \nThe E.M. is silent. \nTREVES Of course you are. Now then, I think you'll be quite comfortable up here for awhile. I'll see to it you have everything you need, and, uh... yes. \nTreves puts out a comforting hand to the E.M. who flinches back. The two men just look at each other. \nGENERAL WARD \nSeveral Nurses are taking bath things off a cart. At the other end of the room, Mothershead is talking to a patient. Nora enters and walks over to Mothershead. They talk, and Mothershead exits. Nora joins the other nurses. \nOTHER NURSES Did you see him? \nNORA Yes. \nOTHER NURSES What's wrong with him? \nWe see Nora's face. She is silent. \nISOLATION WARD LANDING \nMothershead knocks on the door. Treves opens it, comes out onto the landing and closes the door. \nTREVES Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today? \nMOTHERSHEAD (suspiciously) Fine. \nTREVES Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance. \n", "test1_id": 3045, "test2_input": "MOTHERSHEAD I've heard. \nTREVES Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him... \nMOTHERSHEAD Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in? \nTREVES Yes... Yes, let's go in. \nTreves opens the door. \nISOLATION WARD \nMothershead goes right to the mess. \nTREVES (to the E.M., hereafter Merrick) I would like you to meet Mrs. Mothershead - Mrs. Mothershead, Mr. John Merrick. \nMerrick looks up to Mothershead, then averts his eyes. He looks back at her and sees she has no difficulty being in his presence. \nMOTHERSHEAD How do you do? \nISOLATION WARD LANDING \nAt the door of Merrick's attic room stand two buckets of very dirty water. We hear footsteps coming up stairs and see a young porter carrying two buckets of clean, steaming water. He puts them down, knocks on the door, and takes the dirty water downstairs. The door opens, Mrs. Mothershead picks up the steaming buckets and takes them inside, shutting the door. \nISOLATION WARD \nMerrick's seated in a tin bathtub trying to hide his nakedness. Mrs. Mothershead pours the water in. She scrubs his back with obvious distaste, but does her job. Months of filth and accumulated excrescence are turning the bath water a murky black. As Mothershead scrubs, Merrick slowly leans forward in the bath, closing his eyes, apparently oblivious to his surroundings. \nTreves sits beside him. \nTREVES The disease is shocking. \nMerrick's eyes flicker. \nTREVES I wonder how far it can go before it... \nMerrick flinches and pulls away. \nMOTHERSHEAD Sit still. Don't wiggle about like a pup. I won't stand for any foolishness. \nTreves leans forward and looks at Merrick. Merrick grows still, his eyes closed, apparently in a reverie. \nTREVES (V.O.) It's pretty certain that if he had the disease as a child, he was abandoned. But in that case, he'd have to have had care. The very fact that he's alive bears that out... (cut to Treves) But, where? \nMerrick is listening. \nMOTHERSHEAD The workhouse. \nTREVES Yes! The workhouse! \nAt this word, Merrick begins to babble wildly. Obviously alarmed, he thrashes about in the tub, spilling water onto the floor. Treves, alarmed now himself, attempts to calm Merrick, who, still babbling, tries to rise from the tub. \nMothershead clamps a hand on Merrick's left arm. At her touch, he is instantly subdued, at least physically. He sinks back into the tub and begins to weep. Treves and Mothershead are astounded by the tears rolling down Merrick's cheeks. They stand motionless looking down at the agonized, naked elephant man. \nTREVES (softly) The workhouse. \nFOLLOWING BUCKETS OF DIRTY WATER DOWN A HALLWAY BACK ENTRANCE - ALLEY \nThe young PORTER is exiting with great difficulty through a large iron door carrying the two buckets. He sets one of the buckets down, takes the other and splashes it out into the alley. Some thick sludge dribbles from the empty bucket. Unseen by him, the NIGHT PORTER is standing just to the side and he now comes forward. The young Porter seems nervous in his presence. \nThe Night Porter looks at his spattered shoes, then up to the Young Porter. \nNIGHT PORTER What's all this, then? \nYOUNG PORTER Mr. Treves is scrubbing his Elephant Man. \nNIGHT PORTER Elephant Man? \nYOUNG PORTER Yeah... I hear it's a real horror. Even made Mothershead scream. \nNIGHT PORTER Friend of the night, eh? The Elephant Man. I think I'll have me a look at that. \nSuddenly the Night Porter kicks the other bucket of filthy water violently, sending it splashing all over the young Porter. \nNIGHT PORTER Now, you need the scrubbing, ducks! \nHe lets his cigarette drop to the ground, then stamps and grinds it with his brass-heeled boot, all the while smiling. Then he turns on his heel and leaves. \nCUT TO: \nDark clouds rolling through an evening sky. \nATTIC WARD \nThrough the high barred window, we see the dark sky. The E.M. is on his bed in his sleeping posture. A dim gaslight burns in the room. \nCLOSE-UP of his head on the points of his knees. His breathing is more regular now. \nA GENERAL WARD \nLights are being turned off. \nANOTHER WARD \nLights go off. \n", "test2_true": "Large iron door is closed. \nHALLWAY \nHalf the lights go off. \nHALLWAY \nNurses leave for their quarters - half the lights go off. \nSECOND FLOOR HALLWAY \nWe hear the slow metallic footfalls of the Night Porter's boots. He appears and walks into a darkened women's ward. The women are all asleep. Some coughing fitfully, others moaning quietly. The Night Porter walks down the aisle between the beds. We see several of the sleeping women as he passes them. Finally, he comes to a young beautiful woman, her eyes wide open, watching him with intense fear. On either side of her are two very ancient women, snoring deeply. The young woman has her arms tied, suspended in traction above her. The Night Porter moves to her, his shadow engulfing her. \nShe starts to move, rattling the apparatus above her. The Porter puts a finger to his lips. \nNIGHT PORTER Hush, love, I told you before one word from me, they'll toss you back on the street, and then those pretty little arms of yours will never grow straight. Now close your eyes. \nShe turns her head away, closing her eyes. He moves in. \nCLOSE-UP of a gas light in a hallway. The leaping flame makes a low roar. \nCUT TO ANOTHER HALLWAY \nSomewhere a door is opened and the squeak sounds vaguely like the trumpeting of an elephant. We hear again the metallic footfalls of the Night Porter's boots, and he appears. He goes to the narrow stairway marked, \"Isolation\". \nHe stops and casually looks about. He takes a swig of his gin, then starts up the stairs. \nATTIC WARD \nMerrick as before the light is very dim. We hear the echoing footfalls of the Night Porter coming up the stairs. Merrick's head immediately comes up from his knees. As it does, a small object falls from where his head rested. \nHe picks it up and puts it in a pocket of his cloak. it is the portrait of the beautiful woman, which he saw in his dream. \nSuddenly the door swings open and the Night Porter, bottle in hand, is standing there. He walks into the room and sees Merrick's shape on the bed. \nNIGHT PORTER Here he is, the old fiend of the night, the terror of the London. Let's have a look at you. Let's see what makes 'em scream... \nHe turns up the light and sees Merrick clearly. The Night Porter jumps back, awe struck. \nNIGHT PORTER Cor Blimey! \nMerrick is trembling. The Night Porter, hardly able to believe his eyes, moves slowly toward Merrick. He is afraid but as he reaches the bed, Merrick flinches back. The Night Porter grins, his fear gone now. He is in control. \nNIGHT PORTER So this is the Elephant Man. I ain't never seen nothing like you before. What the bleedin' hell happened to you? \nMerrick cowers as far away from the Night Porter as possible. \nNIGHT PORTER Oh... dumb, eh? \nHe takes a big swallow of the gin and smiles. \nNIGHT PORTER Good. I likes people what can keep quiet. \nHe offers Merrick his bottle with a swift, almost jabbing motion. Merrick pulls away from him. \nNIGHT PORTER Like a drink? Go on... Go on have some. No? You should try being more sociable, mate. \nHe tentatively presses the bottom of the bottle up against the hanging growth on Merrick's chest. Encouraged, he touches him with his fingers. Merrick makes a small whimpering sound. \nNIGHT PORTER (grinning) You and I are going to be good friends, we are. And, I've got lots of friends who I know would like to meet you. And they will, mate... they will. \nHe moves to the door and turns. \nCLOSE-UP of Night Porter's face. \nNIGHT PORTER Welcome to the London. \nHe moves out the door and it closes. In the bed, Merrick looks at the door with terror as the heavy footfalls of the Night Porter recede down the stairs. \nWHITECHAPEL ROAD \nWe see a horse's head in CU, snorting steam into the chill morning air. The horse is harnessed to a milk wagon parked in front of the London. Through the open back of the wagon we see the MILKMAN, and past him Treves, walking towards us. \nMILKMAN Here early again, eh Mr. Treves? If you don't mind my saying so, sir, with your early habits, you'd 'a made a fine milkman. \nTREVES Good morning, Charley. I'll keep that in mind! \nTreves walks up the path into the hospital. \nHALLWAY (MORNING) \nTreves, carrying a bowl, crosses the upper hall and starts to the narrow stairway to the Isolation Ward. Over his shoulder we see him knock twice on the door. As the door swings open, the camera pushes past him and we see the room. The lamp is still burning, but Merrick is nowhere to be seen. Treves enters, looking about for him. \nTREVES Mr. Merrick? \nThere's movement in the corner beside the bed. Merrick rises slightly from the shadow. The light from the lamp hits his frightened eyes. \nTREVES ....Good morning... John. I've brought your breakfast. \nTreves is unsettled by the sight of Merrick cowering down on the floor. \nMerrick begins to babble. Treves enters the room, placing the bowl on the table and going to Merrick. \n", "test2_id": 3046, "test3_input": "CARR How are you feeling today? \nMERRICK I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you? \nCARR I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis? \nMERRICK I feel much better. Thank you. \nCARR Are you comfortable here? \nMERRICK Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful. \nTREVES Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John? \nMERRICK Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to. \nCARR Oh yes? \nTREVES (after a pause) And what was that, John? \nMERRICK Potatoes... \nThere is another agonizing silence. \nTREVES (to Carr Gomm) ...Yes potatoes... but... \nMERRICK But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you. \nCARR (after a pause) I understand that you were beaten? \nMerrick is at a loss. This is not part of the expected scenario. \nDIERRICK Oh no, everyone has been very kind. \nCARR No, I meant in your former situation. \nMerrick doesn't seem to understand. \nMERRICK I'm feeling much better now... \nCarr Gomm stares levelly at Treves for a moment, then asks Merrick: \nCARR Tell me, how do you like Mr. Treves? As a teacher? \nTreves stiffens. \nMERRICK ...I... everyone has been very kind to me. \nCARR Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview? \nMerrick looks at Treves for guidance, but Treves cannot look him in the eye. \nMERRICK ...everyone has been very kind. \nCARR Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day. \nTREVES (to John) Thank you, John. You did very well. \nTreves and Carr Gomm go out the door onto the landing. Merrick sees his chance escaping him and tries to recapture their attention. \nMERRICK (his voice is gaining strength) The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures... (he continues through the following dialogue) \nTreves and Carr Gomm are alone on the landing, speaking quietly. \nCARR It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words. \nTREVES Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him. \nCARR I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day. \nMerrick has come to the end of what Treves taught him to say. He makes one last, desperate attempt to be heard. \nTreves, disheartened, stands on the landing as Carr Gomm starts down the stairs. \nMERRICK (V.O.) (now full voice) Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me... \nTreves is staring, open-mouthed, back into the room. Carr Gomm looks up at him. \nCARR What is it, Treves? \nMERRICK (V.O.) Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil... \nTREVES I didn't teach him that part! \nTreves rushes back into the room, followed by Carr Gomm. \nMERRICK My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. \nThere is a long silence as all three men stare at each other. \nTREVES How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it. \nCARR I don't understand. \nTREVES Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm? \n", "test3_true": "ISOLATION WARD \nA few minutes later. We hear voices inside the room. \nCARR (V.O.) It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick. \nMERRICK I am very pleased to meet you. \nCARR I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day. \nThe door opens and Carr Gomm and Treves come out. \nTREVES (to Merrick) I'll be right back. \nHe closes the door. \nCARR I want to see you in my office as soon as you're through up here. We've a good deal to discuss. \nHe starts down the stairs. \nTREVES Of course, sir. Thank you, thank you very much. \nCarr Gomm stops on the stairs. \nCARR Treves. Well done. \nTREVES Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness. \nISOLATION WARD \nMerrick is on the bed, propped up by pillows. The door opens. Treves comes in, shuts the door and leans against it. They look at each other for a moment. \nTREVES Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read? \nMERRICK You did not ask me. \nTREVES I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me? \nMERRICK Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me. \nTREVES We do have a lot to talk about, don't we? \nCARR GOMM'S OFFICE \nCarr Gomm is seated at the window, looking out silently. There is a knock at the door and Treves enters. He quietly closes the door and walks to the window. Carr Gomm never moves. \nCARR Can you imagine what his life has been like? \nTREVES Yes, I think I can. \nCARR No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can. \nCarr Gomm suddenly stands and faces Treves. \nCARR You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick. \nTREVES I could easily arrange... \nCARR No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick? \nTREVES Well, yes. \nCARR Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities. \nTREVES Do you think they'll go along with us? \nCARR Of course they will. They're reasonable men. \nISOLATION WARD \nMerrick is in bed, very tired. It's been an exhausting day. Suddenly the door opens and Mothershead comes into the room. Merrick looks up at her very apprehensively. She walks over to the bed, picks up the Bible from the table, opens it and hands it to Merrick. \nMOTHERSHEAD Read it. \nMerrick looks down at the Bible. \nMERRICK Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, At my cry. \nMothershead backs slowly to the door, deeply disturbed. She stares at Merrick for a moment. \nMOTHERSHEAD Credit where credit is due. You'll have the paper every morning at breakfast. \nShe quickly turns and exits. Merrick looks down at the Bible. It is open to \"Lamentations\". \nHALLWAY - THE LONDON (NIGHT) \nAs before the lights are going off in one hallway after another. The hallways are empty, dark and silent. We hear the great iron door close with a bang. \nISOLATION WARD (NIGHT) \nMerrick is in his bed as always. He holds the portrait of the beautiful woman, gazing at it longingly. He hears a door close far away in the silence of the hospital. \nSuddenly we hear the heavy footfalls of the Night Porter's boots. As they get louder and louder we move slowly closer to Merrick's face. \n", "test3_id": 3047}

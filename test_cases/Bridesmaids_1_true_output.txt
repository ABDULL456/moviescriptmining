HELEN What are you talking about? The only reason you're even in this wedding is because you're the groom's sister. Weirdo. 
MEGAN I'd rather be the groom's sister than have cameltoe from my $600 pants. We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them. 
HELEN Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't the one who caused a huge scene at Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry. 
Everyone looks at Annie. 
LESLIE I hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a Trans Am just pulled over. The guy gets out of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at- shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts. 
TRANS AM MAN Hey it's pretty late. What are you ladies doing? Becca and Dana scramble into the woods. Leslie gets behind the car. 
ANNIE Just changing the tire. 
TRANS AM MAN You guys need some man hands for that? 
ANNIE Nope I think we got it. But thank you. He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other. 
TRANS AM MAN Look, if you guys get tired, I live right up that hill. You ladies can just leave your car here, come on up and let us all lay down together. He starts to walk toward them. The girls are scared. Annie gives Megan a look. Megan tries to distract him. 
MEGAN Hey! Are those snowflake rims? The guy looks at Megan. 
TRANS AM MAN Yeah, found âem in a junk yard. Restored âem myself. 
MEGAN I bet you got a formula 4OO under there? 
TRANS AM MAN Well, well. Someone knows her cars. 
MEGAN I'm in the Firebird club. 
TRANS AM MAN You don't say. I never met a lady in the FBC before. He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod. Annie rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it. 
MEGAN You ever make it up to the Trans Am Nationals in Dayton? Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They talk in a loud whisper. 
BECCA What's happening? What's happening? 
DANA I can hear animals. 
BECCA Be quiet! The guy is moving closer to Megan. 
MEGAN Remember Smokey and the Bandit? 
TRANS AM MAN It's my favorite movie. âGive me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it quick . I'm in a goddamn hurry.â He leans into her. 
MEGAN Why don't you show me what's under the hood? Back at Helen's car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie. 
LESLIE How's it comin'? 
ANNIE Almost there. The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking. He puts his hands on her ass. 
TRANS AM MAN You wanna get in the backseat? 
MEGAN Uh... He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her. 
MEGAN (CONT'D) Hey take it easy! 
HELEN (O.S.) Hey what about me? He turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by Helen. He falls. 
DANA Oh my God!! Annie is frantically releasing the jack. 
ANNIE OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan, Helen let's go! All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it. Annie is finishing. 
TRANS AM MAN Hey you! 
HELEN Annie get in! 
TRANS AM MAN I'm gonna get you bitches!! He is coming towards Annie! She turns towards him with the jack. 
ANNIE Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so far down your throat you will shit out...your fucking..face! 
TRANS AM MAN Whoa, whoa. Alright. Alright. I'm leaving. 
ANNIE Get out! 
TRANS AM MAN I am! I live up the hill though if you change your mind. Annie backs up and jumps in the car. Helen peels away. The girls drive away fast. 
CONTINUOUS The girls still driving. Megan's eating chips. 
LESLIE Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up against you. That was a pretty gutsy move.

BOB Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer. 
MARLIN Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you? 
BILL Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off. 
MARLIN They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you, insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!? 
BOB Hey, Marty. Calm down. 
MARLIN Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy! 
BOB 'Pony boy'? 
BILL You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny. 
TED Pity. 
MR. RAY [singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species that live in thesea.

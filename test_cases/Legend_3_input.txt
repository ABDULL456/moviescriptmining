Suddenly, with the pure clarity of a BELL CHIME, the presence of DAYLIGHT is detected. 
The reflected glow of the coming dawn tinges the ground and casts it luminence over Darkness and the goblins. 
DARKNESS (cont) (writhing): What is this light...? 
Beams of rising sunlight advance down the tree trunks. 
Darkness recoils, wrapping his flaming cloak about him. 
DARKNESS (cont): You killed the final unicorn.... Is this not true? 
Blix and Pox exchange guilty looks. 
BLIX: This is true.... 
POX: Undeniably t-t-true, Lord. 
Darkness is on to them. He points with the alicorn. 
DARKNESS: You lie! Here is dawn! 
POX: Well.... almost t-t-true.... ess-s-sentially true.... 
BLIX: That stallion is dead, dead as dreams, dead as legend.... 
DARKNESS: OUT WITH IT! 
Sunlight is half-way to the ground. Darkness shrinks, shrivelling like a dying ember. 
POX: But.... but.... the m-m-mare still lives... 
DARKNESS: If even one unicorn walks the earth, my power is not complete.... 
BLIX: Just a female.... She has no power... The ground grows very light. Darkness melts into the campfire. 
DARKNESS: Only the power of creation....? Get that female....! I command you.... In the name of Darkness.... 
Sunlight strikes the ground. Darkness is gone! His arm holding the alicorn aloft the fire is the last to disappear. 
Lili backs silently into the shadows surrrounding the Great Tree. 
49 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY 
Lili runs straight into a driving blizzard. A distant SOUND alerts her and she pauses to listen. 
It is Jack and the faeries, SINGING. Jack's voice carries above the others. 
JACK & THE FAERIES (os): When times are hard and things look bad, Don't feel blue and don't feel sad.... 
A look of astonished joy comes over Lili's face. As the SOUND of singing FADES, she runs towards it, calling eagerly. 
LILI: Jack....! Ja-aack! 
50 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY 
Jack and the faeries troop march through the blizzard, all SINGING merrily. 
JACK & THE FAERIES (singing): If your down, wearin' a frown, That's the time to dance like a clown! 
Jack hears something in the distance and stops to listen. 
LILI (very faint) (os): Ja-aack.... Ja-aack.... 
JACK (bewildered): Lili....? 
The SOUND of her distant call is erased by the howling storm. Jack sadly decides it was a trick of the wind and hurries to catch up with the others. 
51 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY 
Lili stops running. There is nothing but the wailing wind. 
LILI (softly): Jack....? Oh, Jack.... 
A solitary tear starts from her eyes, only to freeze on her cheek like a diamond beauty spot. 
LILI (cont): Please God.... help me! 
Lili drops sobbing to her knees. Through her grief, she sees the unicorn's track in the snow, each hoofprint gay with tiny blooming flowers. 
Her courage restored, Lili follows this meandering trail of burgeoning life through the forest. 
52 EXTERIOR ENTRANCE TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY 
Gumps leads the way a huge BOULDER lodged uner the roots of a giant tree. 
GUMP (proudly): Here's my home, Jack.... What d'you think of that for a front door? 
Jack thinks Gump is pulling his leg. 
JACK (in jest): Be some job in getting it open. 
GUMP: Think you so? 
Gump WHISTLES. Immediately, two eyes blink open on the front of the boulder, and he is seen to have facial features. 
BOULDER: Morning', Gump.... 
The Boulder stands on a pair of tiny legs and waddles forth from under the tree roots, REVEALING the entrance to a cavern. 
He promptly trips and rolls over and over in the snows, his tiny stone feet kicking wildly in the air. 
GUMP (bowing): After you, Jack....

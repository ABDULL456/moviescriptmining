HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on headset) Two... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT 
HIROKO blinks as the sweat drains into her eyes. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) One...mark! 
She stabs the drive switch. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE - NIGHT 
Smoothly maintained engineering comes to life.  The enormous yellow crane starts to move on it's track-rails. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT 
The control board monitor is suddenly awash with information and schematics... 
HIROKO Okay, I'm out of here! 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
PARSONS Blow those suckers, Driscoll! 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL 
DRISCOLL raises a black device shaped like a cylinder with a handgrip on the end.  Slots it into the mechanism beneath the flap and carefully turns it.  A tiny red LED comes on. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER MODULE 
Complex mechanical assemblies attach the module to it's supporting pier-platforms.  There are a number of LOUD BANGS, similar to car engines misfiring.  Explosive bolts release the tethers. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL 
DRISCOLL reports into his headset. 
DRISCOLL Bolts blown! 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT 
HIROKO runs back across the catwalk.  She might have missed the PREDATOR's damaged computer before, but she doesn't this time.  Her foot comes down on it and she slips.  The gun goes flying from her hand.  HIROKO watches in horror as it teeters on the catwalk's edge for a moment... 
HIROKO No! 
...Then goes over.  She drops to all fours and peers over the side. Luckily it's only fallen about four feet onto a dirty ledge.  She reaches out for it... 
INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB 
GUTTIEREZ pushes forward on the crawler's controls.  The head-up display projected on the cab windscreen changes from 'NEUTRAL' to 'DRIVE'. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT 
The two crawlers TEAR OUT of the auto-shop's opening doors, headlights blazing. 
INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT 
GUTTIEREZ braces himself as they speed on a collision course towards the ditched crawler they left outside auto-shop earlier. 
GUTTIEREZ Shit! 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT 
KER-SMASM!  GUTTIEREZ' crawler rams the other vehicle off the roadway and through the platform safety barrier.  It balances precariously for a second, until finally it's weight sends it plunging into the swamp in a CACOPHONY of STRESSED METAL and CRUMBLING CONCRETE. 
INT.  SECOND CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT 
MATT Yee-haa!  Demolition derby, baby! 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT 
Holding the cracked mask to his face, BROKEN TUSK looks up at the gigantic crane moving against the night sky. 
PREDATOR VISION. Although the helmet's nightsight is malfunctioning, it's still good enough to register the 'hot' infra-red shape of HIROKO on the catwalk. 
The sound of the two crawlers hurtling across the platform gets BROKEN TUSK's attention. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT 
HIROKO gets a firm grasp on one of the railing rungs, anchoring herself. Stretches for the pistol with renewed determination.  She brushes the barrel. Not good enough.  Tries again.  Success!  Her fingers curl around the weapon, and she tugs it upwards. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

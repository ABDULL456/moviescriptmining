FORD You will accept a note? 
FREEMAN As always, from you, Mr. Ford. Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be separated from her family. She begs of Ford: 
(CONTINUED) 
59 CONTINUED: 59 
ELIZA Please, sir... Please don't divide my family. Don't take me unless you take my children as well. 
FREEMAN Eliza, quiet! 
ELIZA You will have the most faithful slave in me, sir. The most faithful slave that has ever lived, but I beg that you do not separate us. A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall- 
BUYER Your price for the child? 
FREEMAN You see how fit the boy is. Like ripe fruit. He will grow into a fine beast. Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting his activity and his condition. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Six hundred, and that's fair and final. 
BUYER Done. He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet, counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the already extended hand of Freeman. Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her. 
FORD How much for the little girl? You have no need for her. One so young will bring you no profit. 
FREEMAN I will not sell the girl. There's heaps 'n piles of money to be made off her. She is a beauty. One of the regular bloods. None of your thick-lipped, bullet headed, cotton picking niggers.

39A. 
59 CONTINUED: (2) 59 
FORD Her child, man. For God's sake, are you not sentimental in the least? 
FREEMAN My sentimentality stretches the length of a coin. Do you want the lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on them all? 
FORD I will take the ones Platt and Eliza. Eliza grips her children tight. 
ELIZA I will not go without my children. You will not take them from me. 
(CONTINUED) 
59 CONTINUED: (3) 59 As if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza and harshly kicks her away from Emily. 
ELIZA (CONT'D) Please, don't. No! Freeman, to Cape: 
FREEMAN Take her out of here. Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE, begins to pull Eliza away toward the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do not abate. IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Keep her quiet. Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza continues to scream for her children as Emily does for her mother. 
EMILY Mama... Mama! 
FREEMAN 
(TO SOLOMON) Play something! Get the fiddle and play. As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to play lightly. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Play! Solomon plays harder and more loudly. Still, it is barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries. Freeman gets the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing. Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring to be strong- 
EMILY Don't cry, Mama. I will be a good girl. Don't cry. I will keep my head up and I will look smart. I will always look smart. 
FREEMAN Make merry, all of you! Goddamn it, Cape! Keep her quiet or it's your damned hide I will take it out of! Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth. Clamping both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room by the head. IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE. 
40A. 
60 EXT. FORD PLANTATION - LATER 60 
Driven in a horse drawn wagon by Ford are Solomon and Eliza. Eliza is sullen to say the least. With the loss of her two children she has dropped into a depression she will not be able to pull out of. 
(CONTINUED) 
60 CONTINUED: 60 They arrive to the FORD PLANTATION. The main house of the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly called - is sizable. Two stories high with a piazza in front. In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry house, corncribs and several slave cabins. The plantation is described as "a green spot in the wilderness." With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of activity - the "excitement" of a new delivery. MR. CHAPIN, a white overseer, instructs a slave named SAM. 
CHAPIN Sam, call to the Mistress. 
SAM Mistress! Mistress, they arrivn'. MISTRESS FORD EXITS the house - along with her attending slave, RACHEL, who is a cook AS WELL AS SAM'S WIFE - and travels to her husband, kisses him, then laughingly

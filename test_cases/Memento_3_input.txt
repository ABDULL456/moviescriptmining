NATALIE 
He'll probably find you. 
LEONARD Me? Why would he be interested in me? 
NATALIE I told him about your car. 
LEONARD Why would you do that? 
NATALIE He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something! 
Leonard hands Natalie the piece of paper and pen. 
LEONARD Just write it all down. What he looks			  * like, where I find him.						 * (CONTINUED)

Natalie hands him a note. It says:

120  CONTINUED: (4)							  120 
"DODD MOUNTCREST INN ON 5TH ST., ROOM 6"				    * 
"PUT HIM ON TO TEDDY OR JUST GET RID OF HIM FOR NATALIE" 
Outside, a CAR ALARM starts to sound. Leonard gets up and heads to the door, flipping through his Polaroids. 
121  EXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - DAY <>			121 
The Jaguar's CAR ALARM is sounding. 
Leonard exits Natalie's house, walks to his Jaguar and gets in, silencing the alarm. 
TEDDY (O.S.) You should lock a car as nice as this. 
Leonard, startled, GRABS Teddy by the throat. 
CUT TO: 
122  INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE##	   122 
Leonard, in boxers, bandage on arm, sits on the edge of	    * the bed talking on the phone. 
LEONARD No, she shouldn't have given me that responsibility. Shit, I'm not a doctor, I'm a claims investigator. 
Leonard crooks his neck to hold the receiver between ear and shoulder and FIDDLES with the BANDAGE ON HIS LEFT ARM,		* starting to peel back the tape, t.zying to look under the cotton pad. 
LEONARD (cont'd) I suppose, but I've got all sorts of other considerations. 
Leonard starts to REMOVE THE BANDAGE. 
LEONARD (cont'd) Legal responsibility, and large financial... 
LEONARD REMOVES THE BANDAGE FROM HIS LEFT ARM, REVEALING A	 * CRUDE TATTOO WHICH SAYS: 
"NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE" 
Leonard looks up.

LEONARD (cont'd) Who is this? 
He takes the receiver away from his ear as if the caller has just hung up. 
CUT TO: 
123  INT. NATALIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY <>	    123 
Leonard is sitting on the coffee table, relaxed, looking at his Polaroids. Natalie (WITHOUT BRUISES) BURSTS in through the front door, scared. 
LEONARD What's wrong? 
NATALIE Somebody's come. Already. 
LEONARD Who? 
NATALIE Calls himself Dodd. 
LEONARD What does he want? 
NATALIE Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it. 
LEONARD Did you? 
NATALIE No! 
LEONARD What's this all about? 
Natalie looks at him bitterly. 
NATALIE You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you? 
LEONARD I have this condition - 
(CONTINUED) 
123  CONTINUED:							 123 
NATALIE I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!

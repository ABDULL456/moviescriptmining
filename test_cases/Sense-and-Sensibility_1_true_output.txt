SIR JOHN Decent shot--and there is not a bolder rider in all England. 
MARIANNE But what is he like? 
SIR JOHN Like? 
MARIANNE What are his tastes? His passions? His pursuits? 
SIR JOHN (mystified) Well, he has the nicest little bitch of a pointer--was she out with him yesterday? 
MARIANNE gives up. MRS DASHWOOD takes over. 
MRS DASHWOOD Where is Allenham, Sir John? 
SIR JOHN Nice little estate three miles east. He is to inherit it from an elderly relative--Lady Allen is her name. 
Now they are getting somewhere. MARIANNE is about to ask another question when they hear a horse galloping up. Everyone is electrified. MARGARET runs to the window and turns back in disappointment. 
MARGARET It is Colonel Brandon. I shall go outside and keep watch. 
MARGARET runs out of the room. 
SIR JOHN You are all on the lookout for Willoughby, eh? Dear me, poor Brandon. You will none of you think of him now. 
BRANDON is admitted by BETSY. He is carrying a large bunch of hothouse flowers. 
COLONEL BRANDON How is the invalid? 
He hands MARIANNE the flowers with a smile. 
MARIANNE Thank you so much, Colonel. 
She rather absently hands the flowers to ELINOR, who goes for a vase. SIR JOHN gestures at BRANDON with bluff insensitivity. 
SIR JOHN Miss Marianne, I cannot see why you should set your cap at Mr Willoughby when you have already made such a splendid conquest! 
MARIANNE I have no intention of 'setting my cap' at anyone, Sir John! 
COLONEL BRANDON Mr Willoughby--Lady Allen's nephew? 
BRANDON's light tone betrays no emotion. ELINOR comes back in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to MARIANNE. 
SIR JOHN Aye, he visits every year for he is to inherit Allenham--and he has a very pretty estate of his own, Miss Dashwood, Combe Magna in Somerset. If I were you, I would not give him up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills. 
Suddenly MARGARET runs in screaming 'Marianne's preserver!' at the top of her voice. Everyone starts to move at once. MARGARET is silenced. BRANDON looks at MARIANNE, whose incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear. 
SIR JOHN Here is the man himself. Come, Brandon-- we know when we are not wanted. Let us leave him to the ladies! 
ELINOR Marianne! Sir John and the Colonel are leaving. 
MARIANNE looks up, suddenly self-conscious. 
MARIANNE Goodbye, Colonel. Thank you for the flowers. 
ELINOR sees them out. We hear WILLOUGHBY's voice outside. CLOSE on MARIANNE's radiant anticipation. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY 
WILLOUGHBY is shaking hands with COLONEL BRANDON and SIR JOHN. 
WILLOUGHBY How do you do, Colonel? 
SIR JOHN How does he do? How do you do, more like. Go on in, they're waiting for you! 
BRANDON looks at WILLOUGHBY for a moment. He bows. WILLOUGHBY bows. Then BRANDON and SIR JOHN exit. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
ELINOR leads in WILLOUGHBY. MRS DASHWOOD greets him with outstretched arms. 
MRS DASHWOOD Mr Willoughby! What a pleasure to see you again! 
WILLOUGHBY The pleasure is all mine, I can asstire you. I trust Miss Marianne has not caught cold? 
MARIANNE You have found out my name! 
WILLOUGHBY Of course. The neighbourhood is crawling with my spies. 
He suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his back and offers them to MARIANNE with a courtly, humorous bow. 
WILLOUGHBY And since you cannot venture out to nature, nature must be brought to you! 
MARIANNE How beautiful. These are not from the hothouse. 
WILLOUGHBY sees BRANDON's flowers. 
WILLOUGHBY Ah! I see mine is not the first offering, nor the most elegant. I am afraid I obtained these from an obliging field. 
MARIANNE But I have always preferred wild flowers! 
WILLOUGHBY I suspected as much. 
ELINOR takes the delicate flowers from WILLOUGHBY.

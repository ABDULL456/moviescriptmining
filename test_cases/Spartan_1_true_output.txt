He gestures to the bills on the bar. The Bartender swoops them up, and gestures to the back bar, meaning "What'll you have?" Scott points to a bottle of Bourbon, the Bartender pours for him. 
SCOTT (as he drinks) ...how about them Sox, huh...? 
BARTENDER Yuh. Whaddaya gonna do...? 
SCOTT "Curse of the Bambino". 
BARTENDER ...that's right. (pause) 
SCOTT Nice place you got here. 
BARTENDER You from out of town...? 
SCOTT Yeah, you know, actually, I was just looking for my Daughter... 
BARTENDER (as he smiles) ...that's what you're looking for...? 
SCOTT ...I. Uhh... 
BARTENDER ...ask, because a lot of out-of- town guys, come in, lookin, someone else's daughter. 
SCOTT No, I...Oh, no... 
BARTENDER (smiling) You sure...? 
SCOTT Abso, absolutely... 
He brings out his case, with the photo of the platinum- haired girl. The Bartender comes over and glances at it. 
ANGLE XCU on Scott as he looks incisively at the Bartender, who displays no flicker of recognition. 
SCOTT ...girl like that been in tonight...? 
BARTENDER ...pretty girl... 
SCOTT None prettier. 
ANGLE on Scott, who looks around the club. We see him eyeing the lovely young scantily clad waitresses, who return his looks with disdain. The Bartender, observing him, comes back to him. 
SCOTT Yeah...I'm looking for a girl like that... 
BARTENDER ...You're sure it was your daughter...? B'cause, a lot of guys, come in here, guys your age, go home with some...some rather 'younger' girl... 
The Bartender smiles. 
SCOTT (as he leans forward) Well, why would a, one of these 'younger girls'. What would they want to do with me...? 
The Bartender leans close and hesitates. Scott takes out several more bills and passes them to the Bartender. 
He hesitates a second, as if to say   "You wouldn't fuck me, would you...?" The Bartender signs,   "I am your man", the Bartender takes the bills and leans   close and whispers to Scott, indicating someone over in a   dark corner. 
In this corner, as the lights are flicked up, we see a youngish man in very expensive casual clothes, an American, dressed like Eurotrash, sitting talking with the man we saw earlier was the Manager. As Scott approaches, we see the Manager, knowingly, drift off. Beat. The young man (ZIMMER) rises from the booth, and tugs himself into neatness, and stops, as if bemused by Scott. 
ZIMMER 'Howdy, Pard'. 
SCOTT Hello. I wonder if you could help me... 
ZIMMER (as he yawns and looks at his watch, as he pushes past Scott) I love you, Baby, but the season's over... 
Zimmer starts for the front door, and Scott falls into step with him. 
SCOTT (gestures at the Bartender) ...my friend says that you're...you're sort of a 'matchmaker'... 
ZIMMER Izzat what he says...? 
Camera takes the two out of the front of   the club, where Zimmer tips the bouncer, who his putting   on his coat, preparatory to going away for the night.   Zimmer begins walking into a parking lot, where we see   several run-down employee's cars, and his, Zimmer's prime   Mercedes. Scott tags along. 
BOUNCER (as he walks away, to Zimmer, of Zimmer's car) I put her back in your space... 
SCOTT I was looking for a girl...a young girl... 
ZIMMER Aren't we all. 
SCOTT My, my, my, my, my, my question was: why would a young girl want to go out with an older man like me? And, if you could "answer" that... 
He takes out money from his pocket. Zimmer begins to speak slightingly, dismissively to the 'hick'. 
ZIMMER Look, Bub... 
Zimmer starts to open his car door. He turns back to Scott, and we see, Zimmer's POV, Anton, standing behind Scott, at the doorway to an alleyway. Obviously backing Scott up.

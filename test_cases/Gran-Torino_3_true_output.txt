WALT So how'd you blow your first initiation? Tao nods towards the GRAN TORINO. 
WALT The Gran Torino? Tao nods. Walt laughs. 
WALT Christ all Friday. 
INT. WALT'S BASEMENT 
Walt straps an old WESTINGHOUSE FREEZER onto a two- wheeled DOLLY. Walt attempts to pull the freezer upstairs. Walt strains with the heavy appliance. It's too much weight for Walt, but this doesn't stop him from heaving and pulling. Walt could have done this by himself when he was younger. Walt sits down on the step and breathes hard. 
INT. MITCH'S MASSIVE DEN 
Mitch watches afternoon baseball, drinking an imported, bottled beer. KAREN pokes her head into the room. 
KAREN See you later, I'm taking the kids to the mall. Mitch never looks up from the TV. 
MITCH Yeah, fine. Just don't spend too much goddamned money. 
KAREN I will. We hear Karen and the kids exit. 
MITCH Thank God. Finally get the house to myself for once. The PHONE RINGS. Mitch looks at the Caller ID. It says; Dad. Mitch almost doesn't pick it up...

MITCH Hello. 
WALT (V.O.) Hello? It's me, Dad... Walt. 
MITCH Hey, Dad. What's up? The CAMERA INTERCUTS BETWEEN Walt in his small kitchen and Mitch in his huge den. 
WALT Well... I... um... I'm getting the old Westinghouse up out of the basement. Mitch mouths the word Shit. 
MITCH Uh-huh. 
WALT So... I got it on the dolly. 
MITCH Yeah, that'll help. 
WALT Yeah... And it's a bit heavy... for one guy. 
MITCH Uh-huh. 
WALT Yeah... I need a hand. 
MITCH Oh. 
WALT So are you busy? 
MITCH Does it have to be done right this second? It's been down there for years. 
WALT Well... Yeah, I'd like to get on it.

MITCH Does it work? We were thinking about getting a freezer. What are you going to do with it? 
WALT Giving it to Aunt Mary. 
MITCH Oh... Can't she give you a hand? 
WALT She's eighty-one. 
MITCH I know, I was joking... What does she need it for? 
WALT To freeze food. Mitch opens another beer. 
MITCH Yeah, well, I'd love to help you out, Dad, but I'm just walking out the door. I have to bring the kids to the mall. Sorry. 
WALT Uh-huh.

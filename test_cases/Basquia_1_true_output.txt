INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) (to crew) Ready? 
He points to some scribbled words on the canvas. 
INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) ... Can you... decipher this for us? 
BASQUIAT Decipher? 
INTERVIEWER Yes. What do they... stand for? 
BASQUIAT They're just words. 
INTERVIEWER Yes, I understand - but where do you take them from? 
BASQUIAT Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from? (beat) Everywhere. 
INTERVIEWER (pointing to a detail) What are they? 
BASQUIAT (smiling mischievously) Leeches. A long list of leeches. (looking at some frames Shenge's working on) It looks good like that. 
INTERVIEWER Hmmm. And 'Parasites.' (beat) You seem to be a Primal Expressionist. 
BASQUIAT You mean like an ape? 
He grabs a huge double mouthful of French Fries and washes them down with champagne.. 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) (chewing, spilling) A primate? 
INTERVIEWER Well, you said that. (beat - looks at notes) You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you? 
BASQUIAT Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it? 
INTERVIEWER Yes, but as a black painter - 
BASQUIAT I use a lot of colors - not only black. 
INTERVIEWER What? 
BASQUIAT I'm not black. 
INTERVIEWER You're not? 
BASQUIAT Not what? 
INTERVIEWER Not black. 
BASQUIAT No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican. 
The BUZZER sounds. He signals for Steve not to answer the door. 
INTERVIEWER Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he? 
BASQUIAT (growing weary) Yup. 
INTERVIEWER Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home? 
BASQUIAT We don't hang them at home, y'know - just in the streets.. 
INTERVIEWER I see.. (beat) And... How do you respond to being called - hmmm... (peruses some notes) - yes, "the pickaninny of the art world." 
BASQUIAT (smiles - hurt, stunned) Who said that? 
INTERVIEWER Why, that's from Time Magazine. 
BASQUIAT No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy. 
INTERVIEWER Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution? 
Jean walks off camera like he just received a punch in the stomach. 
The filming of the interview becomes increasingly erratic. 
INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) Let me... just... open something up here. You come from a nice, middle class, respectable home. Your father is an accountant. Why did you at one time live in a cardboard box in Tompkins Square? 
Jean walks back into frame. 
INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto? 
BASQUIAT Are those the only two possibilities? (cramming a French Fry into his mouth) You wanna French fry? 
INTERVIEWER OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?

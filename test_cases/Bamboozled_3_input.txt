SLEEP 'N EAT ...aconite get it dat cheap. 
MANTAN I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.

OFF-SCREEN we HEAR the VOICE of MASSA CHARLIE, he's the overseer of this plantation. 
MASSA CHARLIE (O.S.) Who goes in there? 
SLEEP 'N EAT We'd better hide. 
MANTAN It's dat mean, evil overseer Massa Charlie. 
They hide behind some boxes. 
MASSA CHARLIE I say who goes in there? 
BOTH There's nobody in here 'cept us chickens. 
Massa Charlie enters the chicken coops with a SHOTGUN blazing.  Sleep 'N Eat and Mantan do a jig as they try to escape the buckshot. 
ON AUDIENCE 
They're rolling down the aisles in hysterics. 
INT. CONTROL BOOTH 
Everyone in the booth is laughing uncontrollably.  Except Delacroix.  Even Sloan is dying. 
DELACROIX Who's side are you on? 
SLOAN I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny. 
Delacroix starts to crack a smile.  He is definitely trying to hold it in. 
INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
He sits in front of the television, which is off. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) It was the Day of Reckoning.  After a massive advertising and publicity campaign... 
CLOSER 
Delacroix stares at the blank screen. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...the public would finally get a chance to view Mantan.  I was feelin' a little bit like Dr. Frankenstein. 
INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Sloan, Jessica, Mantan and Cheeba are gathered around the television in the small studio apartment, jabbering away. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest. 
SLOAN Everybody shut up. 
ON TV SCREEN 
We see the OPENING of MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.  It is in CLAYMATION.  Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat are doing a "jig."  Their noses and lips are done in a grotesque characterization, BIG WIDE BEGROIDAL NOSES and JUICY RED SAUCER SOUP COOLING LIPS. 
HONEYCUTT (V.O.) Calling all my cousins, you're about to take a trip down to Hang 'Em High Plantation, home of your two favorite coons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat. 
ON SLOAN, JESSICA, MANTAN, AND CHEEBA 
Mantan isn't happy.

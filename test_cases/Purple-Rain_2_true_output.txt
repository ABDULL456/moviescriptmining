JELLYBEAN (enraged) Fucker!! 
He twists Prince's head backwards, SMASHES his body to the ground-- 
JELLYBEAN Stay still, motherfucker!! 
But Prince continues fighting him with everything he's got!  Jellybean is astonished-- 
JELLYBEAN Shit!! 
He twists Prince's neck savagely, SMASHES! his legs to the floor again and again-- 
JELLYBEAN Stop!! 
Vanity is crying-- 
VANITY Jellybean, please... 
Prince drops to his hands and knees exhausted.  Everybody is frozen now -- scared.  The Girls are crying, the incedent has already gone too far... 
Jellybean settles his weight on Prince, twists his head down painfully, trying to break the resistance he alone can feel.  Prince remains silent, the anger coursing through his body in tremors-- 
The Guys surround them, grabbing Prince's arms, legs, and feet.  He's like a trapped animal now-- 
JELLYBEAN Lift him. 
VANITY (crying) Don't hurt him ... 
They pick him up, move him toward the door.  He resists them slightly, his body lurching in fit and starts. Suddenly he breaks free, faces them with his back to he door.  But the Band Members surround him, their wills united, the obviousness of the situation apparent to all. 
He searches for Vanity's eyes, but she can't face him and walks away.  Anger again surges in his veins.  He cuts out the door, SLAMS it behind him. 
(77) EXT. ACCESS ROAD, TRAIN TRACKS -- DUSK 
Prince WHIPS down a dirt access road locked in thought, the pain and anger in his eyes apparent.  Suddenly a TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS just behind him, sending a shot of fear through his guts. 
He twists backwards in amazement.  A FREIGHT TRAIN ROARS around the bend BLASTING its HORN violently.  Prince shudders with fright, loses control of his cycle for an instant.  He hits a series of ruts that almost topple him to the ground. 
He looks back at the train confused, when another BLAST seems to SOCK him in the teeth.  He twists wildly to the side of the road, kicking up dirt and debris, lurching him into the handlebars violently. 
The TRAIN ROARS abreast of him!  Prince snaps an angry look at the engineer. The Guy coolly gives him the finger and BLASTS the HORN violently. 
Prince becomes enraged!  He snaps a look to the speedometer: 65 mph.  He snaps a look to the Engineer -- the Guy sends him another obscene gesture and BLASTS his HORN. 
Prince grits his teeth, twists the throttle full.  He lurches forward in an instant, blazing in front of the train, The Engineer BLASTS the HORN mercilessly, and throws on the coals. They blast down the stretch neck to neck, twist round a wide bend. 
Prince edges in front!  The Engineer BLASTS the HORN and moves up.  Prince snaps a look to him -- the Guy mouths the words:  Fuck You! 
Prince wants to scream!  He twists the throttle, snaps a look to the speedometer:  75 mph.  He RIPS past ruts and gullies like a madman.  The TRAIN moves up.  They blast around another bend neck to neck 
Suddenly Prince's eyes widen with horror.  A CAR is parked across the access road, waiting to cross the track. He shoots a look to the Engineer -- the Guy is laughing hysterically now, BLASTING his HORN wildly, mouthing the words:  Bye Bye! 
Prince screams like  a MADMAN!  He twists his  throttle FULL!  He blazes ahead of the train, BLASTS! up the embankment, SAILS through the air... 
...a BRICK WALL cuts the access road in two! 
He SCREAMS in bloody terror!  He hits the road and fishtails wildly, locking his brakes.  The WALL comes at him like a locomotive.  He's going to hit it, knows it and... 
He twists his throttle violently BLASTS! directly into the path of the train! 
The Engineer looks on in horror!  Prince throws his weight forward and... 
...the train ROARS past him as he fishtails wildly to a stop. 
The Engineer sails off into the dusk, his mouth agape.  Prince sits there breathing fiercely, the adrenaline shrieking though his veins, watching the train disappear into the distance. 
(78) EXT. STREETS AND ALLEY -- DOWNTOWN -- TWILIGHT 
SHOPPERS flood the sidewalks, rushing for the buses that take them home.  TRAFFIC clogs  at the 77 intersections while PEDESTRIANS walk against the lights.  Prince rides down the streets, hugging the right shoulder, impatient with the delays.  He blasts down a side street, sees FLASHING LIGHTS up ahead.  GAWKERS are already crowding around. 
He moves through the TRAFFIC slowly, glides past a POLICE CAR, and a small CROWD.  A CAR has run onto the sidewalk, knocking down the marquee to a rundown, neighborhood bar.

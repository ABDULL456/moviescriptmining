GET OUT

Jordan Peele 
I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. -Romans 12:1-2 
EXT. THE SHAW'S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - NIGHT 
A perfect suburban house with bay windows and a front lawn. The SHAW family. Caucasian and warm - RICHARD, 34; NANCY, 30; JOSHUA, 6; and MAY, 4 - eat dinner inside. Richard reads something on his tablet illuminating his face. 
JOSHUA Which one are we going to? 
RICHARD The one in Orlando. 
NANCY Disney World. 
JOSHUA Tony said that Mickey is not really Mickey; it's someone else in there. 
RICHARD Mickey's Mickey. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 
ANDRE, 29, an African-American man runs down the sidewalk in sweats. He listens to jazz on his phone. The music stops. He stops running and checks his phone. 
ANDRE Damn. 
He's right in front of the Shaw's house. He glances inside. The Shaw's seem normal and content. Andre smiles. 
A motion detecting security light floods the lawn. 
INT. THE SHAW'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Richard looks up from his table to see Andre standing there. The rest of the family doesn't notice. Nancy tends to May, who SQUIRMS in her chair. Richard watches Andre protectively. 
JOSHUA Also, Tony said he saw a chef Mickey and a normal Mickey. 
NANCY He must have changed his clothes for work. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Andre walks on. It's getting dark. He is suddenly very alone. 
A vintage creme-colored Porsche Boxter with tinted windows and a roof CREEPS up on the street behind Andre. It's following him. 
INT. SPORTS CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Driver's POV watching Andre. His BREATH ECHOES deep and tinny as if it were into a coffee can. Through the car's system we hear an English to French language tutorial recording. 
TUTORIAL Pardon me. Where is the nearest restaurant? Pardonnez-moi. Ou est le restaurant le plus proche? 
The driver doesn't repeat. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Andre, feeling followed, stops to tie his shoe. The car also stops. Andre waves at the unseen DRIVER. There is no response. The ENGINE PURRS. 
Andre begins walking again. The car begins slowly too. Andre stops again. The car does too. Andre peers through the windshield but can't see through the tint. 
ANDRE Can I help you...? 
No response. 
ANDRE (CONT'D) I'm new to the area. I just moved here... Down on Evergreen... 
Nothing. Did I do something wrong? 'Cause-- 
INT. SPORTS CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Driver's POV. Andre continues to talk, but isn't heard. 
TUTORIAL Can you show me the nearest bathroom? Pouvez-vous me montrer la salle de bain la plus prouche?

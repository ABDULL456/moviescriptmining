INT. PRIEST'S CAR. NIGHT. 
Orange rescue lights reflect through the windshield of the priest's car as it crawls past the crashed sedan and police vehicle. 
Father Laurence thumps the steering wheel in frustration. 
FATHER LAURENCE Saint Francis be my speed tonight! 
Across the road Police swarm around the entrance to the cemetery. 
FATHER LAURENCE Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing. 
HOLD ON: The green glow of the car clock as the seconds pulse away. 
INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
TRACK: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames. 
DISCOVER: Romeo. He weakly stands at the entrance to the viewing chapel. 
The chapel is dark. 
As Romeo's eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping girl. He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead Capulets. 
Romeo is close now. He halts as if in the presence of an unbelievable vision. He lights a match and the room glows gold. The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful in seeming death. 
Romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround her. 
ROMEO O my love, my wife, Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty, Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there. 
Romeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping child. Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers. 
ROMEO (CONT.) Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe that unsubstantial 
DEATH Is amorous and keeps thee here in 
DARK To be his paramour? For fear of 
THAT I still will stay with thee. Here, oh here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious 
STARS From this world-wearied flesh. 
He lays himself close. 
ROMEO (CONT.) Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss... 
Gently Romeo kisses Juliet's lips. Ever so slightly, Juliet's hand moves - Romeo does not notice. 
ROMEO (CONT.) A dateless bargain to engrossing death. 
Romeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is immediate. He convulses and falls, his head resting on Juliet. 
ROMEO (CONT.) (fighting for breath) O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick. 
Behind Romeo's head we can see Juliet's eyes opening. Romeo sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs. Through a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo. 
JULIET Oh Romeo, what's here? 
Forcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms. Romeo's clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across motionless lips. 
Juliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo's hand. Tears slip from her eyes. 
JULIET (CONT.) Drunk all, and left No friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on 
THEM To make me die with a restorative. 
She delicately kisses Romeo's lips. 
JULIET (CONT.) (a heart-broken whisper) Thy lips are warm. 
Desperately the lovers cling to each other. With all his desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers: 
ROMEO Thus with a kiss I die. 
There is no breath. He is still. Silence. Sobbing, Juliet hugs the lifeless Romeo to her. 
JULIET Romeo. O' my true love Romeo. 
She looks to the gun in his hand. 
EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
TRACK: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking cover behind a patrol car. 
Two police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife toward them. 
Discover Father Laurence arriving. 
CUT TO: Father Laurence's P.O.V.: Patrol cars, lights flashing, surround the mausoleum. 
He sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand- cuffed youth. It is Balthasar. Father Laurence hurries to him.

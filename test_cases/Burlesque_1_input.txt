WHAT?. I AM A GOOD GIRL. Ali finishes the song to big applause. Takes her bow. Makes her way off the stage and ACROSS the club to... JACK AT THE BAR - he turns to see Ali. 
ALI (CONT'D) Hiya, big boy. She spins herself around on a bar stool, so he can see all angles. Jack likes plenty. Way too much. 
ALI (CONT'D) What do you think? 
JACK 
(FLUSTERED) It's...I think-you look...I mean, yeah... do you like it? Not the reaction she was looking for. 
ALI Jack. It's okay for you to think I look hot. We're friends for chrissakes. It's not like we're brother and sister. 
She rolls her eyes, gets up, and heads backstage. Jack watches her go-- 
JACK 
(TO HIMSELF) No. We certainly are not.

The Burlesque Girls are prepping for the show. 
NIKKI Why the hell is everyone having a conniption over her? She's just a tacky, pushy girl from a -- Ali -- sexy, sophisticated, gorgeous -- enters. 
NIKKI (CONT'D) -- fly-over state. Ali pretends she didn't hear. She sits at her mirror. The girls stare at her, mouths agape. Ali picks up her mascara wand, looks down the mirror at Nikki's reflection. 
ALI 
(FAUX INNOCENT) What's a fly-over state? Ali takes a deft stroke of her wand over her lashes, then bats them at Nikki. Nikki walks out. Coco smiles with appreciation. Whistles long and low. The girls all laugh. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT 
Tess glad-hands guests, then spots Vince, waving at her. She starts over, then sees Marcus in the booth with Vince. She turns and walks the other way. Vince catches up to her. 
VINCE 
TESS -- 
TESS Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd have sold to those idiots building that monstrosity across the street. I said no. 
VINCE Which made Marcus bump his offer up again. It's obscene, what he wants to give us. At least hear him out. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - TESS'S CLUTTERED OFFICE - NIGHT 
Tess, at her desk, reads a contract. Marcus and Vince sit across from her, watching. 
MARCUS It's very simple. I buy you out and pay you a million off the top. (motions to Vince) Five hundred grand each. Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus. 
TESS Why do you want this club so badly? 
MARCUS Best view on the Sunset Strip. 
VINCE Do you know what you could do with that money, Tess? 
TESS Do you know what you can do with that money, Vince? 
VINCE Be reasonable. We're rolling vendors ninety days out. 
MARCUS The club's not even worth what you paid for it. You've got a second mortgage, you can't get a third. Tess looks at Vince, betrayed.

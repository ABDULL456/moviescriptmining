CONTINUED: 
RORSCHACH Sorry, Miss Jupiter. I thought I should tell you the bad news--the Comedian has been murdered. 
DR. MANHATTAN Yes, since he and I are the only two extranormal operatives currently employed by the government, I was informed. The CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic groups. Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He speaks in a cold, even, matter of fact manner. 
RORSCHACH I have my own theories. But neither of you seem too concerned. 
DR. MANHATTAN A live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles. Structurally there's no difference. 
LAURIE Well, I might not be able to count molecules, but either way, Blake was a bastard. You know he tried to rape my mother? 
RORSCHACH Sounds like you may have had a score to settle. You or your mother. 
LAURIE What? Are you accusing-- 
DR. MANHATTAN Rorschach, please don't upset Laurie. I 
DON'T-- He pauses as if he hears something. 
DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D) Excuse me for a moment. Suddenly he disappears. 
EXT. PORT OF LONG BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
A group of suspicious looking MIDDLE EASTERN MEN watch as a CONTAINER is being loaded onto a TRUCK-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: --when suddenly Dr. Manhattan materializes in a blue flash, floating in mid-air. The Middle Eastern Men shield their eyes from the light, then realize in awe and fear 
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN (in Arabic) It's him He's, he's real. Allah help us, he's real! The men run for it but it's useless--Dr. Manhattan shoots BEAMS OF ENERGY at them, freezing all the men in mid motion-- --when PORT SECURITY pulls up. They get out of their jeeps, in awe of Dr. Manhattan, still floating in mid-air. 
DR. MANHATTAN These men were transporting a shipment of enriched uranium-- With a gesture, the container floats off the truck and separates into pieces . . revealing the URANIUM inside. Suddenly the uranium changes-- 
DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D) I've safely transformed the uranium into sand. I trust you can take things from here. And just like that he disappears-- 
INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS 
--and is back in the lab without missing a beat. 
RORSCHACH --I'm not here to judge the moral discrepancies of a man who died in service of his country. 
LAURIE You call rape a moral discrepancy?! 
DR. MANHATTAN Rorschach--you're upsetting Laurie. I think you ought to go. 
RORSCHACH I came here to warn you both, just like I warned Adrian and Dan. I believe someone may be targeting masked heroes-- 
DR. MANHATTAN I said you ought to go. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RORSCHACH It took a lot of effort to get in here. I'm not leaving before I've-- With a look, Dr. Manhattan makes Rorschach disappear. 
EXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - CONTINUOUS 
Rorschach materializes down the road from the base. 
RORSCHACH --had my say Rorschach realizes what just happened. Checks himself, his surroundings. Reorients himself. With nothing else he can do, he heads down the road. 
INT. LABORATORY - SAME TIME 
Dr. Manhattan resumes his work. He looks distracted. 
DR. MANHATTAN He's gone. Are you okay now? 
LAURIE 
YEAH (studies Dr. Manhattan) Are you okay, Jon? Dr. Manhattan pauses for a moment, thoughtful. 
DR. MANHATTAN I'm having trouble with my vision. I can't see clearly what lies ahead. There's some static interference. 
LAURIE Interference? Caused by what? 
DR. MANHATTAN I'm uncertain. A power surge of great magnitude? Perhaps a nuclear detonation.

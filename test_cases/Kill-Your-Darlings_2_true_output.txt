BILL We are exploring the avenues of Allen's mind. 
David looks around the mess of his living room, his pillaged library of books, papers all over the floor. 
DAVID Dimly-lit, I am sure. What have you done to my apartment? 
Allen struggles to his feet, moaning. Lucien steps between David and their wall of clippings. 
LUCIEN David, don't touch anything. We have to write it all down. 
Bill stands up, woozy. Calls out to David. 
BILL Get this man a pair of scissors! 
DAVID This is not your revolution, this is my life. 
BILL What kind of life is it? 
DAVID It's mine. Not everyone gets an allowance. (beat) Leave. Get out! 
Allen stumbles out of the room, scared. David approaches Lucien. 
DAVID I need to speak to you. Alone. 
INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Allen splashes water on his face. In the mirror, he sees David and Lucien in the bedroom. 
David hands Lucien a TERM PAPER. 
LUCIEN (O.S.) It only has to be five pages. 
He tilts the mirror to see them clearly. A glimpse into their private dynamic. 
INT. BEDROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Lucien flips through the term paper. 
LUCIEN You make me too smart, they're gonna suspect something's up. 
David throws Lucien's coat over his shoulder. 
DAVID And get you sent back to your mother again? That would just be the end of you. 
LUCIEN Fuck you. 
David spots Allen watching from the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM - 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Allen, caught, looks down, pretends he heard nothing. But it's too late. David walks over and SLAMS the door in Allen's face. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES (O.S.) Kill your darlings. 
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY 
Professor Steeves, intent, in front of the class. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES Your crushes, your juvenile metaphysics. None of them belong on the page. It is the first principle of good creative work. A work of fiction you will deliver as your final exam. 
He sees Allen, badly hungover and brooding, writing in a journal. Ignoring class. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES Oh look. Whitman Jr. graced us with his presence today. 
Steeves walks to Allen's desk, grabs his journal. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES "The New Vision. Extraordinary men propel us forward. It is our duty to break the law." (to Allen) Fantastic. 
ALLEN There's more life in those five pages than in the dozens of bad sonnets we've read in class. 
Steeves cocks his eye, stares down Allen. The first time Allen has defied anyone. Ever. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES You want life? You want the world on fire? 
Steeves motions to the door. Then to Allen. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES The war awaits. What will it be? 
Steeves tosses the journal back down on Allen's desk.

DIEGO Why? 
JUDIT 
(Evasive) It's a long story. 
DIEGO (Persistent) Summarize it! 
JUDIT Diego, please, this is not the moment. 
DIEGO It never is for you! 
JUDIT (Exasperated) Hey, if it bothers you so much to look after Harry, I'll quit the job and stay in Madrid! Or I'll hire someone. 
DIEGO It doesn't bother me to look after Harry! But I am tired of so much secrecy! 
(It's a civilized encounter, no screaming. There is tension, but it is kept under control by both of them) 
49. IN A PUBLIC PARK AND ON THE STREET. EXT. DAY. 2008 
A public park. Diego and Harry are walking along a straight pathway. Kids, dogs, people jogging. It is a tranquil and pleasant place. Diego is in front, Harry is behind him, holding on to his elbow, (as reference), but it's Harry who is moving faster, pushing Diego from his elbow. The boy shows signs of exhaustion, he is wearing black sunglasses. 
DIEGO Don't go so fast! 
HARRY 
We are exercising... 
DIEGO I'm not. I'm just keeping you company. How can you walk so fast? 
HARRY I am training and I don't work at night, nor do I drug myself. 
DIEGO (On guard) What do you mean by that? 
HARRY That I take care of myself, with the fanaticism of an older, handicapped person. 
DIEGO You are no fanatic. 
HARRY Yes, I am. All of us who survive a critical physical injury are. There is no other way. 
Cut to. 
50. CONTINUED. EXT. DAY. 
They exit the park. While they wait at a stop sign, a billboard catches Diego's attention. Half of the billboard is taken up by the motto: DONATE BLOOD. The names of participating ambulatory hospitals and their hours appear below. 
Harry can tell his company is distracted, so he asks him: 
HARRY 
What are you looking at? 
DIEGO A billboard. 
HARRY Why so? 
DIEGO In huge letters it says "Donate Blood", it includes where one has to go. 
HARRY You want to donate blood? 
DIEGO No, no... I was thinking that "Donate Blood" is a good title for a movie... 
HARRY Yes. It has a good ring. 
DIEGO For a vampire flick. 
Harry finds it amusing. They walk toward home. 
HARRY It's true. 
DIEGO (Ironizing, kidding, improvising) Imagine that behind the billboard a whole group of vampires that work in ambulatory care are hiding... and they actually keep the blood they get from donors for their own consumption, of course... 
HARRY Your mother would like that story. 
Cut to. 
51. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008 
Mariacruz, the Latin American maid, is preparing something in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Diego and Mateo gather around the table. Diego sits in front of his laptop. 
Both of the characters are improvising, rapidly, and become increasingly excited, completing each other's sentences. They are having fun, as if playing a game. The sequence becomes a demonstration of the process of creating fiction, based on an trivial, real anecdote. (They will begin the sequence by opening a document. Diego writes the title in caps: DONATE BLOOD.) 
DIEGO The vampires would be like a type of ethnic group, completely assimilated into Spanish society, they don't stand out. There are vampires who occupy important positions, keeping it a secret (like the Opus Dei). But even though they live in the shadows, they have amassed great social and economic power... 
HARRY They control various industries. For example, the one responsible for dark sunglasses... 
DIEGO (Smiles) And those that provide nightly entertainment: bars, discos, after-hours... Since they don't need drugs to stay awake, they are the most apt for working at night. They don't burn out... 
HARRY 
And for the sunscreen business. The poor things are very sensitive to climate change and to the holes in the ozone layer. Their sunscreens are some of the best on the market. 
DIEGO (Laughs) And those which sell best... This is all great...

Thirty feet from the barn there is an air vent sticking out of the ground. The top flies off and Saul emerges. He flops onto the ground, then immediately scampers to his and pulls out his gun. Saul looks to the open road to freedom, then back at the barn. 
SAUL Fuck... 
INT. GIANT UNDERGROUND GROW ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Dale frantically runs through the rows of plants, when SUDDENLY he sees the strange scuba suit out of the corner of his eye and swings his gun at it, nearly opening fire. 
DALE (whispering) Oh god. 
Dale slows down to catch his breath, staring at the strange scuba suit. Then, he gets an idea. 
ANGLE ON: Ted, quietly walking through the room 
Ted raises his gun as he spins around a corner. 
TED Where are you, you son-of-a-bitch? 
Ted turns another corner and sees the strange scuba suit. He starts to walk past it, when he stops himself. He creeps back and looks at it, suspicious. He walks closer, breathing as quietly as he can, his gun clenched tightly. He slowly reaches his hand out to lift the face-hatch. He gently takes hold of the latch and is about to open it, when- 
Dale jumps out from behind him and swings a FIRE EXTINGUISHER at Ted's face - SLAM!!! Ted drops his gun as he falls to the floor. 
DALE Ha! 
Ted leaps upwards and uppercuts Dale hard!!! 
EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 
Saul inches towards the barn, hearing a melee of gunfire and screams as he nears it. He cautiously peers in and watches as Carol shoots an assassin in the chest then spins around and shoots at another assassin who desperately runs with a METAL BRIEFCASE handcuffed to his wrist. Carol hits him several times; he lurches over and falls through the trap door. She smiles and drops her empty gun. 
Saul watches Carol as she heads towards the trap door. He takes a deep breath and CHARGES into the barn, unleashing a barrage of bullets at her! BLAM BLAM BLAM! CLICK. 
CLICK. CLICK. None of the bullets hit her. She turns and sees Saul, who drops his empty gun. 
SAUL Fuck tha po-lice. 
They both SCREAM in rage and CHARGE, fists flying as they collide. Carol whips Saul around by his collar and hurls him to the ground. She runs up and kicks him in the gut, time and time again. 
CAROL I'm a fucking cop, you moron. 
SAUL AAAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHH!!! 
Saul leaps to his feet and PUNCHES Carol in the face. He PUNCHES her again. She reaches for her mace, so Saul kicks her in the groin and grabs it for himself, then sprays her in the face. 
SLAM! He punches her in the face. 
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS 
Ted and Dale are squared off. Both are bloody lipped and bruised. Dale continuously shucks and jives on the spot as they talk. 
DALE You can't fucking take me. I'm young. Virile. Prime of my life. You're old. Old and dying. 
TED I don't know who you are, Denton, or why you're trying to ruin my life, but you're fuckin' dead! 
Ted rips off his shirt, revealing dozens of fearsome tattoos and scars. Dale quickly picks a grow light up off the ground. Ted does the same. The humming of the grow lights is heard as the two men walk in a circle, squared off. 
TED (CONT'D)                      DALE AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!              AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!! 
They both swing and their grow lights collide, sending shards of glass everywhere. 
Both receive several small cuts. The immediately charge at each other and are soon grappling on the ground. 
INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 
Carol writhes on the ground as Saul runs towards her with a plank of wood. SMASH! He shatters it over her head. Carol drops, unconscious. 
Saul drops to his knees, exhausted. 
SAUL Crazy  huff   huff , psycho bitch... 
MATHESON (O.S.) Hey Saul! 
Saul turns around to see Matheson clutching his bleeding gut with one hand and a loaded gun with the other. 
MATHESON (CONT'D) I owe you one. In the gut. Then the balls, and then the- 
CRASH!!! Red's car SMASHES through the side of the barn and SLAMS into Matheson, PULVERIZING him!!! 
It lurches to a stop directly ON TOP OF THE HATCH leading underground. Red steps out of the car.

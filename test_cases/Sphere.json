{"train": "Barnes walks toward a TECHNICIAN, sitting at a keyboard. \nBARNES (to technician) Bring up the grid, would you? \nANGLE ON THE MONITOR as an IMAGE OF THE CRAFT begins to form. \nNORMAN What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite? \nBARNES Something like that. (beat) That doesn't surprise you? \nNORMAN Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash? \nBARNES As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago. \nA beat. \nNORMAN Four hundred?  You're kidding, right? \nANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft and a small layer of ROCK above it. \nBARNES See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick. \nNORMAN Geologists? \nBARNES Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year -- \nNORMAN -- Wait a second -- \nBARNES -- dating the crash at least that old. \nNORMAN Hold on -- \nBARNES Maybe older -- \nNORMAN -- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old. \nBARNES Extraordinary, isn't it? \nNORMAN It's impossible. \nBARNES I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor. \nINT.  STAIRWELL \nBarnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs. \nBARNES Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me. \nNORMAN It doesn't make any sense. \nBARNES We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now. \nNORMAN What team? \nBARNES The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration. \nNORMAN ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it? \nAs they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from under his arm, hands it to Norman. \nNorman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it. \nBARNES Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail. \nNORMAN But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life. \nINT.  BRIEFING ROOM \nON A VIDEO SCREEN -- sonar video of the spacecraft. \nBETH (O.S.) How big is this spacecraft? \nBARNES (O.S.) Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet. \nTED (O.S.) A half a mile long? \nBARNES The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen. \nThe team members sit around the conference table: \nTED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here.  BETH HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron. ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet.  HARRY ADAMS, 32, mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit. \nHARRY How much damage? \nBARNES To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch. \nHARRY Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch? \nBARNES I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts. (continuing) The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented. \nTED Never invented? \nON NORMAN, watching the team... \nBETH In basic English, what does all this mean? \nBARNES Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet. \nA LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRR \nINT.  TESTING ROOM -- LATER \nA large, X-Ray APPARATUS moves to the side, revealing Norman's FACE. \nON BETH -- standing next to him. \nBETH Five years.  No phone calls.  What am I -- a leper? \nNorman sits up... \nNORMAN Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret? \nBETH I love secrets. \nNORMAN That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about? \nBETH I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant. \nNORMAN It's bullshit.  The report's a joke. \nBETH (beat) That's quite a secret. \nNORMAN I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea -- \nANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN, standing behind glass in the next room, monitoring Beth and Norman. \nThe hatch door LOCKS, loudly.  The sub lurches, and begins descending. \nTED Pussy. \nBETH What's that -- mistake number two, Norman? \nNORMAN He wasn't feeling well. \nTED He's a pussy. \nHarry is still staring at Norman... \nHARRY How are you feeling, Norman? \nNORMAN What? \nHARRY You holding up alright? \nNORMAN Fine.  I'm fine. \nHARRY Don't be defensive. \nNORMAN I'm not being defensive. \nHARRY You sound defensive. \nNORMAN I'm fine. \nTED (to Harry) What'd you say to him? \nHARRY To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know. \nTED What does Norman already know? \nHARRY Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake. \nNorman looks over at Beth. \nHARRY She told me what you said, Norman. \nTED What is it, Harry? \nHARRY Just one of Norman's many secrets. \nON NORMAN, saying nothing. \nEXT.  OCEAN \nWE SEE the sub descending into darker waters. \nEXT.  DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK \nThe SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal.  Around it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights. \nINT.  AIRLOCK -- PRESSURIZING ROOM \nCLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking. \nOFFICER (O.S.) One moment for pressurizing. \nA SOFT WHIRR. \nANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the small, claustrophobic pressurizing room.  Like sardines.  Nobody says anything.  A long beat. \nTHE DOOR \nin front of them, opens.  TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, a big-boned female officer, stands before them.  She wears a black plastic PAD, a \"talker\", around her neck. \nShe hands each member their own \"talker\".  Norman takes his. \nINT.  DH-8 HALLWAY \nFletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway.  Each of them wears the \"talkers\" around their necks. \nBARNES They pressurize us with helium. \nNORMAN What's wrong with oxygen? \nBARNES It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile. \nTED Important safety tip.  Thanks Captain. \nFletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to Barnes... \nFLETCHER Captain, the divers have the airlock mounted at the door.  The robot is now in position to enter the spacecraft. \nTED Robot?  What robot? \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nCLOSE ON A MONITOR -- showing the robot in front of the curved gray metal of the spacecraft. \nBARNES Edmunds, bring up the robot's camera feed. \nJANE EDMUNDS, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel.  Another MONITOR clicks on -- showing the robot's POV of the door. \nTED Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television. \nBARNES Nobody goes inside, until we know what's inside. \nON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans the spacecraft hull, stops on a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door. \nBARNES Can you open that panel? \nEDMUNDS Working on it now, sir. \nON THE MONITOR -- a robotic CLAW extends out to the panel.  Trying to pry the panel open. \nTED I'd like it noted in the report that I think we should be doing this ourselves.  Making a manned entry... \nThe claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal. \nTED I'd also like it noted -- \nBARNES Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction. \nON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber sucker.  It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck. \nEDMUNDS It's not sucking, sir. \nBARNES Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else. \nEDMUNDS We don't have anything else to try, Sir. \nBARNES Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up -- \nIn the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft, WE SEE a tunnel -- cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs. \nINT.  TUNNEL \nAbout 60 feet deep.  Narrower than they'd like.  Norman descends, clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to the coral walls. \nTHE LOUD HISSING OF AIR \nINT.  SPACECRAFT AIRLOCK \nCLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE as he watches the water recede, down past his faceplate. \nTHE LOUD BANGING OF METAL \nTed has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a sledgehammer. \nHARRY Easy Ted, we're not mining gold. \nTED Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space. \nThey all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted keeps swinging. \nBETH Looks alot like an airplane door, doesn't it? \nTed stops and looks at the door. \nTED Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't... \nHARRY Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering. \nNORMAN You want me to try? \nTED You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do? \nBARNES Give him the hammer, Ted. \nNorman takes the hammer.  Walks up to the wedge.  Gets his bearings. Rears back... then stops. \nTED What is it, your back give out? \nSomething has caught Norman's eye.  He looks down at the wedge. \nBARNES What is it, Norman? \nNORMAN Take a look. \nBarnes comes toward him.  The others follow.  Barnes bends down, looks closely down at the wedge in the door. \nBARNES It's chipped. \nHARRY Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped? \nBARNES I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped. \nHARRY I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash? \nBARNES I did. \nHARRY Then how can it be chipped? \nON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms, feels around. \nBETH There's heat coming the door. \nBARNES Back away then. \nBETH Wait a minute -- \nBARNES I said back away. \nBETH Would you wait a minute? \nTHE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE \nBarnes unstraps a GUN -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his buckle. \nBARNES Ted, get her away from the door. \nTED What are you going to do -- shoot her? \nThe RUMBLING louder... \nBARNES Get her away! \nTHE DOOR begins to slide open. \nBeth backs away. \nTHE DOOR, sliding, is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside.  The door stops, it's open, it's quiet.  They all stand there, looking at BLACKNESS.  A long beat. \nINT.  SPACECRAFT \nON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside.  His helmet light SHINES on the others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK, suspended high in the air. \nMetallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them. \nNorman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40 feet of darkness, dimly lighting the LOWER HULL, a dense network of STRUTS and GIRDERS. \nTED Look at this. \nBARNES What is it? \nTed SPOTLIGHTS the OUTER HULL. \nTED Some sort of lead or something. \nBARNES Radiation shield, you think? \nTED A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation. \nBeth's light SHINES down onto the CATWALK.  WE SEE FOOTPRINTS outlined on the dusty floor. \nBETH Hold on -- \nBARNES What is it? \nBETH Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up? \nTED No.  I don't think so. \nBETH Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine. \nTED Well, they're not mine. \nON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large, like the boots they're wearing. \nBARNES What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back? \nTED Maybe we didn't want to come back. \nBACK IN -- THE ROOM \nNorman, Harry, and Beth... \nBETH What are you looking for? \nHARRY A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power. \nON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS. \nBETH What's that noise? \nThey LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE. \nNORMAN Sounds a little like water -- \nSUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him -- sucking him inside... \nBETH Norman! \nNORMAN Get this thing off me. \nBeth bends down, presses a button, the CHAIR releases Norman... \nBETH I think the chair thinks you want to fly this thing. \nON BETH's FACEPLATE -- as she's looking down -- WE BEGIN TO SEE -- reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering across... \n\"RV-LHOOQ... DCOM1... \" \nHer EYES look up slowly... as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE BLACK SCREEN in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow lettering: \n\"RV -- LHOOQ -- DCOMl -- U.S.S STAR VOYAGER\" \n\"ASSIMILATING DATABASE\" as a series of numbers race upwards in count... \nAnd the desk in front of them LIGHTS UP, a control panel coming to life. \nHARRY Nice work, Norman. \nNORMAN Whatever I can do to help. \nON THE SCREEN as it changes, now filled with columns: \nSHIP SYSTEMS DATA SYSTEMS QUARTER MASTER FLIGHT RECORDS \nHarry punches some keys on the control panel. \nHARRY A flight recorder.  Our future is about to be seen in our present. \nON THE SCREEN as it changes: \nFLIGHT DATA SUMMARIES FDS 01/01/47-12/31/49 FDS 01/01/50-12/31/52 FDS 01/01/53-12/31/55 FDS 01/01/56-12/31/56 FDS 01/01/56-02/01/56 FDS 02/02/56-UNKNOWN ENTRY EVENT \nNORMAN 01-01-47.  Two thousand-forty seven. 50 years in our future. \nHARRY Unknown Entry Event. \nHarry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys... \nON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving... WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the illusion of depth. \nThe IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like we're flying through it. \nThe stars and other space matter streaking by. \nBETH What's that cluster of stars there? In the center? \nHarry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image... \nHARRY Our answer. \nNORMAN To what? \nHARRY Time travel.  A black hole. \nThe CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer and closer, brightening. \nThe FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole. \nON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS: \nHARRY (O.S.) Ted?  Captain? \nBARNES (O.S.) Yes, Harry. \nHARRY (O.S.) We know how this craft got here. Where it's been. \nBARNES (O.S.) So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels. \nSTILL ON NORMAN -- frightened... \nNORMAN Picked up something?  What is it? \nBARNES (O.S.) I don't know.  But it's something alien. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CARGO BAY \nANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance.  AS WE PAN UP and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly swirling green and blue fluids.  Like mercury.  Mesmerizlng. \nAS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top. \nThey walk around it, circling it, looking up at it. \nHARRY This answers one of our questions. \nNORMAN Which one?  Let me get the list out. \nHARRY This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... sphere.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home. \nNORMAN But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past. \nHARRY Our present. \nBARNES But what does it do?  This... sphere. \nNORMAN Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone. \nHARRY Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone. \nNorman gets out of his bed. \nNORMAN I can't believe that, Harry. \nHARRY Gimme another explanation. \nNorman pacing. \nNORMAN I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong. \nHARRY Am I? \nNORMAN Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight. \nHARRY You mean, you think I'm cracking? \nNORMAN No.  I didn't say that. \nHARRY Then what, Norman? \nNorman stops pacing, a beat. \nNORMAN It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you. \nHARRY Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nCLOSE ON MONITOR: Video of the sphere.  RAPIDLY rewinding. \nBARNES What caused it? \nEDMUNDS Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all. \nHARRY When did it happen? \nEDMUNDS Seconds ago.  Here! \nPLAYBACK: WE SEE the sphere -- idle.  Nothing around it.  Then it's DOOR slowly OPENS, revealing BLACKNESS inside.  A beat.  And then it closes. \nBARNES Let me see that again. \nEdmunds plays it again.  This time... \nWE MOVE IN ON HARRY, staring at the monitor. \nHARRY (to himself) I'd sure like to open it and see. \nON HARRY -- those cold, intelligent eyes. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON PRINTER, TYPING: \"... 30 knots -- ETD -- 00:19 min\" \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY \nCLOSE ON -- Norman and Barnes. \nBARNES Don't get hysterical, Norman. \nNORMAN I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us. \nBARNES Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant. \nNORMAN All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him. \nBARNES Just worry about yourself. \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nBarnes on the phone with the surface.  Ted talking to him anyway... \nTED Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed. \nBARNES (into phone) What?  No, I know they're civilians... \nINT.  LIVING QUARTERS \nON NORMAN -- gathering his things.  Stuffing his shotty dufflebag. \nBeth, at her bunk, doing the same. \nNorman stands up.  Looks at the bunk above him: unpacked clothes, unpacked belongings, a notebook lying there saying: PROPERTY OF DR. HARRY ADAMS. \nON NORMAN -- panicking, looking around for Harry. \nCUT TO: \nBACK IN -- COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nBARNES (into phone) ... I said send the subs down, damn it! \nBarnes out the door, Ted at his heels... \nTED Did you hear me, sir, because -- \nBARNES Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now! \nON NORMAN -- running at them... \nNORMAN Harry's missing. \nBARNES What do you mean, he's missing? \nNORMAN He's missing.  He's gone.  He left. \nBARNES He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way. (they look at him) Go!  C'mon! \nNorman runs off.  Barnes storms down the hall... \nBARNES How can he be missing? \nTED Sir, about leaving -- \nBARNES We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside! \nINT.

Begins to open. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nDark.  Ted, Beth, and Barnes wander throughout. \nTED What the hell happened? \nThe lights flicker back on. \nBARNES They switched us over. \nTED To what? \nFLETCHER Squid... \nHarry stops mid-chew.  Frightened. \nFLETCHER ... there was a whole flock of them out there earlier.  It's strange. It's dead down here, and then all of a sudden -- \nHarry drops his fork.  He begins COUGHING.  HACKING.  CHOKING loudly. GAGGING.  He HACKS out the squid from his mouth... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HABITAT CORRIDOR \nA long, empty corridor.  All is quiet. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON A MONITOR -- a series of numbers: \nNORMAN When did it come across? \nEDMUNDS Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now. \nNORMAN Where's it coming from? \nEDMUNDS No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater. \nNORMAN Is it coming from our own computer? \nEDMUNDS Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this. \nEXT.

It'll take a minute. \nNORMAN Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish. (sits on the table) Harry, what happened in the cafeteria? \nHARRY Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish. \nNORMAN You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die. \nHARRY Did I? \nNORMAN You don't remember that? \nHARRY I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine. (beat) Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic. \nINT.

They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky. \nTED She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that. \nBARNES Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood? \nFLETCHER (O.S.) They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs. \nBARNES Fletcher, I want you back here. \nCUT TO: \nBACK IN -- LIVING QUARTERS \nNorman sitting on the table... \nNORMAN What happened to you inside that sphere, Harry? \nA long beat.

(beat) I thought you should know. \nBARNES So you knew this when you wrote your report? \nNORMAN At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break. \nBARNES You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation -- \nNORMAN Wait a second -- \nBARNES -- and then brought her down here -- \nNORMAN -- I didn't know it would come to this -- \nBARNES -- without a cautionary word to anyone. (beat) You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, \"When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy.\" \nON NORMAN -- sweating. \nCUT TO: \nON THE MONITOR -- a series of numbers: \nHARRY It's the same as before, but the spacing's different now.  It's definitely nonrandom.  See... \nHarry sitting at the monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, and Edmunds a PRINTOUT of the screan -- indicating a pattern. \nHARRY It's a single sequence repeated over and over. \nBARNES We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it? \nTED Maybe it's a message? \nEDMUNDS From what? \nTED The sphere.  Maybe the sphere -- \nEDMUNDS We're not hooked up to the sphere. \nHARRY Well, if it's a discharge -- \nTED It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message. \nBARNES From the sphere? \nTED What's inside the sphere. \nHARRY If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it. \nTED Yeah, I'll work on it, too. \nBARNES (to Ted, flat) You do that. \nINT.  BATHROOM/SHOWER AREA \nTed, nervous, anxious -- with five or six printouts in his hand -- has Norman's ear in front of the sink... \nTED He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things. \nNORMAN Like what? \nTed hands him a printout... \nTED It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation. \nNORMAN You mean a picture? \nTED Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light. (Norman does) Go ahead.  Squint at it. \nNORMAN I don't see anything. \nTED Squint harder. \nNORMAN Please, Ted. \nTED (hands him another printout) Try this one. \nNORMAN This is like nursery school. \nTED Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature. \nNORMAN The creature? \nTED Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know? \nON NORMAN -- Ted's lost it. \nNORMAN Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with? \nTED Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that \"someone went to a lot of trouble, try again\" bullshit.  And \"impotent\".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON MONITOR -- spirals now. \nHARRY ... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code? \nTED (to Norman) See?  No code.  What'd I say? \nHARRY Codes are for hiding information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it... \nNORMAN That's brilliant. \nTed grimaces at Norman. \nHARRY ... spiralling out of the center, you see: \"G\" is one, \"B\" is two, \"H\" is three, and so on... when I got the message. \nBARNES What's the message? \nHARRY I have to tell you.  It's strange. \nBARNES How do you mean, strange? \nHarry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads: \nHARRY \"Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What is your name?  My name is Jerry.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY \nBarnes walks briskly down the hall, Norman with him... \nBARNES He translated it wrong.  \"My name is Jerry\"?  It's like \"See Spot run.\" \nNORMAN The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you. \nHarry: \"No\" \n\"You are a many entity?\" \n\"No.  We are many separate entities.\" \n\"I understand.  Is there one control entity?\" \nBARNES What? \nHARRY He's saying, \"Take me to your leader.\" He wants to know who's in charge. \nBARNES I'm in charge. \n\"Yes.  The control entity is Captain Harald Barnes\" \nBARNES With an \"o\".  Harold with an \"o\". \nHARRY What -- you want me to retype it? \nHarry: \"Who are you?\" \n\"I am one\" \n\"Where are you from?\" \n\"I am here\" \n\"Where is the location from where you began?\" \nTED \"From where you began?\" That's not even good English. \n\"I am from AWARENESS\" \nBARNES What is that, a planet? \n\"Where is AWARENESS?\" \n\"AWARENESS is\" \n\"Did you make a journey?\" \n\"Yes.  Did you make a journey?\" \n\"Yes\" \n\"I make a journey.  You make a journey.  We make a journey together.  I am Happy.\" \nBARNES Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons. \nNORMAN That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence. \nBARNES You don't think weapons are important? \nNORMAN I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response. \nTED You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood? \nNORMAN When he uses a phrase like \"I am Happy\", I think we should think twice about what we ask him. \n\"Do Not Be Afraid\" \nThe all stare at the screen, stunned. \nNORMAN Jerry, can you understand what we're saying? \n\"Every word\" \nNorman walks up to the screen, close to it. \nNORMAN Jerry, can you read our minds? \n\"Yes Norman\" \nBarnes goes to the intercom... \nBARNES Edmunds, I want you in here.  Now. \nNorman focuses on the screen, staring. \nON THE SCREEN -- blank. \nNorman concentrating, on the screen. \nTHE SCREEN -- blank. \nNORMAN Jerry, are you there? \n\"Yes, Norman\" \nBARNES We shouldn't talk here.  Shut it off. \n\"I do not wish to Intrude\" \nNORMAN We would like to talk alone. \n\"I do not agree.  That is not possible.  I enjoy to talk with you.\" \nNORMAN And we enjoy talking with you. \n\"Let us talk now\" \nNORMAN We'd like to talk with you more.  We admire your talents and your great power and understanding. \n\"Thank you\" \nNORMAN And in your great understanding, you know that we are entities who must talk in private -- with each other. \n\"Do Not Be Afraid\" \nNORMAN We're not afraid, we are uncomfortable. \n\"Am I offended you?\" \nNORMAN Not at all, we enjoy you very much, but we need to talk alone, without you listening. \n\"I shall oblige\" \nNORMAN Thank you. \n\"But I am Not Happy\" \nNORMAN Jerry?... \n\"We'll be Right Back after a short break for these Messages from our Sponsor\" \nNORMAN Has Harry spoken with Jerry? \nTED Not that I know of.  Why? \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nNorman and Ted at the console... \nNORMAN Jerry? \nNo reply. \nNORMAN Jerry, are you there? \nNo reply. \nTED You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there? \nNORMAN I'm not sure. \nINT.  LABRATORY \nCLOSE ON AN EGG \nBeth, scalpel in hand, is making an incision into the shell. \nBETH Looking at the coating here, it's definitely marine invertebrate. \nBarnes, Norman, Harry and Ted stand around the table. \nBARNES Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood? \nTED What was Edmunds doing outside? \nBARNES Resetting the sub. \nTED What sub? \nBARNES In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the \"delay\" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes. \nNORMAN What for? \nBARNES If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened. \nNORMAN At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring. \nON THE EGG -- splitting open.  A slimy pinkish-brown FLUID oozes out.  A FETUS underneath. \nThey cover their mouths from the smell. \nBARNES What is it? \nBeth picks at it with forceps... \nBETH I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it. \nBARNES You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something. \nBeth glares at Barnes... \nINT.  CLOSET AREA -- DARK \nBeth, holding a piece of paper in her hand, pulls Norman inside, pressing on him... \nBETH ... He lied to us.  He left us down here. \nNORMAN C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back. \nBETH Yeah, he told you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out. \nNORMAN So what? \nBETH So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody. \nNORMAN You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up -- \nBETH Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here... \nShe shows him the printout in her hand, putting a flashlight on the words, reads... \nBETH \"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN.\" \nNORMAN Where did you get this? \nBETH In Edmunds' things. \nNORMAN You went through Edmunds' things? \nBETH He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon. \nNORMAN Calm down, Beth.  Alright? \nBETH Don't tell me to calm down! \nNORMAN It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay? \nHe turns to leave... \nBETH You said something to him, didn't you? \nNORMAN What? \nBETH You told him about me? \nON NORMAN -- pausing, staring at her... \nNORMAN Beth -- \nBETH You did, didn't you? \nNORMAN Don't do this. \nBETH You bastard. \nNORMAN Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright? \nShe looks at him, piercing into his eyes... \nBETH Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman. \nNORMAN Beth -- \nBETH No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm. \nNorman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him... \nTHE MONITORS blink: \"I AM COMING\".  The monitor blinks to BLANK. \nBARNES What the hell? (bangs on the monitors) It shut us down. \nNORMAN Jerry?  Please.  Stop this. \nBARNES Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions. \nTed goes out the door. \nALL THE MONITORS -- blank. \nBETH Where is it? \nBARNES Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here? \nThey HEAR a metallic CLANKING. \nBETH What was that? \nBARNES He's right beneath us. \nTHE MONITORS blink: \"I AM HERE\". \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LABRATORY \nHarry looking at the FETUS on the table.  It suddenly SLIDES down the table. \nThe room is rocked. \nON SHELVES -- Jars, petry dishes, test tubes SLIDE off shattering to the floor. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nBANG! \nTED is thrown ruthlessly against the wall.  His HEAD striking metal, splitting open his forehead. \nTHE WALLS -- CRACKING and GROANING. \nWATER breaks through a crack, spreading out onto the floor. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nBarnes... \nBARNES Ted?  Ted? \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM \nTed, stumbles, reaches for the headset... \nTED Sir, we're leaking! \nBlood dripping from his forehead. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nBARNES Increase positive pressure! \nBETH That's our reserve air. \nBARNES It's either that or we grow gills. \nBANG!  They grip onto the console... \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM \nTed, drousy, BLOOD gushing from his head, keeping balance, searches for the PRESSURE GAGE. \nBARNES (O.S.) Ted?  Ted, are you with me? \nFinds the GAGE.  Turns it. \nTED Increasing positive pressure. \nEXT.  HABITAT -- UNDERWATER \nAIR BUBBLES burst out of the walls. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nON THE FLOOR -- the WATER scurrying back through the leaks in the wall. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nBarnes, watching the monitors. \nBARNES That's enough Ted. (beat) Shut it off! \nINT.  CONTROL RROM \nTHE PRESSURE GAGE -- the needle RISING... \nON THE HEADSET -- in the air, dangling from it's cord. \nBARNES (O.S.) Ted?  Ted! \nON TED -- passed out on the floor.  Blood covering his face. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nBeth and Norman BOLT out the door \nINTO THE HALLWAY \nRunning.  BANG!  They're thrown against the wall. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM \nTHE PRESSURE GAUGE -- rising, higher, higher. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nTHUMP!  Norman and Beth, losing their balance, stumbling to their feet, running... \nON TED -- SLIDING out of the Control Room, down the corridor, taken by the water. \nBeth grabs him, as Norman stumbles \nINTO THE CONTROL ROOM \nfinds the PRESSURE GAGE, shuts it off. \nON BETH -- cold, turns away. \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nFIRE blasts out from the wall... \nBETH and NORMAN (still with Ted) wearing GAS MASKS, RUSH into the room... \nBETH Stay low! \nBeth sprays WHITE FOAM on the fierce FLAMES, licking up the side padding, smoke boils to the cieling. \nBANG!  The room is rocked. \nNORMAN It won't stop. \nNorman falls to the floor, losing Ted. \nTED -- SLIDES away and UNDER the computer CONSOLE. \nBANG!  The computer CONSOLE breaks -- COMPUTERS, MONITORS, fall, CRUSHING on Ted's legs.  He SCREAMS out in agony. \nNORMAN scrambles towards him through the smoke when... \nTHE CONSOLE catches fire, erupts in flame.  Ted underneath it. \nBETH -- her extinguisher out of foam. \nNORMAN -- runs to a wall, finds an EXTINGUISHER CASING, it's been bent, can't get it open. \nTED -- reaches out in desperation as his LEGS catch fire. \nTED Norman! \nNORMAN -- BASHES the casing in with his shoulder, grabs the extinguisher, turns... \nTED -- his entire body on fire. \nBANG!  Norman falls, dropping the extinguisher -- it rolls across the floor.  He reaches out -- can't get it. \nCLOSE ON TED -- his face burning... \nTED Norman!  Nor-- \nBANG!  The lights go out. \nDARKNESS \nNORMAN -- watches in horror as he watches TED, lit in flame, burning to death. \nNORMAN -- reaches for the wall for balance, grabs METAL, and he's ELECTRICUTED.  Falls backward, head first, and EVERYTHING GOES... \nBLACK \nA long beat. \nNAVY SEAMAN (O.S.) Dr. Johnson?  Dr. Johnson? \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nWE FOCUS in on Norman, as he awakens.  NAVY SEAMAN, 40s, African- American, standing above him. \nNAVY SEAMAN Norman Johnson. \nNORMAN Does this mean what I think it means? \nNAVY SEAMAN It's over, sir, The storm has cleared. \nNORMAN The ships? \nNAVY SEAMAN (O.S.) They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir. \nThe Navy Seaman helps Norman to his feet.  Norman is smiling, it's over. \nINT.  HALLWAY \nNorman and the Navy Seaman walk down the hall. \nNORMAN How are the others? \nNAVY SEAMAN The others, sir? \nNORMAN Beth and Harry? \nNAVY SEAMAN They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting. \nNorman sighs, smiling.  The relief, the jubilation. \nNORMAN That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier... \nNAVY SEAMAN What was that, sir? \nNORMAN About the time paradox. (the Seaman nodding) How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- \nAs Norman looks up, the Navy Seaman, still walking and nodding, begins to slowly DISAPPEAR.  Disintigrating.  VANISHING before his eyes. \nNorman stops, looks around him.  He's gone. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nNorman watches on a monitor -- the VIDEO of him walking down the hall, the Navy Seaman walking next to him. \nNORMAN (O.S.) ... how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- \nON THE MONITOR -- the Seaman disappers. \nNorman stops tape.  Looks over at the MONITOR showing the SPHERE.  It is closed. \nTHE SCREEN goes BLACK.  Flashes up: \"Hello Norman\" \nNORMAN Jerry? \n\"Yes Norman\" \nNORMAN Jerry, did you create that man? \n\"The entity Navy Seaman was a Manifestation.  Did you have a Happy talk?\" \nNORMAN Jerry, are you manifesting what's destroying our habitat? \n\"Did you have a Happy talk?\" \nNORMAN Jerry, answer me. \n\"No.\" \nA VIDEO SCREEN with the choices: \"DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... \" \nTHUMP! \nThe sub slightly SWAYS. \nNorman sits still, nervous. \nTHUMP!  Harder this time. \nNorman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD.  Sweating.  Can't see anything in here. \nBANG!  It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth.  He grips the seat. \nNORMAN Beth!  Beth!  There's something -- ! \nTHUMP!  BANG!  He's thrown around in the sub.  He can't see anything, tosses around.  He reaches for the doorhandle. \nBANG!  He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  The Sub almost turns over on it's side. \nNORMAN Beth!  Shit! \nHis HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.  Water SPLASHING up from below. \nThen, EVERYTHING stops. \nThe sub SWAYS to a still.  He sits quietly.  Waiting.  Listening. \nReaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out. \nStands on top of the sub.  Keeping balance.  He looks around, finds a DOOR inside the dome.  Tries to open it.  Locked. \nLooks around.  Nothing else.  Looks down at the water.  Can he risk it? His BREATHING short. \nNORMAN Beth?  Can you hear me? \nNo reply.  He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  Grimacing. Then, cautiously slips down into the water... \nEXT.  UNDERWATER \nCLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.  Looking everywhere.  Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  Lands on the bottom. \nHis LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.  Shortness of BREATH. \nHe walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  The DARK WATER.  Can't see anything.  Scared to death. \nNORMAN Beth?  Beth?  Shit. \nTHE HABITAT -- ahead of him. \nNorman goes to a STANCHION.  Grips onto it.  Twists around.  Looking. Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster. Barely BREATHING. \nHARRY (O.S.) ... you there?  Norman? \nNORMAN Harry? \nHARRY (O.S.) Norman, where are you? \nNORMAN I can't breathe...  Am I... clear? \nHARRY (O.S.) You're clear.  You see the airlock? \nNorman, twists around, and as he does... \nA SEA SNAKE \nHISSES at his faceplate.  Norman SCREAMS. \nON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go. \nHARRY (O.S.) Norman! \nNorman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION, slithering between the grid-like posts. \nTHE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom. Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him. It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  Norman backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when... \nNORMAN is whisked up. \nHARRY has him by the collar of his suit.  Taking him up. \nINT.  AIRLOCK \nThey burst out of the water.  Harry throws Norman onto the floor. Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nNorman, panting, walks with Harry... \nNORMAN Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it -- \nHARRY What happened to her? \nNORMAN What do you mean?  She's not here? \nHARRY When I woke up, nobody was here. \nNORMAN She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me. \nHARRY Her suit's gone. \nNORMAN Beth left? \nHARRY I thought she was with you. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nNorman and Harry at the mic... \nBETH (O.S.) ... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship. \nNORMAN What are you doing in the ship? (beat) Beth? \nBETH (O.S.) Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad. \nNORMAN Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me. \nBETH (O.S.) Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me. \nNORMAN He what? \nHarry shakes his head: \"no way\". \nBETH (O.S.) When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship. \nHARRY I never said that. \nNORMAN \"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids... \nBETH Squids? \nNORMAN \"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster.\" \nHe looks up from the book, realizing something... \nBETH Norman? \nSNAPS the book closed. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LIVING QUARTERS \nCLOSE ON HARRY'S DUFFLEBAG -- Norman rifles through notebooks.  Turning pages. \nTEARS off the first Jerry transmission. \nBeth, standing at the doorway, keeping watch down the hall. \nBETH Norman, what is it? \nNorman grabs Harry's YELLOW PAD OF PAPER. \nCUT TO: \nTHEIR FEET -- scurrying through the water soaked corridor. \nNorman ushers her into the Control Room.  Looks around.  SHUTS the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM \nNorman SCRIBBLES on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of paper... \nNORMAN After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him. \nBETH Manifested? \nNORMAN Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, \"Stop calling me Jerry\".  And -- \nNorman stops, staring at the pad. \nNORMAN He translated it wrong. \nBETH What? \nNorman picks up the pad of paper, reads... \nNORMAN Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What is your name?...  My name is Harry. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nHarry is walking towards the Living Quarters... \nNORMAN (O.S.) Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say \"Harry\", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry. \nBETH (O.S.) What do you mean, a part of Harry? \nBACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM \nNORMAN When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere. \nBETH You think, in the sphere -- \nNORMAN He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things. \nBETH But how? \nNORMAN I don't know. \nBETH How can the sphere do that? \nNORMAN I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid... \nBETH Which I told Barnes was attacking -- \nNORMAN It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real. \nBETH But why is he doing it? \nNORMAN He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream. \nBETH His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you? \nNORMAN (shaking his head) No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible? (off her look) It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are. \nCUT TO: \nIN -- THE LIVING QUARTERS \nIt's dark.  Harry lies on his bunk, asleep. \nBETH (O.S.) And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested. \nNORMAN (O.S.) Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control. \nHarry opens his eyes, stares at us. \nWE BEGIN TO HEAR A LOW INSISTENT BEEPING... \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nON SCREEN -- a transmission comes across... \n\"CQX VDX MOP LKI... \" \nBeth and Norman watch... \nNORMAN Looks like some sort of code. \nBETH Why would Harry go back to using a code? \nHARRY (O.S.) You mean Jerry, don't you? \nHarry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room. \nBETH Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I? \nHARRY That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth. \nNORMAN And whatever it is, it's not coming from Harry. \nNorman looks at the monitors: \nON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN.  It's Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat. \nThe Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES.  The lettering on the boxes isn't in focus. \nNorman squints at the MONITOR -- can't make it out. \nNORMAN Beth?  What is that?  What are you doing? \nThe Sub's CLAW ARMS drops one of the BOXES, plumping it softly on the muddy floor. \nNORMAN Can you hear me?  Beth?  Can you copy? Get inside, there's something out there. \nON ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub moves forward.  Churning up the sediment. It stops again, and releases another box. \nNorman BANGS on the headset. \nNORMAN Damn it, Beth, I know you hear me. \nTHE MONITORS blink: \"I AM COMING FOR YOU\" \nON NORMAN -- breathing heavy. \nNORMAN What the hell? \nANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub in view -- a closer view.  It releases it's last box.  Norman can read the lettering now: \"CAUTION: TEVAC EXPLOSIVES\" \nNORMAN Beth?  C'mon.  What are you -- ? \nTHE MONITORS flash: \"I WILL KILL YOU\" \nNORMAN Oh shit. \nNorman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET. Searching for tapes.  Another cabinet.  Then another. \nA shelf labled: \"SPHERE\" -- all the tapes are gone. \nNORMAN It's her. \nTHE MONITORS flash: \"I WILL KILL YOU\" \nON THE HEADSET -- resting on the console.  WE HEAR faintly... \nBETH (O.S.) Norman?  Norman? \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nNorman pushes Harry and his IV down the corridor.  Hurrying.  An inch or two of water on the floor. \nINT.  LIVING QUARTERS \nCLOSE ON A METAL CASE -- labled: \"Captain Harold Barnes.\" \nNorman BANGS it against the wall, trying to bust the LOCK.  BANGING. BANGING.  Breaks the lock.  Digs inside the case. \nPulls out a GUN. \nINT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR \nNorman pushing Harry and the IV stand.  Wheels him into... \nBATHROOM/SINK AREA \nNorman stops.  Turns off the main lights.  The room goes dark.  The florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on. \nNorman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall.  Checks the IV. \nNorman goes to a STALL.  Steps inside.  Keeps the stall door open.  Can still see Harry about 10 feet away. \nNorman looks at the GUN.  COCKS it.  Pinches his finger. \nNORMAN Ouch. \nHe waits.  Listening. \nA FAINT HIGH-PITCHED HISSING SOUND \nNorman looks over at the sinks. \nA FAUCET is on.  Water HISSING faintly from it. \nNorman ignores it.  Waiting in the dark.  Listening. \nON THE FAUCET -- the water running. \nON NORMAN -- looking at it.  Can't ignore it.  Tries.  But can't. \nNorman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor. \nOVER TO THE SINKS \nThe light above them on.  Norman turns the faucet off.  The water stops. \nBut the HISSING SOUND remains. \nNorman looks at the faucet, queerly.  Turns it back on.  Then off. \nThe HISSING SOUND still there.  It isn't the water. \nNorman looks down at his feet... \nTHE FLOOR -- seems to be moving.  Something swimming in the water. \nCLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up inside his pantleg, HISSING.  His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly slides up past his knee. \nHISSING LOUDER \nAs more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall. \nNORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt. \nAnother SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman, sliding up around his neck. \nWE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COME FROM DOWN THE HALL \nNORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides, slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin, over his face.  Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING. \nBETH (O.S.) What time is it, Norman? \nNORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her jumpsuit. \nBETH Do you know the time? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  AIRLOCK \n... His head BURSTS above the water level, BIG BREATH.  GASPING.  He flails his arms over to the ladder.  Grips the ladder, but his hands are like ice.  Can't hold it.  He slips. \nFlailing in the water. \nHe HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM.  Twists his legs around, out of the water, and flops his body onto the deck. \nShivering. \nTries to get up.  Falls over.  His body shaking.  His lips purple.  His eyes barely open, looking at... \nHIS JUMPSUIT -- hanging on the wall. \nNorman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.

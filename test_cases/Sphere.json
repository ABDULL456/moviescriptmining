{"train": "\"Sphere\", early draft, by Stephen Hauser \nSPHERE \nby Stephen Hauser \nbased on the novel, SPHERE, by Michael Crichton \nMarch 5, 1996 \nEXT.  STREET IN GEORGETOWN -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT \nFog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.  Apartment buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.  In one building, six floors up, a bedroom light is on.  WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE looking out the window. \nWIFE (O.S.) What kind of a crash was it? \nNORMAN (O.S.) You seen my suitcase? \nWIFE (O.S.) There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline? \nNORMAN (O.S.) He didn't say much at all.  Honey -- \nWIFE (O.S.) In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you? \nNORMAN (O.S.) Don't be so supportive, honey. \nWIFE (O.S.) Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment -- \nNORMAN (O.S.) Four.  Four years -- \nWIFE (O.S.) Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume. \nNORMAN (O.S.) Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news? \nWIFE (O.S.) How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus? \nA tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front of the apartment building.  A U.S.  NAVY decal is on the door. \nWIFE (O.S.) There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman. \nNORMAN (O.S.) What? \nWIFE (O.S.) Was it a military crash? \nNORMAN (O.S.) I don't know. \nWIFE (O.S.) They never used to send a Navy car. \nCUT TO: \nTHE LOUD, HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER \nEXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY \nBlinding sunlight, as the helicopter WHIPS by, speeding above the Pacific Ocean. \nINT.  HELICOPTER -- DAY \nNorman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back.  He studies a pamphlet in his hand: \"AIRCRASH SURVIVAL: HOW TO COPE\".  The PILOT, in the cockpit, turns to him. \nPILOT What kinda work you in, Dr. Johnson? \nNorman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag. \nNORMAN I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while. (beat) I treat aircrash survivors. \nPILOT Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson. \nNORMAN You've heard of me? \nPILOT Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote. \nNORMAN What report? \nPILOT Huh? \nNORMAN What report? \nPILOT You mean you don't know? \nNORMAN Know what? \nThe pilot glances back at him again. \nPILOT Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight. \nNORMAN Who's everyone? \nPILOT Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it. \nNORMAN Geologists?  At a plane crash? \nPILOT Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less. \nNORMAN What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash? \nNorman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the water. \nEXT.  SHIP DECK -- DAY \nThe helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.  A young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter. \nShe looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag. \nOFFICER Any other bags, Dr. Johnson? \nNORMAN Just that.  Careful, it's heavy. \nShe lugs it over her shoulder, no problem. \nOFFICER No other equipment?  Scientific instruments? \nNORMAN No, they didn't say -- \nOFFICER This way, sir. \nNorman follows the officer away from the helipad. \nINT.  SHIP \nShe leads Norman down a flight of stairs. \nOFFICER Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir. \nNORMAN Captain who? \nThe hatch door LOCKS, loudly.  The sub lurches, and begins descending. \nTED Pussy. \nBETH What's that -- mistake number two, Norman? \nNORMAN He wasn't feeling well. \nTED He's a pussy. \nHarry is still staring at Norman... \nHARRY How are you feeling, Norman? \nNORMAN What? \nHARRY You holding up alright? \nNORMAN Fine.  I'm fine. \nHARRY Don't be defensive. \nNORMAN I'm not being defensive. \nHARRY You sound defensive. \nNORMAN I'm fine. \nTED (to Harry) What'd you say to him? \nHARRY To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know. \nTED What does Norman already know? \nHARRY Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake. \nNorman looks over at Beth. \nHARRY She told me what you said, Norman. \nTED What is it, Harry? \nHARRY Just one of Norman's many secrets. \nON NORMAN, saying nothing. \nEXT.  OCEAN \nWE SEE the sub descending into darker waters. \nEXT.  DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK \nThe SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal.  Around it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights. \nINT.  AIRLOCK -- PRESSURIZING ROOM \nCLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking. \nOFFICER (O.S.) One moment for pressurizing. \nA SOFT WHIRR. \nANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the small, claustrophobic pressurizing room.  Like sardines.  Nobody says anything.  A long beat. \nTHE DOOR \nin front of them, opens.  TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, a big-boned female officer, stands before them.  She wears a black plastic PAD, a \"talker\", around her neck. \nShe hands each member their own \"talker\".  Norman takes his. \nINT.  DH-8 HALLWAY \nFletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway.  Each of them wears the \"talkers\" around their necks. \nBARNES They pressurize us with helium. \nNORMAN What's wrong with oxygen? \nBARNES It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile. \nTED Important safety tip.  Thanks Captain. \nFletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to Barnes... \nFLETCHER Captain, the divers have the airlock mounted at the door.  The robot is now in position to enter the spacecraft. \nTED Robot?  What robot? \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nCLOSE ON A MONITOR -- showing the robot in front of the curved gray metal of the spacecraft. \nBARNES Edmunds, bring up the robot's camera feed. \nJANE EDMUNDS, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel.  Another MONITOR clicks on -- showing the robot's POV of the door. \nTED Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television. \nBARNES Nobody goes inside, until we know what's inside. \nON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans the spacecraft hull, stops on a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door. \nBARNES Can you open that panel? \nEDMUNDS Working on it now, sir. \nON THE MONITOR -- a robotic CLAW extends out to the panel.  Trying to pry the panel open. \nTED I'd like it noted in the report that I think we should be doing this ourselves.  Making a manned entry... \nThe claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal. \nTED I'd also like it noted -- \nBARNES Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction. \nON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber sucker.  It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck. \nEDMUNDS It's not sucking, sir. \nBARNES Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else. \nEDMUNDS We don't have anything else to try, Sir. \nBARNES Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up -- \nIn the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft, WE SEE a tunnel -- cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs. \nINT.  TUNNEL \nAbout 60 feet deep.  Narrower than they'd like.  Norman descends, clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to the coral walls. \nTHE LOUD HISSING OF AIR \nINT.  SPACECRAFT AIRLOCK \nCLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE as he watches the water recede, down past his faceplate. \nTHE LOUD BANGING OF METAL \nTed has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a sledgehammer. \nHARRY Easy Ted, we're not mining gold. \nTED Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space. \nThey all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted keeps swinging. \nBETH Looks alot like an airplane door, doesn't it? \nTed stops and looks at the door. \nTED Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't... \nHARRY Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering. \nNORMAN You want me to try? \nTED You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do? \nBARNES Give him the hammer, Ted. \nNorman takes the hammer.  Walks up to the wedge.  Gets his bearings. Rears back... then stops. \nTED What is it, your back give out? \nSomething has caught Norman's eye.  He looks down at the wedge. \nBARNES What is it, Norman? \nNORMAN Take a look. \nBarnes comes toward him.  The others follow.  Barnes bends down, looks closely down at the wedge in the door. \nBARNES It's chipped. \nHARRY Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped? \nBARNES I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped. \nHARRY I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash? \nBARNES I did. \nHARRY Then how can it be chipped? \nON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms, feels around. \nBETH There's heat coming the door. \nBARNES Back away then. \nBETH Wait a minute -- \nBARNES I said back away. \nBETH Would you wait a minute? \nTHE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE \nBarnes unstraps a GUN -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his buckle. \nBARNES Ted, get her away from the door. \nTED What are you going to do -- shoot her? \nThe RUMBLING louder... \nBARNES Get her away! \nTHE DOOR begins to slide open. \nBeth backs away. \nTHE DOOR, sliding, is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside.  The door stops, it's open, it's quiet.  They all stand there, looking at BLACKNESS.  A long beat. \nINT.  SPACECRAFT \nON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside.  His helmet light SHINES on the others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK, suspended high in the air. \nMetallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them. \nNorman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40 feet of darkness, dimly lighting the LOWER HULL, a dense network of STRUTS and GIRDERS. \nTED Look at this. \nBARNES What is it? \nTed SPOTLIGHTS the OUTER HULL. \nTED Some sort of lead or something. \nBARNES Radiation shield, you think? \nTED A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation. \nBeth's light SHINES down onto the CATWALK.  WE SEE FOOTPRINTS outlined on the dusty floor. \nBETH Hold on -- \nBARNES What is it? \nBETH Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up? \nTED No.  I don't think so. \nBETH Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine. \nTED Well, they're not mine. \nON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large, like the boots they're wearing. \nBARNES What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back? \nTED Maybe we didn't want to come back. \nBACK IN -- THE ROOM \nNorman, Harry, and Beth... \nBETH What are you looking for? \nHARRY A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power. \nON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS. \nBETH What's that noise? \nThey LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE. \nNORMAN Sounds a little like water -- \nSUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him -- sucking him inside... \nBETH Norman! \nNORMAN Get this thing off me. \nBeth bends down, presses a button, the CHAIR releases Norman... \nBETH I think the chair thinks you want to fly this thing. \nON BETH's FACEPLATE -- as she's looking down -- WE BEGIN TO SEE -- reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering across... \n\"RV-LHOOQ... DCOM1... \" \nHer EYES look up slowly... as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE BLACK SCREEN in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow lettering: \n\"RV -- LHOOQ -- DCOMl -- U.S.S STAR VOYAGER\" \n\"ASSIMILATING DATABASE\" as a series of numbers race upwards in count... \nAnd the desk in front of them LIGHTS UP, a control panel coming to life. \nHARRY Nice work, Norman. \nNORMAN Whatever I can do to help. \nON THE SCREEN as it changes, now filled with columns: \nSHIP SYSTEMS DATA SYSTEMS QUARTER MASTER FLIGHT RECORDS \nHarry punches some keys on the control panel. \nHARRY A flight recorder.  Our future is about to be seen in our present. \nON THE SCREEN as it changes: \nFLIGHT DATA SUMMARIES FDS 01/01/47-12/31/49 FDS 01/01/50-12/31/52 FDS 01/01/53-12/31/55 FDS 01/01/56-12/31/56 FDS 01/01/56-02/01/56 FDS 02/02/56-UNKNOWN ENTRY EVENT \nNORMAN 01-01-47.  Two thousand-forty seven. 50 years in our future. \nHARRY Unknown Entry Event. \nHarry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys... \nON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving... WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the illusion of depth. \nThe IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like we're flying through it. \nThe stars and other space matter streaking by. \nBETH What's that cluster of stars there? In the center? \nHarry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image... \nHARRY Our answer. \nNORMAN To what? \nHARRY Time travel.  A black hole. \nThe CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer and closer, brightening. \nThe FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole. \nON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS: \nHARRY (O.S.) Ted?  Captain? \nBARNES (O.S.) Yes, Harry. \nHARRY (O.S.) We know how this craft got here. Where it's been. \nBARNES (O.S.) So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels. \nSTILL ON NORMAN -- frightened... \nNORMAN Picked up something?  What is it? \nBARNES (O.S.) I don't know.  But it's something alien. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CARGO BAY \nANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance.  AS WE PAN UP and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly swirling green and blue fluids.  Like mercury.  Mesmerizlng. \nAS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top. \nThey walk around it, circling it, looking up at it. \nHARRY This answers one of our questions. \nNORMAN Which one?  Let me get the list out. \nHARRY This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... sphere.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home. \nNORMAN But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past. \nHARRY Our present. \nBARNES But what does it do?  This... sphere. \nNORMAN Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone. \nHARRY Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone. \nNorman gets out of his bed. \nNORMAN I can't believe that, Harry. \nHARRY Gimme another explanation. \nNorman pacing. \nNORMAN I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong. \nHARRY Am I? \nNORMAN Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight. \nHARRY You mean, you think I'm cracking? \nNORMAN No.  I didn't say that. \nHARRY Then what, Norman? \nNorman stops pacing, a beat. \nNORMAN It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you. \nHARRY Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nCLOSE ON MONITOR: Video of the sphere.  RAPIDLY rewinding. \nBARNES What caused it? \nEDMUNDS Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all. \nHARRY When did it happen? \nEDMUNDS Seconds ago.  Here! \nPLAYBACK: WE SEE the sphere -- idle.  Nothing around it.  Then it's DOOR slowly OPENS, revealing BLACKNESS inside.  A beat.  And then it closes. \nBARNES Let me see that again. \nEdmunds plays it again.  This time... \nWE MOVE IN ON HARRY, staring at the monitor. \nHARRY (to himself) I'd sure like to open it and see. \nON HARRY -- those cold, intelligent eyes. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON PRINTER, TYPING: \"... 30 knots -- ETD -- 00:19 min\" \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY \nCLOSE ON -- Norman and Barnes. \nBARNES Don't get hysterical, Norman. \nNORMAN I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us. \nBARNES Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant. \nNORMAN All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him. \nBARNES Just worry about yourself. \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nBarnes on the phone with the surface.  Ted talking to him anyway... \nTED Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed. \nBARNES (into phone) What?  No, I know they're civilians... \nINT.  LIVING QUARTERS \nON NORMAN -- gathering his things.  Stuffing his shotty dufflebag. \nBeth, at her bunk, doing the same. \nNorman stands up.  Looks at the bunk above him: unpacked clothes, unpacked belongings, a notebook lying there saying: PROPERTY OF DR. HARRY ADAMS. \nON NORMAN -- panicking, looking around for Harry. \nCUT TO: \nBACK IN -- COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nBARNES (into phone) ... I said send the subs down, damn it! \nBarnes out the door, Ted at his heels... \nTED Did you hear me, sir, because -- \nBARNES Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now! \nON NORMAN -- running at them... \nNORMAN Harry's missing. \nBARNES What do you mean, he's missing? \nNORMAN He's missing.  He's gone.  He left. \nBARNES He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way. (they look at him) Go!  C'mon! \nNorman runs off.  Barnes storms down the hall... \nBARNES How can he be missing? \nTED Sir, about leaving -- \nBARNES We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside! \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nEdmunds working the monitors, stops.  Seeing something on a screen. Staring in horror... \nBeth rushes by Ted, carrying bags to the door... \nBETH Norman?  Where's Norman? \nTED By the bunks. \nINT.  LIVING QUARTERS \nBeth running in... \nBETH Norman?... Norman? \nCan't see him anywhere. \nINTO THE BATHROOMS \nBETH Norman! \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nBARNES Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman? \nEDMUNDS (O.S.) Yes, sir. \nBARNES Well, where the fuck is he? \nEDMUNDS (O.S.) In the ship, sir. \nBarnes spins to see the monitor... \nBARNES What? \nON MONITOR -- Norman, in jumpsuit and helmet, running through the ship. \nBarnes slipping on headset mic... \nBARNES Norman?  Norman! \nINT.  SPACECRAFT \nNorman running across a catwalk... \nBARNES (O.S.) You get your ass back here.  You have no authority whatsoever to be in there.  You hear me?...  Norman?  Don't go hero on me now. \nCUT TO: \nPRINTER, TYPING: \"... ETD -- 00:05 min EVACUATION IMMINENT\" \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nEDMUNDS Sir, if the subs haven't left by now... \nBARNES (O.S.) They've left, keep watching! \nEDMUNDS Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening. \nON THE MONITOR -- the sphere door, slowly opening.  Revealing: BLACKNESS. \nBARNES (O.S.) Where is he?  Damn it!  Can you see him? \nA still moment and then Harry tumbles out the sphere, and falls to the ground. \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nBarnes, squinting at Harry on his monitor. \nBARNES (O.S.) How does he look?  Can you tell? \nHarry lies motionless. \nEDMUNDS (O.S.) He looks... dead, sir. \nON BETH -- in the hall, hearing that. \nINT.  SPACECRAFT \nNorman, running, blindly, through a hall, around corners... \nBARNES (O.S.) Norman, get out of there now! Norman? \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nEDMUNDS If the subs aren't here yet, sir -- \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nBarnes, into his headset. \nBARNES They'll be here.  Norman -- can you hear me?... \nINT.  SPACECRAFT \nON NORMAN -- running... \nBARNES (O.S.) You don't have time!  Get the hell out of -- \nBarnes' voice goes static, and cuts out. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nON THE MONITOR -- flickering, losing power... \nEDMUNDS Sir, we're losing it. \nON THE MONITOR -- flickering, fading, and all the lights and monitors SHUT DOWN. \nINT.  SPACECRAFT \nON HARRY -- lying still, face down under the sphere.  Goes to him. Checks Harry's LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  Still blinking -- he's still alive. Norman, pauses, looks up, staring at... \nTHE SPHERE \nMesmerizing.  He can see himself, reflected in the swirling mass, staring back at himself.  The door begins to open, closes.  Begins to open. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nDark.  Ted, Beth, and Barnes wander throughout. \nTED What the hell happened? \nThe lights flicker back on. \nBARNES They switched us over. \nTED To what? \nFLETCHER Squid... \nHarry stops mid-chew.  Frightened. \nFLETCHER ... there was a whole flock of them out there earlier.  It's strange. It's dead down here, and then all of a sudden -- \nHarry drops his fork.  He begins COUGHING.  HACKING.  CHOKING loudly. GAGGING.  He HACKS out the squid from his mouth... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HABITAT CORRIDOR \nA long, empty corridor.  All is quiet. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON A MONITOR -- a series of numbers: \nNORMAN When did it come across? \nEDMUNDS Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now. \nNORMAN Where's it coming from? \nEDMUNDS No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater. \nNORMAN Is it coming from our own computer? \nEDMUNDS Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this. \nEXT.  HABITAT -- UNDERWATER \nSWARMS of pretty, pink JELLYFISH.  Everywhere. \nFROM UNDER THE HABITAT -- Fletcher swims up to them with a net.  It's beautiful.  Eerie.  Almost idyllic. \nINT.  LIVING QUARTERS \nHarry, on his bunk with decoding papers in his hands, turns to Norman, entering the room. \nNORMAN Getting anywhere with those? \nHARRY There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute. \nNORMAN Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish. (sits on the table) Harry, what happened in the cafeteria? \nHARRY Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish. \nNORMAN You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die. \nHARRY Did I? \nNORMAN You don't remember that? \nHARRY I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine. (beat) Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nBeth, Ted, and Barnes watch... \nON A MONITOR -- Fletcher outside, with the jellyfish. \nBARNES (into the mic) Fletcher?  What are you doing out there? \nFLETCHER (O.S.) They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky. \nTED She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that. \nBARNES Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood? \nFLETCHER (O.S.) They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs. \nBARNES Fletcher, I want you back here. \nCUT TO: \nBACK IN -- LIVING QUARTERS \nNorman sitting on the table... \nNORMAN What happened to you inside that sphere, Harry? \nA long beat.  Harry becomes concerned... \nHARRY Why?  Does someone else want to go inside? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nON THE MONITOR -- Fletcher, the jellyfish clinging to her facemask, her suit... \nFLETCHER (O.S.) I can't see, they're smearing the faceplate.  My arms... the fabric... \nFletcher's suit tears... \nBARNES Fletcher, get away from there... \nFLETCHER (O.S.) It's burning... \nBARNES Get out of there! \nFLETCHER (O.S.) I can't see... \nBARNES Fletcher!  Now! \nFLETCHER (O.S.) I can't... \nON BETH -- bolting out of the room.  Barnes turning to her... \nBARNES Nobody move. \nBETH But she's -- \nBARNES Nobody move! \nFLETCHER (O.S.) They're eating through... Somebody -- \nCUT TO: \nON FLETCHER -- UNDERWATER -- jellyfish eating into her plastic faceplate... she's COUGHING, GASPING. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nThey watch... \nNORMAN '81, I think.  She tried again five years ago. (beat) I thought you should know. \nBARNES So you knew this when you wrote your report? \nNORMAN At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break. \nBARNES You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation -- \nNORMAN Wait a second -- \nBARNES -- and then brought her down here -- \nNORMAN -- I didn't know it would come to this -- \nBARNES -- without a cautionary word to anyone. (beat) You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, \"When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy.\" \nON NORMAN -- sweating. \nCUT TO: \nON THE MONITOR -- a series of numbers: \nHARRY It's the same as before, but the spacing's different now.  It's definitely nonrandom.  See... \nHarry sitting at the monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, and Edmunds a PRINTOUT of the screan -- indicating a pattern. \nHARRY It's a single sequence repeated over and over. \nBARNES We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it? \nTED Maybe it's a message? \nEDMUNDS From what? \nTED The sphere.  Maybe the sphere -- \nEDMUNDS We're not hooked up to the sphere. \nHARRY Well, if it's a discharge -- \nTED It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message. \nBARNES From the sphere? \nTED What's inside the sphere. \nHARRY If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it. \nTED Yeah, I'll work on it, too. \nBARNES (to Ted, flat) You do that. \nINT.  BATHROOM/SHOWER AREA \nTed, nervous, anxious -- with five or six printouts in his hand -- has Norman's ear in front of the sink... \nTED He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things. \nNORMAN Like what? \nTed hands him a printout... \nTED It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation. \nNORMAN You mean a picture? \nTED Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light. (Norman does) Go ahead.  Squint at it. \nNORMAN I don't see anything. \nTED Squint harder. \nNORMAN Please, Ted. \nTED (hands him another printout) Try this one. \nNORMAN This is like nursery school. \nTED Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature. \nNORMAN The creature? \nTED Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know? \nON NORMAN -- Ted's lost it. \nNORMAN Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with? \nTED Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that \"someone went to a lot of trouble, try again\" bullshit.  And \"impotent\".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON MONITOR -- spirals now. \nHARRY ... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code? \nTED (to Norman) See?  No code.  What'd I say? \nHARRY Codes are for hiding information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it... \nNORMAN That's brilliant. \nTed grimaces at Norman. \nHARRY ... spiralling out of the center, you see: \"G\" is one, \"B\" is two, \"H\" is three, and so on... when I got the message. \nBARNES What's the message? \nHARRY I have to tell you.  It's strange. \nBARNES How do you mean, strange? \nHarry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads: \nHARRY \"Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What is your name?  My name is Jerry.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY \nBarnes walks briskly down the hall, Norman with him... \nBARNES He translated it wrong.  \"My name is Jerry\"?  It's like \"See Spot run.\" \nNORMAN The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you. \nHarry: \"No\" \n\"You are a many entity?\" \n\"No.  We are many separate entities.\" \n\"I understand.  Is there one control entity?\" \nBARNES What? \nHARRY He's saying, \"Take me to your leader.\" He wants to know who's in charge. \nBARNES I'm in charge. \n\"Yes.  The control entity is Captain Harald Barnes\" \nBARNES With an \"o\".  Harold with an \"o\". \nHARRY What -- you want me to retype it? \nHarry: \"Who are you?\" \n\"I am one\" \n\"Where are you from?\" \n\"I am here\" \n\"Where is the location from where you began?\" \nTED \"From where you began?\" That's not even good English. \n\"I am from AWARENESS\" \nBARNES What is that, a planet? \n\"Where is AWARENESS?\" \n\"AWARENESS is\" \n\"Did you make a journey?\" \n\"Yes.  Did you make a journey?\" \n\"Yes\" \n\"I make a journey.  You make a journey.  We make a journey together.  I am Happy.\" \nBARNES Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons. \nNORMAN That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence. \nBARNES You don't think weapons are important? \nNORMAN I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response. \nTED You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood? \nNORMAN When he uses a phrase like \"I am Happy\", I think we should think twice about what we ask him. \n\"Do Not Be Afraid\" \nThe all stare at the screen, stunned. \nNORMAN Jerry, can you understand what we're saying? \n\"Every word\" \nNorman walks up to the screen, close to it. \nNORMAN Jerry, can you read our minds? \n\"Yes Norman\" \nBarnes goes to the intercom... \nBARNES Edmunds, I want you in here.  Now. \nNorman focuses on the screen, staring. \nON THE SCREEN -- blank. \nNorman concentrating, on the screen. \nTHE SCREEN -- blank. \nNORMAN Jerry, are you there? \n\"Yes, Norman\" \nBARNES We shouldn't talk here.  Shut it off. \n\"I do not wish to Intrude\" \nNORMAN We would like to talk alone. \n\"I do not agree.  That is not possible.  I enjoy to talk with you.\" \nNORMAN And we enjoy talking with you. \n\"Let us talk now\" \nNORMAN We'd like to talk with you more.  We admire your talents and your great power and understanding. \n\"Thank you\" \nNORMAN And in your great understanding, you know that we are entities who must talk in private -- with each other. \n\"Do Not Be Afraid\" \nNORMAN We're not afraid, we are uncomfortable. \n\"Am I offended you?\" \nNORMAN Not at all, we enjoy you very much, but we need to talk alone, without you listening. \n\"I shall oblige\" \nNORMAN Thank you. \n\"But I am Not Happy\" \nNORMAN Jerry?... \n\"We'll be Right Back after a short break for these Messages from our Sponsor\" \nNORMAN Has Harry spoken with Jerry? \nTED Not that I know of.  Why? \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nNorman and Ted at the console... \nNORMAN Jerry? \nNo reply. \nNORMAN Jerry, are you there? \nNo reply. \nTED You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there? \nNORMAN I'm not sure. \nINT.  LABRATORY \nCLOSE ON AN EGG \nBeth, scalpel in hand, is making an incision into the shell. \nBETH Looking at the coating here, it's definitely marine invertebrate. \nBarnes, Norman, Harry and Ted stand around the table. \nBARNES Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood? \nTED What was Edmunds doing outside? \nBARNES Resetting the sub. \nTED What sub? \nBARNES In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the \"delay\" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes. \nNORMAN What for? \nBARNES If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened. \nNORMAN At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring. \nON THE EGG -- splitting open.  A slimy pinkish-brown FLUID oozes out.  A FETUS underneath. \nThey cover their mouths from the smell. \nBARNES What is it? \nBeth picks at it with forceps... \nBETH I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it. \nBARNES You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something. \nBeth glares at Barnes... \nINT.  CLOSET AREA -- DARK \nBeth, holding a piece of paper in her hand, pulls Norman inside, pressing on him... \nBETH ... He lied to us.  He left us down here. \nNORMAN C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back. \nBETH Yeah, he told you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out. \nNORMAN So what? \nBETH So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody. \nNORMAN You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up -- \nBETH Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here... \nShe shows him the printout in her hand, putting a flashlight on the words, reads... \nBETH \"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN.\" \nNORMAN Where did you get this? \nBETH In Edmunds' things. \nNORMAN You went through Edmunds' things? \nBETH He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon. \nNORMAN Calm down, Beth.  Alright? \nBETH Don't tell me to calm down! \nNORMAN It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay? \nHe turns to leave... \nBETH You said something to him, didn't you? \nNORMAN What? \nBETH You told him about me? \nON NORMAN -- pausing, staring at her... \nNORMAN Beth -- \nBETH You did, didn't you? \nNORMAN Don't do this. \nBETH You bastard. \nNORMAN Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright? \nShe looks at him, piercing into his eyes... \nBETH Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman. \nNORMAN Beth -- \nBETH No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm. \nNorman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him... \nTHE MONITORS blink: \"I AM COMING\".  The monitor blinks to BLANK. \nBARNES What the hell? (bangs on the monitors) It shut us down. \nNORMAN Jerry?  Please.  Stop this. \nBARNES Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions. \nTed goes out the door. \nALL THE MONITORS -- blank. \nBETH Where is it? \nBARNES Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here? \nThey HEAR a metallic CLANKING. \nBETH What was that? \nBARNES He's right beneath us. \nTHE MONITORS blink: \"I AM HERE\". \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LABRATORY \nHarry looking at the FETUS on the table.  It suddenly SLIDES down the table. \nThe room is rocked. \nON SHELVES -- Jars, petry dishes, test tubes SLIDE off shattering to the floor. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nBANG! \nTED is thrown ruthlessly against the wall.  His HEAD striking metal, splitting open his forehead. \nTHE WALLS -- CRACKING and GROANING. \nWATER breaks through a crack, spreading out onto the floor. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nBarnes... \nBARNES Ted?  Ted? \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM \nTed, stumbles, reaches for the headset... \nTED Sir, we're leaking! \nBlood dripping from his forehead. \nINT.

CONTROL ROOM \nTed, drousy, BLOOD gushing from his head, keeping balance, searches for the PRESSURE GAGE. \nBARNES (O.S.) Ted?  Ted, are you with me? \nFinds the GAGE.  Turns it. \nTED Increasing positive pressure. \nEXT.  HABITAT -- UNDERWATER \nAIR BUBBLES burst out of the walls. \nINT.

Norman and Beth, losing their balance, stumbling to their feet, running... \nON TED -- SLIDING out of the Control Room, down the corridor, taken by the water. \nBeth grabs him, as Norman stumbles \nINTO THE CONTROL ROOM \nfinds the PRESSURE GAGE, shuts it off. \nON BETH -- cold, turns away. \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nFIRE blasts out from the wall... \nBETH and NORMAN (still with Ted) wearing GAS MASKS, RUSH into the room... \nBETH Stay low! \nBeth sprays WHITE FOAM on the fierce FLAMES, licking up the side padding, smoke boils to the cieling. \nBANG!  The room is rocked. \nNORMAN It won't stop. \nNorman falls to the floor, losing Ted. \nTED -- SLIDES away and UNDER the computer CONSOLE. \nBANG!  The computer CONSOLE breaks -- COMPUTERS, MONITORS, fall, CRUSHING on Ted's legs.  He SCREAMS out in agony. \nNORMAN scrambles towards him through the smoke when... \nTHE CONSOLE catches fire, erupts in flame.  Ted underneath it. \nBETH -- her extinguisher out of foam. \nNORMAN -- runs to a wall, finds an EXTINGUISHER CASING, it's been bent, can't get it open. \nTED -- reaches out in desperation as his LEGS catch fire. \nTED Norman! \nNORMAN -- BASHES the casing in with his shoulder, grabs the extinguisher, turns... \nTED -- his entire body on fire. \nBANG!  Norman falls, dropping the extinguisher -- it rolls across the floor.  He reaches out -- can't get it. \nCLOSE ON TED -- his face burning... \nTED Norman!  Nor-- \nBANG!  The lights go out. \nDARKNESS \nNORMAN -- watches in horror as he watches TED, lit in flame, burning to death. \nNORMAN -- reaches for the wall for balance, grabs METAL, and he's ELECTRICUTED.  Falls backward, head first, and EVERYTHING GOES... \nBLACK \nA long beat. \nNAVY SEAMAN (O.S.) Dr. Johnson?  Dr. Johnson? \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nWE FOCUS in on Norman, as he awakens.  NAVY SEAMAN, 40s, African- American, standing above him. \nNAVY SEAMAN Norman Johnson. \nNORMAN Does this mean what I think it means? \nNAVY SEAMAN It's over, sir, The storm has cleared. \nNORMAN The ships? \nNAVY SEAMAN (O.S.) They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir. \nThe Navy Seaman helps Norman to his feet.  Norman is smiling, it's over. \nINT.  HALLWAY \nNorman and the Navy Seaman walk down the hall. \nNORMAN How are the others? \nNAVY SEAMAN The others, sir? \nNORMAN Beth and Harry? \nNAVY SEAMAN They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting. \nNorman sighs, smiling.  The relief, the jubilation. \nNORMAN That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier... \nNAVY SEAMAN What was that, sir? \nNORMAN About the time paradox. (the Seaman nodding) How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- \nAs Norman looks up, the Navy Seaman, still walking and nodding, begins to slowly DISAPPEAR.  Disintigrating.  VANISHING before his eyes. \nNorman stops, looks around him.  He's gone. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nNorman watches on a monitor -- the VIDEO of him walking down the hall, the Navy Seaman walking next to him. \nNORMAN (O.S.) ... how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- \nON THE MONITOR -- the Seaman disappers. \nNorman stops tape.  Looks over at the MONITOR showing the SPHERE.  It is closed. \nTHE SCREEN goes BLACK.  Flashes up: \"Hello Norman\" \nNORMAN Jerry? \n\"Yes Norman\" \nNORMAN Jerry, did you create that man? \n\"The entity Navy Seaman was a Manifestation.  Did you have a Happy talk?\" \nNORMAN Jerry, are you manifesting what's destroying our habitat? \n\"Did you have a Happy talk?\" \nNORMAN Jerry, answer me. \n\"No.\" \nA VIDEO SCREEN with the choices: \"DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... \" \nTHUMP! \nThe sub slightly SWAYS. \nNorman sits still, nervous. \nTHUMP!  Harder this time. \nNorman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD.  Sweating.  Can't see anything in here. \nBANG!  It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth.  He grips the seat. \nNORMAN Beth!  Beth!  There's something -- ! \nTHUMP!  BANG!  He's thrown around in the sub.  He can't see anything, tosses around.  He reaches for the doorhandle. \nBANG!  He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  The Sub almost turns over on it's side. \nNORMAN Beth!  Shit! \nHis HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.  Water SPLASHING up from below. \nThen, EVERYTHING stops. \nThe sub SWAYS to a still.  He sits quietly.  Waiting.  Listening. \nReaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out. \nStands on top of the sub.  Keeping balance.  He looks around, finds a DOOR inside the dome.  Tries to open it.  Locked. \nLooks around.  Nothing else.  Looks down at the water.  Can he risk it? His BREATHING short. \nNORMAN Beth?  Can you hear me? \nNo reply.  He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  Grimacing. Then, cautiously slips down into the water... \nEXT.  UNDERWATER \nCLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.  Looking everywhere.  Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  Lands on the bottom. \nHis LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.  Shortness of BREATH. \nHe walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  The DARK WATER.  Can't see anything.  Scared to death. \nNORMAN Beth?  Beth?  Shit. \nTHE HABITAT -- ahead of him. \nNorman goes to a STANCHION.  Grips onto it.  Twists around.  Looking. Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster. Barely BREATHING. \nHARRY (O.S.) ... you there?  Norman? \nNORMAN Harry? \nHARRY (O.S.) Norman, where are you? \nNORMAN I can't breathe...  Am I... clear? \nHARRY (O.S.) You're clear.  You see the airlock? \nNorman, twists around, and as he does... \nA SEA SNAKE \nHISSES at his faceplate.  Norman SCREAMS. \nON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go. \nHARRY (O.S.) Norman! \nNorman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION, slithering between the grid-like posts. \nTHE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom. Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him. It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  Norman backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when... \nNORMAN is whisked up. \nHARRY has him by the collar of his suit.  Taking him up. \nINT.  AIRLOCK \nThey burst out of the water.  Harry throws Norman onto the floor. Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nNorman, panting, walks with Harry... \nNORMAN Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it -- \nHARRY What happened to her? \nNORMAN What do you mean?  She's not here? \nHARRY When I woke up, nobody was here. \nNORMAN She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me. \nHARRY Her suit's gone. \nNORMAN Beth left? \nHARRY I thought she was with you. \nINT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM \nNorman and Harry at the mic... \nBETH (O.S.) ... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship. \nNORMAN What are you doing in the ship? (beat) Beth? \nBETH (O.S.) Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad. \nNORMAN Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me. \nBETH (O.S.) Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me. \nNORMAN He what? \nHarry shakes his head: \"no way\". \nBETH (O.S.) When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship. \nHARRY I never said that. \nNORMAN It's like a sleeping pill? \nBETH \"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... \" \nNorman digs, finds paracin trichloride... \nNORMAN Here we go. \nCUT TO: \nBETH -- mixing the medicines... \nNORMAN (O.S.) (reading from the computer) \"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... \" \nBETH How long does it last? \nNORMAN Three to six hours. \nBETH I'll just boost the doses. \nNORMAN What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous? \nBETH How fast does it take effect? \nNORMAN Doesn't say. \nBETH What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that. \nBeth goes to the cabinet, grabs another medicine.  Norman comes over as she adds it to the mix... \nNORMAN What is that?  What are you doing? What do you want to do -- kill him? \nA beat... \nBETH It's an idea. \nNORMAN Beth -- \nBETH To be on the safe side.  I mean -- \nNORMAN You want to kill him? \nBETH Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place. \nShe fills the LARGE SYRINGE with the clear liquid mix. \nBETH You ever given an injection before. \nNORMAN Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You? \nBETH Only lab rats.  Here. \nShe hands him the syringe... \nBETH Give him the whole thing.  Hurry, before he wakes up. \nNorman looks at the syringe, like it's an assault rifle. \nNORMAN Where do I stick it? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LIVING QUARTERS \nHarry sleeps on his bunk.  The door to the room is closed. \nINT.  CAFETERIA \nNorman spirals down the stairway from the lab.  Hurrying through the dark cafeteria, the syringe at his side. \nINTO THE HALLWAY \nshuffling down the corridor, nervously.  Glancing at the syringe. \nROUNDS A CORNER \nand SEES in front of the Living Quarters... \nTWO AFRICAN-AMERICAN NAVY CREWMEN -- standing guard of the door. \nNorman stops, hides behind the wall. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LABRATORY \nNorman comes in... \nNORMAN He's got Farrakahn's army standing guard.  What's plan B? \nSuddenly, BANG!  The room shakes.  Shelves fall.  Cabinet doors swing open.  Norman falls to the floor. \nTHE COMPUTER MONITOR -- crashes down in front of his face.  It reads: \"I WILL KILL YOU ALL\" \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nNorman and Beth running... \nBETH Harry! \nBANG!  Water shoots through the wall.  Gushing out onto the floor.  The walls CRACKING. \nON HARRY -- running out of his room... \nHARRY What is it? \nNORMAN You know what it is, Harry. \nBANG!  They lose their balance, still running... \nNORMAN It's the squid!  Stop it! \nHARRY Stop what?  What are you -- ? \nBANG!  Another CRACK -- water gushing inside. \nNORMAN You know damn well what.  You're doing it! \nNorman grabs Harry, pushes him up against the wall. \nHARRY Doing what?  I'm not doing anything -- ! \nBeth takes the syringe from her palm, and STABS Harry in the SHOULDER. \nHE SCREAMS IN HORRIFYING PAIN, FADING OVER INTO... \nNORMAN And whatever it is, it's not coming from Harry. \nNorman looks at the monitors: \nON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN.  It's Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat. \nThe Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES.  The lettering on the boxes isn't in focus. \nNorman squints at the MONITOR -- can't make it out. \nNORMAN Beth?  What is that?  What are you doing? \nThe Sub's CLAW ARMS drops one of the BOXES, plumping it softly on the muddy floor. \nNORMAN Can you hear me?  Beth?  Can you copy? Get inside, there's something out there. \nON ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub moves forward.  Churning up the sediment. It stops again, and releases another box. \nNorman BANGS on the headset. \nNORMAN Damn it, Beth, I know you hear me. \nTHE MONITORS blink: \"I AM COMING FOR YOU\" \nON NORMAN -- breathing heavy. \nNORMAN What the hell? \nANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub in view -- a closer view.  It releases it's last box.  Norman can read the lettering now: \"CAUTION: TEVAC EXPLOSIVES\" \nNORMAN Beth?  C'mon.  What are you -- ? \nTHE MONITORS flash: \"I WILL KILL YOU\" \nNORMAN Oh shit. \nNorman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET. Searching for tapes.  Another cabinet.  Then another. \nA shelf labled: \"SPHERE\" -- all the tapes are gone. \nNORMAN It's her. \nTHE MONITORS flash: \"I WILL KILL YOU\" \nON THE HEADSET -- resting on the console.  WE HEAR faintly... \nBETH (O.S.) Norman?  Norman? \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nNorman pushes Harry and his IV down the corridor.  Hurrying.  An inch or two of water on the floor. \nINT.  LIVING QUARTERS \nCLOSE ON A METAL CASE -- labled: \"Captain Harold Barnes.\" \nNorman BANGS it against the wall, trying to bust the LOCK.  BANGING. BANGING.  Breaks the lock.  Digs inside the case. \nPulls out a GUN. \nINT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR \nNorman pushing Harry and the IV stand.  Wheels him into... \nBATHROOM/SINK AREA \nNorman stops.  Turns off the main lights.  The room goes dark.  The florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on. \nNorman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall.  Checks the IV. \nNorman goes to a STALL.  Steps inside.  Keeps the stall door open.  Can still see Harry about 10 feet away. \nNorman looks at the GUN.  COCKS it.  Pinches his finger. \nNORMAN Ouch. \nHe waits.  Listening. \nA FAINT HIGH-PITCHED HISSING SOUND \nNorman looks over at the sinks. \nA FAUCET is on.  Water HISSING faintly from it. \nNorman ignores it.  Waiting in the dark.  Listening. \nON THE FAUCET -- the water running. \nON NORMAN -- looking at it.  Can't ignore it.  Tries.  But can't. \nNorman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor. \nOVER TO THE SINKS \nThe light above them on.  Norman turns the faucet off.  The water stops. \nBut the HISSING SOUND remains. \nNorman looks at the faucet, queerly.  Turns it back on.  Then off. \nThe HISSING SOUND still there.  It isn't the water. \nNorman looks down at his feet... \nTHE FLOOR -- seems to be moving.  Something swimming in the water. \nCLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up inside his pantleg, HISSING.  His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly slides up past his knee. \nHISSING LOUDER \nAs more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall. \nNORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt. \nAnother SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman, sliding up around his neck. \nWE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COME FROM DOWN THE HALL \nNORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides, slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin, over his face.  Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING. \nBETH (O.S.) What time is it, Norman? \nNORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her jumpsuit. \nBETH Do you know the time? \nBETH Did I?  Or was that you? (beat) When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman. \nNORMAN You're insane. \nBETH Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane? \nNORMAN I never went in that sphere. \nBETH You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that. \nNORMAN Yes. \nBETH You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened? (off his look) That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  \"Like everything's on the tip of my tongue\", he said. \nNORMAN That's bullshit. \nBETH Is it? \nNORMAN Beth, the message said Harry.  \"My name is Harry\".  My name isn't Harry. \nBETH No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name? (imitating) \"Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming.\" \"But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared.\" \"C'mon, Harry, it'll be fine, it'll be fun.\" (resuming) You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it? \nNORMAN Shut up, Beth -- \nBETH When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  \"I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water.\" Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you? \nNorman stares up at her, frightened.  Is she right? \nBETH I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you? \nNORMAN It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be. \nBETH \"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything.\" Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle. \nNorman looks at her palm -- SEES the NEEDLE in her hand.  Norman backs up, away. \nNORMAN Don't, Beth. \nBETH But I have to, Norman. \nNORMAN I promise -- \nBETH Promise what, Norman?  Tell me! \nNORMAN Beth -- \nBETH You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine. \nNORMAN Don't, Beth.  Please. \nBETH It's either this... or I kill you. \nThe GUN in her other hand. \nNORMAN Beth -- \nShe comes at him, needle in hand... \nBETH It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things. \nNORMAN It's not safe for you to be either. \nBETH You think I care?  You think I care if I die? (almost laughing) Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self. \nShe lunges at him with the needle, missing.  He RUNS for the SPIRAL STAIRCASE leading to the lab.  Norman grabs the handrail, begins climbing the stairs. \nBeth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles. \nBETH Norman!  I'm doing this for you, Norman. \nHe frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels. \nBETH Norman. \nClimbing, climbing -- round and round -- the STAIRS never seem to end. He looks up: \nTHE STAIRS -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in number.  He climbs, racing, PANTING.  Beth, right behind him, laughing almost. \nBETH Come here, Norman. \nShe GRABS his ANKLE.  She raises the NEEDLE.  Norman turns, KICKS her in the FACE. \nShe WAILS, blood SPITTING from her nose. \nClimbing, climbing.  The STAIRS increasing above.  He LUNGES for the top step, GRABS it.  Pulls himself up... \nINTO THE LAB \nScrambling.  He stares down at Beth -- the GUN pointing at him. \nBETH Norman -- \nHe SLAMS the HATCH DOOR, on top of her, BASHING her head down.  He holds the DOOR closed.  Trying to regain his breath. \nBETH (O.S.) This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage. \nNORMAN Get away from the door, Beth. \nHe slides a heavy FILE CABINET over on top of the door. \nBETH (O.S.) Oh, Norman, I don't want to come in... \nThe door's METAL PIVOT turns... \nCUT TO: \nON BETH -- on the stairs, spinning the door's WHEEL... \nBETH ... I want to lock you in. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

I'm gonna have to lift her up to you. \nHarry leans down from the Sub's airlock... \nHARRY Alright.  Hurry. \nNorman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist. \nHARRY I can't reach her. \nNORMAN Hold on. \nNorman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist. \nHARRY Push her, c'mon. \nNORMAN I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her. \nHe flops her up again. \nHARRY Missed. \nNORMAN Are you trying, damn it?  Just -- \nMAN (O.S.) Four minutes and counting. \nNorman loses grip, drops her. \nNORMAN Hold on. \nHARRY Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes. \nNORMAN I heard!  I heard! \nPicking her up... \nHARRY Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three -- \nNORMAN Shut up and catch. \nNorman flops her up once more, and Harry grabs her AIR HOSE. \nHARRY I got her.  I got her. \nHarry pulls her toward the airlock, Norman climbs up after. \nINT.  SUB AIRLOCK \nThe pocket of air around the sub.  The three of them crammed inside. Norman opens the door on top of the sub. \nNORMAN Alright, here, I'll... wait, you -- just give her to me. \nNorman takes Beth and pushes her on top the sub.  The sub sways back and forth. \nHARRY Norman, what are you -- \nThey lose balance, Beth almost falls, Norman catches her. \nNORMAN Shit.  Alright, Harry, get in there. \nHarry jumps on top of the sub.  Slides inside it.  Reaches his arms out, catching Beth's legs. \nMAN (O.S.) Three minutes and counting... \nNORMAN Take her, come on.  Just -- \nBeth's LEG swings up and hits Harry in the helmet. \nHARRY C'mon, Norman! \nNORMAN I'm trying to keep balance with -- \nHARRY Gimme a second -- \nNORMAN Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here! \nHARRY Her legs are in the way. \nNORMAN You got her? \nHarry pulls Beth down inside, as Norman steps on top of the sub, helps push Beth's head inside. \nNORMAN Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry? \nHARRY I'm trying.  There. \nMAN (O.S.) Two minutes-thirty and counting. \nNorman drops inside. \nINT.  SUB \nNorman in the seat.  Beth's leg hangs over his right shoulder.  Harry looks at Norman who assesses the flight controls. \nHARRY You know how to work this thing? \nNORMAN No idea. \nHARRY Well, press something! \nNORMAN Wait! \nMAN (O.S.) Two minutes and counting. \nHARRY How long did you say -- \nNORMAN Shut up.  Let me think. \nNorman presses a button. \nTHE SCREEN -- blinks: \"DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... \" \nNorman hits \"ASCEND\".

A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite? \nBARNES Something like that. (beat) That doesn't surprise you? \nNORMAN Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash? \nBARNES As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago. \nA beat. \nNORMAN Four hundred?  You're kidding, right? \nANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft and a small layer of ROCK above it. \nBARNES See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick. \nNORMAN Geologists? \nBARNES Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year -- \nNORMAN -- Wait a second -- \nBARNES -- dating the crash at least that old. \nNORMAN Hold on -- \nBARNES Maybe older -- \nNORMAN -- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old. \nBARNES Extraordinary, isn't it? \nNORMAN It's impossible. \nBARNES I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor. \nINT.  STAIRWELL \nBarnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs. \nBARNES Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me. \nNORMAN It doesn't make any sense. \nBARNES We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now. \nNORMAN What team? \nBARNES The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration. \nNORMAN ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it? \nAs they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from under his arm, hands it to Norman. \nNorman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it. \nBARNES Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail. \nNORMAN But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life. \nINT.  BRIEFING ROOM \nON A VIDEO SCREEN -- sonar video of the spacecraft. \nBETH (O.S.) How big is this spacecraft? \nBARNES (O.S.) Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet. \nTED (O.S.) A half a mile long? \nBARNES The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen. \nThe team members sit around the conference table: \nTED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here.  BETH HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron. ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet.  HARRY ADAMS, 32, mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit. \nHARRY How much damage? \nBARNES To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch. \nHARRY Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch? \nBARNES I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts. (continuing) The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented. \nTED Never invented? \nON NORMAN, watching the team... \nBETH In basic English, what does all this mean? \nBARNES Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet. \nA LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRR \nINT.

What am I -- a leper? \nNorman sits up... \nNORMAN Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret? \nBETH I love secrets. \nNORMAN That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about? \nBETH I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant. \nNORMAN It's bullshit.  The report's a joke. \nBETH (beat) That's quite a secret. \nNORMAN I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea -- \nANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN, standing behind glass in the next room, monitoring Beth and Norman. \n", "test1_true": "NORMAN C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind. \nBETH Because when we get down there -- \nNORMAN Wait -- down where? \nBETH To the spacecraft.  To investigate. \nNORMAN Underwater? \nBETH What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here? \nNORMAN We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks. \nBETH Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean. (off his look) 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography. \nNORMAN It never occurred to me. \nBETH Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this? \nNORMAN The timing has never seemed quite right. \nBETH Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this. \nNORMAN (nervous laughter) What -- are you threatening me? \nEXT.

Arthur never looks at Norman, he just stares out at the water. \nARTHUR I don't know you, but I'll be honest with you.  I don't like this.  I don't like any of this.  Especially, the water. \nNORMAN Seasick?  A marine biologist? \nARTHUR I don't belong here.  None of us belong here.  Look at that. \nANGLE ON THE WATER, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves. \nNORMAN Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't it? \nARTHUR It scares the shit out of me. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON NORMAN, lying on a cot.  It is dark.  His eyes are open.  He stares at the ceiling. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DESCENT PLATFORM \nA porthole hatch to the DESCENT SUB unlatches loudly.  A SUB-OFFICER help Norman lower himself through the hatch. \nINT.  DESCENT SUB \nNorman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment.  Seated in a circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur.  Ahead of them, Captain Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall of plexiglass. \nNorman takes a seat between Beth and Ted. \nBARNES (O.S.) (through the intercom) Our descent will take 13 minutes. Descending at a speed of 80 feet per minute. \nAcross from Norman, Harry is WHISPERING something quietly into Arthur's ear. \nBARNES (O.S.) Pressure adjustments will cause the sub to lurch at times, but don't be alarmed.  It's perfectly normal... \nArthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whisper into his ear. \nBARNES (O.S.) The sub's interior atmosphere will experience moisture as we descend, and the temperature will drop rapidly.  Just relax and remain seated during the descent. \nNorman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat. \nBARNES (O.S.) We have clearing from the base. \nRed interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and WE HEAR the sub make a HISSING sound.  The sub lurches, and begins to lower in the water. \nNORMAN Arthur? \nHarry has gotten to Arthur.  Arthur is on the verge of panic. \nNORMAN Arthur?  You alright? \nARTHUR Open the hatch door, please. \nHarry continues to whisper in his ear. \nARTHUR Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please. \nBARNES (O.S.) Calm down, Dr. Levine. \nARTHUR Let me out, Captain.  Open the door! \nBARNES (O.S.) Please, Dr. Levine. \nArthur leaps violently out of his seat, scrambles to the plexiglass wall. \nBARNES (through the plexiglass) Sit down, Dr. Levine!  You're in a military operation now -- \nArthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists. \nBARNES ... Your civil rights have been overridden! \nARTHUR Open it, Captain! \nBARNES Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat! \nArthur VOMITS, violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall. \nARTHUR Open the fucking door! \nThe sub LURCHES again, coming to a stop.  The compartment is totally silent, as they begin ascending to the surface. \nON HARRY smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at Norman. \nThe sub lurches again, and WE HEAR clanking metal.  The hatch door opens. \nAnd Arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and out the hatch door. \nBARNES (O.S.)

CONTROL ROOM \nNorman SCRIBBLES on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of paper... \nNORMAN After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him. \nBETH Manifested? \nNORMAN Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, \"Stop calling me Jerry\".  And -- \nNorman stops, staring at the pad. \nNORMAN He translated it wrong. \nBETH What? \nNorman picks up the pad of paper, reads... \nNORMAN Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What is your name?...  My name is Harry. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nHarry is walking towards the Living Quarters... \nNORMAN (O.S.) Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say \"Harry\", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry. \nBETH (O.S.) What do you mean, a part of Harry? \nBACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM \nNORMAN When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere. \nBETH You think, in the sphere -- \nNORMAN He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things. \nBETH But how? \nNORMAN I don't know. \nBETH How can the sphere do that? \nNORMAN I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid... \nBETH Which I told Barnes was attacking -- \nNORMAN It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real. \nBETH But why is he doing it? \nNORMAN He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream. \nBETH His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you? \nNORMAN (shaking his head) No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible? (off her look) It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are. \nCUT TO: \nIN -- THE LIVING QUARTERS \nIt's dark.  Harry lies on his bunk, asleep. \nBETH (O.S.) And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested. \nNORMAN (O.S.) Must be.

A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite? \nBARNES Something like that. (beat) That doesn't surprise you? \nNORMAN Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash? \nBARNES As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago. \nA beat. \nNORMAN Four hundred?  You're kidding, right? \nANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft and a small layer of ROCK above it. \nBARNES See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick. \nNORMAN Geologists? \nBARNES Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year -- \nNORMAN -- Wait a second -- \nBARNES -- dating the crash at least that old. \nNORMAN Hold on -- \nBARNES Maybe older -- \nNORMAN -- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old. \nBARNES Extraordinary, isn't it? \nNORMAN It's impossible. \nBARNES I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor. \nINT.  STAIRWELL \nBarnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs. \nBARNES Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me. \nNORMAN It doesn't make any sense. \nBARNES We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now. \nNORMAN What team? \nBARNES The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration. \nNORMAN ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it? \nAs they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from under his arm, hands it to Norman. \nNorman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it. \nBARNES Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail. \nNORMAN But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life. \nINT.  BRIEFING ROOM \nON A VIDEO SCREEN -- sonar video of the spacecraft. \nBETH (O.S.) How big is this spacecraft? \nBARNES (O.S.) Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet. \nTED (O.S.) A half a mile long? \nBARNES The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen. \nThe team members sit around the conference table: \nTED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here.  BETH HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron. ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet.  HARRY ADAMS, 32, mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit. \nHARRY How much damage? \nBARNES To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch. \nHARRY Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch? \nBARNES I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts. (continuing) The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented. \nTED Never invented? \nON NORMAN, watching the team... \nBETH In basic English, what does all this mean? \nBARNES Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet. \nA LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRR \nINT.  TESTING ROOM -- LATER \nA large, X-Ray APPARATUS moves to the side, revealing Norman's FACE. \nON BETH -- standing next to him. \nBETH Five years.  No phone calls.  What am I -- a leper? \nNorman sits up... \nNORMAN Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret? \nBETH I love secrets. \nNORMAN That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about? \nBETH I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant. \nNORMAN It's bullshit.  The report's a joke. \nBETH (beat) That's quite a secret. \nNORMAN I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea -- \nANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN, standing behind glass in the next room, monitoring Beth and Norman. \n", "test1_true": "NORMAN C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind. \nBETH Because when we get down there -- \nNORMAN Wait -- down where? \nBETH To the spacecraft.  To investigate. \nNORMAN Underwater? \nBETH What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here? \nNORMAN We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks. \nBETH Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean. (off his look) 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography. \nNORMAN It never occurred to me. \nBETH Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this? \nNORMAN The timing has never seemed quite right. \nBETH Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this. \nNORMAN (nervous laughter) What -- are you threatening me? \nEXT.  SHIP -- LATE AT NIGHT \nTHE SKY -- clouds looming on the horizon. \nANGLE ON ARTHUR LEVINE, leaning against the railing, looking out at the water. \nON NORMAN, approaching him.  Arthur never looks at Norman, he just stares out at the water. \nARTHUR I don't know you, but I'll be honest with you.  I don't like this.  I don't like any of this.  Especially, the water. \nNORMAN Seasick?  A marine biologist? \nARTHUR I don't belong here.  None of us belong here.  Look at that. \nANGLE ON THE WATER, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves. \nNORMAN Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't it? \nARTHUR It scares the shit out of me. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON NORMAN, lying on a cot.  It is dark.  His eyes are open.  He stares at the ceiling. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DESCENT PLATFORM \nA porthole hatch to the DESCENT SUB unlatches loudly.  A SUB-OFFICER help Norman lower himself through the hatch. \nINT.  DESCENT SUB \nNorman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment.  Seated in a circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur.  Ahead of them, Captain Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall of plexiglass. \nNorman takes a seat between Beth and Ted. \nBARNES (O.S.) (through the intercom) Our descent will take 13 minutes. Descending at a speed of 80 feet per minute. \nAcross from Norman, Harry is WHISPERING something quietly into Arthur's ear. \nBARNES (O.S.) Pressure adjustments will cause the sub to lurch at times, but don't be alarmed.  It's perfectly normal... \nArthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whisper into his ear. \nBARNES (O.S.) The sub's interior atmosphere will experience moisture as we descend, and the temperature will drop rapidly.  Just relax and remain seated during the descent. \nNorman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat. \nBARNES (O.S.) We have clearing from the base. \nRed interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and WE HEAR the sub make a HISSING sound.  The sub lurches, and begins to lower in the water. \nNORMAN Arthur? \nHarry has gotten to Arthur.  Arthur is on the verge of panic. \nNORMAN Arthur?  You alright? \nARTHUR Open the hatch door, please. \nHarry continues to whisper in his ear. \nARTHUR Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please. \nBARNES (O.S.) Calm down, Dr. Levine. \nARTHUR Let me out, Captain.  Open the door! \nBARNES (O.S.) Please, Dr. Levine. \nArthur leaps violently out of his seat, scrambles to the plexiglass wall. \nBARNES (through the plexiglass) Sit down, Dr. Levine!  You're in a military operation now -- \nArthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists. \nBARNES ... Your civil rights have been overridden! \nARTHUR Open it, Captain! \nBARNES Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat! \nArthur VOMITS, violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall. \nARTHUR Open the fucking door! \nThe sub LURCHES again, coming to a stop.  The compartment is totally silent, as they begin ascending to the surface. \nON HARRY smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at Norman. \nThe sub lurches again, and WE HEAR clanking metal.  The hatch door opens. \nAnd Arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and out the hatch door. \nBARNES (O.S.) Anybody else? \nSilence. \n", "test1_id": 978, "test2_input": "Beth rushes by Ted, carrying bags to the door... \nBETH Norman?  Where's Norman? \nTED By the bunks. \nINT.

Can you see him? \nA still moment and then Harry tumbles out the sphere, and falls to the ground. \nINT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nBarnes, squinting at Harry on his monitor. \nBARNES (O.S.) How does he look?  Can you tell? \nHarry lies motionless. \nEDMUNDS (O.S.) He looks... dead, sir. \nON BETH -- in the hall, hearing that. \nINT.

CAFETERIA \nBarnes speaks to the team (minus Harry and Norman)... \nBARNES They told me about sixty hours. \nBETH Two and a half days? \nTED How long can we last down here? \nEDMUNDS Comfortably?  Seventy-two hours. \nBETH Comfortably -- what's that mean -- with oxygen? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LIVING QUARTERS \nCLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE \nHarry lies on his bunk.  He begins to slowly awake. \nWE BEGIN TO HEAR A SCRATCHING NOISE, like nails on a chalkboard.  It gets LOUDER as Harry comes to.  He puts his fingers to his temples. \nNorman stands beside, him writing in his notebook. \nHARRY What is that?  That noise? \nNORMAN What noise? \nHARRY It's like... \nANGLE ON Norman's pen -- as he stops writing, the NOISE stops. \nHarry sighs.  Norman looks down at his pen. \nNORMAN Harry, can you tell me about the sphere? \nHARRY What are you still doing here? \nNORMAN You remember opening the door? \nHARRY You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here. \nNORMAN Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry? \nHARRY You don't understand about the sphere. \nNORMAN Then explain it to me. \nHarry pauses, staring almost like a frightened little boy. \nHARRY Norman? \nNORMAN What is it, Harry? \nHARRY What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87? \nNORMAN Page 87 of what, Harry? \nHARRY I could never read that far.  I never wanted to. \nNORMAN That far in what, Harry? \nHarry doesn't say anything.

Beth -- I wanted to have a word with you... \nBarnes washes his hands at the sink, looking at her in the mirror in front of him. \nBARNES Back at the door -- I asked you to back away. \nBETH Yeah.  I heard you. \nBARNES There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely. \nBETH (a beat) Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures. \nHe walks to the door, then turns. \nBARNES And Beth, one other thing.

It's definitely nonrandom.  See... \nHarry sitting at the monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, and Edmunds a PRINTOUT of the screan -- indicating a pattern. \nHARRY It's a single sequence repeated over and over. \nBARNES We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it? \nTED Maybe it's a message? \nEDMUNDS From what? \nTED The sphere.  Maybe the sphere -- \nEDMUNDS We're not hooked up to the sphere. \nHARRY Well, if it's a discharge -- \nTED It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message. \nBARNES From the sphere? \nTED What's inside the sphere. \nHARRY If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it. \nTED Yeah, I'll work on it, too. \nBARNES (to Ted, flat) You do that. \nINT.  BATHROOM/SHOWER AREA \nTed, nervous, anxious -- with five or six printouts in his hand -- has Norman's ear in front of the sink... \nTED He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things. \nNORMAN Like what? \nTed hands him a printout... \nTED It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation. \nNORMAN You mean a picture? \nTED Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light. (Norman does) Go ahead.  Squint at it. \nNORMAN I don't see anything. \nTED Squint harder. \nNORMAN Please, Ted. \nTED (hands him another printout) Try this one. \nNORMAN This is like nursery school. \nTED Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature. \nNORMAN The creature? \nTED Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know? \nON NORMAN -- Ted's lost it. \nNORMAN Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with? \nTED Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that \"someone went to a lot of trouble, try again\" bullshit.  And \"impotent\".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON MONITOR -- spirals now. \nHARRY ... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code? \nTED (to Norman) See?  No code.  What'd I say? \nHARRY Codes are for hiding information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it... \nNORMAN That's brilliant. \nTed grimaces at Norman. \nHARRY ... spiralling out of the center, you see: \"G\" is one, \"B\" is two, \"H\" is three, and so on... when I got the message. \nBARNES What's the message? \nHARRY I have to tell you.  It's strange. \nBARNES How do you mean, strange? \nHarry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads: \nHARRY \"Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What is your name?  My name is Jerry.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY \nBarnes walks briskly down the hall, Norman with him... \nBARNES He translated it wrong.  \"My name is Jerry\"?  It's like \"See Spot run.\" \nNORMAN The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.

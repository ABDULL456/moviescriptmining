REVERSE ANGLE ON CATHERINE 
crouched to one side, clutching the dog to her chest. Seeing Mr. Gumb, the dog squirms frantically, BARKING. 
CATHERINE Get me a telephone. Lower it down to me. Do it now, mister! I don't want to have to hurt this little dog. 
UPWARD ANGLE 
on Mr. Gumb, as, with a cry of fury, he whips the Colt from inside his kimono. The muzzle gleams as he takes aim. 
Catherine yanks the dog up, into his line of fire, screaming at him. 
CATHERINE You shoot motherfucker you better kill me quick or I'll break her fucking neck, I swear to God! 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) (wails) Nooooooo! 
Tucking the dog under one arm, she grabs its muzzle, twisting the head. The dog WHINES piteously. 
CATHERINE Back off, you son of a bitch! Back off! 
UPWARD ANGLE 
as Mr. Gumb cries out again - a terrible, inarticulate scream of rage and anguish. But then he slowly lowers his gun. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
On Catherine, as she maintains her grip. 
CATHERINE That's better... Now get me a live telephone. Get a long extension and lower is down here... And you better do it fast, too, 'cause I think her leg's broken. She's in pain, mister, she needs a vet. 
MR. GUMB 
stares down at her, a long beat, breathing heavily. 
MR. GUMB You think she's in pain? You don't know what pain is. But you're going to find out... 
And abruptly he vanishes. SOUND of his footsteps, rushing off. 
CATHERINE 
begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably. She hugs the little dog tight to her chest, buries her face in its fur, sobbing... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - BELVEDERE, OHIO - DAY 
HIGH ANGLE as a rented sedan pulls up to the curb, stops. After a moment Clarice climbs out, a bit stiffly. Double- checking this address, she glances up from a folded street map to - 
AN OLD, THREE-STORY WOODEN HOUSE 
in a row of similarly shabby homes, all backing onto a narrow river. A path of boards, laid over mud, leads back along this house towards the brown water. SOUND of hammering from there. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BIMMEL HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 
An awesome huddle of pigeon coops sprawls by the brackish water. The birds' COOING mixes with the HAMMERING. A tall, gaunt man in a knit cap is obsessively pounding nails into a new coop. 
CLARICE 
approaches him, and the man lowers his hammer. He has red- rimmed eyes of watery blue. His face is deeply seamed. 
CLARICE Mr. Bimmel...? 
He stares back at her, warily. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BIMMEL HOUSE - STAIRCASE - DAY 
HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN as Mr. Bimmel leads Clarice up a steep flight of steps. The bannister is worn, sags a bit. 
MR. BIMMEL I don't know nothin' new to tell ya. The police been back here so many times already... Fredrica went into Columbus on the bus to see about a job. She left the interview OK. She never come home. 
Clarice pauses, at the landing, to look at a framed photo: the familiar graduation portrait. Others pictures show Fredrica as a young girl, toddler, infant - plump and hopeful at each age. 
MR. BIMMEL Her room's how she left it. Just shut the door when you're done. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FREDRICA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
CLARICE'S POV - MOVING SLOWLY as she takes in flowery chintz curtains... posters of Madonna and Blondie... a twin bed, with worn, stuffed animals on the pillow... a big sewing machine in the corner. 
CLARICE 
turns, absorbing nuances. There is loneliness here, an echo of desperation under this steeply pitches ceiling. A shrill MEOW, and she looks down... 
BIG TORTOISESHELL CAT 
is rubbing against her ankles. 
CLARICE 
picks up the cat, scratches behind his ears. She glances up.

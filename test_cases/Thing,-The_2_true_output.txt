SANCHEZ You guys going to let him give orders? I mean he could be one of those Things. 
The other regard Garry tensely. No one oblivious to the fact, that Sanchez just might be right. 
MACREADY (calm) Put it away, Sanchez. Just put it away. 
Still trembling, he tosses the shells back into the broken case, leans the gun against the wall and begins to sob. 
Nauls skates over to comfort him. 
The men watch as Garry lowers his gun. He turns to them. 
GARRY I don't know about Copper. But I didn't go near that plasma... (beat) But I guess you'll all rest easier if someone else is in charge. 
He hands his gun to Norris. 
GARRY Can't see anyone objecting to you, Norris. 
NORRIS Sorry, gentlemen... (rubs chest) ...Don't think I'd be up to it. Haven't been feeling well lately. 
Childs goes for the gun. 
CHILDS I'll take it... 
MacReady beats him to it. 
MACREADY Maybe it should be someone a bit more even-tempered, Childs. 
Childs glares. 
MACREADY (to others) ...Any objections? 
Roving eyes pass about the hallway. Nobody is sure who to trust. MacReady seems as good as any. 
INT. REC ROOM 
The men have gathered to discuss plans. Furtive and untrustworthy glances are passed around the room. 
MACREADY ...From what we know this Thing likes to go one on one. So we stick together as much as possible. In two's and three's. 
Childs points to Garry, Dr. Copper and Clark. 
CHILDS What do we do about those three? 
MACREADY We got morphine, don't we. 
Fuchs nods. 
MACREADY Well, we keep them loaded. Stash them here in the rec room and watch 'em twenty-four hours. 
PALMER (ears perk up) Morphine? You know I was pretty close to that dog, too. 
Palmer is ignored. 
NORRIS We should sleep in shifts. 
MACREADY Right. Half of us awake at all times. 
SANCHEZ How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who? 
MACREADY (to Fuchs) Can you think of any other tests? 
FUCHS I'll try.  I could sure use Copper's help though. 
CHILDS You can eighty-six that thought right now, man. 
Dr. Copper eyes his accuser solemnly. 
MACREADY Also... When this Thing turns... it turns slowly at first. I think we can handle it in that state. But if it ever got to full power... from what I saw of that Norwegian camp... well, I just don't know... It would probably take it an hour or more to get like that. So no matter what anybody's doing, we all return to this room every twenty minutes. Anybody gone longer than that... anybody trying to leave... we kill 'em. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COMPOUND - DARKNESS 
It is the dead of winter. Six months of darkness ahead. Palmer fights the cold as he works dismantling the engine of the helicopter. 
He frowns, searching for something. 
PALMER (mumbles) Where's that magneto? Can't find a darn thing around here any more. 
INT. REC ROOM 
Copper, Clark and Garry sit moodily together on a couch. 
Norris awkwardly prepares to give them their injections. 
He is new at this. Childs stands guard with his torch. 
Dr. Copper offers to help. 
DR. COPPER I'll do it. You're going to break the needle in my arm.

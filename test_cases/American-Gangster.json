{"train": "AMERICAN GANGSTER \nWritten by \nSteven Zaillian \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT July 27, 2006 \n1   EXT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY                                                  1 \nA tall, handsome man in a dark suit emerges from a Lincoln Towncar and enters a small, basement R&B/Jazz club. \n2   INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY                                                  2 \nHe approaches a booth, says something in the din to the men there, then calmly shoots them and exits. \nAMERICAN GANGSTER \n3   EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY (NOVEMBER)                                   3 \nBumpy Johnson, an elderly but still sturdy black man, elegantly dressed - cashmere overcoat, gloves, Homburg - stands in falling snow atop a flatbed truck - as he does every Thanksgiving - tossing down turkeys to the poor - like a benign king. \nLegend:   Harlem \nA younger man, the gunman from the club - Frank Lucas - Bumpy's driver/bodyguard/collector/protege - watches from below. \n4   INT/EXT. STREET / DISCOUNT EMPORIUM - DAY (NOVEMBER)                  4 \nWhispering gunfire from a television set veiled by foreground snow: Soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam in 1970. A rich, cultured, authoritative voice offers: BUMPY O/S This is the problem. This is what's wrong with America. \nThe war footage multiplies by twenty: a stack of TVs with price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window. \nBUMPY O/S It's gotten so big you can't find your way. \nPeople on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass. \nBUMPY The corner grocery's a supermarket. Candy store's a MacDonald's. And this place. (MORE) (CONT) \n4   CONTINUED:                                                          4 BUMPY (CONT'D) Where's the pride of ownership here? Where's the personal service? Does anybody work here? \nInside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to stretch off into infinity. The TVs give way to a display window full of Japanese stereo componentry. \nBUMPY What right do they have cutting out the suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out, buying direct from the manufacturer - Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks - putting Americans out of work? \nHe's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer. \nBUMPY What am I supposed to do with a place like this, Frank? Who am I supposed to ask for, the assistant manager? (pause) This is the problem. This is the way it is now: You can't find the heart of anything to stick the knife. \nBumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in. They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he sinks to his knees. Frank kneels down. \nFRANK What is it? \nBumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused. FRANK Somebody call an ambulance! \nBut the store suddenly seems empty. Frank yells into the emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of. Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly - \nBUMPY Forget it, Frank. No one's in charge. \n5   EXT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                        5 \nLimousines from the funeral disgorge mourners: family, friends, celebrities, politicians. Cops on horseback move through the enormous crowd that has gathered to watch. FBI agents in cars snap pictures with long lenses of Italian mobsters like Albert Tosca. \n(CONT) \n5   CONTINUED:                                                         5 \nREPORTER - whose passing has brought together a who's who of mourners on this chilly afternoon. The Governor has come down. The mayor of New York - its Chief of Police and Commissioner - sports and entertainment luminaries - \nA white Bentley pulls up, disgorging Jackie Fox - the original Superfly - and his entourage. With his trademark tinted Gucci glasses on, he happily poses for anyone with a camera - including the Feds - before going inside. \n6   INT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - LATER                                     6 \nThe report continues on a TV no one's really watching here: a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem gangster, Robin Hood and killer. \nREPORTER ON TV He was a Great Man, according to the eulogies. A giving man. A man of the people. No one chose to include in their remembrances the word most often associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson: Gangster. \nSitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment, heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners circling the place like vultures: \nTango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar. \nTOSCA White wine, please. \nA white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down next to Frank. \nBANKER How you doing, Frank? \nFRANK All right. \nBANKER What a loss. (Frank nods) How are you otherwise?   Things okay financially? (CONT) \n6   CONTINUED:                                                        6 \nFrank doesn't say. It feels unseemly to him to be talking about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table. \nBANKER Bumpy set something up for you? \nFrank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster. \n10   INT. NY POLICE HQ - ENTRANCE/STAIRS - DAY                        10 \nFour men in long black leather coats stride toward like they own the city. It's impossible to tell if they're cops or gangsters. \nLegend:   New York City \n11   INT. NEW YORK POLICE ANNEX - PROPERTY ROOM - DAY                 11 One of the same undercover cops - Detective Trupo - scribbles a signature and badge number different from the one on his gold shield lying next to the voucher requesting evidence needed in court. \nHe pushes the voucher under a sign - \"All Handguns and Narcotics Before 10am Next Window\" - to a clerk who takes it past floor-to-ceiling shelves covered with files, plastic bags bulging with handguns, knives and gambling receipts. Bulkier items - like shotguns and baseball bats - lie unwrapped with dangling tags. \nThe clerk reaches a chain-link cage where the most valuable items are locked up - narcotics, pornography, cash - checks the voucher against tags, takes down an old green suitcase. \n12        EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                             12 \nTrupo's car - a Shelby Mustang - roars up. He climbs out, crosses to a warehouse with the suitcase as the other three SIU Princes of the City follow from another car, cradling grocery bags. \n13        INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                             13 \nTrupo snaps the suitcase open revealing five half-kilo bags of uncut heroin in clear plastic bags. The other cops pull from the grocery bags: a Pyrex mixing bowl, flour sifter, boxes of milk-sugar, latex kitchen gloves, a medical scale, and yellow baggies. \nHands peel back the distinctive black and green \"evidence\" tape on the clear plastic bags. Dump the heroin into twenty yellow baggies. A half-kilo of lactose is poured into each of the now-empty property room bags. \nTRUPO Now just enough for the reagent test. \nHe removes one tablespoon of heroin from each of the baggies, and the now-almost-heroin-free powder is mixed through the flour sifter, poured back into the clear bags, the tape resealed, the bags returned to the suitcase. \n14        INT. NY COURTROOM - DAY                                          14 \nThe suitcase and   \"heroin,\" and some weapons and money, have been arranged on   an evidence table with the care of a Macy's display window.    Trupo - the officer in charge of the case - watches the jury   files in - 15        EXT. UNDER EXPRESSWAY - DAY                                      15 \nA Lincoln Continental pulls up. Trupo climbs out of his Shelby with a sports bag, crosses to the Lincoln, climbs in back where an Italian wise guy - Rossi - sits. Trupo unzips the bag revealing the recut heroin - in the yellow plastic. \nROSSI V/O This is the French Connection dope. The same dope Popeye Doyle and Sonny Grasso took from us. \n16 OMIT                                                             16 OMIT \n17     INT. ITALIAN BAR - NY - DAY                                      17 \nFrank comes into an empty bar, chairs up on tables. A middle-aged man mopping up glances up at him as he crosses to a back room. \nROSSI V/O They seize it, arrest everybody, whack it up and sell it back to us. Our dope. They been living off it for years, these New York cops. \n18     INT. ITALIAN BAR - BACK ROOM - NY - DAY                          18 \nSeveral ounces of the dope sits in foreground on a table. \nROSSI They basically control the market with it. What the fuck has happened to the world, Frank? \nFRANK Fuckin crooks. \nRossi, who looks more like a middle-aged accountant than the Italian dope supplier he is, makes two espressos. \nROSSI Sad about Bumpy. \nBehind Frank, a TV airs a report by Walter Cronkite on the heroin problem among GIs in Vietnam. \nROSSI Things are never going to be the same in Harlem. The girls, the clubs, the music - walk down the street, nobody bothers you because Bumpy's making sure of it. (hands Frank one of the espressos) How bad is it there now? \n18pt   FLASHCUTS TO HARLEM                                            18pt \nGuys barge into a room, steal money from a crap game at gunpoint - Cops push guys against a bar, empty their pockets - A dealer shoots another dealer in an alley - \n18pt   BACK TO THE HOTEL ROOM                                         18pt \nFRANK It's chaos.    Every gorilla for himself. \n(CONT) \n18pt   CONTINUED:                                                        18pt \nROSSI Who can live like that? There has to be order. That would never happen with Italians. More important than any one man's life - is order. \n19     EXT. HARLEM - DAY                                                   19 \nA street sign on a corner:        116th and 8th Avenue. \n20     INT. DINER - HARLEM - DAY                                           20 \nAs is his custom, Frank eats breakfast alone. A middle- aged waitress appears when he's done, picks up his plate and refills his coffee. \nFRANK Thank you, Charlene.      Last one. \nCHARLENE It's all right with me, Frank, you can stay all day if you want, but I wouldn't. It's nice outside. \nFRANK Then maybe I'll have to go for a walk. Just cause you said so. \nShe smiles and leaves. Frank pours some sugar in his coffee. Someone taps on the window and he looks up, sees two servicemen - one in uniform - one he recognizes. \n21     INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                              21 Frank leads the servicemen up the stairs of a building. \n22     INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       22 \nCorner apartment above the street. A girl sits smoking at a work table covered with drug-cutting apparatus. Another - Frank's cutter and sometimes-girlfriend, Red Top - sets a couple of packets of heroin in front of the servicemen. \nRED TOP On the house for our men in uniform. \nSERVICEMAN 1 Why, thank you, sugar, that's very kind. \nRIVERA Richie - \nRichie gets out, opens the trunk, grabs a Slimjim and bolt cutters, cuts through a gate chain and strides to the accountant's car, Rivera following. Richie trips the passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release, and, as he comes around back to search it - \n(CONT) \n28   CONTINUED:                                                       28 \nRICHIE Check inside. \nRivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one anymore, is done. He crawls inside the car to look under the seats and in the glove compartment. Gravely - \nRICHIE Javy ... \nRichie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside. Rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of it rubber-banded together, spilling from grocery bags - more than either of them has ever seen. As the trunk closes - \n29   EXT. PARKING LOT / RICHIE'S CAR - LATER - NIGHT                  29 \nRichie and Rivera sit in their car in silence, staring out at the car with the money in it. Eventually - \nRICHIE This isn't a couple of bucks. \nRIVERA It's the same thing.   In principle. \nRICHIE We're talking about principle? \nRIVERA Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of money says one thing: He'll turn in cops who take money. We'll be pariahs. RICHIE We're fucked either way. \nRIVERA Not if we keep it. Only if we don't. Then we're fucked, you're right. But not if we keep it. \nRICHIE (more to himself) Yes, we are. \nRIVERA Goddamn it, did we ask for this? Did we put a gun to someone's head and say, Give us your money? Cops kill cops they can't trust. We can't turn it in. \nThey regard each other again in silence ... \n30   INT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - LATER - NIGHT                    30 \nAs a police captain counts the stacks of money, Lou Toback, Richie's superior from the prosecutors office, walks in, his night out interrupted by this emergency. He crossed to where Richie and Rivera sit alone in a corner. Quietly: \nTOBACK How much. \nRICHIE Nine hundred and eighty thousand. \nTOBACK What happened to the rest? \nIt's a joke but isn't funny, not even to Toback. He regards his men who turned it in, then the other cops in the place - who are watching them and the money being counted. Toback walks over to the captain, and, quietly: \nTOBACK What're you doing counting this in front of everybody? Are you out of your fuckin mind? Take it into a room. Now. \nRichie's glance to Rivera says, You're right, we're fucked. \n31   INT/EXT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - PRE-DAWN                     31 \nAs Richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him - knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect, but contempt and fear, like Rivera predicted. Neither will ever be trusted again. He climbs into his car, drives off. 32   INT. DINER - HARLEM - DAY                                     32 \nTango and his bodyguard come in and approach Frank's table where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast. \nTANGO Didn't you see the jar, Frank? I think you walked right past it. \nFrank ignores him, forks at his eggs, eats.    Tango sits. \nTANGO The money jar. On the corner.      What I got to do, put a sign on it? \nFrank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't full. He swallows finally, but then only reaches for his coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating Tango. (CONT) \n32   CONTINUED:                                                        32 \nTANGO Bumpy don't own 116th Street no more, Frank. Bumpy don't own no real estate in Harlem no more. I'm the landlord now and the lease is twenty-percent. \nFrank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives Tango a look that says that won't be happening. \nTANGO Then don't sell dope, Frank. Get a fuckin job. You need a job? You can be my driver, drive me around, open my door, yes, sir, no sir, where to, sir, right away, Massa Johnson, sir. \nRight now Tango is dead. No doubt about it.          On the surface, though, Frank remains cool. \nFRANK Twenty percent? \nTANGO Of every dollar. Every VIG, every truckload, every girl, every ounce.      In the jar. \nFRANK Twenty percent's my profit. If I'm giving it to you then what am I doing? Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you know, out of business, which puts you out of business. (reaches for his breakfast check) There are ways to make money legitimately, and then there's this way. Not even Bumpy took twenty percent. \nTANGO Bumpy's fuckin dead. \nFrank regards Tango a moment, gets up, takes out his money clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of Tango. \nFRANK There.   That's twenty-percent. \nAs he turns and leaves, Tango watches after him ... \n33   INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               33 \nStitched-up, black and blue hands dump a can of soup in a pot, put it on the stove. \n34   INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - INTERCUT                     34 \nA pencil clutched by long fingers scribbles figures. But no matter how many times Frank does the arithmetic, there's not much left, he calculates, after he pays the Italian suppliers and, if he were to, Tango. \nRICHIE (to the vandals) Hey, you want to shut up over there? \nThe teenagers ignore him. He tries to ignore them, but it's hard with the constant noise. \nRICHIE No court will allow it for one thing. I won't allow it. \nLAURIE You? \nRICHIE When am I supposed to see my son? \nLAURIE Last weekend! \nTheir son glances over at them. Richie looks over at the teenagers again breaking bottles, then back to Laurie. \nRICHIE Laurie, you can't raise a kid in Las Vegas. \nLAURIE Oh, like this is a good environment. Around your friends. There are less creeps in Vegas. \nRICHIE What's he going to grow up to be in a mobbed up place like that? What are you thinking? \nLAURIE I'm thinking - Richie - of him! \nRICHIE Goddamn it - \nThe noise of the glass is driving him crazy. He strides over to the teenagers, who look at him like, What are you gonna do, old man, it's four against one. \nRICHIE I told you nice to shut the fuck up. Now I'm gonna kill you. \nHe pulls out his gun and aims it at one of them, then the others. All instinctively try to cover their heads. (CONT) \n49      CONTINUED:                                                       49 \nRICHIE Pick up the fuckin glass! \nAs they dive to their knees to do what they're told, Laurie walks away with her son, who looks back over his shoulder at his father with his gun out. \n50      EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT                                             50 \nFrank sits in the back of a motor samlor.       Bicycles dart around it like flies. \n51 - 52 OMIT                                                 51 - 52 OMIT \n53      INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - NIGHT                                   53 \nThe clientele is almost exclusively black servicemen on R&R and Asian women. A trio of ex-GI's plays authentic Southern blues on a small stage. Ham hocks and collard greens come out of the kitchen. Smoke chokes the place. \nFrank, one of the few men not in uniform, and not drunk or stoned, sits alone at a table with a Coca-Cola and surveys the activity: Dope being rolled. Dope being smoked. Dope being shot. GI's and prostitutes climbing a staircase. \nHis eyes follow an Army Master Sergeant, moving among the tables as if checking on the GI's well being. But at some, his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder. \nThe Sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching Frank watching him from across the room. He squints through the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in a kind of shock, more to himself - NATE Frank - ? \nFrank half-lifts his glass to wave, and Nate beams. \n54      INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - NIGHT                                   54 \nFrank has guests at his table now: his cousin Nate the Sergeant, and two young Asian wise guys. They talk about him in Thai (subtitled): \nTHAI He say how much he wants? \nNATE He said \"a lot.\" What that means, I don't know. Four or five keys? \n(CONT) \n54   CONTINUED:                                                       54 \nThe Thais regard Frank a moment, size him up. \nTHAI He's your cousin. \nNATE My cousin-in-law.    My ex-wife's cousin. \nTHAI Ask him how much he wants. \nNATE How much you gonna want, Frank? \nFRANK A hundred kilos. \nNate blinks like there's something in his eye ... \n55   EXT. BANGKOK - STREET VENDER - DAY                               55 \nSteam and neon.    Frank and Nate at a crowded stand. \nNATE No one I know can get that much. It'd have to be pieced together from several suppliers and none of it's gonna be 100- percent pure. \nFRANK That's not what I want. \nNATE I know that. But that means dealing with the Chiu-Chou syndicates in Cholon or Saigon - if they'll deal with you - \nFRANK No, even then it's too late. It's been chopped. I want to get it where they get it. From the source. \nNate stares at him ... then laughs.       Frank doesn't. \nNATE You're gonna go get it. \nFRANK Why not. \n(CONT) \nG56   CONTINUED:                                                       G56 \nNATE Fifty, to cover them all. \nFRANK A hundred. And it's all I got left. So if that dope doesn't arrive, for whatever reason - (embraces Nate and whispers) Cousin or no cousin - don't let me down. \nHe holds out a business envelope fat with money. Nate hesitates, knowing Frank has just said he'll kill him if things don't go right, then takes it. \nNATE I'll let you know when it's in the air. \n56    INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NEWARK - DAWN                            56 \nThe nurse/paramedic who stitched up his hand is in Richie's bed making so much noise he's worried someone will call the cops. The phone rings. And won't stop. Neither will the nurse as Richie answers it - \nRIVERA V/O Richie? Richie, I'm in trouble.    This fuckin guy \"made\" me - I don't know how but he did. He went for his gun. I had to do it, I swear to God. Now they're going to kill me. \nRichie can hear in Sander's voice how serious it is and manages to disentangle himself from the woman. RICHIE Who. \nRIVERA V/O There's a hundred people out there heard the shots. You gotta help me. You gotta do something. \nRICHIE Is he dead? \nRIVERA V/O He's dead.    I'm dead. They're gonna kill me. \nRICHIE Where are you? Javy, where are you? \n(CONT) \n56    CONTINUED:                                                       56 \nRIVERA V/O That's the problem. \nA57   INT. RICHIE'S CAR - MOVING - EARLY MORNING                      A57 \nRichie on his police radio, which cuts in and out - \nDISPATCHER There are no cars in that area, Detective Roberts. \nRICHIE Bullshit. I got a man in trouble and I need back-up. \nDISPATCHER I missed that - you're breaking up - \nRICHIE I said, put the fucking call out again - \nDISPATCHER I just did. No one responded.     I'll try again, but - \nRICHIE Fuck you, too. \nHe slams the mic down. \n57    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                            57 \nAs Richie's car turns a corner, the Stephen Crane Projects - the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark 30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument. \nHe parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive heat. It's riot weather. \n58    INT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                            58 \nDrugs on a coffee table. Body on the floor. Rivera, despondent, on the couch. The male paramedics, scared. Richie on the phone - \nRICHIE Sergeant, I'm not asking, I'm fuckin telling you: Get some patrolmen over here now. \n(CONT) \n58    CONTINUED:                                                         58 \nDial tone: the police sergeant has hung up on him.           Richie throws the phone. The paramedics stare at him. \nPARAMEDIC You got no back-up? Why is that? \nThe only other person who would know the answer to that is Rivera, who just shakes his head in despair. \nRICHIE Bandage his head. \nPARAMEDIC Detective ... he's dead. \nRICHIE I know he's fucking dead. Bandage his head, clean him up, put him on a gurney and prop it up so he's sitting. And open his eyes. \n59    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                              59 \nRichie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at the crowd to allow a path to the ambulance. \nRICHIE Step back, injured man coming out. Let them do their job and he'll be all right. Ma'am. Excuse me. Step back. Sir. Please. \nThe people step back when they see the victim on the gurney: tubes in his nostrils, IV in his arm, eyes open. Before they can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance. As it pulls out, siren wailing, Richie leads Rivera safely away - \nA60   EXT. ALLEY NEAR STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                  A60 \nThey cross through an alley near the Projects and Rivera finally breathes a sigh of relief. \nRIVERA Thank you - \nThe words aren't out of his mouth before Richie shoves him up against a car. \nRICHIE You robbed him, didn't you. \nFRANK That basically's the whole picture right there. \n84   INT. MORGUE - NIGHT                                              84 \nA cadaver drawer slides open revealing - not Tango - but Rivera, staring up lifeless, his arms, stomach, legs and toes dotted with the scabs of a longtime addict. \nDETECTIVE Did you know his girlfriend? Good- looking girl. One of his informants. \n(CONT) \n84   CONTINUED:                                                       84 \nRICHIE Beth. \nThe medical examiner slides open another cadaver drawer containing her body. Richie stares at it. \nDETECTIVE Should've seen their place.    Like animals lived there. \nRICHIE I have seen it. \nDETECTIVE (to the examiner) Chose a good night, huh?   Grand Central Station in here. \nMEDICAL EXAMINER It's been like this. I'm lucky I get home before midnight; lots of careless- ness. \nRichie regards Rivera's personal effects resting on his chest in a plastic bag: few bucks, the Corvette key, a half- empty packet of heroin in blue cellophane. Richie takes the blue cellophane from the bag and, as the drawer closes entombing Sanders, holds it in his hand ... \nREPORTER V/O Heroin addiction is no longer exclusive to big city neighborhoods; it's epidemic - \n85   TIME CUT.    A TELEVISION:                                       85 The reports shows lawmakers on Capitol Hill juxtaposed against images of inner-cities, junkies, homicide victims and, perhaps most telling, white suburbia. \nREPORTER ON TV Since 1965, law enforcement has watched its steady increase and with it a rise in violent crime. Now unaccountably, it has exploded, reaching into cities as a whole - our suburbs and towns - our schools. \nINT. POLICE GYM - DAY \nThe TV is in a small police gym where Richie lifts weights, very much aware of his pariah status as out-of-shape cops come in, only to leave again when they see him. \n(CONT) \nCONTINUED: \nREPORTER ON TV Someone is finally saying: enough. Federal authorities have announced their intention to establish special narcotics bureaus in Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Newark and other major cities - \nToback comes in, watches Richie, alone, working out. \nRICHIE V/O It's a dog and pony show. \nTOBACK V/O It's not being advertised as one. \n86   INT. POLICE GYM - LATER - DAY                                    86 \nRichie's changing into his street clothes. \nRICHIE But it's federal. I'd have to answer to who? FBI? \nTOBACK Me and the U.S. Attorney. No one else. No FBI. Hoover knows better than to mix his men with dope. Too much temptation for the feeble-minded. \nThough he's not in much of a position to refuse the assignment, Richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea. Toback levels with him - TOBACK Richie, a detective who doesn't have the cooperation of his fellow detectives can't be effective. \nRICHIE You know why I don't have it. \nTOBACK Doesn't matter. \nRICHIE No, they're all on the take and I'm not and it doesn't matter to anyone. Instead of giving you a medal for turning in money, they bury you. \n(CONT) \n86   CONTINUED:                                                       86 \nTOBACK It's fucked up. You're right. Maybe this's an opportunity away from all that. \nThey regard each other.    Eventually - \nRICHIE I'll do it, but only like this: I don't set foot in a police station again. I work out of a place of my own. And I pick my own guys. Guys I know wouldn't take a nickel off the sidewalk. \nTOBACK Done. \n87   EXT.

NYPD 23RD PRECINCT - LOCKER ROOM - DAY                  120 \nClock on the wall of a locker area: 3:58. Shift change. Cops in t-shirts. Fans blowing the humid air around. \n121   INT/EXT.

Frank glances out the wet windshield of the Chevy and watches 116th Street transform: \nIt's as if an outdoor market has just opened its stalls. Junkies and dealers emerging from the alleys, storefronts, tenements and side streets - from the street itself it seems - snarling the cars and delivery trucks caught unaware. Small blue cellophane packets - and only blue - are pulled from pockets and change hands. In alleyways it's cooked up and sucked into syringes, and in dank, grim, indescribably filthy rooms, plunged into veins - \n124   AND THE REVERSE:                                             124 \n10 and 20 dollar bills changing hands - decks of cash rubber-banded together - put into envelopes and delivered to the Lucas brothers, to: \n125   LESTER at his metal door shop.                               125 \n126   EUGENE at his dry cleaners.                                  126 \n127   TURNER at his tire service shop.                             127 \n128   EARL at his electrical shop.                                 128 \n(CONT) \n123   CONTINUED:                                                      123 \n129   TEDDY at his body shop.                                          129 \n130   INT.

It's actually tiring. \nTEDDY We're going to be here all night if we count every bill. \nTIME CUT: A money-counting machine flips through the bills, its counter flying.

It's a kind of office party for Frank's brothers, cousins, wives and girlfriends, distributors like Rossi and other East Harlem guys, Charlie Williams, couple of cops on Frank's payroll, and the Chemical Bank Vice President. \nBANKER You got a stockbroker, Frank? \nFRANK I deal with enough crooks as it is. \nThe banker jots down a name and phone number on the back of one of his business cards. \nBANKER This one couldn't be more honest. Ask around. He's got a lot of clients in the business. You can't leave all your money in safety deposit boxes; give him a call. \nThe banker hands him the card and moves on. Frank's trying to have a good time, but the level of noise and revelry is beginning to make him uncomfortable. \nCHARLIE Frank.   This is Mike Sibota. \nSibota tries not to look as nervous as he feels. (CONT) \n132   CONTINUED:                                                       132 \nFRANK Mr. Sibota.

You can pick it up here tomorrow. Where's the rest of the money? \nRICHIE That's half. I'll give you the other half tomorrow when you give - \nMECHANIC No, no, no, I don't do that.    Go fuck yourself. \nRichie rather reluctantly hands over the rest of the 20K. \n143   INT/EXT. SPEARMAN'S CAR - MOVING - NEAR GW BRIDGE - DAY 143 Spearman watches the pickup truck driven by the mechanic change lanes up ahead - heading for the George Washington Bridge - and glances over concerned to Richie, who is changing the cashmere sweater for an old t-shirt. \nSPEARMAN He's going into New York.   Are we? \nRICHIE What are they going to do, arrest us? \nSPEARMAN They could. New York cops.     They can do worse than that. \nRICHIE We're not losing that money.    Go. \n(CONT) \n143   CONTINUED:                                                     143 \nAs Spearman follows the truck, the George Washington Bridge, linking Jersey to Manhattan, looms in the windshield ... \n144   EXT. EAST HARLEM STREET - DAY                                   144 \nThe pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on. \nRichie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who has to double back quickly not to be seen \nRichie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck. Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge. \nRICHIE Get out. \nTAXI DRIVER What? \nRICHIE Get the fuck out of the car! \nThe driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in. \nHe swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic, screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding - \nThe truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple car-lengths ahead - in sight. \n145   EXT. EAST HARLEM - DAY                                          145 \nRichie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza parlor. Richie climbs out, crosses the street. Coming past the place, he tries to look inside without breaking stride. \n(CONT) \n145   CONTINUED:                                                      145 \nFrom around a corner, striding toward him, come four men looking like Gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair - the Princes of the City. Richie detours into an alley as they enter the restaurant. \nRichie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol. \nRichie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. As they come past Richie - \nRICHIE That's my money. \nSIU DET 1 The fuck are you. What money? \nRichie shows them his Bureau of Narcotics ID. \nRICHIE The bills are sequenced and registered with the Essex County Prosecutors Office. All begin with CF3500. Take a look. \nRICHIE Down south, Florida?   Cubans?   What. \nTONY I don't know. All I can tell you is whoever it is, they're upsetting the natural order of things. \nAmong the framed family photos around them, is a picture of Tony's uncle, Albert Tosca. \n157   EXT. LIVINGSTON, NEW JERSEY - DAY                               157 \nA Napoleonic statue of the same man on horseback in a fountain outside a castle-like mansion. Next to it \"ride\" three others on marble horses - a woman and two children. \nTOSCA Pull - \nA clay pigeon sails out across the manicured garden. A shotgun blast shatters it. The man with the gun - Albert Tosca - hands another to Frank. As Frank sets to shoot, Ana can seen behind them, with Tosca's wife in the opulent house, looking uncomfortable. \nMRS. TOSCA The whole place was imported brick by brick from Gloucestershire. \nANA It's very nice. \nMrs. Tosca nods. Ana nods.

You should marry her. \nFRANK Too many things to look after right now to think about that. \nTOSCA Frank. That's a mistake. If I may say. Don't take her for granted, girl like that. \nThey enter a rich, wood-paneled study lined with books. \nTOSCA You interested in history, Frank? The events that have brought us to where we are today? You know who was? Bumpy. \nFRANK Bumpy was interested in a lot of things. \nTOSCA I always wonder if people know when history's being made. And what they're doing at the time. This, for instance, could be a historic moment, and you're sipping a glass of ice water. \nDroplets snake down Frank's glass. He senses Tosca has finally gotten around to why he was invited here. TOSCA Bumpy and I did a lot of business together, as you know. Whatever he needed, he'd come to me and I'd do my best to provide it. He came to me, I didn't go to him, is the point I'm trying to make. You know why? \nFRANK He didn't have what you needed. You had what he needed. We've always had to come to you. \nTOSCA Yes.   Until now. \nTosca studies Frank, who is a study in inscrutability. \n(CONT) \n158   CONTINUED:                                                     158 \nTOSCA Monopolies are illegal in this country, Frank, because no one can compete with a monopoly. If they let the dairy farmers do that, half of them would go out of business tomorrow. \nFRANK I'm just trying to make a living. \nTOSCA Which is your right. Because this is America. But not at the unreasonable expense of others. That's un-American. (he studies Frank) You know the price you pay for a gallon of milk doesn't represent its true cost of production. It's controlled. Set. \nFRANK I set a price I think is fair. \nTOSCA It's very unfair, in fact. Your customers are happy, but what about your fellow dairy farmers? You're not thinking of them. \nFRANK (very calmly) I'm thinking of them as much as they ever thought of me. \nTOSCA All right. I can see you're getting excited. Don't get excited. That's not why I invited you to my home. To get excited. \nFrank doesn't look excited at all. He's the picture of calm. Tosca smiles benignly and gets up. \nTOSCA Here, I got something for you. \n159   INT. TOSCA'S SMOKING ROOM    - LATER - DAY                      159 \nTosca opens a humidor, takes out a couple of Cuban cigars. \nTOSCA Now what if - I'm just thinking out loud - you sold some of your inventory wholesale and I helped with the distribution. (CONT) \n159   CONTINUED:                                                     159 \nFRANK I don't need it. I already got everything from 110th Street to Yankee Stadium, river to river. \nTOSCA Which is a little mom and pop store compared to what I'm talking about. I could make you bigger than K-Mart. L.A., Chicago, Detroit, Vegas. I'm speaking nationwide. And I'd guarantee you peace of mind. You know what I mean by that. \nFrank does. It's a backhanded threat.        Tosca clips the cigars with a gold guillotine \nTOSCA Frank. You can see I'm a Renaissance man. Unfortunately not all my people are as enlightened. Ask them, What is civil rights, they don't know. They're not as open to change from the way things are done and who's doing it. But I can talk to them so there won't be any misunderstanding. That's what I mean by peace of mind. \nFrank knows, in truth, he's not being given any choice in this matter. Still, maybe it's not so bad. \nFRANK You pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? I'd consider 50. And I can get you as much as you want. Tosca slips on his best poker face. Fifty thousand a kilo would be an extraordinary coup for him. \nRichie tries to find the guy in the chinchilla coat, but he's hidden by a flag. Then he glimpses him again just as Ali shakes his hand before climbing into the ring - \nFlashbulbs pop throughout the arena as Robert Goulet begins the National Anthem. Ali pointedly doesn't sing along. Richie frames the shadowy figure in the chinchilla coat, focuses as sharp as he can in the bad light, and snaps the shutter - \n168   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY                          168 \nRichie tacks the photograph of the man in the chinchilla coat to his Table of Organization - low and off to the side by other pieces of the puzzle that don't fit, other new faces with no names. Spearman holds a scrap of paper - \nRICHIE That's is the plate number on the limo. Check with the company, who rented it. \nSPEARMAN He's a supplier at most. Or just a pimp. We'd've heard of him otherwise. \nRICHIE No, he's bigger than that. His seats were phenomenal; better than Al Tosca's. Joe Louis and Ali shook his fuckin hand. \nThey look from Tosca's high position on the board to Frank's low one, and a wedding march played in traditional fashion on organ begins and carries over: 169   INT.

Just coming off his high, and the attempted murder, Jimmy looks disoriented as he sits in cuffs in the dungeon-like basement. \nRICHIE Because it's an attempted homicide, that's Grand Jury. Now, that Grand Jury could come in very favorably. Might turn out to be Attempted Manslaughter. Self Defense even. She had a knife. Depends on how I want to deal with you. You see where this is going. \nJimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern. \nJIMMY The fuck is this place? \nRICHIE Let's say you beat it somehow. What do you think Cousin Frank'll think of that? He knows you had to sit here listening to something like this. And then you beat an attempted murder? Is he stupid?

No one does. At a certain point it's just greed. \nJACKIE What do you want, Frank?    You want me to call it something else? \nFRANK I have to insist.

Suddenly his face is illuminated by light reflecting in the rear view mirror, an unmarked police car behind them, flashing its brights. \nFRANK It's all right, pull over, what are they going to do? Give us a ticket? \nBut Teddy isn't as calm as he begins to pull over. \n223   EXT.

Then - \nTRUPO Now what are we gonna do about this? \nFRANK We're gonna shut the trunk and say good night, forget you pulled us over. \nTRUPO I got a better idea. \nTrupo reaches into the trunk, picks up two of the heroin bricks, tucks them under his arm and looks at Frank - \n(CONT) \n223    CONTINUED:                                                         223 \nTRUPO Or would you rather I took it all and threw you and your brother in the fuckin river? \nFRANK I don't know, would you rather it's your fuckin house blows up next time? \nThey hold each others' stare for a long moment. \nTRUPO I loved that car. \nFRANK I know. \nTOBACK That's because they all think you're on the take and you think they are. \nRICHIE They don't want this to stop. It employs too many people. Cops, lawyers, judges, probation officers, prison guards. The day dope stops coming into this country, a hundred thousand people lose their jobs.

That because you were \"honest\" and didn't take money like every other cop, I left you? \nThe bailiff looks over, but she doesn't care. \nLAURIE You don't take money for one reason: to buy being dishonest about everything else. And that's worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about - drug money, gambling money nobody's gonna miss. (more people look over) I'd rather you took it and been honest with me. Or don't take it, I don't care. But don't then go cheat on me. Don't cheat on your kid by never being around. Don't go out and get laid by your snitches and secretaries and strippers. I can tell just by looking, she's one of them. \nHis lawyer.    Which is true.    Everyone's watching them now. \nLAURIE You think you're going to heaven because your \"honest.\" You're not.

That someone employed by the this office believes the United States Army is in the drug trafficking business - and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men who've given their lives in the defence of democracy. \nRICHIE There are drugs on that plane - \nUS ATTORNEY Shut the fuck up. \nRichie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate organization of his world, his superiors. \nUS ATTORNEY Is it any wonder then, because of your actions, the entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastic- ally as that fucking transport plane? That's what you've accomplished Mr. Roberts. Single-handedly. \nRICHIE I had good information the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane. \nUS ATTORNEY And that target is? \n(CONT) \n298   CONTINUED:                                                     298 \nRICHIE Frank Lucas. \nNo one in the room, except Richie and Toback, has ever heard the name. The federal men regard one another blankly. \nUS ATTORNEY Who?  Who's Frank Lucas? (no one seems to know) Who's he work for? Which family? \nRICHIE He's not Italian. He's black. \nNow there's a longer, even deeper silence, before - \nUS ATTORNEY Is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement, you're making jokes? \nRICHIE I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia in the dope business. I believe he buys direct from the source in Southeast Asia, cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US military planes and personnel to bring pure No. 4 heroin into United States. \nRichie is looking at faces that are still trying to make sense out of his ridiculous theory. Toback tries to come to his defense - TOBACK Richie has a lot of experience - \nUS ATTORNEY Does he. And how many arrests has he made in his so-called investigation? \nRICHIE I was promised when I took this job, it was about real arrests. \nUS ATTORNEY Does that mean `none?' \nRICHIE I have cases against most of Frank's organization. Not him - \n(CONT) \n298        CONTINUED:                                                       298 \nUS ATTORNEY (more to the others) Frank's organization - \nRICHIE That's right. \nUS ATTORNEY No fucking nigger has accomplished what the American Mafia hasn't in a hundred years! \nRICHIE Yeah, you'd know, sitting here, having never been on the (street) - \nUS ATTORNEY Lou, get this fucking kike out of here - \nRichie goes for him and lands several punches before Toback and the others can pull him off. \n299 OMIT                                                              299 OMIT \n300        INT/EXT.

The place teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move under the shadow of the towers. \n332    INT. GROUND FLOOR, SOUTH TOWER, THE PROJECTS - DAY           332 \nRichie removes the cover plate of an elevator, cuts the wires, disengaging it, then leads the Amigos, followed by more detectives to a stairwell.

The detectives come around a corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door. \nThey step back. Consider one other.

You think that impresses me? \nGuards look over, then glance away once it's clear the outburst is through. Richie remains serene. Eventually - \nFRANK Let me ask you something. You think by putting me in jail, you're going to stop even one junkie from dying? Because you won't. If it isn't me, it'll be someone else. With me or without me, nothing's going to change. \nRICHIE Then that's the way it is. \nFRANK You have any sort of case? Or just that idiot drives for my brother. Is he your case? Because if it's just him and the powder, it's not enough. \nRICHIE Then you got nothing to worry about. \nBut Frank is worried, most of all by this cop who doesn't take money sitting placidly in front of him. \nFRANK My brothers won't talk to you. My cousins. None of my family. No one but that mother fucking driver. RICHIE I got more than that. I got a line of people wanting to testify that stretches out the door and around the block. \nFRANK Bullshit. \nRICHIE Is it? Tony the Bug.     Benny Two-Socks.

Which you all but put out of business. \nFRANK This is who you're going to put on the stand? Guys who don't know me? Who got nothing to do with me? \nRICHIE They have everything to do with you. And the only thing they hate more than you is what you represent. \nFRANK I don't represent nothing. \nRICHIE You don't? Black businessman like you? Of course you do. But once you're gone, things can return to normal. \nFRANK Look at me. You looking? Can you tell by looking it would mean nothing to me if tomorrow you turned up dead? \nRICHIE Get in line. That one stretches around the block, too. \nFrank has never been so frustrated by anyone in his life. He wants to work something out with Richie obviously, but he can't figure out how. Frank studies him. \nFRANK What can we do? \nRICHIE You know what you have to do. \nFrank does, but doesn't like it, and doesn't know if he can do it. \nFRANK I could give you cops, but that's not who you want, is it. You want organized crime names. \nRICHIE I'll take them, too.   I want them all. \n(CONT) \n343   CONTINUED:                                                     343 \nFrank isn't sure he heard right. \nFRANK You'll take them, too? You'd go after cops? Are you serious? You'd do that? Lock up your own kind? \nRICHIE They're not. Not the ones in business with you. They're not my kind any more than the Italians are yours. \nThey regard one another in silence.      Richie can tell Frank sees daylight. \nFRANK What can you promise me? \nRICHIE I can promise you if you lie to me about one name, you'll never get out of prison. Lie about one dollar in one offshore account, you'll never get out. You can live rich in jail the rest of your life, or poor outside it, that's what I can promise. \nFrank is silent for several moments.      Finally - \nFRANK You know, I don't care if the feds take all my buildings, my stocks, my off-shore accounts. They can take it all, I don't care - use it to build battleships, paint bridges, whatever the fuck they want. Fight another war. But those other motherfuckers - the cops - put my money in their pockets. Millions. \nRICHIE I believe it. \nFrank debates with himself the step he's about to take ... \nRICHIE I want to know everyone   you've met for the last twenty years.    Everyone you sold to. Every cop you ever    paid off. Every one who ever stole from   you. Every one you remember. \n(CONT) \n343   CONTINUED:                                                     343 \nFRANK Oh, I remember them all.

Those I only know too well. I'm talking about being a cop. \nRICHIE About taking money? I don't care about money. I don't do that. \nSHEILA Because it'll come out.

That's going to look good. \nRICHIE I grew up with them, big deal. \nSHEILA What about Anthony Zaca? \nRICHIE What about him? SHEILA Richie, I'm just trying to understand things your wife has said. If they're not true, tell me. \nRICHIE Yeah, Tony's one of them. \nSHEILA Is he also your son's godfather? \nRichie nods. Sheila glances over to where Richie's ex-wife sits with her own lawyer across the room. \nSHEILA Do you really care about this? Or do you just not want her to win - ever.

But she wants to make it never. \nSHEILA Yeah, all right. Give me a twenty.

He hears a sound - cars arriving - and crosses toward the house where a sold \"For Sale\" sign leans against a half-built kennel. \nOut front, a caravan of cars and pickup trucks - North Carolina plates - loaded with boxes and suitcases - has just arrived. Exhausted from the drive but excited to be here, the travelers climb out: Frank's five brothers, their wives and kids, and their mother. \nTeddy thinks it's the right place. The others aren't as sure. The house is too nice. There's a new Lincoln Towncar parked outside the garage. They'll probably be shot for trespassing. The front door opens and Frank comes out, trailed by his dog. He first gathers his mother in an embrace, then each of his startled brothers. \n75   INT.

Frank, at the head of the table, clearly loves having them all here. \nTURNER He got an arm on him.     Major League arm, ain't that right. \nEveryone agrees as Turner's son - Frank's nephew - the 18- year-old boy seen pitching in the North Carolina back yard - tries to shrug.

Why? Because he didn't own the    company. He thought he did. He didn't.     He only managed it. Someone else owned    it. So they owned him. \n79   INT/EXT.

FRANK You are what you are and that's one of two things. You're nothing ... or you're something. Understand what I'm saying? \nThe brothers nod tentatively, stare at the now-empty glass container.

I didn't    see nothing in it. \nTANGO The fuck you want, Frank - \nBefore the last word is out of Tango's mouth, Frank's got a gun pressed against his forehead. Silence. Everyone backs away - the bodyguard, too. Tango's girl pulls her arm from his and takes off. Eventually - \nTANGO What're you going to do, boy? Shoot me in broad daylight? In front of everyone? \nIt's as if life on the street has stopped. No one moves; everyone is looking at Frank; maybe that's what he wants. As Tango laughs at the thought - \nFRANK Yeah, that's right. \nFrank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like someone hit with a board. Frank stands over him and empties the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street. \nThen it's quiet again. Everyone's still looking him, but Frank doesn't run. Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops it in the \"jar\" and sets it next to the body. \nFRANK For the cops. Should be enough. \nFrank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the place.

With the skinny white woman. \nRichie's glance finds a young black man dancing wildly with his skinny white date. \nSPEARMAN That's Abruzzo, with the fat black one. \nRichie sees a young Italian with tatoos - the only other white man in the place - dancing with a heavy black woman. Both Jones and Abruzzo look more like criminals than cops. \n(CONT) \n100   CONTINUED:                                                      100 \nSPEARMAN Both are good with wires.

The Towncar pulls to the curb. \nFRANK I got it. \nFrank gets out before Doc can, and escorts Ana to the car. \nFRANK I hope you weren't waiting long. A woman as beautiful as you shouldn't have to wait for anything. \nHe opens the door for her like a perfect gentleman, slides in after her. \n103   EXT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J.

He served New York and it served him. \nANA What was he to you? \nFrank has to think.     Bumpy was more than his employer. \nFRANK Teacher. \nANA What'd he teach you? \nFRANK How to take my time ... how if you're going to do something, do it with care ... do it with love. \nAnd it's working here.

Any second now, like every other guy she's ever met, she's sure he'll try to take her upstairs. \nFRANK I got five different apartments in the city I could've taken you to. I brought you here instead - \n(CONT) \nCONTINUED: \nAna glances to the stairs which Frank's mother is coming down. \nFRANK To meet my mother. \nMRS. LUCAS Is this her? Oh, she's beautiful, Frank.

Richie, perched on a desk in front of it. \nRICHIE Our mandate is to make major arrests. No street guys - we want the suppliers - the distributors. \nSpearman, Jones and Abruzzo sit in the back, looking like delinquent students. Of everyone in the open ground-floor that's been only slightly renovated - and there are about fifteen of them - they're the most disreputable-looking. \nRICHIE Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines. No grass under a thousand pounds. Less than that, someone else can waste their time. \nJones nudges Abruzzo to pay attention. Abruzzo elbows him back. Richie just waits like a teacher for their attention. \nRICHIE We'll be handling big shipments, big money, big temptation. (Jones raises his hand) Yeah. \nJONES There's a story about you. About turning in some money. A lot of money. Is it true? \nJones isn't the only one here curious to know.

The perspective shifts to Richie, Spearman and Jones in a car, watching as Abruzzo chats briefly with the dealer before the exchange takes place: $10 for a blue-cellophane packet. \n108   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - LATER - DAY                  108 \nRichie and the others watch Jones tests the heroin. \nJONES Stuff's ten percent pure.

None has ever heard of anything on the street that pure. \nRICHIE You paid ten bucks for it? \nJONES And it's all that's out there. \nRICHIE Now, how is that possible? Who can afford to sell shit twice as good for half as much? Richie glances to a Table of Organization: Surveillance photos haphazardly thumb-tacked to a bulletin board - known dope men in the hierarchies of their individual crime families - almost all of them Italian. \nWOMB TO TOMB SEQUENCE: \nAn R & B song begins and continues over - \n109   CLOSE-UPS:                                                      109 \nA poppy bulb being pierced, the white liquid oozing, changing into filthy liquids in wooden bowls, and finally a gray paste ... \n110   INT.

I can tell you. It was a junkie. Or a rival. Or some dumb ass kid trying to make a name for himself. Or someone you forgot to pay off. Or slighted without realizing it. Or someone you put out of business by being too successful. (pause) Success has a lot of enemies. Your success is who took a shot at you. How you gonna kill it? By being unsuccessful?

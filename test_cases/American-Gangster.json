He hears a sound - cars arriving - and crosses toward the house where a sold \"For Sale\" sign leans against a half-built kennel. \nOut front, a caravan of cars and pickup trucks - North Carolina plates - loaded with boxes and suitcases - has just arrived. Exhausted from the drive but excited to be here, the travelers climb out: Frank's five brothers, their wives and kids, and their mother. \nTeddy thinks it's the right place. The others aren't as sure. The house is too nice. There's a new Lincoln Towncar parked outside the garage. They'll probably be shot for trespassing. The front door opens and Frank comes out, trailed by his dog. He first gathers his mother in an embrace, then each of his startled brothers. \n75   INT.

In front of everyone? \nIt's as if life on the street has stopped. No one moves; everyone is looking at Frank; maybe that's what he wants. As Tango laughs at the thought - \nFRANK Yeah, that's right. \nFrank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like someone hit with a board. Frank stands over him and empties the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street. \nThen it's quiet again. Everyone's still looking him, but Frank doesn't run. Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops it in the \"jar\" and sets it next to the body. \nFRANK For the cops. Should be enough. \nFrank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the place.

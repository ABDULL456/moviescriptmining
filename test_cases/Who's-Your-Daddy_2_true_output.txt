TED But absolutely true. 
Ted moves closer.  Julie doesn't move away.  The SINGER seems to be performing just for them. 
SINGER (O.S.) ..."A feeling deep in your soul/Says you were half, now you're whole..." 
Just as Ted and Julie are about to kiss, Julie's eyes widen. She grabs Ted's hand. Simultaneously, they turn towards THE SINGER... 
JULIE & TED OH. MY. GOD. 
It's the Mother Lode!  That's not just any middle-aged torch singer. That's Principal Merkin.  Dressed in drag as Barbra Streisand. And doing a mighty fine job of it. 
Ted pulls out his camera and fires away. Blinded by the stage lights, Principal Merkin sings and vogues glamorously. He has no idea his secret is out. 
EXT. NIGHTCLUB/CINCINNATI STREET - NIGHT 
Ted and Julie rush down the street in the rain, giggling, totally euphoric. They stop to catch their breath. Their clothes are drenched, but they couldn't care less. In no time they've got their arms wrapped around one another, kissing and laughing. 
TED We just found the ULTIMATE centerfold for "The Girls of Xenia!" 
Suddenly Julie sobers, pulls away. 
JULIE I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia." 
TED I know, their small town mentality can be maddening. 
JULIE I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly. 
TED Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor. 
Julie eyes him skeptically. 
JULIE You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts. 
TED You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all. 
JULIE Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades? 
TED You're quick. I like that. 
JULIE You think you're working with chimps here? 
TED The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word. 
JULIE Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted. 
CUT TO: 
TREMBLING HANDS, STRUGGLING TO LOAD A ROLL OF FILM INTO A NIKON. 
INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 
Ted closes the back of his camera. Takes a deep breath. And forces a confident smile. He then peers into the... 
SHOWER 
Where Christy Malone limbers up.  Stretching her leg against the wall. Wearing her sexy cheerleader uniform. 
CHRISTY I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear. 
TED I do? I mean, yeah, I do. 
CHRISTY I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now. 
TED Do it? 
CHRISTY You know...take the pictures? 
Christy does her warm-up contortionist poses for Ted. Clothes still on.  As reflectors bounce strobes into the shower area. 
Years of being a merciless tease, paying off right here and now. Christy knows how to make love to the camera. 
TED I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail. 
CHRISTY Which you pulled, hard!

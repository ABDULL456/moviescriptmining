{"test1_input": "NECKBONE (CONT'D) Aw shit. \nAs he scrambles to gather the fallen pages, Ellis notices a dried BOOT PRINT next to his foot. He lowers his shoe from the cabinet leaving a smaller, muddy print of his own. He leans in to examine the larger print. The impression of a CROSS has been left in the heel. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) Her tits are so small. Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the cross marking. His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin. On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty cans of Beanie Weenie. In the booth, he sees a grocery bag. Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it. \nELLIS Neck. \nNECKBONE Look at that beave. You gotta see this. Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag. His fingers pull back the edges to reveal its contents: one can of unopened Beanie Weenie and half a loaf of BREAD. \nELLIS Neck. Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze. It's FRESH. Ellis freezes. \nNECKBONE What? \nELLIS Someone's here. \nNECKBONE What? Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone. \nELLIS Someone's livin' here. Neckbone sees the grocery bag. His eyes widen. The boys are stone frozen. They listen for other sounds. Silence. \nBEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Both boys flinch at the sharp sounds. Neckbone's hand flies to cover the alarm on his wristwatch. \nNECKBONE Shit. \nELLIS We gotta go. I can't be late. \n15 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - MOMENTS LATER 15 \nThey drop out of the tree and hit the ground running. \n16 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - MOMENTS LATER 16 \nThe boys' feet rush across the tree trunk bridging the creek. \n17 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - MOMENTS LATER 17 \nThey launch out of the treeline and sprint to their boat. Neckbone grabs the side and starts pushing the boat to the water. Ellis slings his backpack in and joins him. Suddenly, Ellis straightens up, leaving Neckbone to struggle. \nNECKBONE What are you doing? Ellis stares at a muddy boot print, cross in the heel, stamped in the center of their boat. He looks back to the treeline, then down the shore. He looks to his feet. The boys' shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud. Larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) What is it? \nELLIS \n(POINTING) I saw that same boot print up in the tree. It has a cross in the heel. Somebody's been in our boat. \nNECKBONE Shit. Let's go. Ellis begins following the boot prints around the shoreline. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) We gotta go if you wanna make it back. \n(NO RESPONSE) Your dad's gonna kick our ass. It'll take twice as long goin' up river. \nELLIS Hold it. \nEllis stops and points ahead of them. \nELLIS (CONT'D) Up there. They stop. Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print. They appear to vanish. \nNECKBONE Where the hell'd he go? \nELLIS I don't know. Neckbone turns and freezes. A MAN has appeared in the distance behind Ellis. He stands between the boys and their boat. Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns. He flinches at the sight of the Man. MUD(38) stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's fishing pole with cartoon characters on it. He stares back at them and casts his fishing line into the water. \nNECKBONE Shit. You know that guy? \nELLIS I've never seen him before. \nNECKBONE Shit. Mud, not taking his eyes off the boys, slowly reels in his line. His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of growth on his face. With a cigarette clinched, he cracks a smile revealing a MISSING CANINE. He holds a hand in the air as if to wave. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) Shit. Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back. Mud wears jeans and cowboy boots. His filthy button-up shirt looks like it hasn't left his body in years. He breaks his stare with the boys. Continuing to reel in his line, he walks over to them. \nMUD What you say? The boys don't respond. Mud walks past them and casts again. \nMUD (CONT'D) Helluva thing. \n", "test1_true": "MUD Boat in the trees. It's a helluva thing. Mud continues walking down the shoreline, reeling in his bait. The boys follow, tentatively. \nELLIS You talkin' 'bout our boat? \nMUD I'm talkin' about my boat. \nNECKBONE We found it. \nMUD You found it with me livin' in it. Possession is nine tenths of the law. \nNECKBONE So? \nMUD Don't tell me you boys are from Mississippi? \nELLIS No. They watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and spits on it. Then, tucking the pole under his arm, he ties a lock of his hair into a knot. He finishes this process with another cast. \nELLIS (CONT'D) You got crosses in your heels. \nMUD Nails. Shaped liked crosses. \nELLIS What for? \nMUD Ward off evil spirits. A man I called an Indian but was Meskin said they were Seven-league boots worn by the seventh son of a seventh son. Told me it'd turn me into a werewolf but that's a lie. I don't know nothin' about that. Ellis, confused, won't take his eyes off the man. \nMUD (CONT'D) They just good luck, but so far they ain't been workin' too well. (missing tooth smile) What's your name? Mud seems easy to smile, which softens his otherwise coarse look. His words spill from the mouth rapidly, without much thought for punctuation. Neckbone, emboldened by these facts, steps forward to answer. \nNECKBONE I'm Neckbone, he's Ellis, and mister you may be stone ass crazy but I know you're not the owner of that boat, not for nine tenths of nothin'. \nMUD Neckbone? That's a real handle son. Where ya'll from? \nNECKBONE What do you care where we're from? \nELLIS DeWitt. Neckbone looks at Ellis, frustrated by his friend. \nMUD Arkansas boys. Ya'll had me worried for a second. Mud, pleased by this news, tucks the fishing pole under his arm and holds out a hand to shake. Ellis stares at the hand, unsure. He takes it reluctantly. \nELLIS We s'posed to know you? \nMUD I doubt it. I grew up `round here, but I've been gone awhile. \nELLIS Where around here? \nMUD Different places. Spent a lot of time back up near the White. \nELLIS You know Shelly's Oxbow? Neckbone can't believe his friend is offering this up. \nNECKBONE Ellis. We gotta go. \nMUD I know it. Guy named Tom Blankenship used to live back in there. \nELLIS He still does. His boat's cross from mine. Mud smiles. \nMUD Ain't that somethin'. In one motion, Mud flicks his cigarette away and grabs a pack out of his shirt pocket. \nMUD (CONT'D) I like you two. You remind me of me. And seeing how you boys are from Arkansas and we know some people and sounds like we all from the same place I'd say we can make a deal here about somethin'. \nELLIS A deal for what? \nMUD Food. Food for a boat. \nNECKBONE This guy's a bum Ellis. Come on. Mud's smile vanishes. Neckbone begins to walk off but begrudgingly stops when Ellis starts back in. \nELLIS Why don't you go get your own food? \nMUD I would if I could, but I told somebody I'd meet `em here. So I'm stuck for now and what I got's runnin' low. Neckbone walks back and pulls Ellis by the arm. \nNECKBONE He's a bum Ellis, let's go. Mud lays a serious look down on Neckbone. \nMUD I'm no bum. I got money. You can call me a hobo `cause a hobo'll work for his living and you can call me homeless `cause that's true for now, but if you call me a bum again I'll have to teach you somethin' about respect that your daddy never did. Neckbone's confidence recedes. Ellis stands his ground. \nELLIS When they show up, you'll leave? Mud begins fishing again. \nMUD Yeah. \n", "test1_id": 444, "test2_input": "CARVER (CONT'D) This is my father, King. He runs the show. Carver recedes as King steps forward. He speaks like a high school football coach. \nKING Men. I wanna thank you for the work you're doin'. It's important work, and I want you to know what it means to me personally. I'm grateful for it. No man should have to bury his son. It's not natural, and it's a pain I hope none of you ever have to endure. King removes a photocopied picture of Mud from his pocket. He unfolds it, stares at it, then raises it to the men. \nKING (CONT'D) This man did that to me. He took my youngest boy. And now, you're gonna help me get him. King stares at the men, keeping the photo held high. \nKING (CONT'D) Now gather `round. Come on now, in a circle. I want ya'll to join hands. They do it reluctantly. \nKING (CONT'D) Everybody take a knee. They do. King joins them on his knee and grabs Carver and another Man's hands. \nKING (CONT'D) Bow your heads. I need you to help me pray for the death of the man that killed my son. They all bow their heads. \nA85 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - MORNING A85 \nA tarp is thrown back from a rusting boat trailer. Ellis and Neckbone stand by the trailer looking less than thrilled. It's covered in junk and debris. \nNECKBONE You touch her breast? \nELLIS A little. \nNECKBONE That's great man. \nELLIS Thanks. Ellis walks up and knocks a stack of bricks off the trailer. \nELLIS (CONT'D) We could take it apart. Bring it out piece by piece. \nNECKBONE It's welded. We'd just tear it up. What if we float it out? \nELLIS With what? \nNECKBONE Come on. Neckbone walks to the trailer. Ellis follows. \nB85 INT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS B85 \nThe boys open the front door and are met by a BLINDING LIGHT. \nNECKBONE Jesus! They squint and shield their eyes. The light shuts off as quickly as it came on. Galen stands in front of them wearing his wet suit. The bar with the flood lights attached sits across his shoulders. The boys rub their eyeballs, seeing spots. Galen shuffles over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the lights. He labors to take a seat. \nGALEN What do you think? \n79A. \nNECKBONE That's real good Galen. \n(TO ELLIS) Gimme a minute. Neckbone, still blinking, goes back to his room. Ellis notices Galen staring at him. Galen pats the couch. \nGALEN Come `ere Ellis. Ellis takes a seat on the other end of the couch. Galen pats the spot next to him. Ellis scoots over, uncomfortable. \nGALEN (CONT'D) \n(POINTING UP) You see that ceiling fan? \nELLIS Yeah. \nGALEN I found it in the river. Works great. Best ceiling fan I've ever owned. This river brings a lotta trash down it. Some a that trash is worth a lotta money, some of it's not. You gotta know what's worth keepin' and what's worth lettin' go. You know the difference? \nELLIS I think so. \nGALEN Neck looks up to you. Don't get my nephew into anything you can't get him out of. Galen forces a stare with Ellis, who nods. Neckbone enters as Galen begins to remove his light rig. \nGALEN (CONT'D) Help Me Rhonda's just about a guy needing to get a piece to get over a girl that put one over on him. So you get your heart broke, don't walk around with a shit look on your face. Get back in there. Get your tip wet. You hear me? \nELLIS What? \nGALEN You know what I'm sayin'. \n79B. \nEllis doesn't. Galen moves to an electric guitar leaning by a small amp in the corner. \nGALEN (CONT'D) Ya'll wanna hang out? Alan's comin' over. We're gonna pump it up. \nNECKBONE We got stuff to do. \n", "test2_true": "C85 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS C85 \nGalen pumps it up inside as Neckbone and Ellis walk to the boat trailer. Neckbone pulls a handful of long zip ties from his back pocket. \nNECKBONE What were ya'll talkin' about? \nELLIS I don't know. \n86 EXT. ISLAND NORTHERN SHORE - DAY 86 \nMud's knife slices through a plastic zip tie. \nMUD King. That's what they call him. A BOAT TRAILER rests atop FOUR, 55-GALLON BRIGHT YELLOW BARRELS affixed with plastic zip ties. The make-shift raft is half on shore with the back still floating in the water. The boys watch as Mud walks around the trailer cutting off the zip ties. The barrels kick out from underneath the trailer as this happens. \nMUD (CONT'D) He's their father. You didn't go near him did you? \nELLIS No. \nMUD Good. That left-handed sonofabitch is the devil himself. If he's here, then it's time. We need to get Juniper out here. \n79C. \nELLIS We still need a motor. \nNECKBONE There's a motor in the scrap yard might work. \nMUD I need one that runs. Mud moves to the front of the boat trailer and begins dragging it fully onto the bank. It's heavy. \nNECKBONE I can get it runnin'. Tell him Ellis. \nELLIS It's true. He built his own dirt bike. \nMUD All right then. Give it a shot. \nELLIS I don't know. That motor's worth somethin'. It's not like this other junk. \nNECKBONE It's been there for months. Nobody's even gonna know it's gone. Ellis hesitates. He looks to Mud. \nMUD We do need a motor. Ellis thinks on it as Mud takes a deep breath and grabs the trailer again. \n87 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - DAY 87 \nThe supermarket is busy. Ellis stands at a pay phone out front as Neckbone kicks a vending machine nearby. Ellis looks at Juniper's motel. He scans the Piggly Wiggly parking lot and spots Carver's black Lincoln. Ellis picks up the phone and deposits some change. He dials. \nELLIS I wanna talk to room 212. \n88 I/E. JUNIPER'S MOTEL ROOM/PIGGLY WIGGLY - CONTINUOUS 88 Juniper watches TV (o.s) at the foot of the bed. The phone rings. She snaps up, hits mute and grabs it. \nJUNIPER Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH ELLIS, \nELLIS Juniper? \nJUNIPER Ellis? \nELLIS It's me. \nJUNIPER Thank god. I've been goin' crazy in this room. Is Mud okay? \nELLIS Yeah. It's time to take you out to him. \nJUNIPER Now? \nELLIS Tomorrow. We'll come get you. \nJUNIPER What's goin' on? \nELLIS He's got a plan for ya'll to get away. Be ready tomorrow at five. Neckbone'll be waitin' at the back of the motel with a dirt bike. \nJUNIPER They're watching my room. \nELLIS I'll take care of that. Just be ready at five. \n", "test2_id": 445, "test3_input": "Carver steps across the plank onto the houseboat followed by James. Carver motions him around back toward Ellis' window. \nCARVER Flush him out this way. Carver walks to the covered carport. \n152 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 152 \nIN THE DEN, The Hunters at the front door continue taking pot shots at the furniture. Mud flinches at each new round fired. \n153 IN ELLIS' ROOM, 153 \nEllis cautiously slides out from under his bed and crouches next to the bedroom door. He peeks through a crack. He sees Mud pinned behind the Lazy Boy. They make eye contact. Mud's eyes move to something behind Ellis. Ellis turns to see James passing by his bedroom window. \n154 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 154 \nTom scans Ellis' boat through the scope on his rifle. He sees Carver creeping around the carport. He pans right to find James taking a position near the patio doors. Tom pauses, seeing Ellis appear at the corner of the boat just behind James. \n155 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 155 \nThe firing from the front door has stopped. Mud takes a deep breath, sets the empty shotgun on the ground, then rushes out the sliding glass doors as the men out front reload. \n156 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/TOM'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 156 \nMud makes it outside, his back to James' leveled rifle. \nELLIS \nMUD! James and Mud both turn at the sound of Ellis' voice. One of Tom's bullets drops James dead. Carver appears at the carport end of the boat. He raises his shotgun toward Mud. \nA156 ON TOM, A156 He snaps the bolt open and closed, but it jams. He jerks at the lever, looking up he sees Carver taking aim. \n157 ON MUD, 157 Mud takes a running leap off the side of the boat. Carver FIRES. Mud is struck in the back by the shotgun blast. The force of the shot spins him in the air. He crashes into the water. Ellis screams. \nELLIS (CONT'D) \nMUD! Carver approaches the edge of the boat. He stares down into the swirling dark water. No sign of Mud. \nA157 ON TOM, A157 Tom slaps open the bolt and yanks the spent cartridge out with his fingers. It BURNS. \nTOM \nDAMMIT! \nON CARVER, He pumps the shotgun and fires into the murky water. The pellets pepper the surface. Still no sign of Mud. Carver pumps the shotgun a final time, but before he can get another shot off Tom's bullet rips open Carver's chest sending him sprawling through the broken patio doors. \nON TOM, He exhales, shucks the bolt once more. His eyes scan the dark water. \n158 ON THE HOUSEBOAT, 158 Ellis runs to the edge of the boat. \nELLIS \nMUD! MUD! Senior exits the houseboat, pistol pointed. He sees Ellis and runs to him. \nSENIOR \nELLIS! Senior grabs the boy, keeping his pistol up. Ellis drops to his knees and Senior crouches with him, holding him tight in his arms. Ellis cries. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) It's okay. It's okay. The two sit alone on the edge of the houseboat. The river seems especially quiet now. \n159 I/E. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 159 The sky shows faint signs of morning, a few streaks of light. \nON THE RIVERBANK, The blue, red, and white lights from police cruisers and ambulances bounce up into the trees. A frenzy of Police activity swarms from the aftermath left on Ellis' houseboat. Men in wetsuits prepare a dive. Blanket covered bodies are wheeled off on gurneys. \nTwo of the Bounty Hunters, unharmed, sit locked in the back of a state trooper vehicle. \n160 ON THE HOUSEBOAT, 160 Ellis, Senior and Mary Lee sit huddled together under the carport. They watch the emergency workers stream past. Senior wraps his arms around them. Ellis looks across the bayou to Tom's boat. Police flashlights bob and weave throughout. No sign of Tom. \n161 INSIDE ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT, 161 A LOCAL OFFICER strings caution tape across the broken patio doors. TWO STATE TROOPERS hover over Carver's body. The Troopers step away and the Local Officer cranes toward the body. He studies Carver's face. Stepping aside, the Officer takes a cell phone from his pocket and dials. He turns his back away from the Troopers. \n162 INT. PINES MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 162 \nThe phone rings in the Pines Motel. King enters from the adjoining room and takes a seat on the bed. He answers. \nKING Hello...You're speaking to him... King listens. His face taut. \n", "test3_true": "163 EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 163 \nIt's dark on the river. Moonlight barely shows the ripples in the slow moving current. MUSIC from a country station slips out across the surface of the water. Galen's jambox sits next to a small lantern in his flat- bottom boat. His Helper snores, fully reclined, with an empty can of Budweiser resting on his gut. His feet are propped next to a tiny bell rigged to a line that disappears into the water. The bell RINGS. \n164 EXT. UNDERWATER - RIVER - NIGHT 164 \nThe river bed swirls inside two, distinct spots of light. \nGalen, using his new diving lights, scoops a final mussel shell into the net before tying it off. He tugs at the line. It's pitch black save for the shafts of light projected from Galen's shoulders. He tilts the lights toward the surface. The line leading up to the bottom of the boat dances in and out of the high beams. Then... \nMUD'S BODY FLOATS BY OVERHEAD. Only his backside is visible. A cloud of blood trails from the holes there. \nFADE TO BLACK. \n165 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DAY 165 \nA WORKER cinches a thick strap across the deck of Ellis' houseboat. \n166 ON THE RIVERBANK, 166 Ellis watches as WORKERS affix straps from his houseboat to a crane resting in the bed of a large truck on the bank. The SOUND of Neckbone's dirt bike rattles through the trees. He appears behind Ellis and parks. \nNECKBONE Hey. \nELLIS You got your bike back. \nNECKBONE Mud dinged the shit out of it. Neckbone takes a seat next to Ellis. They watch the workers. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) They're really doin' it. \nELLIS It's the law. \nNECKBONE It's bullshit. They ever find Tom? The boys focus on Tom Blankenship's boat across the bayou. It sits vacant, covered in police tape. \nELLIS No. He's gone. \nNECKBONE Your dad not here? \nELLIS Said he couldn't watch it. He's pickin' me up in a minute. Got deliveries today. They sit in silence as the Workers exit off the houseboat. \nNECKBONE Heard on the news. They still hadn't found Mud's body. Ellis nods. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) You think he's dead? \nELLIS I don't know. I hope not. The crane begins lifting up the houseboat. The metal wires tighten and the entire structure creaks. A sucking sound as the flotilla separate from the water. The boat hangs, suspended in the air. A HORN HONKS behind the boys. Ellis turns to see Senior's truck. \nELLIS (CONT'D) I gotta go. Come by the apartment. Help me set my room up. \nNECKBONE All right. Neckbone watches Ellis climb into the bed of the pick-up and take his spot on the coolers. The sound of twisting metal shifts his attention back to the houseboat being swung over a flatbed semi. \n167 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 167 \nIN THE CAB, Senior glances at the houseboat being set on the flatbed. He puts the truck in reverse and pulls away. Not looking back. \n168 EXT.

FLEA MARKET - DAY B168 \nEllis and his father unload a cooler at the back of a tented flea market. A WOMAN comes out to greet them. \n169 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/NEW APARTMENTS - DAY 169 Senior's truck pulls into the parking lot of a newly finished apartment complex. The two-story buildings are modest. The truck idles out front. \nINSIDE THE CAB, Ellis grabs the door handle. He turns to Senior. \nELLIS I'll see you next week? \nSENIOR Yeah. Ellis begins to get out but stops when Senior speaks. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) Ellis? You mind your mother okay? This is a big change for her. She needs your support. \nELLIS Yessir. \nSENIOR All right.

{"train": "MUD \nWritten by \nJeff Nichols \nShooting Script September 16, 2011 \n1 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - PREDAWN 1 \nELLIS(14) sits fully-clothed on top of his made bed. He is a wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip struggling desperately to be a mustache. His room, cluttered with junk, is dark, quiet and tiny. A backpack and an oversized Walkie-Talkie sit next to him. The silence is cut by a SQUAWK from the Walkie. Ellis quickly grabs it. \nELLIS I'm comin' out now. \nHe crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over his shoulder. On his feet, he slides open a window at the foot of his bed. He's out in one motion. \n2 EXT. HOUSEBOAT - PREDAWN 2 \nEllis skirts alongside the exterior wall of his room on a two- foot-wide section of decking. He lives on a HOUSEBOAT anchored just off the bank of the Arkansas River. The \"boat\" is really the combination of a double wide trailer and a vinyl-sided shack fused together atop large flotilla. Ellis scurries to the mobile home section of the boat. He slips past a barbecue grill and settles underneath a lighted window. VOICES come from inside. Slowly, Ellis gets on his toes to peer through the window. \n3 INT. ELLIS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 3 \nMARY LEE(41) takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator. SENIOR(52) sits at a small table reading a newspaper. The mobile home kitchenette is no larger than Ellis' room. \nMARY LEE I just want to have a conversation. I just want to talk about it. \nMary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up from his paper. Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger toward him. \nMARY LEE (CONT'D) If you don't look up from that goddamn paper... \nShe stops before completing the thought. After a moment, Senior lowers his paper. He stares across the table at his wife. He looks at her with true disdain. \nHis eyes trace down her face and robe before finally settling on his cup of coffee. He picks up the cup, takes a sip, and sets it back on the table. He raises the paper up. Mary Lee's eyes soften. She bites the inside of her cheek to keep from crying. Her eyes move to the kitchen window. \n4 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 4 \nEllis quickly ducks and mouths the word \"shit.\" He slips under the window toward a metal carport that covers a boat, fish cleaning station, and industrial ice machine. The entire houseboat is anchored to the shore by two thick ropes tied to opposite ends of the flotilla. The ropes extend upward into the tops of enormous pine trees. Ellis sprints across a simple, wood-planked bridge to shore. His houseboat is one of several in a row along the riverbank. \n5 EXT. ELLIS' RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 5 \nEllis scurries into the treeline and arrives at a dirt path. Waiting for him there is NECKBONE(14), a scrawny kid with slicked back blonde hair wearing a FUGAZI T-shirt. He sits atop a smallish dirt bike. Ellis hops on the back. \nNECKBONE What the shit man? \nELLIS Suck it. Drive. The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail. \n6 EXT. RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 6 \nFrom a distance, the single headlight of the dirt bike snakes up and down, in and out of trees along the riverbank. \nON THE BIKE, The sound of the engine rips through fog and trees illuminated by the straining headlight. \n7 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAWN 7 \nThe boys emerge from behind a sand covered hill. Now on foot, they are silhouetted against a light blue, morning sky. \nNECKBONE How old is she? \nELLIS A Junior. \nAt a collection of trees growing out of the water, the boys move branches away from a tarp covered boat. \nNECKBONE She's got nice titties. You talk to her? \nELLIS Nah. \nNECKBONE You're gonna have to talk to her. \nELLIS I know. \nNECKBONE Remind me when we get back to my house, Galen's got a book on that. Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small, flat-bottom boat. Ellis, a foot on the bank and one in the boat, launches them out into the water. \n8 EXT. RIVER - MORNING 8 \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) Aw shit. \nAs he scrambles to gather the fallen pages, Ellis notices a dried BOOT PRINT next to his foot. He lowers his shoe from the cabinet leaving a smaller, muddy print of his own. He leans in to examine the larger print. The impression of a CROSS has been left in the heel. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) Her tits are so small. Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the cross marking. His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin. On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty cans of Beanie Weenie. In the booth, he sees a grocery bag. Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it. \nELLIS Neck. \nNECKBONE Look at that beave. You gotta see this. Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag. His fingers pull back the edges to reveal its contents: one can of unopened Beanie Weenie and half a loaf of BREAD. \nELLIS Neck. Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze. It's FRESH. Ellis freezes. \nNECKBONE What? \nELLIS Someone's here. \nNECKBONE What? Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone. \nELLIS Someone's livin' here. Neckbone sees the grocery bag. His eyes widen. The boys are stone frozen. They listen for other sounds. Silence. \nBEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Both boys flinch at the sharp sounds. Neckbone's hand flies to cover the alarm on his wristwatch. \nNECKBONE Shit. \nELLIS We gotta go. I can't be late. \n15 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - MOMENTS LATER 15 \nThey drop out of the tree and hit the ground running. \n16 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - MOMENTS LATER 16 \nThe boys' feet rush across the tree trunk bridging the creek. \n17 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - MOMENTS LATER 17 \nThey launch out of the treeline and sprint to their boat. Neckbone grabs the side and starts pushing the boat to the water. Ellis slings his backpack in and joins him. Suddenly, Ellis straightens up, leaving Neckbone to struggle. \nNECKBONE What are you doing? Ellis stares at a muddy boot print, cross in the heel, stamped in the center of their boat. He looks back to the treeline, then down the shore. He looks to his feet. The boys' shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud. Larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) What is it? \nELLIS \n(POINTING) I saw that same boot print up in the tree. It has a cross in the heel. Somebody's been in our boat. \nNECKBONE Shit. Let's go. Ellis begins following the boot prints around the shoreline. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) We gotta go if you wanna make it back. \n(NO RESPONSE) Your dad's gonna kick our ass. It'll take twice as long goin' up river. \nELLIS Hold it. \nEllis stops and points ahead of them. \nELLIS (CONT'D) Up there. They stop. Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print. They appear to vanish. \nNECKBONE Where the hell'd he go? \nELLIS I don't know. Neckbone turns and freezes. A MAN has appeared in the distance behind Ellis. He stands between the boys and their boat. Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns. He flinches at the sight of the Man. MUD(38) stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's fishing pole with cartoon characters on it. He stares back at them and casts his fishing line into the water. \nNECKBONE Shit. You know that guy? \nELLIS I've never seen him before. \nNECKBONE Shit. Mud, not taking his eyes off the boys, slowly reels in his line. His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of growth on his face. With a cigarette clinched, he cracks a smile revealing a MISSING CANINE. He holds a hand in the air as if to wave. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) Shit. Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back. Mud wears jeans and cowboy boots. His filthy button-up shirt looks like it hasn't left his body in years. He breaks his stare with the boys. Continuing to reel in his line, he walks over to them. \nMUD What you say? The boys don't respond. Mud walks past them and casts again. \nMUD (CONT'D) Helluva thing. \nELLIS And when you leave, that boat's ours? \nMUD Yeah. Ellis studies Mud's face, clothes, tattoos. He's thinking about it. Mud pauses from fishing to make eye contact. \nMUD (CONT'D) I'm in a tight spot. I just need a little help. \nELLIS We gotta go. With that, Ellis turns to leave. The boys walk briskly back to their boat. Ellis looks over his shoulder to see Mud making another cast with his fishing pole. \n18 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MOMENTS LATER 18 \nEllis motors them away from the island. \nELLIS You get his name?! \nNECKBONE No! Ellis looks back. Mud has disappeared. \n19 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DAY 19 \nSenior heaves an enormous, white cooler into the bed of his weathered pick-up truck. The truck is parked at an angle on a concrete boat ramp next to their houseboat. The bed of the truck is jam-packed with six of the big, white coolers. The SOUND of a dirt bike rattles through the trees. Senior looks up, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. Ellis leaps out of the treeline and runs to the pick-up. His hands hit his knees, out of breath. \nELLIS I'm sorry. \nSENIOR Where you been? \nELLIS Neck and I got caught up helpin' Galen. \nSENIOR You're s'posed to be helpin' me. I had to load this myself. \nELLIS I know, I'm sorry. \nSENIOR Just get in the back. Can't be later than we are. \nELLIS Yessir. Senior flips up the tailgate. Ellis hops up the wheel well and into the bed of the truck. He steadies himself on one of the coolers as his father pulls away. \nEXT. DEWITT/MONTAGE - DAY \nSERIES OF IMAGES: \n20 -Ellis looks around as he rides in the bed of the pick-up 20 truck. He's propped up on a cooler against the back window. The truck works its way down a two-lane highway. A20 -Driving, they pass a marina junkyard filled with old boats A20 and sailing paraphernalia. B20 -Downtown Dewitt. A gas station. A Clinic. Rows of red B20 brick buildings, some abandoned, a small furniture store. C20 -Parked, Ellis fills a grocery sack up with Ziplock bags fullC20 of white fish and ice out of the coolers. -He hops out of the truck and runs the sack of fish to the front door of a house. An elderly black man waits there. \n21 EXT. SONIC DRIVE-IN - DAY 21 \nEllis sits in the bed of the truck eating a chili dog. Senior is up front wolfing down a cheeseburger. A GROUP of TEENAGERS are gathered around a CLUSTER of parked cars in the corner of the lot. They meander between the vehicles, smoking, gossiping, passing around a bottle of Boone's Farm. Ellis watches them. MAY PEARL(16) appears in the middle of the Group laughing with her GIRLFRIENDS. She's pretty and physically more mature looking than Ellis. He watches as a SKINNY KID takes his ballcap off and puts it on May Pearl's head. She sniffs the cap, gags and tosses it back at him. Her friends laugh. \nSENIOR Let's go son. Ellis crumples the wrapper to his finished hotdog and jumps down from the bed of the truck. \n22 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/TWO-LANE ROAD - MOVING - DAY 22 Ellis rides up front with his father. Senior is a reserved man, older than Ellis' mother by several years. He's got thinning hair under the cap that only leaves his head when he sleeps. He reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a fold of cash. He slips out a five dollar bill and hands it to Ellis. \nELLIS It's s'posed to be ten. \nSENIOR It's ten you do your share. I loaded this mornin'. That makes it five. Ellis begrudgingly stuffs the five in his jeans. \nELLIS You drop me at Neck's? Senior checks his pants pockets, feels around under his seat. \nSENIOR Hadn't you seen enougha him today? \nELLIS Said he had something for me. \nSENIOR You see anymore Ding Dongs over there? Ellis checks under his seat and pulls out a half-empty box of Ding Dongs. Hands one over to his father who rips the package with his teeth. \nELLIS What'd Momma wanna talk to you about? \nSENIOR What? \nELLIS This mornin', what'd she wanna talk with you about? \nSENIOR You spy on me in my own house? \nELLIS I wasn't spyin', just heard ya'll. \nSENIOR That's your mother's business. Senior makes this his answer, eats the Ding Dong. \n23 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - DAY 23 \nNECKBONE You really going back out there? \nELLIS I think it's the right thing to do. \nNECKBONE Well...I'll be over in the mornin' then. Galen, his thumbs tucked under his armpits, walks back to the trailer. He passes the boys and notices the self-help book in Ellis' hands. \nGALEN \n(WITHOUT STOPPING) That's a good book. Be sure you do the worksheets in the back. Let's get some dinner Neck. Galen's gone inside. \nNECKBONE I'll call 'fore I come. \nELLIS All right. Neckbone follows his uncle into the trailer. Ellis flips through his new book as he heads out of the trailer park. \n26 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 26 \nBy the time Ellis makes it to his houseboat, the sun has disappeared behind the horizon. He crosses the make-shift plank and enters through a screen door by the carport. \n27 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 27 \nMary Lee flinches when she sees Ellis come through the door. Her face is flushed. Senior stands toe to toe with her. They stare at Ellis, who has paused in the doorway. He doesn't say anything, just looks curiously at his parents. Senior storms past Ellis and is out the door. Ellis steps further into the den. Mary Lee tries to straighten herself, patting down her hair and dabbing at her eyes with the back of her hand. \nELLIS You okay momma? \nMARY LEE Yes. \nShe walks into the kitchen keeping Ellis at her back. She turns on the sink and begins scrubbing at a dish. \nMARY LEE (CONT'D) Do you need me to fix you somethin'? Have you eaten? \nELLIS I'm all right. Mary Lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the sink. She turns to Ellis. \nMARY LEE I'm gonna turn in. \nELLIS Okay momma. Mary Lee slips past him and enters her bedroom. The door closes and Ellis is left alone in the den. It's quiet. He waits, looking at the door his mother just closed. Ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door. Checking over his shoulder, he zips his backpack open and fills it with CANNED FOOD. \n28 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - DAY 28 \nHands pump the stock of a high-powered pellet gun. TOM BLANKENSHIP(67), white hair cut high and tight wearing a short-sleeve button up, takes careful aim with the pellet gun. Tom sits in a lawn chair atop the roof of his houseboat. He squeezes his left eye shut. A snake's head pokes out of the water about 15 yards off his boat. The head makes for a target no bigger than a thumb. Tom's left eye snaps open and he fires. The pellet rips through the snake's head. Its body floats to the surface. Tom takes account of his shot as he pumps the air rifle. He scans the water for more targets. \n29 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 29 \nEllis watches Tom Blankenship from across the bayou. Tom's boat sits directly opposite Ellis', separated by 30 yards of muddy brown water. Ellis leans against a post under the carport. His backpack resting at his feet, he holds the Walkie-Talkie in his hand. Senior works behind him washing utensils in the outdoor sink. \nELLIS What do you know about Tom Blankenship? \nSENIOR What? Senior doesn't turn around from his work at the sink. \nELLIS Mr. Blankenship, what do you know about him? \nSENIOR Why? \nELLIS I don't know. He looks lonely over there. \nSENIOR Some people move to this river to work on it, and some move here to be left alone. Senior makes his way to the ice machine and begins scooping ice into a large white cooler. Mary Lee emerges from the houseboat dressed for work, a secretarial job. Senior stops what he's doing to watch her. She walks over to Ellis. \nMARY LEE Let's sit down for dinner tonight okay? Will you make it home by seven? \nELLIS Yes ma'am. She walks off the boat without a glance in Senior's direction. He trails her with his eyes before going back to digging in the ice. A29 Ellis looks back at Tom. The Walkie SQUAWKS out several A29 loud BEEPS. Ellis crams it in his backpack and runs off the boat. \nELLIS (CONT'D) Bye Dad. Senior holds a hand up but never looks up from his work. \n30 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 30 \nWater laps at the shore of the island. Ellis and Neckbone drag their boat onto the muddy bank. \nNECKBONE Where you think he's at? \nELLIS I guess we should try the boat. They head for the treeline. \n31 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 31 \nThe boys emerge from the woods, their attention focused up to the boat hovering in the tree some twenty feet above them. Ellis notices the remnants of a fire on the ground. A log pushed up next to it for a seat. Ellis kicks at the ash. \nNECKBONE What'd they do? \nMUD Gave me antivenom. For a cotton mouth. See here. Mud shows the tattoo on top of his right hand. He points out the two cotton blossoms bulging from the snake's mouth. \nMUD (CONT'D) Problem with antivenom is they can only give it to you once. It's made from horse blood. Your body would reject it a second time. The cure ends up being more dangerous than the poison. \nELLIS What happens if you get bit again? \nMUD I die, or just sweat it out. Neckbone, not buying it, looks at Ellis and taps his watch. \nELLIS We gotta go help Neck's uncle. \nMUD All right. \nELLIS You never said your name. \nMUD Mud. You can call me Mud. \nELLIS Mud? \nMUD \nM-U-D. Neckbone tosses the braided rope back. It lands at his feet. \nNECKBONE Here you go, Mud. I think you need that worse than I do. \nMUD \n(SMILING) I'll be all right. The boys disappear back into the trees. \n34 INT. GARY'S ELECTRIC SHOP - DAY 34 \nA switch clicks \"ON\". BLINDING LIGHT emits from two FLOOD LAMPS encased in plastic shells. The switch clicks \"OFF\" and the lights dim to the dull orange glow of their filaments. \nGALEN They look bright enough. The owner of the shop, an ELECTRICIAN(62), holds up a metal bar with the lamps affixed by bolts at either end. \nELECTRICIAN Should be. I rigged DC power up through marine batteries. Makes it portable. Gave you a rigging bar to set on your shoulder. \nGALEN So you really think these'll work under water? \nELECTRICIAN In theory. \n35 EXT. GARY'S ELECTRIC/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 35 \nEllis and Neckbone sit on the tailgate of Galen's truck. The Gary's Electric sign hangs behind them. Neckbone focuses on a carburetor in his hand. Ellis stares across the street at the Piggly Wiggly parking lot where the roving GROUP of TEENAGERS have collected for the afternoon. The Teenagers are up to their typical gossip and minor offenses. Ellis has zeroed in on May Pearl again. \nNECKBONE You start datin' I bet her dad'll give you a free pick-up truck. \nELLIS I don't care about that. Ellis watches as the same Skinny Kid from before tries to flirt with her. She's not having it. He pops her bra strap before landing the final straw, a smack on her ass. She turns and swats at him. Seeing this, Ellis is on his feet and crossing the street. \nNECKBONE What's goin' on? Ellis doesn't turn back. Neckbone reluctantly sets the carburetor down and follows. \n36 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 36 \nMAY PEARL Stop it! She shoves the Skinny Kid, but he continues laughing. \nELLIS (O.S.) Hey. Ellis taps the Kid on the shoulder. As he turns, Ellis PUNCHES him in the face. The Kid, completely taken off guard, stumbles and trips to the ground. Some older, tougher looking GUYS see this and begin laughing at him. \nOLDER KID Holy shit Pryor, get off your ass. Pryor collects himself and gets off the ground. Ego bruised, he walks off mumbling. The Older Kids keep riding him. May Pearl sizes up Ellis. \nMAY PEARL You didn't have to do that. \nELLIS He was messin' with you. \nMAY PEARL Do I know you? \nELLIS I'm Ellis. That's Neck. Neckbone waves by wagging a finger in the air. \nELLIS (CONT'D) We went to Junior High with you, before you went to High School. \nMAY PEARL How old are you? \nELLIS Fourteen. \nBy the time Ellis makes it back home, the sun has gone from the sky. He crosses the makeshift plank to board his house. \nSENIOR (O.S.) Home for dinner? Ellis is startled by his father's voice. Senior sits in a lawn chair under the eaves of the carport. He's hidden in shadow, save for a red glow from the tip of his cigarette. \nELLIS What you hidin' for? \nSENIOR I ain't hidin'. He notices Senior tip back a pint of liquor and set it at his feet. Ellis opens the screen door leading inside. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) Come over here. Ellis lets the door fall shut and skulks over to a beam that supports the carport. He leans into it. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) You know I love you? \nELLIS Yessir. I know. \nSENIOR I work you hard 'cause life is work. You know that? \nELLIS Yessir. \nSENIOR Your Mamma's been talkin' 'bout movin' in town. \nELLIS What's that mean? \nSENIOR She seems set on it. Wants to separate. She may ask me for a divorce. This hits Ellis like a ton of bricks. He rights himself. \nELLIS What's that mean for me? \nSENIOR It means enjoy the river son. Enjoy it while you live on it, 'cause this way a life isn't long for this world. Game and fish's 'bout made certain of that. \nELLIS But you and me can still live out here. Game and fish can't take your boat. Not while you're still in it. \nSENIOR The houseboat's in your mother's name. Her daddy give it to her not me. If she wants to leave it, Game and Fish has ever' right to take this boat apart board by board. \nELLIS But that ain't right. You work outta here. We got the ice machine, the traps. What are we supposed to do? \nSENIOR Like I said, this is your mother's business. \nELLIS I ain't no townie. I ain't livin' like that. Senior takes a slow pull off the bottle. Ellis' mind races. \nSENIOR I've let you down. A man should be in charge of his own affairs, but I haven't worked it like that. \nELLIS But ya'll are married. Ya'll are s'posed to love each other. \nSENIOR I don't know about that anymore. \nEllis is speechless. After a moment, he turns to go inside. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) Ellis? He stops and turns back to his father. Senior tries to express a sentiment he doesn't have the words for. Ellis continues inside. \n40 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 40 \nMary Lee sits hunched at the made dinner table. She runs her finger around the rim of a half empty glass of iced tea. It's a full spread with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and a salad. The table is set for two. She's been waiting. Ellis lets the front door slam shut behind him. She sits up. \nMARY LEE You're late. Ellis doesn't speak, he doesn't look at her. He enters his room and shuts the door. He's heard the news and she knows it. Mary Lee's face drops. \n41 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41 \nEllis slings his backpack down, pacing the small room. He stops and leans his forehead against the door. The sound of his Mother clearing the table seeps through. He kicks the door, cracking its shitty composite wood. His face flushed and his breathing heavy, he slides to a seat. On the verge of hyperventilating, he stares out the dark bedroom window trying to get control of his breathing. Ellis looks at his backpack. It has spilled open revealing a can of Beanie Weenie. Ellis studies the can. He looks back to the window. His breathing settles. Quickly, he scoops up the backpack and heads out the window. \n42 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 42 \nIt's pitch black. The only light comes from the moon's reflection off the surface of the water. Ellis, eyes wide, navigates the small boat through choppy black water. \n43 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 43 \nEllis struggles to pull the boat onto shore. Leaving it half in the water, Ellis looks around. No sign of Mud. He sizes up the dark woods. He removes a flashlight from his backpack and shines it down the shorelines. Still nothing. Ellis follows the beam of light into the woods. \n44 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - NIGHT 44 \nEllis stands at the creek that cuts through the island. He can make out a campfire glowing through trees in the distance. A RUSTLING behind him. He swings the light around. Nothing but trees. Ellis takes a deep breath. Finding the log to cross, he shines his light down into the creek. The nest of snakes show their backs. \n45 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - NIGHT 45 \nA campfire burns at the base of the tree. The firelight illuminates the belly of the boat that rests 20 feet above. Ellis, his flashlight off, crouches behind a tree and watches the campsite. There is no one there. He looks into the black forest behind him, thinks of going back. A twig snaps in the distance and he's back on guard. Ellis nervously scans the woods before finally stepping into the light of the campfire. The SOUND of a gun's hammer drawing back CLICKS behind him. Ellis freezes. Mud emerges from the trees, a .45 extended toward Ellis' back. \nMUD No. We picked another place to meet. Couple days from now. Mud walks back to the log and sits. \nELLIS You wanna go tonight? I can give you a ride up river. Mud looks at Ellis, nodding. \nMUD Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow. \nELLIS You need me to come get you? \nMUD Naw. I can manage. Hell I got out here didn't I? Ellis smiles. They sit in silence. Ellis stares up at the boat hanging over them, its peeling hull lit by the firelight. Mud pinches the ash from the end of his cigarette, places the stub back in his shirt pocket. Noticing Ellis, Mud tilts his head back to take in the boat. \nMUD (CONT'D) It's a helluva thing. Mud pauses, his mind working on something. \nMUD (CONT'D) Helluva thing. The two sit by the campfire staring up at the suspended boat. \n46 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - MORNING 46 \nMary Lee knocks on her way into the bedroom. \nMARY LEE Time to get up. She begins picking clothes off the floor. Ellis, in bed, raises up on his elbows. He's tired from a late night. \nELLIS It's Saturday. \nMARY LEE I'm going to Wal-Mart. I need you to come with me. \nELLIS \n(MOANING) Mom. \nMARY LEE Come on. She pulls the covers off of him. \n47 I/E. MARY LEE'S CAR/INTERSTATE - DAY 47 The two ride in an awkward silence. \nEllis stares at the farmland passing by outside as Mary Lee steers the compact Toyota down a four-lane interstate. \nMARY LEE Ellis I know what your father told you last night. That's not what I wanted. I wanted to sit you down and talk about it. \nELLIS What do you wanna talk about? You want to leave and that means they can tear up our house. \nMARY LEE I've spent my whole life on that boat. I don't think it's too much to ask for your... Mary Lee is interrupted by a line of traffic backed up in front of her. She slows to a stop. \nMARY LEE (CONT'D) Oh no. I hope no one's hurt. There are flashing police lights up ahead. Ellis tries to see what's going on but can't make anything out past the line of cars. They inch forward. \nMARY LEE (CONT'D) I'm just saying there are two sides to this. I haven't made up my mind about anything because I want you to be involved in my decision, but I need a change Ellis. I deserve one. As they approach the flashing lights, they see three State Trooper vehicles parked to funnel traffic down to one lane. The STATE TROOPERS stop each car, checking the trunks. \nMARY LEE (CONT'D) I think they're searching people. A Trooper signals Mary Lee to pull up to a stop. Two other Troopers approach her vehicle. The first begins looking in her back windows as the second leans down to speak to her. She lowers her window. \nTROOPER Can you open the trunk please ma'am? \nMARY LEE Of course. \nMary Lee pulls the lever by her knee, and the second Trooper walks around the back of the car. \nTROOPER Have you picked up or seen any hitchhikers today ma'am? \nMARY LEE No sir. The Trooper produces a flier with a color photo on it. \nTROOPER Have you seen this man? \nMARY LEE No sir. The Trooper leans over and holds the paper out to Ellis. \nTROOPER Son, have you seen this man? Ellis looks at the photo. It's of Mud. He looks exactly the same as he did last night, down to the shirt. In the photo, Mud's smiling, revealing his missing tooth. \nELLIS No. \nTROOPER We've had reports that he's in this area. If you see him, call 9-1-1 immediately. \nMARY LEE We will officer. The Trooper pulls his head from the window. \nELLIS What'd he do?! The Trooper bends back down and looks at Ellis. \nELLIS (CONT'D) \n(MORE CALM) What'd he do? \nMUD Sir. They stare at each other for a long moment. Neither one flinching. \nBY THE BOAT, At this distance, the boys can't hear what is being said, but they try and size up the situation through body language. \nNECKBONE You think that's his dad? \nELLIS I don't know. \nBY THE TREELINE, \nTOM Where is she? \nMUD In town. Got here yesterday. Tom lowers his head. Frustrated. \nTOM Why you out here like this? \nBY THE BOAT, \nThe boys see Mud take a seat on a nearby stump. He's explaining something. Tom listens, standing over him. \nNECKBONE They don't look like family. Ellis watches Mud as he gestures and speaks. He seems different. Younger. Mud stops talking. Tom scratches a hand through his white crew cut. He begins pointing a finger at Mud. His face is flushed and the sound of his voice carries to the boys, though still unintelligible. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) He's really givin' it to him. \nAT THE TREELINE, Mud's head hangs as Tom shouts at him. \nTOM You've spent your whole life followin' that girl! She's run you halfway cross the country and back, and for what? For this, left out on an island beggin' for help. A murderer. A thief. \nMUD I ain't no thief. \nTOM What would you call it then? Don't even mention draggin' those boys into this. Do you have any idea what you're doin'? Waits for a response, but Mud gives none. \nTOM (CONT'D) I'm ashamed of you. Mud looks up at him. \nTOM (CONT'D) Don't expect help from me. There's none to be given. \nAT THE BOAT, They see Tom turn his back on Mud and head toward the boat. Mud doesn't protest; he doesn't move. Tom brushes past Ellis. \nTOM (CONT'D) I'm ready. Tom shoves the boat back into the water. Neckbone helps him. Ellis looks back at Mud, who still hasn't moved from his stump. He goes to him. Tom sees this and stops pushing. \nTOM (CONT'D) \n(TO HIMSELF) Dammit. \nAT THE TREELINE, Ellis stops a good six feet back from where Mud sits. \nELLIS You all right? Mud raises his head. \nMUD Looks like we're on our own. He stands and takes a folded piece of paper from his shirt. \nMUD (CONT'D) I didn't want you bein' the one to do this, but I can't see a way around it. I need to get this letter to Juniper. Could you take it to her for me? \nELLIS Yeah. \nMUD You have to be careful. You can't just walk up and knock on her door, you hear me? You have to watch yourself. \nELLIS I can handle it. Ellis steps forward and Mud hands over the note. Ellis takes it and walks back to the others. \nAT THE BOAT, Tom stares at Ellis as he climbs on board. Tom looks back at Mud, who is watching him. He gives the boat a final shove before pulling himself in. They motor away. Tom doesn't look back. \n57 EXT. RIVER/SHELLY'S OXBOW - MOVING - DAY 57 \nNECKBONE You Mud's daddy? \nTOM Mud didn't have no daddy. No mother I ever knew of. He was livin' in the woods when I met him. Younger than you are now. Tom doesn't offer anymore. Neckbone thinks on his answer. Ellis kills the engine near the mouth of Shelly's Oxbow. Tom jumps down into the knee deep river and wades onto shore. He turns back to the boys. \nTOM (CONT'D) Ya'll need to watch yourselves. Don't go gettin' into something you don't have any business in. Mud's into something you don't want any part of. I suggest you forget about him. Ellis and Neckbone don't respond. Tom, with a final admonishing look, disappears into the woods. Ellis cranks the motor and points the boat up river. \n58 EXT. RIVER - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER 58 \nEdges of the notebook paper flap in the wind. Neckbone reads Mud's letter to Juniper. Ellis reaches the bank where they stash their boat. He shuts off the motor and let's them drift. Neckbone folds the letter back up and turns to face Ellis. \nELLIS What do you think? \nEllis drops down to the deck and grabs another pulley. \nELLIS What'd you mean when you called Tom an assassin? \nMUD Tom's had lives you'd never know about. Grew up up North. Went to Yale. For a long time he was a paid killer for the C.I.A. Lived in Cuba in `63. He's probably killed more people than you've met. \n(TO NECKBONE) Hand me that line. Neckbone tosses him an end of rope, looks to Ellis. Ellis gives a shrug before heading back up the trunk. \n70 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY - LATER 70 \nMud hangs off the tree fifteen feet up by a piece of rope tied around his waist. A series of ropes and pulleys crisscross from the boat to the trees. Neckbone and Ellis stand on the ground staring up at him. Mud holds a chainsaw and seems to be hesitating. \nNECKBONE Well if you're gonna do it do it! Mud takes a deep breath and yanks the cord. Angled on one of the main branches holding up the boat, Mud begins cutting. Ellis and Neckbone step further and further back as they watch the chainsaw work through the thick limb. Suddenly, the chainsaw stops. A deep CRACKING sound. The huge branch SNAPS, tumbling off lower limbs before crashing to the ground. Mud holds onto the trunk for dear life. The branch now rests on the ground, SILENCE. The ropes and pulleys hang taught, squeaking from the weight of the boat. Mud slowly lifts his head up. He smiles at what he sees. The rigging has held. \nMUD One down! Neckbone and Ellis watch as Mud scampers around the trunk to the next branch. The chainsaw cranks back on. \nNECKBONE This shit is crazy. \n71 I/E. MARY LEE'S CAR/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - LATE 71 \nAFTERNOON Ellis looks out the car window at HIGH SCHOOL KIDS that have gathered in the Piggly Wiggly parking lot. His hair is slicked to one side, and he's wearing a collared shirt. \nMARY LEE You look nice. \nELLIS Thanks. \nMARY LEE What time are you gonna be home? Ellis shrugs. She looks at him as the car radio rambles. \nMARY LEE (CONT'D) No later than eleven? Ellis nods. \nELLIS You make up your mind? \nMARY LEE About moving in town? \nELLIS About leavin' dad. Mary Lee thinks about how to answer, shuts off the radio. \nMARY LEE You can't make other people change Ellis. If I'm unhappy then I'll have to be the one to change something. Ellis chews on the inside of his cheek and watches her avoid eye contact. He shoulders his way out of the car. Mary Lee takes a moment before driving off. As Mary Lee pulls away, Ellis takes in the scene. \n72 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN - LATE AFTERNOON - ELLIS POV 72 \nHe looks up at Juniper's motel room and sees her leaning on the railing smoking a cigarette. She doesn't see him. \n73 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS 73 \nHe pauses, noticing a MAN to his left who ALSO stares up at Juniper. The man, early thirties with a thick mustache, is JAMES. He leans against the grill of a black Lincoln. \nCarver appears from inside the Piggly Wiggly. He holds a cup of coffee and is closely trailed by a fat little man, NELSON(56). They're all dressed in a similar fashion, a cross between rural farmers and rodeo stars. As Carver approaches the Lincoln, he scolds James for leaning on the grill. Carver rubs the hood with his coat sleeve and gives orders to the men. \nMAY PEARL (O.S.) Ellis! Ellis turns to see May Pearl hopping down from a Ford Bronco. She leans on the door and waves Ellis into the back. \nMAY PEARL (CONT'D) Come on! Ellis takes another look at Carver and his men before running over to the Bronco. \n74 EXT. FIELD/BONFIRE - NIGHT 74 \nA bonfire rages in the middle of an open field. A FEW DOZEN KIDS mingle between vehicles and the fire. Drinking, yelling, music blasting from car speakers. Ellis stands by himself next to the blaze with his hands in his pockets. May Pearl has vanished. Pryor, the skinny kid Ellis punched to get this date, wanders past. He makes eye contact. Ellis stares him down. Pryor glares back but then just skulks over to another group. \nMAY PEARL (O.S.) Try this. A Styrofoam Sonic Cup is thrust into Ellis' hand. He turns to find May Pearl standing next to him. \nMAY PEARL (CONT'D) Come on. She leads Ellis behind one of the trucks parked nearby. May Pearl climbs onto the tailgate, a red glow across her face. No one else is around. Ellis hesitates. \nMAY PEARL (CONT'D) You wanna sit down? Ellis takes a seat next to her. She looks at him, smiling, and gestures to his black eye. \nMAY PEARL (CONT'D) You must really like to fight? \nELLIS Not really. Ellis takes a sip from the Sonic cup. His face puckers. \nMAY PEARL But you're not scared if you have to. \nELLIS I guess. You got a lot of friends. \nMAY PEARL They're all right. I don't know all of `em. \nELLIS I bet you're pretty popular. \nTOM He tell you why he shot that man? \nELLIS Because he hurt Juniper. \nTOM Right. The real reason Mud's in the trouble he's got is because of her. He's been in love with that girl since he was your age. They used to run all around here and it was the same back then. He'd follow that girl wherever she led him. Problem is she don't care about nobody but herself. I've told him as much. She'd bed down with the meanest snake she could find, then when things went bad she'd go runnin' to Mud. Mud would take her back, then go find whatever unlucky sonofabitch last put a hand on her and beat `em `til they knew to never touch her again. And this time I guess he thought a beating wasn't good enough. Had to shoot that fella. I don't know for sure, but I'd put money on Juniper knowin' he'd do it. And I have a suspicion she might of even told him to. Either way, those two are set for failure. Only chance Mud has is to cut her loose. Cause I'll tell you what, Mud's no bad ass. He's runnin' scared. Ellis can't look Tom in the eye, he's offended by the old man's remarks. Ellis sets the coffee cup on the desk. \nELLIS I gotta go. Ellis heads for the door, but stops short. \nELLIS (CONT'D) You're wrong about Juniper. They love each other and they're gonna make it. If you weren't a wore out old man you'd know it was true. Tom eyes the boy, taking a sip from his cup. He nods a goodbye to Ellis who is already out the door. \n78 EXT. ISLAND/BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 78 \nEllis stomps out of the trees and is struck by the new position of the boat. It hangs three feet off the ground; SUSPENDED in dry dock. A clear-cut path of trees leads off toward the island's southern shore. Beside the boat, remnants of a giant fire smolder. Ellis surveys the MOUND OF ASH. \nMUD (O.S.) What you say Ellis? Ellis turns to find Mud standing on the deck of the boat holding a fistful of wires. He jumps down. \nELLIS I got more stuff. \nMUD You find a motor? \nELLIS Not yet. (points to the ash) What's that? \nMUD I made a bonfire. Mud enters the woods. Ellis follows. \nELLIS Why? \nMUD Bonfire's an all purpose cure all for bad luck. I don't know where this boat's been or what kind of person had it before me. For all I know it could have some serious bad business left on it. We got too much ridin' on this thing to leave to chance. Where's Neckbone? \nELLIS Helpin' his uncle with a dive. \n79 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - MOMENTS LATER 79 \nMud and Ellis exit the treeline heading to Ellis' boat. \nELLIS Tom called me over to his place this mornin'. \nMUD What he say? \nELLIS He was runnin' down Juniper. Ellis looks for a response, but Mud just jumps up into the boat and starts throwing pieces of wood on shore. \nELLIS (CONT'D) I told him he was a wore out old man. Told him he couldn't know how much you loved Juniper. \nMUD You don't know his story. \nELLIS I don't care. \nMUD You should. Tom loved a woman more than most men could in two lifetimes. They had a good life started together. Mud hops down and scoops a load of wood into his arms. \nMUD (CONT'D) She was pregnant with a little boy, but the birth got the better of `em. They didn't make it. Tom's been alone ever since. Lone wolf. Mud has begun walking back to the treeline. Ellis stays. \nELLIS I gotta go help my dad. Mud turns back but doesn't stop moving. \nMUD Thanks for the wood Ellis. Ellis watches him go, thinking on what he said. \n80 EXT. UNDERWATER - RIVER - DAY 80 \nFully suited in diving gear, Galen toils in the murky brown water at the bottom of the river. His gear consists of a typical wet-suit, wet-socks but no gloves. His metal helmet is not typical. It's welded from half a hot water heater that's been fitted with barbell weights. A hose connected to the top runs to the surface. Galen ties off a netted sack and yanks on its line. \n81 EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS 81 \nA small air compressor chugs as Neckbone stands in the middle of Galen's boat pulling in the heavy rope. At the end, the net bulging with mussel shells appears. He manages to roll the heavy load into the boat before moving over to a crank handle that feeds another line. After several cranks, Galen's steel helmet breaches the surface. He places his hands on the edge of the boat as Neckbone removes the barbell weights. The weight removed, Neckbone takes off the helmet. Galen pulls himself into the boat, out of breath. \nGALEN This shit never gets easy. \nNECKBONE That's a good haul. \nGALEN I've had worse. Galen reclines as Neckbone kills the air compressor and begins organizing the gear. He watches his little nephew. \nGALEN (CONT'D) You doin' all right? \nNECKBONE Yeah. \nGALEN You don't need to tell me anything? \nCARVER (CONT'D) This is my father, King. He runs the show. Carver recedes as King steps forward. He speaks like a high school football coach. \nKING Men. I wanna thank you for the work you're doin'. It's important work, and I want you to know what it means to me personally. I'm grateful for it. No man should have to bury his son. It's not natural, and it's a pain I hope none of you ever have to endure. King removes a photocopied picture of Mud from his pocket. He unfolds it, stares at it, then raises it to the men. \nKING (CONT'D) This man did that to me. He took my youngest boy. And now, you're gonna help me get him. King stares at the men, keeping the photo held high. \nKING (CONT'D) Now gather `round. Come on now, in a circle. I want ya'll to join hands. They do it reluctantly. \nKING (CONT'D) Everybody take a knee. They do. King joins them on his knee and grabs Carver and another Man's hands. \nKING (CONT'D) Bow your heads. I need you to help me pray for the death of the man that killed my son. They all bow their heads. \nA85 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - MORNING A85 \nA tarp is thrown back from a rusting boat trailer. Ellis and Neckbone stand by the trailer looking less than thrilled. It's covered in junk and debris. \nNECKBONE You touch her breast? \nELLIS A little. \nNECKBONE That's great man. \nELLIS Thanks. Ellis walks up and knocks a stack of bricks off the trailer. \nELLIS (CONT'D) We could take it apart. Bring it out piece by piece. \nNECKBONE It's welded. We'd just tear it up. What if we float it out? \nELLIS With what? \nNECKBONE Come on. Neckbone walks to the trailer. Ellis follows. \nB85 INT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS B85 \nThe boys open the front door and are met by a BLINDING LIGHT. \nNECKBONE Jesus! They squint and shield their eyes. The light shuts off as quickly as it came on. Galen stands in front of them wearing his wet suit. The bar with the flood lights attached sits across his shoulders. The boys rub their eyeballs, seeing spots. Galen shuffles over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the lights. He labors to take a seat. \nGALEN What do you think? \n79A. \nNECKBONE That's real good Galen. \n(TO ELLIS) Gimme a minute. Neckbone, still blinking, goes back to his room. Ellis notices Galen staring at him. Galen pats the couch. \nGALEN Come `ere Ellis. Ellis takes a seat on the other end of the couch. Galen pats the spot next to him. Ellis scoots over, uncomfortable. \nGALEN (CONT'D) \n(POINTING UP) You see that ceiling fan? \nELLIS Yeah. \nGALEN I found it in the river. Works great. Best ceiling fan I've ever owned. This river brings a lotta trash down it. Some a that trash is worth a lotta money, some of it's not. You gotta know what's worth keepin' and what's worth lettin' go. You know the difference? \nELLIS I think so. \nGALEN Neck looks up to you. Don't get my nephew into anything you can't get him out of. Galen forces a stare with Ellis, who nods. Neckbone enters as Galen begins to remove his light rig. \nGALEN (CONT'D) Help Me Rhonda's just about a guy needing to get a piece to get over a girl that put one over on him. So you get your heart broke, don't walk around with a shit look on your face. Get back in there. Get your tip wet. You hear me? \nELLIS What? \nGALEN You know what I'm sayin'. \n79B. \nEllis doesn't. Galen moves to an electric guitar leaning by a small amp in the corner. \nGALEN (CONT'D) Ya'll wanna hang out? Alan's comin' over. We're gonna pump it up. \nNECKBONE We got stuff to do. \nJUNIPER Wait. Just wait. I don't know about alla this. I don't even know what he thinks we're gonna do. Where are we even gonna go? This is Mud. This is what Mud does. Ellis hears her crying through the phone. \nELLIS It's okay. He's got the boat. We helped him fix it up. It's a good plan. Just be ready. \nJUNIPER Why are you even doing this? \nELLIS What do you mean? \nJUNIPER Why are you helping us? \nELLIS Cause ya'll love each other. Juniper searches for a comment. Ellis, looking out over the parking lot, sees May Pearl getting out of a car with her MOTHER and SISTER. \nELLIS (CONT'D) I'll see you tomorrow. \nJUNIPER Wait. Dial Tone. Juniper holds the phone, worried. \n89 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 89 \nEllis turns and watches May Pearl push a cart in the parking lot with her family. Neckbone bangs at the Coke machine. \nNECKBONE How'd it go? \nELLIS We're good. \n90 I/E. CARVER'S LINCOLN/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - DAY 90 Carver sits behind the wheel of his Lincoln. The man with the mustache, James, sits in the passenger seat next to him. Carver notices Ellis and Neckbone standing in front of the Piggly Wiggly. He climbs out. \nAT THE VENDING MACHINES, \nNECKBONE Gimme a quarter. This shit took mine. Ellis watches May Pearl entering the grocery store. He calls out with a wave. \nELLIS \nMAY PEARL! Without stopping, May Pearl, along with her Sister and Mother, all turn. May Pearl sees him, but doesn't wave back. She continues inside. Ellis looks confused, then embarrassed. Neckbone notices. \nNECKBONE It's all right man. She's with her family. Come on. I wanna get that motor before dark. They head to the dirt bike. \nCARVER (O.S.) Hey there! Ellis turns to see Carver approaching. \nCARVER (CONT'D) You remember me don't you? Ellis nods. Carver notes the healing bruise on Ellis' face. \nCARVER (CONT'D) I'm sure sorry about that. Ya'll caught me at a real bad time. \nEllis climbs on the bike. Carver walks over to them. \nCARVER (CONT'D) Hold on now. One second. I don't want ya'll thinkin' I'm a bad guy. Ya'll were just trying to do a job, and I got in your way. Carver removes a roll of twenties and peels off two. \nCARVER (CONT'D) Let's just say I bought that whole batch of fish ya'll were sellin'. Would forty cover it? \nNECKBONE That'd bout do it. \nELLIS We don't want your money. Carver steps in close to the boys. \nCARVER I bet ya'll really get around this town. Probably know every hole and ditch. Have ya'll come across the man whose picture I showed you? \nELLIS No. Carver removes a flier with Mud's picture and holds it out. \nCARVER You sure about that? Take a look with your good eye. \nELLIS I'm sure. \nCARVER What about that girl in the motel? The pretty one. Ya'll talk to her some more? \nELLIS No. Carver smiles. He tucks the flier and the forty dollars into Ellis' hand. \nCARVER There's a number on there. Ya'll let me know if you do. \nNeckbone cranks the engine and backs the bike up with his feet. They pull away. Moving, Ellis looks back to see Carver watching them. \n91 EXT. CRAWFORD'S JUNKYARD - DUSK 91 \nNeckbone pulls back a loose section of chain-link fence surrounding the marine junkyard. Ellis crouches through. \nINSIDE THE JUNKYARD, Ellis and Neckbone creep through piles of starboard and boat parts. They stop at a party barge with only one pontoon. At its rear hangs a big rusted motor, 200 horsepower. Neckbone quickly disassembles its attachment. The motor pops loose leaving the boys to strain against its heavy weight. They ease it to the ground. \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) \nI SAID GET OUTTA HERE!!! Neckbone gathers his friend and leads him away. \nNECKBONE Thanks a lot asshole! \n(TO ELLIS) Come on man. They head over to Neckbone's dirt bike. He pulls out the key and climbs on. Ellis hesitates. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) I'll take you home. \nELLIS We're gonna have to tell Mud. Neckbone drops his head, nods reluctantly. \n100 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 100 \nThe boys struggle to pull the heavy motor out of their boat. It hits the shoreline with a thud. They lean over it, sucking air. \nELLIS Just leave it. Mud'll have to help get it. \nNECKBONE What're you gonna tell him? \nELLIS I'll just tell him the truth. \n101 EXT. ISLAND/SOUTHERN SHORE - NIGHT 101 \nMud stands at the back of the boat, which now rests on the boat trailer near the water. His face is clean shaven and his hair is wetted back. His shirt, still filthy, is tucked into his pants. He whistles and works by the light of a small fire nearby. Ellis steps out from behind a tree. He's holding the grocery sack that was left on his houseboat. \nELLIS \nMUD! Mud, hearing the voice, quickly puts down his tools and turns to the woods. He smooths his clothes down. \nMUD What you say there?! Ellis appears out of the dark, followed by Neckbone. Mud's eyes search the treeline for Juniper. \nMUD (CONT'D) What you say Ellis? Ellis can't look him in the eye. \nELLIS We got that motor. \nMUD Is Juniper okay? \nELLIS Yeah. \nMUD Where is she? \nELLIS She didn't meet up with us. \nMUD What happened? Was it Carver? \nELLIS It wasn't Carver. Mud straightens up, prepares for the news. \nMUD What's goin' on Ellis? \nELLIS She was supposed to meet us on the side of the motel. She never showed up. We went asking for her. The motel clerk told us she went to a bar out on 61. \nMUD What? \nELLIS We tracked her down. She was there with another guy. \n(HESITATES) They were together. Mud's face drops. He walks to the fire and shakes a cooking pot resting in the coals. The pot bubbles with roof tar. \nMUD She probably thought Carver was on to her. \nELLIS She knew the plan Mud. She just didn't show up. \nMUD What was she doin' with the other guy? Ellis hesitates, not wanting to say. Mud pushes. \nMUD (CONT'D) What were they doin' Ellis? \nELLIS They were playin' pool. Drinkin'. He was close up on her. They were laughin'. He kissed her on the neck. Mud nods. \nMUD And that's how it is. He takes the pot of roofing tar over to the boat and begins pasting some of the newly replaced boards with a flat stick. \nELLIS What do you want us to do? \nMUD Just go home Ellis. Ellis looks at Neckbone, then sets the grocery sack on the ground. \nMARY LEE (CONT'D) Ellis. You'll return that motor from where you found it and you'll apologize in person to the man you took it from. I won't hear about anything like this again. Mary Lee walks to the front door. She collects her purse and keys and exits quietly. Senior and Ellis stand in silence, which feels even more uncomfortable than the shouting. Ellis finally speaks. \nELLIS I can't take that motor back. But I'll pay him for it. I'll pay him what he wants for it. Senior, stoic, pivots his body away from the boy. \nSENIOR I don't care what you do Ellis. Senior retreats to the bedroom. Ellis is left alone in the wake. He looks to his room. The door opens slightly and Neckbone takes a step out. Neckbone doesn't say anything. He just bites at his lip, sympathy for his friend. \n105 EXT. ISLAND SHORE LANDING - DAY 105 \nCharred hunks of driftwood smolder in a ruined pile on the sand. They constitute the remains of a large bonfire. Neckbone and Ellis stare at the ash. \nNECKBONE What the hell's all this? \nELLIS It's a bonfire. \nNECKBONE I guess he didn't care about bein' seen. Ellis kicks at one of the burned logs. He bends down and finds the bottle of Jack Daniels, smashed. \nELLIS He had something else on his mind. Come on. Ellis leads Neckbone into the treeline. \n106 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - DAY 106 \nMud's yellow shirt hangs, partially ripped, from a tree branch. Ellis pulls it off the limb. Concerned, they head deeper into the woods, over the fallen tree trunk that bridges the creek. \n107 EXT. ISLAND WOODS AND SOUTHERN SHORE - DAY 107 \nThe boys watch Mud through the trees at a distance. He's crouched on the deck of the boat fiddling with wiring. Mud, giving no sign he sees the boys, yells out to them. \nMUD What are ya'll hidin' for? Mud drops the wiring and scales down to the bank. They emerge from the woods. Ellis carries the yellow shirt. \nELLIS We found your shirt. Ellis tosses it to him. Mud tosses it back. \nMUD Keep it. I don't need it anymore. Mud goes to the motor at the rear to tinker with more wires. \nELLIS We saw what's left of your bonfire. \n(NO RESPONSE) Somebody could've seen you. \nMUD I guess. \nELLIS You do some drinkin' last night? \nMUD I did a lot of drinkin' last night. Mud stops and walks over to address the boys. His face is pale and his manner is curt. \nMUD (CONT'D) Neck I'm gonna need you here to get the motor runnin'. Ellis I need you to do something else for me. Mud removes a folded note from his back pocket. \nMUD (CONT'D) I need you to take this to Juniper. \nELLIS Okay Mud. Ellis takes the letter. Mud goes back to the boat motor. He motions to Neckbone to join him. \nMUD Let's go. \nELLIS You still takin' Juniper? \nMUD I had a dream last night. I saw Juniper laying in a field with another man. They were making love. I walked out into the field. Walked toward `em. I was so angry the tips of my ears were burnin'. That's how I knew I was gonna kill this man. But when I got up close enough, I saw that the man she was with had tattoos on his back, just like mine. I moved in closer and the guy turns his head back toward me. Hair for hair, dead truth, the guy she was with was me. Mud ducks back under the motor. Ellis looks at Neckbone, worried. \nMUD (CONT'D) I'll finish the boat, but I'd be surprised if I live long enough to sail on it. A vision of yourself is a sure sign of death. Neck can you grab me a socket wrench? Neckbone and Ellis walk to the toolbox sitting nearby. They crouch by it, speaking quietly. \nNECKBONE You be all right? \nELLIS Yeah. What about you? \nNECKBONE He'll be okay. \nELLIS Can I borrow your bike? Neckbone fishes the key out of his pocket. Hesitates. \nNECKBONE Don't tump it. Ellis nods. Neckbone walks over to Mud with the toolbox. Letter in hand, Ellis gives a final look toward Mud's labor and walks back into the woods. On his way, he stops to hang Mud's shirt on a tree branch. \n108 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY 108 \nEllis rides in the flat bottom boat alone. He stares at the letter in his hand. \n109 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY - DAY 109 \nEllis sits on the dirt bike. He scans the parking lot. No black Lincoln. His eyes stop on a green pick-up. Miller, sits inside. Ellis looks around and finds a pay phone nearby. He gets off the bike and walks toward it. Ellis removes the flier Carver gave him. He dials a phone number copied at the bottom. \nKYLE Get your head outta my car kid. Ellis takes his right elbow and quickly knocks Kyle in the mouth. It splits his upper lip. Kyle grabs his face. \nKYLE (CONT'D) Shit! \nMAY PEARL Ellis! \nELLIS I called you twice yesterday. Your sister didn't tell you? Kyle slings the door open knocking Ellis to the pavement. From the ground, Ellis can see that Kyle is big and considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before. Kyle's friends from other cars take notice and begin to converge on them. Ellis makes a move for Kyle's legs but is kicked back to the pavement. Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him. Another punch to Ellis' face. May Pearl is out of the car and yelling. \nMAY PEARL Kyle! Stop it Kyle! \nMay Pearl pulls Kyle by the collar. By his own will, he raises off of Ellis, keeping an eye on him. A streak of blood stretches from Ellis' nose to his ear. He gets to his feet, dazed. Ellis wipes at his nose and sees May Pearl shove Kyle. Kyle smiles and turns to his friends, who laugh. The CROWD that has collected consists of older high school guys and girls. Ellis steps toward May Pearl and is met with a shove too. \nMAY PEARL (CONT'D) What the hell are you doin' here Ellis?! \nELLIS What? \nMAY PEARL You can't just run up and punch people I'm with! \nELLIS I'm sorry, I just wanted to know why you hadn't called me back. \nI... \nMAY PEARL Why would I call you back Ellis? \nELLIS Because you're my girlfriend. The crowd is watching. \nMAY PEARL I'm not your girlfriend! We went on one date. One! \nELLIS We kissed. \nMAY PEARL That doesn't matter! \nELLIS Yeah but... \nMAY PEARL But what Ellis?! What did you expect?! \nELLIS I love you. \nMAY PEARL You're fourteen! \nELLIS Don't. Wait. We can make this work. We can figure it out. I love you. \nMAY PEARL What? Ellis is losing it. His eyes are red. He looks at the crowd of kids. There are smiles and some snickering. May Pearl is speechless. She just stares at him. Ellis turns and walks back to the dirt bike. May Pearl's girlfriends gather around her. She shakes her head, dumbstruck. Ellis lifts the bike off the ground. He looks back at May Pearl who appears to be shrugging off the whole affair in front of her friends. Ellis speeds off. \n114 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/RIVERBANK - DAY 114 \nA fire snaps and pops on the riverbank next to Ellis' houseboat. Ellis drags a piece of particle board from a trash pile nearby. He drops the board onto the fire and stands back to watch the blaze. Neckbone's bike leans on a tree behind him. Senior's truck rattles to a stop in the gravel just down the bank. He jumps out of the cab exasperated by the fire his son has started by their home. \nSENIOR What the hell are you doin'?! Ellis says nothing. He doesn't move. Senior, continuing to yell, runs and drags a hose up from the houseboat. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) Ellis dammit! What the hell's wrong with you?! The fire hisses as Senior turns the hose on it. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) Ellis? Look at me. Ellis finally looks up at his father. A phone RINGS from inside the houseboat. Senior holds the hose in front of him. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) Take it. Put this damn thing out. \nEllis takes the hose as Senior stomps on board to catch the phone. Ellis drops the hose. Senior's voice, speaking into the telephone, faintly carries outside. He's yelling. Ellis turns his head to listen. \nSENIOR (O.S.) (CONT'D) I don't give a shit! Fine! I don't care what you do! I'm done with it! Ellis moves around the fire so he can see the houseboat through the flames. He hears the phone SLAM down. Senior appears at the back door. He stares at Ellis through the fire. Ellis moves to the side but realizes Senior isn't staring at him. He's staring at the fire. Senior disappears back into the house. There is a commotion. Ellis watches as Senior bursts out of the house holding an armful of woman's clothes. Senior walks up to the bonfire and begins tossing clothes on top piece by piece. \nELLIS What are you doing? Ellis watches as dresses and blouses begin to shrivel up in the flames. \nELLIS (CONT'D) Stop it! That's mom's stuff! STOP \nIT! Ellis shoves at Senior. He easily counters the boy with his arm and continues tossing the clothes into the fire. Ellis is screaming and crying. \nELLIS (CONT'D) \nSTOP IT! STOP! Ellis tries yanking the remaining clothes out of his father's hands but Senior shakes him off. Ellis stumbles. He watches with tears as Senior tosses all of the clothes on. Senior watches his wife's clothes burn. Ellis backs away to the bike. He climbs on, cranks the engine and speeds off. \n115 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 115 \nEllis grounds the flat-bottom on shore and jumps out. \nMUD Shit. He rips the jeans up to the thigh. Mud tears a section of cloth from the bottom of his own shirt and creates a tourniquet just below Ellis' knee. \nMUD (CONT'D) What time is it? Mud pulls a black Sharpie out of his pocket. Neckbone doesn't answer, just stares. \nMUD (CONT'D) \nWHAT TIME IS IT?! \nNeckbone checks his watch. \nNECKBONE It's four eighteen! Mud draws a line on Ellis' leg just above the swollen bite. He writes, \"418\". \nMUD Yell out every 10 minutes! Mud elevates Ellis' leg then gently cups his head. He dabs the gash on Ellis' forehead. \nNECKBONE Is he gonna be okay?! \nMUD We just need to get him to a clinic! Is there still one in town?! \nNECKBONE Yeah! \nMUD It's the closest?! \nNECKBONE Yeah! \nMUD I'm gonna need your bike! \nNECKBONE Are you bit?! Mud shakes his head. \nMUD No. He holds Ellis as they move steadily up river. \n122 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY 122 \nThe flat bottom boat approaches the riverbank. Neckbone points to the sandy ridge and yells up to Mud. \nNECKBONE My bike should be just over that ridge! Mud looks at Ellis' leg. The swelling has crept up his thigh. Black lines with numbers mark its progress: \"428, 438, 448\". Ellis' face has taken on a blue tint. \nThe boat hasn't reached the shore, but Mud takes Ellis in his arms and jumps into the water. He wades onto the bank. \n123 AT THE BIKE, 123 Mud straddles it, turning Ellis' body so they are face to face. He cranks the bike and speeds away. Neckbone makes it to the top of the ridge in time to see Mud disappear into the trees. \n124 EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY 124 \nMud speeds the dirt bike down the two-lane highway. He's far too big for the bike and it's even trickier balancing Ellis. Coming up on a slow moving pick-up overloaded with junk, Mud veers into the opposing lane. \nONCOMING TRAFFIC. Mud darts back to his lane in time to miss a semi. \n125 EXT. CLINIC - DAY 125 \nA MALE NURSE(36) wheels an ELDERLY MAN through the sliding double front doors of a small clinic. Mud appears around the corner. The bike speeding toward the entrance. In a fluid motion, Mud takes Ellis in his arms and lifts his leg over the bike. The bike tilts and slides across the pavement, smacking solidly into the curb. Mud has managed to stay on his feet with the boy in his arms and rushes through the automatic front doors. \n126 INT. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS 126 \nThe reception area has a DOZEN PATIENTS sitting in it. A check-in desk to the left. Mud holds Ellis out in his arms. \nMUD \nI NEED HELP HERE! A FEMALE NURSE rushes out of the check-in area. \nFEMALE NURSE Just stay calm. What's going on? \nMUD He's been snake bit. ANOTHER NURSE rushes off calling for a doctor. The room becomes more frenzied. Patients talking. Nurses shouting. \nMUD (CONT'D) He's snake bit. A cotton mouth. On his calf. Just under an hour. As quickly as Mud gets this out, a GROUP of NURSES rush out of a door at the end of the room pushing a gurney. They take Ellis from Mud's arm, place him on the gurney, and speed him into the back of the clinic. The commotion gone, the reception area feels oddly still. Mud takes a deep breath. He looks to his right. Patients stare at him. He's beyond disheveled. He's crazy looking. Mud turns to his left. The Male Nurse stares at him. For the first time, Mud realizes he's out in the open. \nMALE NURSE Sir? Mud slowly backs up. \nMALE NURSE (CONT'D) Sir? We're gonna need some information? Mud backs out of the automatic doors. The entire room stares at him. \n127 EXT. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS 127 \nMud is outside. The glass doors close. He nervously checks over his shoulders. He spots a bank of trees just down from the clinic. He heads for them. The front doors slide open and the Male Nurse walks out. \nMALE NURSE Sir?! Mud hops into the bank of trees and disappears. \nNECKBONE It ain't sunk yet. Mud smiles. He holds out his hand, which Neckbone slaps. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) I wish Ellis could see it. \nMUD I know. Mud walks back on shore and collects his duffel bag. \nMUD (CONT'D) I owe you your end of the deal. Mud removes the pistol from the back of his jeans. Neckbone's eyes light up. Mud hands it over and Neckbone immediately notices a hole where the clip is missing. \nNECKBONE Where the bullets? \nMUD The deal was for the gun, not the bullets. \nNECKBONE Shit. Neckbone begrudgingly crams the pistol into the back of his pants. \nMUD I got one last favor to ask you. Neckbone sucks his teeth. \n134 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 134 \nWater gently laps at the side of Ellis' houseboat. The bayou is quiet. From the darkness, Neckbone and Mud appear in the flat-bottom boat. They paddle with their hands. Approaching in silence. \n135 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT 135 \nEllis stares at the ceiling, unable to sleep. A TAP comes from the window. Ellis sits up in bed. Mud pokes his head in. He whispers. \nMUD Ellis? \nELLIS Mud? \nMUD Yeah. Mud pulls his body through the window. It's tight but he manages to make it look somewhat graceful. Mud takes a quick survey of the dark room. Ellis begins to get out of bed. \nMUD (CONT'D) No, don't get up. Mud motions him back down and pulls the chair from the desk over to the bed. They speak in hushed voices. \nELLIS How'd you get here? \nMUD Neck brought me. \n136 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 136 \nNeckbone sits in the flat-bottom tied off at the corner. \nFROM THE TREELINE ON SHORE, All EIGHT of the Bounty Hunters sit hunkered in the trees. Carver squats next to a stump. He loads shotgun shells into a 12 gauge pump and motions for the others to fan out along the bank. \n137 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 137 \nMUD We got the boat in the water. \nELLIS You did? \nMUD Just now. Smooth sailin' from here on out. \nELLIS Good. \nMUD Wish you coulda seen it. \nELLIS Me too. \nMUD Didn't feel right leavin' town without sayin' goodbye. There is an awkward moment. \nELLIS I'm sorry `bout what I said. \nMUD No. No. You were right to be mad. You were right about a lot of things. I'm the one that's sorry. I shoulda never gotten ya'll into all this. I just didn't see any other way around it. But I couldn't leave without you knowin' I never lied about being your friend. I never lied about that. \nELLIS I know. \nMUD I don't traffic in the truth too often. But I did love her. I do love her. \nELLIS She loves you too. She said it. This fact still strikes Mud. He nods. \nMUD I just made mistakes. We both did. This is a hard life to keep up with. You can't blame her for gettin' tired of tryin'. \nELLIS My dad says you can't count on women lovin' you. He says you can't trust it. \nMUD That's not true. Don't judge your life on all of our mistakes. You'll make plenty mistakes of your own, no need takin' on everybody else's. You're a good man Ellis. If you find a girl half as good, you'll be all right. \n", "test1_input": "MUD What state troopers? \nNECKBONE The ones spreadin' your picture all over the place. Stoppin' cars on 165 searchin' for your ass. Mud factors this in and then goes back to writing. \nMUD I didn't know about that, but it doesn't surprise me. There plenty of folks lookin' for me right now. \nELLIS Why? \nMUD I shot a man. Killed him. \nMud stands and walks to the back of the boat. The boys' eyes follow him cautiously. Mud lifts a hatch at the back that would typically house the batteries and engine wiring. There's nothing left but a hole into the trees. He makes a note. \nMUD (CONT'D) I'm sorry I didn't tell ya'll sooner, but I was hopin' to be gone before anything came of it. Didn't want you involved. Mud turns to really face them for the first time. \nMUD (CONT'D) Ya'll have been real good to me. You're the only friends I got out here. If the state troopers have 165 blocked, they'll have others blocked too. I won't get anywhere in a car. I want to try takin' this boat down, see if we can get it in the water. Ellis and Neckbone stand their ground. They don't say anything. Mud walks back to the steering column. He drops to his knees and fiddles with the wires. \nMUD (CONT'D) With a boat like this I can make it to the gulf in two days. I could get anywhere from there. But I'd need a boat at least this big to make it on open water. It's got no title, no owner, nobody lookin' for it. It's my best shot. \nNECKBONE Who'd you kill? \nMUD It was a bad piece of business. Ya'll don't need to hear about it. \nELLIS I need to hear about it. Mud sits up. He looks at Ellis, deciding how much to tell. \nMUD Juniper made a mistake. She hooked up with a guy. He was no good. His name was Hutchins. Family owns a chain of restaurants down in Texas. \nELLIS Where were you? \nMUD I was around, but me and Juniper were on the outs. She met this Hutchins, he sold her on some lies. Got her pregnant. That's when he started showin' who he really was. He dropped June down a flight of stairs after whoopin' her half to death. She lost the baby. He made it so the doctors think she can't have children anymore. There're things you can get away with in this world and things you can't. I tracked him down at a motel just outside of San Antonio. He was there with another woman. That's where it happened. Mud's done with his story. He goes back to the wiring. \nMUD (CONT'D) I understand if you can't help me anymore, but I need this boat. And I need to get it in the water fast. After a moment, he sits up and wipes sweat from his forehead. \nMUD (CONT'D) I've made a list. Things we'll need. What do ya'll think? Ellis takes time to consider everything. He looks at Neckbone, who has a disgruntled look on his face. \nELLIS You did it for her? To protect her? \nMUD Yeah. Ellis nods. Mud looks over at Neckbone, who still has the disgruntled look on his face. \nMUD (CONT'D) What do you think? \nNECKBONE I think you want us to run around, stickin' our necks out, gettin' everything you need, just so you can take our boat. \nMUD That's about it. Mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter. \nNECKBONE What do we get out of it? \nMUD What do you want? Neckbone looks to Ellis, judging his bargaining position. \nNECKBONE What about that pistol? Mud eyes the boy, pulling on the nub of cigarette. \nMUD I only got two things out here worth anything. This shirt... Mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans. Neckbone tenses, but relaxes when Mud splays it out on an open palm. \nMUD (CONT'D) And this pistol. I can't give you the shirt `cause I need it for protection, but if you help me get this boat in the water, the pistol's yours. Neckbone squinches his face in thought, sizing up this trade. \nNECKBONE What kind is it? \nMUD A forty five. \nNECKBONE I guess we could work a deal like that. Neckbone steps forward to grab the pistol, but Mud puts it back in his jeans. \nMUD We get this thing floatin' first. Neckbone looks over at Ellis, who shrugs. \nNECKBONE All right then. \nMud smiles, flashing his missing tooth. He spits in his palm and holds it out to Neckbone. Neckbone, not sure about taking the spit hand, reluctantly shakes. Mud rips a page from the notebook and hands it to Ellis. \nMUD Ya'll scrounge what you can off this list, but if we're gonna get this done right we'll need more help. Can you fetch Tom for me? \nELLIS Tom Blankenship? Mud has smoked down to the filter. He crushes the butt into his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket. \nMUD I was hopin' to let that old assassin stay put, but we'll need him to get things ya'll can't. Can you find him? \nELLIS I know where he lives, but I've never spoke to him. \n", "test1_true": "MUD (CONT'D) Boys? \n(THEY PAUSE) Thanks. Ellis nods. \nNECKBONE Don't lose my pistol. They continue down the rope. Mud continues his work. \n53 EXT. SHELLY'S OXBOW - DAY 53 \nEllis steers to the southern mouth of Shelly's Oxbow, the bend in the river that holds he and Tom Blankenship's houseboats, among others. He grounds the boat just shy of entering the Oxbow and steps over Neckbone to hop onto the bank. \nELLIS You comin'? \nNECKBONE I'll watch the boat. Ellis scans the woods that populate the patch of land wedged between the river and this short tributary. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) Ellis? \nELLIS What? \nNECKBONE Be careful. Galen always said that old man's crazy. Neckbone keeps his seat as Ellis darts into the woods \n54 EXT. TOM'S WOODS - DAY 54 \nEllis prowls around the small pine trees and bushes. He pauses, seeing the entrance to Tom Blankenship's boat. Something moves on the houseboat. Ellis hunkers down behind a bush. He sees Tom wrapping cable onto a metal spool. Ellis is nervous. He checks over his shoulder, nothing but woods. When he looks back to the boat, Tom is gone. In a crouch, Ellis moves closer. Taking a deep breath, Ellis steps out from the cover of the pine trees and heads up a walkway that leads onboard. \nTOM (O.S.) Why you huntin' me? Ellis flinches. He turns to find Tom Blankenship standing at the edge of the boat. \nTOM (CONT'D) You deaf boy? I said why're you huntin' me? \nELLIS I ain't huntin you. \nTOM What's your business here? \nELLIS I came to find you. I got a message for you. \nTOM You're Senior's boy. \nELLIS Yessir. \nTOM What you got to say he can't tell me himself? Tom, rusty on pleasantries, brushes past Ellis as he heads inside the boat. \nELLIS It ain't from him. Ellis, not wanting to follow further, shouts from the planks. \nELLIS (CONT'D) \nMUD SENT ME! There is a silence. Then footsteps. Tom reappears. \nTOM Mud sent you. \nELLIS Yessir. \nTOM What do you know about it? \nELLIS He asked me to come get you. Tom straightens his back. He looks into the woods, searching for something he may have missed. \nTOM Your daddy know this? \nELLIS No sir. Mud needs your help. Tom's mind churns on a series of facts unknown to the boy. \nTOM Where is he? \n55 EXT. RIVER - DAY 55 \nNeckbone bounces in the boat as it shifts in the choppy Mississippi water. His eyes are locked on the back of Tom's head. Tom rides stone faced in the front. Neckbone turns back to Ellis and raises his eyebrows as if to ask, \"What's going on?\". Ellis shrugs. \n56 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 56 \nEllis runs the boat on shore. Tom splashes into the ankle deep water and helps the boys drag it onto the bank. Ellis takes the lead, walking ahead and scanning the treeline. Mud steps out, just past the shadow of the woods. Ellis turns to Tom and points. \nELLIS There he is. Tom spits onto the muddy bank and makes his way toward Mud. Ellis and Neckbone stay by the boat and watch. \nBY THE TREELINE, Mud watches Tom approaching. He corrects his posture and feebly attempts to smooth some wrinkles from his shirt. Tom stops in front of him, his eyes pinched in the sun. \nTOM Mud. \n", "test1_id": 444, "test2_input": "JUNIPER (CONT'D) I'm so sorry. Tears form and run down her cheeks. \nJUNIPER (CONT'D) Here. She takes his hand and places it against the towel. She gets to her feet and pulls a pocket book from a bag in the corner. \nJUNIPER (CONT'D) How much is your fish? I'll buy the cooler full. Ellis motions Neckbone to the cooler. Neckbone goes over and crams his hand into the ice. He removes a Ziplock bag containing the note that Mud sent. Neckbone hands it to Ellis. Taking the note, he sets his ice down and walks over to Juniper. \nELLIS Mud sent us to give this to you. Juniper is stunned. She looks at the bag, then at the boys. \nJUNIPER You've met Mud? Ellis nods. Neckbone speaks up from the back. \nNECKBONE Yeah we met him. Juniper takes the bag. She removes the letter and takes a seat on the edge of the bed to read it. Ellis watches her eyes move along the paper. She smiles, which makes Ellis smile. After a moment, she folds it up. \nJUNIPER He tells me to hold tight. \nNECKBONE Yeah, we read it. Juniper raises her eyebrows at Neckbone. \nJUNIPER Well do you know how long `hold tight' is? \nELLIS I think it's a couple days. He wants to get a boat for ya'll. \nJUNIPER God. Juniper shakes her head and goes to the sink. She pulls a lighter from her jeans pocket and torches Mud's note. \nJUNIPER (CONT'D) Tell him I'll wait. Running water over the ashes, she turns back to them. \nJUNIPER (CONT'D) But I don't want ya'll involved. Tell him what I said and make that it. I don't want you gettin' in any trouble. \nELLIS We won't. \nJUNIPER What do you call that? She motions to his swelling eye. Ellis shrugs. \nELLIS We'll be all right. Keep your door locked. We'll be in touch. Ellis heads to the door as Neckbone gathers up the cooler. \nJUNIPER Wait. Ellis turns back. \nJUNIPER (CONT'D) What's your name? \nELLIS I'm Ellis. That's Neckbone. \nJuniper walks up to Ellis and puts her hands on his shoulders. She has to bend slightly to do it, but she kisses him just above his swollen eye. \nJUNIPER Thank you Ellis. Ellis stares at her, infatuated. \nNECKBONE We gotta go. Ellis turns and grabs one end of the cooler. Neckbone slaps back the security latch and opens the door with his free hand. They walk out. \n63 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DUSK 63 \nEllis, his foot on the door, looks back at Juniper. \nELLIS Lock the door. She smiles. The door slams shut. The room number, 212, stares Ellis in the face. He takes a deep breath. \nNECKBONE Let's go hard on. He and Ellis wrangle the cooler down the steps. The sun set while they were inside. A blue hue hangs over everything. \n64 I/E. CARVER'S LINCOLN/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 64 Carver takes a drag off a cigarette from behind the steering wheel of his black Lincoln town car, conscious to blow any smoke out the open driver's window. His car, wedged between two others in the Piggly Wiggly parking lot, is pointed toward the Executive Inn. He watches as Ellis and Neckbone load the cooler onto Neckbone's bike. \n65 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 65 \nEllis enters his houseboat. It's quiet. He sees a note on the counter next to a can of soup. It reads, \"I've gone to a movie. Warm up some soup for dinner. Love, Mom\". Ellis picks up the can, not thrilled. He goes to the fridge and grabs a sack of peas from the freezer. Holding the peas against his eye he takes a seat at the counter and flips through a phone book. He finds what he needs and dials a corded phone. He waits. \nELLIS Hello? Is May Pearl there?...This is Ellis...Hey, it's Ellis. Hey... What?...In the phone book... from his car commercials...I think they're all right...Tomorrow? Yeah, I can meet you... Okay. Bye. Ellis hangs up the phone. With the peas pressed firmly against his face, he smirks. \nCUT TO: \n66 SERIES OF IMAGES: 66 -Neckbone's sneaker busts through a rotten plank of wood. -Inside a decrepit wooden shack, Ellis gives Neckbone a look like he's a dumbass as they proceed to take the shack apart board by board. Ellis now has a full-on BLACK EYE. A66 -Neckbone stands lookout under the carport section of Ellis' A66 houseboat. The coast clear, he gives Ellis a nod. Ellis pops open a metal locker and removes a small chainsaw and container of gas. He loads these into an empty fish cooler. B66 -Tom, sitting atop his houseboat with his pellet gun, watchesB66 as the two boys sneak the tools away. He's displeased. C66 -At Neckbone's mobile home park, Ellis heaves loops of thick C66 rope onto their mini dirt bike trailer. Neckbone stands nearby laughing with the rope's OWNER, a lanky guy with brown teeth and a Tasmanian Devil tattoo on his neck. AC66 -Ellis hoists Neckbone up by the foot allowing him to AC66 unscrew a road sign. D66 -A mop soaked in black tar slops across the flat roof of the D66 furniture store in downtown Dewitt. Neckbone and Ellis stand in the store's parking lot yelling up to the ROOFERS. -They get one's attention, and Neckbone points to a dried pile of leftover tar that has been dumped at the back of the building. The ROOFER swats a hand at the boys. They proceed to load the dried hunk onto the small trailer. E66 -From a distance, Neckbone and Ellis stand on a sailboat in E66 the middle of a fenced-in marine junkyard. Surrounded by old boat parts, the boys begin shuttling several large metal pulleys off the sailboat. \n67 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 67 \nMud smiles, showing his missing tooth, as he looks over the load of items the boys have stacked in their boat. Neckbone tosses a loop of rope to him. \n61A. \nNECKBONE We've got more, but no motor. \nMUD This'll work for now. You get her my note? \n", "test2_true": "MUD Where'd you get that from? \nELLIS We came up on Juniper's room. A guy was in there beatin' up on her. Mud's face turns dark. \nNECKBONE Ellis rushed him. Got smacked for it. \nMUD What'd he look like? \nELLIS I don't know. Tall. Looked like a cowboy. \nMUD Dark hair? \nELLIS Yeah. \nMUD \nDAMMIT! Mud slings the rope to the ground and kicks it. His face is flushed. It's the first time the boys have seen him angry. \nMUD (CONT'D) \nGOD DAMMIT! The boys back up. Mud takes a deep breath, tries to cool down. It takes a moment, then something occurs to him. He eyes Ellis with a look of genuine gratitude. \nMUD (CONT'D) Thanks for lookin' after her. Ellis nods. Mud picks up the rope. \nMUD (CONT'D) His name's Carver. Brother of the man I shot. If he's here, then more are comin'. \nNECKBONE More what? Mud gathers the supplies and heads to the treeline. The boys, with their hands full, follow him. \nMUD Bounty hunters. Carver's rotten, but his daddy's the one to be scared of. He'll spend all the money he has to see me dead. If it was up to me I'd put the whole family down same as the other. Not a decent man between `em. Mud stops and turns to lay a serious look on them. \nMUD (CONT'D) Ya'll listen to me now. If you see that old man, don't get near him. He's the triple six real deal scratch you hear me? Mud waits for nods from them both. \nMUD (CONT'D) All right. \n68 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER/ISLAND - CONTINUOUS 68 \nGalen drifts in his own boat out on the Mississippi River. He stares at something in the distance. \nA68 FROM ACROSS THE RIVER, A68 He sees Neckbone and Ellis on the island walking with Mud. Galen, a concerned look on his face, keeps one hand on his motor and the other on a bulging net of mussel shells. His HELPER, a salty looking man in his fifties, sits at the front of the boat sipping Budweiser from the can. \nHELPER What you waitin' for? \nGALEN Shut up. After a moment, Galen cranks the motor and speeds away. \n69 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - DAY - LATER 69 \nMud stands with Ellis and Neckbone on the deck of the boat. He holds a pulley in one hand and a length of rope in the other. He stares up into the trees. \nMUD Ellis, can you climb up that trunk and get these hung? \nELLIS Yeah. \nMUD Take a foot of line and tie `em off with a bowline knot. You know it? \nELLIS I'm not stupid. Ellis takes the pulley and scales the trunk without hesitation. Mud tosses his pocket knife to Neckbone. \nMUD Neck, start cuttin' line. Three fifteen foot sections. Count a foot long as your arm. Mud begins threading the pulleys with rope. As Neckbone cuts rope, he sees the pistol stuck in the back of Mud's pants. \nNECKBONE What's so special `bout that shirt you'd lose your pistol for it? \nMUD It's got a wolf's eye sewn in the sleeve. More protection than a bullet ever gave. Tom swears by it. \nNECKBONE He said he wasn't your daddy. \nMUD Tom's the closest thing I ever knew to a father. \nNECKBONE I never met my parents. \nMUD It's hard not knowin' the ones you came from. \nNECKBONE My uncle Galen tells me things about `em. He's the one that takes care of me. \nMUD Tom did that for me. \n", "test2_id": 445, "test3_input": "Carver steps across the plank onto the houseboat followed by James. Carver motions him around back toward Ellis' window. \nCARVER Flush him out this way. Carver walks to the covered carport. \n152 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 152 \nIN THE DEN, The Hunters at the front door continue taking pot shots at the furniture. Mud flinches at each new round fired. \n153 IN ELLIS' ROOM, 153 \nEllis cautiously slides out from under his bed and crouches next to the bedroom door. He peeks through a crack. He sees Mud pinned behind the Lazy Boy. They make eye contact. Mud's eyes move to something behind Ellis. Ellis turns to see James passing by his bedroom window. \n154 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 154 \nTom scans Ellis' boat through the scope on his rifle. He sees Carver creeping around the carport. He pans right to find James taking a position near the patio doors. Tom pauses, seeing Ellis appear at the corner of the boat just behind James. \n155 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 155 \nThe firing from the front door has stopped. Mud takes a deep breath, sets the empty shotgun on the ground, then rushes out the sliding glass doors as the men out front reload. \n156 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/TOM'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 156 \nMud makes it outside, his back to James' leveled rifle. \nELLIS \nMUD! James and Mud both turn at the sound of Ellis' voice. One of Tom's bullets drops James dead. Carver appears at the carport end of the boat. He raises his shotgun toward Mud. \nA156 ON TOM, A156 He snaps the bolt open and closed, but it jams. He jerks at the lever, looking up he sees Carver taking aim. \n157 ON MUD, 157 Mud takes a running leap off the side of the boat. Carver FIRES. Mud is struck in the back by the shotgun blast. The force of the shot spins him in the air. He crashes into the water. Ellis screams. \nELLIS (CONT'D) \nMUD! Carver approaches the edge of the boat. He stares down into the swirling dark water. No sign of Mud. \nA157 ON TOM, A157 Tom slaps open the bolt and yanks the spent cartridge out with his fingers. It BURNS. \nTOM \nDAMMIT! \nON CARVER, He pumps the shotgun and fires into the murky water. The pellets pepper the surface. Still no sign of Mud. Carver pumps the shotgun a final time, but before he can get another shot off Tom's bullet rips open Carver's chest sending him sprawling through the broken patio doors. \nON TOM, He exhales, shucks the bolt once more. His eyes scan the dark water. \n158 ON THE HOUSEBOAT, 158 Ellis runs to the edge of the boat. \nELLIS \nMUD! MUD! Senior exits the houseboat, pistol pointed. He sees Ellis and runs to him. \nSENIOR \nELLIS! Senior grabs the boy, keeping his pistol up. Ellis drops to his knees and Senior crouches with him, holding him tight in his arms. Ellis cries. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) It's okay. It's okay. The two sit alone on the edge of the houseboat. The river seems especially quiet now. \n159 I/E. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 159 The sky shows faint signs of morning, a few streaks of light. \nON THE RIVERBANK, The blue, red, and white lights from police cruisers and ambulances bounce up into the trees. A frenzy of Police activity swarms from the aftermath left on Ellis' houseboat. Men in wetsuits prepare a dive. Blanket covered bodies are wheeled off on gurneys. \nTwo of the Bounty Hunters, unharmed, sit locked in the back of a state trooper vehicle. \n160 ON THE HOUSEBOAT, 160 Ellis, Senior and Mary Lee sit huddled together under the carport. They watch the emergency workers stream past. Senior wraps his arms around them. Ellis looks across the bayou to Tom's boat. Police flashlights bob and weave throughout. No sign of Tom. \n161 INSIDE ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT, 161 A LOCAL OFFICER strings caution tape across the broken patio doors. TWO STATE TROOPERS hover over Carver's body. The Troopers step away and the Local Officer cranes toward the body. He studies Carver's face. Stepping aside, the Officer takes a cell phone from his pocket and dials. He turns his back away from the Troopers. \n162 INT. PINES MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 162 \nThe phone rings in the Pines Motel. King enters from the adjoining room and takes a seat on the bed. He answers. \nKING Hello...You're speaking to him... King listens. His face taut. \n", "test3_true": "163 EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 163 \nIt's dark on the river. Moonlight barely shows the ripples in the slow moving current. MUSIC from a country station slips out across the surface of the water. Galen's jambox sits next to a small lantern in his flat- bottom boat. His Helper snores, fully reclined, with an empty can of Budweiser resting on his gut. His feet are propped next to a tiny bell rigged to a line that disappears into the water. The bell RINGS. \n164 EXT. UNDERWATER - RIVER - NIGHT 164 \nThe river bed swirls inside two, distinct spots of light. \nGalen, using his new diving lights, scoops a final mussel shell into the net before tying it off. He tugs at the line. It's pitch black save for the shafts of light projected from Galen's shoulders. He tilts the lights toward the surface. The line leading up to the bottom of the boat dances in and out of the high beams. Then... \nMUD'S BODY FLOATS BY OVERHEAD. Only his backside is visible. A cloud of blood trails from the holes there. \nFADE TO BLACK. \n165 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DAY 165 \nA WORKER cinches a thick strap across the deck of Ellis' houseboat. \n166 ON THE RIVERBANK, 166 Ellis watches as WORKERS affix straps from his houseboat to a crane resting in the bed of a large truck on the bank. The SOUND of Neckbone's dirt bike rattles through the trees. He appears behind Ellis and parks. \nNECKBONE Hey. \nELLIS You got your bike back. \nNECKBONE Mud dinged the shit out of it. Neckbone takes a seat next to Ellis. They watch the workers. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) They're really doin' it. \nELLIS It's the law. \nNECKBONE It's bullshit. They ever find Tom? The boys focus on Tom Blankenship's boat across the bayou. It sits vacant, covered in police tape. \nELLIS No. He's gone. \nNECKBONE Your dad not here? \nELLIS Said he couldn't watch it. He's pickin' me up in a minute. Got deliveries today. They sit in silence as the Workers exit off the houseboat. \nNECKBONE Heard on the news. They still hadn't found Mud's body. Ellis nods. \nNECKBONE (CONT'D) You think he's dead? \nELLIS I don't know. I hope not. The crane begins lifting up the houseboat. The metal wires tighten and the entire structure creaks. A sucking sound as the flotilla separate from the water. The boat hangs, suspended in the air. A HORN HONKS behind the boys. Ellis turns to see Senior's truck. \nELLIS (CONT'D) I gotta go. Come by the apartment. Help me set my room up. \nNECKBONE All right. Neckbone watches Ellis climb into the bed of the pick-up and take his spot on the coolers. The sound of twisting metal shifts his attention back to the houseboat being swung over a flatbed semi. \n167 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 167 \nIN THE CAB, Senior glances at the houseboat being set on the flatbed. He puts the truck in reverse and pulls away. Not looking back. \n168 EXT. SENIOR'S TRUCK/IMAGES OF DEWITT - DAY 168 \nEllis rides in the back of the truck on top of the coolers. He watches the town pass by. A168 The marina junkyard. The Sonic. Downtown. A168 \nB168 EXT. FLEA MARKET - DAY B168 \nEllis and his father unload a cooler at the back of a tented flea market. A WOMAN comes out to greet them. \n169 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/NEW APARTMENTS - DAY 169 Senior's truck pulls into the parking lot of a newly finished apartment complex. The two-story buildings are modest. The truck idles out front. \nINSIDE THE CAB, Ellis grabs the door handle. He turns to Senior. \nELLIS I'll see you next week? \nSENIOR Yeah. Ellis begins to get out but stops when Senior speaks. \nSENIOR (CONT'D) Ellis? You mind your mother okay? This is a big change for her. She needs your support. \nELLIS Yessir. \nSENIOR All right. I love you. \n", "test3_id": 446}

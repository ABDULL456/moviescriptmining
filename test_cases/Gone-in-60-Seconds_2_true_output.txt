DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ... 
MEMPHIS What do you want from me? 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ... 
And with that, he starts his car ... Drives off... Memphis gazing after him... 
INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT 
Memphis drives. Kip beside him. They drive in silence. At last coming to: 
EXT. TEN-TON TRANSFER COMPANY - FRONT GATES 
A huge trucking company warehouse. Kip gets out. Bolt-cuts the chain-fence out front. 
And Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan CAR CARRIERS here. He picks one ... 
MEMPHIS This one ... 
He slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing. 
Then, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds a little DEVICE. 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) What's that thing -- ? 
KIP Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ... 
MEMPHIS How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...? 
KIP After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ... 
MEMPHIS Thank-you ... 
KIP De nada ... 
He gets behind the wheel. Pops the ignition. The truck's flipping stack belches. Memphis climbs in next to him. 
MEMPHIS Ain't we good-timing here ... ? 
KIP The family that steals together, deals together... 
MEMPHIS Dad'd be proud -- 
KIP Maybe not. But Dad was from another era... 
MEMPHIS What era was that -- ? 
KIP The era when crime didn't pay -- 
MEMPHIS As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher? 
KIP Price of doing business... 
MEMPHIS What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ? 
KIP It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?" 
And he grins and puts the truck into gear. And off they go 
INT. OTTO'S AUTO - GARAGE - NIGHT 
The Replacements chime in with "Someone Take The Wheel." Memphis and the crew ... All but Sway are present. 
Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop ... To a window ... He gestures outside to where we see and UNMARKED CAR and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... Staking them out ... 
MEMPHIS We've got to shake them tomorrow night. I'm making that your problem. That's called delegation of duties. You like it -- ? 
Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops ... 
MIRROR MAN Sure, man -- 
And they follow him back into the garage ... 
MEMPHIS Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each team has been assigned their ladies. The teams are: me and Sway. Donny and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror Man, you and The Sphinx ... 
Mirror Man looks horrified ... 
MIRROR MAN Aw, c'mon, man ... 
The Sphinx grins at him... 
TOBY What about me? 
MEMPHIS You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ... 
TOBY How come ... ? 
MEMPHIS Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ... 
TOBY Come on. Kip, talk to the guy 
KIP There's no talkin' to him -- 
And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some paper cups ... 
OTTO (cup raised) To a safe and successful session of bumping fenders and trading paint. 
Everyone toasts ... Drinks ... Donny goes to the tape deck... Hits PLAY ... And "Little Deuce Coupe" by The Beach Boys BLASTS. ("Little Deuce Coupe/You don't know what I got...") 
And all of our guys dance to it ... Singing along ... Otto dances with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto parts ... 
BEACH BOYS "Well, I'm not braggin,' babe So don't put me down But I got the fastest set of wheels in town, etc."

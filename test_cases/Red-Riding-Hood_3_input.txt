INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT 
Isabelle stands at the barred door. Grandmother is on the other side. They speak in furtive whispers. 
GRANDMOTHER I'm not going to let these worthless shits sacrifice you to save themselves. We have to find the real werewolf before tomorrow night. 
ISABELLE That's impossible. Even Father Solomon doesn't have the first clue. 
GRANDMOTHER Father Solomon doesn't know the things that I know. (off Isabelle's look) I am the oldest person in this village who was here when the Wolf first came. I remember the old days. And what is happening now is much worse. 
ISABELLE What was it like in the old days? 
GRANDMOTHER The Wolf never used to attack in the open like it did at the festival. It's a coward at heart. It would kill whole families in their homes, but it always stayed in the shadows. It never would have shown itself in the old days. 
ISABELLE It's grown bold. 
GRANDMOTHER Or perhaps it made a mistake. 
(BEAT) You're at the center of this. At least two of the victims can be tied to you. What if it had to kill so many at the festival to hide the fact that the first two killings weren't random? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Isabelle considers this. A beat as she realizes... 
ISABELLE But who would want to kill Lucie? 
GRANDMOTHER Your parents said that the Wolf broke into the house and took Lucie. We both know that's not true. What really happened? Isabelle hesitates, reluctant. 
ISABELLE My mother made me swear I would never speak of it. 
(BEAT) Lucie went to the Wolf willingly. Grandmother reacts, horrified. 
GRANDMOTHER Why would you think such a thing? 
ISABELLE She was in love with Henri. 
GRANDMOTHER She took her own life over a boy? 
ISABELLE What other explanation is there? Grandmother thinks. The pieces are fitting together... 
EXT. STABLE - NIGHT 
Grandmother knocks on a door. Henri answers. 
GRANDMOTHER Hello, Henri. 
INT. STABLE - NIGHT 
Henri is in the midst of shoeing a horse. Grandmother stands by the door, watching him. 
GRANDMOTHER You spoke up very loudly in Isabelle's defense today. That was very brave. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HENRI I just said what I felt. 
GRANDMOTHER You're under no obligation to stand in her defense. You broke off your engagement to her. 
HENRI I never stopped caring about her. I would do anything for Isabelle. 
GRANDMOTHER As her sister would have done anything for you. (off his look) Lucie was in love with you. But you knew that, didn't you? 
HENRI I had no control over the way she felt. 
GRANDMOTHER She kept it secret from almost everyone. Even Isabelle didn't know. Did you tell anyone? 
HENRI Never.

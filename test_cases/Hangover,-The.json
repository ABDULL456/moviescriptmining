{"test1_input": "THE FRONT DESK A perfectly pressed LEBANESE MAN waits behind the front desk. Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still on. \nFRONT DESK MAN Welcome to the Mandalay Bay. \nVICK Checking in. Lennon comma Victor. The man types into his computer. \nFRONT DESK MAN Yes, we have you down for a one night stay in an economy suite-- Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads \"ATASHIR.\" \nVICK Hold it right there, Atashir. This is my best friend from childhood, Douglas Billings. In two days, he is to marry a woman of great beauty and strong teeth, do you understand? A woman of gigantic bosoms who will give him many, many sons... Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed. \nVICK (CONT'D) My two other childhood friends have travelled great distances, across many deserts, to be here. This isn't a night in a hotel for us, Atashir: this is a family reunion. Perhaps you too have family situated great distances away, in a foreign country with much sand? Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter and touches his arm, simpatico. \nVICK (CONT'D) Then I have but one question for you, friend: if they came to town, would you put them in an economy suite? \nATASHIR No, sir. \nVICK Well, then. I think one of us needs to get back on his little computer and find us a suitable room. Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer. \nATASHIR All the deluxe rooms are taken. The Dean Martin suite is available, but I'd have to ask my-- \nVICK Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case of Cristal, two bottles of Patron, four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of skinless mangos... Vick turns to the guys: \nVICK (CONT'D) You guys want anything? The guys stammer, too stunned to speak. \nVICK (CONT'D) And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen of those duck skewers I like so well. He knows the ones. \nATASHIR And how would you like to pay? \nVICK American Express. Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns to Alan: \nVICK (CONT'D) Dude, give him your AmEx. \nALAN What? \nVICK Don't worry, we'll hit you later. Alan stammers. \nVICK (CONT'D) Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop being such a Jew. Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT \nThe guys enter the room, jostling; Stu has Doug in a headlock. Then they freeze: the Dean Martin Suite is massive, complete with lounge area, two flat screen TVs, full bar and multiple bedrooms. The guys just gape. \nSTU This is bigger than my house. Vick blows past them, totally unfazed. \nVICK Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels up in ten. Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite. \nALAN I am so not getting paid back. \nINT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nVick enters the bedroom, drops his bag, and starts changing his shirt -- when his cell phone RINGS. He answers. \nVICK This is Vick. \nVick listens -- then grows a bit panicked: \nVICK (CONT'D) He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me! \n(WINCING) All right, I'll get it. All right. All right--! When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone, trying to keep the call confidential: \nVICK (CONT'D) I said all right, dude! How many more times you want me to say all right?! \n(BEAT) All right. All right. Vick hangs up, looking uncharacteristically stressed... \nINT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- BATHROOM -- SAME \n", "test1_true": "ALAN So, you ready for Sunday? \nDOUG Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but I'm actually just really psyched. Alan nods, impressed. \nALAN Tracy's dad still hate you? \nDOUG Oh yeah. \nALAN Any closer to figuring out why? \nDOUG Enh, I think he wanted more for his girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who makes 45 grand a year, and he's a titan of industry who makes 45 grand a day, you know? I sort of get it... (beat, brushing teeth) Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm not sure you ever get past that. \nAlan smiles, yeah, there's that. Doug spits out his paste. \nDOUG (CONT'D) You got floss? Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up, starts looking for the floss. Then Alan remembers something -- but it's too late. Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING. \nDOUG (CONT'D) Holy Christ! Alan quickly reaches for the ring-- \nALAN Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell anyone about that-- Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable. \nSTU Anyone got any nipple lube--? (seeing ring) Jesus would you look at the size of that thing?! Stu grabs the ring from Doug. \nDOUG It's Alan's. For Becky. \nSTU Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy? \nALAN (clutching for ring) Actually, I-I was trying to keep it a secret, so-- Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate: \nVICK Boy Party in the bathrooooom--! (sees ring, snags it) Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight pink tint, street value: 26, 27K. Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples. \nSTU Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's finally going to propose! \nVICK Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good for you! Where'd you get the ring? \nALAN Oh, it's a family heirloom. My grandmother smuggled it through the Holocaust, actually. I was going to propose to Beck this weekend. Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him. \nDOUG Well: now we have two things to celebrate! \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"FRIDAY, 6:10 PM\" \nEXT. MANDALAY BAY ROOFTOP -- NIGHT \nThe guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses. Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the door and the frame so they aren't locked up here. The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the stunning panorama...the Strip...the mountains...the countless stars... It's breathtaking. \nSTU Thish is so great! I love you guys! \nVICK Check it out, Stu's already wasted. Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses. \nALAN We've only had two shots, man! \nDOUG Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You used to be able to drink us all under the table! \nSTU Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time to get plastered anymore! It blows! \n(QUICKLY) Am I a bad dad for saying that? \nDOUG What? No! \nSTU Because my dad was a bad dad. \nDOUG (patting his shoulder) That's true, Stuey, but you're different. We've talked about this. Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat. \nSTU Have I showed you guys pictures of my kids yet--? \n", "test1_id": 513, "test2_input": "ALAN Yeah, Stu, I really do. \nVICK Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be cool... Just then the Valet drives up in \nVICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off- roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood. The guys just stand there, agape. \nSTU You okay, Vick? \nVICK I'm not emotionally prepared to talk about it just yet, Stuart, but thank you. Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE GUYS ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS, even NUNS, point and stare. Our guys just face forward, each quietly suffering in their own personal Hell. \nALAN Seriously: what am I gonna tell Becky? For 14 years she's been begging me to get married... \nVICK Well, now you did. Just not to her. Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up-- \nALAN Wait, is that homeless guy wearing Doug's shirt? The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before. Once they pass, the guys exchange a look. \nSTU Naaah. \nVICK Yeah, that was a different shirt. Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then: \nVICK (CONT'D) Left turn. Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so as not to fall out of the car as they turn left... \nEXT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY \nSitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding Chapel. The Cadillac parks in the lot out front. \nINT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY \nEverything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white plastic. White plastic plants, white plastic cross, white plastic chairs. The guys enter. \nALAN What if they don't remember us--? \nVOICE BEHIND THEM \nAAAAYYYYY! The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island. \nSTEVE How are you, you dumb bastards?! \nHe warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar... \nSTEVE (CONT'D) \nCARLA, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT HERE! \nALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE! (to the guys) You here to pick up your wedding photos?! Alan starts to decline, when-- \nVICK Does the pope wear a funny hat?! Let's do this thing! Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls. \nSTEVE And where is Chastity today? They all sit on white plastic chairs. \nALAN W-Who's...Chastity? \nSTEVE \n(LAUGHING) Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just breaking my balls! Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table. Vick eagerly peruses them, enjoying this. \nVICK Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn't it? \nSTEVE Hand to God, I've never seen two people more in love! \nVICK Sadly, I believe you... The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor. They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk. The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara. \nVICK (CONT'D) Hello, Chastity... Alan just closes his eyes, oh God. \n", "test2_true": "STU Jesus, she is stacked. \nVICK Stu, please, show some class. That's Alan's wife you're talking about. \nSTU (to Alan, guilty) Sorry. She looks really nice. But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel. (It is, of course, a rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head.) \nALAN We got a unicorn?! \nSTEVE Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double Camelot Package. Alan just rubs his temples, oh no. \nALAN A-And how much did that cost? \nSTEVE 7 thousand dollars. Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way! \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Yeah, you didn't want to get it, either, but Vick insisted. Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick! \nALAN I'm gonna kill you! \nVICK (fending him off) You can't put a pricetag on love, Alan! OW! You just can't! \nStu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick. \nVOICE BEHIND THEM \nSTOP FIGHTING IMMEDIATELY! The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife CARLA, 40's, enters. She's wearing a toga, smoking a menthol, and dollying in several large CARDBOARD BOXES. Then she grins: \nCARLA Ahhh! I'm just busting your nuts! She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs. \nCARLA (CONT'D) Good to see you, you stupid mooks! Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is. Vick, on the other hand, steps forward and hugs her tightly. \nVICK It's good to be seen, Carla. It's good to be seen. \nCARLA I brought the rest of your package. Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes. \nCARLA (CONT'D) First: Two dozen commuter mugs... She unpacks 24 COMMUTER MUGS with Alan and Chastity's photo emblazoned on them. Alan winces, oh god. Stu grabs one: \nSTU No way! Awesome! \nSTEVE A hundred DVDs of the ceremony... She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan: \nVICK For you and Chastity to watch on your anniversary... Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you. \nCARLA The velvet wall hanging... She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet WALL HANGING of Alan and Chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space. \nVICK And it looks like real velvet, Alan, so no machine wash, okay? \nCARLA And the big finish: Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited... Then Carla pulls out a FOUR FOOT BRONZE SHIELD with a bas- relief of Alan and Chastity MAKING OUT on it. Alan just closes his eyes. \nSTU \nHOLY CRAP! \nVICK \nDUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD! \nSTU I want a shield! \nVICK Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a shield? \nALAN I don't suppose you have any sort of return policy, do you? \nSTEVE Um...if you know another couple who looks exactly like you guys, and who want two dozen commuter mugs, a wall hanging, and a shield...sure. Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it without looking at the Caller ID. \nALAN What. We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge. \n", "test2_id": 514, "test3_input": "STU I can't believe you just saved my life! \nVICK I can't believe you just drove my car into Jimmy Lang! Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers. \nSTU He's gonna be really upset! \nALAN Yeah, I was just thinking that! \nBACK ON JIMMY LANG The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor. His two henchmen waddle up, highly concerned. \nKIKIOLANI Boss, Boss, you okay?! Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious. \nJIMMY LANG Find Vick... And kill him. \nINT. VICK'S CAR -- DAWN \nThe guys race down the dusty highway in traumatized silence. \nALAN Now can we call Tracy? \nVick frowns and blots his split lip with his sleeve. \nVICK Yeah. It's probably time. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- LONE PAYPHONE -- DAWN \nThe guys pull up at a lone, dusty payphone in the middle of the desert. They all look at the phone. \nALAN Who wants to make the call? Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close. \nSTU That was you! \nALAN What?! No! I beat you by a mile! \nSTU Vick, who won?! \nVICK \n(FROWNING) Actually...I should do it. This weekend was mostly my fault. I need to Man Up. Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound sense of responsibility. \nALAN Well, I'll be damned... Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat. \nVICK I still can't believe Stu banged my sister. Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the pay phone... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY \nTracy is putting on her makeup in the bridal suite. Her stern dad blows in. \nMR. TURNER Any word from Doug? The way he spits out \"Doug\" tells us all we need to know about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law. \nTRACY No, but I'm sure he's-- Just then, Tracy's CELL PHONE rings. She quickly answers it. \nTRACY (CONT'D) Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nVICK In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted aviators into the rising sun. \nVICK Tracy, it's Vick. \nTRACY Hey Vick! \nVICK Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug. \n", "test3_true": "VICK Yeah, that's not gonna happen... \nBACK IN THE CAR Alan starts to take a pull of Patron -- when he freezes, realizing something! \nBACK TO VICK on the phone with Tracy, being genuinely contrite. \nVICK Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This is all my fault-- \nSuddenly, Alan flies out of nowhere and snatches the receiver out of Vick's hand! \nVICK (CONT'D) What the--?! Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing. \nALAN Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just joking around! We've got Doug right here! Vick looks like: what?! \nTRACY \n(HORRIFIED) What kind of joke is that?! \nALAN I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll see you at the wedding! Bye! Alan hangs up and races back to the car. Vick follows. \nVICK What are you doing? \nALAN I know where Doug is! \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY \nTracy stands in her bridal suite. Then she just BREAKS DOWN SOBBING. Her father hurries over, concerned... \nCUT BACK TO: \nEXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAY \nAlan floors the car back onto the 15 towards Vegas, amped! \nALAN Remember when we saw Doug's bed impaled on the griffin thing?! \nSTU Yeah, we threw it out the window. \nALAN No: the windows don't open, remember?! \nVICK So how did--? \n(REALIZING) Oh my God. \nSTU I don't get it. \nALAN And that's why we've been seeing Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He was trying to signal someone! \nVICK I don't believe it... \nSTU I-I still don't get it-- \nALAN And it totally jives with the timeline, right?! We brought Doug back to the hotel at 5:00, he was passed out... \nVICK It's so obvious! \nSTU Not...to me...so much? \nVICK How'd you figure it out?! \nALAN The Patron, man! It reminded me of our first drink of the night! \nVICK Honestly, dude, you're a genius. \n", "test3_id": 515}

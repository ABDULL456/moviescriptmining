{"train": "THE HANGOVER \nWritten by \nJon Lucas & Scott Moore \nSeptember 30, 2007 \nEXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- PACIFIC PALISADES, CA -- MORNING \nIt's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB. Workers bustle about the lawn, setting up a high-end wedding. A STRING QUARTET warms up. A team of FLORISTS arrange centerpieces. CATERERS set the white linen tables... \nINT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY \nA simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in this sun-drenched bridal suite. Sitting at the makeup table, surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY TURNER, 20's. She's busy doing her makeup. Just then, Tracy's rich, stern FATHER, 50's, blows in. \nMR. TURNER Any word from Doug? The way he spits out \"Doug\" tells us all we need to know about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law. \nTRACY No, but I'm sure he's-- Just then, Tracy's CELLPHONE rings. She quickly answers it. \nTRACY (CONT'D) Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nEXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- MORNING \nHeat-waves rise off the Mojave. Standing at a lone, dust- covered payphone in the middle of the desert is \nVICK LENNON He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess. His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent, his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days. \nVICK Tracy, it's Vick. Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967 Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy - - and missing its passenger side door. Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell. \nTRACY Hey Vick! \nVICK Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug. \nTRACY (her jaw dropping) What?! But we're getting married in like four hours! Vick squints at the rising sun. \nVICK Yeah, that's not gonna happen. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE OVER BLACK: 40 HOURS EARLIER \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAY \nThe top down, The Who's \"Baba O'Riley\" blasting from the stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down Highway 10 towards Nevada. At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half- open shirt and mint condition aviators. Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's, handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy. Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead. Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is. \nSTU Dude this is already the best weekend ever! \nVICK Stu, relax, we're still on the 10. \nSTU Oh, did I show you pictures of my kids?! \nDOUG No, dude, show `em. Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together. \nSTU Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is already four! Can you believe it?! \nDOUG (smiling at photos) How cute... Good for you, man. Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed. \nVICK The one on the left is gonna be a hottie. The other one, not so much. Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering: \nSTU Jesus, dude, those are my children-- \nALAN (re: sunscreen) Hey, am I rubbed in? Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over Alan's face. \nALAN & DOUG & VICK \nYES! Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt: \nDOUG Little toast: to Tracy, the coolest, kindest, most beautiful woman I've ever met. I can't believe she let me come this weekend -- much less agreed to spend the rest of her life with me. I think both will prove to be massive errors of judgement on her part. The guys chuckle, hear-hear. \nDOUG (CONT'D) And to being here, with my best friends in the world. There's nowhere else I'd rather be. The guys raise their glasses, touched. \nDOUG (CONT'D) That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay? I'm getting married in 36 hours. \nALAN & STU & VICK No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally, dude. Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced. \nDOUG I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above the neck -- no piercings, no weird haircuts, no facial tattoos. I gotta look decent on Sunday. \nVICK Jesus, what do you take us for? \nDOUG Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows off the night before graduation! \nSTU Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And remember when I blacked out at Homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent marker?! That was awesome! What'd you write again? \nALAN & DOUG & VICK \"Respect me!\" They all laugh. Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic. \nSTU Ahh, good times, man. Good times... \nVICK We'll be good tonight, Doug. \nALAN Seriously, man, we're your friends. \nSTU Yeah, we've totally grown up since then. Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass. \nDOUG Well then...to a night we'll never forget. They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, and \nSMASH CUT TO: \nTHE NEXT MORNING Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into \nTHE DEAN MARTIN SUITE THE CAMERA follows a LIVE CHICKEN as it walks through the totalled suite. Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans, platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc. SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe, the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu. \nTITLE CARD: \"SATURDAY, 11:15AM\" The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path. Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu. The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the couch, onto a pile of newspapers. \nPILE OF NEWSPAPERS OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus! Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain. \nVICK Damn, dude, why are you retarded? Both men are ragingly hungover. A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then: \nVICK (CONT'D) Um, Stuey? \nSTU Yo. \nVICK Why do you have a mullet? Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too hungover to understand. \nSTU What? \nVICK You know, business on top, party down the back? Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick. \nVICK (CONT'D) Your hair, dude. You have a mullet. Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom. After a beat, we hear his voice: \nSTU (O.S.) Dude...I have a mullet. Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy: \nALAN (O.S.) Just give me ten more minutes, Beck... \nSTU (O.S.) Whoa, did you sleep in the tub? Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom. \nSTU (CONT'D) Check it out: Alan slept in the tub. \nVICK Get him up. I'm hungry. Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken: \nALAN (O.S.) Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?! There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat. Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan stumble out of the bathroom. Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut off at his chest -- he's naked from there down. \nALAN What an asshole. Stu, check the pool and the casino, I'll check the room and the gym. Maybe he's working out or something... Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth. \nALAN (CONT'D) And Vick, if you could keep a close eye on the buffet, that'd be really helpful. Thanks, man. Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full: \nVICK \nHE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING! \nVick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER \nAlan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake. \nALAN Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man. Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes him a second to realize what's wrong: \nTHE BED IS MISSING There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay. Alan scratches his head. \nALAN That's weird... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANDALAY BAY -- POOL -- DAY \nStu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool. Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted! \nSTU No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's totally cool... \nCUT TO: \nINT. GYM -- DAY \nAlan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug. The place is packed with fit people, working out. Alan mumbles to himself: \nALAN I hate you all... \nCUT TO: \nINT. CASINO FLOOR -- NICKEL SLOTS \nStu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud: \nSTU \nDOUG! DOUG! Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands. \nGAY MAN Hey Stu. \nSTU Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--! Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone. Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan talking to Atashir at \nTHE RECEPTION DESK He slowly bow-legs himself over. \nSTU You find Doug? \nALAN No, I assume you didn't either? Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone. \nATASHIR There is no Doug Billings at any of the area hospitals, morgues, or police stations. The guys frown, starting to grow worried. \nSTU Maybe he went for a jog? \nALAN Dude. It's 120 degrees outside. \nSTU Or shopping? The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot. \nALAN Great. So we've officially lost Doug. His wedding is in what, 22 hours? \nALAN Jesus, what is it? \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nVick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans. \nVICK I can't believe we're doing this. \nSTU You don't have to look up my butt, just at it. Something is terribly, terribly wrong... Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes. \nHe's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with \"I ROGER\" written vertically down the front. In glitter. \nALAN Sweet mother of mercy... \nVICK Who's Roger? \nSTU I-I-I don't know?! What do you think it means?! \nVICK What do I think it means? Well, Stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude -- I don't think we need the CSI team for this one! You got reamed last night, man! Stu covers his mouth, horrified! \nALAN I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this... \nSTU Really?! What?! Alan tries to think of one. \nALAN Yeah, maybe there isn't. \nVICK Look, I'm sure Roger is a very nice, considerate young man-- \nSTU Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?! \nVICK Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near cool enough. \nSTU (gasping, realizing) I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids! \nALAN Oh god, that doesn't mean you're gay. \nVICK But sort of...it does? Stu grows increasingly frantic. \nSTU And once, I caught myself gazing at a topless photo of David Beckham! \nALAN So what, he's a great-looking dude-- \nSTU And then I had those weird feelings for Vick that time in middle school, remember?! Everyone stops. Vick most of all. \nVICK Um, what? \nSTU Yeah, that weekend we were all camping -- I told you this. \nVICK Yeah, no you didn't. \nSTU I didn't? \nVICK I think I'd remember, dude. \nALAN Yeah, I think we'd all remember. \nSTU Yeah. I had weird feelings for you that weekend. Like really hot, really gay feelings. But then they went away. Vick is just looking at him, stunned. \nALAN Wait -- I was there that weekend. Did you have gay feelings for me? \nVICK Unbelievable. \nALAN What?! I was a good-looking kid! \nVICK Please, you're so not his type! \nALAN Yeah, Stu, I really do. \nVICK Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be cool... Just then the Valet drives up in \nVICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off- roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood. The guys just stand there, agape. \nSTU You okay, Vick? \nVICK I'm not emotionally prepared to talk about it just yet, Stuart, but thank you. Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE GUYS ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS, even NUNS, point and stare. Our guys just face forward, each quietly suffering in their own personal Hell. \nALAN Seriously: what am I gonna tell Becky? For 14 years she's been begging me to get married... \nVICK Well, now you did. Just not to her. Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up-- \nALAN Wait, is that homeless guy wearing Doug's shirt? The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before. Once they pass, the guys exchange a look. \nSTU Naaah. \nVICK Yeah, that was a different shirt. Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then: \nVICK (CONT'D) Left turn. Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so as not to fall out of the car as they turn left... \nEXT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY \nSitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding Chapel. The Cadillac parks in the lot out front. \nINT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY \nEverything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white plastic. White plastic plants, white plastic cross, white plastic chairs. The guys enter. \nALAN What if they don't remember us--? \nVOICE BEHIND THEM \nAAAAYYYYY! The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island. \nSTEVE How are you, you dumb bastards?! \nHe warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar... \nSTEVE (CONT'D) \nCARLA, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT HERE! \nALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE! (to the guys) You here to pick up your wedding photos?! Alan starts to decline, when-- \nVICK Does the pope wear a funny hat?! Let's do this thing! Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls. \nSTEVE And where is Chastity today? They all sit on white plastic chairs. \nALAN W-Who's...Chastity? \nSTEVE \n(LAUGHING) Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just breaking my balls! Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table. Vick eagerly peruses them, enjoying this. \nVICK Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn't it? \nSTEVE Hand to God, I've never seen two people more in love! \nVICK Sadly, I believe you... The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor. They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk. The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara. \nVICK (CONT'D) Hello, Chastity... Alan just closes his eyes, oh God. \nALAN (CONT'D) Oh, hey Becky! Hi! He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla: \nVICK That's his girlfriend of 14 years. I'm sure this'll only take a minute... \nVick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan tries to talk to his furious girlfriend. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nBECKY in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase. She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set. \nBECKY Can you tell me why all the goddamn credit cards are maxed out?! \nALAN No! I-I have no idea--! Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed: \nVICK \nHEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR \nBEST MAN, DUDE! \nSTU \nYEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER! \nWHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?! Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard. \nBECKY \"Your best man?!\" What's going on there, Alan?! \nALAN Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS \nARE JUST BEING DICKS! \nVICK \nHEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET- \nSIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I \nBOGART A FEW?! Alan furiously flips them off, shut up! \nBECKY I really don't appreciate being mocked right now, Alan, especially about wedding-related issues. You know how hard this weekend is going to be for me. \nALAN I know, baby! I know-- \nBECKY So you'll call the credit card company and straighten this out? \nALAN Yes. I will. I promise. \nBECKY Okay. Okay... (beat, calming) Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll see you soon, okay? Love you. But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making out with his blonde bombshell wife... \nBECKY (CONT'D) Alan? Hello? I said I love you?! \nALAN Yes, no, I love you too! Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable. STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales. \nSTU Hey, how's Becky doing, man?! \nVICK Yeah, did she ask about us?! Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we \nCUT TO: \nSTEVE AND THE GUYS SCHLEPPING ALL OF THE WEDDING CRAP through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car. Alan sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD. \nSTU Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick found a great clue. \nVICK Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos, which means -- if the time stamp was right -- we had him in our possession until 11 pm. \nSTU That's another hour of last night that we can account for. Isn't that great? \nKALOLO FANALUA We're from Guam, bitch! Now get outta the car! \nVICK Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat! Jesus, why is everyone trying to kill my car...? Vick undoes his seatbelt   and reaches for his door handle. Kikiolani lowers his bat   -- and Vick throws the door open, right into his nuts! The   huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and Vick slams his door shut   and \nFLOORS IT OUT OF THERE IN REVERSE! The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the street! They SQUEAL AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out of the backseat as they do! It CLATTERS on the pavement... \nEXT. EAST VEGAS STREET -- CONTINUOUS \nVick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge SPIDERWEB in the windshield. Alan and Stu are freaking out. \nALAN Why'd you do that?! \nVICK \n(INCREDULOUS) Really? \nSTU Maybe they just wanted to talk! \nVICK I honestly don't know how you two are still alive. \nALAN Do you think we stole something from them last night?! \nSTU Oh my god I am such a bad dad! \nALAN (producing cellphone) I'm calling the police. This is getting way out of control-- \nVICK No! No cops! \nALAN \"No cops?!\" Who are you, Fitty Cent?! \nSTU Yeah, Vick, what's going on? \nVICK Nothing! I just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing! \nALAN Every little thing?! We were just assaulted by the Yakuza! \nVICK Oh please, those guys are from Guam. Get a grip. \nALAN They knew your name, Vick! Which means they probably know who Stu and I are, too! \nSTU If anything ever happened to my family, Vick... \nVICK Fine. Let's just go back to the hotel -- Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we'll get him, we'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we'll get the hell back to LA, okay? Left turn. Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"SATURDAY, 2:26 PM\" \nINT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- DAY \nThe boys hurry into their room, stressed. \nVICK Doug? Doug? Alan quickly checks the room phone. \nALAN No messages. \nSTU Come on, let's toss the place. Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms... \nINT. BEDROOM \nStu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes, looking for anything relevant. He spots a LEGAL CONTRACT on the ground. Picks it up. \nSTU Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested 30 grand in your custard store last night! Vick calls from the other bedroom. \nVICK (O.S.) Smart move, man. Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes. \nSTU Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?! Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face. \nCHASTITY Sure, we met at the bar at like 10:00? Then we got married on my smoke break, which was like 11:00? \nVICK It's the All-American love story, isn't it? What happened next? \nCHASTITY Well, I had to go back to work. But when I got off at 5:30, I met up with you guys back here. \nVICK And was Doug with us then? \nCHASTITY No. \nVICK Interesting... Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding? \nCHASTITY No, but I bet some of my work friends do. You were partying with them pretty hard. \nSTU Work friends? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nSTRIPPERS Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles. \nINT. CRAZY HORSE GENTLEMEN'S CLUB -- DAY \nChastity leads the guys through Vegas's Most Notorious Strip Club, The Crazy Horse. It's bacchanalia writ large, complete with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages of spinning flesh. The place is mobbed with PATRONS. Alan follows after Chastity, horrified. \nALAN You work here? Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched. \nCHASTITY Yeah -- and this is the pole where we first met! She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER currently spins. Alan looks ill. \nCHASTITY (CONT'D) It's always been my lucky pole... \nALAN Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but-- \nCHASTITY \nHEY PLATINUM, CHECK IT OUT! She holds up her hand, showing off ALAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S RING to the stripper currently upside-down on the pole. \nPLATINUM THE STRIPPER Get it, girl! \nCHASTITY Come on, let's go meet my bridesmaids! \nShe hurries off, but Alan can't move. \nSTU Dude. \nVICK I know. \nALAN The Holocaust, man. Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder. \nVICK Look, we can get your grandmother's ring back. We just gotta go about it in the right way. \nALAN I have besmirched my people. \nSTU Don't be so hard on yourself, dude-- Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS. \nCHASTITY These were my bridesmaids, Anastasia and Starr! \nSTARR Hey, boys! Good to see you again! \nANASTASIA Mazel Tov--! \nALAN Please...don't. Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system: \nSTRIP CLUB D.J. \nOKAY, GUYS! LET'S GIVE A CRAZY \nHORSE SHOUT-OUT TO OUR HAPPY NEW \nSTU Is it weird that we're sitting this close watching? \nVICK Not for me. More watching in silence. \nSTU I really shouldn't be here. I have daughters. Then both of their heads angle the same way. \nVICK Not that can do that. \nSTU How can she do that without dislocating her hip? \nVICK Because she's been touched by God. They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately. \nVICK (CONT'D) Shit. They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized by Chastity. Vick grabs him. \nVICK (CONT'D) Alan, come on, man, we gotta go! \nALAN Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses-- Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette. \nVICK Come on, man! We got company! Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them! \nVICK (CONT'D) Chastity, honey, is there a back way out of here?! Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR. \nCHASTITY Come on! The guys race after her... \nINT. CRAZY HORSE -- BACK HALLWAY \nChastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers, cocktail waitresses, and barbacks. Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are slowed by all the foot traffic. Strippers SCREAM as they're bowled over by the obese Islanders. \nINT. CRAZY HORSE -- MAIN STAGE \nA spotlight holds on a CLOSED CURTAIN covering the main stage. Some sort of techno Limp Bizkit song is playing. \nSTRIPPER D.J. (O.S.) \nANNND ON STAGE ONE, PUT YOUR HANDS \nTOGETHER FOR...DOUBLE STAXXX! All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu blows through the curtain, out of breath. Beat. The patrons look at Stu, confused. Stu looks at them, equally so. The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan blow through the curtain after Stu. \nCHASTITY Come on! Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits the floor running! \nSTU Did she just do that in heels?! \nVICK I'm really starting to like this girl. The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and leaping over the patrons! Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the end of the runway clear the hell out of the way. \nCHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUB Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again, leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and, finally, sprinting out the front door! \nThe massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through a forest. Just as they're blowing out of the door, however, \nTHEY'RE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS being swung into their chests! SMASH! They both stumble backwards, and then four roided-up STRIP CLUB SECURITY GUARDS pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground. \nCRAZY HORSE SECURITY GUARD (to walkie talkie) Viper One, this is Rolling Thunder, we've subdued the targets, over. \nEXT. CRAZY HORSE -- DAY \nChastity and the guys hurry around the corner from the Crazy Horse, laughing, exhilarated from the chase. \nSTU Did you see them trample those tiny Japanese businessmen?! I think they killed like four of them! Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan. \nVICK Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't just a little fun... \nALAN That was...a little fun. Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb, lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get out and hurry for them, pointing, intense. \nLAS VEGAS POLICEMAN Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?! Stuart Pryce?! \nSTU \n(SCARED) Y-Yes?! \nVICK \n(UNBLINKING) Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do. \nOFFICER MERRIWEATHER If I find out you're lying to me, son, I will take all of you down, is that clear? \nOFFICER BLADEN You boys wouldn't last three hours in prison. \nVICK Stu might. Stu shakes his head, unbelievable. \nVICK (CONT'D) Now: are you gonna charge us with something, or are we free to go? The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat. \nOFFICER BLADEN Get outta here. Stu and Alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door. \nALAN Oh, thank you, Officers! \nSTU It was really nice meeting you--! \nOFFICER MERRIWEATHER If you know what's good for you, you'll get the hell out of Vegas. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- NIGHT \nDay has turned to night. Vick, Stu, and Alan descend the steps of the police station. The mood is grim. \nALAN Did you have to be such a dick?! \nVICK We got out, didn't we? \nALAN Yeah, four hours later! If we'd just cooperated with them-- \nVICK If we'd cooperated with them, we'd be in jail right now, Alan. They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab. Desperation is setting in. \nALAN What are we gonna do now? We've got zero leads on where Doug is! \nSTU Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30. The guys shake their heads, I don't know. \nSTU (CONT'D) Do you think he's okay--? \nVICK Stu, don't. Doug is fine. \nSTU I mean, we were hanging out with mobsters last night, man! They kill people for looking at `em weird--! \nVICK Stu: Doug is fine. \nSTU Or what if we like drove Doug out to the desert and left him, just as like a funny prank--?! \nVICK Stu! Enough! \nALAN \n(MUTTERING) I knew I shouldn't have come... \nVICK What did you just say? \nALAN I said I knew I shouldn't have come this weekend, Vick! \nVICK (getting heated) Is that right? \nALAN Yeah, that's right. I only came because Doug insisted. Vick steps towards Alan, heated. \nVICK Why do think you're so much better than us, dude?! \nALAN I don't -- I just think I'm better than you, Vick! And trust me, it's not that hard! You haven't changed one bit since high school! Jesus, you're 28 years old and you still talk back to cops?! Really?! \nVICK You're out of your depth, Alan-- \nSTU (torn, answers phone) Good evening, this is Stu! \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT \nIt's Tracy. She's sitting in her living room, on the phone. Her STERN FATHER sits nearby, as do other FAMILY MEMBERS. \nTRACY Stu, it's Tracy! His eyes bulging, Stu covers the phone and hisses: \nSTU It's Tracy! Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit. \nSTU (CONT'D) Why is she calling me?! \nVICK Because she knows you're the most easily tricked. \nALAN We have tell her we lost Doug. \nVICK No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu! Stu turns back to the phone, rattled. \nSTU Hey, Trace! W-What's going on? \nTRACY Oh, nothing, just here with my family... \nSTU Wow, that sounds amazing! \nTRACY Yeah...? Hey, you wouldn't happen to know where Doug is, would you? He said he'd be home by 5 for this dinner, and now it's almost 9:00. I tried his cell, but he didn't answer... \nSTU Ummmm........Hang on. (covering the mouthpiece) She wants to know where Doug is! \nVICK I'm working on it! Buy us some time! \nALAN No, just tell her the truth! Honesty is always the best policy! \nVICK What are you, retarded?! Honesty is never the best policy! Especially not with brides! \nSTU (lamely, to phone) Um, what'd you say? \nTRACY \n(FROWNING) I asked if you knew where Doug was. \nSTU Yeah, um, hang on. (to guys) She still wants to know! \nVICK Okay: tell her Alan got really drunk last night and fell down, and the doctor said not to move him for a few hours, but that we'll be back in time for the wedding. \nALAN Why do I have to be the one that fell over drunk?! \nVICK It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get over yourself! Stu: tell her! \nSTU (TO PHONE) Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a \nDOCTOR-- \nVICK Fell over drunk. \nSTU H-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a different doctor, not the one he fell on -- he said we couldn't move him until the wedding-- \nVICK For a few hours! We'll be home before the wedding! \nSTU But we're going to have the wedding at your home-- Tracy just looks really confused. Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu. \nVICK Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon? \nTRACY (now very concerned) Vick, what is going on? \nVICK Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen, Alan hurt his back last night, so we're gonna be laid up here for a bit, but I promise we'll have Doug home in time for the wedding, okay? \nTIGHT ON: STU'S HAND The first bar written on it is \"GhostBar.\" \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. GHOSTBAR -- NIGHT \nChastity and the guys blow in, each with a photo of Doug (in medieval armor) from Alan's wedding. As they move into the club, every single waiter, bartender, and busboy sees them and throws open their arms, heyyyy, remembering them! They flash the picture of Doug to anyone who'll look -- waiters, maitre d's, thugs, bachelorettes, fetishists, bikers, swingers, brides and grooms -- but all of them shake their heads, we have no idea where Doug is... \nINT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT \nStu crosses off \"GhostBar\" from his arm... \nINT. BODY ENGLISH NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT \nThe guys and Chastity enter and disperse. Again, everyone recognizes them and hugs them like returning heroes -- and again, no one remembers where they were taking Doug... \nINT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT \nStu crosses off another stamp from his arm... \nEXT. PURE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT \nThe BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line... \nINT. TAO NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT \nThe BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line... \nINT. ICE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT \nThe BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line... \nINT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT \nThe guys race through a shadier, more industrial area of town, their hopes dimming... \nSTU All right, this is the last place we went, \"Chaps.\" Vick rolls to a stop in front of... \nCHAPS NIGHTCLUB It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear. \nSTU You sure we came here...? Then they look up at the marquee. It reads \"CHAPS: HOME OF \nTHE GOLDEN PONY ALL MALE REVUE.\" \nALAN The Golden Pony. That's us. \nSTU Maybe I'll just wait in the car-- But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car. \nINT. CHAPS NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT \nThe guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop. It's got a kitschy barn theme, and hosts 200 TOPLESS DUDES in cowboy hats and short-shorts grinding on each other. \nVICK You think we would've remembered this... \nSTU Yeah, I don't think we came here... \nALAN Then why is your underwear nailed to the wall? The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads \"CHAPS WALL OF FAME.\" We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS. \nSTU Those could be anybody's. Thousands of people go to Colorado State-- \nALAN (looking more closely) Oh my God, are they autographed? \nVICK \n(READING) \"Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I     Chaps!\" \nSTU (realizing, stunned) I am so gay... Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling. \nROGER I know, I'm sort of over group stuff too, but Alan insisted. Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned. \nVICK You insisted?! Why'd you insist?! \nALAN I don't know! I don't know why I insisted! \nROGER Actually, after the anger went away, it was really quite tender. The guys look at each other, nauseous. \nSTU I'm really not sure we can be friends anymore... Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING. \nCHASTITY Guys: he's kidding. Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The guys all exhale, incredibly relieved. \nVICK Not cool, Roger. Not cool. \nALAN So what did happen last night? \nROGER Oh, well, you guys came in near the end of our last set, like 2ish. Doug pretty much dragged you in. \nALAN Really? Doug did? \nROGER Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug. Black guy, shaved head? The guys look at each other, confused. \nROGER (CONT'D) He's a cake designer, he said he met you guys at some sort of birthday party at the Rio? \nVICK (snapping his finger) The guy from the Jimmy Lang surveillance video. The guys nod, right. \nROGER Anyway, for the big finale of our show, we always bring someone on stage, and, well, Stu, you volunteered pretty aggressively. (to nearby dancer) Hey Dallas, do we have the video of last night's show? \nSTU No! That's cool, I don't need to see it-- \nVICK We must see that video. \nDALLAS It's in the machine. Roger nods and presses PLAY on a little VCR/TV combo sitting in front of his mirror. ON THE TV a very Brokeback, Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing. Stu GASPS. Roger fast forwards. \nROGER You were pretty mellow at first, Stu, but once we got you into the chaps, you really came alive-- oh, here it is. \nON THE TV we see Stu, wearing only his \"I    ROGER\" g-string and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony dancers. He is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the greased young studs. The guys look away, oooo. \nSTU I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym as much as I'd like... \nROGER You even taught us The Pony, which we'd never even heard of before... ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly gestures for the dancers to take turns \"riding\" him. Stu's face drops. \nROGER (CONT'D) And then, of course, the pi\u00e8ce de resistance: the Ride of the Valkyries. ON THE VIDEO Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride a LAVENDER MECHANICAL BULL together. The crowd goes wild. \nSTU Annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain. \nROGER After the show, we split a couple pitchers of flirtinis, you had our stylist cut your hair like mine, and then you split. \nVICK And what time was all this? \nROGER 4:30 in the morning? 4:45? \nALAN And our Doug was with us? \nROGER Yeah, he had passed out by then, but you carried him out. It was all very Officer And A Gentleman. The guys look at each other, confused. \nALAN Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45, we got back to the hotel at 5:00, and Doug was gone by 5:30 when Chastity met back up with us? \nSTU That doesn't make any sense. \nVICK Did we lose him along the way? \nSTU He was passed out, how far could he have gone--? Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads \"MANDALAY BAY.\" He answers: \nVICK Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nSTU (CONT'D) Were any of your deals...real? \nVICK \n(GUILTY) Some. Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned... \nSTU Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that money meant something to me... Vick spins around, furious: \nVICK Do you really think I wanted my life to turn out like this, Stu?! Do you really think I don't know that I'm a massive loser?! \n(MORE) \nVICK (CONT'D) Jesus, you guys got out of high school and you just knew what to do, you went to college and got good jobs and found cool wives and made beautiful children -- what do I have to show for the last decade of my life?! Nothing! Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES against the wall! The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional. \nVICK (CONT'D) Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only thing I really have...the only thing I really have is you guys. \nSTU Come on, Vick-- \nVICK No, man, it's true! I put on a good show, but my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely, it scares me, man. I-I don't know how much longer I can keep this scam going. And now I've gone and ruined the one good thing I had... Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry. \nVICK (CONT'D) Just...please don't give up on me, okay? I-I don't know what I'd do without you guys. I really don't... Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky Vick this vulnerable before. Stu can't help but give in. \nSTU Come on, man, we've been bro's since third grade, it's gonna take a lot more than money to ruin our friendship. Vick looks down, deeply touched... \nSTU (CONT'D) What I don't understand is why you didn't just ask me for the money. I would've given you every last cent I had, man... \nTears trail down Vick's cheeks. He crosses and gives Stu a hug. Stu hugs back, emotional. \nSTU (CONT'D) I love you, man. \nVICK Love you too, bro. Love you too. They hug tight. For a while. \nSTU Also, I banged your sister sophomore year. Vick pulls away. \nVICK What?! \nSTU Sorry. Just seemed like a good time to tell you. Vick stammers at Stu, speechless. \nSTU (CONT'D) She had just broken up with that guy from Central, we were playing \"I Never\" at Tim Donahee's pool, one thing lead to another-- \nVICK No! No. That's...that's plenty. Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan just frowns at his watch, stressed. \nALAN Look, I'm glad we're all sharing, but we've got three hours to come up with 200 grand, or else... The guys nod, frowning, back on point. \nALAN (CONT'D) I'd offer to take a loan out, but it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm pretty sure my bank is closed. \nSTU I think I can get a 20 grand cash advance on my credit card... \nALAN So that just leaves 180 grand... The guys frown at each other. \nCHASTITY Well, it is Vegas... The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think...? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nALAN THROWING DOWN BLACKJACK AT A BLACKJACK TABLE The guys erupt in CHEERS around him, YAAA! The dealer slides over a large pile of CHIPS. \nCUT TO: \nCHASTITY THROWING CRAPS AT A CRAPS TABLE Again the guys erupt! Alan hugs Chastity. Their pile of CHIPS grows... \nCUT TO: \nSTU YELLING \"BINGO\" AT A BINGO TABLE The guys jump up, slapping ten, YELLING! Stu points at a table full of OLD LADIES nearby: in your face! \nCUT TO: \nALAN, STU, VICK AND CHASTITY SITTING AT A PAI GOW TABLE looking lost. Then they take their large stack of chips and quietly leave. No one knows how to play Pai Gow poker. \nVick's car races down a dark, abandoned desert highway. The guys look tired, stressed, and most of all, scared. \nALAN Yep, just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters, what could possibly go wrong...? The guys all frown. \nSTU So what's our plan? \nALAN I think we should tell Mr. Lang that we couldn't get the money, but that, if he's amenable, we could create a payment calendar-- \nVICK We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag of money, grab Doug, and make a run for it. \nALAN Yes, good! What an airtight plan--! \nVICK Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is our only shot of getting Doug back! Left turn! Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road. Things are quickly going from bad to worse... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE FIRST RAYS OF DAWN streaking across Venice Beach. \nTITLE CARD: \"SUNDAY, 6:04AM\" \nINT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- MORNING \nTracy exits her bedroom in her jammies, looking like she barely slept. Her father is up, and making breakfast. \nTRACY Any word from Doug? \nMR. TURNER Nope. \n(BEAT) I know you don't want to hear it, Trace, but you deserve better. Tracy frowns, overwhelmed with stress. \nTRACY I'm sure everything's fine. They're all smart, capable adults... \nCUT TO: \nVICK DELICATELY LAYING CASH INSIDE HIS DUFFEL BAG on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create the appearance of a bag full of money. He's using some $20 bills, but also some $5's and $1's. \nVICK This all the cash we got? The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We are \nINT. VICK'S CAR/EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAWN \nThe Caddy is parked next to MILE MARKER 26 in the middle of the windy desert. The Las Vegas skyline is just barely visible in the distance. Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to disturb the bills, and places it on his lap. \nALAN This is the dumbest plan ever. \nVICK Alan I need you positive please. \nSTU Here they come. They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up. \nVICK Stuart? \nSTU Yeah? \nVICK There's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box. Get it out please. Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks. They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer. \nALAN I can't believe this is how we're going to die... The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves. The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open... TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road... \nTIGHT ON Vick's LEATHER SHOE, then Alan's SAILING TOPSIDER, then Stu's FLIP-FLOP, as they all hit the dusty road... The two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off. Somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake RATTLES. \nJIMMY LANG Let's see the money! Vick gently holds up his duffel bag. \nVICK Let's see Doug! Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit. The guys look a bit alarmed. \nALAN Jesus, what'd they do to him? \nVICK Pull off the Ralph's bag! Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal \nIT'S NOT DOUG It's some black dude. Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused. \nSTU I can't believe you just saved my life! \nVICK I can't believe you just drove my car into Jimmy Lang! Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers. \nSTU He's gonna be really upset! \nALAN Yeah, I was just thinking that! \nBACK ON JIMMY LANG The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor. His two henchmen waddle up, highly concerned. \nKIKIOLANI Boss, Boss, you okay?! Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious. \nJIMMY LANG Find Vick... And kill him. \nINT. VICK'S CAR -- DAWN \nThe guys race down the dusty highway in traumatized silence. \nALAN Now can we call Tracy? \nVick frowns and blots his split lip with his sleeve. \nVICK Yeah. It's probably time. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- LONE PAYPHONE -- DAWN \nThe guys pull up at a lone, dusty payphone in the middle of the desert. They all look at the phone. \nALAN Who wants to make the call? Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close. \nSTU That was you! \nALAN What?! No! I beat you by a mile! \nSTU Vick, who won?! \nVICK \n(FROWNING) Actually...I should do it. This weekend was mostly my fault. I need to Man Up. Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound sense of responsibility. \nALAN Well, I'll be damned... Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat. \nVICK I still can't believe Stu banged my sister. Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the pay phone... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY \nTracy is putting on her makeup in the bridal suite. Her stern dad blows in. \nMR. TURNER Any word from Doug? The way he spits out \"Doug\" tells us all we need to know about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law. \nTRACY No, but I'm sure he's-- Just then, Tracy's CELL PHONE rings. She quickly answers it. \nTRACY (CONT'D) Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nVICK In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted aviators into the rising sun. \nVICK Tracy, it's Vick. \nTRACY Hey Vick! \nVICK Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug. \nSTU \nCAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE \nDOUG IS?! \nVICK He's on the roof! Stu looks confused, the roof? \nALAN After Doug passed out, we must've taken him up there in his bed as a prank, so he'd wake up on the roof or whatever? Then we forgot him. \nVICK And all day he's been throwing his crap off the roof, trying to signal someone to get him down! \nSTU You think he's still up there?! \nALAN Only one way to find out... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. MANDALAY BAY -- DAY \nThe guys peel up to the valet and sprint out of the car. \nINT. MANDALAY BAY -- LOBBY -- DAY \nThe guys race through the lobby at top speed. \nEXT. MANDALAY BAY -- ROOFTOP -- DAY \nThe guys burst out of the steel door, onto the massive black tar roof. It's empty. \nALAN \nDOUG?! DOUG?! \nVICK \nWHERE ARE YOU, MAN?! But Doug is nowhere to be seen. The guys start to despair... Then...stepping out from behind an air-conditioning vent, naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body bright pink from sunburn... \nIS DOUG! And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed! \nALAN \nDOUG! \nSTU Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay! \nBefore they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and whispers, nasty, parched: \nDOUG Don't...even...talk to me. The guys stop short. \nVICK Okay, no, that's cool! \nSTU Yeah, you have every right to be upset! We validate your anger! \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"SUNDAY, 7:05AM\" \nEXT. MANDALAY BAY/INT. VICK'S CAR -- MORNING \nThe guys gingerly rush Doug, now in a Mandalay Bay bathrobe and clutching an arm-full of BOTTLED WATERS, through the hotel lobby. Alan is arguing into his cellphone. As they pass ATASHIR at his desk, Vick yells over: \nVICK Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?! Why did you betray us?! \nATASHIR Because they paid me. And also because you're kind of racist. \nVICK Fair enough! See you next time, you beautiful Judas! They blow out of the hotel... \n", "test1_input": "THE FRONT DESK A perfectly pressed LEBANESE MAN waits behind the front desk. Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still on. \nFRONT DESK MAN Welcome to the Mandalay Bay. \nVICK Checking in. Lennon comma Victor. The man types into his computer. \nFRONT DESK MAN Yes, we have you down for a one night stay in an economy suite-- Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads \"ATASHIR.\" \nVICK Hold it right there, Atashir. This is my best friend from childhood, Douglas Billings. In two days, he is to marry a woman of great beauty and strong teeth, do you understand? A woman of gigantic bosoms who will give him many, many sons... Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed. \nVICK (CONT'D) My two other childhood friends have travelled great distances, across many deserts, to be here. This isn't a night in a hotel for us, Atashir: this is a family reunion. Perhaps you too have family situated great distances away, in a foreign country with much sand? Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter and touches his arm, simpatico. \nVICK (CONT'D) Then I have but one question for you, friend: if they came to town, would you put them in an economy suite? \nATASHIR No, sir. \nVICK Well, then. I think one of us needs to get back on his little computer and find us a suitable room. Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer. \nATASHIR All the deluxe rooms are taken. The Dean Martin suite is available, but I'd have to ask my-- \nVICK Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case of Cristal, two bottles of Patron, four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of skinless mangos... Vick turns to the guys: \nVICK (CONT'D) You guys want anything? The guys stammer, too stunned to speak. \nVICK (CONT'D) And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen of those duck skewers I like so well. He knows the ones. \nATASHIR And how would you like to pay? \nVICK American Express. Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns to Alan: \nVICK (CONT'D) Dude, give him your AmEx. \nALAN What? \nVICK Don't worry, we'll hit you later. Alan stammers. \nVICK (CONT'D) Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop being such a Jew. Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT \nThe guys enter the room, jostling; Stu has Doug in a headlock. Then they freeze: the Dean Martin Suite is massive, complete with lounge area, two flat screen TVs, full bar and multiple bedrooms. The guys just gape. \nSTU This is bigger than my house. Vick blows past them, totally unfazed. \nVICK Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels up in ten. Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite. \nALAN I am so not getting paid back. \nINT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nVick enters the bedroom, drops his bag, and starts changing his shirt -- when his cell phone RINGS. He answers. \nVICK This is Vick. \nVick listens -- then grows a bit panicked: \nVICK (CONT'D) He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me! \n(WINCING) All right, I'll get it. All right. All right--! When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone, trying to keep the call confidential: \nVICK (CONT'D) I said all right, dude! How many more times you want me to say all right?! \n(BEAT) All right. All right. Vick hangs up, looking uncharacteristically stressed... \nINT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- BATHROOM -- SAME \n", "test1_true": "ALAN So, you ready for Sunday? \nDOUG Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but I'm actually just really psyched. Alan nods, impressed. \nALAN Tracy's dad still hate you? \nDOUG Oh yeah. \nALAN Any closer to figuring out why? \nDOUG Enh, I think he wanted more for his girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who makes 45 grand a year, and he's a titan of industry who makes 45 grand a day, you know? I sort of get it... (beat, brushing teeth) Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm not sure you ever get past that. \nAlan smiles, yeah, there's that. Doug spits out his paste. \nDOUG (CONT'D) You got floss? Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up, starts looking for the floss. Then Alan remembers something -- but it's too late. Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING. \nDOUG (CONT'D) Holy Christ! Alan quickly reaches for the ring-- \nALAN Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell anyone about that-- Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable. \nSTU Anyone got any nipple lube--? (seeing ring) Jesus would you look at the size of that thing?! Stu grabs the ring from Doug. \nDOUG It's Alan's. For Becky. \nSTU Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy? \nALAN (clutching for ring) Actually, I-I was trying to keep it a secret, so-- Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate: \nVICK Boy Party in the bathrooooom--! (sees ring, snags it) Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight pink tint, street value: 26, 27K. Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples. \nSTU Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's finally going to propose! \nVICK Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good for you! Where'd you get the ring? \nALAN Oh, it's a family heirloom. My grandmother smuggled it through the Holocaust, actually. I was going to propose to Beck this weekend. Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him. \nDOUG Well: now we have two things to celebrate! \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"FRIDAY, 6:10 PM\" \nEXT. MANDALAY BAY ROOFTOP -- NIGHT \nThe guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses. Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the door and the frame so they aren't locked up here. The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the stunning panorama...the Strip...the mountains...the countless stars... It's breathtaking. \nSTU Thish is so great! I love you guys! \nVICK Check it out, Stu's already wasted. Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses. \nALAN We've only had two shots, man! \nDOUG Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You used to be able to drink us all under the table! \nSTU Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time to get plastered anymore! It blows! \n(QUICKLY) Am I a bad dad for saying that? \nDOUG What? No! \nSTU Because my dad was a bad dad. \nDOUG (patting his shoulder) That's true, Stuey, but you're different. We've talked about this. Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat. \nSTU Have I showed you guys pictures of my kids yet--? \n", "test1_id": 513, "test2_input": "ALAN Oh yeah? \nCHASTITY Yeah. I work here on the weekends. \nALAN You fly out every week? \nCHASTITY Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a great school. \nALAN Kid? \nVICK (aside, to Stu) They always have kids. \nCHASTITY I have a little girl, Sarah. She's... Well, she's everything. Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute little toddler. Alan smiles. \nCHASTITY (CONT'D) What about you? \nALAN No kids. Same girlfriend for 14 years. Becky. Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone. \nCHASTITY Wow, she's stunning. Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer: \nSTU We like you way better. \nALAN \nSTU! Chastity tries to stymie her laugh. \nALAN (CONT'D) Becky is great. \nSTU Becky collects teapots. \nVICK Yeah, she's a total canwego. \nCHASTITY A what? \nVICK You know, she's the girl at the party who's always like \"Can we go? Can we go?\" Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head. \nALAN She has low blood sugar. \nSTU She has low fun sugar. \nALAN Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm going to marry! (beat, considers) If, you know...she forgives me for cheating on her... \nVICK Wait: you're going to tell her? \nALAN Of course I'm going to tell her! I could never keep something like that from her. \nVICK Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me for scratching her Queensryche CD in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever gonna forgive you for marrying a stripper in Vegas. \nALAN Well, then that's just the price I'm going to have to pay. Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud. \nCHASTITY Good for you. She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her face. Alan looks at her anew... It's a sweet moment... \nVICK She's gonna cut your dick off, dude. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT \nLamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet stand. Vick rolls up in his clunker. The guys hop out. \nVICK (to the valet) Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be right back. \nINT. MANDALAY BAY -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nChastity and the guys hurry down the hallway to their suite. Vick unlocks their door and pushes inside. \nVICK Doug! Wake up, man! \n", "test2_true": "Instead of finding Doug, however, they find KALOLO FANALUA, sitting on their couch, pissed. He's got a huge WHITE CAST on his right arm, courtesy of the strip club bouncers. \nKALOLO FANALUA Aloha, assholes. The guys freeze. \nSTU Uh-oh. The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see KIKIOLANI standing in front of the door, blocking their exit. He has an identical CAST on his right arm. \nSTU (CONT'D) Not good. Just then, a toilet FLUSHES and an immensely large man in a red suit exits the bathroom, drying his hands. We recognize him from his police photo as crime boss JIMMY LANG, 50's. \nJIMMY LANG Oh, hello. Good to see you again. \nVICK Where is Doug? \nALAN Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did last night, we are incredibly sorry- \nJIMMY LANG These your rich friends you were telling me about, Vick? Alan and Stu glance at Vick, confused. \nJIMMY LANG (CONT'D) Oh, you haven't told them yet? Really, that's low. Even for you. \nALAN What's going on, Vick? Vick stammers, trying to find the words... \nJIMMY LANG Six months ago, your friend Vick borrowed some money from me at what can only be described as a very unfavorable interest rate. When the loan came due, he failed to pay me back, but he promised me that he could get the money from you guys this weekend. Alan and Stu look at Vick, shocked and hurt. \nALAN Jesus, Vick... \nSTU How could you do this to us, man? We're your best friends... Vick looks away, ashamed. \nVICK They were gonna hurt me, man... \nJIMMY LANG Well, Vick, it looks like you and your friends have some issues to discuss. In the meantime... He draws a huge, red-plated .357 MAGNUM. \nJIMMY LANG (CONT'D) I need my goddamn money. The guys jump back, whoa! Vick holds up his hands: \nVICK I can get it! I can! I just-- \nJIMMY LANG I've heard that before, Vick, including last night, when you so rudely skipped out on my birthday party. That's why I've taken some collateral to ensure your payment. His name is Doug. The guys all look sick. \nVICK You have Doug? \nSTU Oh my God... \nJIMMY LANG If you want your friend to live, meet me at mile marker 26 off Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the money. Are we clear? \nVICK Yes! Yes. Jimmy nods and heads for the door. The Samoans follow him. \nALAN M-M-Mr. Lang? \nJIMMY LANG Yes, Mr. Mervish? \nALAN H-How much does Vick owe? \nCUT TO: \nALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) 200 thousand dollars?! \nINT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER \nAlan and Stu pace about the suite, beyond stressed. Vick stands, looking out the window. Chastity gets them all water. \nALAN How the hell could you blow that kind of money?! \nSTU Was it for the custard store? \nALAN Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no custard store! Vick was just trying to rip us off to pay back Jimmy Lang! \nSTU Is that true, Vick? Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it. \n", "test2_id": 514, "test3_input": "TITLE CARD: \"SUNDAY, 10:19AM\" \nINT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY \nTracy paces in the bridal suite. Then Mr. Turner enters. \nMR. TURNER I'm sorry, honey, but I think you need to seriously consider that Doug might not be coming... Tracy stops short, speechless. \nMR. TURNER (CONT'D) Some men just aren't cut out for this kind of commitment. I'm so sorry that this is how you had to find out-- Just then, we hear a car SQUEALING UP outside... \nINT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB \nThe Bridesmaids sit around the posh lobby, waiting, anxious. Just then, the doors blow open and \nVICK, ALAN, STU, AND DOUG stride inside! Their tuxes are wrinkled, their hair is a mess, and the groom is bright pink -- but they're here. \nVICK Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy route. We ready to do this thing? The bridesmaids sit up, stunned. \nCUT TO: \nTRACY AND HER FATHER walking down the aisle, arm-in-arm, as Mozart plays. Tracy looks tentative. Her father frowns, not at all happy... \nIN THE AUDIENCE Everyone smiles, AHHS, and snaps photos... \nAT THE ALTAR The groomsmen smile as well. Vick whispers to Doug: \nVICK She looks beautiful, man. \nDoug still doesn't speak to him. \nVICK (CONT'D) That's cool. I get it. \nTRACY reaches the altar, then turns to her dad. His face is a mess of emotions. They hug. \nTRACY I love you, Daddy. \nMR. TURNER I love you too, pumpkin. Tracy's Dad shoots Doug a nasty look before taking his seat in the first row. Then Tracy approaches Doug at the altar, and whispers to him, angry, hurt: \nTRACY Where were you? And why are you pink? \nDOUG It's a long story. All I can say is I'm so sorry. And I promise, for as long as we're married, I will never ever put you through something like this again. (desperate, pleading) Can... Can you forgive me? Tracy studies his face, searching... All the guests wait with bated breath... The groomsmen wince, come on come on come on... Then, unable to be mad at Doug, Tracy smiles and kisses him. He kisses her back. The guests all SIGH in relief. The groomsmen exhale, whew. Vick and Alan covertly knock fists. The Minister clears his throat. \nMINISTER We, um, we traditionally wait til the end for the kiss...? But Doug and Tracy just keep on kissing... \nMATCH DISSOLVE TO: \nDOUG AND TRACY STILL KISSING at the reception. The entire wedding party is applauding. \nCHAMPAGNE IS UNCORKED and the WEDDING BAND kicks in. We are now down on the lawn, where white tables and a dance floor have been set up. \nSTANDING IN THE BACK OF THE RECEPTION Vick, Stu, and Alan aggressively APPLAUD and WHISTLE for the bride and the groom. \nVICK We did it, fellahs. We pulled it off. \nALAN I never had a doubt. They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen him. They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their first dance on the dance floor. \nSTU You think Doug's ever going to talk to us again? \nVICK Give him time. \nALAN Yeah. Like a decade or two-- Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder. \nSTU Uh-oh. The guys all look over to see \nBECKY Alan's girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down on them, irate. \nVICK Hey Beck--! \n", "test3_true": "Alan shrinks down, back to being the chastised boyfriend. \nALAN I-I'm so sorry, I can explain-- Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Alan? They all turn to see \nCHASTITY standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her hair back. She cleans up nicely. Alan swallows, whoa. \nVICK This just got complicated... \nALAN Jennifer? Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name. \nCHASTITY I-I know I wasn't invited, but I just had to return this... She hands Alan his GRANDMOTHER'S HOLOCAUST RING. Becky watches on, stunned. \nBECKY Okay: who the hell is this chick, and why the hell does she have your Grandmother's wedding ring?! Alan looks back and forth between Becky and Chastity... It's the moment of truth. The fork in life's road... \nBECKY (CONT'D) Talk, you moron! Jesus, you're just like your mother! Talk! Who's the ho wearing my ring?! And in that moment, it all becomes so clear. Alan turns: \nALAN She's my wife. Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick grin, oh shit! \nALAN (CONT'D) We don't make each other happy anymore, Beck. And we can keep not making each other happy for another 14 years -- hell, maybe even another 50 years -- but let's not. Let's find people who make our hearts race. Let's be excited and fun and alive again... Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat. \nBECKY Are you fucking kidding me? Alan shakes his head, sadly, no. \nALAN I'm sorry, Beck. I really am. (to Chastity) Can I buy you a free drink? Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together towards the bar. \nCHASTITY We're not...actually...still married, are we? \nALAN Let's start with dinner, and see where it goes...? \nCHASTITY (smiling warmly) I'd like that. \nBACK ON BECKY She finally recovers enough to speak: \nBECKY Alan! Alan Steven Mervish, get back here this second! (but Alan keeps walking) Don't you walk away from me, you stupid little clown! I own you! GET \nBACK HERE IMMEDIATELY! But Alan just keeps walking away with Chastity. Vick and Stu wave him on, go dude! Go! Then Becky turns on them. Beat. They both scatter, terrified. \nSTAY WITH STU as he hurries off through the crowd. After a moment, he \nHEARS: \nVOICE Daddy?! Stu turns to see his TWO ANGELIC DAUGHTERS in sundresses racing through the crowd towards him! They leap into his arms, so excited to see him! He scoops them both up. \nSTU Oh, I missed you guys so much! \nHAYLEE We missed you too, daddy! \nKAITLIN You're the best dad ever! Beat. And then Stu just starts BAWLING. Tears everywhere. His lovely wife ERIN appears, harried, a diaper bag over her shoulder, and sees him crying. She rolls her eyes. \nERIN Jesus, are you still drunk? Stu shakes his head, no, and keeps SOBBING as he pulls her into a big family hug... \nINT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- LATER \nVick, a cocktail in hand, his tie undone, heads into the men's room and approaches a urinal. Then KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA walk in behind him, still in their huge arm casts, still very pissed. Vick inhales, scared. \nVICK Okay, okay, I'll go with you. Just...don't ruin the wedding. Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES. \nJIMMY LANG I really didn't want it to end like this, Vick. Vick nods, resigned, and starts towards him. Then Jimmy extends his hand for Vick to shake. \nJIMMY LANG (CONT'D) Good luck. \nVICK (totally thrown) Um, what...? \nJIMMY LANG Your friend Alan just paid your marker. Took out a second mortgage on his house. The full 200 grand, plus medical expenses, which I thought was a classy touch. Vick looks blown away. \n", "test3_id": 515}

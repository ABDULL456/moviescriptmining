{"train": "FLIGHT \nWritten by \nJohn Gatins \nDec. 12, 2011 \nCHYRON -- ATLANTA 6:12 AM \nEXT. SOMEWHAT SEEDY TWO-STORY HOTEL IN ATLANTA -- PRE-DAWN \nIt's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only source of light as we hear a metallic rattle. \nEXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWN \nWe follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops and we watch the knob slowly turn. \nTight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces \"hope.\" We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the pulling of what looks like a large suitcase. \nNICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior 2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation. \nShe digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing. \nShe now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks better of it and hangs up. \nEXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER \nNICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988 Toyota Tercel and slams it shut. \nINT. 1988 TOYOTA TERCEL -- PARKING LOT -- SAME TIME \nWe hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on \"speaker phone\" mode. The phone rests on the passenger seat. We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on the steering wheel. She is exhausted and irritated... \nNICOLE (as the phone rings) Don't pick up...don't pick up... don't pick up... \nA MAN answers with music in the background...\"Yo..\" NICOLE quickly picks up the phone. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) It's Nic, do you have any? Good morning to you too. You're what? Well, where are you guys shooting today? Where? Text me the address. You have some...Okay. \nShe hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview she tries to smile. \nCHYRON -- ORLANDO 7:14 AM \nEXT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING \nThe sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey clouds. We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture. \nINT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING \nThrough the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter... \nAn attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a cell phone starts ringing. \nBack to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his 40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP snatches up his phone and answers... \nVOICE For the love of Christ! Look...just hold...HOLD ON. \nHe aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the hotel ice bucket. \nThe naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes. \nWe witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect crack down the middle. Whip smiles, taking it all in... \nWHIP (into the phone) I've been up since the crack 'a dawn. What check? Tuition? How much does it cost to go there? \nThe YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands. \nThe YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second, hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone. \nWHIP (CONT'D) NO! NO! NO! You decided he needed private school...lemme talk to Knuckles. He's not? Tell'em the phone works both ways. Oh he's my son because you need a tuition check...that's great Deana. I'm glad you tracked me down in Orlando at 7 in the fucking morning to shake me down for money. Does he even like the fucking school? No I've never seen it. Yeah I wonder why not too. I gotta 9 o'clock flight, sit tight 'till I get back to Atlanta. How am I a liar? What? No, I'll call you. \nWHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window. \nYOUNG WOMAN Was that your wife? \nWHIP That was my ex-wife. But you Trina, you could be my second or third wife if you'd just C'mere. \nThe YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively... \nTRINA Whip, don't even joke about that. Our flight's at 9, let's hit it. \nTRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away. \nON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock anthem...JOE COCKER's \"I'm Feeling Alright\" \nWHIP Yeah, I'm feelin' a little light- headed. I shoulda ate somethin'. \nWHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke. \nINT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES HOTEL-ORLANDO-HALLWAY-MORNING \nWHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides confidently down the hallway. JOE COCKER continues to wail, perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper. \nEXT. AIRPORT SOUTHJET TARMAC - AIRPLANE - MORNING RAINING \nWHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-RIDGEFIELD 88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the tarmac. WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in to a puddle. \nWHIP Son of a bitch! \nWhip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the stairs. \nThe plane rocks and shutters. WHIP seems oblivious as he continues to serenade Evans. \nWHIP (SINGING) Feelin' alright - Not feelin' too good myself - Feelin' alright - Not feelin' too good myself... \nWHIP is interrupted by Air Traffic Control. \nATC (ON RADIO) SouthJet 227...Be advised there is a large convective cell four miles at your 11 o'clock. And another cell, 2 o'clock, 10 miles. Both moving rapidly. \nEVANS Copy, Center. (TO WHIP) Did you get that? \nWHIP Gottit Skippy. I'm just tryin' to get birdie here outta this wind bowl...What did they clear us to? \nEVANS We're cleared to Flight Level one- eight-thousand. \nTHE PLANE TAKES ANOTHER VIOLENT DIP \nEVANS' headset flies off. His tie and all the loose equipment and coffee cups are thrown to the ground. \nWHIP Goddamnit! Enough of this shit! \nWHIP pushes the yoke forward. The plane pitches downward. \nEVANS What are you doing!? \nWHIP Leveling off. \nEVANS What!? \nWHIP points to the MFD screen. \nWHIP See that sliver of blue sitting between those two ugly bastards? \nC.U. MFD screen: A narrow line of blue is visible between the two monstrous convective cells. \nWHIP (CONT'D) That's a little pocket of smooth air squatting right over Lake Kissimmee... \nEVANS nervously squints at the screen. \nWHIP (CONT'D) And we're gonna thread that fucking needle. Turn me thirty degrees right! \nEVANS jumps on the radio. \nEVANS (into his mic) Center. This is SouthJet 227, We need to divert 30 degrees right... \nWHIP For weather. \nEVANS (into his mic) ...for weather. \nATC SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville Center. 30 Degrees, right, approved. Report back on course. \nEVANS Report back on course. \nWHIP banks the plane to the right. \nSuddenly -- the plane falls 200 feet in 2 seconds. \nA huge air pocket pulls the rug out from under the JR-88. From the cockpit we can hear the passengers scream. EVANS holds on to his headset. \nEVANS (CONT'D) Oh, Lord! \nWHIP He can't help you now, brother. \nWHIP remains cool as he rides more bad air. The plane now bounces rapidly over a non-stop succession of speed bumps. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY \nThe passengers clutch each other as they rattle like bobble head dolls; it's getting worse. \nINT. COCKPIT - DAY \nWHIP pushes the throttle and the 17-year-old Jackson- Ridgefield JR-88 accelerates directly into a huge black cloud. He begins to dip the nose level to the ground. \nEVANS Why are you leveling off, sir? \nWHIP I'd like to spend less time in this shitty air, Kenny. Is that alright with you? \nWHIP pushes the 17-year-old Jackson-Ridgefield JR-88 directly into a huge black cloud. He begins to dip the nose towards the ground. \nEVANS We're approaching maximum airspeed! \nWHIP Fucking right! I'm gonna need some speed to punch through this crap. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY \nThe passengers howl in fear as the plane pitches forward. \nINT. COCKPIT - DAY \nEVANS calls out to WHIP... \nEVANS You're over-speeding! \nWHIP Not yet!! \nThe AIRSPEED INDICATOR moves from GREEN right up to the YELLOW line. \nWHIP banks the plane steeply to the right. From the cabin we HEAR the passengers SCREAM! \nNow ATC comes on the radio... \nATC (ON RADIO) Uh, SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville Center. Say altitude. \nNICOLE kicks the door shut and locks it, escaping FRAN who calls through the door. \nFRAN (O.S.) Tricky tricky, girl. Alright, so you shower up and come down. For real. We don't gotta talk about the check. Hang out a lil bit... \nNICOLE puts her camera down gently on the table. \nNICOLE (SOTTO) In your fucking dreams. \nShe now flings her purse on the ground in frustration...the contents spill on to the carpet. Amidst the flotsam we focus on yet another candy tin that springs open. NICOLE fixes her stare at the hypodermic needle resting inside. \nINT. CABIN - GALLEY - DAY \nWHIP exits the lavatory drying his hands with a towel. He looks down the aisle to see TRINA far down the cabin. TRINA sees WHIP, comes back up the aisle and stands with her back to him watching the passengers. \nWHIP opens a bottle of orange juice and takes a big swig. He then pours half of it in the sink. WHIP places the open juice bottle on the liquor cart, reaches up, and grabs the cabin mic to address the passengers. \nWHIP Folks, this is Captain Whitaker. If you look up, I'm here in the galley. I will wave to you. \nWHIP steps into the aisle so the passengers can see him. WHIP waves with a calm smile that would put anyone at ease. \nWHIP (CONT'D) Good Morning. I apologize for the bumps, but Florida just doesn't seem to like us Georgians. Must be the beatin' the Bulldogs put on the Gators last fall. \nTitters of laughter from the passengers as WHIP moves the half step he needs to put himself behind the liquor cart. \nWHIP (CONT'D) Stretch out and relax. The air might stay a little cranky so I'm gonna ask that you sit tight if you can, with your seat belts fastened. \nWe now watch from behind WHIP as his free hand reaches into the top drawer of the liquor cart and pulls three small vodka bottles out. \nWHIP (CONT'D) We won't have beverage service but the girls will walk through with water and snacks and I'll have you in Atlanta in about 40 minutes. Thank you. \nWHIP puts the mic to its hook. Alone in the galley and out of view, he quickly empties the vodkas into the orange juice bottle and replaces the cap. Whip shakes the juice as he tosses the little empties into the galley trash. Whip takes a healthy pull from the spiked juice, downing nearly half. \nWHIP knocks on the cockpit door. MARGARET emerges and WHIP disappears in to the cockpit. \nINT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT -- ATLANTA -- DAY \nFramed photos on a bureau show: Christmas around the tree with Mom (30) and Dad (33) and a girl who's 8 and a boy who's 5. (In the reflection of this photo we see a flame cooking heroin in a spoon.) \nAnother photo depicts an 8 year-old girl's birthday party. (In the reflection of this photo see wee Nicole tying off.) \nA last photo shows NICOLE (30)and her mom (54). They are both wearing kerchiefs. We can see that her mom is gaunt and has no hair under her kerchief. (In the reflection of this photo we see the needle injected into her arm.) \nA HYPODERMIC NEEDLE is placed in front of that picture. Next to the photos is a small CD station that NICOLE taps to life and turns up. The opening bars of Michael Fitzpatrick's \"Medication\" begin to play. \nWe pull wide to see NICOLE pull the bra from her arm that she used to tie off with. Her face is pure happiness. \nClothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table. NICOLE picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down. \nShe picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and reaches for the lighter. She laughs and hums, pulls out gum, a brush...She's holding the brush when the first heavy wave of narcotic death washes over her. She leans back and uses the wall for support. \"Medication\" is hitting its chorus... \nNICOLE Oh man... \nShe puts her arms out at her sides, euphoria. A slow, sloppy smile breaks across her face. She exhales slowly. She reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of heavy drugs hits. NICOLE looks up with fear. \nNICOLE (cont'd) (CONT'D) Oh no, oh no, oh no... \nShe reaches for the little bag of coke that KIP gave her. Next she grabs her phone, flipping it open. As she tries to dial it, she crumbles to her knees. NICOLE somewhat controls her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading. The little bag of coke falls from her fingers. \nThere's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose. NICOLE's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks to the floor. On her back like a girl making angels in the snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away. \nWe hear a pounding on the door. FRAN is on the other side... \nFRAN (O.S.) Open up, Nicole! I can smell that shit cooking! Open Up! Nicole. Nicole! \nINT. COCKPIT - DAY \nWHIP is now passed out in the seat next to EVANS. He has two approach plates (charts) folded and tucked between his sunglasses and eyes, creating a makeshift sleeping mask. His lower jaw hangs open as his head bobs in deep sleep. \nMargaret leans in through the cockpit door talking to Evans. \nMARGARET How long has Sleeping Beauty been out? \nEVANS maintains a military posture as he monitors the plane's progress. The flight is smooth and the sky appears clear. \nEVANS (looks at his watch) 26 minutes. We're going to start descending any second now. \nMARGARET Well, I guess you'll need to wake... \nThe radio interrupts... \nATC SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center. Descend and maintain Flight Level 30 thousand. \nEVANS Descend and maintain 30 thousand. \nEvans dials 30,000 into the auto-pilot, but just as he rolls the thumb switch to the \"Descend\" position... \nBANG! THE PLANE SUDDENLY PITCHES SIDEWAYS \nInstantly the autopilot's Shut-Off SOUNDS. \nWHIP jolts awake and pushes up his sleeping \"shades.\" \nWHIP The fuck was that? \nEvans grabs his yoke and pulls. \nEVANS The stabilizer feels really stiff. \nWHIP Don't force it. \nEVANS does, we HEAR a big mechanical SNAP. \nWHIP (KEYS MIC) 260...we'll do our best. (TO EVANS) It's getting away from me! I can't hold...dump the flaps! \nEVANS We're still fast. \nThe yoke is ripping away from Whip's hands. \nWHIP DO IT! 30 percent! \nEvans dumps in the flaps. The JR-88 slows dramatically and balloons up. \nWHIP (CONT'D) That bought us a little time. We need to revert to manual control. Your side first, pul... \nWhip is interrupted by the radio. \nATC (ON RADIO) SouthJet 227, Atlanta. Fuel dump is approved. \nWHIP (KEYS MIC) Thank you. \nEvans is confused and panicked, he throws his hands up. \nWHIP (CONT'D) Evans, look at me! Manual Reversion. Red lever, on the floor, far side of the console. \nEvans sees it. \nEVANS I got it. \nWHIP Pull it up, turn it clockwise, push it back down. \nEvans does exactly that, then pulls back on his yoke -- nothing! \nEVANS Nothing! No control! \nWHIP Goddamn it!! \nOnce again, the plane pitches into a dive. Whip strains to hold on. \nWHIP (CONT'D) I can't let go! Can you reach mine? \nEvans strains to reach Whip's Reversion Pull-Handle -- but can't. \nEVANS I can't reach it. \nEvans moves to release his harness, but Whip stops him. \nWHIP No! Don't! Stay strapped in! (calls over his shoulder) Margaret! Margaret! \nMargaret tumbles into the cockpit, catching herself on Whip's chair. She's crying. \nMARGARET Oh God, Whip. What's happening?! \nWHIP Get strapped into the jump-seat. I need your help. \nMargaret opens the jump-seat and starts to pull on her harness. Throughout the scene she is struggling with her harness. \nWHIP (CONT'D) Margaret, see that red lever on the floor next to my chair? The one that says, Manual Control? \nMARGARET Yes. \nWHIP On the count of three you pull it up, turn it clockwise, then push it back down. OK? You ready? \nWith tears streaming down her cheeks, she gives Whip a brave nod. \nWHIP (CONT'D) Here we go. One, two... \nWhip releases back pressure from his yoke, pushing it forward -- the plane noses downward 20 degrees! \nWHIP (CONT'D) ...three! \nMORE TERRIFIED SHRIEKS come from the back. Margaret quickly disengages then re-engages the large red handle. \nWhip pulls back on his yoke. The plane pitches up. \nWHIP (CONT'D) Ok. OK. We got something. It's still stiff as hell. Evans, put in some power! \nEvans pushes up the throttles. Whip gingerly applies pressure to his stick. His face fills with worry. \nWHIP (CONT'D) I don't know. It feels like the son of a bitch wants to nose over. \nThen suddenly... WHAP! Whip's yoke flies out of his hands and SLAMS forward! \nThe plane banks right and drops! Margaret SCREAMS! \nWHIP (CONT'D) SHIT! POWER BACK! (he pulls back the power) I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THIS! \nEVANS OH NO! \nNow, ATC comes on the radio... \nATC SouthJet 227, Hartsfield-Jackson is eleven o'clock and niner miles. I see you below 10,000. How are you doing? \nWHIP (keys his mic) Not good. You got anything closer? We're in a rapid dive here... \nATC Roger, SouthJet 227. Uh...Clayton County is 2 miles at your 4 o'clock. \nWHIP Negative. We're too high...we can't pitch for glide. We have no stabilizer control. \nATC Copy, SouthJet 227. \nThe plane continues to drop, increasing its nose-down attitude and speed. \nWHIP pushes both of his feet forward, stretching his body to get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke, trying to get the plane out of the dive it's in. \nATC Uh, SouthJet 227...say again sir. Did you say inverted? \nEVANS seems calmed by WHIP'S workaday attitude about their insane tragedy. But suddenly... \nWARNING LIGHTS BEGIN FLASHING! \nEVANS WE'RE LOSING OIL PRESSURE! PUMP FAILURE. BOTH ENGINES! \nWE HEAR A HORRIBLE, METALLIC GRINDING SOUND as the engines become oil-deprived. \nWHIP We're flying! \nWHOOP, WHOOP, WHOOP! -- THE ENGINE FIRE ALARM SOUNDS! \nEVANS FIRE IN THE LEFT ENGINE! \nWHIP PUT IT OUT! \nEvans pulls the Fire Bottle handle. \nWhip BARKS at air traffic control. \nWHIP (CONT'D) (into his mic) HOW FAR'S THE AIRPORT!? \nATC 227, three miles, and one o'clock. \nWHIP (into his mic) We're not gonna make that! \nWHIP'S POV -- THRU THE INVERTED WINDSCREEN -- \nA small white church on a hill -- 100 yards past the church is a soy bean field and a two-lane blacktop. \nWHIP (CONT'D) (into his mic) There's a field and a road ah...we're gonna put it down in that field. \nATC Roger, SouthJet 227. \nBACK TO ACTION -- CLOSE ON WHIP -- HE CALMLY FIGHTS ON. \nEVANS is breathing heavy as his face is beet red from the blood rushing to it. \nEVANS WE'RE LOSING THE LEFT ENGINE! \nWHIP WE'RE COMING BACK OVER! EVANS, WHEN I START THE ROLL, THROW EVERYTHING BACK OUT! \nTHE NERVE-WRACKING ALARMS CONTINUE TO SOUND! \nEVANS FIRE IN THE RIGHT! \nEvans deploys the right engine Fire Bottle. \nWHIP'S POV -- WE'RE HEADED TOWARD THE CHURCH -- \nWHIP (into his mic) WHAT'S MY ALTITUDE!? \nATC (ON RADIO) Eight hundred, descending... \nA NEW ALARM SCREAMS! \nEVANS WE LOST THE LEFT ENGINE! \nWHIP We have enough speed to fly! \nEVANS WE'RE LOSING POWER IN THE RIGHT! \nWHIP HERE WE GO! \nWHIP PULLS HARD ON HIS YOKE -- THE PLANE SLIPS SIDEWAYS AS IT STARTS TO RIGHT ITSELF. Whip yanks back the throttles! \nWHIP (CONT'D) FLAPS FULL! GEAR DOWN! \nEvans and Whip deploy every bit of drag they can think of. \nATC SouthJet 227, altitude 500 indicated, descending. Do you concur? \nWe follow WHIP's eye line that takes us off the control panel and to the windshield. \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD WE SEE -- the landscape and the church steeple getting closer and closer. \nThe plane does a clumsy roll to the right -- AND GETS STUCK PERFECTLY ON ITS SIDE! \nWHIP MARGARET, POWER!!!! \nEVANS pushes the power to full thrust AND THE PLANE FINISHES ITS ROLL! \nTHE PASSENGERS HOWL! \nINT. MAIN CABIN -- GALLEY -- SAME TIME \nTRINA is still struggling to strap herself in to her jumpseat. The plane rolls! She sees Camelia... \nP.O.V. -- Camelia is tossed across a row of SCREAMING passengers. \nTRINA loses her grip and is violently thrown against the galley wall! \nLike a rag doll, CAMELIA is hurled down the cabin aisle as the plane plummets! \nTrina slides across the galley floor and CRACKS her head on the jumpseat. \nINT. COCKPIT -- SAME TIME \nWhip frantically spins the trim wheel! \nWHIP's eyes open to see the halogen overhead lights of a hospital room. He turns his head slightly to see the flicker of a TV with no sound. \nTELEVISION -- NEWS - NO SOUND -- GRAINY CELL PHONE FOOTAGE \nA news show runs a loop of eye witness cell phone footage of the plane turning over and crashing belly down. \nA MAN who has been watching the TV turns to see that WHIP is awake. The MAN turns off the TV, gets up and approaches WHIP's bedside. WHIP knows him. \nWHIP Charlie Anderson. \nCHARLIE ANDERSON is a late 50's former military pilot who carries that familiar air of Texas comfort and entitlement. \nCHARLIE How you feelin' Whip? Initial reports look like you pulled some move up there, kid. You saved a lot of lives. \nWHIP is moved by the first realization of survival. \nWHIP How many? \nCHARLIE moves close to deliver the news. \nCHARLIE 102 souls on board including the flight crew, and 96 of them survived the crash. Six people died. 2 crew, 4 passengers. \nWHIP 4 passengers. Are the rest badly hurt? Who'd we lose on the crew? \nA NURSE enters the room. CHARLIE nods to her. \nCHARLIE Listen, protocol is the NTSB has to make the first contact with you and the agent is here. Let me go get him. \nCHARLIE ducks out of the room. WHIP is alone and still getting his bearings. He goes to scratch his head and catches sight of his left hand. It's swollen and sore --his wrist is bandaged with a splint-brace. He now looks at both of his hands in wonder. \nWHIP hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the images of MANY PEOPLE entering the room. A POLICE OFFICER accompanies a DOCTOR and TWO NTSB AGENTS. \nAn NTSB AGENT holds a small voice recorder towards WHIP. \nNTSB OFFICER #1 Captain William Whitaker? Nod if you can hear me and understand me. (WHIP NODS) I'm Craig Matson from the NTSB and I'm required as the lead on the Go Team to make an initial contact with you after a major incident like the one you had today. \nWHIP nods as his senses are getting sharper. \nNTSB OFFICER #1 (CONT'D) You are in a hospital in South Atlanta. Are you aware that you were piloting a plane that went down? (WHIP NODS) I have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation. \nWHIP offers a \"thumbs up\" gesture. The DOCTOR steps in. \nDOCTOR I'm Doctor Kenan and the good news is that you are in good condition. You did suffer a concussion which is the reason you have a bit of blurred vision and a headache. You have numerous lacerations around your left eye. We're going to leave the patch on for a few days as a precaution. But it seems your eye is OK. MRI's show strained tendons in your left knee and ankle but you didn't break any bones. \nYou have some deep bruising in your left thigh and you have a few torn ligaments in your left wrist. Nothing serious. So as soon as we clear you from the concussion, and you feel well enough -- you can go home. That could be a day, could be 3 days. Okay? \nWHIP quietly nods. The DOCTOR leaves and WHIP begins to study his body. His left leg is wrapped, his left wrist has a splint-brace -- \nNTSB OFFICER #1 I won't ask too much of you tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is required to make initial contact. How much do you remember about the flight? \nWHIP looks at the NTSB OFFICER and slowly speaks. \nWHIP I remember everything until the crash. \nWHIP's voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry. \nNTSB OFFICER #1 Okay Mr. Whitaker, that's fine. I am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life. (checks an index card) The most current information states that of the 102 souls on board we lost 6. 2 crew members and 4 passengers. 59 people were treated and released. 37 people remain in the hospital and 3 of those cases are listed as critical. \nWHIP Who on the crew died? \nNTSB OFFICER #1 Two flight attendants; (checks a note card) Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez \nWHIP tries to exhale as the loss of TRINA sinks in. \nNTSB OFFCIER #1 The rep from your Pilot's Union, Mr. Anderson, will act as our contact for you. It's important to follow your Union's guidance on press and media. The pilot's union works closely with the NTSB. So, I'm gonna head out. Good luck Mr. Whitaker. \nWHIP nods as the NTSB OFFICER leaves with the police and other officials in tow. CHARLIE returns to WHIP's side. \nWHIP I knew Trina Marquez. We spent some time together. \nCHARLIE Apparently she wasn't strapped in. A survivor reported that she was assisting a kid. \nCHARLIE tries to put a reassuring hand on WHIP's shoulder. \nWHIP How's Margaret Thomason? \nCHARLIE (checks his notes) Broken collar bone, cuts, banged up, but she's okay. She's here too. Ken Evans your copilot took a bad shot to the head. They're keepin' him in a coma to let the brain swelling go down. He's listed as critical, but we feel good about him. He's gonna be okay. \nWHIP lets that information land as his head is swirling. \nWHIP Charlie, why are you here? \nCHARLIE I'm flying a desk now. I'm a regional rep for the IAP. \nWHIP You're the rep for the pilots' union? \nCHARLIE I'm one of a few union reps for the southeast. When your plane went down all the reps got a page and since I know you I shot my hand up and said I wanted to come and be the first face you'd see. \nWHIP I'm glad it's you. \nWHIP starts to weep as he needs to begin the long process of expressing this trauma. \nCHARLIE It's good to see you too, Cowboy. You're gonna be okay. We're gonna take care of you. That's my job. \nWHIP nods as he wipes his eyes on his heavily bandaged hand. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) The union will put out a statement on your behalf. Condolences to the families who lost loved ones and gratitude to the brave men and women on the flight crew. (WHIP NODS) And I know you and Deana have been divorced for a while but maybe she and your son...? \nWHIP Yeah, Knuckles. \nCHARLIE Yeah, how old's he now? \nWHIP The meds they're giving me are fucking me up -- I'm all shaky and dried out. I can't sleep good. \nHARLING immediately picks up the small paper cup that holds WHIP's pain meds. He fishes out the two pills and stares at them. HARLING shakes his head. \nHARLING MAYS Aprazolam? That's generic Xanax and this Hydrocodone is generic Vicodin. It's shit, prolly Canadian. \nHARLING casually tosses the pills down his gullet and expertly swallows them without water. He grabs WHIP's medical chart and scours it as he prattles on... \nHARLING MAYS (CONT'D) We want the premium stuff. Blue label...not the fucking well shit. Where's the dihydromorphinone? \nOr just some fucking Palladone would suffice. What is this? Fucking amateur hour over here? Get that goddamned doctor in here. You just saved a 100 people from death, they should get your fuckin' meds right. (calls to the door) YO! ROOM SERVICE! \nWHIP Listen Harling, leave it alone. (HARLING CHILLS) So you got my message and decided not to call me back? Did you bring me smokes? \nHARLING MAYS I decided to come by instead. And yes I got your fucking message and yes I brought you smokes. \nHARLING hands WHIP a pack of smokes from his pocket. He also pulls out a carton of smokes from his backpack. \nHARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Here is a fresh carton, enjoy. You fucking earned it -- you smoke your nuts off, champion. If I were you I'd fire up right here in the God damn room. Fuck'em, you're immortal, you're a fucking God man. \nWHIP Harling... \nWHIP motions with his hands to \"calm down.\" \nHARLING MAYS Sorry Whip. It's just...this is big time, man. You're a hero in a time when we really need heroes. \nWHIP Shut the fuck up, Harling...Six people died. \nHARLING MAYS 96 people lived! When are you gonna take yes for an answer? Pick up the phone, man. Fuck. \nHARLING pulls something from his vest pocket and puts it in WHIP'S hand. WHIP looks at it and back at HARLING. \nHARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Here's a pint of Smirnoff and a few Red Bulls. You know what I'm sayin'? I know my customer. \nHARLING continues to pull items from the bag. \nWHIP Harling, take the vodka with you. \nHARLING freezes his frenzied energy with this odd command. \nHARLING MAYS What?! Take the vodka? Dude, are you insane? I'm gonna just tuck it in the bottom of your- \nWHIP Take the fucking vodka! \nHARLING hears him this time and raises his hand and nods, putting the VODKA back in his own duffel. HARLING tosses a tee shirt, sweat pants and flip-flops on the bed, then... \nHARLING MAYS Okay man. Check it out. \nHARLING holds up a silk Japanese Happi Coat, with elaborate stitching depicting colorful birds flying around Mt. Fuji. \nWHIP Look, I'm tired man. \nHARLING MAYS I'm out. You rest up. \nWHIP You gotta come and get me, tomorrow. \nWHIP pulls his keys from the bag that CHARLIE gave him. \nWHIP (CONT'D) Here are my keys. Go to the condo and bring me some nice clothes I can wear, my phone charger and grab the veal outta my fridge. It's marked. \nHARLING MAYS The veal? \nWHIP Yeah, the veal that's in my freezer. \nHARLING MAYS Done and done. What time you need me here? \nWHIP Tomorrow. I'll call you. \nHARLING MAYS Send the mayday and you're outta here in 7 minutes. (A SMILE) I got you a few stroke mags too. I've been in hospitals. I know what you need. JUGS, HOT MILFS in heat. ASSMASTERS. You should just stroke it all day. You're a hero -- know what I'm saying? If I was in here I'd be jerkin' it all day long. See, there's a smile. \nHARLING puts his hand on WHIP's forehead in an attempt to reassure him. A quiet moment before HARLING slips out. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- 11 PM -- SAME EVENING \nWHIP wakes up in a cold sweat. He is breathing heavy as he scans the room. LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window. Thunder RUMBLES. \nWHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine gum has been chewed through. WHIP uses his hands to get to the edge of the bed. He roots through the duffle bag that HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter still in its package. \nDetermined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been placed next to his bed. Leaning against the wheelchair is a medical cane. \nINT. HOSPITAL -- QUIET HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER \nWearing his Happi Coat (or robe), WHIP limps in to the empty hallway with the use of his cane. He checks the quiet corridor as he begins his quest... \nINT. HOSPITAL -- FIRE DOOR -- 11:38 PM \nThe door swings open, and no one appears to be on the other side. Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to slip through. A hand grabs the door and holds it. WHIP walks into the sanctity of the stairwell. \nINT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL -- SAME TIME \nWe find the owner of the helping hand was NICOLE who returns to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she demurely smokes a cigarette. \nWHIP Thank you. \nWHIP leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a pack of smokes from his pocket. \nWHIP (CONT'D) I didn't think anyone would have the same devious thought about using the fire stairs to have a smoke... \nNICOLE smiles and looks down, awkward around men when she is not loaded. She drops her cigarette which we see was barely smoked as she maneuvers to leave. \nWHIP (CONT'D) Don't go. I'll be quiet. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- AIRPLANE -- DAY \nWhip walks past the plane and starts to examine the large, two-story, open-ceilinged barn that is junked full of farm equipment and old furniture. He finds... \nA WALL OF PHOTOS -- WHIP WITH HIS FATHER NEXT TO A PLANE. HIS GRANDFATHER, FATHER and WHIP pose next to the barn. \nA CROP DUSTER acts as the background for a picture with a 15 year old WHIP and his father next to a small plane. \nA series of pictures feature the PLANE in flight and SHOTS TAKEN FROM THE PLANE, aerials of the farm, etc. \nWHIP holds the framed shot of he and his dad as he walks back to the plane, resting his arm on the wing. \nWHIP pulls himself from the wall of photos and stares at his stuff. We recognize what must be the stuff he took from his house after his divorce. We see bikes, weights and fishing gear. \nWhip rummages through a box of things packed from his home office. Trophies, sports memorabilia, citations -- A PHOTO OF HE AND HIS WIFE from happier times. THEIR WEDDING PHOTO. \nNow Whip comes upon A FRAMED BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of he and Charlie in their younger, Navy days -- wearing flight suits and standing on a carrier flight deck in front of an F-14 Tomcat. Big smiles, full of hotshot pilot swagger. \nWHIP puts the photo back and spots his golf bag. He roots out a pint of cheap vodka from the inner pocket. \nNext he finds a fifth of bourbon in his bicycle saddle bag. \nHe goes to the workbench and removes a couple of bottles from the paint shelf. \nEXT. BARN -- DAY \n63 Whip dumps out the liquor onto the grass as he hobbles back 63 to the house. \nEXT. WHITAKER FARM -- NIGHT \n65 WHIP uses just his cane now as he drags a garbage bag full of empty liquor bottles to his garbage cans. He tosses the bag of empties in a can. His work done, WHIP lights a smoke and stares at the empty fields that run forever as does the landscape of his mind. He quietly tries to grasp the horror he endured and the reality of his survival. \nINT. KITCHEN TABLE -- LATER THAT NIGHT \nWe hear the microwave beep and WHIP retrieves a frozen dinner. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM--LIVING ROOM DESK AREA--MOMENTS LATER \nWHIP sits at the coffee table eating his frozen dinner while watching news coverage of the crash. \nPHONE RINGS \nWHIP is startled by the phone that never rings. He snaps off the TV using the remote. \nWHIP is in no hurry to answer the phone as the old time ring continues. WHIP goes to the desk where the phone rests and he watches the old answering machine click on. We hear... \nWHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides. Please leave a message and it will be returned. Thank you. \nVOICE MAIL ...I think that was the beep. Hey Cowboy, it's Charlie again. \nWHIP reaches for the phone but decides to just listen to CHARLIE... \nCHARLIE (speaking to voicemail) I'm back in town and I stopped by the hospital tonight but they said you went home...so I guess you're feelin' pretty good, but um we went out to your condo and the manager said you had not returned. \nINT. CARR'S OFFICE -- ATLANTA BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT \nCHARLIE sits at a beautiful wooden table in a modern glass- walled office above a baseball field. The table is populated with casually-dressed businessmen and lawyers as this after- hours meeting was called on the fly. \nCRASH SCENE PHOTOS and FILES fill the table top. We also see a photo or two of the WHITAKER FARM. \nVOICE MAIL So...you may be with relatives, which I understand. I was really hoping to see you for breakfast. I'm at the St. Regis downtown. \nThere's an executive buffet on the 16th floor - 10 o'clock, okay? If you get this, please come. Some important stuff to cover. Be good. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- DESK AREA -- NIGHT \nWHIP stands still as a beep sounds, ending the message. \nINT. ST. REGIS HOTEL -- EXECUTIVE BUFFET -- MORNING \nThe executive buffet is a staple at the ST. REGIS. A long center table with silver trays houses eggs and breakfast meats. Fruit, bagels and a staff of servers cater to the business elite of Atlanta. \nCHARLIE ANDERSON sits at a corner table with HUGH LANG, a young, well-dressed African American man. CHARLIE and HUGH are chatting in jocular spirit when WHIP approaches, walking much more confidently with his cane. \nCHARLIE Whip, hey buddy. Glad you got my message. Grab a seat. \nWHIP studies HUGH as he pulls out his chair. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Whip this is Hugh Lang; he's an attorney from Chicago. \nHUGH stands and shakes hands with WHIP. \nHUGH Nice to meet you Captain Whitaker. \nWHIP and HUGH remain standing, both feeling a little \"alpha.\" \nCHARLIE Siddown. Coffee? (Whip nods, sits) Miss, can we get some fresh coffee? \nShe smiles and nods. She's off to get the coffee. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) We were just talking about your copilot's wife. She told a newspaper that \"God landed that plane.\" \nWHIP God landed the plane? \nWHIP just stares at the two men who have large buffet plates surrounding them. \nCHARLIE I too believe that God landed that plane. The same way I believe that God should hit the buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent. \nWHIP I'm good with coffee. \nCHARLIE Len Caldwell was really trying to get here this morning. (Whip seems lost) Len is the president of the pilots' union and he wanted to be here with us and meet with you but they wanted him at the crash site. So.. \nClose on TV -- A SPLIT SCREEN -- CNN's PIERS MORGAN on one side of the screen asking questions of JIM TILMON, an aviation expert. \nWE NOW SEE A PHOTO OF WHIP IN HIS SOUTHJET AIRLINE UNIFORM. \nPIERS MORGAN Captain Tilmon, we wanna play a portion of the black box that all of the news outlets have grabbed hold of... \nWHIP (ON TELEVISION) When I ask for power, push both of these forward. Got it? What's your son's name? \nWIDER...WHIP STEPS UP TO THE BAR, GLANCING AROUND. \nThe BARTENDER steps up to serve WHIP... \nBARTENDER What'll you have? \nWHIP Can I get an orange juice? \nThe BARTENDER leaves to grab the orange juice. \nTELEVISION -- The transcription and AUDIO of the cockpit recording continues... \nMARGARET (O.S.) Trevor. \nWHIP (O.S.) Say \"I love you Trevor.\" \nMARGARET (O.S.) Why? \nWHIP (O.S.) The black box. \nMARGARET (O.S.) I love you Trevor. Be a good boy. Mommy loves you. \nThe BARTENDER returns with the orange juice. \nBARTENDER That's it? \nWHIP And a double shot of Stoli. \nThe BARTENDER nods and turns in acknowledgement of the order. \nPIERS MORGAN (ON TELEVISION) Wow. That audio paints a strong picture. Captain Whitaker is surely a hero in my opinion. \nJIM TILMON (ON TELEVISION) Absolutely. However, every incident is different. The actions of the pilots on SouthJet 227 will be heavily scrutinized. It's protocol for any investigation. \nThe BARTENDER returns with a frosted glass and pours two shots over the ice. \nWHIP downs the vodka in a flash. \nThe OTHER BARTENDER has the remote and starts searching for more coverage of the crash. He stops at a local report. \nON TELEVISION WE SEE \nEXT. CRASH SITE -- DAY \nA REPORTER gives a lead in at the crash site. \nCRASH SITE REPORTER #1 Kevin, it's still chaotic here at the site. Apparently a small ministry was conducting services near to where the plane came down. So the scene here is a mix of survivors and first responders, I was able to catch up with an actual passenger moments ago... \nA YOUNG SHORT HAIRED BLONDE MAN GIVES HIS ACCOUNT \nPASSENGER 1 We were in a nose dive and people were screaming and yelling and then the plane turned upside down and we had to hold on to our seat belts to keep from falling out of our chairs -- I saw one kid fall to the floor and this flight attendant picked him up and handed him to his dad...I didn't see her again. \nCRASH SITE REPORTER #1 More details and more reports of the casualties are continuing to fly around. I can tell you that there appears to be many, many survivors. That's all I have for now. Kevin? \nAnother reporter has a passenger's account. \nCRASH SITE REPORTER #2 Rebecca, surviving passengers are being put in ambulances, police cruisers and even first responder vehicles and they are being taken to local hospitals for treatment. Some of the injured appear serious and it's safe to assume at this point that there are at least a few fatalities. Let's roll the tape of the passenger I caught up with earlier. \nA MAN with SHORT DARK HAIR explains his experience. \nPASSENGER 2 We turned like a corkscrew and all I could think was, \"this is really happening, I'm going to die\" and then all of a sudden the plane was upside down but steady and the pilot must have known how to fly it that way. He flipped it back over and landed it hard. \nCRASH SITE REPORTER #2 Obviously a harrowing ordeal for those on the troubled plane. This is Callie J Kenner for News 5. \nA third Reporter gets a FEMALE NEIGHBOR's perspective. \nCRASH SITE REPORTER #3 Folks in the houses that border this field came running from their houses... \nNEIGHBOR I thought it was thunder at first. But it shook the ground hard. Thunder don't do like that. I ran outside and I could hear people yelling and I could see a small fire at first. I just took the dogs and headed down there. Then I saw the plane crumpled on the ground. I never seen nothing like that in my life. \nCRASH SITE REPORTER #3 Just like that plane, this community is shattered. Folks here remain on edge as media trucks continue to line their small road and crowd the field where the plane still lies. Back to you, Tom. \nEXT. CRASH SITE -- NIGHT \nA news light shines on a lone reporter who stands atop a small hill above the crash field. \nCRASH SITE REPORTER #4 We're gonna take another look at the cell phone footage that captured the last moments of SouthJet's Flight 227. \nWE SEE THE GRAINY CELL PHONE FOOTAGE OF THE PLANE \nAfter the PLANE levels off and smacks down in the field, we return to REPORTER #4 in the crash field. \nCRASH SITE REPORTER #4 (CONT'D) Many hours have passed since the footage you just watched but the crash site remains active as investigators work through the night. Using flood lights and miners' caps, teams continue to comb the crash field looking for the answers to the hard questions as to what brought down SouthJet's flight 227. Those answers remain in darkness as do the broken pieces of the aircraft. Hopefully sunlight will bring answers. For now this is Kent Johnson reporting. \nINT./EXT. WHIP'S BUICK -- QWIK STOP LIQUOR STORE -- DAY \nA 12-pack of beer hits the passenger seat as Whip climbs behind the wheel. Whip cracks open a \"handle\" (half-gallon) of vodka and takes a liberal pull. Whip's shoulders relax as the alcohol kicks in. \n71 After a moment, he starts the car, shifts into gear -- downs 71 another huge slug of vodka -- and pulls out. \nINT. WHIP'S BUICK -- ATLANTA STREET -- DAY \nWhip is at the wheel. A cigarette in one hand, an open beer in the other. He cruises slowly -- searching street signs with his beer-buzzed eyes. \nWHIP Your car doesn't run? What were you gonna do? \nNICOLE I don't...I...I was... I don't know what I was gonna do. \nFran smirks. Whip drills Fran with his eyes... \nWHIP (with deliberate malice) Then put the fucking box in my car. \nFRAN's smirk fades. He relents and picks up the box as WHIP grabs the lighter shoulder bag and they head downstairs. \nINT. WHIP'S BUICK -- DAY \nNICOLE stares out the window as the city disappears. \nWHIP pulls a beer from the box and offers it to Nicole. NICOLE smiles, thinks about it...she shakes her head, \"no.\" \nWHIP pops the top and takes a drink. \nNICOLE What's your name? \nWHIP looks to her, she to him. They begin to laugh at the absurdity. When it subsides... \nWHIP Whip. \nNICOLE nods. A long moment quietly passes. \nNICOLE Thank you, Captain Whip. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nSmokey Robinson and the Miracles' \"You Really Got a Hold on Me\" plays as WHIP eases himself into a recliner using his cane. On the small table next to him rests his beer and an unopened bottle of bourbon with a glass of ice. WHIP cracks the seal on the bourbon bottle and pours a drink. He takes a sip and chases it with his beer. \nWHIP now starts to remove the brace that we clearly see under his basketball shorts. As he takes it off he tries to massage his aching leg. \nNICOLE enters the living room, fresh from a shower. WHIP studies her -- she's beautiful and innocent. \nWHIP You okay? \nNICOLE I was gonna lay down, get some rest. \nWHIP Okay. \nWHIP takes another sip before returning to massaging his leg. \nNICOLE Is it really okay that I stay here? \nWHIP Yea. I want you to stay. \nNICOLE walks over to WHIP and kneels down and gently takes over massaging his leg. WHIP exhales. \nWHIP (CONT'D) That feels better. \nNICOLE It's throbbing because the blood is having a hard time getting back to your heart. \n78 NICOLE continues to soothe his aching leg. After a moment, 78 NICOLE stands and takes the drink out of WHIP's hand and sets it down. She now bends down and kisses him softly. She now stands and takes his hand, leading him in to the bedroom. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- DAY \nWHIP's been awake for hours as he sits at the foot of the bed. Whip's wearing a long sleeve tee shirt and sweat pants and no shoes. He looks at NICOLE -- sleeping angelically on her side of the bed. Whip watches her sleep for a long moment, until... \n80 He hears something. He gets up and goes to the window. It's a car pulling up the driveway. \nINT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN DOOR -- DAY \nWHIP opens the door to find HUGH in his driveway. \nWHIP casts a strange figure with his bare chest, boxers and brandishing a shotgun. They stare at each other. \nHUGH Do you wanna shoot me or can I come inside? \nWHIP C'mon in. I'll shoot you inside. \nHUGH walks closer to the porch. WHIP questions him. \nWHIP (CONT'D) You just decided to drop by? \nHUGH Your voice mail is full and you never answer your cell phone. I called your cell 10 times. \nWHIP I turned it off. \nHUGH nods as the explanation lands. \nHUGH I thought we'd take a ride. \nWHIP measures HUGH's intention... \nWHIP Okay, gimme a minute. Wait here. \n82 HUGH nods and recedes from the door as WHIP goes to get 82 dressed. \nEXT. CRASH SITE -- OBSERVATION SCAFFOLDING -- DAY \nWHIP joins HUGH on a rectangular platform on top of a two- story scaffolding frame. The platform provides a perfect view of flight 227's final resting area. We see the awesome devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an hour can do to a hillside. \nHUGH You can see the initial impact sheared the right wing clean off. If only the left wing had come off at impact, I think everyone would have walked off that plane. \nWHIP The left wing partially pulled away- \nHUGH It snapped but stayed connected to the airframe. So it whipped back towards the plane, hit the fuselage in front of the tail. If you were sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on the left side, it was like being hit by a train. \nWHIP I drank a lot the night before that flight. I drank that morning too and I used coke to straighten up. \nHUGH I'm gonna kill the toxicology report. (feels eyes of disbelief) It was done incompetently. The last time the toxicology equipment they used was calibrated was in June of 2009, which is 18 months past code. Their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials and when, is very incomplete. And they aren't sure who stored them. They used a preservative in the vials that has in some cases caused blood to ferment and register higher in an alcohol test. That's what I've done so far. I can handle this. \nMR. CARR I like this guy Lenny. He makes me wanna go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet. \nLEN CALDWELL Mr. Carr, we're gonna fight to push all the fault on Jackson Ridgefield, the manufacturer. \nMR. CARR Oh and you think they're gonna just open their check book and buy us all lunch? Good fucking luck. What's my exposure Jim? \nCARR'S BUSINESS GUY The awards to the families could kill the airline. \nMR. CARR Fuck the airline. The insurance companies can have the goddamm airline. I just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets. \nLEN CALDWELL Speaking for the pilots' union? We don't want your airline to go away. We enjoy your contract with us and we will protect Captain Whitaker and in turn protect your airline. \nMR. CARR That's sweet Mr. Caldwell, but if the NTSB leaks that toxicology report showing my pilot was flying that plane drunk? We're all fucked. \nCHARLIE So far we've been lucky. \nMR. CARR Lucky?! Are you that goddammed dumb?! You think they're waiting for a light news day to splash the headline, \"Drunk, coke-addled pilot crashes a plane?!\" \nEVERYONE goes quiet as CARR's anger commands silence. \nMR. CARR (CONT'D) My brother's in DC on his knees at the foot of the throne begging for forgiveness. And so far it's working. \nThey've got their boot on the neck of this girl Ellen Block runnin' the show for the NTSB and she is pissed. Can you handle that? \nHUGH can't stifle a laugh. They look to him. \nHUGH LANG Trust me, I'm gonna kill the toxicology report. That's my job. \nCARR looks to his lawyer who nods... \nCARR'S ATTORNEY I wish you luck, but we're still sorting out the best way to go forward legally. We might split from you and go it alone. \nCARR stands to signal the end of the meeting. HUGH stands to stop him. \nHUGH LANG To go it alone? Without us? That would be what the French call \"a big fucking mistake.\" \nMR. CARR Does Whitaker know he's going to jail? \nHUGH LANG I haven't had a client go to jail yet. \nMR. CARR He's going to jail. He belongs in jail. You bet your ass he's going to jail, the question is...is he gonna die in jail? \nHUGH LANG You're wrong, Mr. Carr. \nCARR'S ATTORNEY Last time I checked, 6 counts of manslaughter is life in prison. \nMR. CARR Life in prison, what we in Georgia call \"all day long.\" \nIt goes quiet as everyone reflects on that reality. \nINT. CARR'S OFFICE -- WAITING ROOM -- DAY \nWHIP stands up as the meeting spills into the waiting room. Handshakes are exchanged as CARR walks to WHIP and offers his hand to shake. \nMR. CARR They tell me you're some kind of pilot. \n86 CARR nods, sizing WHIP up. WHIP returns the nod as HUGH 86 quickly puts a hand on WHIP's back and leads him away like a heavyweight being returned to his corner after pre-fight instructions. \nTHE TELEVISION IN WHIP'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWe are now in WHIP's living room watching HOME MOVIES... \nWHIP'S VOICE Get up! What? You can't get up?! (Whip is laughing...) C'mon, Knuckles Whitaker drags himself up and goes long...go. \nWe watch an 8 year-old WILL WHITAKER run long as the ball flies to him. He catches it and on-screen WHIP hollers. \nWHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) Touchdown Whitaker! Atta boy! C'mon back. What? Come back and do it again. Tired? Junior, you don't know tired. I'm not going out. You go out. Keep running. \nWe pull away from the screen to find WHIP who sits on the couch. A large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many dead beers and an ashtray that overflows. \nWHIP moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a cigarette from the pack and light it. He freezes at one point and places his hands straight out in front of himself, a strange, involuntary, drunken reset. His stare is a 1000 miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet. Oblivion. \nThe light from the HEADLIGHTS of a car in the driveway wash across the walls of the living room. We hear a car door open and women exchange good byes. \nSHEILA (O.S.) Keep coming back, Nicole. One day at a time. \nNICOLE (O.S.) I know, one day at a time. \n87A We hear them laugh as WHIP still stares in to space. 87A \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- DOOR -- NIGHT \nThe door pushes open and NICOLE comes in with the Big Book of AA in her hand. \nNICOLE Hey. Sorry I'm a little late, but we went for coffee after the meeting... (Whip doesn't look) Whip? \nNICOLE goes close to see WHIP look at her with a non-focused stare. She sees the table and reads the situation. \nNICOLE watches as WHIP stands up. In his oblivion he tries to focus. \nWHIP Don't, don't, don't! I'll get him. Knuckles, junior. See him. Yeah. I'm not calling again. Fuck him. He didn't call. Not back. Not calling back. \nNICOLE backs away as she watches the blacked-out ballet play itself out in slow, tragic fashion. WHIP motions to his lips as if he is smoking. He freezes and then steps forward and trips in to the coffee table. Whip falls to the ground. \nNICOLE checks WHIP's face to see his eyes partially opened but passed out. NICOLE goes to the bedroom and returns with a blanket that she covers WHIP with. She also places a pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to the side so he doesn't choke. \nNICOLE looks around the room. She begins to collect the bottles and straighten up. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- BEDROOM -- MORNING \nWHIP I'm nervous because I was out the night before the crash at dinner- \nMARGARET With Trina... \nWHIP Yeah and I had two glasses of wine. And they might ask you about my condition that morning and if you thought I had anything to drink. \nMARGARET appears speechless... \nWHIP (CONT'D) What? \nMARGARET I've known you 11 years and you're gonna stand here and tell me you and Trina went to dinner and you drank two glasses of wine? Sounds like a nice restaurant Whip, which one was it? \nWHIP You have to tell them it was an ordinary day. I mean it was an ordinary day. You know I was in shape to fly. You have a problem with saying that? \nMARGARET It's a lie. Whip, it's a lie. Trina told me you two hadn't been to sleep. \nWHIP My lack of sleep made the plane fall apart, huh Margaret? I'm just trying to get it straight. You think that another pilot would have been able to land that plane and save more lives? \nMARGARET I didn't say that Whip. I can't imagine another pilot doing- \nWHIP Well can you imagine Trevor at this same church looking at you in that box in there? Or my son having to come and see me in prison? \nMARGARET fights tears as WHIP has struck a blow. \nMARGARET Please Whip, enough. Don't you think we've all had enough. (Whip is quiet) What do you want me to say? \nWHIP It was an ordinary day. The storm right after we took off was very severe, but as far as the flight crew was concerned it was a perfectly ordinary day. \nThe tears flow now as MARGARET can't hold them in. WHIP realizes he's gone too far. Not knowing what to do, WHIP walks away. \nEXT. PEACH STREET DRUGS - AZURE BLUE SKY OF AUTUMN -- PHARMACY -- PARKING LOT - DAY \nWHIP watches an airliner fly over head as he stands by his car smoking a cigarette. He wears his suit from the funeral. NICOLE approaches. She's in a great mood. \nNICOLE Are you okay? How was it? \nWHIP It was okay, okay. How're you doin'? \nA beat. \nNICOLE Well, I got through my first day. They haven't fired me. \nWHIP That's good. Cause for a celebration. \nNICOLE They needed someone to work the night shift. They asked me and it's time and a half so... \nShe sorts through her shoulder bag... \nNICOLE (CONT'D) I gotta vest and here's my name tag. Oh oh oh....I got you something.. (hands him a nice lighter) It's a P-51 mustang on there... (flies her arms like WINGS) You're dad flew a P-51, right? \nWHIP (stares at the lighter) He did. So should we get some dinner? \nNICOLE I promised Sheila I would be at the meeting tonight. She's the one that's been helping me, my sponsor. Can we do it tomorrow night? And Please, Whip don't make me choose between dinner with you and the meeting. \nWHIP nods, playing with the lighter. \nWHIP No, it's okay. You should go. \nNICOLE Why don't you come with me? We'll eat after. It's an open meeting. \nWHIP Open meeting? \nNICOLE That means anybody can come. Anybody. \nWHIP Even me? \nShe is bubbling with happy spirit; she's hot. She's hard to deny as WHIP can't help but smile at her. \nINT. ST. FRANCIS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- ATLANTA -- NIGHT \nA MAN stands at a podium wearing a coat and tie. He is lost in the energized retell of a story. \nA.A. SPEAKER # 1 The cop is shining his flashlight on me. I'm standing there behind the dumpster, wearing nothing but my girlfriend's panties, vomit on my chest and I say to the cop...about two beers. \nThe room erupts with laughter. NICOLE is really taken by the candor of the speaker as she joins the room in laughter. \nA.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) That's why they call me \"Two-Beer\" Barry. \nBARRY makes eye contact with a STERN LOOKING OLD TIMER. BARRY holds up a loose leaf binder and addresses the man... \nA.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) Don't worry Ed, I got the format right here. I'm sorry, Ed's giving me the stink eye. Let me get back to the format... (reads from the format) I'm Barry. I'm an alcoholic. \nTHE ASSEMBLY (IN UNISON) Hi Barry. \nA.A. SPEAKER # 1 Are there any other alcoholics present? \nWHIP glances around to find himself in a sea of raised-handed alcoholics. A few look at WHIP with no judgement. \nA.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) I like meetings that have us all identify. Because it makes me tell the truth about who I am. It reminds that I never ever told the truth. I lied about everything. My whole life had been a lie. And I was told that I would never get sober if I kept lying. \nWHIP is very reserved, poker-faced. \nA.A. SPEAKER #1 I mean, lying's what I'm good at. If I know anything in this life it's how to lie, especially about my drinking. \nWe pan the faces and everyone seems immediately connected. Except WHIP who leans over to NICOLE. \nWHIP I gotta go. Okay? (NICOLE NODS) Can uh... (points to Sheila) \nNICOLE Yeah, Sheila. She can take me back to work. \nSHEILA (extends her hand) I'm Sheila. \nINT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY \nWHIP is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar. He sees the plane. \nThe JR-88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as possible. Like the skeleton of a T-Rex in a museum. The sight is awesome, breathtaking. WHIP walks closer to the twisted wreck and stops. WHIP is overwhelmed by the sight and as he is about to leave... \nCHARLIE steps out of the passenger door and calls down to WHIP. \nCHARLIE Here's our guy. C'mon. \nWHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the plane where the door used to be. CHARLIE stands at the top of the ramp. Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane... \nHUGH Captain Whitaker, we've won. \nWHIP doesn't move as HUGH starts down the ramp. \nHUGH (CONT'D) This is what we call in my profession a \"walk over.\" \nCHARLIE They've scheduled the hearing. It's in 10 days. \nCHARLIE and HUGH reach the bottom of the ramp. \nHUGH But these hearings can be tough. You just need to stay sharp and on course and answer the questions correctly. It's no longer a question of your condition but the condition of the plane. \nThis picks directly at the scab of WHIP's guilt. \nHUGH (CONT'D) I've had an \"Act of God\" successfully added to the list of probable causes. \nWHIP Look, it's simple. I flew a broken plane. \nCHARLIE You got it. That's right. \nWHIP And what about my toxicology report? \nHUGH (trying to stay calm) I killed it. They have no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane. And no eye witness claims. But there's a problem. \nThis stops WHIP cold. \nHUGH (CONT'D) Because of the turbulence at the beginning of the flight and then the crash, there was never any drink service on the flight. But, they found two little vodka bottles in the galley trash bin. There was no physical evidence found on the bottles, no DNA, no finger prints. But both the bottles were uncapped and empty. The only people who had access to those bottles and could have drank them were the flight crew. Margaret, Evans and Camelia Satou all had clean tox reports. That leaves you and Trina Marquez. \nThey let that land. WHIP nods. \nWHIP Okay. I see...where this is going. That's funny that they found two bottles. \nHUGH Why? \nWHIP Because I drank three. One's missing. \nHUGH explodes in frustration. \nHUGH LANG When I met you I couldn't believe what a flip, drunk, arrogant scumbag you were. \nWHIP Fuck you too, Hugh. \nHUGH LANG But I did the research and heard the analysis from the experts. I'm in awe of what you did. \nWHIP Can I go now? \nHUGH gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence to the coronation. \nHUGH LANG THE NTSB AND THE FAA TOOK 10 EXPERIENCED PILOTS AND PLACED THEM IN SIMULATORS. THEY RECREATED ALL OF THE EVENTS THAT LED TO THIS PLANE FALLING OUT OF THE SKY! \nHUGH is so loud and emotional even WHIP lends focus. \nHUGH LANG (CONT'D) Do you know how many were able to safely land these broken planes? \nEveryone waits for the response as HUGH acknowledges the debris around them... \nHUGH LANG (CONT'D) Not one. Every pilot crashed and killed everyone on board. \nWHIP Yeah. So? \nHUGH You have no capacity to accept the responsibility for the miracle you performed and the lives you saved. \nWHIP Great. I'm going home. \nWHIP pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the pack. \nHUGH LANG Do you want to go to prison? I'm trying to save your life! \nCHARLIE steps between them as this exchange spirals. \nWHIP What fucking life?! Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh. \nWHIP starts to walk away. \nHUGH Okay, I'm done here. I'm running out a faith that this guy's gonna make it, Charlie. \nWHIP (turns on Hugh) You wanna talk about me like I'm not here? Like I'm fucking dead? \nHUGH (to Whip now) This NTSB hearing is a Federal Agency Hearing. Do you understand that? It's in 10 days and if I show up with you like this?! \nWHIP turns and walks. HUGH wheels on CHARLIE and lights him up. \nHUGH (CONT'D) Everything we've done? Everything I've done? Goes out the window. That's not on me. I did my job. It's your job, Charlie, to get him straight and get him to the church on time. \nWHIP Yeah Charlie just get him home. Sober him up long enough to save the union's contract and that fat fuck's airline. Fuck you. I shoulda died on that plane. \n106 WHIP walks away from them -- away from the bright, clean, 106 shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm. \nEXT. ROAD OUTSIDE THE WHITAKER FARM -- DAY \nThe POLICE begin to disperse the NEWS RATS. WHIP pulls an officer aside. \nWHIP I'm Captain Whitaker, I was- \nYOUNG COP Yes sir, I know who you are. \nWHIP Can you get me to my car? \nYOUNG COP (STUDIES HIM) Anything you need, sir. \nWHIP walks with the YOUNG COP who shields him from the fray. \nINT. WHIP'S BUICK -- DEANA'S STREET -- MINUTES LATER \nWe can see the YOUNG COP standing in front of the driver side door, shielding WHIP from the press who stay away. \n116 WHIP exhales, trying to slow his racing heart and head. He's drunk but controlled. He looks at his hands. They are shaking. \nINT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -- OFFICE - CLOSE ON TELEVISION - NIGHT \nWe see WHIP on the TV repeating the speech he gave reporters on DEANA's front lawn... \nWHIP Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured. Thank you. I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace. \nA REPORTER now wraps up the piece... \nTELEVISION A reasonable request from a quiet, heroic man who's been through so much. This is Tilda Banden reporting from Devonwood. \nNow a DESK ANCHOR changes stories... \nDESK ANCHOR In a related story, tonight at 10 Cale Rawson talks with aviation experts to see if the tragedy of flight 227 could have been avoided. \nWe boom down to find WHIP who looks drained as he sits on CHARLIE's couch in the fastidiously neat office. WHIP holds an unlit smoke. \nThe WOODEN POCKET DOORS SLIDE OPEN and CHARLIE's WIFE gestures towards WHIP. WHIP stands as CHARLIE enters. \nWHIP Hey, Charlie. Thank you. Amanda was so nice to let me in. It's just...I couldn't find a safe place. \nAMANDA slides the door shut as CHARLIE throws his bag and his coat down with gusto. He reaches up and pushes a button on the TV and it goes off. \nCHARLIE What the hell is wrong with you? I spoke to Hugh, he told me that you went to your ex-wife's house? Drunk as a skunk and the news crews showed up? (Whip just stares) And the police escorted you out? \nWHIP I think it's okay. I've been watching and I think it's okay. \nCHARLIE Hugh checked every media outlet that covered it and it looks like we're good. You come off fine. \nWHIP Okay. Good then. Listen Charlie, here's the deal- \nCHARLIE No Whip. No deals. Look at you. I have no idea what you're gonna do or say, ever. You're all over the place. I was the one guy in your court. I was your apologist, your defender. But not anymore. \nWHIP No. I can do this. \nCHARLIE You're about to be questioned by a Federal Agency about piloting an airliner drunk...an airliner that crashed. And you continue to drink and stumble around. What kind of crazy do you have to be to do that? I'm scared of you. \nWHIP Let's just stick to the plan. \nCHARLIE You can't stick to anything. \nWHIP This whole thing has just been so heavy, it's killing me. Tell Hugh, I can do it. Look, I really wanna fly again, get back to my life and be done with all this shit. \nCHARLIE This hearing is 10 days away. Hugh busted his ass to try to get you excused, but there's no way. You have to appear. \nWHIP Let me stay here. They have my houses all staked out now. Let me stay here until the hearing, Charlie. I won't leave the house. \nCHARLIE takes a long look at his old, troubled friend. \nCHARLIE You can't drink here, Whip. You can't drink in my house. Can you do that? \nWHIP I won't drink. \n118 CHARLIE nods, hoping that WHIP can deliver on that promise 118 \nINT. ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nWe watch a can of Coca Cola swing in WHIP's hand. We pull out to find WHIP walking with CHARLIE down a hallway of THE ST. JEROME HOTEL. Time has passed as WHIP looks the best we've ever seen him look. He is well rested, well dressed and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag. \nAs we approach the open door to a guest room, HUGH pops out. A plain clothes SECURITY GUARD follows HUGH out of the room and stands behind him. \nHUGH You look great, Whip. I mean that. \nWHIP Thank you. I feel really good. \nHUGH I heard you haven't had a drink in 8 days. \nWHIP 9 days... (checks his watch) Two hours and 26 minutes...but who's counting? \nCHARLIE addresses the SECURITY GUARD. \nCHARLIE Officer Edmonds? \nOFFICER EDMONDS Yes sir. \nCHARLIE Whip, Officer Edmonds will be staying here tonight. Any problems he'll handle it. \nHUGH stands by the open door and gestures CHARLIE and WHIP inside... \nINT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nHUGH walks in to the center of the room and turns to WHIP. \nHUGH Well, Whip we just wanted to make this as easy for you as possible. \nWhip steps toward the box. \nCLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR. Whip swings open the door. \nWHOOSH -- OUR DARK SCREEN LIGHTS. \nCOLORS SPARKLE as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles GLOW like jewels in a chest. \nWHIP stares at the \"glimmering gems\" for a long, long time -- vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER, CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY. \nWHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it. \nNow Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists the tiny cap back on. \nWith a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away. \nWE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side -- ever so slowly, slowly. Then suddenly... \nWHAP!!! In a flash, WHIP SCOOPS THE VODKA OUT OF FRAME!! \nINT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - ELEVATOR DOORS - MORNING \nThe ELEVATOR DOORS open and HUGH and CHARLIE step out and head down the hallway. \nWe follow our guys as they approach WHIP's room, finding OFFICER EDMONDS exactly where we left him -- in front of WHIP's door. \nEXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - HALLWAY - WHIP'S DOOR - DAY \nOFFICER EDMONDS stands up as CHARLIE and HUGH approach carrying coffees. \nCHARLIE Good morning, how's our man? \nOFFICER EDMONDS Not a peep. \nCHARLIE knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits for WHIP to answer. CHARLIE cocks his head, knocks again. \nCHARLIE I think your pilot overslept. \nHUGH You didn't let any girls in there last night did you? \nOFFICER EDMONDS No sir, not a soul. No one came in or out. \nThey all wait awkwardly as HUGH checks his watch and knocks on the door. More silence... \nOFFICER EDMONDS (CONT'D) I have a room key. \nCHARLIE takes the room key and lets himself in. \nINT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING \nCHARLIE carefully enters WHIP's room. He is spooked by the silence. HUGH joins him as they take in the room. The bed looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be found. \nHUGH LANG Did he disappear? \nCHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room, the bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining room door. He turns to HUGH with a surprised look. \nCHARLIE Whip? Hello? \nCHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door. No response, so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open. \nINT. ADJOINING ROOM -- SAME TIME \nCHARLIE looks in to find the scene of the crime. Smoke still hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every surface in the room. HUGH joins him... \nHUGH Where is he? \nCHARLIE Whip? WHIP! \nCHARLIE closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads for the bathroom... \nBATHROOM -- ADJOINING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nCHARLIE is stopped by the sight of WHIP's lifeless body wedged between the tub and the toilet. \nCHARLIE WHIP?!!! WHIP!!! \nCHARLIE turns WHIP over to see his non-responsive face. HUGH arrives and freaks out. \nHUGH Is he dead? \nCHARLIE I DON'T KNOW!!! \nHUGH IS HE DEAD?! \nWHIP Yes!!! I'm dead!!! \nCHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing. OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them. \nOFFICER EDMONDS Should I get an ambulance? \nCHARLIE Yes! \nHUGH Wait!...just wait, Charlie...let's think about this. \nThe two stare at each other and realize they are both breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their predicament. \nCHARLIE Get him to the bed... (to the Officer) \nCan you wait outside and don't let anyone in here? Thank you. \nEDMONDS leaves. CHARLIE and HUGH drag WHIP out of the bathroom and flop him on the bed. HUGH explodes. \nCHARLIE puts the glass of water to WHIP's mouth. WHIP drinks. \nHARLING MAYS (CONT'D) (snaps his fingers) Coco puff... \nHUGH hands HARLING the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out tip. HARLING leans over the coke with the cigarette in his mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through the cigarette. \nHARLING sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of the cigarette. He tips it up and lights it. \nHARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Little coco puff buddy. C'mon banana man. Who's the banana man? \nWHIP's head levels a look to Harling with a smile that leads us to believe that he is actually making a rally. \nHARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Good man, focus up big dog. Here's the train comin' to you. \nHARLING takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine cigarette to WHIP. WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his head in acceptance of the cigarette. WHIP takes a drag and holds it. \nHARLING MAYS (CONT'D) (still holding the smoke) Keep it down big dog, banana boat's comin' tell me the banana boat's comin'... \nWHIP finally exhales the smoke, HARLING does too. WHIP smiles. \nWHIP The banana boat is here. \nHARLING MAYS Nothing can keep you down dog. Nothing keeps the big dog down. \nCHARLIE Okay, we gotta go. \nHARLING has crafted 4 big lines now, he snorts one himself in record time. Looks to HUGH and CHARLIE. \nHARLING MAYS You guys are up. \nHUGH No, I'm good. Charlie? \nCHARLIE Are you fucking crazy? \nWHIP jumps in and sniffs 2 huge lines. He looks to HARLING. \nWHIP Thanks brother, I'm back. \nHARLING gathers his things, stands and hugs WHIP. \nHARLING MAYS I love you man. \nWHIP I love you too. \nHUGH and CHARLIE are quiet as they watch the strange but sincere drug-fueled emotion pass between two old friends. HARLING eyes CHARLIE before handing him a baggie. \nHARLING MAYS There's a gram in here, you paid for it and he might need it. My work here is done. See you all on the dark side of the moon. \nHARLING leaves and our TRIO exchange looks, \"Did that just happen?\" \nEXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- DAY \n133 The opening bars of Joe Cocker's \"Feelin' Alright\" crackle 133 just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin a relatively steady strut down the hallway. Deja Vu. Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves, carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any evidence of the debauched night or the morning's resurrection. \nINT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR -- DAY \nWHIP, HUGH and CHARLIE ride the elevator. WHIP is buttoning his shirt and fixing his tie. It is miraculous how the coke has revived him. A MOM and her 8 year old DAUGHTER get on the elevator. \nCHARLIE Morning. \nWe watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIP's left nostril. HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, hands it to WHIP. \nHUGH Your nose... \nWHIP accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose. WHIP sees blood on the cloth and tilts his head back. \nWe now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator. WHIP tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he holds the hankie to his nose. WHIP begins to wobble and CHARLIE helps him regain his balance. \nINT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL-ELEVATOR LOBBY-MOMENTS LATER \nOur TRIO walk as tall as they can towards the hearing room. \nHUGH I'm gonna head in and tell Ellen Block that we're here. \nHUGH hustles off as CHARLIE pulls close to WHIP. \nCHARLIE You're gonna make it. Remember, if they ask about your drinking, it's totally acceptable to say, \"I don't recall.\" \nWHIP wheels on CHARLIE and unloads with focused anger... \nWHIP Do not tell me how to lie about my drinking. I've been lying about my drinking my whole life. \nAs we disappear in to WHIP's weary eyes we hear the distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air. \nINT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - BALL ROOM - NTSB HEARING-DAY \nOn TWO LARGE SCREENS we watch the grainy cell phone footage shot by a witness of SOUTHJET FLIGHT 227's final moments in the sky. ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the cockpit voice recording... \nThe room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit. A large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield that hangs above the proceedings. A large drop down screen will show images, graph and text as needed by the NTSB. \nA confident woman, ELLEN BLOCK, approaches carrying a file which she lays on the podium. \nELLEN BLOCK Those are difficult images to watch. For the record, I'm Ellen Block, Hearing Officer for this hearing. Captain Whitaker, good morning. \nWe see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair. \nWHIP Morning. \nELLEN BLOCK What was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute in what is considered a \"full pitch nose down\" attitude. Then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created animated simulation that I would like to play at this point. \nELLEN points to the screen... \nSit stone faced in the second row feeling the relief of months of hard work. \nELLEN BLOCK continues with a rote posture... \nELLEN BLOCK On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job? \nWHIP No. I did not. \nELLEN wraps up this line of questions... \nELLEN BLOCK Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction? \nWHIP waits for her to look at him...this takes a while... \nWHIP No. \nHUGH maintains a poker face; CHARLIE appears relieved. \nELLEN sorts through her notes one last time. \nELLEN BLOCK Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done. (She refers to her notes) Due to the severe turbulence during the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane. Is that correct? \nWHIP Yes. I suspended the drink service. \nELLEN BLOCK Are you aware that our investigators found two single- service Vodka bottles in the galley trash bin? \nSlides now show the TWO SMALL VODKA BOTTLES in evidence. \nWHIP Yes. \nELLEN BLOCK There were 5 crew members on board the flight who would have had access to the beverage trolley. Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of the crew members. Yourself... \nA SOUTHJET CORPORATE PHOTO OF WHIP pops on to the large monitors. After ELLEN references a member of the flight crew, their photo pops on to the monitors... \nELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) First Officer Evans, flight attendant Margaret Thomason and posthumously from Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. \nKATERINA MARQUEZ PHOTO does not pop up on the screen...yet. \nELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) A toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative, one was disqualified for technical reasons... \nHugh smiles -- satisfied. \nELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) And one tested positive for alcohol. It registered a .17 blood alcohol level. Are you aware of that? \nWHIP I am now. \nELLEN BLOCK Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work? Correct? \nWHIP Outside of work? Not really. \nELLEN BLOCK Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem? \nWHIP No. I did not. \nELLEN BLOCK Did you ever see her drink to excess? \nWHIP No. I did not. \nELLEN BLOCK Did you know that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction? The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines? \nWHIP No. I did not. \nA picture of Trina's beautiful smiling face FLASHES UP ON THE BIG SCREEN. \nELLEN BLOCK Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank the vodka on the plane? \nWHIP smiles at the photo of TRINA as if she can see him. He then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great spirit. He gets serious as he bears his look down on ELLEN. \nWHIP Can you repeat the question? \nELLEN BLOCK Your opinion Captain. Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? \nWhip shakes. He runs his trembling hand through his hair. \nWHIP I'm sorry. My what... \nELLEN BLOCK Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissable in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those 2 bottles of vodka on the flight? \nWhip drops his head and MUTTERS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE. \nELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) I'm sorry Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't hear you. What did you say? \nWHIP I SAID...God help me... \nA confused MUMBLE rises in the room. Whip's response flusters ELLEN for a moment, but she recovers quickly. \nELLEN BLOCK Yes, well. However, is it your opinion... \nWhip cuts her off... \nWHIP (EXCESSIVELY LOUD) IT'S MY OPINION... (lowers his voice) It's my opinion... Trina DID NOT...drink the vodka. \nELLEN BLOCK Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker... \nWHIP (softly, to himself) She saved that boy's life... \nELLEN BLOCK Captain Whitaker can you speak LOUDER- \nWHIP (LOUD AGAIN) I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE DID NOT DRINK THAT VODKA... \nWhip stops. His whole body trembles, his face tightens. He looks right at ELLEN... \n", "test1_input": "KIP Nicole, this is Tiki Pot. He's my partner in this new series, he knows a lot about porn. \nNICOLE Kip I need 2 grams of \"h.\" \nKIP Tiki and I are trying to put the narrative back in porn. Our Desdemona hasn't shown yet. (a great idea hatches...) You should play Desdemona. FUCK YEAH! You got that fair skin. \nKIP is flirting, seeing if she'll consider it... \nNICOLE Desdemona? What the fuck? \nTIKI does a line and comes up babbling. \nTIKI POT She do anal, two thousand, one hour. \nNICOLE I don't do porn, Kip. Just lemme see the \"h.\" \nKIP Just listen, we're doing an Othello theme where the Moor finds you in bed with your nurse and- \nNICOLE He fucks me in the ass? \nKIP Well...yeah. We're giving a whole new meaning to the \"beast with two backs.\" That's actually a title we're toying with...'beast with two backs' or Hole-thelo or Butt Hole- thelo...would you be up for it? \nTIKI POT College kid, very clean...BRETT?! \nA tall thin kid joins them. He wears a Moorish Headdress and has a bath towel wrapped around his waist. \nTIKI POT (CONT'D) Show her the pipe- \nBRETT drops the towel... \nNICOLE Fuck you Tiki, you put that in your ass and call me in the morning. Kip, have I ever done that shit for you? Never. Asshole. \nNICOLE walks away. KIP follows her...at the door. \nKIP Nic...sorry, we're tweaked, okay baby girl. Hey, c'mon you wanna stay and shoot some stills for me, you're pics are awesome. And what's going on with you? You were clean for a while and... (she begins to cry) Sweetheart, don't cry. \nNICOLE I just need a little to smoke. (flashes the cash) I've got 100. \nKIP pulls a small tin foil square from his vest pocket. \nKIP No, keep your money, okay? But, Nicole, this is the Taliban baby, very big time. It will take you down. \nNICOLE I can handle it. \nKIP (CONT'D) Don't shoot this shit, it is way too heavy. \nNICOLE I'm just gonna smoke it. I haven't done needles in weeks. \nKIP Okay, no needles and take a little coke and if you start going down just whiff a little. Okay? I wanna see you... \nKIP hands her a tiny baggy of coke. He kisses her cheek. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COCKPIT -- MORNING \nOut the window...nothing...the rain pounds. WHIP leans close to the windshield in an attempt to improve his view. \nEVANS reaches down and throws a switch. The windshield wipers go on. We can now see very clearly the path of lights the plane is to follow. WHIP looks to EVANS, smiles with stoned eyes. \nWHIP Thanks junior. \nEVANS looks out at the rain... \nEVANS Looks pretty ugly, sir. \nWHIP A little rain never hurt anybody. We're not made of sugar. What's the RVR? \nEVANS Half a mile. Right at minimums. Wind's gusting to 29. 30 is our crosswind max. \nWHIP I know what our crosswind max is. Tellem were good to go at the end. \nEVANS just stares at WHIP. \nGROUND CONTROL (ON RADIO) SouthJet 227, say intentions. \nWHIP looks right at EVANS. EVANS keys the radio. \nEVANS Orlando ground. SouthJet 227 will be ready to go at the end. \nWHIP stares forward, not looking at EVANS. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY \nNervous passengers stare out the windows as the JR-88 lumbers along the tarmac, headed for the runway. \nWe follow TRINA whose ass looks as good in a tight navy skirt as it does split bare with orange fluorescence. MARGARET speaks into the PA mic. \nMARGARET Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seat-belt sign. Please be sure your seat-belts are securely fastened, and all carry-on items are safely stored in the over- head bin, or under the seat in front of you. Also, all personal electronic devices must be switched off, at this time. Today's flight time to Atlanta should be 52 minutes. Flight attendants please take your seats. \n16 TRINA straps into her jump-seat. 16 \nINT. COCKPIT -- MORNING -- POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD \nHeavy rain lashes the nose of the plane. Lightning FLASHES. We watch the plane steer on to the GLOWING center-line. \nINT. COCKPIT \nWhip inhales his coffee and readies himself for take-off. EVANS tries to relax, continuing with the checklist. \nEVANS (reading the check-list) Elevator trim - set. Flaps, One, two, three - set. Radios - set. \n", "test1_true": "TOWER (ON RADIO) SouthJet 227, wind is one-zero-zero at seventeen. Runway 18L, cleared for take off. \nWHIP has razor focus as he places his hand on the throttle. EVANS sits upright and prepares for battle. \nEVANS (keys the mic) Cleared for take off, SouthJet 227. \nWhip pushes the throttles and the engines SCREAM as they spool up to full thrust. After a beat, he releases the brakes. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY \nThe passengers are pressed into their seats like blades of grass as the breeze of the plane's momentum moves them towards flight. The main lights in the cabin go out and the small glow of the aisle lights lead us back to the cockpit. \nINT. AIRPLANE COCKPIT - DAY \nWHIP mans the stick as he squints his eyes and tries to keep the nose between the lights of the runway. \nWHIP It's like a video game, right? \nWHIP laughs and turns to his copilot. EVANS is visibly nervous as he begins the take-off check... \nEVANS Airspeed's alive, both sides... Engine instruments are in the green...100 knots crosscheck... \nThe JR-88 fishtails as the main gear begins to hydroplane. \nWHIP Yep, nothing like a little 30 knot cross wind to exercise that sphincter muscle. \nEvans is jostled violently. \nEVANS That's wind shear! A micro burst! \nWhip's eyes are focused on the end of the runway. \nThe RED THRESHOLD LIGHTS are approaching fast. The plane is not lifting off. \nEVANS (CONT'D) Less than a thousand feet to go! \nWhip snaps at him. \nWHIP Just watch my airspeed! \nC.U. The airspeed indicator reads 145... \nEVANS V1...and... \nNow the air speed indicator climbs to 160... \nEVANS (CONT'D) ...rotate. \nWhip pulls back on the yoke, and... \nThe plane jerks up and we can hear the fuselage flex as we leave the ground. The plane is immediately buffeted by severe turbulence. \nEVANS (CONT'D) That's wind shear for sure! \nWHIP Yeehaw! Ride `em cowboy. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY \nThe passengers are rattled like a bag of marbles. \nINT. COCKPIT - DAY \nThe plane is loping up as the rain continues to pound the windshield. The ascent is very bumpy as the turbulent wind tosses the plane side to side. Copilot EVANS is communicating with Air Traffic Control... \nEVANS Orlando Departure...SouthJet 227, climbing out of 2500 for 5 thousand, runway heading. \nATC (ON RADIO) Roger SouthJet 227. Turn left heading one-seven-zero. Climb, maintain niner thousand. \nEVANS Left to 170. Climb, maintain niner thousand. \nEVANS quickly dials the heading and altitude into the auto- pilot. \nWHIP I don't want the auto-pilot. I'm flying. \nATC (ON RADIO) What's your ride like, SouthJet \nBefore EVANS can answer, WHIP jumps on the radio. \nWHIP Ah, Departure, we've got some rough chop here. I'd say moderate to... \nWHUMP!! The plane hits a severe bump! EVAN's headset turns sideways and he quickly rights it. WHIP chokes back a nervous chuckle. \nWHIP (CONT'D) (into his mic) No, severe. Definitely severe turbulence. No meal service today. \nAIR TRAFFIC CONTROL Roger that. \nWhump!! Once again the plane is violently rocked. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY \nThe passengers audibly HOWL as the roller coaster dip lifts most of their stomachs into their throats. A few overhead luggage bins fly open and bags and coats rain down. \nThe THREE ATTENDANTS calmly collect the luggage and stow it in the kitchen. They talk loudly for the benefit of the passengers. \nTRINA (to a passenger) This happened last week, always bumpy outta Orlando. Right Cam? \nMARGARET grabs the cabin mic and addresses the passengers. \nMARGARET Ladies and Gentlemen, the captain has asked that until we clear this air you stay seated with your seat belts fastened. Thank you. \nINT. COCKPIT - DAY \n", "test2_input": "WHIP Here's a pack. \nGAUNT YOUNG MAN Thank you, I'll pass them out in the cancer ward. Take care Nicole, you're gonna be okay. \nThe GAUNT YOUNG MAN leaves, clanging away with his I.V. pole. \nNICOLE wipes away her tears, we see her hospital bracelet as well as her track marks. \nNICOLE Chemo brain. Chemo makes you pretty foggy. \nWHIP Yeah? \nNICOLE They call it chemo brain, my mom used to slur her words and get all chatty. \nWHIP Your mom had cancer. \nNICOLE Breast cancer, she was only 54. \nIt's quiet. \nWHIP But why'd that guy ask you if you were gonna die? \nNICOLE I dunno. I flat-lined twice in the ambulance. Heroin addicts who use needles tend to die. Especially women for some reason. \nWHIP Is that right? \nNICOLE I have a pamphlet to prove it. A girl from AA just came to see me -- (IT'S QUIET) That guy was a trip. He made it feel like, I dunno...we were the last people left on the planet.. (drops her smoke) ...and together we should save the world. \nNICOLE steps on her cigarette and puts the nub in her pocket. She begins to leave. WHIP stops her. \nWHIP Well, where should we live? If we're gonna save the world, where should we do that? \nNICOLE laughs. \nWHIP (CONT'D) What? \nNICOLE You don't want me. \nWHIP laughs. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) What? \nWHIP You don't want me either. \nNICOLE's laugh tapers off as she senses his honesty. \nWHIP (CONT'D) Where do you live? \nNICOLE Why you wanna come visit? It's luxurious. (silence between them) I live in Bankhead, it's south Atlanta, near the bus station. \nWHIP The luxurious bus station? \nNICOLE Yeah. \nWHIP I'll come visit you. \nNICOLE You're sweet. \nWHIP I will. What's your address? \nShe measures him. \nNICOLE I live at the Georgian Gardens on Taylor street. \nWHIP Georgian Gardens? \nNICOLE Yeah. \nWHIP How long are you staying here? \nNICOLE Trying to stay as long as I can but I don't have insurance to cover rehab. I'll prolly be out tomorrow. \nWHIP Oh. Okay. And you're a masseuse? \nNICOLE Yeah. \nWHIP What kind of masseuse? \nNICOLE I've been every kind of masseuse there is. \nThere is strong tension between them. An orderly busts through the down the stairs. This breaks their stare. \nWHIP Good luck Nicole. \nNICOLE You too. \nWHIP leaves NICOLE where he found her. \nEXT. ST. FRANCIS REGIONAL MEDICAL HOSPITAL-LOADING DOCK-DAY \nWHIP is wheeled out of a service exit by an ORDERLY who also holds the duffle bag of WHIP's stuff around his neck. Whip no longer wears the eye patch but has a butterfly bandage over his left eye brow. \nHARLING jumps out of his 2001 Cadillac STS and immediately takes over, grabbing the duffel bag. \nWHIP Thanks Mike. \nThe ORDERLY tries to hand WHIP a medical file. HARLING snatches it. \nHARLING MAYS Yeah, thanks Mike. (Harling tips him) Here's 20 American. \nORDERLY MIKE Thanks. Good luck, sir. \n", "test2_true": "HARLING uses his key fob to remotely pop the trunk and stow Whip's duffel. \nHARLING MAYS This is how they get the Stones out of Madison Square Garden, man. 4 smoked black limos fly outta the VIP driveway and the fans jump on the limos...mayhem. Those limos? Empty. Meanwhile, Mick and the boys go out the service exit into delivery vans -- casual, rock star type shit. \nHARLING helps him into the front seat and they pull away. \nThe Stones, \"Gimme Shelter\" starts to play... \n53 As they drive off, we see media mayhem collected in front of 53 the hospital. Trucks with towers, cameramen, stringers and newscasters add to catering trucks and coffee stands as the vultures wait for the carrion of sound bytes and footage of survivors. \nINT. HARLING'S CADDY -- DAY \nWhip watches through the rear window -- the \"Media Circus\" disappears as the Caddy rounds a corner. The back seat is piled with Whip's clothes, most of them still on hangers. \nHARLING lights a cigarette and hands one to WHIP who takes it. \nHARLING MAYS I couldn't find any suitcases so I just put your shit in grocery bags. \nHARLING pulls a cold Becks from a cooler on the floor of the back seat and uses a bottle opener that's been screwed to the dash of his car next to the radio to open the beer. He offers the beer to WHIP who waves it off. HARLING gladly keeps it for himself... \"Gimme Shelter\" continues to play... \nHARLING MAYS (CONT'D) So you're stayin' with me down on University, right? It's nice. A lotta young people...good vibe. \nHarling tosses Whip a freezer bag marked:\"VEAL\" -- Whip begins to open it. \nWHIP No. I'm gonna go to the farm. \nHARLING MAYS The fucking farm? \nWHIP My dad's place. I can't stay at my condo. \nHARLING MAYS I thought you sold that fucking place. \nWHIP Not yet. \nHARLING MAYS I'm not sure I wanna stay at the farm. \nWHIP You're not. Just take me to the airport to get my car. \nWhip finishes opening the freezer bag -- it's full of cash. \nHARLING starts to laugh... \nHARLING MAYS 58 Veal? Really? Don't you know the 58 first place every two-bit thief looks is in the freezer? \nEXT. ATLANTA RURAL SUBURBAN ROAD - WHIP'S FARM - DAY \nWHIP's BUICK turns off the blacktop past a small weathered billboard: WHITAKER CROP DUSTING. Also a real estate \"FOR SALE\" sign is posted in front. \nEXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- DAY \nWhip pulls into a long, dirt driveway that approaches a one- story farm house. He gets out of the car. With his cane in one hand, he uses his free hand to toss the grocery bags close to the steps and heads inside. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWHIP ambles in and we see the interior of the house bears the fading patina of a proud American Family. We see PHOTOS -- WHIP in his NAVAL FLYER UNIFORM. A GROUP MILITARY PHOTO -- a SQUADRON of NAVAL FLIERS on a carrier. WHIP's PARENTS next to the farm house. WHIP's FATHER stands next to WHIP who is holding his infant son. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- DESK AREA - DAY \nWHIP empties his pockets onto the desk top. His keys, wallet and his cell phone are placed next to an old rotary phone attached to an old answering machine. WHIP plugs in his cell phone charge, dials in for his messages and puts it in \"speaker mode\" as we hear... \nCELL PHONE You have 127 messages. (A BEEP) Message one...\"Captain Whitaker, this is Jim Court I'm with CNN. We'd like to schedule an interview...\" (he deletes that message) Message two...\"This is NBC affiliate KGAT in Athens we're looking to contact William J. Whitaker for...\" (he deletes and moves on) Message three...\"Captain Whitaker, this is Karen James, media relations with the pilots' union...\" \nWHIP again deletes the message and decides to just shut the phone down. He continues to empty his pockets. In his jacket pocket he finds a prescription bottle of pain pills. \nWHIP holds it up, opens it and pours a few out in his hand. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nWHIP pours the pain pills into the toilet. He then opens the medicine cabinet and starts to empty all of the bottles into the toilet. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER \nWHIP goes to the collection of liquor bottles next to the sink that act as a makeshift bar. He picks up a bottle of vodka. He unscrews the cap and sniffs the contents. He slowly tips the bottle and pours it into the sink. \nWhip opens the refrigerator and removes an assortment of beers. He pops them open and pours them in the sink. The faucet running to offset the pungent smell. \nINT. BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nWhip opens a dresser drawer and finds a couple of zip-lock bags of \"bud\" hidden under the socks. \nINT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nWhip dumps the weed into the toilet and FLUSHES it. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nA cigarette dangles from WHIP's mouth as he ferrets around the room, showing the focus and determination of a serial killer cleaning his kill site. He finds rolling papers, roaches, more liquor and weed -- he reaches into the Shell Bag that's hanging next to the shotgun rack and finds another \"pint.\" \nINT. KITCHEN -- LATER \nWhip opens the freezer to put in his frozen dinner and his \"packet of veal\" and finds another fifth of vodka. \nHe pours the vodka in the sink and tosses the bottle into the trash -- which is piled high with empties. \nThrough the kitchen window, Whip sees the farm's old weathered barn. Whip furrows his brow. \nEXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- DAY \nWHIP slides open the heavy barn doors to reveal -- A VINTAGE CESSNA 172 -- covered in dust and bird shit from the years of stagnant storage. \nWHIP lights a smoke as he marvels at the little piece of aviation history resting in his barn. \n", "test3_input": "EVANS (CONT'D) The flight was pre-ordained. I've prayed on it Captain. Vicki and I have prayed on it. There's only one judge -- \nVICKI EVANS Praise Jesus. \nEVANS And he has a higher plan for you sir. This event although tragic in its loss of life is also a celebration of life. \nEVANS begins to mist up with sincere inspiration. \nEVANS (CONT'D) Nothing happens in the Kingdom of the Lord by mistake. \nVICKI EVANS Praise Jesus. \nEVANS Captain, will you pray with me? \nWHIP stares into EVANS' eyes and sees a believer's conviction. EVANS reaches out his hand to WHIP. \nWHIP slowly moves out of his chair and kneels at the side of EVANS' bed. WHIP takes EVANS' hand and bows his head as he reaches for VICKI's at the same time. It's quiet before... \nEVANS (CONT'D) Jesus our Lord and savior we thank you for blessing Captain Whitaker with courage and wisdom. For guiding his hand on that fateful morning. In his divine light we were saved. Praise Jesus. \nVICKI EVANS Praise Jesus. \nIt is quiet for an extended beat. Finally... \nWHIP Praise Jesus. \n97 WHIP looks at EVANS and his WIFE whose heads are bowed with 97 reverence. \nEXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT \nA small pickup truck rambles to a stop in the driveway. We hear music and laughter as NICOLE gets out. \nNICOLE Thanks for the ride guys. I'll see you tomorrow. \nCOWORKER Keep it up Nicole, you could be employee of the year. \nThey all laugh; Nicole waves as they drive off. She walks towards the house which is dark. She hears music and looks towards the barn to see bright light escaping through the sagging doors and split wood walls. \nEXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT \nNICOLE slowly approaches the almost glowing barn door. Her curiosity compels her to pull it open. \nINT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT \nThe door swings open to find the plane pointed towards the driveway with an aged patina but revitalized shine. Lenny Kravitz, \"Fly Away\" blares from the stereo... \nWHIP emerges from the cockpit. He's still in his suit but with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up. He's energized like an excited kid. He runs up and kisses her. \nNICOLE notes the cloud of smoke hanging in the air and the burning cigarette in the ashtray, empty beers. \nWHIP Looks great right? \nNICOLE It's kind of...beautiful. \nWHIP wipes at his nose. \nWHIP It's a Cessna 172, it was my dad's. He kept it perfect. \nNICOLE takes in this cool trinket of aviation history. \nNICOLE Does it work... \nWHIP Yeah, he flew this plane a few months before he died. I learned to fly in this plane. You can land it anywhere. \nWHIP laughs, remembering... \nWHIP (CONT'D) My friend Harling and I flew it to Jamaica. \nNICOLE Jamaica? In this? \nWHIP We set off for an overnight fishing trip two hours south of here. We ended up in Bethel, Jamaica. \nNICOLE You're insane. \nWHIP It was like a picture on a post card. The white sand and sky blue water. Most beautiful place I've ever been. \nNICOLE Was the water warm? \nWHIP Yeah, really warm. \nNICOLE That's my kind of place. \nWHIP Let's go. \nNICOLE Sure, why not. \nNICOLE laughs thinking they're playing a game. \nWHIP Let's go tomorrow. \nNICOLE You're serious? \nWHIP We'll leave in the morning...we'll just go. Start over. \nNICOLE realizes he's serious as he opens another beer. \nNICOLE Whip, we can't. \nWHIP It's a beautiful beach, it's paradise. \nNICOLE I'm worried about you. \n", "test3_true": "NICOLE No you're not, you're really not. You need help, Whip. I think you need rehab. \nWHIP You go to a couple of AA meetings and all of a sudden you think you're Jesus Christ? Worry about yourself. \nNICOLE We're the same Whip, you and me, we're the same- \nWHIP WE'RE NOT- \nNICOLE WE ARE- \nWHIP I didn't suck dick to get high. And don't give me a whole... \nNICOLE Never Whip, I never in my life- \nWHIP Your mom died and dad drank and bullshit, bullshit, bullshit -- \nNICOLE Stop. Please stop. \nWHIP Is that why you shot dope? \nNICOLE That's not fair- \nWHIP Well there's a lot of people out there who lost their mom who've never had a drink in their life. \nNICOLE You're sick, Whip. \nNICOLE walks away, leaving WHIP with his plane and his dream of freedom. WHIP calls after her. \nWHIP I choose to drink. \nNICOLE Do you? You choose it? I don't see a lot of choice goin' on. \nWHIP I choose to drink! And I blame it on me. I'm happy to. I've got an ex-wife and a son I don't see. Why? Because I choose to drink! \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nWe follow WHIP as he enters the house and approaches the doorway of the bedroom. WHIP sees NICOLE sitting on the bed. She quickly tucks her cell phone away as WHIP holds up his hand to signal a truce. \nWHIP Alright look, I was loaded when I crashed that plane. With this investigation going on, I don't know what's gonna happen. Come to Jamaica with me. \nNICOLE Whip. I'm afraid I'll use again. \nWHIP Come with me. I need help, I do. \nNICOLE I'd love for you to get help, Whip. \nWHIP When we get to Jamaica we can go to the local hospital. I'll do it for you. Anything you want. \nNICOLE looks at the sincere love in his eyes. \nNICOLE I don't wanna use again. I can't. I won't make it back. \nWHIP I'll be sober. I won't force you to stay. I promise if you don't like it or if I don't clean up? You can leave. \nThis is the most sincere plea she's ever heard. \nWHIP (CONT'D) It's so beautiful there. We'll leave before noon. I'm a great pilot. You'll get to see so much. \nWHIP wraps his arms around her. We stay on NICOLE's face as he holds her tighter and tighter. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING \nNICOLE is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table. Past NICOLE we can see WHIP lying in bed. \nShe has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at her feet. She finishes a handwritten note and places it down. NICOLE picks up the note and begins to reread it. \nShe hears a car in the driveway -- she picks up her stuff and takes one last look at the sleeping WHIP. She leaves, careful not to make a sound. \nEXT. WHITAKER FARM -- FRONT DOOR -- EARLY MORNING \nNICOLE quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her stuff. She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as she makes her way to SHEILA's car that we see parked at the top of the driveway, far from the house. \nINT. WHITAKER RANCH -- BEDROOM -- LATER SAME DAY \nWHIP stirs, wakes up and looks around. WHIP walks around looking for NICOLE. He finds the note and reads it. The reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the window and stares out at the barn. \nWHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big book of AA on the table near where the letter was left. WHIP picks it up and throws it across the room. He then grabs the back of a chair and tosses it against the wall. \nAfter wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall. The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his son. \nWe hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE. WHIP relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him. \nWhip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is answered by the old machine... \nWHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides. Please leave a message and it will be returned. Thank you. \nThe beep concludes... \nCHARLIE (speaking to voice mail) Hey Whip, if you're there pickup...I got some good news... \nWHIP snatches the phone of the hook. \nWHIP Yeah, I'm here. What's goin' on? \n104 WHIP listens as CHARLIE talks... 104 \nEXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY \nWHIP sits in his car. Rain pounds the windshield as we watch him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice. WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink. \nWHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and stowing it in the glove box. WHIP gets out and we watch him walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar. A SECURITY GUARD meets him and takes him inside. \n"}

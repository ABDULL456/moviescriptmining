EVANS reaches out his hand to WHIP. \nWHIP slowly moves out of his chair and kneels at the side of EVANS' bed. WHIP takes EVANS' hand and bows his head as he reaches for VICKI's at the same time. It's quiet before... \nEVANS (CONT'D) Jesus our Lord and savior we thank you for blessing Captain Whitaker with courage and wisdom. For guiding his hand on that fateful morning.

Finally... \nWHIP Praise Jesus. \n97 WHIP looks at EVANS and his WIFE whose heads are bowed with 97 reverence. \nEXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT \nA small pickup truck rambles to a stop in the driveway. We hear music and laughter as NICOLE gets out. \nNICOLE Thanks for the ride guys. I'll see you tomorrow. \nCOWORKER Keep it up Nicole, you could be employee of the year. \nThey all laugh; Nicole waves as they drive off. She walks towards the house which is dark. She hears music and looks towards the barn to see bright light escaping through the sagging doors and split wood walls. \nEXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT \nNICOLE slowly approaches the almost glowing barn door. Her curiosity compels her to pull it open. \nINT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT \nThe door swings open to find the plane pointed towards the driveway with an aged patina but revitalized shine. Lenny Kravitz, \"Fly Away\" blares from the stereo... \nWHIP emerges from the cockpit. He's still in his suit but with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up. He's energized like an excited kid. He runs up and kisses her. \nNICOLE notes the cloud of smoke hanging in the air and the burning cigarette in the ashtray, empty beers. \nWHIP Looks great right? \nNICOLE It's kind of...beautiful. \nWHIP wipes at his nose. \nWHIP It's a Cessna 172, it was my dad's. He kept it perfect. \nNICOLE takes in this cool trinket of aviation history. \nNICOLE Does it work... \nWHIP Yeah, he flew this plane a few months before he died. I learned to fly in this plane. You can land it anywhere. \nWHIP laughs, remembering... \nWHIP (CONT'D) My friend Harling and I flew it to Jamaica. \nNICOLE Jamaica? In this? \nWHIP We set off for an overnight fishing trip two hours south of here. We ended up in Bethel, Jamaica. \nNICOLE You're insane. \nWHIP It was like a picture on a post card. The white sand and sky blue water. Most beautiful place I've ever been. \nNICOLE Was the water warm? \nWHIP Yeah, really warm. \nNICOLE That's my kind of place. \nWHIP Let's go. \nNICOLE Sure, why not. \nNICOLE laughs thinking they're playing a game. \nWHIP Let's go tomorrow. \nNICOLE You're serious? \nWHIP We'll leave in the morning...we'll just go. Start over. \nNICOLE realizes he's serious as he opens another beer. \nNICOLE Whip, we can't. \nWHIP It's a beautiful beach, it's paradise. \nNICOLE I'm worried about you. \n", "test2_true": "NICOLE No you're not, you're really not. You need help, Whip. I think you need rehab. \nWHIP You go to a couple of AA meetings and all of a sudden you think you're Jesus Christ?

And don't give me a whole... \nNICOLE Never Whip, I never in my life- \nWHIP Your mom died and dad drank and bullshit, bullshit, bullshit -- \nNICOLE Stop. Please stop. \nWHIP Is that why you shot dope? \nNICOLE That's not fair- \nWHIP Well there's a lot of people out there who lost their mom who've never had a drink in their life. \nNICOLE You're sick, Whip. \nNICOLE walks away, leaving WHIP with his plane and his dream of freedom. WHIP calls after her. \nWHIP I choose to drink. \nNICOLE Do you? You choose it? I don't see a lot of choice goin' on. \nWHIP I choose to drink! And I blame it on me. I'm happy to. I've got an ex-wife and a son I don't see. Why? Because I choose to drink! \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nWe follow WHIP as he enters the house and approaches the doorway of the bedroom. WHIP sees NICOLE sitting on the bed. She quickly tucks her cell phone away as WHIP holds up his hand to signal a truce. \nWHIP Alright look, I was loaded when I crashed that plane. With this investigation going on, I don't know what's gonna happen. Come to Jamaica with me. \nNICOLE Whip. I'm afraid I'll use again. \nWHIP Come with me. I need help, I do. \nNICOLE I'd love for you to get help, Whip. \nWHIP When we get to Jamaica we can go to the local hospital. I'll do it for you. Anything you want. \nNICOLE looks at the sincere love in his eyes. \nNICOLE I don't wanna use again. I can't. I won't make it back. \nWHIP I'll be sober. I won't force you to stay. I promise if you don't like it or if I don't clean up? You can leave. \nThis is the most sincere plea she's ever heard. \nWHIP (CONT'D) It's so beautiful there. We'll leave before noon. I'm a great pilot. You'll get to see so much. \nWHIP wraps his arms around her. We stay on NICOLE's face as he holds her tighter and tighter. \nINT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING \nNICOLE is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table. Past NICOLE we can see WHIP lying in bed. \nShe has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at her feet. She finishes a handwritten note and places it down. NICOLE picks up the note and begins to reread it. \nShe hears a car in the driveway -- she picks up her stuff and takes one last look at the sleeping WHIP. She leaves, careful not to make a sound. \nEXT. WHITAKER FARM -- FRONT DOOR -- EARLY MORNING \nNICOLE quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her stuff. She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as she makes her way to SHEILA's car that we see parked at the top of the driveway, far from the house. \nINT. WHITAKER RANCH -- BEDROOM -- LATER SAME DAY \nWHIP stirs, wakes up and looks around. WHIP walks around looking for NICOLE. He finds the note and reads it. The reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the window and stares out at the barn. \nWHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big book of AA on the table near where the letter was left. WHIP picks it up and throws it across the room. He then grabs the back of a chair and tosses it against the wall. \nAfter wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall. The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his son. \nWe hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE. WHIP relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him. \nWhip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is answered by the old machine... \nWHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides. Please leave a message and it will be returned. Thank you. \nThe beep concludes... \nCHARLIE (speaking to voice mail) Hey Whip, if you're there pickup...I got some good news... \nWHIP snatches the phone of the hook. \nWHIP Yeah, I'm here. What's goin' on? \n104 WHIP listens as CHARLIE talks... 104 \nEXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY \nWHIP sits in his car. Rain pounds the windshield as we watch him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice. WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink. \nWHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and stowing it in the glove box. WHIP gets out and we watch him walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar. A SECURITY GUARD meets him and takes him inside. \n", "test2_id": 2611, "test3_input": "Sit stone faced in the second row feeling the relief of months of hard work. \nELLEN BLOCK continues with a rote posture... \nELLEN BLOCK On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job? \nWHIP No. I did not. \nELLEN wraps up this line of questions... \nELLEN BLOCK Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction? \nWHIP waits for her to look at him...this takes a while... \nWHIP No. \nHUGH maintains a poker face; CHARLIE appears relieved. \nELLEN sorts through her notes one last time. \nELLEN BLOCK Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done. (She refers to her notes) Due to the severe turbulence during the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane. Is that correct? \nWHIP Yes. I suspended the drink service. \nELLEN BLOCK Are you aware that our investigators found two single- service Vodka bottles in the galley trash bin? \nSlides now show the TWO SMALL VODKA BOTTLES in evidence. \nWHIP Yes. \nELLEN BLOCK There were 5 crew members on board the flight who would have had access to the beverage trolley. Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of the crew members. Yourself... \nA SOUTHJET CORPORATE PHOTO OF WHIP pops on to the large monitors. After ELLEN references a member of the flight crew, their photo pops on to the monitors... \nELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) First Officer Evans, flight attendant Margaret Thomason and posthumously from Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. \nKATERINA MARQUEZ PHOTO does not pop up on the screen...yet. \nELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) A toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative, one was disqualified for technical reasons... \nHugh smiles -- satisfied. \nELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) And one tested positive for alcohol. It registered a .17 blood alcohol level. Are you aware of that? \nWHIP I am now. \nELLEN BLOCK Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work? Correct? \nWHIP Outside of work? Not really. \nELLEN BLOCK Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem? \nWHIP No. I did not. \nELLEN BLOCK Did you ever see her drink to excess? \nWHIP No. I did not. \nELLEN BLOCK Did you know that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction? The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines? \nWHIP No. I did not. \nA picture of Trina's beautiful smiling face FLASHES UP ON THE BIG SCREEN. \nELLEN BLOCK Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank the vodka on the plane? \nWHIP smiles at the photo of TRINA as if she can see him. He then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great spirit. He gets serious as he bears his look down on ELLEN. \nWHIP Can you repeat the question? \nELLEN BLOCK Your opinion Captain. Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? \nWhip shakes. He runs his trembling hand through his hair. \nWHIP I'm sorry. My what... \nELLEN BLOCK Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissable in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those 2 bottles of vodka on the flight? \nWhip drops his head and MUTTERS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE. \nELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) I'm sorry Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't hear you. What did you say? \nWHIP I SAID...God help me... \nA confused MUMBLE rises in the room. Whip's response flusters ELLEN for a moment, but she recovers quickly. \nELLEN BLOCK Yes, well. However, is it your opinion... \nWhip cuts her off... \nWHIP (EXCESSIVELY LOUD) IT'S MY OPINION... (lowers his voice) It's my opinion... Trina DID NOT...drink the vodka. \nELLEN BLOCK Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker... \nWHIP (softly, to himself) She saved that boy's life... \nELLEN BLOCK Captain Whitaker can you speak LOUDER- \nWHIP (LOUD AGAIN) I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE DID NOT DRINK THAT VODKA... \nWhip stops. His whole body trembles, his face tightens. He looks right at ELLEN... \n", "test3_true": "The crowd gasps, unsure of what they just heard... \nCHARLIE rockets out of his chair. \nCHARLIE OBJECTION!!! \nNTSB OFFICER #2 Please be seated sir. This is not a court room. \nNow CHARLIE returns to his chair to find that HUGH is gone. CHARLIE looks around for HUGH, no sign. He's vanished. \nWHIP leans close to the microphone. \nWHIP I drank the vodka bottles on the plane. \nELLEN BLOCK Mr. Whitaker, in light of that remark, would you like to readdress... \nWHIP You don't have to readdress anything. I DRANK THE VODKA! \nELLEN BLOCK On the three nights before the accident, October 11th- \nWHIP On October 11th, 12th and 13th and 14th I was intoxicated. I drank alcohol on all of those days. I drank to excess. \nChaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY. Flash bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee. \nELLEN BLOCK Mr. Whitaker, on the morning of OCTOBER- \nWHIP I was drunk. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block...I'm drunk right... (Whip finally breaks down) I'm drunk now, because... Because I'm an alcoholic. \nWe have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound in the room fades away. We stay tight on WHIP's face as he lets the moments unfold. \nSuddenly the noise cuts to silence. WHIP is looking at the assembly. WHIP wipes tears from his eyes. We hear WHIP's voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face. \nWHIP (V.O.) That was it...I was done. It's as if I'd hit my life long limit for lies. \nA new angle shows WHIP speaking these words... \nWHIP I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I had just told one more lie? I could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly I would have avoided being locked up here with all of you nice folks for the last 13 months. \nWe hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA meeting in a Federal Prison. \nWHIP (CONT'D) It looks like I will serve every day of the remaining 4 plus years of my sentence. And that's fair. I betrayed the public trust. I did. That's what the judge explained to me. I had betrayed the public trust. The FAA took my license. And that's fair. The chances of me flying again are slim to none. And I accept that. \nINT. MCRAE FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GEORGIA -- DAY \nA large room houses an AA meeting for about 50 inmates wearing white jumpsuits. WHIP continues his story. \nWHIP I've had time to think about all of it. Doing a lot of writing. I've written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight. Some were able to hear my apology, some never will. I've also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen, like my wife, I mean my ex wife... (he gets emotional) ...and my son. Again, some were able to forgive me...some never will. (COLLECTS HIMSELF) But at least I'm sober, and I'm grateful for that. \nWhip gives it to us straight... \nWHIP (CONT'D) And this is gonna sound really stupid coming from a man who's in prison...but for the first time in my life...I'm free. \nWe hold close on WHIP's face as we hear the metallic clang of prison doors shutting. On the sound we cut to... \nINT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- CELL -- DAY \nWe pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small, personal photo collage. We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison. We see a photo of WHIP's DAD as an airman. We ultimately land on a photo of NICOLE. We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on the porch of the Whitaker Farm. \nWe pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal. A GUARD comes to the front of his cell. \nGUARD Whitaker, you got a visitor. \nWHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance at the photo of NICOLE. \nEXT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GUEST YARD -- DAY \nWHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed courtyard. He checks his watch and looks up. \nWHIP stands and walks towards us, towards his visitor. As he gets closer we see a smile break across his face. A smile we haven't seen since he first saw NICOLE. We reverse to see... \nWILL -- WHIP's 17 year old son stands next to a GUARD. \nGUARD You have 40 minutes. \nWHIP Knuckles, you're looking good. (BEAT) I sent you something for your birthday. \nWILL Yeah. I got it. \nAnother beat as they can't find a way in to a conversation. \nWHIP This is a real surprise; a great surprise. I haven't seen you- \nWHIP chokes up. WILL nods. It's intense. WHIP motions to the table and they both sit. WILL pulls out a notebook. \nWILL College counselor thought I should come and interview you. \nWHIP Great. An interview. Okay. \nWILL I'm writing essays for college applications. \nWHIP studies him and laughs...WILL nods and tries to smile. \nWHIP Listen Will, it means everything to me that you came here. You are an amazing kid and you deserve great things... \nAgain WHIP has to tamp down his emotions. \nWILL So can you help me with this essay? \nWHIP Yeah. Of course. \nWILL pulls out a small voice recorder and clicks it on... \n", "test3_id": 2612}

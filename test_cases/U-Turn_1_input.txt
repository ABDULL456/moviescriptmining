SHERIFF (hurt) Oh Grace, you can say what you want...but, I watched you fuck that pervert for years while you're telling me you loved me? What happened to going to Milwaukee together? You and me -- gonna open up the finest sporting goods store that city ever did see? Get us a place on the north shore, by the lake? Season Brewer tickets! Just you and me, Grace. What happened? 
GRACE All talk, that's all you did was talk, and all I did was sit around getting older waiting for you to free me! You never did nothin' Virgil, you're weak! (pointing to Bobby) He did! 
The Sheriff, deeply wounded, casts a hot vicious gaze on Bobby. 
SHERIFF This is some girl you and me got here Bobby, yessir, an excellent cocksuck too, wouldn't you say? (back at Grace)... Course you had a lotta practice haven't you darling, going way back to your crazy mama! 
GRACE (deadly) Shut up, Virgil! Take your share of the money. It's not so bad. 
SHERIFF I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's you. You Grace or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife...(hopeful). What do you way Grace? 
GRACE You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you. 
Bobby gets out of the car, misunderstanding the situation. 
BOBBY (misunderstanding) Look, we got more. We got $200,000 at least. Split it three ways, we all walk away... 
The Sheriff snaps and smashes Bobby with his flashlight, knocking him to the ground, kicking him again and again, gathering the psychic force to murder him. Grace tries to approach. 
SHERIFF Shut up, boy! You don't know shit round here! (to Grace) Get back. Did she tell you that story about the bird flying away? 
BOBBY (rolling on the ground) Ow! Look, I ... ow! 
GRACE Stop! Stop it! 
SHERIFF (kicking again and again) Were you going to help her fly away, asshole? What'd you think, you were the first boy to drift through this town she came on to? She tell you the story about old Jake forcing her to marry him? That's a good story... How he killed her crazy Mama? 
Bobby in bloody agony. Grace stunned that Virgil would reveal this now publicly. 
GRACE Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't! 
SHERIFF ...But I bet the story she didn't tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake was really her Papa. And she liked fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you! 
Grace plunges into the pack, pulls the gun and shoots Virgil across the car in the gut. 
GRACE No...you! You! 
The Sheriff flies back onto the road, stunned, not realizing what's happened. 
Bobby watches unbelieving as Grace quietly steps up over the Sheriff. 
She puts the next round in his nuts, a modern fury enacting ancient wrath. 
BOBBY Grace. No! 
The Sheriff is wide-eyed, dying in shock. Grace then fires right at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the back of his head. 
Grace and Bobby both stare, then Grace jumps into action, dragging the body. She snaps to Bobby. 
GRACE Help me get him off the road. Into the car! We'll ditch his car... Get the fuck up! 
Bobby stares at her. 
EXT./INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT 
They're driving. GRACE and BOBBY, wordless, each thinking in separate worlds. Grace wipes her hands. The bag with the money between her legs. The Baretta is back in the bag. 
BOBBY (finally) Jesus, did you have to kill him? 
GRACE Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me. 
BOBBY He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ... 
GRACE The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks. 
BOBBY He was a cop, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop... 
GRACE He was a scumbag!... He wanted me, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're dead... (softer) You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same. 
A silence. The oncoming road. 
GRACE So, aren't you going to ask me? 
BOBBY Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next? 
GRACE Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now? 
BOBBY Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past... 
GRACE Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that? 
BOBBY (shouting) What do you want me to say!

77 | P a g e (cont'd) an incident that killed a close colleague of hers and resulted in Shona being pensioned, invalided out of the army. In your opinion Chris, this - the PTSD - should have been crucial to the decision not to prosecute Shona for murder, a charge you now feel should have been reduced to what: manslaughter? She didn't seem like much of an invalid in the way she dealt with Rounds did she? So for you - was this a travesty of justice? Really? 
MARLOW VO My sense of it is, Christie, as I've said, and the reason I feel I failed, really, is that the state must find a way to take responsibility. 
The hoodie climbs over the back fence of a house. He then proceeds up the garden ­ again hugging the shadows for cover. 
FEMALE DJ VO But now you're considering retiring? With a future as QC certain. A Law Lord perhaps. You're regarded by many as a (laughs) legal wunderkind! 
MARLOW VO Well I don't know about that. But yes, I'm looking to move out of the legal profession now. 
FEMALE DJ VO Because of this case, specifically? As Queens Council you could help people like Shona. Lots of Shonas. 
MARLOW I know. But look. For me it's this: we send her out to Afghanistan. We tell her to kill people who resisted our invasion. (as the DJ starts to speak) But (more) 
78 | P a g e (cont'd) anyway ­ look: we make her an expert. A killing machine. And then war breaks our machine. So then our machine needs Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder drugs in order to function in normal life. To make a cup of tea, for God sake. (silence a beat, then) She's a broken child, Chrissie. We broke her. So then when she kills a known psychotic child molester and murderer in her home in the middle of the night ­ in her home - in self-defence ­ we, the state, we call that murder, and we throw her to the dogs. We screw her up in the name of a cause in some country some people - and lets' face it, in a part of the world not many British people know or give a damn about - and then we finish the job. We prosecute her for murder and lock her up. 
The hoodie chooses a ground floor window. He jemmies it open. 
FEMALE DJ VO But ultimately the only alternative is that we don't have a professional, a standing army. We rely on . . . 
MARLOW VO I understand. I understand that when you sign up, you take your chances. You become an organ of the state, and if that state tells you to kill people in its name, it chooses not to call that murder. It chooses then to call you a hero ­ especially if you die. 
FEMALE DJ VO So these young people, the soldiers who give their lives in the defence of our liberty (more) 
79 | P a g e (cont'd) don't deserve the label hero. Is that what you're saying? 
The hoodie climbs through the window he has jemmied open. 
MARLOW VO Nation states have always protected themselves from their own imperial absurdities. What would be left if there was no chance of glory? Why would anyone sign up? Look: in war, anywhere, people do what they can to survive. All I can say is that personally, I mean as Shona's brief, I failed to make the court see sense. For me, you know, it's like you can murder in the so called defence of the state but if you kill in the defence of yourself . . .You know it's like, I mean as Shakespeare said `if his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.'

CUT TO 
5.114 INT. SHONA'S HOME, BEDROOM ­ NIGHT 
SHONA (20s, black) is awoken by a sound ­ the dull clunk of something giving under strain. She lifts her head up, listens. 
Another clunk, but this followed by other sounds downstairs. 
Shona is quickly out of bed, standing. She moves in a way that suggests combat training: with controlled power and assurance. 
She is not afraid. 
5.115 INT. SHONA'S HOME, KITCHEN - NIGHT 
CALEB (20s, white) breaks in through the kitchen window. He's young and hooded. His thin face is haunted by addiction. 
Caleb climbs through the window he has just jemmied open. He stands in the kitchen a moment, listening. He hears nothing. 
80 | P a g e He starts to move quietly through the kitchen towards the 
5.116 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Caleb enters. He looks around, sees the usual living room stuff: a settee, some ornaments, a TV and iPod and iPod dock; a shelf bearing a few ornaments ­ OK, but Caleb wants more. 
What Caleb doesn't seem to see are the mantelpiece photos of Corporal Shona smiling with her Para mates in Afghanistan. 
Caleb turns and heads towards the door. He goes out into the 
5.117 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Caleb emerges from the living room. 
CRACK 
A fist connects with his jaw, sending him staggering. 
CRACK, CRACK 
Another two blows ­ a fist and a kick. Caleb sprawls, and then manages to stand as Shona attacks him. She moves fast and with focus ­ a shape in the darkness moving very fast. Caleb lashes out with his right fist. He misses. She lands another two punches to his neck and face. He yells and lashes out again. This time he connects with the side of her head. She goes sprawling. He dives towards her and pounds her with his fists. 
CALEB What the fuck ­ easy-peasy, ho! 
She fights him: the focussed power of a trained soldier; but he's too strong and doesn't seem to feel blows that should be causing him a lot of pain. He PUNCHES her in the head twice.

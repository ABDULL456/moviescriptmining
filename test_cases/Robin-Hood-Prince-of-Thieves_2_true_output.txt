CONTINUED: FRIAR How can these Arabs hold Jerusalem when they can't even hold their brew? DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. FOREST LANE - DAWN A masked soldier gallops along.    Hurls a bundle to the ground. 
EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAWN 
The Friar and the Saracen lie head to head on the dewey grass. Tuck  snores. Robin shakes Aslan, who grabs for his weapon.  The hangover hits him like a mallet. He clutches his temples. ROBIN The dancing demon! Good morning. ASLAN (wincing) If it was Jehovah who created this brew, he is truly wise. He built the punishment into the crime. An ARROW WHISTLES into a tree.    Robin reacts. ROBIN They need help. 
EXT. FOREST LANE - DAY Bull and Hal are crouched in the roadway, over a body. Robin runs up with Aslan. He kneels beside them. The body is Duncan. Robin clasps a dead hand... Silence. Fighting his emotions. BULL A bloke wearin' a mask o' the Druids rode by. Tossed 'im down. ROBIN Are you sure it was a Druid mask? (as Bull nods) Damn them to hell! They must have Marian. Do you know where they meet? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BULL The Gregor Caves, I 'eard tell. ASLAN We will go there. ROBIN No! You stay here, dammit!    I will go alone. ASLAN You forget yourself.   I am not your servant. ROBIN Then be my friend. There are women and children here in greater need of your courage. ASLAN (considers) Take my eyes, then. He hands Robin his telescope. CUT TO: 
EXT. CAVES SQUAWKING ominously, CROWS burst from the trees. Robin rides up the path to the caves that his father took. Checks the ground. Horse tracks. He dismounts, moves cautiously forward. 
POV THROUGH SCOPE - CIRCLE OF STONES No one visible. Debris. Smoke rises from ashes. Remnants of a recent ceremony. 
BACK TO SCENE Robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone circle. There is blood on the sacrificial altar. Through the opening of the cave, he spies a woman's form, lying face down. ROBIN (under his breath) Marian! (CONTINUED)

...a drummer takes a wild solo. Enraptured, Allen taps his fingers to these new rhythms. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY 
Allen's fingers typing in these same rhythms. Beside, The New Yorker advertising Ogden Nash's upcoming reading. 
LUCIEN (O.S.) Extraordinary men propel society forward. It is our duty to break the law. 
INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY 
Allen stopping Lucien in his tracks. 
ALLEN Really? 
LUCIEN It's how we make the world wider. 
Allen considers, agrees. 
ALLEN You are an extraordinary man. 
Lucien beams. 
LUCIEN Well, thank you. 
INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - AN HOUR LATER 
Bill at David's bookcase, removing classic art and literature books and throwing them to Allen. 
BILL (O.S.) "Return of the Native." "Leviathan." Tear `em up boys. Destroy the old and build the new! 
Allen, with scissors, cuts up pages of the books. Hands them to Lucien who nails them to the wall. 
It's a frantic assembly-line: Bill whips books to Allen, Allen tears out sections, and Lucien hammers them up. 
We PULL BACK to see the entire wall is covered in words. 
INT. HARLEM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
Time suddenly slows. The music tapers, the hands of the drummer taper down to a still. Allen looks around, scared and confused. What is happening? 
A spotlight cuts through the room, capturing the singer's sweaty ecstasy, the bassist's fingers mid-plucking. The room freezes. 
Unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, Allen turns to Bill. 
Bill holds up his finger - it is on fire. He lights Allen's cigarette with the flame. We have entered into another universe. 
Lucien stands -- the only thing moving -- and Allen follows. He steps into the frozen moment. And it's beautiful. 
LUCIEN Watch this. 
Lucien leans over a young woman, a statue at a table with a young man in military attire. 
LUCIEN (whispered in her ear) Go. 
The girl comes to life and clambers over the young man to a second, more attractive soldier. And kisses him. The pair erupt into life, into desire. 
Lucien and Allen sit on the stage beneath the frozen musicians. Lucien pulls out a BOY SCOUT KNIFE. 
Wraps Allen's hand in a fist around the blade. 
He pulls the knife free. Allen winces in pain. 
Lucien does the same to his own palm, then presses their two bloody hands together. A ceremony. Allen's eyes roll back. 
David appears in a janitor uniform. The Technicolor fades. 
DAVID What the hell is this? 
CUT TO: 
INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Allen, the nitrous oxide mask over his face inhaling from a tank of gas. He has been adrift in a hallucination. 
Lucien presses Allen's hand back and forth, both unharmed. 
BILL Time slows down as you drift deeper and deeper into your cave...

THE STREET CORNER / ASHTON PARADE 
A smoking Don Price crushes his cigarette as Edward leaves town. 
BACK TO: 
EXT/INT. SORORITY HOUSE - THE DOORWAY 
Edward is dumbstruck. With all the strength he can muster... 
EDWARD Well. Congratulations. I'm sorry to have bothered you. 
He turns and walks down the front steps. 
She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely horrible for what's happened. But eventually she goes back inside. We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters get to the bottom of this. 
SANDRA Stop it. It's not funny. That poor boy. 
We LEAD Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form. 
EDWARD (V.O.) Fate has a cruel way of circling around on you. After all this work to leave Ashton, the girl I loved was now engaged to one of its biggest jerks. 
He EXITS FRAME, leaving only the sorority house in the background. 
EDWARD (V.O.) There's a time when a man needs to fight, and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost, that the ship has sailed, and that only a fool would continue. 
A beat. Edward steps back INTO FRAME, looking at the sorority house. 
EDWARD (V.O.) The truth is, I've always been a fool. 
We CIRCLE as he shouts: 
EDWARD Sandra Templeton! I love you! And I am going to marry you! 
INT. SORORITY HOUSE FOYER - DAY 
Sandra and her SISTERS peer out through the curtains. Is this guy crazy? 
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY 
The tweedy ECONOMICS PROFESSOR continues his explanation. Sandra isn't paying a lot of attention. 
He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it. There's a TITTER from the STUDENTS, but he doesn't notice. 
A classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up. Written on the projector is "I Love Sandra Templeton." She's horrified and excited at the same time. The professor finally notices what's written there. 
EXT. QUAD - DAY 
Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving. We look up to the blue sky, where a giant sky-written heart floats in the wind. 
INT. SANDRA'S BEDROOM - [THE NEXT] MORNING 
At her Sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the second-story window to find the lawn filled with 
TEN THOUSAND DAFFODILS. 
Edward stands amid the sea of flowers. He's waited there six hours. 
EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY 
Sandra walks out to him. She's smiling, confused, joyful and scared. All down Greek Street, STUDENTS are coming out to see the display. 
SANDRA Daffodils? 
EDWARD They're your favorite flower. 
SANDRA How did you get so many? 
EDWARD I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me. 
Out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra's cheek. She wipes it off. 
SANDRA You don't even know me. 
EDWARD I have the rest of my life to find out. 
From down the street... 
A MAN'S VOICE Sandra! 
SANDRA It's Don. Promise me you won't hurt him. 
EDWARD If that's what you want, I swear to it. 
The adult DON PRICE arrives. He's 230 pounds of football- playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle. And he's pissed. 
A gang of his BROTHERS walk behind him. 
DON PRICE Bloom! 
EDWARD Don.

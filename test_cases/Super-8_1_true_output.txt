And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure: 
ALICE Was that okay? Or... not really? 
Charles is stunned -- almost crying -- can't talk -- and as he searches, behind him, a LIGHT -- 
CHARLES -- uh, that was... I'm... that-- yeah, good. Just like that. 
Then a distant AIRHORN -- Charles looks: AN ONCOMING TRAIN. PUSH IN ON CHARLES, TIGHT. He turns to them all: 
CHARLES (CONT'D) PRODUCTION VALUE!!! Is there film in the camera?! 
CARY -- I didn't put it in-- 
CHARLES PUT IT IN!!! PUT IT IN!!! Joe, get the mike ready. Go, go, Preston, get in position. Costume, costume. Martin, get that tripod set up. Joe, help her with her costume. Hurry, hurry! Go! I hope we don't miss the train. Preston, get in position! Martin, you know you lines, right?! IS THE FILM IN THE CAMERA YET?! 
As Charles runs to Alice, takes her script pages. 
ALICE I love how calm he is. 
JOE Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy. 
Joe laughs a little as he goes -- Cary RIPS OPEN a YELLOW SUPER 8 box -- Joe grabs the mike -- Cary INSERTS the film: CLICK! Joe plugs in the mike, Charles grabs the camera: 
CHARLES Everyone ready...?! Be extra loud when the train passes by! Oh God, I hope it stops! You ready?! 
They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in her background -- Charles puts on the headphones -- 
CHARLES (CONT'D) And... ACTION! 
And they're shooting: 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY I'm going to stay here and investigate. I think it would be safer if you left town for a couple of days. 
MRS. HATHAWAY John. I don't like it. This case. These murders. 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you? 
MRS. HATHAWAY Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year. 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY Sweetheart. This is my job. 
Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom, looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the train is APPROACHING -- GETTING LOUDER -- which makes Joe turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them -- LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the GROWING DIN: 
MRS. HATHAWAY THE DEAD, COMING BACK TO LIFE?! I THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER! 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY I HAVE NO CHOICE!!! 
MRS. HATHAWAY YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE! WE ALL DO!!! John, I've never asked you to stop. I've never asked you to give up or walk away. 
Joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS. PUSH IN ON JOE, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Joe looks back toward Alice -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD! 
MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) But I'm asking you now-- please. For me. Don't go back. Don't leave me. I need to know this isn't the last time I'll see you. (BEAT) I just love you so much. 
Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines -- Charles is almost LAUGHING at how good this looks -- but Joe LOOKS DESPERATELY BACK toward the headlights -- the train LIGHTING UP THE OLD PICK-UP THAT IS ABOUT TO CRASH INTO THE TRAIN! 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY I love you too!! 
And Joe finally swings the mike down and YELLS: 
JOE CHARLES GUYS, WATCH OUT!!! Joe what the hell are y--?! 
-- just then BA-BA-BA-BAM!!! THE TRAIN ENGINE, HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY, SLAMS INTO THE TRUCK -- THE KIDS GASP -- REACT -- AS THE TRAIN ENGINE DERAILS! 
JOE Run! 
THE TRAIN BEGINS TO CRASH -- ACCORDION -- THE KIDS SCREAM -- RUN -- ENTIRE 50-TON CARS JACKNIFE AND CRASH UPWARD -- FLYING VERTICAL -- CHARLES' SUPER 8 CAMERA AND TRIPOD SLAM ONTO THE PLATFORM, LANDING SIDEWAYS, STILL FILMING as the CRASH WAVE APPROACHES AND PASSES THEM! 
THE KIDS SCATTER, PRESTON AND MARTIN RUN ONE WAY. CHARLES, CARY AND JOE RUN ANOTHER. JOE STOPS AS ALICE RUNS AROUND THE BUILDING. 
JOE (CONT'D) Alice! 
CHARLES Joe, we have to go. 
They run off. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!! 
AS NEARBY CARS RIP OFF TRACKS, TUMBLE -- CARS FROM FATHER BACK JETTISON TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO THE DEPOT, SHATTERING IT -- THE ENTIRE AREA IS DECIMATED IN AN INSTANT! And then -- 
IT'S OVER. Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH- SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.

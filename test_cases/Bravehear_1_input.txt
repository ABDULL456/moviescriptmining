Once again the boy stands in the doorway of the barn, looking at the garish, hanged faces in his nightmare. Then a mangled hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder, William gasps, but the hand holds him gently. He turns to see his father, and his brother! They are wounded, bloody, but they smile at him; they're alive! Weeping in joy, William reaches to hug them, but his father stretches forth a forbidding hand. 
William keeps reaching out helplessly. His father and brother move past him to the hanged knights. Two empty nooses are there. Before the boy's weeping eyes they put their heads into the nooses, and hoist themselves up. 
William's grief explodes; his tears erupt and 
HE WAKES IN HIS BEDROOM 
tears flooding down his face. A dream! Still upset, still grieving, he gets up and goes looking for his uncle. 
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT 
William moves down to the room where his uncle would be sleeping. He opens the door. The bed has been slept in -- but his uncle is not there. He moves downstairs to 
THE KITCHEN 
But his uncle is not there either. Then William hears a strange, haunting sound-distant, carried by the wind. He moves to the window and sees only moonlight. He opens the window and hears it more clearly: bagpipes. William lights a candle and throws open the door. Wind rushes in, blowing out his candle. But he hears the pipes, louder in the wind. 
EXT. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT 
William is barefoot and in only his nightshirt; but the sound of the pipes is growing louder. He moves through the moonlight, drawn toward -- the graveyard! He stops as he realizes this, then forces himself on. 
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
William moves to the top of the hill where his ancestors are buried, and discovers a haunting scene: two dozen men, the farmer/warriors of his neighborhood, are gathered in kilts -- and among them, a core of bagpipers. The pipes wail an ancient Scottish dirge, a tune of grief and redemption, a melody known to us as "Amazing Grace." Uncle Argyle has heard them and walked out too; he stands at the fringes of the torchlight, still holding the massive broadsword. He glances down, noticing William as the boy moves up beside him. William whispers... 
WILLIAM What are they doing? 
ARGYLE Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes. 
The farmers file by the graveside, crossing themselves, each whispering his own private prayer. Argyle whispers, half to William, and half to himself... 
ARGYLE Your Daddy and I, we saw our own father buried like this, dead from fighting the English. 
William takes the sword from his uncle, and tries to lift it. 
Slowly, Argyle takes the sword back. 
ARGYLE First learn to use this. 
He taps William on the temple with the tip of his finger. 
ARGYLE Then I will teach you to use this. 
With an expert's easy fluidity, he lifts the huge sword. It glistens in the torchlight. The music plays, the notes hanging in the air, swirling in the Scottish breeze as if rising towards the stars... 
EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY 
William and his uncle ride off in a farm wagon. William has a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back. But he does glance back just once, to see the deserted farmhouse. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - ROYAL WEDDING - DAY 
Amid the scarlet and ermine robes of officiating lords, with gemstones sparkling everywhere, we hear... 
VOICE OVER Twelve years later, Longshanks supervised the wedding of his eldest son, also named Edward, who would succeed him to the throne. 
LONGSHANKS, King of England, stands in the jeweled light of the ancient Abbey. Known as Longshanks because of the spindly legs that make him almost seven feet tall, he has a hawk's nose and a snake's eyes, punctuating a face of distinct cruelty. Historians of his day considered him and the line of Plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers. 
VOICE OVER As bride for his son, Longshanks had chosen a relative of his rival, the king of France. 
GENEVIEVE, a nineteen-year-old virgin of stupendous beauty moves down the aisle, the light in her face outshining her blindingly white wedding gown. As she reaches the altar her hands tremble, but she maintains her poise and control. 
She looks toward EDWARD, Prince of Wales. Pampered young men surround him as his retinue. He takes her hand coldly and goes through the ceremony under his father's stare. 
VOICE OVER It was widely whispered that for the Princess to conceive, Longshanks would have to do the honors himself. That may have been what he had in mind all along. 
The ceremony concluding, attendants lift back the bride's veil. Her wedding day, the ultimate moment -- and Prince Edward ignores her, to turn back to his friends. But prompted by one of the sour lords, he leans over and pecks his new Princess on the cheek. For an instant, we see in her eyes that her heart is dying. But she keeps her poise. 
VOICE OVER Having seen to his obligations to provide for a successor, Longshanks set about his fondest business -- to crush Scotland, and turn his power against France...

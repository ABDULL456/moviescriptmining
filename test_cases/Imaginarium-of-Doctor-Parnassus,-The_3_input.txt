The horses are standing steaming nearby. 
DR. PARNASSUS (very down) I know... It's over....you've won... 
MR NICK Four rotten Russkies? 
DR. PARNASSUS And the girl..from the pub. 
MR NICK shakes his head. 
MR NICK Sally doesn't count.    Do you, gal? 
SALLY (the woman thrown out from the wagon as they escaped from the pub mob) steps out of the shadows, puts her arms around NICK 
DR. PARNASSUS You're joking... toying with me. Like a cat with a mouse... As is your privilege. 
MR NICK Sal didn't get to make a real choice. You were gaga. Out for the count. Wouldn't be fair...And you've got four, thanks to your friend Tony. So... we're even... it's not quite over. 
He smiles, lights a cigarette, takes a deep drag... 
MR NICK (CONT'D) Not quite. (checks his watch) Oh,oh, look at the time...it's 11.

59   CONTINUED:                                               59 
...and he wanders off into the darkness with SALLY. Somewhere, a clock strikes 11. 
DR. PARNASSUS, agitated, watches him go. 
VALENTINA (V.O.) Father? 
DR. PARNASSUS looks round to find VALENTINA standing next to him. He starts to round up the horses. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Valentina... my darling girl. We must do another show! Now! Quickly! Get ready to move out! 
VALENTINA Who was that? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Somebody asking the way. Where's Tony? 
VALENTINA I overheard you... He wasn't asking the way. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Please! Get everybody together. Another show! Tony! Percy! 
VALENTINA I want to know what's going on. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (harnessing the horses) Not now. 
VALENTINA Yes, now! I want to know the truth! 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS The truth? 
VALENTINA What are you hiding? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS There are more important things, at this moment! 
(CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED: (2)                                           59 
VALENTINA It's something to do with that bloody rambling story you were telling me the night we found Tony isn't it? 
PARNASSUS sighs. Stops. He checks his watch 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Yes. 
VALENTINA So tell me. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS What I told you was... the truth. I really am thousands of years old. I have been immortal. I have been mortal. And I have had many dealings with the devil. Too many. 
VALENTINA (fearful) What are you saying?... 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Remember the woman I was telling you about?.. the one I was so desperately in love with.. so in love that I made a deal with the devil? That was your mother... ...she was so beautiful, so enchanting...so... 
Looking at VALENTINA, DR. PARNASSUS sees her morph into the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN appearing. He almost swoons. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) ... so young. She was everything I had ever dreamed of. I made a choice. I bargained away my immortality. I regained my youth... and I won her. I did! I won her...! 
The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN morphs back into VALENTINA. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) ...but at a price... 
DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and loses his balance. 
(CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED: (3)                                       59 
VALENTINA stops him from falling. 
VALENTINA What price? 
DR. PARNASSUS (anguished) It's too terrible... 
VALENTINA Tell me...

Maude walks stiffly into room behind him, eyes staring blankly. \nZEKE (without looking up) Everythin' okay out there, Maude? \nWAIST SHOT -- MAUDE \nShe stares with glassy, red eyes and CLUCKS quietly. \nMAUDE-CHICKEN (CLUCKS) \nZEKE (VO) What say? \nPAN DOWN below Maude's waist to reveal that she's turning into a chicken from the feet up.  First her shoes RIP apart as large, yellow chicken feet sprout.  Then her dress SWELLS and SPLITS, revealing a large, feathered body underneath. The only piece of clothing left on her is her apron.  One foot scratches the floor. \nMAUDE-CHICKEN (VO) (more CLUCKS) \nWIDER ANGLE -- FULLSHOT OF MAUDE-CHICKEN \nNow completely transformed and six feet tall, she leaps up to perch on back of couch, THRUSTING her chicken head repeatedly into the popcorn bowl in Zeke's lap, pecking the bowl clean.  Zeke's jaw hangs open, speechless, as he stares at the fanged, drooling, six-foot Werechicken.

He finally dives right into it. \nPETER (CONT) It's Your night to take out the trash. \nRAY And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes. \nANGLE ON EGON \nHe's busy testing his WEATHER BALLOON--a large, pink bubble half the size of the room.

{"train": "THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS \"Poultrygeist!\" \nby Duane Capizzi and Steven Roberts \nLast revised May 12, 1988 \nACT ONE FADE IN: \nEXT. -- A FARMHOUSE OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT \nOn the farmhouse roof a CHICKEN-SHAPED WEATHERVANE stands silhouetted against a FULL, BLOOD-RED MOON.  The wind HOWLS and the vane swivels with an EERIE SQUEAK.  Then a weird ANIMAL CRY is heard--a cross between a chicken CROWING and a wolf HOWLING. \nWERECHICKEN  (VO) (A CROWING HOWL) \nCAMERA PANS DOWN TO: \nCHICKEN PEN \nA fenced-in dirt area with numerous CHICKENS milling around, CLUCKING as they peck at the ground. \nWERECHICKEN (VO) (ANOTHER HOWL, nearer now) The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound. \nWERECHICKEN'S POV -- MOVING \nA RED-tinted, shaky, MOVING CAMERA TRUCK-IN on the chickens.  (These shots are in the style of the POV SHOTS in WOLFEN.)  Magnified GURGLING and HEAVY BREATHING of Werechicken is heard. \nWERECHICKEN (VO) (GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING) \nThe terrified chickens stare INTO CAMERA as the Werechicken moves closer, his shadow falling over them.  They flap into their coop, SQUAWKING wildly. \nINT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nMAUDE and ZEKE sit on the sagging couch watching a werewolf movie on TV while munching popcorn from a huge bowl.  They're distracted by CHICKENS SQUAWKING. \nWERECHICKEN (Frightening SHRIEK) \nINT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - CLOSE ON TV \nOld black-and-white movie.  MELODRAMATIC MUSIC as a man turns into a werewolf, his HOWL a continuation of the previous Werechicken SHRIEK. \nTV WEREWOLF (eerie HOWL) \nWIDER ANGLE - ZEKE \ncontinues watching TV and eating popcorn.  Maude walks stiffly into room behind him, eyes staring blankly. \nZEKE (without looking up) Everythin' okay out there, Maude? \nWAIST SHOT -- MAUDE \nShe stares with glassy, red eyes and CLUCKS quietly. \nMAUDE-CHICKEN (CLUCKS) \nZEKE (VO) What say? \nPAN DOWN below Maude's waist to reveal that she's turning into a chicken from the feet up.  First her shoes RIP apart as large, yellow chicken feet sprout.  Then her dress SWELLS and SPLITS, revealing a large, feathered body underneath. The only piece of clothing left on her is her apron.  One foot scratches the floor. \nMAUDE-CHICKEN (VO) (more CLUCKS) \nWIDER ANGLE -- FULLSHOT OF MAUDE-CHICKEN \nNow completely transformed and six feet tall, she leaps up to perch on back of couch, THRUSTING her chicken head repeatedly into the popcorn bowl in Zeke's lap, pecking the bowl clean.  Zeke's jaw hangs open, speechless, as he stares at the fanged, drooling, six-foot Werechicken.  The Werechicken looks up from the empty bowl, right in Zeke's terrified eyes. \nZEKE (SCREAMS) \nHe scrambles backwards off the couch. \nEGON (preoccupied; through above) Be with you in ... (checks watch) ...one minute, fifty-three seconds. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nPeter and Ray exchange pained glances.  Peter awkwardly attempts to pick up another trash bag while Ray stumbles around, his vision blocked.  PAN WITH THEM as they move toward door when Egon's weather balloon suddenly lowers INTO FRAME.  They bounce into and off of it, which sends the trash bags flying. \nPETER AND RAY (AD-LIB REACTIONS as they bounce off balloon) \nNEW ANGLE \nPeter stumbles backwards and lands butt-first right on one of the bags. Slimer SQUEALS from within it. \nSLIMER (VO) (big muffled SQUEAL) \nThen he comes shooting out the back of the bag, the lower half of his body flat as a Frisbee. \nSLIMER \nshakes himself off like a dog, spraying slime all over Peter. \nPETER (pissed; sarcastic) Thanks, Slimer.  I really needed that! \nSLIMER Sorreee! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRay helps Peter up as the telephone RINGS and RINGS. \nRAY (irritated) Egon!  The phone! \nON EGON \nThe RINGING phone is right beside him on the workbench. \nINT. -- ECTO 1 -- MOVING \nThe Ghostbusters, minus Egon, are wearing their gear.  Slimer hovers in back seat. \nRAY It sure feels strange not having Egon with us. \nPETER (sarcastic) Why?  Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us. \nON WINSTON \nDriving. \nWINSTON But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his?  He'll be a rich man! \nON PETER \nArms folded, grumpily. \nPETER Good.  Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores. \nEXT. -- ECTO 1 -- NIGHT \nAs it speeds OUT OF CAMERA toward distant farmhouse, PAN OVER TO the apron-wearing Maude-Chicken silhouetted in the moonlight, nesting in a haystack.  MOVE IN TO -- \nCLOSER ANGLE ON MAUDE-CHICKEN \nHer body starts to shake, she ruffles her wings. \nMAUDE-CHICKEN (Egg-laying CLUCKS) \nThen she suddenly sits up and leaps off the haystack, revealing an enormous egg beneath her.  Maude SQUAWKS and CLUCKS and struts off into a cornfield, pecking away at ears of corn. \nMAUDE-CHICKEN (SQUAWKS and CLUCKS) \nCLOSER ANGLE \nPeter and Winston stop, look at Ray in disbelief. \nWINSTON A werechicken? \nPETER Get serious, Ray. \nRAY Then explain those! \nRay points at ground.  Peter, Winston and Slimer look down. \nTHEIR POV \nPeter is standing with both feet in two enormous chicken footprints. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. -- OPEN FIELD -- NIGHT \nThe three Ghostbusters follow Maude's \"chicken\" tracks with powerful flashlights across a field spotted with haystacks.  Slimer moves ahead, nose to ground like a bloodhound. \nSLIMER (SNIFFS as he goes) \nANGLE ON SLIMER \nHe floats along above the flashlight-illuminated tracks which lead him right into the haystack.  We hear a BONK from within, then: \nSLIMER (VO) Ow! \nSlimer backs OUT INTO SHOT rubbing his head.  He looks up and his eyes pop wide. \nSLIMER (amazed GASP!) \nWERECHICKEN'S POV \nRED-TINTED, moving slowly toward Ray and Winston from behind. \nWERECHICKEN (VO) (HEAVY BREATHING) \nCLOSE ON RAY AND WINSTON \nThey stop as PKE meter starts BEEPING.  Ray checks the reading. \nRAY (whisper) Something's close.  Very close. \nWERECHICKEN'S POV \nClosing on Ray and Winston. \nWERECHICKEN (VO) (HEAVY BREATHING) \nThe guys wheel around. \nTHEIR POV ON WERECHICKEN \nWe see only its face.  The blood-red eyes stare menacingly, its fanged beak slightly open and drooling. \nWERECHICKEN (HEAVY RASPY BREATHING) \nZOOM BACK TO -- \nWIDER ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN \nIt hops forward into a streak of moonlight.  It's three feet tall, its wings hang out at the sides, and its evil, blood-red eyes stare at CAMERA. \nWERECHICKEN  (CONT) (HEAVY PANTING) \nSPIRIT (big ROAR) \nCLOSER ANGLE \nRay, still firing his gun, snaps a trap loose from his belt, and tosses it onto the barn floor.  It POPS open. \nRAY Trap out! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRay and Winston, struggling with the writhing Spirit caught in the streams, guide the Spirit into the trap. \nWINSTON Hang on!  That's it! \nRAY We've almost got him! \nCLOSE ON TRAP \nThe Spirit is sucked into the trap, which SLAMS shut. \nWIDER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON \nA normal chicken with singed feathers stands where the Werechicken was. It CLUCKS, starts pecking at the dirt. \nCHICKEN (Normal CLUCKING) \nRAY (looking at chicken) Well, that takes care of one werechicken. \nCLOSER ON THE GUYS \nRay picks up the smoking trap. \nRAY (CONT) Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's wife. \nINT. -- BEDROOM \nSlimer is SNORING, hovering above Peter's empty bed. \nSLIMER (SNORING) \nCLOSE ON SLIMER \nIn a BUBBLE above him, we see Slimer's DREAM, various kinds of food dancing and SINGING the first two bars of Los Lobos' \"LA BAMBA\" a la the California Raisins in \"I Heard It Through The Grapevine.\"  Still asleep, Slimer licks his lips hungrily, opens his mouth incredibly wide and pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth-jarring CHOMP! that POPS the dream bubble so that it EXPLODES inside his mouth, waking him up. Slimer sits up with a wide-eyed, hungry look, rubbing his tummy. \nSLIMER Fooooood. \nHe zips o.s. \nINT. -- KITCHEN \nDark.  Lights go on, then Slimer SKIDS to mid-air stop and whips open fridge.  His eyes pop as he sees the egg. \nSLIMER (licking his lips) Yummy! \nSlimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf, then the full weight of the egg drives Slimer straight to the floor.  The egg bounces on his stomach twice before he gets a grip on it.  Straining his little green brains out, he floats the egg up into the air and o.s. \nSLIMER (SQUEALS, then GRUNTS) \nANGLE ON OVEN \nSlimer shoves egg in the open oven, closes door, turns on the heat, then moves O.S.  The oven interior glows red and the egg starts to quiver. \nON SLIMER \nSlimer HUMS as he busily sets table for one:  placemat, a plate, utensils, salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish, ... a flurry of activity that all focuses on his personal eating spot. \nSLIMER (HUMMING through above) \nON PETER \nHe steps back into doorway, blaster leveled at Egon-Chicken, and SNAPS on the power.  It HUMS to life. \nPETER (horrified) What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain! \nRAY (VO) Peter!  Wait! \nA hand grabs Peter by the arm fust as the thrower fires, sending the proton stream off at an angle into ceiling, barely missing the chicken. \nPETER (surprised as he looks around) Hey! \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LAB \nas Ray pulls Peter out into corridor, Winston kicks door shut in the Egon-Chicken's snarling face and quickly locks it.  Slimer hovers nearby looking worried. \nEGON-CHICKEN (VO) (SNARLS) \nCLOSE ANGLE \nThe door SHAKES and SHUDDERS as the unseen Egon-Chicken tries to break through. \nPETER (irritated; through above) What's wrong with you guys?  That thing ate Egon! \nRAY Peter, that is Egon!  The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken! \nThe door behind them is starting to splinter and bulge from the battering of the Egon-Chicken. \nPETER (looking at door) You're kidding! (a BEAT, then) Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance. \nSuddenly the battering stops. \nWINSTON (looking toward door) What happened?  He's so quiet all of a sudden. \nSeen from the waist up (he's not wearing clothes), looking around, confused.  He sees Ray. \nEGON Ray, what is going on? \nWIDER ANGLE \nEgon is holding his tattered coveralls in front of his waist, like a skirt. \nEGON (CONT) And why am I naked? \nSuddenly Slimer flies INTO SHOT and gives Egon a big, sloppy kiss. \nSLIMER (as he enters) Egon! (KISSING SOUNDS) \nON PETER AND WINSTON \nPETER Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news. \nEGON (as he sits) Bad news first. \nWINSTON You've been turned into a werechicken! \nON EGON \nHis glasses slip to the end of his nose as his eyes widen.  He pushes them back up. \nEGON A werechicken? \nON RAY \nHe hurriedly thumbs through the TOBIN SPIRIT GUIDE. \nRAY (flipping through book) Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens! (reads) \"The werechicken appears during the full moon.  Anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken.\" (he looks at Egon) That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and... \nON SLIMER \nHe rummages through shelves, then looks down at Ray. \nSLIMER (aghast) No chickenbane! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRay and winston exchange panicky looks. \nRAY Then we've gotta go with this!  C'mon! \nThey run OUT with the mixing bowl of liquid.  Slimer follows. \nINT. LAB -- CLOSE ON EGON'S LEGS \nThey're once again turning into chicken legs and chicken feet.  Toes popping out like popcorn. \nPETER (VO) (YELLS) Come on, Ray!! \nWIDER ANGLE \nAs Peter and Egon stare down at the chicken legs and chicken feet. \nPETER  (CONT) (YELLS o.s.) He's changing again! \nRay, Slimer and Winston rush INTO SHOT. \nRAY (breathless) Quick, Egon, drink this! \nWinston hands the bowl of potion to Egon, who gulps it down. \nEGON (swallowing, GULPING sounds) \nWINSTON What was that? \nRAY The werechicken that bit Egon.  It's still out there somewhere. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nPETER (to others) Let's stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else! (to Egon) Un, no offense, Egon. \nThe three normal Ghostbusters dash toward door. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. -- AERIAL VIEW -- MANHATTAN -- NIGHT \nECTO-2 glides over the city, running lights blinking. \nINT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING \nPeter at the controls.  Slimer sits beside him, looking down at the city through binoculars. \nPETER (into radio mike) All quiet on the chicken front.  How about down there? \nINT. -- ECTO-1 -- MOVING \nWinston driving.  Ray on the radio. \nRAY Not a peep. \nWINSTON (gives Ray a dirty look) No pun intended. \nEXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT \nSeveral people run out front door SCREAMING as ECTO-1 passes. \nON RAY \nPAN WITH him as he cautiously moves along, aisle by aisle.  At far end of aisles, Winston can be seen doing the same.  The market is thrashed, spilled groceries everywhere. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs they reach the last aisle.  No chicken.  Ray joins Winston. \nWINSTON How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall chicken? \nBUTCHER (VO) (frightened SCREAM) \nRAY We didn't!  Come on! \nThey hurry o.s. \nINT. MEAT DEPT. -- ON BUTCHER \nHe's hiding under his butcher block, trembling.  Ray and Winston run INTO SHOT.  The Butcher looks up, eyes wide. \nBUTCHER A giant chicken just came through here -- it was thirty feet tall! \nCLOSER ANGLE \nWINSTON Thirty feet tall? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Butcher is pointing out open door.  Beyond is a parking lot with a trail of crushed cars right down the middle. \nBUTCHER (CONT) Yeah!  Look what it did to those cars! \nRay and Winston race out the door. \nWinston floors it and he and Ray accelerate forward INTO CAMERA. \nINT. BUNKROOM -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - MORNING \nEgon is \"perched\" on the window sill, looking pensively out at the city, still a chicken from the neck down.  A BEAT, then: \nJANINE (VO) (big SCREAM) \nEGON (startled CLUCK) \nStartled, Egon flutters up off the sill, gravity takes over, and he lands on his feathered butt. \nWIDER ANGLE \nRevealing Janine standing frozen in the doorway, eyes wide with disbelief, hands to her cheeks. \nJANINE Egon!  What happened? \nEGON It's a long story, Janine.   Can you get my coat, please?  I'm due at the weather board in forty-five... (CLUCK) ...minutes. \nON JANINE \nShe stares at Egon, totally bewildered. \nJANINE But what ...? (thinks better of asking) Nevermind. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nJanine takes a long yellow raincoat off a door hook and helps him into it. He's completely covered except for his head and feet. \nJANINE Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like -- this? \nEGON Trust me.  I'm of sound mind at least. \nApproaching CAMERA fast, it SCREECHES to a halt.  Doors fly open.  Ray and Winston LEAP out, open fire, their proton streams angling upward. \nLOW ANGLE POV - WERECHICKEN \nMoving toward them down the concrete canyon, flattening street lamps and power poles.  Ecto-2 can be seen flying above and behind it.  The proton streams are up toward it. \nINT. ECTO-2 \nPETER Take over, Slimer! \nSLIMER Roger! \nSlimer grabs the control stick in both hands as Peter leans out to one side with his blaster and fires downward. \nANGLE ON WERECHICKEN \nCaught in the three crossing streams.  It FLAILS about, knocking over street lights and bashing in the sides of buildings, and lets out a deafening HOWL.  A MONSTROUS SPIRIT emerges from its body and fills the screen like a transparent film. \nWERECHICKEN (enraged HOWLS) \nON RAY AND WINSTON \nRay tosses out the trap. \nRAY Let's reel him in! \nWIDER ANGLE \nAs Ray, Winston and Peter's beams draw the Spirit toward the trap. \nSPIRIT (angry HOWLS) \nCLOSER ON TRAP \nEGON'S POV \nAs the Werechicken climbs into view, scaling the upper stories of the Empire State Building. \nWERECHICKEN (distant SQUAWKS) \nNEW ANGLE \nThe Weather Board members see the Werechicken and start to SCREAM. \nWEATHER BOARD MEMBERS (SCREAMING) \nON EGON \nHe JUMPS onto a rope ladder hanging from Ecto-2 and climbs inside.  Slimer flies in right behind him and Ecto-2 rises up OUT OF SHOT. \nINT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING \nEgon settles into passenger seat.  Slimer hovers behind them. \nPETER (loud over engine) Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons \nEGON (holds up wings) Yes, but you'll have to work the controls. \nPETER (nods) Piece of cake. \nEXT. -- ECTO-2 -- MORNING \nIt banks off toward the Empire State Building as the Werechicken reaches the top of the spire. \nON WERECHICKEN \nAs it gets \"comfortable\" on the spire, fluffing its feathers.  It begins to quiver (like Maude did earlier when she laid an egg). \nANGLE ON WERECHICKEN \nBlizzard-like snow pelts it.  The chicken begins to stiffen and turn white with frost. \nWERECHICKEN (angry SQUAWKS) \nANGLE ON STREETS \nSnow falls on Ray and Winston as they gaze skyward. \nRAY AND WINSTON They did it!  All-right!! \nThey high-five each other. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. FIREHOUSE -- NIGHT \nA heavy snow continues to fall as CAMERA MOVES IN \nMAUDE (VO) (calls) Anyone for dessert? \nINT, FIREHOUSE - DINING AREA \nMaude (back to normal) emerges from kitchen carrying a large, steaming bowl.  Seated around the table are Egon (back to normal) Peter, Winston, Ray and Zeke.  No Slimer.  There are half-empty soup bowls in front of everyone and the diners all look full to the point of weariness -- except Slimer. \nEGON (raising hand) You bet, Maude. \nON PETER \nAs he looks at bowl of soup Maude sets down. \nPETER Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup! \n", "test1_input": "PETER  (CONT) (shaking his head; as he goes) Werechickens. \nWERECHICKEN'S POV \nThrough its RED EYES we see, from a distance, Peter and Slimer carrying the egg, Ray and Winston moving off in other direction. \nWERECHICKEN  (VO) (BREATHING & SLOBBERING) \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - LAB - NIGHT \nEgon still busy with his balloon as Peter and Slimer carry egg in through door. \nPETER (through above) Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you:  How about analyzing this? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nEgon looks around, reacts to egg. \nEGON Interesting.  That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen. \nPeter and Slimer set egg on Egon's desk. \nPETER I don't wanna hear about it, Egon.  We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets. \nPeter EXITS as Slimer ZIPS in close beside Egon, elbows on desk, chin in hands, eyeing Egon and egg expectantly.  Egon pushes glasses up off tip of nose and blinks at egg, not sure what to do with it.  CAMERA MOVES IN on egg and we -- \nMATCH-DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. -- FULL MOON IN COUNTRY SKY -- NIGHT \nCAMERA PANS DOWN from full moon to reveal the tiny figures of Ray and Winston approaching an old barn.  They stop, shining their flashlights on closed main door. \n", "test1_true": "RAY (holds up one hand) Shh! \nCLOSER ANGLE \nRay extends his PKE meter toward barn.  It BEEPS incessantly. \nRAY (low voice) It's in there. \nWINSTON (unclipping his blaster) Then let's get it! \nINT. BARN -- HIGH ANGLE ON MAIN DOOR -- WERECHICKEN'S POV \nThrough its RED EYES we see the barn door slowly CREAK open, revealing Ray and Winston peering in. \nCLOSER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON \nThey ENTER cautiously, Ray holding his BEEPING meter out before him.  The barn is dark except for the moonlight slanting through the loft window and the beams of their flashlights.  As the WIND picks up, WOOD CREAKS, HAY RUSTLES, and a piece of JUNKY machinery turns with a SQUEAL. \nWINSTON (WHISPER) Man, this place is creepy. \nRAY (WHISPER) It's in here -- I can feel it. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSuddenly the door SLAMS shut behind them and the FLAP OF BEATING WINGS SCURRIES through the darkness.  Winston JUMPS. \nWINSTON Look out! \nRay shines his flashlight toward the lofts.  Its beam catches a couple of startled pigeons as they fly out the window, pinion feathers WHISTLING. \nREACTION SHOT -- RAY AND WINSTON \nRAY & WINSTON (relieved SIGHS) \n", "test2_input": "SLIMER (nods) Uh-huh!  Uh-huh! (imitates werechicken) (SNARLING & CACKLING) \nINT. -- LAB \nEgon works at his table.  A now familiar Werechicken shadow appears over his shoulder and grows up the wall. \nCLOSER ANGLE - REAR VIEW ON EGON \nWerechicken creeps OUT OF CAMERA, bites Egon on the rear and pulls back o.s., chicken claws CLATTERING off into distance. \nEGON (looking around) Ow! \nBABY WERECHICKEN  (VO) (CACKLING fading into distance) \nON EGON \nDazed, he looks down at his feet. \nCLOSE ON EGON'S SHOES \nChicken toes pop through the leather, one at a time. \nEGON (VO) (dazed) What? \nCLOSE SHOTS \nAs Egon's transformation continues:  His coveralls RIP apart at the legs, then midriff, then his arms turn into wings.  Finally, a beak sprouts from his face. \nEGON-CHICKEN (Weird CLUCK) \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. HALL OUTSIDE LAB -- NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "INT. LAB \nPeter and Slimer look in, not seeing Egon, who is now a six-foot-tall werechicken, but still wearing his glasses, standing behind door. \nPETER (CALLS) Egon? (to Slimer) Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here that looks like a monster. \nThe Egon-Chicken jumps out right in front of Peter and Slimer. \nEGON-CHICKEN (CHICKEN HOWL) \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSlimer freaks and rockets right through the nearest wall. \nSLIMER (SQUEALS as he goes) \nPETER Holy cow!! \nPeter raises his proton gun. \nCLOSE ON EGON-CHICKEN \nHe flaps his wings wildly, his red eyes bulging, and GROWLS, revealing impressive fangs. \nEGON-CHICKEN (LOUD GROWL) \nEND ACT ONE \nACT TWO INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS LAB -- NIGHT \nEgon the Werechicken moves toward Peter, fangs bared in attack mode. \nEGON-CHICKEN (SNARLING as he goes) \n", "test3_input": "ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN \nAs the Spirit POPS back into its body, JARRING it.

EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MORNING \nThe werechicken is halfway to the top.  PULL BACK to reveal Peter, Slimer, Winston and Ray standing in street looking up at him.

Chicken freezes at very low temperatures! \nCLOSER ANGLE \nWINSTON Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot chicken in August? \nA BEAT, then the three guys look at each other. \nRAY, WINSTON & PETER Egon's weather balloon! \nEXT. -- BUILDING ROOFTOP -- MORNING \nNot far from the Empire State Building.  Egon stands before a group of seated MEN and WOMEN --THE WEATHER BOARD -- in his rain coat.

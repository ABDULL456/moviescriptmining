He looks at his own shadow thrown onto the street. He plunges through the doors into the lobby as a gun thumps and crackling shot chews the sidewalk. 
INT. LOBBY - NIGHT 
Moss hurries across the lobby. A glance to one side: A booted foot sticks out from behind the front desk. Moss slows approaching the stairway. He risks a look around the stairway wall. Ascending balusters fade off into the blackness of the second- story hallway. Moss sags. He looks back across the lobby at the front door. 
He unhitches his shotgun. He remains still for a moment holding the shotgun, back against the protected side of the wall. He quickly swings out and with shotgun aimed up the stairs he crosses to the back lobby. He quietly pushes open the back door. 
EXT. SERVICE ALLEY - NIGHT 
OUTSIDE Moss emerges into a shallow service alley, dark and dirty. He is at a run when we hear soft tock and a garbage can in front of him snaps and wobbles. He turns looking up, backpedaling. Another tock accompanies a muzzleflash in a dark second-story window. Moss fires his shotgun: loud. Chips fly off the brickface and the window shatters. Moss rounds the alley corner. He stops and squats. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT 
Wide: dark, deserted downtown Eagle Pass, Moss a lone figure resting at a corner. Close on Moss panting. He takes stock, painfully feeling at his upper chest where the lock hit, then touching gingerly at his side, beneath the ribs, newly bloody. He sighs. 
He listens. No noise. He gets to his feet with the document case in one hand and shotgun in the other. He waits a beat, back against the wall. He swings out and fires the shotgun into the alley and then spins back and runs a short block and rounds the next corner and stops to rest. 
EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT 
He waits for his breath to slow. He brings up the shotgun and readies himself. He swings out to look back around the corner. The street is empty. 
He waits, at the ready for whatever might emerge from the alley mouth a short block away. Long beat. Stillness. A panicky thought brings his look and the shotgun swinging back around: the man could round the block the other way. Empty street. Two empty streets: Moss doesn't know which way to cover, which way to go. He stands looking each way, trying to devise a plan. No basis for a plan. Quiet hesitation. Now, a sound: engine noise. An old pickup rounds a corner two blocks up. It rattles toward him. Moss lowers the shotgun. He keeps it to the hidden side of his body. The pickup dutifully stops at a flashing red traffic light. It comes on through the intersection. Moss strides out into the street. He swings the shotgun up and gives the driver a raised palm to halt. 
INT. PICKUP/EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT 
The truck stops and Moss opens the passenger door and swings the case in and climbs in after. 
The driver, an older man, gapes at him, frightened. 
MOSS I'm not going to hurt you. I need you to -- The windshield stars. A quick second round pushes part of the windshield in. Rounds come in without pause, cracking sheet metal, blowing the cab's rear window into the truckbed, twisting the rear- view. A round seems to have caught the driver in the throat: a gurgling scream as he claws at his windpipe, blowing out blood. Moss, quicker to react, has already ducked below the dash. A snap of the driver's head and a new freshet of blood from a shot to the head. The screams turn to low gurgles. Moss, jammed almost in to the driver's lap, frantically gropes for the shift. He throws the pickup into drive and stamps at the accelerator, driving blind as bullets continue to pour in. He raises his head enough to see his side-view. It shows sluing, bouncing, empty street, rough guide for steering. A tremendous jounce up onto the curb then off it, the driver's body swaying in its restraint. The passenger side window shatters: we are passing the gunman. Now Moss sits up to steer looking out front. Behind him through the shot-out back window the dark street is suddenly punctured by muzzleflash. It comes, for the first time, with a report: the low chug of the muted shotgun. Rattle of shot against sheet metal. Moss floors the gas to roar into a turn. The street sweeping out of view behind him produces one more chugging muzzleflash. 
EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT 
The pickup bounces but Moss, sitting fully up, can now steer. 
He goes half the length of the block and then yanks the wheel hard, braking. The pickup smashes a parked car and jacks around to a halt. Moss emerges from the pickup with his shotgun and goes to the sidewalk and backtracks. He covers behind a parked car. He sits leaning back against the car, waiting. His point-of-view: his own reflection in the facing storefront, a lot of the driver's blood on him. He sinks lower. A long beat. Footsteps. They approach without hurry. 
A gritty boot turn at the corner. The footsteps come closer still. They pass and recede toward the pickup. We cut to Chigurh approaching the pickup, shotgun held at ease across his body. He slows. Moss: he hears the slowing steps. He tightens his grip on his shotgun and tenses. Chigurh: slowing further, he sees: Bloody boot prints outside the passenger door. Moss rises. Chigurh is turning. He dives as, behind him, Moss fires. Shot peppers two parked cars -- the one Moss rammed and the one behind. Chigurh dived between them: hit or not? Moss advances down the middle of the street. He angles his head: anything under the cars? He fires twice. Buckshot claws up the pavement and the car bodies and tires, and the cars sink hissing to their rims. 
Moss crosses to the far curb, still advancing. No one behind the cars. 
He looks up and down the street. Nothing to see. He goes to the pickup truck, driver's side. He opens the door and reaches over the driver's corpse for his lap belt. 
EXT. EAGLE PASS BORDER AREA - NIGHT 
Deserted. The pickup truck rattles into frame. Moss emerges. He hoists out the case. He leaves the shotgun. It is very quiet. 
He looks around. The Rio Grande bridge. Moss walks unsteadily toward it, pressing his free hand to his side. A thought stops him. He turns. His bloody boot prints point at him like comic book clues. His shoulders sag. 
EXT. RIO GRANDE BRIDGE - NIGHT 
Minutes later. Moss heads down the right-hand walkway in stockinged feet, boots tucked into his belt. He turns and looks back toward the U.S. side. Empty walkway. He proceeds on. Three youths are approaching from the Mexican side. Fart types, they are laughing and walking unsteadily. As they approach they gape at Moss, covered with blood. The lead boy, holding a beer, wears a light coat. 
MOSS I'll give you five hundred bucks for your shirt and your coat. 
The three boys stare at him. 
AT LENGTH: 
YOUTH Let's see the money. Moss unpeels bills from a moist wad. The top one is bloody. 
SECOND YOUTH ...Were you in a car accident?

BOB Right here? 
GUS LACEY The kitchen table. That is correct. That's where my body is. But my mind...that's, you know... He gestures to the horizon. 
BOB Wandering? 
GUS LACEY Wandering. Roaming. Yeah. 
BOB So what have you seen lately?

GUS LACEY Lately I've been watching the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, England - which it turns out is the ghost of a dinosaur. That's an exclusive for you. 
BOB Okay. Wow. E.C.U of Bob's notebook - on which he has written You are Crazy. 
BOB (CONT'D) So...when did this all start for you Gus? 
GUS LACEY It started when I was a kid. I used to lie on my bed and RV my cousin, Irene, undressing at night. Then, when I was in the army I joined Bill Django's unit. He trained me and the rest, as they say... 
BOB Right. I don't know who that is. Gus gives a dreamy smile. 
GUS LACEY I can't really talk about Bill. 
BOB So what did you do in the army? 
GUS LACEY We were Psychic Spies mainly. That was our initial tasking but...once they realized what they were sitting on, the forces at work... He stops, his face darkening. 
GUS LACEY (CONT'D) We were trained to kill animals. 
BOB 
(BEAT) You mean, what...with your...? 
GUS LACEY With our minds. That is correct. Just by staring at them.

BOB 
(BEAT) Huh. What kind of animals? 
GUS LACEY One of our unit stopped the heart of a goat. 
BOB Wow.(Beat) I don't know what to say. 
GUS LACEY The power they unlocked in us... (Beat, sorrowfully) Last week I killed my hamster. (Beat) You wanna see? 
18   BACK OFFICE - LATER                                       18 TV SCREEN - playing a home video of TWO HAMSTERS in a cage. Bob and Gus sit watching the TV. Gus' mother hovers in the background. 
GUS LACEY You ever seen a hamster do that before? 
BOB Well, I've never owned a hamster Gus, so I don't know what... 
GUS LACEY Look at the way it's glaring at its wheel. Usually that hamster loves its wheel. 
BOB Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so... 
GUS LACEY Good. Then they'll know how rare that is. 
BOB Yeah, I guess any hamster-owning readers will know what's aberrant behavior and, uh, what's...Oh, shit, he's down! ON TV one of the hamsters has fallen over. 
(CONTINUED) 
18   CONTINUED:                                                18 
GUS LACEY Yeah, he's down. At this point I'd been staring at him for about three hours. The other hamster falls over. 
BOB Oh my God! You've dropped both hamsters! 
GUS LACEY No, the other one's just fallen over. They watch in silence. Then the hamsters get up and start eating.

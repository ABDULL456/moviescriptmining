{"train": "\"Out Of Sight\", production draft, by Scott Frank \n\"Out of Sight\" \nScreenplay by \nScott Frank \nfrom the novel by \nElmore Leonard \nWhite Final:        08/05/97 Blue Revised:       09/17/97 Pink Revised:       11/11/97 Green Revised:      12/15/97 Goldenrod Revised:  12/16/97 Buff Revised:       03/17/98 Salmon Revised:     03/23/98 \nBLACK \nWe hear TRAFFIC, some STREET NOISES, then... \nFADE IN: A MIAMI STREET - DAY \nThe financial district.  Lots of people in suits.  A shaky, spasmodic ZOOM IN finds... \nJACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter.  He starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then... \nWHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET \nAs Foley goes inside, we then... \nCUT TO: A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS... \nLOOKING FOR MONEY? \nYOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. \nWe then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're now... \nINSIDE THE BANK \nas Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION while he studies the bank layout. \nFoley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business area at the front.  An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes hands with the man and they both sit down. \nFoley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA. \nTELLER/LORETTA How can I help you, sir? \nFOLEY Loretta, you see that guy talking to your manager, has his case open? \nFoley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually, yet expertly, begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank. \nLORETTA That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant managers.  Our manager is Mr. Schoen, but he's not in today. \nFOLEY But you see the guy with the attache case? \nLORETTA (looks again) Yes. \nFOLEY That's my partner.  He has a gun in there.  And if you don't do exactly what I tell you, or you give me any kind of a problem, I'll look over at my partner and he'll shoot your Mr. Guindon between the eyes. \nLoretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at Foley. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) Now take one of those big envelopes and put as many hundreds, fifties and twenties as you can pack into it. Nothing with bank straps or rubber bands.  I don't want any dye packs.  I don't want any bait money.  Start with the second drawer and then the one over there, under the computer.  Come on, Loretta, the key's right there next to you.  No bills off the bottom of the drawer. (as she works) First time being robbed? (she nods) You're doing great.  Just smile, Loretta, so you won't look like you're being held up. (she smiles awkwardly) That's the way, you're doing fine. \nWe hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the front door.  When he turns back, he sees that Loretta's having some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) Here, give me the twenties.  I'll put 'em in my pocket.  Okay, I haven't had to give my partner a sign; that's good. Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds till after I'm out the door, make sure you haven't set off the alarm.  If you have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon between the eyes.  Okay?  I think that'll do it.  Thank you, Loretta, and have a nice day. \nLORETTA You, too. \nFoley heads for the door.  He pauses by Mr. Guindon's desk, looks back at Loretta.  Foley smiles at her, then turns to the Man sitting with Mr. Guindon, indicates Loretta... \nFOLEY She's cute, isn't she? \nThe man looks across the bank at Loretta. \nMAN Uh, yeah, I guess so. \nFoley winks at Loretta and walks out. \nMAN (CONT'D) (to Mr. Guindon) Who was that? \nEXT. BANK - SAME \nAs Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in. \nINT. CAR - SAME \nAs Foley tries to start the car.  No go.  He tries again. \nFOLEY Come on... \nBut the car won't start.  Foley bangs on the wheel... \nFOLEY (CONT'D) Fuck! \nFoley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open window into Foley's ear... \nCOP I think you flooded it. \nFoley looks to the passenger window, where ANOTER COP, smiling, now has his gun pointing at him. \nSECOND COP Get out've the car, sir. \nFOLEY Wanna hear a funny story? \nSECOND COP Shut up and get out've the car. \nAnd as Foley obliges, we then... \nFADE TO WHITE. \nWe hear a MAN GRUNT.  Then see Foley in SLOW MOTION as he jumps through frame, now we see a basketball come up in his hand as we realize he's on his way to the rim when... \n...ANOTHER GUY rams into him in mid-air, knocks him down. \nADELE Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack? \nFOLEY You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on tonight, eight-thirty. \nADELE Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored? \nFOLEY I said not as a rule. \nADELE So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about? \nFOLEY Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world. \nADELE What's free about it?  I'm looking for work. \nFOLEY What happened to Mandrake the Magician? \nADELE Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound-- \nFOLEY (cuts her off) Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing... \nADELE And the one driving the other car? \nFOLEY What're you talking about? \nADELE Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something. \nFOLEY Glenn Michaels. \nADELE Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool. \nFOLEY He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first. \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nAs MARSHALL SISCO -- fifty -- slides a small wrapped box across a table... \nMARSHALL Happy birthday. \n...to where KAREN SISCO -- twenty-eight, black suit, long hair, a knockout -- sits.  She picks up the box and shakes it. \nKAREN You fit another Chanel suit in here? \nMARSHALL Something better.  Open it. \nKaren starts to carefully unwrap the present.  Marshall watches, takes a sip of his drink, looks around the bar, sees how everyone's looking at the two of them... \nKAREN (opens the box) Oh my God... \nShe pulls a gleaming automatic pistol from the box... \nKAREN (CONT'D) It's beautiful. \nMARSHALL It's a -- \nKAREN --Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it. \nShe leans across the table and kisses him. \nKAREN (CONT'D) Thanks, Dad. \nMARSHALL Happy birthday, kid. (then) You want another Coke? \nKAREN (checks her watch) Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten. \nMARSHALL Which one is that?  The ATF guy? \nKAREN He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over. \nMARSHALL He's still married though, huh? \nKAREN Technically.  They're separated. \nMARSHALL Oh, he's moved out? \nKAREN He's about to. \nMARSHALL Then they're not separated, are they? \nKAREN Can we change the subject? \nMARSHALL What're you doing at Glades? \nKAREN Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights. \nMARSHALL You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators. \nKAREN No thanks. \nMARSHALL You used to like it. \nKAREN Dad... \nMARSHALL You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em. \nKAREN I really gotta go. \nMARSHALL We don't get to talk much any more. \nKAREN How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you? \nMARSHALL I'd like that. \nShe gets up, kisses him again. \nKAREN Thanks for the gun, Dad. \nINT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY \nFoley comes in, lies down on the bunk.  He looks about the cell.  All he's got to show for himself.  It's now quiet on the cellblock.  Foley closes his eyes and we... \nCUT TO: EXT. PRISON AUDITORIUM \nA few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE \"SNOOPY\" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook. \nINT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY (NOW) \nHe lies there another moment when... \nA PAIROF LEGS swings down over the side from the top bunk. Foley's CELLMATE jumps down, walks the three feet or so to the toilet, casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the bathroom.  Foley shakes his head and turns away... \nEXT. STRIP MALL - DAY \nAs Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling a slim-jim from the back of his pants, about to jimmy the door, when he sees... \nA WOMAN -- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries. \nBuddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman is opening her trunk before coming forward... \nBUDDY Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am. \nShe doesn't seem too sure about it, but lets him load the groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock. \nWOMAN I didn't ask for your help, so don't expect a tip. \nBuddy smiles, waves her off. \nBUDDY That's okay, ma'am.  I'll just take your car. \nShe stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off. \nINT. CHAPEL - DUSK \nIn the midst of a remodel.  As door opens and Pup comes in. Foley puts a finger to his lips... \nFOLEY They're right underneath you, Pup. They dug a tunnel. \nFoley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the chapel, eyes on the floor, listening... \nPUP I don't hear 'em.  Where's the tunnel come out? \nPup turns his back, walks up the aisle and across the front of the pews to a window. \nFOLEY Second fence post from the tower out there.  Go on, take a look. \nAs Pup stares out the window... \nPUP I don't see nothing there. \nFoley reaches down into a pew where's stashed a FOUR-FOOT CRUCIFIX.  He picks it up, starts up the aisle... \nFOLEY You will directly.  Keep watching. \nINT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - DUSK \nAs the high beams from her car show the prison parking area, then the fence strung with razor wire.  Karen parks near the fence, lights a cigarette and dials her car phone. \nKAREN Hi.  Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet. (beat) He's not?  Could you tell him that... never mind.  I'll call back. \nHeadlights hit Karen's rear-view mirror, a car pulling in behind her.  The lights go off, then come on again.  She adjusts the mirror to deflect the glare. \nINT. THE CAR BEHIND HER - DUSK \nAs Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field. He sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as Karen checks her face out in the rear-view. \nINT. CHAPEL - DUSK \nAs Foley moves up behind Pup, he lets his jacket fall to the floor, holds the crucifix down against his leg. \nPUP There some car headlights out there... (then) Jesus Christ... \nNow he pulls his radio from his belt, says into it... \nPUP (CONT'D) Man outside the fence!  By tower six! (responds to radio) This is Officer Pupko... (then) I'm looking at him, for Christ's sake! \nOkay-- now Foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it smack against the side of Pup's head.  Drops him clean with one swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a sound coming from him. \nINT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - NIGHT \nAs Karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees A FIGURE there, crouching down. \nKaren turns on her headlights.  No, not crouched.  The guy is coming out of the ground.  On this side of the fence. \nHead and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the ground.  Right in front of her. \nKaren leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights, poised there for a moment before taking off into the dark.  Karen gets out of the car... \nINT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME \nAs Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow the two cons as we then hear the sound of RIFLE REPORTS before the men disappear into the dark. \nThen Buddy sees Karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her trunk... \nBUDDY What's she doing? \nHe watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a holstered pistol. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) Uh-oh. \nBut then she throws the pistol in the trunk, ducks in there again and comes out this time racking a shotgun. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) Uh-oh. \nAnd now Buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and raise the shotgun as we hear A WHISTLE BLOW IN THE COMPOUND. Buddy gets out of the car... \nEXT. PARKING AREA - SAME \nAs Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty, standing by the hole they just crawled out of. \nKAREN Get your hands in the air! \nBuddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds, start edging away -- shit, they've come this far. \nThey look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark, then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate, to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it for the cons.  They take off running... \nNow Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't fire... \nThe hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it, open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are cut down as they run. \nKAREN How many was that? \nFOLEY Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola. \nKAREN That's funny. \nFOLEY I thought so, too. \nKAREN It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor. \nFOLEY I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went. \nKAREN I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison. \nFOLEY (beat) Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that? \nKAREN I don't have to.  I don't rob banks. \nHe looks at her, then looks away as we... \nEXT. CAR - SAME \nAs the car turns into a main highway now... \nINT. TRUNK - SAME \nAs Foley plays the light down the length of her... \nFOLEY You don't seem all that scared. \nKAREN Of course I am. \nFOLEY You don't act like it. \nKAREN What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much. (then) I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up. \nFOLEY Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife. \nKAREN You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time. \nFOLEY It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that. \nKAREN (thinking) Uh-huh. \nFOLEY We still talk, though. \nKAREN Sure. \nEXT. CAR - SAME \nAs Buddy passes a sign that says \"MIAMI, 74 MILES.\" \nINT. TRUNK - SAME \nAs she tries to get a look at him... \nKAREN You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do. \nFOLEY Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence. \nKAREN You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow. \nAnd for a few moments, all we hear is the sound of the car on the road.  Then... \nFOLEY Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him. \nKAREN I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on? \nFOLEY Is that right? \nKAREN They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich. \nFOLEY You're full of interesting facts, aren't you? \nKAREN It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nQuiet.  Empty.  A moment later the car flies past. \nINT. TRUNK - SAME \nFOLEY That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name. \nKAREN Faye Dunaway. \nFOLEY Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV... \nKAREN Network.  Yeah, she was good. \nFOLEY And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody... \nKAREN Peter Finch. \nFOLEY Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to. \nKAREN Bleeding on a country road. \nFOLEY It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you. \nWe HEAR FAINT SIRENS OS... \nINT. CAR - SAME TIME \nAs Buddy sees FLASHING LIGHTS approach from the opposite direction.  He stays cool as the green and whites get closer... closer... then fly right on past. \nINT. TRUNK - SAME \nAs the SIRENS SCREAM AT US FOR A MOMENT, then FADE. \nFOLEY You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen. \nKAREN Nothing. \nEXT. TOP OF OVERPASS - NIGHT \nAs Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen Audi that reads \"GONE TO GET GAS.\" \nFOLEY Have your clothes cleaned and send me the bill. \nGlenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade, move through the scrub.  Glenn leans against the car, flashers blinking. \nKAREN I'll send it to you at Glades. \nGLENN Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer? \nFOLEY Take your sunglasses off. \nGLENN I see better with them on. \nFOLEY You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head. \nGlenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) Wait in the car. \nGLENN You're in civilization now, man, ease up. \nFOLEY I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back. \nGLENN In the trunk? \nFOLEY The backseat. \nFoley stares at him, waiting.  Glenn motions to Karen... \nGLENN Come on.  I have to do what I'm told. \nShe walks past Foley without looking at him. \nFOLEY Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat. (looks at Buddy) Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes. \nBUDDY I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car. \nKAREN You can blame me if you want.  I don't mind. \nHe doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds it up, then throws it at Foley's feet. \nGLENN Here you are, sir. \nFoley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back on and takes Karen by the arm. \nBUDDY What's wrong with you? \nKaren looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the backseat. \nFOLEY Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know. \nBUDDY How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with? \nFOLEY His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out. \nBuddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform, all of them caked with muck. \nBUDDY You're pulling at it.  Here... \nHe lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and tearing the shirt. \nFOLEY I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out. \nBUDDY He ain't the problem, Jack. \nFoley looks at him. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) You wanna pull your head outta your ass and tell me why we're bringing her with us? \nINT. CAR - SAME \nAs Karen watches Glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door. He half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs his hand through his hair... \nGLENN ...if he thinks he can talk to me like this.  Shit, I don't even know what I need them for. \nKaren leans forward to have a look, sees Foley and Buddy against the dark foliage. \nGLENN (CONT'D) I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January-- \nKAREN Glenn? \nHis head turns so that we can see his designer shades. \nKAREN (CONT'D) You don't remember me, do you? \nGLENN (beat) It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there. \nKAREN No, that's not what I'm thinking. \nHe raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face. \nGLENN But you're sure we've met, huh? \nKAREN Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels. (then) I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled. \nHe doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's been turned to stone. \nKAREN (CONT'D) Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if we can work this out... \nHe turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead... \nKAREN (CONT'D) Do we have a gun in the car? \nGLENN I remember you now.  Shit. \nKAREN Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him. \nShe touches his shoulder and he jumps. \nKAREN (CONT'D) Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close. \nRipley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point. \nFOLEY You stick anything in this guy, Snoop, they transfer his ass outta here faster'n you can throw a fight, and you still end up with nothing. \nRipley nods, takes this in. \nMAURICE This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke? \nFOLEY I don't smoke. \nHIMEY (slowly rising) You heard the man.  Go on outta here. \nFoley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over. \nMAURICE Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system. \nFOLEY (looking at Himey) Thirty-two outta what, twenty? \nHimey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock Foley in the head when... \n...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand, like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor back-first with a loud thud. \nMaurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A WHISTLE.  They all freeze, look to... \nA PRISONER AT ANOTHER TABLE \nWho nods towards the door.  We PAN OVER just as A GUARD APPEARS, takes in the scene as a dazed Himey slowly pulls himself up, covers his now bleeding nose. \nGUARD What's going on here? \nMAURICE Oh, you know, reading's funnamental an' shit, we just excited. \nGUARD Clear outta here. \nThe guard exits.  Maurice and Foley are still staring at each other. \nRIPLEY Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing? \nMAURICE (looks at Foley) Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled. \nHe pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into Ripley's open hand.  Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a fist, crushing the fish.  He taps his fist to Ripley's. \nRIPLEY That's how you do it. \nMaurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with Himey.  Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at Foley. \nRIPLEY Thanks for your help. \nFOLEY Any time. \nWe hear a PHONE RING and then... \nCUT TO: MAURICE MILLER'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - (NOW) \nAs Maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television. \nMAURICE Stick and jab, fool.  Stick and jab. \nA frisbee whizzes past the television.  We hear A DOG YELP OS. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Hey!  Watch that shit! \nMaurice's girlfriend MOSELLE - about thirty, sleepy-eyed, in a green bathrobe - picks the frisbee up off the floor as THE PHONE RINGS AWAY on the bedside table right next to Maurice. \nMOSELLE (calls OS) Tuffy.  C'mere, boy... \nMAURICE You gonna answer the phone? \nMOSELLE What for?  It's not for me. \nMaurice watches as Moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a little wire-haired terrier, but it just bounces off the dog's head. \nMOSELLE (CONT'D) Bad dog. \nMAURICE (scoops up the dog) Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my little Tuffy? \nHe lovingly nuzzles the dog like it's his child. \nMOSELLE I'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra money. \nHe looks at her. \nMAURICE That's the dumbest thing I heard in my life.  Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't pay for shit.  You gonna get a gig, it's gotta be for one of the big three: Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit for the fat dogs.  Now answer the fuckin phone. \nShe comes over, picks up the phone. \nMOSELLE Hello? (hands it to Maurice) For you. \nMAURICE (takes it) This is me. \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH - GAS STATION - NIGHT \nAn antsy Glenn with his shades on talks on the phone. \nGLENN Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels. \nINTERCUTTING GLENN & MAURICE: \nMAURICE Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you. \nGlenn watches as some guy in a suit gets out of a black Lincoln Town Car and jogs to the john. \nGLENN Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash. \nMAURICE You crazy, come up here?  It's fuckin one degree outside. \nGLENN I wanna talk to you about a job. \nMAURICE Uh-huh. \nGLENN I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big. \nMAURICE Someone?  Gimme a hint. \nBURDON Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this? \nKAREN Coming to the Okeechobee exit... \nAnd now we see it... \nINSIDE THE CAR \nGoing over a hundred miles per hour, blowing past cars... \nKAREN Take the next exit. \nGLENN What am I supposed to do now? \nKAREN Glenn, take the exit. \nGLENN No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in. \nShe reaches over and grabs the wheel. \nGLENN (CONT'D) The fuck are you doing?! \nHe hits the brakes.  The car goes off the road, down the grade, the abutment coming right at us as we go back to... \nTHE HOSPITAL ROOM \nAs Burdon sets the file down, sits back now. \nKAREN The next thing I knew, the paramedics were taking me out the car. \nBurdon looks at Karen a moment, then... \nBURDON There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time. \nKAREN Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed. \nBURDON You talked to him? \nKAREN In the trunk, yeah? \nBURDON What'd you talk about? \nKAREN Oh... different things, prison, movies. \nBURDON This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies? \nKAREN It was an unusual experience. \nBURDON Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that? \nKAREN When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks. \nBURDON Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him. \nKAREN And what happened to Carl? \nBURDON The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then? \nKAREN Is that what you would've done? \nBURDON You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too. \nKAREN Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers. \nBURDON Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations. \nKAREN Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door? \nBURDON I have to qualify, is that it? \nKAREN You have to know what you're talking about. \nWe hear CHUCKLING OS.  Burdon glances at the doorway where we see Marshall now standing, enjoying this. \nBURDON We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more. \nKAREN You'll have to ask him. \nBURDON Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco. \nMARSHALL Agent Burdon. \nMarshall waits for him to walk out... \nMARSHALL (CONT'D) The white man's Burdon.  That's what everybody calls him in Miami.  The Metro-Dade guys.  He's got a knack for pissing people off. \nShe's not listening.  He sits down, takes her hand... \nMARSHALL (CONT'D) What are you thinking about? \nKAREN The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday. \nMARSHALL Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas. \nShe looks at him. \nKAREN I'll get it back when I get Foley. \nEXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nA dozen GERIATRIC RESIDENTS sit on chairs out front as Buddy climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm, newspaper under the other.  An old woman comes out the door as Buddy opens it and squints at him. \nOLD WOMAN Oh--  Are you delivering the oxygen? \nBUDDY Uh, no, ma'am.  Sorry. \nINT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBuddy's REAL apartment, not the one Karen pictured in her dream. This one's nicer, with a view of the beach.  Jack stands on the balcony going through KAREN'S PURSE. \nHe pulls out her wallet, checks out her driver's licence photo. He does the same with her gym I.D. card.  He finds her address book and opens it up.  A photo of her father slips out.  Jack examines it a moment, then flips through the book. \nHe stares at something in her bag a moment, then reaches in and comes up with her us Marshal I.D.  He slips it open and studies the badge and the picture opposite. \nFOLEY I'm a tourist. \nBUDDY You at least bring the gun? \nFOLEY (lifts straw bag) In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel. (points) That's her place. \nAs they drive past, Buddy indicates a MAN on the steps out front, obviously FBI... \nBUDDY There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere. \nFOLEY (watching something else) Uh-huh... \nBuddy follows Foley's gaze to... \nACROSS THE STREET \nAs a car door opens and Karen Sisco gets out, rifles her purse for change.  She drops a quarter, Foley now watching as she bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh... \nBUDDY Oh, my. \nFoley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under the car and grab it. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) Okay, you saw her.  That's all you get. \nThey watch as she walks to the Normandie and shows the YOUNG AGENT her ID... \nFOLEY I guess Adele's in good hands. \nBUDDY Sure looks that way. \nFOLEY (finally) Let's go to Detroit. \nBUDDY Now you're talkin'. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nAdele has the chain on the door, talks to Karen through the narrow opening. \nADELE You were both in the trunk?  Together? \nKAREN From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn. \nKaren watches Adele's face in the opening, freshly made up, heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss. \nKAREN The FBI didn't tell you I was with them? \nADELE They didn't tell me anything, they asked questions. \nKAREN But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car? \nADELE I know a Glenn. \nShe thinks a moment.  The door closes and opens again, all the way.  Adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties, but no bra. \nADELE (CONT'D) I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke? \nKAREN No, thanks. \nShe comes in, checks out the place.  She turns a chair from the glasstop table and sits down as Adele comes out of the kitchenette with a Diet Coke and packet of cigarettes. \nADELE Those are cute shoes.  The kind of jobs I get, I have to wear these killer spikes, they ruin your feet. \nShe walks away, comes back with an ashtray. \nADELE (CONT'D) When you were in the trunk with Jack... \nKaren waits, watches her light her cigarette. \nADELE (CONT'D) He didn't hurt you or anything, did he? \nKAREN You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative. \nADELE He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes. \nAdele sits down at the other end of the table. \nKAREN You didn't visit him in prison. \nADELE He didn't want me to. \nKAREN Why not? \nADELE I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer. \nKAREN But you spoke to him on the phone. \nADELE He'd call every once in a while. \nKAREN He called the day he escaped. \nADELE He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk? \nKAREN (beat, lies) He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life. \nADELE Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done. \nKAREN Did you know that when you married him? \nADELE He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, \"Okay.\"  Jack's so easy going. (then) He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband. \nAdele looks out the window.  Karen waits, looks to an end table where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere ten years back. \nADELE (CONT'D) I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean. \nKAREN Really. (looking at the picture) Hm. \nShe realizes Adele is looking at her. \nKAREN (CONT'D) Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself. \nADELE Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been. (chuckles) He tell you how they met? \nKaren shakes her head. \nKAREN (CONT'D) You can live or die, it's up to you. \nCHINO Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you? (smiles) I don't think so. \nKAREN You don't, huh? \nAnd with that, she kicks him in the knee.  Chino buckles over and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun... \nADELE (CONT'D) On your knees. \nHe does as he's told.  Karen raises his jacket, feels around his waist from behind. \nADELE (CONT'D) Lie face down on the floor. \nCHINO (hurting) What?! \nShe kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there.  She puts her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials.  She sees Adele staring at her. \nCHINO (CONT'D) (to Adele) Excuse me... \nKaren looks at Adele a moment, then says into the phone... \nKAREN Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco. \nCHINO Excuse me, Adele? \nADELE Yes. \nCHINO You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside? \nADELE (beat) Yes. \nCHINO Tell me, how do you do that? \nAdele looks at Karen, who shoves Chino's head to the floor with her foot. \nKAREN Shut up. \nBURDON (PHONE) Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you. \nKAREN Daniel.  Listen -- \nBURDON (PHONE) Where are you?  I been trying to reach you. \nKAREN I'm at Adele Delisi's. \nBURDON (PHONE) What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end. \nKAREN (looking at Chino) Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me? \nBURDON (PHONE) There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away... \nKAREN All right, but... \nBURDON (PHONE) But don't you do anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there. \nKAREN Sure, Daniel. \nBURDON (PHONE) Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me? \nKAREN Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force? \nBURDON (PHONE) (impatient) What?  Is that what you're calling me about? \nKAREN Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley? \nBURDON (PHONE) Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force. \nKAREN That's all I wanted to know. \nBURDON (PHONE) Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel. \nKaren hangs up, looks at Adele.  Adele nods. \nADELE You're good. \nKAREN Thank you. \nINT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAs Foley and Buddy quickly pack up their stuff. \nFOLEY First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of. \nBUDDY I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go? \nFOLEY Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking. \nBUDDY Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc? \nFOLEY Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now. \nBUDDY He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk. \nINT. SHALAMAR APARTMENTS - LOBBY - NIGHT \nThe ancient residents stop what they're doing as Burdon enters with eight guys in jackets and wool shirts hanging out, running shoes, half of them carrying what look like athletic bags. Karen meets them as they all walk to the elevator. \nBURDON You get the key? \nKAREN They're in 7D. \nShe hands it to him as they wait for the elevator. \nBURDON I want two men outside, front and back. Conway and Jessup go on up to seven, cover both ends of the hall. \nBurdon, Karen and the remaining four SWAT team agents.  Burden looks at them one at a time. \nBURDON (CONT'D) You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man. \nKAREN You're gonna use a ram? \nBURDON Yeah, why? \nBURDON (ON THE RADIO) Karen.  Report.  You see anything? Karen?  You there?  Karen...? \nINT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY \nAs Marshall walks Karen to the gate. \nMARSHALL He waved to you? \nKAREN I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did. \nMARSHALL You wave back? \nKAREN I didn't have time. \nMARSHALL I imagine you would've though. \nShe shakes her head. \nKAREN Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address. \nMARSHALL So? \nKAREN So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in. \nMARSHALL He doesn't seem to hold a grudge. (then) What I want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long? (looks at her) Any thoughts on that one? \nKAREN None I'd like to share. \nShe gives him a kiss... \nKAREN (CONT'D) I'll call soon as I get in. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - DETROIT - DAY \nSnow.  Everywhere.  A black Lincoln Town Car creeps through the neighbourhood full of big, beautiful snow-covered homes. \nMAURICE (VO) I don't just manage fighters, or deal product any more... \nINT. CAR - SAME \nGlenn -- sunglasses -- sits in the back with Maurice, aka \"Snoopy\" -- wearing a purple bandanna and his own dark sunglasses. \nMAURICE I've diversified since the last time you saw me.  I've vertically integrated and now I'm into home invasions and the occasional grand larceny. \nGlenn just nods, stares out the window. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) White Boy Bob's my all-around man, my bodyguard when I feel I need one, and my driver. \nMaurice indicates WHITE BOY BOB, a fucking huge, depraved- looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Watch the road, boy. (then) I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass. \nGLENN Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it. \nMAURICE It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there. \nThe car creeps past a huge Tudor-style country house. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself? \nGLENN If they're not busted now, they're gonna be. (then) It's wide open. \nEXT./INT. CAR - MAURICE NEIGHBORHOOD IN DETROIT - LATER \nPeople on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black Town Car moves past the broken-down homes, cars on blocks and snow-covered trash. \nGLENN So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it? \nMAURICE I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there. \nGLENN What? \nThe car pulls to the kerb and KENNETH -- a wiry black man in a bright yellow T-shirt and red baseball cap backward, always seems to be high on some chemical or another - gets in. \nMAURICE You get everything? \nKenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat.  Glenn stares at it.  Something about the bag makes him uneasy.  Maybe it's the HACKSAW that sticks partially out of the opening. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Cool.  Kenneth, this is the man I told you about, Glenn. \nKENNETH The one gonna help us rip off the rich guy? \nMAURICE That's right. \nGLENN Help you... \nWhite Boy Bob pulls out again.  Glenn looks at the two psychos in front, then turns to Maurice. \nGLENN (CONT'D) Wait a minute.  I'm letting you in on this, not all your friends. \nMAURICE You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts. \nGlenn can't believe this is happening. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Thing I'm worried about is you. \nGLENN Me? \nMAURICE Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk. \nGLENN Can I do what? \nMAURICE Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own. \nGLENN What-- when? \nMAURICE Right now, son. \nGLENN I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is my job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine. \nMAURICE Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want. \nKAREN I'll need a last known address. \nCRUZ That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone. \nKAREN Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed. \nHe turns and looks at her. \nCRUZ Yes, you are.  I'll call you tomorrow with the address. \nAs he gets into his car, we then: \nCUT TO: A NEWSPAPER \nThe crime scene from the night before.  A shot of Karen and Ray Cruz as they exit the house.  A headline reads \"TRIPLE MURDER\" blah-blah-blah... \nBUDDY (PHONE) You have the paper? \nREVEAL: FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nFoley, wearing a suit now, no shoes, no tie, looks at the newspaper photograph of Karen. \nFOLEY It's a terrific shot of her. \nINT. BUDDY'S ROOM - SAME \nBuddy looking at the same shot... \nBUDDY Outside of that. \nINTERCUTTING FOLEY & BUDDY \nFOLEY Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us. \nBUDDY She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather. \nFoley reaches in one of the bags from the Jewish Recycling Center and pulls out a tie. \nFOLEY I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you? \nBUDDY They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it. \nFOLEY You tell your sister about it? \nBUDDY Just hung up. \nFOLEY How long you talk to her? \nBUDDY Two hours. \nFOLEY How long were you with the girl? \nBUDDY Forty-five minutes. \nFOLEY You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again. \nBUDDY Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up. \nFOLEY Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it. \nFoley hangs up.  He faces the mirror, starts to tie his tie. \nRIPLEY (V.O.) I guess next time I see you, you'll be wearing a suit and tie... \nINT. RIPLEY'S CELL - DAY \nFoley leans in the doorway watching as Ripley, dressed in a jogging suit, and under the watchful eye of A GUARD, gathers up his belongings.  He's going home. \nFOLEY I still haven't made up my mind yet. \nRIPLEY What's to think about? \nFOLEY You goin' right back to work? \nRIPLEY First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons. \nHe tears a picture off the wall... \nRIPLEY (CONT'D) Here... (hands it to Foley) Something to remember me by. \nFoley stares at the photograph of sea life. \nRIPLEY (CONT'D) It's not the real thing, but it's still nice to look at. \nFoley looks at Ripley, who extends his hand. \nRIPLEY (CONT'D) See you on the outside, Jack. \nINT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nFoley finishes tying his tie, stares into the mirror, takes in the overall effect. \nFOLEY (smiles) Hi!  I just broke outta jail! \nHis smile fades, he then sits down heavily on the bed, looks at the picture of Karen another moment, then sets the paper aside, grabs the Yellow Pages, flips to HOTELS, and dials the phone... \nVOICE (PHONE) Atheneum Hotel. \nFOLEY Karen Sisco, please. \nVOICE (pause, then) I'm sorry, but there's no one by that name registered. \nFOLEY Thank you. \nHe dials the next number... \nVOICE Best Western... \nEXT. MAURICE \"SNOOPY\" MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY \nRed brick, showing its age.  Karen rings the doorbell and then waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy coat.  The door opens to reveal Moselle in her green silk robe holding her arms close against the cold. \nKAREN Moselle Miller? \nHer hand goes into her bag next to the chair. \nKENNETH Bring your own rubbers with you? \nHer hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip on a golf club.  Kenneth grins at her... \nKENNETHN (CONT'D) What else you have in there, mace? Have a whistle, different kinds of female-protection shit? \nKaren pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face. \nKAREN I have to go, Kenneth. \nShe gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's like a golf club grip. \nKAREN (CONT'D) Maybe we'll see each other again, okay? \nShe steps aside and brushes past him.  He grabs her left wrist... \nKENNETH We gonna tussle first. \nKaren flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots out of the grip.  She pulls an arm's length away from him and chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking away... \nKENNETH (CONT'D) God damn... \nHe lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear. \nKENNETH (CONT'D) What's wrong with you? \nKAREN You wanted to tussle, we tussled. \nAnd she walks out.  She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer. Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and comes out with a business card. \nKAREN (CONT'D) I wrote my hotel number on there -- in case you run into Glenn. \nMoselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe.  Karen smiles at her and walks out the door. \nEXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - DAY \nIt's snowing pretty hard when Foley and Buddy pull up out front. \nINT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME \nBuddy wipes the condensation off his window, so they can see the house. \nBUDDY Now that's a really big house. \nFOLEY Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison. \nBUDDY No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system. \nFOLEY Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way. \nBUDDY Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us? \nFOLEY Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- alone. \nBUDDY Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life. \nFOLEY Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and done it.  Do you? \nBUDDY (beat) What about that D.B. Cooper guy? \nFoley looks at him. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead. (then) Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide. \nFOLEY Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now? \nBUDDY My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack? \nFOLEY Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it. \nBUDDY You might not have a choice. \nFoley looks at him. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) They put a gun on you, you'll go back. \nFOLEY They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you? \nFoley turns back to the house.  And now we hear... \nMR. HEARN (VO) I think you're gonna fit right in... \nINT. RIPLEY ENTERPRISES PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY \nThe personnel guy, MR. HEARN, sits behind his desk, squeezing a grip exerciser and smiling warmly at Foley, who wears a shitty suit and tie. \nMR. HEARN Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long discussion about your role in the company and it was his feeling that you would be happiest working down here in Miami.  How's that sound to you? \nFOLEY Great. \nMr. Hearn pauses, looks down at Foley... \nMR. HEARN You're about a 42 long, right? \nFOLEY What? \nBut Mr. Hearn walks out without answering.  Foley looks at the desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half-eaten fruit-on-the- bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half-eaten Powerbar. \nFoley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with it. \nMR. HEARN Okay.  Let's see how she fits. \nFoley turns as Mr. Hearn bounces back into the room with what looks like a UNIFORM draped over one arm. \nFOLEY What is this? \nMR. HEARN Your uniform. \nFOLEY My what? \nMr. Hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads SECURITY on one arm.  Foley smiles... amused... angry... hurt... \nHe gives her a sympathetic expression. \nANDY Want to tell me what happened? \nKAREN Beat it, will you? \nShe stares at the guy until he turns away.  She sips her drink, stares once more out at the blizzard.  After a few moments, another dark suit appears, reflected in the window. \nVOICE Can I buy you a drink? \nBoom.  Not one of the executive guys.  She stares at the reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at JACK FOLEY now standing there in his new navy blue suit. \nKAREN (beat) Yeah, I'd love one. (then) Would you like to sit down? \nHe pulls the chair out, looking at her.  The three guys at the other table now staring as he sits down.  Foley offers his hand... \nFOLEY I'm Gary. \nShe hesitates, then shakes his hand... \nKAREN I'm Celeste. \nShe smiles with him.  When she lowers her hand to the table, his hand comes down to cover hers.  She watches his expression as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers, and lays her hand on his.  The tips of her fingers brush his knuckles, lightly back and forth. \nKAREN (CONT'D) It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress. \nFOLEY I can go to the bar. \nKAREN Don't leave me. \nFOLEY Those guys bother you? \nKAREN No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here. \nShe picks up her drink and places it in front of him. \nKAREN (CONT'D) Help yourself. \nShe watches him take a sip, smack his lips. \nFOLEY You like bourbon? \nKAREN Love it. \nFOLEY (passes the glass back) Well, we got that out of the way. (then) Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living? \nKAREN I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl. \nFOLEY Is that how you think of yourself? \nKAREN What, as a sales rep? \nFOLEY A girl. \nKAREN I don't have a problem with it. \nFOLEY I like your hair.  And that suit. \nKAREN I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it. \nFOLEY You did? \nKAREN It smelled. \nFOLEY Having it cleaned didn't help, huh? \nKAREN No. (then) What do you do for a living, Gary? \nFOLEY (beat) How far do we go with this? \nThis stops her, throws her off balance. \nKAREN Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay? \nFOLEY I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything? \nKAREN It's your game.  I've never played this before. \nFOLEY It's not a game.  Something you play. \nKAREN Well, does it make sense to you? \nFOLEY It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, \"What if I had stopped and said something?\"  It might happen only a few times in your life. \nKAREN Or once. \nThey look at each other a moment, then... \nFOLEY Why don't we get out of here. \nThey both get up.  The ad guys at the table watch as she follows Foley to the elevator.  Karen winks at them. \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nAs they ride down to Karen's room.  She looks at him, looks away.  The doors open and they exit. \nINT. HER HOTEL SUITE \nAs he follows her in.  She walks to the bar, fixes them each a drink.  He checks out the room, takes in her view. \nKAREN How'd you find me? \nHe comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her picture and shows it to her. \nKAREN (CONT'D) Oh, God... \nFOLEY I called your room from downstairs. \nKAREN If I had answered, what were you gonna say? \nFOLEY Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink. \nKAREN If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me? \nCUT TO: KAREN \nEyes open, serious now. \nREVEAL \nShe's lying in Jack's arms.  She looks at him a moment, then moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed. \nFOLEY You coming back? \nKAREN I'm just going to the bathroom. \nShe gets up and crosses the room to the bathroom and closes the door.  Foley picks up his Zippo off the night table. \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME \nShe comes in.  Looks at herself in the mirror.  Suddenly feels self-conscious.  She grabs a bathrobe off the door. \nINT. BEDROOM - SAME \nFoley lies there, fiddling with the Zippo, staring up at the ceiling.  She comes out again and stands looking down at him. \nKAREN I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking. \nFOLEY Why are you mad? \nKAREN Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade. \nFOLEY What about my motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will? \nKAREN I don't know. \nHe raises the covers, but she just stands there. \nFOLEY I know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a bottle he says is nitroglycerin.  He scores some cash off a teller, he's on his way out when he drops the bottle.  It shatters on the tile floor, he slips in the stuff, cracks his head and they've got him. The nitro was canola oil.  I know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing.  I doubt one in ten can tell a dye pack when he sees one.  Most bank robbers are fucking morons.  To go to bed with a bank robber for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd have to be as dumb as they are.  I know you're not dumb, so why would I think that?  Why would you think I might think that? \nShe comes over and sits down on the bed. \nKAREN You're not dumb. \nFOLEY I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain. \nThey lie there for a few moments, Karen watching him.  He senses this, looks at her... \nFOLEY (CONT'D) You getting serious on me now? \nKAREN I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen. \nFOLEY (beat) You know. \nAnd he kisses her. \nEXT. DETROIT - DAY \nThe sun is out.  The snow has stopped falling.  A white blanket covers everything. \nINT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME \nKaren opens her eyes, wakes up.  She closes them again, lies on her side, but doesn't move for a moment.  Then... \nKAREN Oh, for Christ sake, grow up. \nShe opens her eyes and rolls on to her back.  She turns her head: Foley's gone.  She gets out of bed. \nINT. SITTING ROOM - SAME \nKaren comes into the room tying her robe.  She looks at the coffee table where... \nSomething wrapped in a napkin lies by the half-empty bottle and the ice bucket.  She picks it up and slowly unfolds the \"gift\" from Foley:  Her Sig-Sauer .38. \nINT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nBuddy stands at the window looking out as Foley -- in his underwear -- sits at the table reading the newspaper, a room- service breakfast, a bottle of Jim Beam close by. \nBUDDY It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes? \nFOLEY I saw Karen Sisco. \nBuddy turns to him. \nBUDDY And she saw you? \nFOLEY Yes, she did. \nBUDDY So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal? \nFOLEY You know how I felt about her. \nBUDDY Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at. \nFOLEY It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different. \nBUDDY You find out? \nFOLEY Yeah, I did. \nBuddy watches Foley pour a shot of Jim Beam in his coffee. \nBUDDY So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks? \nFOLEY I don't know. \nINT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nKaren sits there staring at a Wild Turkey bottle, a couple of glasses.  She reaches for the phone, dials.  A moment later, we hear MARSHALL SISCO'S ANSWERING MACHINE and she hangs up. \nINT. STATE THEATER - NIGHT \nA ring set up on stage.  Men hang out on the side.  Where movie seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through the theatre to the bar.  Rap music booms out of speakers as fighters are announced. \nEveryone in here is black except for Glenn and White Boy Bob who sit at a table in the front row while Maurice in a dude black felt cap set on his head just right and shades walks along the apron of the stage. \nMAURICE Stick and jab, stick and jab! \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Kenneth, this is Mr. Jack Foley and this is Mr. Buddy, famous bank robbers. \nFoley nods to the raincoat draped over the back of a chair. \nFOLEY Who's sitting here? \nMAURICE Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back. \nFoley gives Buddy a look.  White Boy Bob grins at them. \nWHITE BOY BOB I think he must've fell in. \nMAURICE I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads. \nFOLEY Well, if he left his coat and he's been gone a while. \nWHITE BOY BOB The car's still there.  I looked. \nMAURICE (to the ring) Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off. \nFOLEY We're leaving. \nMAURICE The fuck you talking about? \nFOLEY Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is... \nMaurice takes Foley by the arm, moves him away from the table. \nMAURICE Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know? \nFOLEY I thought everything. \nFoley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while the other one takes wild swings and misses... \nMAURICE Glenn knows everything we suppose to do tomorrow.  Glenn could tell somebody that, yeah, but it don't mean shit. You understand?  'Cause Glenn don't know I changed the plan. (then) It's happening tonight. \nFoley looks at Maurice now. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it. \nFOLEY (beat) Give me a minute, talk to Buddy. \nMAURICE You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind. \nFOLEY I wasn't asking permission. \nFoley walks up to the bar with Buddy. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth. \nBUDDY Whatta you wanna do? \nFoley takes out his lighter, begins playing with it. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) You know they gonna set us up. \nFOLEY I get that feeling, yeah. \nBUDDY But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do? \nFoley looks at him a moment, then... \nFOLEY I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half. \nBUDDY Half for doing what? \nFOLEY Getting me out of Glades for starters. \nBUDDY And who watches your back? \nON MAURICE \nAs he sits down with White Boy Bob and Kenneth, watches as Buddy and Foley talk up at the bar. \nMAURICE Man has all that reward on his head and still talks like a con in the yard. You know what I'm saying?  Like he's a man you don't mess with.  Yeah, well, what I say to Jack Foley is buuullshit. \nEXT. MAURICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's snowing as Maurice, White Boy Bob, Kenneth, Buddy, and Foley pile into the back of a van, the name of some plumbing and heating company on the side. \nWe PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're watching from inside Karen's car.  She waits for the van to pull away, then follows. \nINT. VAN - NIGHT \nKenneth -- the fucking maniac -- at the wheel.  Buddy and Foley piled into the back of the van full of plastic pipe and equipment.  Maurice pulls on a pair of white coveralls. \nFOLEY That what they're wearing these days to break and enter? \nMAURICE Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it. \nFOLEY So you've done this before, huh? \nMAURICE Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it. (then) White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time. \nWHITE BOY BOB I left my wallet in the house I robbed. \nThe guy grins at them.  Foley can't believe it. \nMAURICE Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor. \nFOLEY That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight. \nMAURICE Hey.  You learn from doing. \nFoley and Buddy exchange looks.  Maurice turns around, a Beretta in his hand.  Foley looks at him.  Buddy tenses. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) You know how to use one a these? \nFOLEY I've seen 'em used on TV. \nMaurice hands Foley the Beretta.  Then reaches into a bag, comes up with a .38 he hands to Buddy. \nINT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME \nMAURICE First money, then pussy. \nAlone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head. \nFOLEY You ever wear one of these? \nBUDDY I don't ski. \nFOLEY Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around. \nINT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT \nKaren on the phone... snow falling all around her. \nRAYMOND CRUZ (PHONE) I'll send a unit over there, see if there's anything going on. \nKAREN Tell me where Ripley's house is.  I'll meet them there. \nCRUZ (PHONE) Karen, you gonna promise me you're not gonna go in, do anything stupid till I get there... \nINT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nFull of fat, cushy chairs and a sofa, everything white or black, a wet bar, a big TV, CD player.  Buddy moves into the doorway, peers inside. \nKenneth is trying to find a radio station while Maurice and White Boy Bob ransack the place.  White Boy Bob checks under the mattress... \nWHITE BOY BOB Hey-- \nMaurice and Kenneth look over expectantly. \nWHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D) I found a rubber. \nMAURICE White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress. \nMaurice looks out the door, sees Buddy in the doorway. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Where's Foley? \nBUDDY Checkin' the other rooms, like you said. \nMAURICE (to White Boy) Go keep an eye on him. \nWhite Boy Bob slips out of the room.  Maurice turns to Kenneth, who's still playing with the stereo. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Kenneth, fuck the radio, put on a CD. \nKENNETH (looking them over) I don't recognize none of these bands. \nMAURICE Just pick one, put it on. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME \nWhite Boy Bob watches from the end of the hall as Foley peers into each of the bedrooms.  Foley sees a back staircase and starts down.  A moment later White Boy Bob follows. \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME \nWhite Boy Bob comes down the stairs.  No sign of Foley.  White Boy starts down one hallway, then turns back.  Now he's lost. He opens a door, starts to walk into a closet, then backs out. He goes down the hall, turns into... \nTHE KITCHEN - SAME \nWhere White Boy Bob enters, calls out tentatively. \nWHITE BOY BOB Uh, Foley? \nHe takes in the huge room, the massive sub-zero refrigerator. He moves to the freezer, opens it, takes in the FROZEN STEAKS. \nWHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D) Cool. \nINT. HALLWAY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME \nAs Foley quietly moves to the doorway, peers into the kitchen, watches White Boy Bob starts going through the freezer, taking out steaks and stacking them up on the counter.  Foley shakes his head and moves on. \nINT. LIBRARY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME \nDark.  As Foley steps into the doorway, we BOOM DOWN to reveal a LIGHTED AQUARIUM in f.g.  He comes into the room, sits down in an armchair beside the fish tank. \nHe leans close to the glass, stares at the fish a moment.  He sees a door reflected there and turns to look across the room, sees how the phone cord disappears underneath. \nFOLEY They cut the lines, Richard. \nSilence.  The door opens and we see a terrified Richard Ripley sitting on top of a toilet, the phone in his lap. \nRIPLEY Foley?  That you? \nFOLEY How are you, Richard? \nRIPLEY Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs? \nFOLEY Maurice Miller, couple of his friends. \nRIPLEY Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God. \nRipley moves to the doorway. \nRIPLEY (CONT'D) Have they got Midge up there? \nFOLEY What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night? \nRIPLEY We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida. \nFOLEY A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were. \nRipley looks at him.  Foley pats the back of a chair. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) Why don't you come on over here, sit down, Richard, have a look at your fish. \nEXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - ROAD - SAME \nAs Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm. \nINT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME \nThe music ON LOUD (Herb Alpert -- Tijuana Taxi).  Buddy stands in the doorway, watches Maurice, out of his coveralls, as he takes suits and sport coats from the walk-in closet to look them over.  He tries on a coat, turns to the maid. \nBUDDY They look like plain old rocks. \nFOLEY They sure do. \nHe gets up, looks at Buddy. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) Go get a bag. \nFoley turns to Richard as Buddy comes back into the room with a plastic bag, starts reaching into the tank. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) I were you, I'd get up and run. \nRIPLEY I'm not leaving Midge. \nFOLEY Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you. \nRIPLEY If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving. (then) I love her, Jack. \nFoley looks at Buddy.  Now what? \nBUDDY C'mon. \nFoley just looks at Ripley, who doesn't move. \nFOLEY Good luck, Richard. \nMAURICE (OS) Someone down here? \nBuddy and Foley slip out the other door, down the hall, just as Maurice walks in, some of Ripley's clothes over his arm. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself. \nRIPLEY Are those my suits? \nMAURICE Where you been hiding, Dick? \nEXT. HOUSE - SAME \nA now-freezing Karen hugs a retaining wall, watches as Foley and Buddy emerge from the house. \nAT THE VAN \nAs Buddy leans under the dash.  Foley looks up at the house where we see shadows moving about in the upstairs window, hear the faint pumping of the music.  We hear the VAN START. \nBUDDY Okay. \nBuddy straightens up, looks at Foley. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) Come on. \nFOLEY Shit. \nBUDDY What? \nFOLEY They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they. \nBUDDY From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too. \nFOLEY And then they'll kill 'em. \nBUDDY At least. \nFoley looks at the diamonds in the bag. \nFOLEY We made it, didn't we? \nBUDDY All you gotta do is get in. \nAgain Foley looks at the diamonds, then... \nFOLEY I'm going back inside. \nBUDDY I'll go with you. \nFoley finally hands him the bag with the diamonds in it... \nFOLEY No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars. \nBUDDY Jack -- \nFOLEY Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone. \nBuddy just looks at him. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) I'm saying this isn't your problem. Far as I'm concerned, we're square. \nFoley turns to go. \nBUDDY Hey... \nBuddy hands him his gun.  Foley takes it, stuffs it in the back of his pants, and then turns back to the house. \nFOLEY Now get outta here. \nKAREN \nAs she watches Foley go back inside.  A moment later, the van pulls out of the driveway.  Karen makes a decision, starts for the side of the house... \nINT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE - THE FOYER - SAME \nFoley enters and we hear the maid scream.  Foley starts up the stairs. \nINT. RIPLEY'S STUDY \nMaurice and White Boy Bob both have their guns to Ripley's head. \nRIPLEY (hears the scream) Midge. \nMAURICE Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at. \nRIPLEY Foley's got it. \nMAURICE Where the fuck is Foley? \n", "test1_input": "KAREN Was it Foley? \nMarshall looks at her. \nRAY Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares. \nKAREN Oh... \nRAY We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away. \nMARSHALL Did you pay the guy the reward? \nRAY Yeah, as soon as we got back. \nKAREN Foley hadn't been there? \nHer father gives her a look. \nRAY This place was strictly Cuban.  If Foley had a ride he must have his own agenda. He seems to be the only one knows what he's doing. \nTHE PHONE RINGS.  Marshall moves to it. \nMARSHALL Hello? (beat) Yeah, she is.  Just a minute. (hands her the phone) For you. \nKAREN Hello? \nCUT TO: FOLEY ON THE PHONE - DAY \nOn the balcony.  Flipping through a copy of Vogue while Buddy watches television inside. \nFOLEY Hi. \nINTERCUTTING KAREN & FOLEY - DAY \nKaren just stands there, sees her father looking at her as Ray drones on. \nFOLEY You know who this is? \nKAREN Yes. \nShe walks out to her father's balcony now. \nFOLEY I just wanted to see if you're okay, make sure Glenn didn't hurt you or, you know, anything. \nMARSHALL Something I've been wondering, Ray... \nMarshall picks up the newspaper... \nMARSHALL (CONT'D) It says in the headline, \"I slept with a murderer, says shaken Miami woman.\" She lives in Little Havana, her husband's out of town working when one of the escapees shows up at her door... \nShe closes the glass door, so that they won't hear her. \nKAREN How'd you get this number? \nFOLEY Who was it answered the phone? \nKAREN None of your business. \nFOLEY I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you. \nKAREN That's my dad. \nFOLEY Really.  He has a cop's face. \nKAREN How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet. \nFOLEY And your gun. \nKAREN Think I could have them back? \nFOLEY How do we do that? \nKAREN Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off. \nFOLEY Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door. \nFoley stops flipping through the magazine, stares at what he's been looking for: an ad for Defiance perfume. \nKAREN There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out. \nFOLEY You won't do that. \nKAREN Why not? \nFOLEY Because you're having too much fun. \nShe doesn't know what to say to that.  Foley smells the ad. \nINSIDE THE HOUSE \nMARSHALL ...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle. \nRAY I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him. \nMARSHALL That's how you score now? \nON THE PATIO: \nKaren looks inside at her father talking with Ray Nicolet. \nKAREN My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him. \nFOLEY I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters. \nKAREN Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully? \nFOLEY Why?  You think he might tell you where I am? \nKAREN Unless you wanna tell me. \nFOLEY He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed. (then) That's not gonna be me. \nKAREN One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island. \n", "test1_true": "KAREN Whatta you mean we'll make it an island? \nFOLEY I just thought maybe you and me could-- \nBuddy opens the door, sticks his head out, startles Foley. \nBUDDY Who you talking to? \nKAREN Is that Buddy? \nFoley's caught off guard, hangs up the phone.  He looks at Buddy. \nFOLEY What?! \nBUDDY You better come see this. \nINT. MARSHALL'S CONDO - DAY \nAs Karen stands on the balcony another moment, then hangs up, opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room. \nRAY The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes. \nMARSHALL So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her. \nKAREN Dad. \nHe looks over at her now.  Gives her an innocent look. \nMARSHALL What? \nINT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nAs Foley and Buddy watch a news report on the earlier events at the hobo camp.  We catch a glimpse of RAY NICOLET, GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND, STICKING HIS CHEST OUT FOR THE CAMERA. \nFoley shakes his head as they show a shot of Lulu's body covered with a sheet. \nFOLEY Chino's gonna wanna talk to me. \nBUDDY He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you. \nFOLEY He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows. \nBUDDY He knows where she lives? \nFoley doesn't answer.  Buddy mutes the set.  Turns to Foley. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) Jack? \nFOLEY We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit. \nBUDDY So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans. \nFOLEY Her phone's probably tapped. \nBUDDY And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel. \nFOLEY Shit. \nEXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S BOAT - DAY \nKaren stands there with her car keys and purse as Marshall paints the trim on the boat. \nMARSHALL Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he? \nKAREN He's pretty laid back, confident. \nMARSHALL He remind you of that guy, Tillman? \nKAREN Not at all. \nMARSHALL But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again. \nKAREN I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles. \nMARSHALL Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it. \nKAREN My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it. \nMARSHALL You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack. \nKAREN Foley kidnapped me. \nMARSHALL Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping. \nShe gives him a look.  He goes back to his painting. \nMARSHALL (CONT'D) Go talk to the ex-wife. \nINT. ADELE DELISI'S APARTMENT - DAY \nAs Adele comes in, drops a stack of her cards on the glass-topped dining table and turns on the window air-conditioner when THE PHONE RINGS.  She grabs it... \nADELE Hi, this is Adele speaking. \nEXT. PAYPHONE - DAY \nAdele's neighbourhood.  Near the beach.  Chino on the phone.  He wears a painter's cap and a white jumpsuit... \nCHINO Oh, is this Adele? \nADELE (PHONE) Yes, it is. \nCHINO Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number. \nHe hangs up, glances about, then checks the little .22 stuck in one of his pockets.  As he then starts off down the street, we can see the name \"COLOR MY WORLD HOUSEPAINTING\" on the back of the jumpsuit. \nINT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY \nBuddy drives.  Foley -- in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit -- is beside him.  Buddy looks at him, shakes his head. \nBUDDY Nice disguise. \n", "test2_input": "INT. TOWN CAR - SAME \nKenneth and White Boy Bob nod along to some rap tape in the front seat.  Glenn sits in the back, looking pale, hugging himself, shaking.  Maurice looks out the window... \nMAURICE Was a time you see a gold Mercedes over in the parking lot has a license plate on it say HITMAN?  You know Tommy Hearns is inside.  Seeing the car would get our juices flowing. \nMaurice looks at Glenn now and grins. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) You already got your juices flowing, huh?  Pissed your pants back there at Eddie's house, didn't you? \nGlenn just looks at Maurice. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) That was some shit, huh? \nGLENN (indicates Kenneth) Why'd he have to do that to that girl? \nMAURICE Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl. \nKENNETH (smiles) Do what? \nGlenn says nothing, just looks at Kenneth. \nMAURICE Just wait till we get inside Ripley's house. \nAnd he and Whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car. \nGLENN It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car. \nMAURICE (beat) No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me. \nGLENN Why would I do that? \nMaurice looks at him, starts laughing.  White Boy Bob and Kenneth join in.  Maurice leans over... Glenn flinches as Maurice opens Glenn's jacket so that we can see the BLOOD splattered on his T- shirt. \nMAURICE Was worse than you imagined, wasn't it? (then, smiles) Baby, you with the bad boys now. \nINT. FOLEY AND BUDDY'S CAR - SAME \nAs they watch Glenn and Snoopy and White Boy Bob get out of the car. \nBUDDY Whatta you think? \nFOLEY I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner. \nBUDDY Or two. \nINT. BOXING GYM - DAY \nGlenn sits on a bench near the rear wall, facing the ring. Kenneth grabs a magazine, walks into the john.  A shirtless White Boy Bob lifts weights while Maurice moves around the ring calling to the boxers inside. \nMAURICE Stick and jab! \nVOICE Hey, Studs, how you doing? \nHe looks up, sees Buddy and Foley coming this way. \nGLENN Jesus Christ, what're you guys doing here? \nThey sit down on either side of him, close. \nFOLEY Weren't you expecting us? \nGLENN That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake? \nNow he turns to Buddy as Buddy stands up, takes off his overcoat and sits down again. \nGLENN (CONT'D) She knew me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  \"I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled.\" \nFOLEY Yeah?  She said that to you? \nGlenn turns to see Foley with a mild expression on his face, almost smiling. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em? \nGLENN (touches his head) I don't know... \nFoley notices the blood on Glenn's shirt. \nFOLEY Whose blood you got all over you? \nGLENN These guys, man, they're crazy. (looks off) Shit. \nFoley follows his gaze, sees Maurice coming this way, White Boy Bob beside him, carrying his shirts. \nFOLEY Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag? \nBUDDY What's he do now, tell fortunes? \nMaurice stands at the edge of the ring apron, looks from Foley to Buddy and back again, pretty serious about it. \nWHITE BOY BOB We have a problem here? \nMAURICE (walking over) Jack Foley, famous bank robber. \nFOLEY Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower. \nMAURICE It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh? \nFOLEY Low class of people there, Snoop. \nWHITE BOY BOB You call him that again I'll put your head through the wall. \nBUDDY What?  You mean Snoop? \nMAURICE Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy, is what White Boy's trying to say. He's a little crude, you understand. No, I left that Snoopy shit behind me. \nBUDDY But you call this bozo White Boy? \nGLENN White Boy Bob. (baiting) White Boy used to be a fighter. \nBUDDY What's he do now outside of shoot his mouth off? \nWhite Boy Bob stares down Buddy who couldn't give a shit. \n", "test2_true": "MAURICE Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold? \nFOLEY Glenn didn't tell you? \nGLENN I thought you guys were busted. \nFOLEY Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road? \nFoley looks at Glenn.  Glenn shrugs, laughs nervously.  Foley smiles, laughs with him, maybe a little too hard.  Now Maurice starts laughing.  Buddy, too.  White Boy's lost, looking from one guy to the next as Foley gets up, faces Maurice, his smile going away as he says... \nFOLEY (CONT'D) Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you. \nMAURICE Let's go outside and talk. \nFOLEY What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm. \nMAURICE Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater. \nFoley nods then looks at Glenn as Buddy gets up. \nFOLEY We'll see you tomorrow then. \nMaurice then watches as they walk out. \nMAURICE White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again? \nWHITE BOY BOB Ten gees. \nMAURICE Uh-huh. (then) You recall, did it say dead or alive? \nEXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT \nThe same decrepit two-storey place Maurice et al hit earlier. Now it's a CRIME SCENE.  A SMALL CROWD of neighbourhood gawkers stand just behind the yellow tape.  A HUGE SPOTLIGHT lights up the front yard. \nKaren pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly- freezing COP at the tape, working crowd control. \nKAREN I'm looking for Ray Cruz. \nCOP He's inside. (pissed) With everybody else. \nKaren ducks under the tape and starts up the walk.  She pauses to watch as two CORONER'S ASSISTANTS cover with a sheet a DEAD BLACK WOMAN who lies just below a broken upstairs window. \nINT. HOUSE - SAME \nHell.  Karen has to step over a body minus a face that lies in the doorway.  Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, A MAN ON HIS BACK, head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the chest.  He wears a dress, now bunched up around his waist. \nCongealed blood runs down the stairs.  COPS and CRIME SCENE TECHS are everywhere.  Karen looks at the guy on the stairs. \nVOICE Called themselves the Youngboys. \nKaren looks over as RAYMOND CRUZ, a stocky, genial-looking detective comes out of the kitchen. \nCRUZ Ironic, isn't it? \nKAREN How are you, Raymond? \nCRUZ Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer. \nHe kisses her on the cheek.  She indicates the body by the door. \nKAREN Quite a mess. \nCRUZ Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie. \nKAREN Who? \nCRUZ Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation. \nKAREN What is it with crack and transsexuals? \nCRUZ Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes. \nKAREN Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside. \nCRUZ Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window. (shakes his head) Fuckin' animals. \nThis shuts them both up.  Cruz indicates the door. \nCRUZ (CONT'D) Let's get some air. \nShe starts to follow him out, pauses as she sees something on the ground... \nA BROKEN PAIR OF SUNGLASSES \nWrap-around... a lot like the ones she remembers Glenn wearing. Karen stares at them a moment, then walks out. \nEXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT \nAs Cruz and Karen walk to his car, STROBES FLASH as press photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene. \nCRUZ Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI? \nKAREN I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee. \nCRUZ You know, I'm not in homicide any more. \nKAREN No, I didn't know that. \nCRUZ Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse. \nKAREN Detroit, you must be pretty busy. \nCRUZ Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too. \nKAREN Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that. \nCRUZ Who was the friend? \nKAREN Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter. \nCRUZ Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side. \n", "test3_input": "INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME \nAs Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs.  Maurice rolls down a few steps, right over White Boy Bob, as... \nFoley gets up, runs back to the bedroom. \nINT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME \nAs Foley enters, goes straight to Kenneth's body, begins searching for the shotgun (lifting the covers, turning over the body, etc) with no success... \nFOLEY Shit... \nINT. STAIRWELL - SAME \nAs Maurice attempts to prise the gun out from under the dead bulk of White Boy Bob. \nINT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME \nAs Foley, exasperated, stands back up... \nMIDGE (O.S.) This what you want? \nFoley looks to where Midge stands -- now back in her bathrobe, but more importantly, clutching the shotgun.  Foley crosses and takes it from her, begins to stride out of the room, when -- \nMIDGE (CONT'D) It's empty. \nFoley just looks at her. \nINT. STAIRWELL - SAME \nAs Maurice finally rolls White Boy Bob over, grabs the gun... \nINT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME \nAs Foley sticks his hand in Kenneth's coveralls, comes out with a shell, loads the gun, snaps it shut... \nINT. STAIRWELL - SAME \nAs Maurice cocks the pistol, takes a step up the stairs... \nKAREN (OS) Maurice-- \nMaurice spins around, points his gun down at Karen, now standing in the foyer, her own gun pointing up at him... \nEXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME \nAs Raymond Cruz and several green-and-whites arrive... \nINT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME \nAs Jack, about to exit, stops cold as he HEARS TWO GUNSHOTS, then a BODY FALL. \nHe stands still.  Not sure who was just shot.  After a long moment, we then hear: \nKAREN (OS) Jack? \nHe sees Midge looking at him, closes his eyes, sags against the wall. \nKAREN (OS) (CONT'D) I know you're up there. \nINT. FOYER - SAME \nAs Foley steps into the hallway, his ski mask now pulled down over his face.  He holds Kenneth's shotgun in one hand and his pistol in another. \nKAREN Come on, Jack -- don't. \nFOLEY Pretend I'm somebody else. \nKAREN You think I'd shoot you? \nFoley brings up the pistol and the shotgun.  AND NOW WE HEAR THE SIRENS... \nFOLEY If you don't, one of those guys will. \nKAREN What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down. \nFOLEY I told you, I'm not going back. \nHe raises the guns hip-high and we hear sounds behind Karen, but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or look around. \nKAREN Don't do this.  Please. \nThey stand there staring at each other. \nFOLEY No more time outs. \nHe raises the guns.  She sadly shakes her head. \nKAREN You win, Jack. \nShe fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns, grabbing hold of his right thigh.  And now Cruz and several other cops enter... Karen motions them to stop... \nCRUZ Karen, I told you not to-- \nKAREN Wait, I know him --okay? \nShe goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes. \nKAREN (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you. \nFOLEY You just did, for Christ sake. \nKAREN You know what I mean. \nShe glances about, makes sure no one can hear, then leans closer to him. \nKAREN (CONT'D) I wish things were different.  I'm sorry, Jack. \nFoley looks like he's in pain.  He watches as she walks back down the stairs.  As a couple of uniform cops rush past her and pick up Foley, a shaky Ripley staggers into the foyer. \nMIDGE Richard! \nShe comes running down the stairs into his arms.  They embrace. He looks at Foley over her shoulder... \n", "test3_true": "Foley just looks at him. \nEXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT \nAs Buddy pulls the van into an alley.  He jumps out, jogs back to the street and hails a cab... \nINT. CAB - SAME \nBuddy suddenly gets in, bangs on the bulletproof glass. \nBUDDY The airport. \nThe cab pulls away.  Buddy glances up front, then pulls the Ziploc bag from his coat and holds it up.  There's a bit of water in along with the diamonds.  A tiny fish swims in the water.  Something about this makes Buddy smile as we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. KAREN'S HOTEL - MORNING \nThe sun is out.  The sky is clear. \nKAREN (VO) They don't know yet if they want to bring him up on the homicides. \nINT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nKaren on the phone.  Her suitcase on the bed. \nKAREN I doubt if they will.  The Bureau's put a detainer on him, so when they're through with him here he'll go back to Florida. \nINT. MARSHALL SISCO'S SITTING ROOM - SAME \nMarshall on the phone... \nMARSHALL You gonna go get him? \nKAREN It's possible.  Why? \nMARSHALL I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can. \nKAREN He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks. \nMARSHALL My little girl, the tough babe. \nKaren hangs up, stares thoughtfully out the window. \nINT. PRISON CELL - DAY \nWhere Foley stands staring out of his window. \nVOICE Foley. \nAs Foley turns around and faces a FEDERAL MARSHAL in the doorway, we see that Foley's hands and feet are shackled. \nINT/EXT. PRISON STATION GARAGE - DAY \nThe Marshal leads Foley from the building to where a black government van waits.  The Marshal helps Foley inside. \nFEDERAL MARSHAL Have a nice trip. (looks OS) I'll get the other one. \nINT/EXT. VAN - SAME \nAs Foley sits down, stares at the floor.  He looks depressed. We hear the front door open, then close. \nKAREN (OS) Jack? \nHe looks to where Karen looks at him through a steel grate that separates the front from the back. \nKAREN I got you a present, something for the road. \nShe pushes A ZIPPO THROUGH the grate. \nKAREN (CONT'D) I have to take it away, though, soon as the ride's over. \nBefore Foley can say anything, the back door is opened once more and the Marshal helps ANOTHER PRISONER -- a black man with a shaved head -- into the back of the van. \nFEDERAL MARSHAL Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry. \nAn annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the door then gets in up front with Karen. \nFOLEY Hejira?  What kinda name is that? \nHEJIRA Islamic. \nFOLEY What's it mean, \"No Hair\"? \nHEJIRA The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622. \nFOLEY The flight? \nHEJIRA The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name. \nFOLEY You were at Leavenworth, huh? \nHEJIRA For a time. \nFOLEY Meaning? \nHEJIRA Meaning time came, I left. \nFOLEY You busted out? \nHEJIRA I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place. \nFOLEY (interested now) And how long was it before they caught up with you? \nHEJIRA That time? \nFOLEY There were others. \nHEJIRA Yeah.  That was the ninth. \nFOLEY (really interested) The ninth? \n"}

{"test1_input": "INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY (NOW) \nHe lies there another moment when... \nA PAIROF LEGS swings down over the side from the top bunk. Foley's CELLMATE jumps down, walks the three feet or so to the toilet, casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the bathroom.  Foley shakes his head and turns away... \nEXT. STRIP MALL - DAY \nAs Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling a slim-jim from the back of his pants, about to jimmy the door, when he sees... \nA WOMAN -- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries. \nBuddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman is opening her trunk before coming forward... \nBUDDY Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am. \nShe doesn't seem too sure about it, but lets him load the groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock. \nWOMAN I didn't ask for your help, so don't expect a tip. \nBuddy smiles, waves her off. \nBUDDY That's okay, ma'am.  I'll just take your car. \nShe stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off. \nINT. CHAPEL - DUSK \nIn the midst of a remodel.  As door opens and Pup comes in. Foley puts a finger to his lips... \nFOLEY They're right underneath you, Pup. They dug a tunnel. \nFoley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the chapel, eyes on the floor, listening... \nPUP I don't hear 'em.  Where's the tunnel come out? \nPup turns his back, walks up the aisle and across the front of the pews to a window. \nFOLEY Second fence post from the tower out there.  Go on, take a look. \nAs Pup stares out the window... \nPUP I don't see nothing there. \nFoley reaches down into a pew where's stashed a FOUR-FOOT CRUCIFIX.  He picks it up, starts up the aisle... \nFOLEY You will directly.  Keep watching. \nINT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - DUSK \nAs the high beams from her car show the prison parking area, then the fence strung with razor wire.  Karen parks near the fence, lights a cigarette and dials her car phone. \nKAREN Hi.  Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet. (beat) He's not?  Could you tell him that... never mind.  I'll call back. \nHeadlights hit Karen's rear-view mirror, a car pulling in behind her.  The lights go off, then come on again.  She adjusts the mirror to deflect the glare. \nINT. THE CAR BEHIND HER - DUSK \nAs Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field. He sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as Karen checks her face out in the rear-view. \nINT. CHAPEL - DUSK \nAs Foley moves up behind Pup, he lets his jacket fall to the floor, holds the crucifix down against his leg. \nPUP There some car headlights out there... (then) Jesus Christ... \nNow he pulls his radio from his belt, says into it... \nPUP (CONT'D) Man outside the fence!  By tower six! (responds to radio) This is Officer Pupko... (then) I'm looking at him, for Christ's sake! \nOkay-- now Foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it smack against the side of Pup's head.  Drops him clean with one swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a sound coming from him. \nINT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - NIGHT \nAs Karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees A FIGURE there, crouching down. \nKaren turns on her headlights.  No, not crouched.  The guy is coming out of the ground.  On this side of the fence. \nHead and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the ground.  Right in front of her. \nKaren leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights, poised there for a moment before taking off into the dark.  Karen gets out of the car... \nINT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME \nAs Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow the two cons as we then hear the sound of RIFLE REPORTS before the men disappear into the dark. \nThen Buddy sees Karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her trunk... \nBUDDY What's she doing? \nHe watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a holstered pistol. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) Uh-oh. \nBut then she throws the pistol in the trunk, ducks in there again and comes out this time racking a shotgun. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) Uh-oh. \nAnd now Buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and raise the shotgun as we hear A WHISTLE BLOW IN THE COMPOUND. Buddy gets out of the car... \nEXT. PARKING AREA - SAME \nAs Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty, standing by the hole they just crawled out of. \nKAREN Get your hands in the air! \nBuddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds, start edging away -- shit, they've come this far. \nThey look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark, then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate, to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it for the cons.  They take off running... \nNow Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't fire... \nThe hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it, open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are cut down as they run. \n", "test1_true": "A head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited, pointing towards the orange grove. \nThey run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to see if they're alive, then keep going. \nThe man in the hole, Foley, climbs out.  He takes his time, puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an honest-to-God hack, that serious cap down on his eyes. \nBuddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the shotgun on Buddy.  Buddy raises the palm of his hand. \nBUDDY It's okay, honey, we're good guys. \nKAREN What're you doing here? \nNot so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when they're already pretty sure what you're doing.  She glances around to include Foley, now coming at her like some creature out of the swamp, giving Buddy time to take her around the neck. \nShe fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip. \nThey drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence, past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange grove.  A moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence. \nFOLEY I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store. \nBUDDY Why don't we talk about it later? \nHe turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the headlights from Buddy's car; Karen not at all afraid. \nFOLEY Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun? \nKAREN I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys. \nFoley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious thought, but what he says is... \nFOLEY I bet I smell, don't I? (then) Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll get out of here. \nKaren looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk.  She's reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when... \nFoley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're cuddled up in bed. \nHe holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the gun in his face.  Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then everything goes... \nBLACK \nTotal darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing. Then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along. \nFOLEY (VO) You comfy? \nKAREN (VO) If I could have a little more room. \nFOLEY (VO) There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can? \nKAREN (VO) For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth. \nFOLEY (VO) You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders. \nA BEAM OF LIGHT appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it on.  He plays the beam along Karen's leg, calms down some as he looks at all of her now and finally says... \nFOLEY (VO) Where's your gun, your pistol? \nKAREN In my bag, in the car. \nThey go over some bumps.  We hear men's voices from somewhere far off, outside. \nKAREN (CONT'D) You know you don't have a chance of making it.  Guards are out here already, they'll stop the car. \nHe runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also, just, well, looking. \nFOLEY They're off in the cane by now chasing Cubans.  I timed it to slip between the cracks, you might say. \nEXT. CAR - NIGHT \nAs Buddy floors it away from the prison, checks the rearview mirror... \nINT. TRUNK - SAME \nAs Jack tries to wipe some of the mud off his face. \nFOLEY Boy, it stunk in there. \nKAREN I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me. \nFOLEY Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too. (then) Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall? \nKAREN The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me. \nFOLEY Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life. \nKAREN You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to. \nFOLEY If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford. \nKAREN Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this. \nMore bumps.  Then picking up speed as the road smooths out. \nFOLEY Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob. \nKAREN Buddy.  That's his given name? \nFOLEY (woops, beat) One I gave him, yeah. (mouths) Fuck... \nINT. CAR - SAME \nAs Buddy rifles through Karen's bag while he drives.  He looks up from her badge and ID case at the road. \nINT. TRUNK - SAME \nKAREN So, what's your name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway. \nFOLEY Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me. \nKAREN Why, are you famous? \nFOLEY Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer. \n", "test1_id": 594, "test2_input": "BURDON (ON THE RADIO) Karen.  Report.  You see anything? Karen?  You there?  Karen...? \nINT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY \nAs Marshall walks Karen to the gate. \nMARSHALL He waved to you? \nKAREN I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did. \nMARSHALL You wave back? \nKAREN I didn't have time. \nMARSHALL I imagine you would've though. \nShe shakes her head. \nKAREN Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address. \nMARSHALL So? \nKAREN So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in. \nMARSHALL He doesn't seem to hold a grudge. (then) What I want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long? (looks at her) Any thoughts on that one? \nKAREN None I'd like to share. \nShe gives him a kiss... \nKAREN (CONT'D) I'll call soon as I get in. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - DETROIT - DAY \nSnow.  Everywhere.  A black Lincoln Town Car creeps through the neighbourhood full of big, beautiful snow-covered homes. \nMAURICE (VO) I don't just manage fighters, or deal product any more... \nINT. CAR - SAME \nGlenn -- sunglasses -- sits in the back with Maurice, aka \"Snoopy\" -- wearing a purple bandanna and his own dark sunglasses. \nMAURICE I've diversified since the last time you saw me.  I've vertically integrated and now I'm into home invasions and the occasional grand larceny. \nGlenn just nods, stares out the window. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) White Boy Bob's my all-around man, my bodyguard when I feel I need one, and my driver. \nMaurice indicates WHITE BOY BOB, a fucking huge, depraved- looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Watch the road, boy. (then) I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass. \nGLENN Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it. \nMAURICE It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there. \nThe car creeps past a huge Tudor-style country house. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself? \nGLENN If they're not busted now, they're gonna be. (then) It's wide open. \nEXT./INT. CAR - MAURICE NEIGHBORHOOD IN DETROIT - LATER \nPeople on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black Town Car moves past the broken-down homes, cars on blocks and snow-covered trash. \nGLENN So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it? \nMAURICE I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there. \nGLENN What? \nThe car pulls to the kerb and KENNETH -- a wiry black man in a bright yellow T-shirt and red baseball cap backward, always seems to be high on some chemical or another - gets in. \nMAURICE You get everything? \nKenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat.  Glenn stares at it.  Something about the bag makes him uneasy.  Maybe it's the HACKSAW that sticks partially out of the opening. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Cool.  Kenneth, this is the man I told you about, Glenn. \nKENNETH The one gonna help us rip off the rich guy? \nMAURICE That's right. \nGLENN Help you... \nWhite Boy Bob pulls out again.  Glenn looks at the two psychos in front, then turns to Maurice. \nGLENN (CONT'D) Wait a minute.  I'm letting you in on this, not all your friends. \nMAURICE You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts. \nGlenn can't believe this is happening. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Thing I'm worried about is you. \nGLENN Me? \nMAURICE Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk. \nGLENN Can I do what? \nMAURICE Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own. \nGLENN What-- when? \nMAURICE Right now, son. \nGLENN I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is my job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine. \nMAURICE Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want. \n", "test2_true": "MAURICE Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without your ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do? \nGlenn looks at Maurice, now ice-cold behind the shades. \nWHITE BOY BOB We're here. \nGlenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit- looking two-story house.  Maurice opens the gym bag, passes the hack saw and a HAND AXE up to White Boy Bob, a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN to Kenneth, and takes out a big .45 for himself. \nMAURICE Let's go see Eddie. \nGlenn hesitates, then slowly gets out of the car as we hear... \nRIPLEY (V.O.) Must take balls, do what you do. \nEXT. LOMPOC FPC - YARD - DAY \nAs Foley walks with Ripley across the yard. \nRIPLEY Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up? \nFOLEY I don't know.  I never used a gun. \nRIPLEY Really? \nFOLEY You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way. \nRIPLEY (smiles) You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks. \nFOLEY No?  Where do you keep it, Dick? (Ripley smiles) I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about. \nRIPLEY (still smiling) I know what you're talking about. \nFOLEY You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute. \nRIPLEY Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do you believe Glenn? \nFOLEY Of course not. \nRIPLEY Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em. \nFOLEY Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You told him you keep 'em at your house. \nRIPLEY (shrugs, big smile) It's a big house. \nRipley sits down on one of the picnic tables, looks around the yard. \nRIPLEY (CONT'D) Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here? \nFOLEY Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why? \nRIPLEY I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever. \nFoley looks at Ripley. \nFOLEY It's a little late for me. \nRIPLEY Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really want to change, it's never too late. \nFOLEY I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type. \nRIPLEY Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As security, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick. \nFOLEY My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there. \nRIPLEY No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen. \nFOLEY The fish? \nRIPLEY Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept. \nFOLEY I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before. \nRIPLEY The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out. \nFOLEY And the guy sent you a bill for this? \nRIPLEY It works.  You should try it sometime. \nFOLEY The next time I walk into a bank. \nRipley shakes his head, then gets up... \nRIPLEY Think about my offer, Jack. \nFoley watches him go. \nBUDDY (V.O.) Hey, Jack... \nCUT TO: CLOSE UP OF FOLEY \nAs he turns to us. \nFOLEY What? \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE'RE INSIDE A CAR \nAcross the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red- brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood. \nBUDDY You see this one... \nBuddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) \"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying.\"  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years. \nFOLEY Love is funny. \nBuddy looks at him.  Notices something over Foley's shoulder. \nBUDDY Hey-- \nAnd now Foley turns and looks over as the black Town Car pulls into the Kronk parking lot. \n", "test2_id": 595, "test3_input": "He gives her a sympathetic expression. \nANDY Want to tell me what happened? \nKAREN Beat it, will you? \nShe stares at the guy until he turns away.  She sips her drink, stares once more out at the blizzard.  After a few moments, another dark suit appears, reflected in the window. \nVOICE Can I buy you a drink? \nBoom.  Not one of the executive guys.  She stares at the reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at JACK FOLEY now standing there in his new navy blue suit. \nKAREN (beat) Yeah, I'd love one. (then) Would you like to sit down? \nHe pulls the chair out, looking at her.  The three guys at the other table now staring as he sits down.  Foley offers his hand... \nFOLEY I'm Gary. \nShe hesitates, then shakes his hand... \nKAREN I'm Celeste. \nShe smiles with him.  When she lowers her hand to the table, his hand comes down to cover hers.  She watches his expression as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers, and lays her hand on his.  The tips of her fingers brush his knuckles, lightly back and forth. \nKAREN (CONT'D) It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress. \nFOLEY I can go to the bar. \nKAREN Don't leave me. \nFOLEY Those guys bother you? \nKAREN No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here. \nShe picks up her drink and places it in front of him. \nKAREN (CONT'D) Help yourself. \nShe watches him take a sip, smack his lips. \nFOLEY You like bourbon? \nKAREN Love it. \nFOLEY (passes the glass back) Well, we got that out of the way. (then) Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living? \nKAREN I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl. \nFOLEY Is that how you think of yourself? \nKAREN What, as a sales rep? \nFOLEY A girl. \nKAREN I don't have a problem with it. \nFOLEY I like your hair.  And that suit. \nKAREN I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it. \nFOLEY You did? \nKAREN It smelled. \nFOLEY Having it cleaned didn't help, huh? \nKAREN No. (then) What do you do for a living, Gary? \nFOLEY (beat) How far do we go with this? \nThis stops her, throws her off balance. \nKAREN Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay? \nFOLEY I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything? \nKAREN It's your game.  I've never played this before. \nFOLEY It's not a game.  Something you play. \nKAREN Well, does it make sense to you? \nFOLEY It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, \"What if I had stopped and said something?\"  It might happen only a few times in your life. \nKAREN Or once. \nThey look at each other a moment, then... \nFOLEY Why don't we get out of here. \nThey both get up.  The ad guys at the table watch as she follows Foley to the elevator.  Karen winks at them. \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nAs they ride down to Karen's room.  She looks at him, looks away.  The doors open and they exit. \nINT. HER HOTEL SUITE \nAs he follows her in.  She walks to the bar, fixes them each a drink.  He checks out the room, takes in her view. \nKAREN How'd you find me? \nHe comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her picture and shows it to her. \nKAREN (CONT'D) Oh, God... \nFOLEY I called your room from downstairs. \nKAREN If I had answered, what were you gonna say? \nFOLEY Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink. \nKAREN If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me? \n", "test3_true": "She looks at him, touches his face with her hand... \nKAREN You like taking risks. \nFOLEY So do you. \nHe kisses her now, puts his arms around her. \nKAREN What's the hurry, Jack?  You have to be somewhere? \nShe hands him his drink.  They both drink, then... \nKAREN (CONT'D) Sooner or later... \nShe stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass. \nKAREN (CONT'D) You really wear that suit. \nFOLEY That's not what you were about to say. \nShe shrugs, lets it go.  He puts down his drink, kisses her. She lets him, then moves to the couch. \nKAREN Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous. \nFOLEY She did, huh. \nKAREN You kept touching me, feeling my thigh. \nFOLEY Yeah, but in a nice way. \nHe sits down and they kiss again.  This time she peels his jacket off.  He does the same with hers.  He's starting to unbutton her blouse when-- \nFOLEY (CONT'D) (unbuttoning) I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy. \nKAREN He killed a police officer. \nHe stops.  Looks at her. \nFOLEY I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart. \nKAREN You believe that? \nFOLEY Why not? \nShe looks at him, decides to get off this subject.  Anyway he's finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands inside her shirt.  She closes her eyes. \nKAREN You know that Sig .380 you took was my favourite.  My father gave it to me. \nAs he kisses her on the neck. \nKAREN (CONT'D) What were you gonna do with me? \nFOLEY I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again. \nKAREN You waved to me in the elevator. \nShe's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt. \nFOLEY I wasn't sure you caught that. \nKAREN I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out... \nFOLEY Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while. \nThey look at each other a moment. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) You know I saw you on the street. \nKAREN Where? \nFOLEY Outside Adele's. \nHe starts to kiss her again, but-- \nKAREN You were going to see her? \nFOLEY To warn her about Chino. \nKAREN So she did help you? \nFOLEY I don't think we should get into that. \nKAREN No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet. \nFOLEY Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me. \nAnd he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand. \nKAREN Come on. \nHe gets up and she leads him across the room... \nINT. BEDROOM - SAME \nJack sits on the bed to take off his shoes, stands up to take off his pants. \nKAREN Are you gonna leave your tie on? \nHe looks at her, down to her bra and panties, watches as she gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him, standing close to help him with the tie... \nFOLEY My God, look at you. \nWhen her clothes are off, she loops the tie around his neck again and then as she turns off the light... \nShe kisses him.  He sits down on the bed, drawing her back with him, the only light now coming from the sitting room. \nFOLEY (CONT'D) You having fun? \nShe smiles and then they start to make love as we then... \nFADE OUT. \n", "test3_id": 596}

VIVIAN Am I supposed to imagine someone is going to put me in there? 
Mark is watching her over the top of the studio camera. 
MARK Yes, Viv... 
He peers into the viewfinder. In the finder we see Vivian looking rather pathetically into camera. 
VIVIAN Mark - I hope I won't let you down... I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me - but... I just don't feel frightened! Wouldn't it be better if I just did my number? 
MARK (shaking head) Later. 
VIVIAN Oh all right! I could do anything - I feel so relaxed - and that's due to you... You're so at home with that camera you make me feel at home too... you have it in you, boy! 
From her POV WE SEE see him raise his head slightly. 
MARK Ready, Viv? 
MARK VIVIAN (great effort) Well-I'll try - 
In the finder we see her wrinkling her brow. 
MARK VIVIAN But what... would... frighten me to death? (looking appealingly into camera) Set the mood for me, Mark... 
MARK Well... 
He goes and switches off the recorder. The sudden silence is startling. 
MARK Imagine someone... coming towards you... who's going to kill you - regardless of consequences... 
VIVIAN A madman? 
MARK Yes - but he knows it... and you don't... and just to kill you... isn't enough for him. 
VIVIAN But how would he frighten me to? 
She stares into focusing screen - intrigued, but not frightened, not even by the silence and shadowy vastness around her. 
MARK Stay there, Viv... you're... just right. 
She stands motionless - staring into camera. 
INT. CORRIDOR IN STUDIO - EARLY EVENING 
CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis. He is standing motionless, staring down a corridor. 
What he is staring at is out of camera - and it is puzzling the great man. 
He walks quietly along the corridor. 
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian. 
VIVIAN I can't imagine what you've thought of! 
INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He raises his head slowly - and locks the studio camera off. Then he walks slowly towards her. 
HIGH ANGLE SHOT of Mark walking towards Vivian. 
CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN to the trunk behind her. Mark's voice is overlaid: 
MARK (O.S.) Suppose this... were one of his weapons... 
CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis. 
INT. CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING 
The great man is poised for the kill. He is moving forward stealthily... and suddenly breaks into a run. 
CAMERA PANS - and WE SEE the object of his attentions. A wisp of smoke is coming from behind an alcove. 
CLOSE SHOT of a Fireman - smoking a cigarette. 
CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis - smoking! 
CLOSE SHOT of the Fireman's terror as he sees Don Jarvis. 
JARVIS Smoking on duty! 
The Fireman opens his mouth to explain Â— and smoke exudes. 
JARVIS Come with me! 
The Fireman follows him meekly. 
CAMERA PANS. 
So near - yet a lifetime away - a red light is burning above a closed door. 
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian - puzzled. 
VIVIAN That..? 
INT. STUDIO E. - EARLY EVENING 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. 
He is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsible tripod. 
Suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. WE SEE that a very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it. 
From Mark's POV WE SEE Vivian looking at the spike. 
He raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches from her throat. 
VIVIAN Yes... that would be frightening! 
MARK But... there's something else... 
We can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst - and gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it. 
VIVIAN Well? What is it? 
Just for a moment Mark's arm moves. His back hides what he is doing. Suddenly WE SEE Vivian turn her head sharply - she is looking at something out of camera. 
VIVIAN (in a whisper) That...? 
The spike is very close to her throat - but Vivian ignores it, staring out of camera. 
Over Mark's shoulder we concentrate on Vivian's face. 
VIVIAN (in a whisper) Mark... take it... 
The fear on her face is rapidly growing... 
VIVIAN ... away! 
She tries to move back - but the trunk prevents her.

Albert bursts into the square just in time to see Nicholls and Dad shake hands. Their business concluded. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS Thank you. 
Albert races towards Joey. Ted grabs him. Albert fights to get free. He looks at his father in anger and betrayal. 
ALBERT You can't! You can't, he's mine! I trained him! 
DAD Albert. 
Albert is hysterical. 
ALBERT You can't have him. He's my horse, sir. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS I'm afraid it's too late, lad. I've just paid thirty guineas for him. 
ALBERT (TO TED:) Please, I'll get you money. I will, I'll get you money. I'll...I'll work for it! I'll work for it. (TO NICHOLLS:) He won't obey anyone else. He won't be any good in the war, neither. He...he shies at every sound! 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS I'm sorry. 
Albert snaps to attention. 
ALBERT Well, if Joey's going, I'm going, too. I'm volunteering. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS I see. What's your name, lad? 
ALBERT Albert, sir. CAPTAIN NICHOLLS And how old are you, Albert? 
ALBERT Nineteen, sir. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLS Is that the truth? 
ALBERT No sir. But, but I look nineteen and I'm bigger than most nineteen-year- olds, sir! And I'm strong, sir! And I...I'm not afraid of anything. 
NICHOLLS INTERJECTS: 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS I don't doubt your qualifications, Albert, but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering, and your father's done what he had to do. You know that. Thirty guineas isn't nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your Joey, I know that. But it's all I've got. Will you lease him to me, Albert, to be my own mount? (he removes his cap, EARNEST) I promise you, man to man, that I'll look after him as closely as you've done, I'll respect him and all the care that you've taken with him. And if I can - I'll return him to your care. 
Albert looks at him. Although Nicholls speaks with authority he has a kindness which Albert recognizes. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D) Now say goodbye. 
Albert kisses Joey. 
ALBERT It's all right, boy... 
But at that moment, Sam Perkins pulls Joey away: 
SAM PERKINS All right, turn it in, eh? That's enough. He's a horse, not a dog. Now, on your way. (TO JOEY) Come on. 
Nicholls walks away into the crowd. The Sergeant pulls Joey, but Joey does not want to be separated from Albert. His reaction is implacable, reminiscent to the separation from his mother. Perkins leads Joey away. They disappear into the crowd and Rosie is suddenly there. Ted senses her silent judgment. 
DAD Do you want to lose the farm, Rose? 
ROSIE It's the way you did it. 
DAD But we're at war. 
ROSIE Aren't we just. 
She looks at Albert. Implacable. Forever. 
EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. THE SAME. 
The recruits march through town under pennants and the strains of a familiar song("The Jolly Plowboy") - it is a song they all know, which means a lot to them - full of soul - a song of harvest or a Celtic hymn, something relating specifically to the lives they have led together. Everyone of every age - everyone in the village knows this song - it is theirs. 
Nicholls passes in his car and we see those they are leaving behind - cheering - a whole generation of young men is marching off to war. One girlfriend rushes up to kiss her leaving boyfriend. 
Albert watches Joey, then remembers the campaign pennant dangling from his pocket. He runs up to Joey - 
ALBERT Joey... 
- and tucks the pennant into Joey's halter.

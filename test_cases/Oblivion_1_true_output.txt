INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Victoria stares at the screen, static hiss low and empty. It's not the first time he's done this, but she hates it every time. 
VICTORIA Jack...? Victoria works the panel, upping signal, boosting reception. The static is again MIXED WITH GARBLED SOUNDS. She listens, confused, ups the volume... BLIP! That signal from the Empire State starts again. This time it LOCKS ON, a loud and continuous electronic pattern. 
EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY 
JACK's ship emerges from a canyon into a beautiful landscape we have never seen before. This is Jack's SECRET PLACE. TREES exist on an island surrounded by clean water. And near the shore, a GROTTO, a carved-out portion of the hillside, supported with scavenged timbers, protected by plastic tarps. A ton of gear is piled inside. JACK has been scavenging for a long time. The BUBBLESHIP lands. JACK walks into the structure, slapping on a relay from a SOLAR GENERATOR. All around are young growing plants, including small yellow flowers and their GREEN SEEDLINGS -- the same Jack gave to Vika. Jack kneels down by an old military JAMMER. He checks a screen: the Crater Lake location is being jammed. 
INT_SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - DAY Victoria sits, the repetitive audio of the signal playing from her console. She stares at the empty map, the notable absence of the Bubbleship's icon on it. She keys the Comm, one last time. 
VICTORIA Jack? Jack, I really need you online... 
EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY 
A RECORD PLAYER is taped into his solar power system. An EARLY METAL POWER-BALLAD floats out of the speakers. Jack has a basketball hoop lashed to a pole. He shoots hoops by himself, the ROVER retrieves the ball. LATER. Jack brings a single CHAIR out in front of the water. He sits, and with care produces the books he's brought with him. He opens one with burnt edges: 
TREASURE ISLAND. .I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand- barrow... JACK is in an obscure state of frustration. He lifts another book, THE LAYS OF ANCIENT ROME: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: How can man die better Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his gods... Jack closes the books, strangely unsatisfied... 
INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - DAY 
ON VICTORIA, stuck with the audio signal playing. She moves the Tet Comm, hesitates. Then keys the control. 
VICTORIA Mission, this is Lieutenant Victoria Kohl, requesting a link. I may have a situation... A beat while the connection is made, then... 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Lt. Kohl, standby. 
(BEAT) What is your situation? 
VICTORIA I have a rogue signal of unknown origin. I'm sending you a relay. 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Have your Technician locate and report. 
VICTORIA (loathe to admit) Technician is... experiencing technical difficulties... She winces, that wasn't the greatest lie. Waits... 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Are you still an effective team? 
VICTORIA Yes, we're an effective team. 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Understood. Have your Technician locate and report. 
VICTORIA 
(SUDDENLY) We're happy, to be coming home. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: A long beat. Then: 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) (beat, then) It'll be good to have you back, Vika. Two more months. : ) Victoria SMILES despite herself. Nods, emotional. 
VICTORIA Will communicate findings on next Tet cycle. Understood. Victoria clocks off. Stares at the border area on the map where she last saw Jack. A KLAXON goes off in her workspace. Victoria STARTS. For the first time she seems confused as she works the console. She can't immediately figure it out... Suddenly she brings up a WIDE SCAN for tracking the Tet, The whole Eastern Coast of the continent. And something is closing, coming over the poles, FAST.

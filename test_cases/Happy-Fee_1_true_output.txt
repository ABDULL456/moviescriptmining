MUMBLE What is it? 
There, imbedded in the ice: another six pack holder. 
THE SEA ICE 
Mumble and the Adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond the whaling station, finding more and more of the strange artefacts: a piece of nylon rope, a soda can, a boot. 
MUMBLE They must be here somewhere. They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying around. 
AN ADELIE Maybe they invisible. 
FURTHER ON 
They've reached the edge of the sea-ice. LOVEDAY croaks a warning. He points out to sea. 
AN ADELIE What is that? 
A WAVE has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea. It is coming towards them, FAST like the bow wave of an IMMENSE UNDERWATER CREATURE. 
MUMBLE A whale? 
AN ADELIE As long as it's a good whale, not the other kind. 
The wave is coming CLOSER. 
ANOTHER ADELIE What other kind?!! 
A massive BLACK DORSAL FIN breaks the surface. 
MUMBLE The ones with teeth!! 
The PENGUINS are off and running... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
The DORSAL FIN keeps coming like the blade of a demonic carving knife. 
Then the monstrous fin disappears and KABOOM! The killer whale breaches the ice AHEAD of them, cutting off their retreat. 
They are left stranded on a free-floating ICE FLOE 
THE ADELIES ...Jump! ...Swim for it! 
MUMBLE No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safe 
The little floe is wobbling crazily 
THE ADELIES ...You call this safe amigo? ...Maybe we should split up. ...You split up I'm staying right here. 
The KILLER WHALE breaches again, rising like a tower block out of the ocean. 
THE ADELIES (CONT'D) Woooaaaahhh!! 
The ICE PAD flips, flinging them into the water like a handful of peanuts. 
IN THE SEA 
The PENGUINS head for shore , swimming for their lives. LOVEDAY, thrashing and wheezing, is unable to keep up. 
MUMBLE (stops) LOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!! 
He swims back. The KILLER WHALE is about to take them both in one bite. MUMBLE pulls LOVEDAY aside, but he's not quite quick enough: one of the Whale's outer teeth catches LOVEDAY by the SIX-PACK PLASTIC and he is DRAGGED AWAY, tethered to the KILLER WHALE like Captain Ahab. 
The WHALE thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the hapless little penguin until...

JACOB Take them off. 
Cal bends down, takes one off. 
JACOB (CHEWING) Other one too, please? 
Cal does as he's told. Jacob holds out his hands. Cal SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes. 
Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing. 
CAL What the hell!? 
JACOB Are you in a fraternity, Cal? 
CAL Those were my favorite shoes. (CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: 24 JACOB ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!? 
CAL No. 
JACOB Are you Steve Jobs? 
CAL What? 
JACOB ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF APPLE COMPUTERS? 
CAL No. I'm not Steve Jobs. 
JACOB Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go. 
25 INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 25 
Cal (barefoot) follows Jacob around the store. 
CAL I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea. 
Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES. 
JACOB Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items. 
CAL Ha! I think I read that in GQ. 
JACOB You did. I wrote it. 
CAL Really? 
Jacob CHUCKLES. Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what the chuckle symbolizes. 
JACOB Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers. (CONTINUED) 25 CONTINUED: 25 Cal is looking at a pair of ARGYLE SOCKS. 
CAL I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ? 
Jacob slaps Cal's hand, knocking the socks away. 
JACOB Your credit card please? 
MONTAGE - FROM STORE TO STORE 
We watch as Jacob narrates the wardrobe essentials (and as Cal's arms get progressively fuller) in each store. 
26 IN A SUIT STORE 26 
Cal gets fitted. 
JACOB (V.O.) Two suits: one black, one grey. One sports jacket, navy preferred. 
Jacob leans in toward the tailor. 
JACOB Take it in there... and there. 
27 AT ANOTHER STORE 27 
Cal holds jeans in front of him, eyes them suspiciously. JACOB (V.O.) One pair of quality jeans. 
CAL These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the Gap? 
He looks up. Jacob is gone. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
28 EXT. MALL - MOMENTS LATER 28 
Cal runs outside. Jacob is already halfway to the car. 
CAL I'm sorry! Don't leave! (CONTINUED) 28 CONTINUED: 28 Jacob immediately heads back inside and answers: 
JACOB No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap. 
CAL What's wrong with the Gap? 
JACOB In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal.

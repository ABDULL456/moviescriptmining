She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away. 
INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak quietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear. 
ELSA (whispers) I can't forget... how wonderful it was. 
HENRY Thank you. It was rather wonderful. 
She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather disappointed. 
VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment. 
VOGEL Doctor Schneider! Your car is waiting. 
ELSA (to INDY, after finishing the kiss) That's how Austrians say goodbye. 
ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
VOGEL And this is how we say goodbye in Germany, Doctor Jones. 
VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head around. 
HENRY Ohh. . . 
VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear. 
INDY (to himself) Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better. 
HENRY So did I. 
INDY Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do! 
HENRY (confused) You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear! 
INDY Are you kidding?I made that up! You know Marcushe got lost once in his own museum! 
Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency. 
INDY Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket? 
HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his body around towards Henry's hand. 
HENRY What am I looking for? INDY My lucky charm. 
HENRY Feels like a cigarette lighter. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
INDY Try and burn through the ropes. 
HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame. 
HENRY Very good. 
HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to burn. INDY doesn't know it yet. 
HENRY I ought to tell you something. 
INDY Don't get sentimental now Dad save it 'til we get out of here. 
HENRY The floor's on fire! See?! 
INDY (turns and sees) What??? 
HENRY And the chair. 
INDY All right, movel Move!  Rock your Chair.  Do what I do. 
They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet. 
EXT. CASTLE - DAY 
as ELSA is driven away. VOGEL and DONOVAN remain behind, flanked by NAZI SOLDIERS . 
Another car pulls up and VOGEL holds the door open for DONOVAN who gets into the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a written message for Donovan. 
LIEUTENANT Etwas wichtig, mein Herr. 
DONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message. 
DONOVAN Well, we have Marcus Brody. But more important, we have the map. 
A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for DONOVAN. 
CONTINUED: 
RADIO OPERATOR Aus Berlin, mein Herr. 
DONOVAN (reading) "By the personal command of the Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to success. Eliminate the American conspirators." (to VOGEL) Germany has declared war on the Jones boys. (to DRIVER) Los fahren. 
The car drives off. 
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY 
INDY and HENRY are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. Indy tries to communicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in opposite directions.

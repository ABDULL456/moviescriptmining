BRUTAL Oh, my suds and body! A history lesson! You just never know what you're gonna get when you come to work everyday on the Green Mile. Thank you, Wild Bill. 
Billy lets out a scream of rage and throws himself at Brutal. Brutal, bored, shoves him back toward Paul, who then propels him down the Mile toward the open restraint room door. Billy sees where they intend to put him, resorts to pleading: 
BILLY Oh, not in there! C'mon now, I'll be good! Honest Injun I will! No! No! Ummmmhhhh...urg...ah! 
He suddenly drops to the floor, bucking and jerking wildly, spewing drool. Harry's eyes go wide. 
HARRY Holy Christ, he's pitchin' a fit! 
Paul reaches down and unceremoniously starts dragging Billy kicking and writhing the rest of the way. 
PAUL He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on this one. 
Brutal helps Paul toss Billy headlong into the padded room. They slam the door... 
RESTRAINT ROOM 
...and Billy staggers to his feet in the straitjacket, inarticulate with rage, starts throwing himself against the door, screaming at the top of his lungs. 
BILLY ALL I WANTED ME WAS A LITTLE CORNBREAD, YOU MUTHERFUCKERS! 
FADE TO: 
INT. E BLOCK - NEXT DAY 
Paul and Brutal unlock the restraint room. Billy looks up from the corner, pale and drained. Softly: 
BILLY I learnt my lesson. I'll be good. 
CUT TO: 
INT. E BLOCK - DAY 
Billy's back in his cell, quiet for a change. Toot-Toot is outside the bars, mopping the floor. Billy notices a chocolate Moon Pie in Toot's shirt pocket. 
BILLY Pssss. Hey. Give'ya nickel for that Moon Pie. 
Toot looks around. Nobody's watching, and a nickel's a nickel. He steps to Billy's bars, swaps the Moon Pie for the money. 
Toot hurries away. Billy unwraps the Moon Pie, makes sure he's not being watched...and crams the entire thing into his mouth... 
DISSOLVE: 
...and here comes Brutal strolling down the Mile, doing a cell check and jotting on a clipboard. He pauses, seeing: 
Billy at his bars. Just standing there staring. His cheeks bulging way out. 
Brutal steps closer, fascinated...what the fuck is that. Billy waits until he's just a bit closer-- 
--and he slams his fists against his own cheeks, propelling a disgusting spew of liquefied chocolate sludge into Brutal's face. Billy falls back onto his bunk, shrieking with laughter: 
BILLY Li'l Black Sambo, yassuh, boss, yassuh, howdoo you do? 
BRUTAL (beat, calmly) Hope your bags are packed. 
TIMECUT: 
...and once again, Billy gets dragged to the restraint room, kicking and screaming all the way. They toss him in, slam the door. Brutal turns, still wiping traces of sludge off. 
PAUL The Moon Pie thing was pretty original. Gotta give him that. 
Brutal nods. They walk away as we 
FADE TO: 
INT. E BLOCK - DAY 
Paul and Brutal appear at Del's bars with Harry and Dean. 
PAUL Del, grab your things. Big day for you and Mr. Jingles. 
DEL Whatchoo talkin' bout? 
PAUL Important folks heard about your mouse, wanna see him perform. Not just guards, either. One of them's a politician all the way from the state capital, I believe. 
Del swells with pride upon hearing this. He scrounges up Mr. Jingles props, steps from his cell, looks to Harry and Dean. 
DEL You fellas comin'? 
HARRY We got other fish to fry just now, Del, but you knock 'em for a loop. 
Del nods, beaming happily, looks to Coffey in his cell. 
COFFEY You knock 'em for a loop like Mr. Harry says, Del. 
Brutal leads Del up the Mile, Paul and the others at their heels. Percy's at the duty desk. He smirks and rolls his eyes as Del goes by. The moment Brutal and Del are out the door... 
...Toot emerges from Paul's office where he's been hiding. 
PAUL Let's move along briskly, folks. There's not much time. 
Toot hurries down to take his place in Del's cell. 
TOOT I'm sittin' down, I'm sittin' down, I'm sittin' down. 
INT. OFFICE/ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY 
A HALF DOZEN GUARDS are waiting. We find Bill Dodge fixing the tie of a fat good ol' boy named EARL.

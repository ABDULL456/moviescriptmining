WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN 
The Sheriff and Wayne reload. 
HANK (O.S.) Anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on? 
The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see... 
HANK 
In his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting gear, rifle at the ready. 
SHERIFF Hey, Hank. That money I told you about? From the armored car? We're gonna keep it. Three million dollars. Four ways. (shoots at crypt) Seven fifty apiece. You okay with that? 
Hank is stunned. He doesn't answer. 
SHERIFF Hank? You okay with that? 
HANK Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars? (beat, grins) Damn straight I'm okay with that. 
WAYNE (grumbling, re: Hank) Don't see what we needed him for. 
SHERIFF Then I guess you've never been hunting with Hank. (to Hank) We got two behind that crypt. Get 'em. 
Hank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up the courage to say something. 
PHIL Maybe I'm not okay with it. 
SHERIFF Come on now, Phil. 
PHIL You're gonna kill people? 
SHERIFF They're looters, Phil! They come and steal from an armored truck in our town -- they're looters. (fires two shots) 
PHIL What about Tom? What about Karen? They're not looters. 
SHERIFF No, they're witnesses. 
The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets. 
TOM AND JIM 
Behind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees... 
HANK 
Motor into view. 
JIM 
Opens fire. 
HANK 
Shoots back. 
TOM 
Flattens against the crypt, then turns to see... 
WAYNE 
Coming into view on the other side. 
TOM 
Looks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank. Then he sees... 
RAY 
Floating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants. 
TOM 
Thinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray. 
CLOSE ON JIM 
Shooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun firing from right next to him. He turns to see... 
TOM 
Shooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun. 
WAYNE 
Pulls back out of the line of fire. 
HANK 
Curses and pulls back, too. 
TOM AND JIM 
Exchange a look. 
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT 
PHIL How can you do this? 
SHERIFF Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne was the stupid one. Read my lips. (slowly) Three million dollars. Look at it! 
The Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money. 
SHERIFF A couple of those bags are gonna be yours, Phil. 
PHIL But -- but -- you're the Sheriff!

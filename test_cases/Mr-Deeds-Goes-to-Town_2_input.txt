Look!

What?

That tuba player!

COBB

Have a drink? 
LONGFELLOW 
(distractedly) 
No, thanks. 
Cobb and Cedar exchange a look. 
CEDAR 
Will you have a cigar? 
LONGFELLOW 
No, thank you. 
Cedar sits down. 
CEDAR 
(breaking the silence) 
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me. 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, I wasn't worried about that. 
CEDAR 
No? 
LONGFELLOW 
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band. 
Cobb has just finished taking a drink and can't help but nearly spit it out.

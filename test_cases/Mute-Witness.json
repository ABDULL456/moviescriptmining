Billy walks to the actor playing the murderer, sitting on a prop. She checks his blood device. She takes the knife and plugs a tube coming from the man's shirt on the knife's handle. She explains, by signs, how the knife works, and he nods. Billy fixes something inside his shirt and he reacts when Billy touches his stomach. \nTHE ACTOR Oh ! \nHe smiles. Billy squeezes a small bag full of fake blood. She has just taken that bag from the inside of the man's shirt. The actor keeps on smiling and Billy doesn't seem to like the man's smile. She puts the bag back inside the actor's shirt. Then Billy signs her sister for her to come. Karen joins Billy, who explains to the actor what he has to do, and Karen translates Billy's sign language. \nKAREN You make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with your elbow. Okay ? \nTHE ACTOR Sure. \nKAREN We're gonna be here till Christmas, right ?

Andy sits down on his chair. \nANDY Okay, from the top. \nHis Russian assistant, standing near the camera, with an open ring binder in his hands, says a few words in Russian. We hear an angry voice in the background. \nTHE VOICE Stop. Stop. Stop! \nOn the dining room part of the set, where the young Russian actress broke everything in sight, two men are trying to fix the broken furniture. Another one, a tall man with a beard, talks very angrily in Russian. \nAndy, still seated on his chair, looks at his Russian assistant. \nANDY What's the holdup ? The angry bearded man speaks angrily in Russian. \nAndy looks and listens at him and then turns toward his Russian assistant, trying to speak, but is cut off twice by the angry voice of the man. \nThe bearded Russian man walks away.

Billy is walking backward away from him, but still pointing her knife at him. MALE TELEPHONE OPERATOR Hello ? \nArkadi tears the telephone cord off the telephone handset. He tries to get near Billy, but she is still pointing her knife at him. He pulls the drapes back on the window. \nWalking backward, Billy has reached the wall, in which she bumps. She takes a white statuette on a chest of drawers and throws it at Arkadi. \nArkadi bends down and avoid the statuette, which crashes on the wall behind him. He takes his own knife out of his pocket, a switchblade knife. \nBilly pushes the chest of drawers toward Arkadi. It crashes on the floor, but Arkadi avoids it. Billy is still pointing her knife at Arkadi, when we hears some bumping noise. \nAPARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nIn the bedroom just underneath Billy's apartment, a Russian couple is trying to get some sleep, which, with all the noise in Billy's apartment, is not very easy. \nThe woman is still in the bed, but the man is standing up on the floor, holding a broom with both hands, and hitting the ceiling with the handle of the broom. Both members of the couple swear in Russian. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly, who has understood the situation very well, is hitting the floor with a stick. \nAPARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe man hears the noise made by Billy, and answer by hitting the ceiling with his broom. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly is waving her knife around her, to prevent Arakadi from coming closer to her.

She takes various knives hanging from the wall and throws them at Arkadi, as he tries to enter the kitchen. One knife gets stuck into a painting on the other side of the corridor. Arkadi almost catches Billy, but she jumps through a sort of window set between the kitchen and the living-room. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Billy stands up after her jump through the window, and she slams the door of the corridor in Arkadi's face. This door being a sort of French window, with plenty of small glass panes on it, Arkadi crashes through the door, scattering pieces of glass all over the floor. He falls on the floor. Billy slips on a piece of glass and also falls on the floor. Arkadi tries to catch her by the ankles. She kicks him in the face. He grabs her ankles back. Billy grabs a big white vase from the floor, she sits up and crashes the vase on Arkadi's head. Arkadi lets her go, and she rushes to the front door, but, as she reaches the door, Lyosha comes in. She rushes to the corridor. Arkadi, still a bit groggy, looks at Lyosha with blinking eyes. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nSame high-angle shot, as before, of the bathroom seen from the ceiling. \nBilly enters the bathroom, and locks the door behind her. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Arkadi stands up slowly and walks into the corridor. \n", "test2_true": "Arkadi tries to crash the door open.

A knife blade comes through the door a few inches from Billy's face. Billy goes back to the cabinet and starts searching it again. Eventually she seems to have found what she was looking for : a small disposable razor. \nThe door is shaking under Arkadi's blows. Eventually his hand breaks through the door and tries to find the handle of the door. Billy picks up the toilet brush (the handle of which is a Donald Duck), and hits Arkadi's hand with it. But the door starts falling down under Arkadi's blows. Billy looks through the hole Arkadi has made in the door with his hand. \nThrough the hole, we can see Arkadi going to the end of the corridor, and running back full speed to smash the door. At the last moment, when Arkadi is going to hit the door, Billy opens it. Arkadi can't stop himself, he crosses the bathroom and falls into the full bathtub. Billy hits him on the head with the Donald Duck toilet brush. Then Billy takes the hair-drier, switch it on, and throws it in the bathtub. Arkadi is instantly covered with blue sparks. Then he falls back into the bathtub where he remains motionless. Billy grabs a bunch of clothes and rushes out of the bathroom. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLyosha is looking through Billy's documents scattered on the desk. When Billy comes rushing through the room, he grabs her. She tries to fight him but he locks both of her arms behind her back. He brings her to the desk, and slams her face on the desk. He puts a knife very close to her face. \nLYOSHA Where's the diskette ? \nHe puts a piece of paper and a pen in front of her face. He frees her right hand for her to be able to write.

Billy writes : \u00abWhat diskette ?\u00bb \nLYOSHA I know you have ! \nLyosha raises Billy's bathrobe above her waist, revealing Billy naked bottom underneath. \nBilly looks very frightened, afraid of what Lyosha can do to a defenseless naked girl. She takes the pen very firmly in her hand and brings it violently to Lyosha's leg. \nClose up shot of the pen hitting Lyosha's leg. \nLyosha screams. He raises his knife to bring it down on Billy. Billy is waiting for the worse to happen. She hears the noise of something - or someone - falling violently on the floor. And suddenly, she realizes she is free. She raises from the table and sees Larsen holding Arkadi's big wire-cutter in his hands. He just hit Lyosha with it. Larsen throws the wire-cutter on the floor and bends on Billy. \nLARSEN My name is Alexander Larsen. I'm a policeman. Take your clothes. We must get out of here. \nLarsen goes to the window and peeks through the drapes. \nLARSEN You must hurry. \nBilly rushes to her clothes she had dropped on the floor when Lyosha grabbed her. She sits down on the floor and starts putting her socks on. \nLARSEN I explain everything in the car. \nHe is still peeking through the drapes. \nLARSEN In the car. No time now. \nHe gathers the rest of Billy's clothes, takes her hand to makes her stand up, and drags her outside the apartment. \nBILLY'S LANDING - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThey come out of the apartment and start running along the corridor on Billy's landing.

He gives a quick look at the front door, and closes his eyes, ready to fall asleep. \nThe front door bursts open, and two uniformed policemen enters the room, guns in hand. Lyosha looks at them without moving from his chair, with a sort of look of indifference in his eyes. He shows them the corridor, where we can still hear Andy and Karen yelling in the bedroom. From Lyosha's attitude, we can guess that those policemen are not real ones, but fake ones. \nKAREN (voice over) I can't. I can't ! You hold the door ! \nANDY (voice over) Get out of the way ! \nThe two fake policemen cross the room. \nKAREN (voice over) Come here! Andy! Come here! \nANDY (voice over) Don't yell at me!

One of the fake policeman is searching the room, throwing everything off the shelves on the floor, while the other one is aiming his gun at Andy and Karen. He is leaning on the piano, and he throws all the objects, which are on top of the piano, on the floor. He raises briefly the piano lid, and then starts looking behind the picture hanging on the wall. \nANDY We don't have any diskettes. \nThe policeman picks up a diskette he had thrown on the floor and looks at it. \nANDY Not that one. That's my script. \nKaren hits Andy with her elbow. The policeman puts the diskette into a small white plastic bag he is carrying around. He puts another diskette in the bag.

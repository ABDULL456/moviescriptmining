{"train": "MUTE WITNESS \nScreenplay by \nAnthony Waller \nCREDITS (First part) \nWhite letters on black screen. We hear the sound of a radio with a lot of statics. Apparently, someone is scanning the channels. After we've heard different channels, the scanning stops on a channel with jazz music. \nWith a loud sound, the credits stop, the black screen moves away to the right and is replaced by : \nFILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY (it is actually day-time, but the scene in the film being shot is supposed to take place during the night. So all the artificial lights make us believe it is night-time) \nWe still hear the sound of the radio. \nWe are on a film set, even though we don't know it yet. The way it is filmed makes us believe we are in a real bedroom. \nA bedroom, seen through a window. Nice, clean, elegantly furnished and very well lit. Large bed. On the other side of the room from the window, a young woman is seated in front of desk facing the wall. The young woman stands up, with a paper document in her hand. She is wearing thick hoses, large slippers and a man's white shirt, which hangs down to the middle of her thighs. \nShe walks out of the bedroom, to the next room. The window opens, and the camera, which acts as the eyes of the intruder, looks around the room. \nVOICE ON THE RADIO We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin. \nThe camera moves to the next room : \nFILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film) \nA dining-room with a large mantlepiece. In the center of the room, a round dining table with four chairs around it. The table is set, ready for dinner. \nVOICE ON THE RADIO Ernest Strohbecker and two accomplices escaped from a maximum-security ward in Bellevue Hospital last night... \nThe camera (and consequently the eyes of the intruder) keeps on looking around the room and then focus on the radio set sitting on a small table. \nClose shot on the radio. The volume of the radio goes up. \nVOICE ON THE RADIO ... after brutally stabbing two nurses and a custodian to death. Strohbecker is extremely dangerous, brutal and unpredict... \nThe radio is suddenly switched off. \nThe camera moves upward to show us the corridor and the open door of the bathroom in the corridor. \nTHE YOUNG WOMAN (Voice over) Harry ? \nFILM SET - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film) \nClose shot on the mirror, in front of which the young woman is standing. She looks a bit surprised by the sudden silence of the radio, but very soon goes back to her make-up. \nFILM SET - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film) \nThe camera (and consequently the eyes of the intruder) moves along the corridor, toward the door of the bathroom. It stops very shortly to look at the young woman, still taking care of her make- up, and moves away to look at the open door on the other side of the corridor. \nFILM SET - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film) \nA kitchen. There is no light and the room is very dark. Close shot on the row of knives hanging on the wall. A man's hand takes one of the knives. \nFILM SET - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film) \nThe young woman opens a small closet, temporarily hiding her face to the camera. She takes a lipstick and start doing her lips. \nClose-up shot on the woman's lips, with the lipstick moving around them. \nBack to the mirror, showing the reflection of the young woman. She opens the small closet. In the mirror, which covers the door of the closet, we see a man approaching slowly, with a knife in his hand. \nClose-up shot on the woman's lips. \nFILM SET - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film) \nHigh-angle shot of the corridor, seen from the ceiling. \nThe woman comes out of the bathroom. She sees something, stops and walks slightly backward. \nTHE YOUNG WOMAN Harry ? She walks to an half-open door and closes the door. \nBack to Karen and Billy. Billy represses a laughter behind her hand. \nClose shot on Lyosha, a young assistant camera operator, looking at Billy and smiling. Then close shot on Billy's face. \nThe actress holds the drapes of the nearest window. She falls down on the floor tearing the drapes and breaking the curtain-rod off the wall. \nKaren and Billy are both laughing silently. \nThe actress gets slowly out from under the torn drapes. \nLyosha looks at the actress, and then at Billy. \nBilly looks at the actress, and then at Lyosha. \nClose up shot on Lyosha's face, smiling. \nBilly walks behind Karen's back to the other side of Karen. Karen looks at her, and then looks in the direction into which Billy is looking. Lyosha keeps on smiling. \nKaren whispers in Billy's ear. \nKAREN (whispering) He has the hots for you. \nBilly answers in sign language. We understand that Billy cannot speak, but she isn't deaf. \nBILLY (in sign language) For me ? No. \nThe actress, half-covered with the drape, drags the curtain-rod behind her. \nBilly is smiling and Karen is looking at the scene with her mouth half open. \nClose shot on a smiling bearded film crew member. The camera then moves to the right, to an open ring binder, with a hand following whatever is written on the document. The camera keeps on panning on the right, showing part of instruments and people's hands, while we hear some whining noises coming from the actress. \nEND OF CREDITS \nThe camera stops on a close shot on Andy Clarke's face. Andy is the film director. \nThe actress looks like a ghost with the drape covering her. She slowly falls down on the floor, among the mess she has created by breaking and dropping every prop in sight. \nAndy looks thunderstruck by what he sees on the set. \nClose up shot on the camera. A button just switched off, showing that there is no more film inside the camera. \nAndy looks at the camera and sighs. \nANDY Cut. Brilliant. \nHe puts his hands on his eyes. \nThe actress, still lying on the floor under the drape, raises the drape to look at Andy. \nANDY (yelling) Natasha ! \nHe stands up. \nBoth Andy and Natasha, the interpreter, walks toward the still lying actress and squats around her. \nANDY Okay, I think we have a little communication gap here. Natasha translates in Russian what Andy just said. \nANDY When I said \u00abmore\u00bb... \nNatasha translates. \nANDY ...I didn't mean trash the fucking set. \nNatasha translates. \nANDY This is not Chekhov. You're not the star. You're just another victim. \nNatasha translates. \nThe actress tries to understand what Andy tells her through Natasha. ANDY You get stabbed. You die. \nNatasha translates \nBilly drops the spear on the floor and runs away from the window. \nCINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nA large corridor. A door opens and Billy rushes out. She opens a door at the end of the corridor and runs out. \nCINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT The gallery around the top of the set. A door opens and Billy runs along the gallery. \nAt ground level, we see Billy coming down the stairs leading to the gallery. Billy runs across the film set, which seems not to have been used recently. \nBilly reaches a heavy metal door and tries to open it... without any success. She kicks it. \nCINEMA STUDIO - ANOTHER ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe parking lot seen trough the heavy metal bars of a door. It is darker than before and completely empty. Close-up shot on an big padlock and a thick chain set across the bars of the door. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWe hear very loud rock music. \nClose shot on the gas stove. Ground meat is cooking in a frying pan. Chopped onions are being poured into another frying pan from a wooden cutting board. \nAndy is spraying some spices on the meat. He is wearing an apron tied around his waist. He tastes his \u00abcuisine\u00bb from a spoon. He is bobbing up an down in rhythm with the music. Andy makes the round spice rack spin around very fast and picks up a jar from the rack. Then he pours spices from two different jars with both hands, in rhythm with the music, miming a drummer beating his drums with his sticks. Then he pours tomato sauce from a can into a saucepan. He throws the empty can away. \nANDY Yeah ! \nHe takes another spice jar. But the lid of the jar comes off, and all the spices fall down into the meat. He puts the empty jar down. \nANDY Damn ! \nHe takes the lid off the meat. We hear the phone ringing. Andy lowers the volume of the music from the radio set hanging on the wall. The phone is still ringing. \nANDY Honey ! Honey, can you get that ? \nAndy takes the meat frying pan out of the stove to pour the meat into the onions frying pan. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe kitchen seen from the dark living room. There is no door between kitchen and living room, just a wide open arch. The phone is still ringing. Andy turns around. \nANDY Honey ! \nKAREN (voice over) I'm in the shower ! \nAndy puts the frying pan back on the stove and runs in the living- room. He picks up the phone from a table. \nANDY Hello ?... Hello ? \nCINEMA STUDIO - A ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose dark shot of Billy with the telephone handset to her ear. She taps on the microphone of the handset. The telephone set is on a small shelf fixed on the wall. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nEven if the volume of the radio has been lowered, it is still loud enough for Andy not to be able to hear Billy's tapping. A hissing sound, coming from the kitchen, makes him turn around. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nOn the stove, a big stew pot is hissing, and water is leaking between the lid and the pot. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAndy takes the telephone set and runs toward the kitchen. But the cord is a bit too short and is stretched tight just when he reaches the kitchen. He drops the telephone set on the floor. \nANDY Hello ? \nHe tries to reach the stove control panel while still holding the telephone handset to his ear. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAndy's hand is trying to reach the control panel of the stove. \nCINEMA STUDIO - A ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLyosha walks slowly toward Billy. He tries to open a door, but it is locked. We hear him talking in Russian. \nBilly is still hidden behind the red vending machine. \nLYOSHA Hello ? \nLyosha keeps on walking slowly toward Billy. \nLYOSHA Is anyone there ? \nLyosha is looking at the far end of the corridor. He crosses toward a door. \nLYOSHA I can explain. \nHe opens the door and walks inside the room. \nBilly peeks cautiously from behind the machine, and sees the open door. She runs toward the emergency exit. She breaks the glass with her hand and grabs the key. \nLYOSHA (voice over) Ho ? \nBilly runs back toward the vending machine, behind which she hides again. \nLyosha walks out of the room, leaving the door open, and looks at the far end of the corridor. \nBilly is still hidden behind the vending machine. Lyosha is coming toward her. Billy moves slowly along the wall, keeping her back as close as possible of the wall. She opens a door and enters a dark room. She closes the door behind her. \nLyosha reaches the vending machine, and starts running toward the emergency exit. He stops near the emergency box with its broken glass. He looks inside the emergency box. His finger comes out of the box, with the tip covered with Billy's blood. He tries to open the emergency door, which is locked. \nCINEMA STUDIO - STORE ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nA dark store room, with large windows. The door opens and Lyosha walks in. He runs to the window. He looks outside, but seeing nothing significant, he turns around and walks a couple of steps inside the room. He stops and looks around. He starts walking again across the room. Suddenly something catches his eye. \nClose shot on the bottom of a long drape. There is a thin space between the bottom of the drape and the floor. And on this thin space, the tip of a shoe is showing. Lyosha walks slowly toward the drape. He pulls the drape open with a very quick movement. Several racks of shoes were actually hidden by the drape. \nCINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT \nA door opens in the back of the room and Billy walks in the room. There is some light coming from the door. Billy walks to the main door of the room and opens it. She raises her arm and grabs the bell at the top of the door to silence it. She walks out of the room. \nCINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe long corridor. The lights are still on. Billy walks out of her workshop and closes the door. She starts running along the corridor toward the emergency exit. She suddenly stops, when she hears a door opening. She runs back toward the staircase and hides near the entrance of the staircase. In the background, we see Lyosha coming out of a room. The camera pans toward the staircase and Billy. A door opens on the floor below, and the large shadow of a man is projected on the wall of the staircase. Billy runs on the other side of the landing, while the man starts climbing the stairs. He is Arkadi, the electrician working on Andy's film, and the one who was playing with a spotlight on Billy's face. He is bare-chested, which makes us believe he was the poor actress' murderer. He reaches the landing and stops. \nBilly is still hiding in a dark corner. She sees Arkadi coming on the landing. \nARKADI Lyosha ! Lyosha is coming to meet Arkadi. They speak in Russian. \nBilly looks at the two men, then she moves silently away from them. She reaches the door of the elevator, which is supposed to be out of order, and opens it. She puts the key of the emergency exit door in her mouth, and start climbing down the elevator shaft emergency ladder. \nCINEMA STUDIO - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly climbs down the emergency ladder, trying not to miss the steps. \nHer face is now on the level of the bottom of the door of the elevator. There is a small gap between the bottom of the door and the floor, which enables Billy to peek at what is going on in the corridor. \nA shoe appears in the gap between the door and the floor. \nClose shot on the small window at the top of the elevator door. Arkadi's face appears in the window. He looks around inside the elevator shaft. \nBilly is not in front of the gap anymore, but hiding in the dark. She puts the key in front of the gap. \nArkadi tries to open the door of the elevator. But it is locked. The blood on his hand proves that Arkadi was actually the poor actress' murderer. Through the small window, he looks around in the shaft. \nBilly tries not to be seen through the gap. \nArkadi still looks around in the shaft. He turns his head to talk in Russian to Lyosha. \nBilly has got the key back between her teeth. We hear the two men talking in Russian. \nArkadi's face moves away from the window. Some lights are switched off, making the window slightly darker. \nBilly moves away from the wall of the shaft and falls. She catches the elevator cables. \nClose shot on Billy's face. She is holding the cables. She makes a face because of the pain. She doesn't have the key in her mouth anymore. \nCINEMA STUDIO - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly climbs down the shaft. \nCINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT Arkadi walks away in the basement. Billy slowly comes out of the elevator door and runs away in the opposite direction from Arkadi. She hides behind a pillar, because she sees Arkadi's lamp in the background. Arkadi is coming back, and Billy moves around the pillar to be hidden from Arkadi's eyes. Arkadi stops near the elevator. He opens the elevator's door. \nBilly runs away. She trips on something and makes a little noise. She stops. \nArkadi, coming out of the elevator, looks in Billy's direction. \nBilly opens a door and walks out. \nArkadi slowly walks away from the elevator door. \nThe door closes smoothly behind Billy. \nCINEMA STUDIO - STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly is walking rapidly upstairs. \nCINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe door of the set opens and Billy walks in. She walks slowly through the set, looking around her. Suddenly, the big spotlights are switched on one by one. \nIn the electricians' control cabin, we see Lyosha switching the lights on. More spotlights are switched on. \nBilly is running around on the set, trying to avoid the lights. She reaches the scenery and jumps out of one of the scenery windows. \nA searchlight, controlled by Lyosha. The searchlight is following Billy. Billy tries to avoid the searchlight. She runs away toward the exit of the set. She meets Arkadi coming back on the set, but she keeps on running. \nARKADI Billy ! \nBilly starts climbing a ladder, but before climbing, she pushes a heavy piece of furniture to block the bottom of the ladder. The piece of furniture falling down makes other props fall down. Arkadi starts moving the props out of his way. He reaches the bottom the ladder. \nARKADI Wait. I explain. \nHe starts climbing the ladder, turning his head around to yell : \nARKADI Lyosha ! In the electricians' control cabin, hearing his name, Lyosha looks outside the cabin. \nARKADI (voice over) Lyosha ! \nHe says a few words in Russian. \nA gallery near the ceiling of the set. Billy is running along the gallery. \nLyosha runs out of the electricians' control cabin and on the gallery. \nBilly runs down a few steps and outside the room. From the other side of the gallery, Lyosha comes running after her. \nCINEMA STUDIO - STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLyosha runs downstairs. \nCINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe long dark corridor, with the staircase in the foreground. Lyosha runs in the corridor from the staircase, but before entering the corridor, he switches the lights on. With the lights on, we can see Billy running away to the far end of the corridor. Lyosha runs after her. \nZoom on the emergency door, coming closer to us. \nBilly is running toward the door. \nBilly puts the key in the keyhole. She opens the emergency door and shuts it behind her. \nLyosha runs toward the door. He pushes it open. CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe other side of the door, opening on a small gallery leading to the emergency ladders set along the exterior wall of the building. \nThe door is been violently pushed open by Lyosha. With Lyosha's violent push, Billy falls backward, above the balcony of the gallery and down on the yard below. \nBilly falls on her back on a huge pile of used film metal boxes. \nLyosha bends over the balcony and looks down at Billy. \nKaren turns toward Andy. \nKAREN Andy, go with the janitor... \nLyosha seems worried. \nKAREN (voice over) ...and fetch an ambulance ! \nAndy joined the janitor with his dog. \nKAREN (voice over) Billy's had an accident. ANDY What ? \nLyosha says something in Russian to the janitor. \nKAREN (voice over) Don't just stand there ! \nKaren looks at Andy. \nKAREN Do it now ! \nThe dog barks. Andy turns toward the janitor \nANDY Ambulance ! \nThe janitor answers in Russian. The dog keeps on barking. Andy pushes the janitor toward his office. \nANDY Come on ! \nThey both walk away. \nKaren bends over Billy. \nKAREN It's all right, sweetie. \nBilly is still moving restlessly. \nKAREN I'm here now and an ambulance is on its way. \nKaren pushes Lyosha's hand away. KAREN Let go of her. She's trying to say something. \nLyosha stands up. Billy talks to Karen with her hand. \nKAREN Police ? \nBilly keeps on signing. \nKAREN Murder ? \nShe looks up at Lyosha. \nLyosha shrugs his shoulders and makes a face that means he doesn't know what Billy is talking about. \nKAREN Andy ! Andy ! CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThis the set where the poor actress was brutally murdered. \nBilly is seated between Karen and Andy. She has a disoriented look on her face, and a blanket is wrapped around her shoulders. Karen is tenderly stroking Billy's shoulder. We hear some laughing and people talking in Russian. \nLyosha and Arkadi are talking to an uniformed Russian policeman, who seems to be in charge of the inquiry. Consequently, he will be, from now on, mentioned as \u00abFirst Policeman\u00bb \nThe other policeman (who shall be mentioned as \u00abSecond Policeman\u00bb) is kneeling down, looking at something on the floor, and the janitor is standing in a corner with his dog on a leash. \nLyosha, Arkadi and the first policeman are still talking together. They slowly walk toward the rest of the group. The second policeman, who was still kneeling down, stands up. \nBilly is listening to Lyosha, apparently trying to lip-read and understand what he says. Lyosha turns toward her. \nLYOSHA Excuse me. It's true. We just fake murder. If we really want to murder... \nThe two uniformed policemen are listening to Lyosha. \nLYOSHA (voice over) ...why make film of it ? \nLyosha and Arkadi both laugh. \nThe first policeman looks at the two men, and speaks in Russian to them. \nArkadi and Lyosha both look slightly embarrassed. Lyosha starts walking away. \nKaren looks, with a worried eye, to the departing Lyosha. \nKAREN Wait. Stop ! Karen runs after Lyosha. \nKAREN He could expose the film. \nThe first policeman takes Lyosha's arm and talks to him in Russian. \nFIRST POLICEMAN Let her do it. Please. \nKAREN Okay. \nKaren starts working on the hermetic bag used as a portable dark room. Karen puts her arms inside the bag. \nKAREN This lets you unload the film without needing a darkroom. \nFIRST POLICEMAN I see. Close shot on Arkadi's face. He looks very menacing. \nAndy starts taking his jacket off. \nANDY (whispering) God, it's hot in here. \nIn the background, Arkadi is bending down on something we don't see. He looks up at Karen. \nKAREN (voice over) If he had exposed the film to the light, he could have destroyed all the evidence. \nBilly looks at Arkadi, still busy doing something that we don't see. \nKAREN (voice over) Actually, I haven't done this since film school. \nArkadi stands up from whatever he was doing. \nKAREN (voice over) Right. It's safe in the can now. \nArkadi walks around the group. \nKAREN (voice over) Here. Take it to the lab immediately... \nClose shot on Arkadi walking away. \nKAREN (voice over) ...for developing. \nBilly, who understands something wrong is going on with Arkadi, stamps her feet. Karen gives the film to the first policeman. \nKAREN It's okay... It's okay. \nArkadi is walking slowly with something that looks like a knife in his hand. We hear Billy clapping her hands. Andy turns around to look at Billy. \nBilly points to Arkadi and tries to explain something in sign language. \nKaren looks at Billy. \nKAREN Murder weapon ? Where ? \nArkadi grabs Andy and pushes him against the wall. \nKaren screams. Arkadi stabs Andy in the stomach with his knife. Andy screams. He has blood on his cheek. Arkadi keeps on stabbing Andy. \nThe first policeman takes his gun out of his belt. \nBoth policemen grab Arkadi from behind. They pull him away from Andy. They have both drown their guns. \nKaren rushes toward Andy, whose shirt is covered with blood. \nKaradi, still restrained by the two policemen, is yelling in Russian. \nLYOSHA (voice over) Stop. Stop. Stop! \nArkadi drops his knife, and it remains attached to his wrist by a plastic tube. Actually, it was a fake prop knife. \nKAREN Oh ! Wait. Wait. Ah ! She says... Well, there were more bags in there before. \nThe first policeman seems a bit fed up with Billy. \nARKADI No, she's right. I will show you. \nCINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThey are all coming out of the basement on a ramp that reaches the yard and the parking lot around the building. Arkadi is leading them. ARKADI From lift shaft we take the rubbish here. Fast. Easy. \nThe janitor says something in Russian. They have reached the large plastic trash containers where all the trashes from the studio are dropped off, waiting for the garbage collectors to take them away. The second policeman raises the lid of a container, while the first policeman looks inside. Arkadi takes a bag out of another container and drops it on the ground. The second policeman looks inside the bag with his flashlight. There seems to be a head inside the bag. The policeman pours the content of the bag on the ground. Actually the head was just a mask ! \nANDY Hey, we need that. \nHe picks up the mask from the rubbish. He wipes it with his hand. The first policeman gives his card to both Billy and Karen. \nFIRST POLICEMAN Sorry, I can do nothing for you now. But I will call you after I see the film. Okay ? Sorry. He walks away. The second policeman shakes hands with Arkadi and Lyosha and goes away with his chief. \nBilly rests her head on Karen's shoulder. \nLyosha looks at her, shrugs and smiles. \nANDY'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose up shot on Billy's face, seated in the back of the car. She looks very sad and disappointed. \nAndy is driving, with Karen seated next to him. \nANDY Well, I've never been more embarrassed in my entire life. \nKAREN I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro. She'd know the difference between a real murder and a gag. \nANDY Please, has she even seen a real murder ? \nKAREN That's my point. If what she saw tonight was real, then she has seen the difference, right ? \nANDY Oh, come on, honey. We all bought the guy cutting me up tonight. Even I believed it. \nKAREN Because you're a wuss. \nShe laughs. ANDY I'm gonna let that slide. \nKaren looks at Billy. \nANDY No offense, Billy, but I'd like to re-shoot the stuff today using that guy's knife. \nKAREN It was her knife. God ! \nA very short flash-back sequence of the murder of the actress. \nANDY Whatever. It looked good. \nAnother very short flash-back. We understand those short flash- backs come from Billy's mind reliving what she saw a couple of hours before. \nKaren, looking at Billy, seems to understand what's going on inside her sister's head, because she says to Andy : \nKAREN Shut up. \nMore short flash-backs of the murder, and a close-up shot on Billy's face. She seems very disturbed. \nCINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe janitor is patrolling the basement with his dog. He is carrying an electric torch. \nHe checks a heavy metal door, which is closed. \nWhile he is checking the door, the dog runs away. \nThe janitor looks around him. \nJANITOR Buka ! \nHe is apparently calling his dog, but he gets no answer. He starts looking around. \nThe chimney of the studio seen from the parking lot in a low-angle shot. A lot of black smoke is coming out of it, certainly from the incinerator. \nLyosha is smoking on the ramp leading to the basement, and he, like the chimney, exhales a lot of smoke, but white one ! \nThe door of the basement opens and Arkadi walks out. There seems to be a lot of smoke in the basement too. He coughs. Lyosha throws him a pack of cigarettes, which he catches. He spits, takes a cigarette out of the pack and lights it. Two cars are coming toward them. The fist one is a large black limousine. \nLyosha picks up a small plastic bag. \nThe cars stop near the ramp. Arkadi and Lyosha walk toward them. A man gets out of the front passenger door of the second car. He is Wartschuk, the Big Boss' first assistant. He closes the door and walks toward Lyosha and Arkadi. Lyosha gives him the plastic bag. The man says a few words in Russian and nods toward the limousine. He walks away, but Lyosha doesn't move. \nA man is sitting in the back of the limousine, his face hidden in the dark. He is called \u00abThe Reaper\u00bb and he is the famous \u00abBig Boss\u00bb of the whole criminal organization, and consequently of Arkadi and Lyosha. \nTHE REAPER Come closer, Mr. Hausmann. I won't bite. \nLyosha starts walking slowly toward the car. THE REAPER (voice over) Did it go smoothly ? \nLYOSHA About the money... \nTHE REAPER Did it go smoothly ? \nLYOSHA Yes, of course. No problem. \nThe Reaper bends slightly, so his face appears in the light. \nTHE REAPER Did it go smoothly, Mr. Hausmann ? \nLYOSHA We did our job. The condition was... \nTHE REAPER The condition was that everything would go smoothly. \nLYOSHA Yes. Yes, and we have your diskette. \nTHE REAPER And who informed the police ? \nLYOSHA American girl say something, but nobody believe her. \nTHE REAPER As long as there are witnesses, there's no money. \nLYOSHA You mean ?... THE REAPER I think we understand each other, Mr. Hausmann. \nThe Reaper winds his car window up. Then he sits back in his seat. \nLyosha and Arkadi look at the two cars driving away. \nLyosha gives a folded paper to Arkadi, who unfolds it. \nClose up shot on the paper. It shows Billy's address and telephone number. \nA STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nLow-angle shot on the buildings around the street. Then the camera tilts down to street level. Andy's car drives toward us and stops. Billy opens the back door and walks out of the car. Karen opens the driver's door and walks out. Both sisters close their doors. Billy starts walking toward her building and Karen follows her. \nKAREN No, honestly, you can come back to our place, and we'll set up the couch if you want. \nAndy has remained in the car. \nBilly answers her sister in sign language. \nKAREN You're not on one of your \u00abI'll show her how independent I am\u00bb kicks, are you ? \nAndy has got out of the car and is watching the two sister, leaning on the roof of the car. \nANDY Honey, you coming or what ? \nBilly waves to Andy and enters her building. Karen looks at her sister and then turns toward Andy. \nKAREN Andy, don't you care about her ? \nAndy looks offended by Karen's words. \nANDY I don't care ? I don't care ? Fine, fine. I'm calling the American Embassy tonight, okay ? \nBilly has stopped near her building door and is looking at Karen and Andy's verbal fight. \nClose up shot on the gas flames of the water heater. \nBilly is getting ready to take a bath. She is just wearing a bath towel wrapped around her body. With her hand, she tests the temperature of the bath water. She pours some bubble-bath from a big bottle into the water. We hear the telephone ringing. Billy turns her head toward the living-room \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe apartment is a bit ancient-looking. It doesn't \u00ablook like\u00bb Billy. One can tell it is only a rented apartment for a short period. Various clothes are scattered around the room. \nBilly walks from the bathroom along the corridor to the living- room. The telephone keeps on ringing. \nThe telephone and the special answering machine are set on a small table. Billy picks up the telephone handset and puts it on the machine. Then she sits down on a chair and puts a pair of earphone on her ears. Finally, she presses a button on the machine. \nClose up shot on the screen of the machine. It looks a bit like a computer screen. The machine offers the choice between different sentences : \u00abHello\u00bb \u00abHello this is Billy Hughes speaking\u00bb \u00abI am using a digital voice computer\u00bb \u00abPlease have patience and I will answer\u00bb \u00abMy address is apartment 923 - 126 Kievsky Prospekt\u00bb \u00abMy telephone number is 9205910\u00bb etc. Billy chooses the second choice, using a ball-mat. Then she brings the arrow on an icon to start the machine. \nDIGITAL VOICE Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking. \nMomentarily, the scene is seen through a binocular, which makes us realize that Billy is been spied by someone. \nBilly, apparently getting no answer but a deep breathing noise, chooses the first choice. \nDIGITAL VOICE Hello. \nA shot on the large bay window makes us guess where the spy is hiding : somewhere across the street. DIGITAL VOICE Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking. \nBilly keeps on trying to get an answer. \nDIGITAL VOICE Hello. \nBut she gets only a disconnection tone. She takes the earphone out of her ears, and puts them on the table. She looks at the window. \nShot on the window, with a zoom on another window across the street. Behind that window, we see the figure of a man looking at Billy with binoculars. \nBilly seen through the \u00abneighbor's\u00bb binoculars. She walks to the window and pull the drapes to hide the window. \nThe \u00abspy\u00bb sees the drapes being pulled through his binoculars. \nPOLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT The same men are still in the projection room. The first policeman has taken his cap off. And Larsen is now seated in a seat behind Lovett. \nFIRST POLICEMAN Have you seen a... how do you say... snuff film before ? \nLARSEN I saw a woman tied to a tree   kept alive while her arms and legs were cut off. It's hard   to talk about it, or even think about it. And it makes   you sick to watch it. You never forget the look in the   victim's eyes. The sheer panic and horror when they realize   they're about to die. \nLovett looks very disturbed by what Larsen just told him. The technician knocks on the window between his cabin and the room. Larsen and Lovett turn around, and Larsen makes a sign to tell the technician to start the film. Then he takes a cigarette from the pack he left on his former seat. The room becomes dark and the projection starts. The four men watch the film which has no sound. \nOn the screen of the projection room, we see the sequence when the young actress, pretending she is dying very slowly, breaks the whole set. \nLovett and Larsen turn their head toward the cabin. \nPOLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION CABIN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe technician is also watching the film through the window between the two rooms. When he sees Larsen looking at him, he shrugs to tell him that he is not responsible for what is shown on the screen. \nPOLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLarsen and Lovett turn back to watch the screen. On the screen, the sequence when the young actress is pulling the tablecloth away from the table, and also everything that was on the table. \nThe two policemen are smiling because they find what they see on the screen quite funny. \nLovett and Larsen do not smile, because they are disappointed. \nNow, on the screen, the actress is pulling the drapes down from the windows. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren, wearing her night-gown, is seated on the edge of the bed. We hear Andy talking into the telephone. \nANDY (voice over) Yes, sir... No, sir. \nAndy is walking up and down in the next room, carrying the telephone set in his hand and with the handset on his ear. ANDY Right... Right... Right, sir. Right, sir. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. So, I really appreciate the call. I'll give Dad your best. Right. \nHe puts the phone down back on its hook. \nKaren has a worried look on her face. \nBilly is looking through the peephole on the door. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren is looking worried. \nKAREN Billy ? You be careful, now. Check who it is first. \nKaren's louder voice has awaken Andy, who sits up. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly is still looking through the peephole. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LANDING OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe landing, just outside Billy's apartment front door, is dark and empty. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly, still looking in the peephole, moves her head from right to left, trying to see further on the landing. She slowly moves away from the door to a small table by the door. \nClose up shot on the table, and a business card lying on it. It is the first policeman's card. It says : \u00abPolice Inspector Vladimir Pekar - Precinct 22\u00bb and underneath an address and a telephone number. \nBilly is still standing near the door. She puts the safety chain on. And then she slowly opens the door. Arkadi appears behind the door. Billy tries to shut the door, but he puts his foot between the door and the wall. \nARKADI Please. I want to talk. \nDesperately, Billy tries to push the door shut. \nClose up on the earphones on the machine keyboard. \nKAREN (voice over from the telephone) Billy ? \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren seems very excited. \nKAREN Billy, are you still there ? \nANDY Would you leave her alone ? \nHe lies back in the bed. \nKAREN I heard a noise, Andy. Something's happened. I swear. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly is trying to push the door shut. Arkadi has a big wire- cutter in his hand. He brings the cutter near the chain. Billy takes an umbrella from the stand near the door, and, with it, tries to prevent Arkadi from cutting the chain. Arkadi cuts the tip of the umbrella off. With her slippered foot, Billy kicks Arkadi's foot still jamming the door, but it doesn't move it off. Then she takes the heavy metal umbrella stand and hits Arkadi's foot with it. Arkadi removes his foot from the door. Billy can - at last - slam the door shut. She leans on it, panting. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren is now very frightened. She yells in the phone. \nKAREN Billy ! \nShe puts the phone down and stands up from the bed. \nKAREN Okay, that's it. I'm going there. \nAndy sits up on the bed. \nANDY What ? \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Billy is still leaning on the door, panting. We hear the noise of an electric machine. Billy's eyes widen with horror. She rushes to the telephone, and starts typing frenetically. \nDIGITAL VOICE Karen, help. Call police. Emergency. \nClose up shot on the door lock. We can guess that Arkadi is trying to open the door with a power tool. \nBilly puts her earphone on. She hears the disconnection tone. She presses the disconnection switch on her own telephone. \nClose up shot on the door lock. One of the screws holding the lock pops off and falls on the floor. \nReverse angle shot on the window where the peeping-Tom was standing when he was watching Billy. There is light coming through the window and someone is moving in the room behind the curtains, but the peeping-Tom doesn't seem interested by Billy at the moment. \nBack to Billy's window. She unties her bathrobe and shows her breasts. The peeping-Tom is still moving in the room behind the curtains, but he doesn't come to the window. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly is standing in front of the window, with her bathrobe wide open, revealing her naked body to whomever wants to watch it ! \nClose up on the lock. Another screw is vibrating and pops off. We see the drill bit coming through the hole it just made. \nBilly hears a male voice coming from her earphones. \nMALE TELEPHONE OPERATOR Hello ? Hello ? \nBilly picks up the earphones and put them on her ears. \nTELEPHONE OPERATOR I speak English. \nThe door burst open and Arkadi walks into the room. Billy picks up her big kitchen knife and points it to Arkadi. \nMALE TELEPHONE OPERATOR Are you okay ? \nArkadi presses the light switch to dim the lights in the room. \nClose up shot on the earphones. \nMALE TELEPHONE OPERATOR If you just give your address, we send somebody immediately. \nArkadi is walking slowly inside the room. Billy is walking backward away from him, but still pointing her knife at him. MALE TELEPHONE OPERATOR Hello ? \nArkadi tears the telephone cord off the telephone handset. He tries to get near Billy, but she is still pointing her knife at him. He pulls the drapes back on the window. \nWalking backward, Billy has reached the wall, in which she bumps. She takes a white statuette on a chest of drawers and throws it at Arkadi. \nArkadi bends down and avoid the statuette, which crashes on the wall behind him. He takes his own knife out of his pocket, a switchblade knife. \nBilly pushes the chest of drawers toward Arkadi. It crashes on the floor, but Arkadi avoids it. Billy is still pointing her knife at Arkadi, when we hears some bumping noise. \nAPARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nIn the bedroom just underneath Billy's apartment, a Russian couple is trying to get some sleep, which, with all the noise in Billy's apartment, is not very easy. \nThe woman is still in the bed, but the man is standing up on the floor, holding a broom with both hands, and hitting the ceiling with the handle of the broom. Both members of the couple swear in Russian. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly, who has understood the situation very well, is hitting the floor with a stick. \nAPARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe man hears the noise made by Billy, and answer by hitting the ceiling with his broom. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly is waving her knife around her, to prevent Arakadi from coming closer to her. She throws the knife at him. Arkadi bends his head and the knife hits the piano. \nClose up of the piano keyboard, with the knife stuck between two keys. \nBilly rushes out of the room, closing the door behind her. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly rushes into the kitchen. She takes various knives hanging from the wall and throws them at Arkadi, as he tries to enter the kitchen. One knife gets stuck into a painting on the other side of the corridor. Arkadi almost catches Billy, but she jumps through a sort of window set between the kitchen and the living-room. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Billy stands up after her jump through the window, and she slams the door of the corridor in Arkadi's face. This door being a sort of French window, with plenty of small glass panes on it, Arkadi crashes through the door, scattering pieces of glass all over the floor. He falls on the floor. Billy slips on a piece of glass and also falls on the floor. Arkadi tries to catch her by the ankles. She kicks him in the face. He grabs her ankles back. Billy grabs a big white vase from the floor, she sits up and crashes the vase on Arkadi's head. Arkadi lets her go, and she rushes to the front door, but, as she reaches the door, Lyosha comes in. She rushes to the corridor. Arkadi, still a bit groggy, looks at Lyosha with blinking eyes. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nSame high-angle shot, as before, of the bathroom seen from the ceiling. \nBilly enters the bathroom, and locks the door behind her. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Arkadi stands up slowly and walks into the corridor. \nSECOND FLOOR LANDING - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLarsen and Billy are coming from the third floor and start going downstairs toward the first landing. The elevator is going up with two people inside. They look very much like Andy and Karen. \nSTREET IN FRONT OF BILLY'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nLarsen and Billy are coming out of the building. \nLARSEN Quick. \nLarsen's car is parked just in front of the building. Larsen opens the passenger's door for Billy, who climbs inside the car. Then he walks around the car, open the driver's door and climbs inside. He starts the engine. \nA big black limousine, with two men inside, starts and follows Larsen's car, which has just started. The driver is Wartschuk, whom we have seen before with The Reaper, and who is The Reaper's first assistant. \nLARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLarsen gives a quick look in the rear-view mirror. \nWe see the headlights of the other car through the back window of the car. \nBilly resumes her dressing. When she puts her white sweater on, without a bra, her breasts are showing. Larsen gives a quick glance toward her, and then turns his head away. Billy looks back at him, smiles and kisses him on the cheek. \nLARSEN It's not over yet. Billy puts her jacket on. Larsen looks in the back-view mirror. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren and Andy enter the apartment and stop when they see the mess around them. We realize that it was really them and not some gangsters going up in the elevator. \nKAREN My... \nANDY Oh, my God, it's trashed ! \nKaren rushes through the room. Andy remains on the doorstep. \nKAREN Billy, where are you ? \nANDY I'll call the police ! \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren is running through the corridor. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAndy picks up the telephone handset without noticing that the cord has been cut. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren is checking all the rooms to find her sister \nKAREN Billy ! Oh, Billy. Oh, my God ! BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAndy is still trying to get a dialing tone \nANDY How do you work this thing ? Oh, there it is. \nBehind Andy, the front door is closing slowly, revealing Lyosha standing behind it. He has the big wire-cutter in his hand, and is ready to hit Andy with it. Andy looks at the cut cord, but doesn't realize the telephone can't work with a cut cord. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren enters the bathroom \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWe hear Karen screaming. Andy puts the telephone down on the table and rushes across the room \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT Karen is coming out of the bathroom, screaming. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAndy walks toward the corridor, but Karen meets him at the door. \nKAREN Someone's dead in the ba... \nTHE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWartschuk is answering the fake policeman on his own walkie- talkie. Next to him, his passenger is screwing a silencer on his gun. \nA STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe street is empty at this time of the night, but for the two cars following each other. \nLARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLARSEN The girl had it when she went into the studio. Then she was murdered, and it was gone. Where is it ? Think. You were the only person there. \nClose up shot on Billy's face trying to think about the mysterious diskette. She has a short flashback of Arkadi taking the knife to murder the actress. Then another one of the naked actress lying on the bed. Then another one of the blood splattering the wall. Then another one of Arkadi stabbing the girl. \nLARSEN Think. \nAnother short flashback of Billy going away from the   set. Then another one of Billy bumping into the hatstand. Then   another one of the girl's purse contents scattered on the floor.   Then another one of the diskette skidding on the floor and hiding   under the large wooden wardrobe. \nBilly grabs Larsen's shoulder. \nLARSEN Write. Write it. \nBilly takes a notepad and starts writing on it. But she is interrupted by a Russian voice coming from somewhere in the car. Larsen opens the glove compartment and takes a walkie-talkie out of it. He talks in Russian in the talkie. \nBilly looks at the pair of handcuffs in the glove compartment. \nLarsen puts the talkie back in the compartment. \nLARSEN Write it. \nThey drive along a police station, but Larsen doesn't stop. Billy looks a bit worried all of sudden. \nLARSEN Quick, write. \nBilly shows the police station to Larsen. Then she writes \u00abPolice\u00bb on the notepad. \nLARSEN Police ? Yes. Yes, but only with the diskette. \nShe writes \u00abWhy ?\u00bb on the notepad. \nLARSEN You know, I work undercover. The Reaper thinks I work for him. Trust me. Trust me. \nShe grabs the steering-wheel to force Larsen to park the car. THE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThrough the car windshield, we see Larsen's car zigzagging on the street. The two passenger talks in Russian \nLARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly is trying to force Larsen to stop the car. \nLARSEN Crazy ! \nTHE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThrough the windshield, we see Larsen's car stopping near the sidewalk. The two men talk nervously in Russian. \nLARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly hits Larsen violently on his private parts. Larsen moans. Billy takes the handcuffs out of the glove compartment and ties Larsen's hand on the steering-wheel. \nTHE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe two men look at Larsen's parked car. They see the passenger door being opened. \nLARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly opens the door and gets out of the car. \nLARSEN They'll kill you ! \nBilly shows him the handcuffs key. Then she slams the door. Larsen moves his hand nervously, but, of course, can't get it out of the handcuff. \nA STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly looks at him, and hesitates on her next move. But she decides to climb in Larsen's car. \nThe big black car is coming toward them. LARSEN Get in! \nLARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly climbs into the back of the car and closes the door. \nA STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe man reaches Larsen's car just as it drives away. The man remains on the sidewalk with a mean look on his face. The black limousine stops near him and he climbs inside. \nLARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly looks through the rear windshield at the car following them. Larsen has a hard time driving with his hand tied on the steering wheel. \nLARSEN Please, give me the keys. \nBilly nods her head \u00abNo\u00bb. Larsen gives her the notepad. \nLARSEN Write. Where is the diskette ? \nBilly looks at the following car. \nLARSEN We cannot escape in this car. Write. Write. \nBilly starts writing. Then she shows the note pad to Larsen, who reads it. \nLARSEN Studio. Where in the studio ? Billy makes a \u00abNo\u00bb with her finger. \nA STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nLarsen's car makes a left turn into another street. \nTHE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThrough the windshield, we see Larsen's car turning into the adjacent street. Wartschuk speaks in his talkie. \nWARTSCHUK Delta three. \nBILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nOne of the fake policeman picks up his talkie from the table \nWARTSCHUK (voice over from the talkie) Delta three. \nThe policeman answers \u00abDa\u00bb, then listen to Wartschuk speaking in Russian. He says \u00abDa\u00bb again and a few more words. Karen and Andy look at him, with a worried look on their face. Wartschuk answers him. Apparently, Andy understood a few words, because he says : \nANDY What ? \nThe policeman drops the talkie on the table and talks to his colleague. \nANDY What ? \nThe other policeman walks near Andy and Karen, raising his gun. \nANDY This is all a big misunderstanding and... Excuse me, but this is... \nThe first policeman takes Andy's hands and cuffs them behind his back. \nANDY You don't have to arrest us. Why is he arresting me ? This is ridiculous. I'm an American citizen. Do you understand what I'm saying ? Now, I'm a director. \nKaren turns her head and looks at the dead Lyosha. \nANDY You know, I'm directing a movie here in Moscow. I'm bringing a lot of money in this place. \nThe policemen don't seem to take any notice of what Andy is saying. One is still cuffing his hands while the other one is holding his gun. \nANDY And my father, okay, he knows a lot of big people, and... Listen. \nThe policeman raises Andy to his feet and moves him away from Karen. \nANDY You want money ? Is that what you want ? \nKAREN Hel... \nANDY Hello ? We need help ! \nThe man starts talking rapidly in Russian. \nANDY I'm a director, and I'm making a movie here. This is not a movie. \nThe man hasn't stopped talking. Actually, he and Andy have been talking together. Now he yells something in Russian. Andy turns toward Karen. \nANDY Put the gun away. You look like a hit man. He thinks we're gonna kill him ! \nAndy took the gun from Karen and now he is waving it at the man. \nKAREN We're not gonna kill you ! \nANDY This is not even ours ! \nKAREN The policemen wanted to kill us ! \nThe man turns around and runs out of the apartment, yelling in Russian. \nKAREN We gotta get out of here. \nANDY Well, I think we should call the cops. \nKAREN Are you crazy ? \nANDY Well, we can explain this. \nKAREN Explain ? You are crazy. Come on. Here. \nShe has a gun in her hand and she gives him another gun. She runs out of the apartment. Andy takes the handcuffs from the table. \nANDY I'll take these too. \nHe follows Karen out of the apartment. \nCINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nClose shot on the entrance of the studio, where a plate says something in Russian and underneath : \u00abCentral Film Studio\u00bb. \nLarsen's car enters the studio. It stops near the building. \nWe see Billy and Larsen through the windshield. Larsen shows his handcuff to Billy. \nLARSEN And now ? Billy tries to get out of the car, but she can't open the back door. \nLARSEN Child locks. \nBilly gets the key out of her pocket and gives it to Larsen, who unlocks the handcuff. \nHe gets out of the car and closes the door. He goes around the car to open Billy's door. As he is doing it, he sees car headlights coming his way. \nLARSEN Don't look now, but our friends are still here. \nThey both runs toward the building. He opens a big metal door and they enter the building. \nCINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThis is the unused set, where Billy went, at the beginning of the story, when she found herself locked in. It has metal doors opening directly on the parking lot. \nBilly pulls the big bolt that locks the door from the inside. Then Larsen puts a padlock on the bolt. \nLARSEN I will block the other entrances. \nThey both walk away. \nMOSCOW - A STREET NEAR RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren's car is driving full speed toward The Red Square. When she takes a turn, the tires are screeching on the macadam and the car zigzags a little. \nKAREN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT. \nWartschuk enters silently on the set. \nLarsen gets the diskette out of its hiding place. Billy picks it up. Behind her, Wartschuk has got his gun out. Billy stands up with the diskette in her hand. She smiles. Wartschuk grabs her from the back. She throws the diskette. Larsen catches it. \nLARSEN You helped us a lot, Billy. Thank you. \nLarsen puts discreetly the diskette in Wartschuk's pocket. WARTSCHUK The Reaper wants to meet the woman who has kept him up all night and witnessed a live snuff. \nHe gives his gun to Larsen. \nWARTSCHUK He wants you to do it. \nLARSEN You know why we call him The Reaper ? You see his face, you die. \nBilly spits in Larsen's face. Then she yells silently, because Wartschuk is squeezing her a little tighter. Larsen wipes the spit from his face. Larsen raises his gun, holding it by the barrel. Billy looks very frightened, because she knows that Larsen is going to knock her out. But the butt of the gun lands violently... on Wartschuk's head, who screams and falls heavily on the floor. Billy looks from Larsen to the falling man, not understanding clearly what happened. \nCINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR \nAndy is hiding behind a trash can. He looks up at the watcher on the balcony. He finally comes out of his hiding place, but bumps into a beer can lying on the ground. The watcher says something in Russian and points his flashlight toward Andy. \nANDY Nice night, isn't it ? \nKaren is slowly going around the pile of empty film boxes on which Billy fell earlier. \nANDY I'm just taking a piss. Right, you know, just... The watcher walks slowly down the ladder. Karen reaches the ladder, climbs on something we don't see, and catches the watcher's foot through the steps of the ladder. The man falls and rolls all the way down the ladder. He is unconscious and Andy ties his wrist to the ladder with the handcuff. Karen joins him. Andy seems very happy about the successful operation. \nThe Reaper's black limousine is entering the parking lot. \nKaren, who has started to go up the steps of the ladder, looks at the limousine. \nKAREN Who the hell is that ? \nANDY Well, whoever it is, they're coming here. \nThey reach the balcony and enter the building. \nThe Reaper's car is driving toward the building, with all the men, equipped with machine guns, watching his arrival. CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren and Andy are running along the long corridor. Andy is still trying to work out the safety of his gun. \nANDY I can't work the safety. \nKAREN Andy, come on. \nANDY Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. \nHe falls down, dropping all the bullets on the floor. \nKAREN Hurry ! \nAndy picks up his bullets, stands up and runs after Karen. \nCINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe Reaper's car is still surrounded by all the guards in arms. \nWe see only the shadow of The Reaper inside his car. \nTHE REAPER Where is she, Larsen ? \nWe guess he is talking into a walkie-talkie. \nCINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThis is the unused film set, with large metal doors opening on the parking lot Karen enters the gallery above the room, followed by Andy. She bends down, and makes him bend down. \nTHE REAPER (voice over from the talkie) Larsen, are you reading me ? \nKAREN (whispering) Somebody's coming. \nANDY (whispering) I'm waiting. \nDown below, on the set itself, Billy is walking, with Larsen behind her, pointing a gun in her back. \n", "test1_input": "ANDY (yelling) A day ? \nTHE RUSSIAN ASSISTANT Yeah. \nAndy stands up and slaps his thighs, looking very nervous. \nANDY Okay, well, let's just do the close-up of the corpse now, and that'll wrap it for today. \nThe Russian assistant says a few words in Russian. Andy makes a sign to the camera operator for him to come closer to him. The operator joins Andy. \nANDY All right. Okay. So, what I want to do is zoom in, do a slow zoom into the puddle of blood... On another part of the set, behind the dining room, Billy kneels down in front of a big ancient-looking wooden trunk. \nOn the lid of the trunk is written, in white large capital letters : \u00abKEEP OUT ! BILLY'S BOX\u00bb. Billy opens the trunk. Inside, on the inside part of the lid, various props, and in the trunk itself, a big square plastic bottle and, in a plastic box, plenty of smaller bottles. \nBehind   Billy, who is still kneeling in front of the trunk, we see Lyosha   walking around. He looks at Billy, who feels she is being looked   at. She turns around and looks at Lyosha. Natasha walks toward   Billy. \nNATASHA Billy. \nNatasha kneels down to be at Billy's level. \nNATASHA Madame Olga wants some sugar in her blood again. Billy laughs. \nBILLY (in sign language) Thank you. \nBilly stands up and starts pulling the big heavy square plastic bottle out of the trunk. Lyosha comes to help Billy pull the bottle out of the trunk. They both slowly put the bottle down on the floor. Billy looks up at Lyosha, who is smiling to her. Then he walks away. Billy, kneeling on the floor, opens the bottle. Karen walks in from behind the trunk. She leans on the open lid of the trunk. \nKAREN So, he's kind of cute. \nBilly is pouring a bag of sugar in the bottle. \nKAREN Three months in Moscow, cold winter nights... \nBilly smiles. \nKAREN Just a thought. \nBilly makes several language signs. \nKAREN Billy, that's what Mom would say. \nBilly looks at her sister. \nAnother part of the set, near the entrance of the set. The building janitor, wearing a more or less official cap, just walked in. Karen sees the janitor and waves at him. Billy looks in the janitor's direction. KAREN Hi. \nBilly waves at the janitor, who waves back at the girls. Then he yells something in Russian. Billy and Karen look at each other. They seem to understand what he says. Billy shows two finger to him. The janitor says something in Russian and walks away. \nThe dining-room set. The young Russian actress is sitting on the floor among the debris she has created and she is putting lipstick on her lips, looking at her face in a small pocket mirror. Billy walks in with a small plastic case in her hands. She sits on the floor next to the actress and puts the box down beside her. She takes the lipstick and the mirror away from the actress' hands, and puts them down on the floor. Then she gives her a little piece of white cotton to wipe the lipstick out of her lips. The actress takes it and starts wiping her lips. Then Billy takes some make-up to put it on the actress' face. A male hand puts a light meter close to the actress' face. \nA strong light starts playing on Billy's face, and we hear a Russian voice who seems to come from a loudspeaker. \nThe upper part of the film set. Three big spotlights on a rack. An electrician is playing with one of them. \nBilly puts her hand above her eyes to try to locate who is sending that strong light on her face. \nThe electrician says a few words in Russian. \nThe actress looks up to see who is talking. \nCloser shot on the electrician sitting on the spotlight rack. He is Arkadi, the man who was sitting next to the actor playing the murderer, and who offered him a light for his cigarette. He speaks in Russian with a queer smile on his face. \nNatasha squats down near Billy and the actress, to speak to Billy. \nNATASHA He says use more white like a real dead body. \nBilly covers her eyes and looks up at the spotlight rack. \nArkadi smiles and winks to Billy. \nBilly closes her plastic case. \nThe actress eats a piece of cake. She lies down on the floor. \nANDY (voice over) Okay, Boris, get everyone ready. \n", "test1_true": "A VOICE OVER WITH A RUSSIAN ACCENT Out of frame, Billy. Billy stands up and walks away. \nThe camera, and the group of people around it. Andy is sitting on his director's chair, and Karen is kneeling on the other side of the camera, writing on a clipboard. A clapperboard girl walks in front of the camera, says a few words in Russian, claps her clapperboard and walks away. We hear a loud noise, and most of the spotlights are suddenly switched off. Andy looks up at the spotlight racks. \nANDY What... what is going on now ? \nBilly, standing in the half-dark set with her plastic case in front of her, looks up around her as more spotlights are switched off with loud noises. \nAlex, who must be the assistant producer, walks toward Andy, tapping his wristwatch. \nALEX Andy. Sorry, it's six o'clock. \nANDY One shot, one more shot ! \nALEX We have no time. \nBilly opens her arms in a gesture of despair. \nAll the people around Andy start leaving the set. \nANDY One shot ! I can't believe this. \nCINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR EVENING \nNight is coming. The sky is grey. In the background, a group of people is coming out of a building. \nAndy and Billy are crossing the parking lot. Cars are driving around them : the film crew members are leaving the studio. Andy waves his hand at one of them. \nAndy and Billy come to a white car parked near a red car. Karen is walking on the other side of the white car. She opens the driver's door. Billy is standing near the red car, and looking for something in her purse. She can't find it and looks disappointed. She taps on the roof of her car. \nKaren was ready to get inside her car, but, when she hears Billy's tapping, she looks up. Billy explains something in sign language. Andy doesn't understand and turns towards Karen \nKAREN She needs to go get Strohbecker's face. \nAndy claps his hands. ANDY Ohh ! Right ! His dummy falls off the balcony on Monday. \nKAREN We'll wait for you here. \nBilly starts walking away. Andy turns toward Karen. \nANDY Karen, she's got her own car. \nBilly explains something in sign language. \nKAREN Okay. Okay. Don't forget tonight. \nShe opens the door of her car. Andy turns around to face Billy. \nANDY Yeah, yeah, yeah! Fiesta ! I'm making my famous chili con Clarke. Near Andy's car, Alex, the assistant producer we just saw on the set, is opening the door of his car. \nANDY Alex !... what do you say ? You coming ? \nAlex has already opened the door of his car. \nALEX Sorry. I have tickets for the Bolshoi Ballet tonight. \nAndy sneers. \nANDY Well, try and stay awake. \nAndy opens the door, gets inside the car and closes the door. \nCINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR EVENING \nClose up shot on a green hideous mask held with both hands by Billy. \nAround Biily, all the props used for the film she is working on, or other films. Billy puts the green mask down. She looks around for something. She throws away various masks she doesn't need. Billy is kneeling near a large box used as a table. On the box something is written in large capital Russian letters. Around Billy, a lot of props are scattered around. Apparently, Billy can't find what she is looking for, and sits back on her heels in despair. She hears a loud noise. She sits up when she hears the noise. She tries to figure out what that noise means. She stands up and runs toward a window. \nThe sky is darker. The night is coming soon. Billy looks through the window. On the parking lot, seen trough the bars of the window, the janitor is crossing the yard with his dog. \nBilly opens the window and turns around, looking for something to hit the metal bars of the window. She takes a spear from a suit of armor. Then she bangs on the bars of the window with the long handle of the spear. \nOn the parking lot, seen through the bars of the window, the janitor keeps on walking around with his dog, apparently not hearing the noise made by Billy. Then he closes the main door of the studio parking lot. \n", "test1_id": 135, "test2_input": "KAREN Thank God. She's there. Are you all right ? \nANDY Ask her about the mask. \nKaren shushes Andy with her hand. \nKAREN You want to tap something through ? CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly is holding the telephone next to her ear. She taps on the microphone with her finger. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren has the telephone handset squeezed between her head and her shoulder. \nKAREN Wait. Wait. Wait. \nAndy turns around because he just heard a hissing noise in the kitchen. He runs toward the stove. \nANDY Oh, man ! \nKAREN (voice over) A...O... \nANDY Oh, man ! \nIn the kitchen, Andy tries to save his cooking. \nKAREN ...L ? \nAndy puts his frying pan down into a large white plastic can full of water, where it starts hissing. \nANDY Man ! Oh, man ! \nKAREN Was it L ? The second letter, was it L ? Karen shushes Andy with her hand. \nANDY Shit ! \nAndy is getting his frying pan out of the plastic can. \nKAREN A-L-L ? \nWhile Karen is trying to understand her sister's message, Andy is banging the frying pan on the side of the can, to get rid of everything that was inside it. \nKAREN O...kay ! \nShe smiles. \nIn the kitchen, Andy looks at his empty frying pan. ANDY We're eating out tonight. \nKAREN Okay. So are you coming over now ? \nCINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly keeps on tapping on the microphone. \nKAREN (voice over on the telephone) Do you have the mask ? \nBilly taps again. \nKAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKAREN Well, don't worry. Just get over here. \nANDY You hungry ? \nKAREN Bye. \nAndy throws the frying pan in the can of water, where it hisses again. Karen looks at Andy, puts the telephone down and makes a face. \nCINEMA STUDIO - STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly is running downstairs. \nCINEMA STUDIO - A FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "With Billy in the background, we see a camera with an operator behind it. \nOn a bed, two actors are having sex. The female, a blonde woman, is naked, the male has his pants down to his ankles and is wearing a T-shirt and a white mask. \nBilly looks slightly embarrassed by what she sees. \nClose shot on the face of the camera operator, looking into the viewfinder of his camera. He is Lyosha, the young man who was courting Billy. \nThe blonde naked woman is moaning. She is a slightly plump woman with hair too blonde to be true. She could be in her forties. Billy, still looking slightly embarrassed, is also smiling. \nThe woman is faking a very strong orgasm. \nLYOSHA (voice over) Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! \nThe woman instantly stops faking her orgasm and gets up from the bed. Lyosha talks in Russian to the woman, who is still lying on the bed. Her \u00ablover\u00bb, lying on the woman, is answering Lyosha in Russian. \nLyosha looks back into his viewfinder. \nWe hear the woman, moaning again. Billy walks around the set. \nClose shot on the face of the \u00ablover\u00bb. He is wearing the mask Billy has been looking for. In the background behind the man, we see Billy, looking from behind an open window in the scenery. \nLyosha looks up from his viewfinder, then back again into it. \nThe woman's \u00ablover\u00bb slaps her gently on the face, but keeps on having sex with her. The man slaps her again but much harder this time. She screams. \nBilly looks surprised by what she sees. \nThe man holds the woman down on the bed with both hands. He slaps her very hard several times and then hits her with his fist. \nBilly closes her eyes, disgusted by what she sees. We hear the woman being hit and screaming. \nThe woman seems very surprised by what is happening to her. The man keeps on hitting her. She tries to cover her face from the blows she is getting repeatedly. Lyosha smiles, looking very happy with what is happening on the set. \nThe woman tries to get the man away from her. She grabs his mask and throws it away. Underneath the mask, the man has another black very close-fitting fabric mask hiding his face, which could be a black stocking. He grabs both her hands with one of his hands, and holds them above her head. Then he takes a black strong ribbon from under the bed and ties her hands with it. The woman is now very frightened and tries to get free. The man slaps her very hard. \nClose shot on a pillow being lifted by the hand of the man. Under the pillow, there is a long very sharp knife. \nBilly can't believe what she sees. \nThe man takes the knife and slowly lifts the knife above his head. \nBilly looks more and more frightened. She has tears in her eyes. She is crying silently with her fist in her mouth. The man start stabbing the woman. Her blood is splashing on the wall and the man's T-shirt. The woman is covered with her own blood. \nBilly starts walking away from the window and across the set. \nThe woman doesn't seem to move anymore, but the man is still stabbing her. \nBilly walks backward across the set and she bumps into a hatstand which falls down. Everything that was in the open purse hanging on the hatstand - hairbrush, keys, lighter, make-up things, etc. - falls on the floor. A plastic diskette-case skids on the floor and slips under a big wooden wardrobe. \nLyosha, alerted by the noise, stands up from his camera. \nBilly is kneeling on the floor near the fallen hatstand. \nLyosha goes back to his camera. \nBilly, kneeling on the floor, puts everything back into the purse. Then she stands up, puts the hatstand back on its legs and walks away from it. She hides behind the large wooden wardrobe. Lyosha walks slowly toward the place where Billy is hiding. Billy walks away and Lyosha stops near the hatstand. \nCINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe long dark corridor. In the foreground on the left, the staircase, the only part of the set where there is light (apparently coming from the windows and the street lights). Billy is running upstairs. She enters the corridor, where she starts running, just when Lyosha appears in the staircase, running after Billy. When he reaches the landing, Lyosha switches on the lights in the corridor. Just before Lyosha enters the corridor, in the background, we see Billy hiding in a nook, a small partition, in the corridor. \nLyosha looks for her. Billy seems suddenly interested by something up on the wall across from her. It is a sign for an emergency exit. Billy looks in the direction the sign is pointing at. It is the emergency exit. \nLyosha is coming toward Billy's hiding. He stops to listen for a meaningful noise. He opens a door to look into a room. Billy peeks from behind her hiding nook. She runs toward the emergency exit, which is located toward the end of the long corridor. \nThe open door, and just behind it, Lyosha looking into the room. He switches the light off, just as Billy reaches the emergency exit. He walks out of the room, and closes slowly the door behind him. He looks at the far end of the corridor. \nLYOSHA Hey ! \nHe walks a couple of steps and stops. He turns around and says a few words in Russian. Billy is hiding behind a big red vending machine at the far end of the corridor. Lyosha looks around him and Billy looks at the emergency exit. \nClose shot on the handle of the emergency door. Then the camera pans on the left and stops on the red emergency box, with the door key inside. Near the key, is posted a long notice in Russian. \n", "test2_id": 136, "test3_input": "Through the half-open door, Larsen shows The Reaper the diskette he has found on the set. \nThe Reaper smiles. The big metal door closes as Larsen goes back inside. \nAll the men go back inside their cars. The engines start. And the cars start driving out, The Reaper's car being the first one to go. Billy is still lying motionless on the ground, her blood flowing slowly on the tarmac. \nCINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT \nKaren is in Andy's arms, crying. \nCINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe last cars are leaving the parking lot. \nCINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAndy, with Karen crying on his laps, looks at Larsen coming back in and closing the door. \nLARSEN Now please, let me explain. Please ? \nKAREN (yelling) Explain ? \nShe rushes out of Andy's arms and bumps violently into Larsen. \nANDY Karen ! \nThey both fall on the floor, and Larsen's gun flies away from his hand. Karen hits Larsen very hard with both her fists. Andy picks up the gun and points it at Larsen. Larsen pushes Karen away from him. Karen takes the legs of a statue and hits Larsen with it. Then she grabs Larsen by the ears and throws him on the metal door. She turns toward Andy. \nKAREN Kill him. \nKaren opens the door and walks out. CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nBilly, still lying on the ground, opens one eye and smiles. \nKaren runs out of the building and rushes toward her sister, who stands up when she sees her. Karen stops and looks at her. Karen sits up and raises her sweatshirt. \nUnderneath, she is equipped with the special effect system she uses to pretend people are being shot. Little bags, full of fake blood, explode one by one, tearing the piece of clothing in front of them, and pouring the blood through the fabric. For the spectator, it does looks like bullet going through a body and blood spurting out. \nKaren rushes to Billy and hugs her. \nKAREN You genius ! \nCINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT Larsen is still kneeling on the floor. Andy is pointing the gun at him, trying to look mean, which is a bit hard for him. \nANDY You thought we were tourists, huh ? Guess again, pal. \nLarsen is slowly getting up. \nANDY Don't move. Don't move! I'm talking to you ! \nHe shoots the gun to the ceiling. \nANDY I'm warning you. Don't move or I'm gonna shoot you ! Okay ! \nHe shoots at Larsen, who doesn't react and walks closer to him. He shoots twice more, walking backward. He bumps into a prop and falls down on his back... next to Wartschuk, all tied up and with a large piece of tape across his mouth. Wartschuk moans, Andy screams and gets quickly up. He rushes out of the building while Larsen is trying to get over what just happened to him \nCINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nAndy rushes out of the building and sees Karen cleaning Billy's face. \nANDY Billy ! Billy ! Billy ! \nKAREN She's okay. She's fine. \nANDY She's fine ? She's okay ? Billy mouth the words \u00abI'm fine\u00bb and shows him the special effect device on her stomach. Larsen comes behind her and takes her by the shoulder, saying a few words in Russian. Billy says something in sign language to Karen. \nKAREN A cop ? \nANDY A cop ? \nKAREN Oh, my God, I'm sorry. \nANDY Sorry. \n", "test3_true": "Karen pats Larsen's shoulder. KAREN Next time, hit back. \nLarsen throws a remote control into Andy's hands. \nANDY Oh !... this is the remote. I get it. \nThey all laugh. Larsen pats Andy's shoulder. \nLARSEN Big cowboy. \nBilly starts talking in sign language to Larsen. He turns toward Karen. \nLARSEN What ? \nKAREN That was an invitation to dinner sometime. \nLARSEN How you say ?... It would be a pleasure. \nBilly mouthes the word \u00abPleasure\u00bb and then makes the sign for it, which is rubbing you stomach. Larsen makes the same sign. Then he stops and seems to think about something. \nLARSEN I still don't understand. \nKAREN What ? \nLARSEN I don't understand why The Reaper didn't take the diskette off me. KAREN Who ? \nThe sound of a shot, and a blood bag explodes under Billy's sweater. Karen screams. Since she was just in front of Billy, her face is covered with fake blood. Andy looks at them, the remote control in his hand. \nANDY Whoops !... Shit. I'm sorry. \nThey all look at him. Larsen smiles. \nLARSEN Big cowboy. \nA little later. \nAndy drives his car near the entrance of the building. Billy walks toward the car, looking at Wartschuk, his mouth still gagged, being forced by Larsen to go inside his car. He moans incomprehensible words, and seems not to want to get inside the car. \nAndy waves to Larsen. \nANDY Ciao !... \nAndy opens the back door of his own car to let Billy inside. But she doesn't climb in, still surprised by Wartschuk's attitude. \nFinally, Larsen succeeds in putting his prisoner in the back of his car, where another prisoner, also gagged, is already waiting (certainly the man that Andy had handcuffed earlier on the emergency ladder). \nBefore climbing into the driver's seat, Larsen waves to Billy. \nLARSEN Billy, tomorrow ! \nHe makes the \u00abpleasure\u00bb sign. Billy waves back to him. \nLARSEN Tomorrow ! \nBilly looks at Wartschuk inside the car. She seems worried. \nANDY What's the matter ? \nBilly makes several signs. Andy doesn't understand, but he looks at Larsen. Larsen smiles back to him. \nLARSEN Big cowboy. \nKaren is already seated in the car, and doesn't understand the reason for the delay. \nKAREN Guys, could we get out of here, please ? \nClose shot on Wartschuk's face, who is trying to tell them something. \nAndy eventually understand what Billy is trying to tell him. It is the word he learned earlier in the restaurant. \nANDY The expression ? \nBilly nods \u00abYes\u00bb. Larsen smiles to her and starts his car. Billy slams violently on the roof of Andy's car. She seems frightened by something. She yells silently. \n", "test3_id": 137}

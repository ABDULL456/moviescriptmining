{"train": "\"THE MUMMY\" \nby \nStephen Sommers \nThe UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on the African continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT rises up. WE PUSH IN on it, towards a CITY along the Nile, it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP PUSHING IN until the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not ancient. \nSUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS. \nTHEBES - 2,134 B.C \nAccompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent: \nNARRATOR Thebes. City of the Living. Crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First. \nThe CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn CHARIOT comes barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; an aristocratic, virile old man. The chariot WIPES FRAME. \nINT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK \nGlaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, muscular MAN with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP. \nNARRATOR Home of Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris, Keeper of the Dead. \nA gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN. \nNARRATOR Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's Mistress. No other man was allowed to touch her. \nShe makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA comes to a stop on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's really a strange looking TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald MEN stand nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains. \nAnck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body, smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with lust: \nNARRATOR But for our love, we were willing to risk life itself. \nAnd we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush over and close the doors. But just as they do, the doors suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, -- SUBTITLED. \nPHARAOH What are you doing here? \nThe Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival was unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws them back. \nAnck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh sees the smeared body paint. Points his finger. \nPHARAOH WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?! \nFrom behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. Pharaoh spins around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked. \nPHARAOH Imhotep?... My priest. \nBehind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into his back. \nPharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous bald Priests SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the curtains, they see the SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the doors are RAMMED from the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers share desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony. \nPRIESTS Pharaoh's bodyguards! \nImhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony. \nANCK-SU-NAMUN You must go. Save yourself. Only you can resurrect me. \nImhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN. \nMEN with BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over their bodies stride in, armed to the teeth. These are the MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony just as the Mumia rip through the curtains. \nAnck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses -- \nANCK-SU-NAMUN My body is no longer his temple! \nShe PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. Out on the balcony, Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream... \nNARRATOR/IMHOTEP For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's body was to be cursed. And it was I, the High Priest, whose duty it was to curse it. \nEXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT \nImhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck- su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS. \nIMHOTEP Her body was mummified, her vital organs removed and placed in sacred canopic jars. \nImhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING. \nIMHOTEP The Book of The Living contained sacred incantations that would send the evil dead on a journey into the dark underworld. \nStrange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising. \nThen one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the ground. \nImhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus. \nThe Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand. Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears at the Nubians. Killing them. \nThe blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle BOX. \nIMHOTEP They would never allow me to be released. For I would arise a walking disease, a plague upon mankind, an unholy flesh-eater, with the strength of ages, power over the sands, and the glory of invincibility. \nImhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean. \nIMHOTEP And if I could raise my beloved Anck- su-namun from her place in hell, together, we would be an unstoppable infection upon this world. The Apocalypse. The End. \nImhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM: \nTHE MUMMY \nThe heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave. \nLooking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, the jackal-headed god of death. It stares at us. Then begins to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half- buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert. \nEXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY \nImhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG HORSEMAN. \nRacing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren. Armed to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS: \nTHE SAHARA - 1925 \nA mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL. \nHe looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at him. \nO'CONNELL I knew this was gonna be a lousy day. \nA doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of the wall. This is BENI. \nBENI Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender? \nO'CONNELL Shut-up and gimme your bandolier. \nBeni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell. \nBENI Then let's run away. Right now. While we can still make it. \nO'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier. \nO'CONNELL Now gimme your revolver, you'll never use it anyway. \nBeni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell. \nBENI Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody ever does that anymore. \nO'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver \nO'CONNELL Now go find me a big stick. \nBENI In the desert? What for? \nO'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him. \nO'CONNELL So I can tie it to your back, you appear to be without a spine. \nThe horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins. \nO'CONNELL How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways? \nBENI I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them? \nO'CONNELL Altar boys? \nBENI Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody? \nBeni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground. \nO'Connell gives him a nasty look. \nO'CONNELL No, but I'm considering it. \nThey get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp \nBENI What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping! \nO'CONNELL None of the above, thank you. \nBENI Then what the hell are you doing here!? \nThey both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening. \nO'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile. \nO'CONNELL I was just looking for a good time. \nWE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN: \nCAIRO \nINT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY \nDeep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare. \nThis is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with her. \nEvelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with the letter \"O\". Then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads the title. \nEVELYN Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up here? \nCarefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles begin with the letter \"T\". Then she looks down. It's a long way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer. \nAnd that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts stiltwalking down the aisle. \nEVELYN OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH! \nThe ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY. \nAnd that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES into the next bookshelf. \nEvelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other eye and stares at the huge mess. \nEVELYN Oops. \nThe Egyptian CURATOR storms in. \nCURATOR Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! Give me frogs, flies, locusts, anything but this! Compared to you, the other plagues were a joy! \nEvelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books. \nEVELYN I'm sorry, it was an accident. \nCURATOR When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you? \nEvelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself. \nEVELYN You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library. \nCURATOR Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess! \nThe Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming. \nAnd then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT. \nEVELYN Hello? \nQuiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery. \nEVELYN Abdul? Mohammed? Bob? \nEvelyn walks through the stacks and enters -- \nINT. THE RAMESSEUM \nFilled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery. \nThe NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch. \nLooks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans forward with the torch, and peers inside. \n-- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her! \nEvelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half drunk. \nEVELYN You...! YOU...! \nJONATHAN Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original. \nMeet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth. \nEVELYN Have you no respect for the dead? \nJONATHAN Right now, I only wish to join them. \nHe grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest. \nEVELYN Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours. \nJONATHAN My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note. \nHe BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb. \nEVELYN High note? Ha! For five years you've been scrounging around Egypt, and what have you to show for it? Nothing. \nEVELYN I'm your sister. \nJONATHAN That just makes you more gullible. \nEVELYN You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?! \nJONATHAN Picked his pocket, actually. \nEXT. VISITOR'S PEN - DAY \nThe Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen. \nEVELYN And what is he in prison for? \nWARDEN I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself. \nEVELYN And what did he say? \nWARDEN He said... he was just looking for a good time. \nThe interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars. \nFrom the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance. \nEVELYN But he's just a filthy criminal? \nJONATHAN (cringing) Way to go, Evy. \nO'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan. \nO'CONNELL So who's the broad? \nEVELYN Broad?! \nJONATHAN She's my sister, actually. \nO'CONNELL Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss. \nEvelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door. \nWARDEN I'll be back in a moment. \nO'CONNELL (sarcastic) I tremble with anticipation. \nA Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer. \nEVELYN We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it. \nO'CONNELL No. \nEVELYN No? \nO'CONNELL No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra. \nEvelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy. \nEVELYN How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra? \nO'CONNELL Because that's where I found it. I was there. \nEvelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious \nJONATHAN How do we know that's not a load of pig swallow? \nO'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition. \nO'CONNELL Hey,... don't I know you? \nJONATHAN Um, well, you see... \nO'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again. \nHe shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look. \nEvelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell. \nEVELYN You were actually at Hamunaptra? \nO'CONNELL I just decked your brother \nEVELYN Yes, well... (shrugs) I know my brother. \nO'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl. \nO'CONNELL Yeah, I was there. \nEVELYN You swear? \nThe prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger. \nThe GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear. \nEVELYN He knows the location to Hamunaptra. \nThe warden spins around and faces her. \nWARDEN You lie. \nEVELYN I would never! \nAt the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn. \nWARDEN Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly? \nEVELYN Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent. \nWARDEN Fifty percent. \nEVELYN Twenty. \nWARDEN Forty. \nEvelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl. \nO'CONNELL Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- \nEVELYN Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more. \nThe warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic. A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING. \nAll of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him. \nCURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nCANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face. \nCURATOR She must die. \nStanding in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA: blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. One of the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs. \nHOOK She is like all the others. She will die in the desert. \nCURATOR No! She has seen too much. She knows too much. \nThe Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes. \nCURATOR Not only does she have a map, but she has the key. \nSpooks the hell out of the Mumia guys. \nHOOK The key!? She has the lost key!? \nCURATOR Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all. \nHOOK Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her. \nCURATOR And burn the map and retrieve the key. \nHOOK It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well. \nCURATOR Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra? \nEXT. GIZA PORT - DAY \nSMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI. \nBENI It is three days down the Nile, then two days by camel, sahibs. \nWE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS. \nDANIELS For all the money we're paying you, something better god-damned well be under that sand. \nWE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back. \nHENDERSON \"Hamunaptra,\" Daniels, that's all ya gotta keep sayin, to yourself, \"Hamunaptra.\" \nNow we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures. \nEVELYN Do you really think he'll show up? \nJONATHAN Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word. \nEVELYN Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit. \nO'CONNELL (O.S.) Anyone I know? \nEvelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river. \nThe gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her. \nO'CONNELL Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya. \nEVELYN The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners. \nO'CONNELL Still angry that I kissed ya, huh? \nEVELYN If you call that a kiss. \nO'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite. \nEVELYN Did I miss something? Are we going into battle? \nO'CONNELL The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died. \nThis takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts dismantling and cleaning the guns. \nO'CONNELL There's something out there, you know, something under that sand. \nEVELYN Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there? \nO'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes. \nO'CONNELL Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, \"the doorway to hell.\" \nEVELYN Ahmar is Ossirion. \"Passageway to the underworld\", actually. \nShe gives him a know-it-all grin. \nEVELYN I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit. \nO'CONNELL And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right? \nEvelyn is surprised by his knowledge. \nEVELYN You know your history. \nO'CONNELL I know my treasure. \nEvelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says: \nEVELYN By the way,... why did you kiss me? \nO'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders. \nO'CONNELL I was about to be hanged, seemed like a good idea at the time. \nEvelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off. \nO'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed. \nO'CONNELL What?... Wha'd I say? \nThen he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni. \nBENI My very good friend! What a surprise. \nO'CONNELL Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you. \nO'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin. \nBENI You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell. \nO'CONNELL So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot? \nBENI Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way. \nO'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck. \nBENI You never believed in Hamunaptra, O'Connell. Why are you going back? The devil himself lives out there. \nThey look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck. \nO'CONNELL The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble. \nBENI You always did have more balls than brains. \nO'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni. \nO'CONNELL Let's make us even, shall we? \nBENI Even? \nO'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge. \nHe picks her up and throws her over the side. \nO'CONNELL The occasion calls for it. \nEvelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after her. \nEXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT \nJonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head. \nJONATHAN Americans. \nHook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH. \nJonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles. \nJONATHAN I say! Good show! \nThen he points his thumb at himself \nJONATHAN And did I panic? \nHe lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back. \nJONATHAN I think not. \nAnd that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other. \nNILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT \nO'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices. \nEverybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans. \nBENI Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses! \nO'CONNELL Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river! \nBeni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking... \nBEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY \nO'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them the reins of four ugly old camels. \nJONATHAN I can't believe the price of these fleabags. \nO'CONNELL We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister. \nJONATHAN Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it? \nO'CONNELL Awfully. \nAnd that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress. \nO'CONNELL Then again... \nSAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY \nO'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara. \nJONATHAN Never did like camels. Filthy buggers. They smell, they bite, they spit. Disgusting. \nThe warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him. \nO'CONNELL Yeah, disgusting. \nEvelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel. \nEVELYN Well I think they're cute. \nWE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it. \nFRYING PAN - NIGHT \nThe MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking across the vast wasteland. \nJonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her, then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he looks up at a distant ridge -- \n-- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing them. \nEXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY \nThe dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune. \nJONATHAN And you snore! \nWARDEN I do not snore! \nBeni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell. Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK! \nBut on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES. \nEvelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard. \nO'CONNELL Evelyn! Slow down! \nEvelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate. \nO'CONNELL SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S A REALLY BIG -- \nINT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY \nEvelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes. \nO'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel. \nO'CONNELL Never mind. \nThe Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin. \nO'CONNELL You boys owe me five hundred dollars. \nEXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY \nUnder the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps. \nDANIELS Where'd all these camels come from? \nBENI They belong to the dead. They will wait years for their masters to return before leaving. \nEXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY \nO'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins. \nO'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS. \nJONATHAN That thing gives me the creeps. \nO'CONNELL Be nice. That thing saved my life. \nEvelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice. \nEVELYN That \"thing\" gets me excited. \nO'CONNELL (sarcastic) The things that get you excited. \nEVELYN According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living. \nO'CONNELL What are those mirrors for? \nEVELYN Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see. \nO'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice. \nINT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY \nO'Connell waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness. \nEVELYN Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years. \nWARDEN Who cares? I don't see no treasure. \nO'CONNELL You're welcome to my share of the spider webs. \nJONATHAN And it stinks to high heaven in here. \nEvelyn just rolls her eyes. \nEVELYN Cretins. \nJonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden and realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops sniffing. \nEvelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall, then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. -- THE RAY OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's chamber. \nO'CONNELL That is a neat trick. \nEVELYN Oh my god, It's a preparation room. \nO'CONNELL Preparation for what? \nEVELYN For entering the afterlife. \nO'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him. \nJONATHAN Mummies, my good son, this is where they made the mummies. \nThe Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers. \nThe Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless. \nBeni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back away as well. \nINT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY \nThree Heroes are still digging into the ceiling \nO'CONNELL Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils? \nJONATHAN OWCH! That's really got to hurt. \nEVELYN It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this \nJONATHAN Still... \nO'CONNELL Yeah, that'd bring you back to life. \nEVELYN You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys. \nAnd that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT. \nO'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room. \nINT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER \nHaving heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS -- \nEGYPTOLOGIST FENI! \nThe three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers give one final pull and -- \n-- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM. \nDying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the ground... \nINT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY \nThe dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement. \nWe immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS. \nEVELYN Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus. \nO'CONNELL Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling? \nEVELYN They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty. \nINT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY \nThe warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing. \nCLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM. \nThe amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon. \nThen it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly burrows into the leather and vanishes inside. \nThe Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and COUGHING. \nAnd then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD. \nINT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY \nOur Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid. \nJONATHAN Well?... Who is it? \nEvelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned. \nEVELYN 'He that shall not be named.' \nO'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK \nO'CONNELL There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior? \nEVELYN Quarried granite with a cobalt lining. \nJONATHAN Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out. \nO'CONNELL No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing, \nEVELYN A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about. \nO'CONNELL Who was talking about what? \nBENI (struggling) Why do you like to fight so much? \nO'CONNELL 'Cause I look good doin, it. \nArdeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them. \nA scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone. \nEvelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, she hears something coming up behind her and spins around. \nA vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises his scimitar, about to strike. \nEvelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS him twenty feet back into some ruins. \nAt the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand dune. \nJonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them. \nJonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams. \nJONATHAN Let 'em have it, boys! \nJonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins. \nJONATHAN I say, bloody good show. \nAnd then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat. \nO'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES! \nHits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray points his scimitar at O'Connell's head. \nARDETH RAY LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE OR DIE! \nArdeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her and holds her close. \nO'CONNELL You alright? \nEvelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too. \nEVELYN Yes,... fine,... thank you. \nBeni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and Burns help Daniels to his feet. \nDANIELS See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand! \nHENDERSON For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there. \nO'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied. \nO'CONNELL These men are a desert people. They value water, not gold. \nEvelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried. \nEVELYN Where's Jonathan? \nEXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT \nJonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open. \nMouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk. \nO'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly -- \nEVELYN Unlike my brother, sir, I know when to say no. \nO'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away. \nO'CONNELL Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew. \nEVELYN I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this? \nO'CONNELL Something like that. \nEVELYN Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself \nO'CONNELL Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here? \nEvelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet. \nEVELYN I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am. \nO'CONNELL And what is that? \nEvelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins and proudly lifts her head high. \nEVELYN ...I am a librarian! \nThe Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around, sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her. \nEGYPTOLOGIST NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT! \nHe skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard, coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents. \nThe SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple. \nThe Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The Book Of The Dead, looking haunted. \nEGYPTOLOGIST What have we done? \nThe campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR \nINT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nO'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth, slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair \nJONATHAN Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers! \nO'CONNELL That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague! \nEVELYN This is not a plague. It's generational. Every so many years the locusts of Egypt have a population explosion and they all take flight. \nEvelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers his TORCH, -- the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS. \nO'CONNELL Okay,... and what about frogs? \nINT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT \nThe Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway. \nBurns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground, they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to his feet, squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness, \nBURNS Daniels! Henderson! \nINT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, -- HUNDREDS OF CHITTERING SCARAB BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS. \nEven O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul ass. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT \nBurns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out in front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything. \nThen ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps out. \nBURNS Daniels?... is that you? \nBurns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move. \nBURNS Henderson? \nBurns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEP'S PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at them, -- HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth. \nLABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nO'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS. \nO'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES. \nEvelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then they look across the way. Evelyn is gone. \nJONATHAN EVY!? \nSCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT \nEvelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards him. \nEVELYN Oh thank goodness, you're one of the Americans, aren't you? \nJust as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets. \nEvelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets. \nEvelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS. \nIMHOTEP Anck-su-namun? \nLABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nO'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto \nO'CONNELL Damn-it! Must be a trap door around here or somethin'. \nAnd then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson, Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs. \nEXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY \nLIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound, knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken. \nO'CONNELL Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!! \nEXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY \nEvelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard. \nO'CONNELL We got problems. \nAnd that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom. \nO'CONNELL He's here! I saw him! That thing is here! \nEVELYN The creature!? Are you sure!? \nO'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the HAIL and FIRE. \nO'CONNELL Pretty sure! \nThe HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet. \nO'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them. \nO'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs. \nINT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY \nO'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant who is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, -- HIS BODY IS SHRIVELED TO HALF IT'S SIZE. \nDrained of all organs and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are shocked. Then they hear a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep standing on the far side of the room. O'Connell draws his gun. \nImhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful new musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and REFORM. His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and CRIES OUT, in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell. \nThe 'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned. \nO'CONNELL We are in serious trouble. \nImhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn. \nO'CONNELL Back off, creep. \nImhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind. \nJonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're all stunned at the sight of Imhotep. \nO'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep in the face, -- HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEP'S SKULL AND GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it. \nImhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY. \nHe quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her. \nIMHOTEP You saved me from the undead. For this, I shall make you immortal. \nHe leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face. \nAnd that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING. \nImhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone. \nO'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed. \nHenderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified. \nHENDERSON The curse. The curse. \nINT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY \nO'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn across the Ramesseum. \nEVELYN There's only one person I know who can possibly give us some answers. \nThey round a corner and come upon the Curator, -- who is talking with Ardeth Ray. Everybody stops. \nEVERYBODY YOU! \nO'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns. Ardeth Ray just scowls. The Curator nods his head. \nCURATOR Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen. \nEVELYN What is he doing here? \nCURATOR Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us? \nEverybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38. \nEVELYN Who put you in charge? You can't just leave me behind like some old suitcase. I'm the one responsible for this mess and I intend to be the one to clean it up. \nO'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon. \nThen he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING. \nO'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels. \nO'CONNELL Keep an eye on her. If you leave her door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon, Jonathan. \nJonathan swallows hard and points to himself. \nJONATHAN Me? \nCAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT \nThe Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and his SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking him. A STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed face. \nHe reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO -- \nTHE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT \nBeni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves. \nO'CONNELL (O.S.) Well, well, well. \nBeni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door. \nO'CONNELL Lemme guess, spring cleaning? \nBeni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into a wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up the wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor. \nO'CONNELL Where's your new friend? \nBENI What friend? You're my only friend. \nO'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin. \nO'CONNELL Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you? \nBENI It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune. \nO'CONNELL Immune from what? \nBENI You shall see. \nO'CONNELL What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat. \nO'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin. \nBENI The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds. \nO'CONNELL What does he want the book for? \nBENI (shrugs) Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book... (looks at Jonathan) And your sister. \nO'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses. \nBeni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes. \nJONATHAN That looked rather painful. \nO'CONNELL (wincing) Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap. \nJONATHAN Yes, I know, I do that to people. \nAnd that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming from down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to the window and look out -- \nEXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT \nDown in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST. \nA partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters. \nThe flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running. \nEGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT \nO'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked. \nO'CONNELL Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go. \nJONATHAN And then he'll be coming after Evy. \nThey turn and race out of the office. \nBRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT \nA FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a severe sickness -- it's already too late. \nImhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his side, looking very nervous. \nAnd then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS AND SORES. \nINT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT \nO'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum. \nEVELYN Last month I came across an inscription that mentioned The Book Of The Dead. \nDANIELS That book we found at Hamunaptra? \nEVELYN Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked about bringing people back from the dead. A notion I was unwilling to believe. \nO'CONNELL Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life. \nJONATHAN And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back \nARDETH RAY And if he succeeds, the two of them together will bring about the apocalypse. \nThe Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit. \nTHE CURATOR The plagues we have seen so far, are merely Imhotep flexing his muscles. Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's resurrection will he be truly invincible. \nThey reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them. \nEVELYN I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life -- \nCURATOR -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld. \nEVELYN Exactly -- \nO'CONNELL So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold -- \nCURATOR -- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it. \nO'CONNELL You think it'll send this guy back to hell? \nCURATOR Correct, And that's when -- \nLOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside. They all rush over to the upper windows and look down -- OUTSIDE: A large, CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores comes CHANTING up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!' \nARDETH RAY It has begun. The beginning of the end. \nEVELYN Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon. \nEvelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows. \nEXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT \nThe crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway. \nINT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT \nThe BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets. \nThe others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece. \nEVELYN Got it! \nO'CONNELL Got what? \nThe BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn talks while quickly translating the tablet: \nEVELYN Since the black Book of The Dead was found inside the statue of Anubis, then according to this, the golden Book of The Living should be inside... \nEvelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles. \nO'CONNELL What? \nJONATHAN What? \nDANIELS WHAT!? \nEVELYN The golden Book Of The Living, is inside the statue of Horus. \nCURATOR Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue. \nO'CONNELL Don't tell me we gotta go back out there? \nCURATOR If we want to kill the creature, yes. \nTWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway, SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray grab them and chuck them over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN, The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul ass across the balcony and down the staircase. \nEXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT \nO'CONNELL Got guts, lady. \nEVELYN Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them. \nImhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and -- RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET. \nJONATHAN Hey that's mine -- ! \nArdeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away. \nO'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of Ardeth Ray's grip. \nO'CONNELL Evelyn! \nThe huge, powerful man holds him tight. \nARDETH RAY Be calm. There is still time. We can stop him yet. \nThe crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep stops and looks back at O'Connell. \nIMHOTEP Pared oos. \nEvelyn SCREAMS. \nEVELYN NOOO!! \nBeni smiles. \nBENI Kill them. \nImhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's grip and stumbles forward. \nO'CONNELL EVELYN! \nBut the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill. \nO'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole. \nCURATOR Go! Find a way! Kill the creature! \nThe Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator apart. \nINT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nO'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats. \nO'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell. \nFIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies. \nSTREET - ALLEY - NIGHT \nThe EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air, followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE... \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nA sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY. \nO'CONNELL We gotta get her back. \nJONATHAN I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it. \nO'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray. \nO'CONNELL You know where he's taking her? \nARDETH RAY Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual. \nJonathan looks worried. \nJONATHAN And what ritual would that be? \nARDETH RAY The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life. \nJONATHAN And how does one do that? \nARDETH RAY By reading the Book Of The Dead. \nJONATHAN Oh yes, of course. \nARDETH RAY And then killing your sister. \nJONATHAN Excuse me? \nArdeth Ray looks at O'Connell. \nARDETH RAY Imhotep is now able to cross the desert with great haste. \nThe biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING. Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston Havlock LAUGHING. \nWINSTON Here I come, laddies! \nO'Connell braces himself for impact, \nSAHARA - DAY \nEvelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep. \nEVELYN Stop it! You'll kill them! \nImhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard. \nEvelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs. \nEXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY \nThe biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside- down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down. \nJONATHAN Excuse me... A little help would be useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE!! \nO'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead. \nA smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away. \nO'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND... \nHAMUNAPTRA - DAY \nO'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra. \nO'CONNELL Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like? \nJONATHAN He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon. \nO'CONNELL Got it. \nHAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY \nCarrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell. \nNECROPOLIS - DAY \nEvelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his rifle into her back and pushes her forward. \nBENI Keep moving. \nEvelyn gives him a look. \nEVELYN You know, nasty little fellows such as yourself, always get their comeuppance. \nBeni suddenly looks worried. \nBENI Yeah? \nEVELYN Oh yes, always. \nBeni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY \nO'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall. \nJONATHAN I say, look at that. \nHe walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE. \nJONATHAN Say, gents! You should come have a look at this. \nThe wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM. \nO'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away. \nThe scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job. \nO'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM! \nINT. CEMETERY - DAY \nThe GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life. \nImhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE. \nEvelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed. \nTWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests. \nARDETH RAY My turn. \nArdeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now. \nO'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway. \nThen Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels and rolls about. \nINT. CEMETERY - DAY \nEvelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. She blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS. \nINT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY \nThe elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them. \nO'CONNELL This whole place is comin, alive! \nThe men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical. Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty. \nARDETH RAY I'm out. \nHe throws the machine-gun down and they all race into -- \nHORUS' CHAMBER - DAY \n-- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber. \nJONATHAN There he is! \nThey run up to the base of the statue, \nJONATHAN Hello Horus old boy. \nO'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder. \nARDETH RAY Allow me. \nO'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS. \nArdeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES. \nRipping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way out, -- another dark, creepy passageway. \nINT. CEMETERY \nChained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths in the room. \nImhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed cheek. \nINT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY \nO'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up. \nO'CONNELL These guys just don't quit. \nArdeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells and runs off towards the mummies. \nARDETH RAY Keep digging! \nO'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give. \nThe last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember? \nOur heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts... \nAnd that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor. \nOne of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard. \nAN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly. \nINT. CEMETERY \nImhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead. \nA large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. \nEvelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror. \nINT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY \nArdeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag. \nHe and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces as they stare at it in wonder. \nThe elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel and wades into the remaining mummies swinging. \n", "test1_input": "INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY \nWHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited. \nEVELYN Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl. \nO'CONNELL You dream about dead guys? \nEvelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes. \nEVELYN Look, all the sacred spells have been chiseled off. The hieratics and hieroglyphs that protect the deceased on his journey into the afterlife, they've been removed. This man was cursed,... doomed. \nO'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care. \nO'CONNELL Tough break. \nJONATHAN Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we? \nEvelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs \nthe lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly. \nAnd then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP! \nO'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN AHHHHH!!! \nThey all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the 'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin. \nINT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY \nHenderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background, Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets. \nBENI The curse,... beware the curse! \nBeni turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits. \nDANIELS Stupid superstitious bastard. \nAnd that's when the seal breaks, -- A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud. \nINT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY \nO'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out. \nO'CONNELL Is he supposed to look like that? \nEVELYN No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still... \nJONATHAN Juicy? \nEVELYN Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing. \nO'CONNELL And look at this. \nO'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside. \nEVELYN Oh my god, he was buried alive. \nThis sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer. \nEVELYN And he left a message. \nWE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD. \nEVELYN It says: 'Death is only the beginning.' \nJonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around. \nO'CONNELL Where's my gun? \nJONATHAN What are you going to do? Shoot him? \nO'CONNELL If he decides to wake up, hell yes! \nINT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY \nThe vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to life. \nEGYPTOLOGIST I have heard told of this book, but I never truly believed it existed. This, good gentlemen, is a most priceless treasure. \nHenderson kicks the sandy floor in anger. \nHENDERSON I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon! \nDANIELS Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold! \nDaniels kicks the chest. It breaks open, unfolding to reveal a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels) \n", "test1_true": "The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell. \nJONATHAN What is this stuff? It smells like our late friend, the Warden. \nO'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified. \nJONATHAN You did not!?... We're not!? \nO'CONNELL Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer. \nThe gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars. \nHENDERSON Say O'Connell, whadaya think these honey's'll fetch back home? \nBURNS We hear you gentlemen found yerselves a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations. \nDANIELS Ya know if ya dry him out, you can sell him for firewood. \nThe Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground. \nEVELYN Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them inside our friend's coffin. They can stay alive for years living off the flesh of a corpse, or in this case... \nShe shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat \nEVELYN Famished. \nO'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted. \nO'CONNELL Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive? \nEVELYN Very slowly. \nJONATHAN He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him. \nO'CONNELL Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter. \nEVELYN According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed. \nO'CONNELL That bad huh? \nEVELYN Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt. \nO'CONNELL The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues. \nBENI Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy? \nEVELYN That's one way of putting it. \nJONATHAN Let's see, there was frogs, flies, locusts... \nBURNS Hail and fire. \nHENDERSON The sun turning black. \nDANIELS Water turning to blood. \nJONATHAN And my personal favorite: people covered in boils and sores. \nAll the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire. \nEVELYN Fried gizzard anyone? \nEXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT \nHaving just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away. \nLying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book. \nO'CONNELL You sure you outta be playin, around with that? \nEVELYN It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book. \nEvelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading. \nEVELYN Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei. \nEvelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN. \nINT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - NIGHT \nEvelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills FRAME, -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN! \nRevealing EMPTY SOCKETS. -- BIG SCARY MUSIC STING. \nEXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 1362, "test2_input": "Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice. \nO'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself. \nO'CONNELL I told ya, I already got him! \nArdeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious. \nARDETH RAY Know this, the creature will be coming for you. He must consummate the curse. And until he does, he will never eat, he will never sleep, and he will never stop. \nArdeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice, \nEXT. RUINS - NIGHT \nO'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist, still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another. \nThey all head off into the dark, windblown desert... \nAnd then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC, PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE -- \nIMHOTEP ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!! \nEXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY \nA British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front gate. Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter. \nINT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY \nA steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open. \nO'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk. \nO'CONNELL I thought you didn't believe in this stuff!? \nO'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses \nEVELYN Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one. \nO'CONNELL Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone. \nEVELYN No, we are not. \nO'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk. \nO'CONNELL Oh yes we are. \nO'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues to UNPACK them: \nEVELYN No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him. \nO'CONNELL We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing. \nEVELYN Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him. \nO'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands. \nO'CONNELL How!? You heard the man, no mortal weapons can kill this guy. \nEvelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer. \nEVELYN Then we'll have to find some immortal ones. \nO'CONNELL There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here! \nO'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk. \nEvelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers. \nO'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking his fingers as Evelyn follows him. \nEVELYN According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed. \nO'CONNELL Yeah? So? Is that my problem? \nEVELYN (incredulous) It's everybody's problem! \nO'CONNELL Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated. \nEVELYN That's what I am to you? A contract? \nO'CONNELL You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot. \nEVELYN I'm staying. \nO'CONNELL FINE. \nO'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door. \n", "test2_true": "O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised. \nO'CONNELL Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to? \nBENI You left me! You left me in the desert to rot. \nO'CONNELL Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. (gestures to Imhotep) So who's this guy? \nBENI This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris. \nO'CONNELL Oh, hey, how ya doin'? \nO'Connell sticks out his hand, -- Imhotep instantly recoils O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers. \nBENI The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid. \nO'CONNELL Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we? \nBENI He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible. \nO'CONNELL Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples. \nBENI Do you know where I can steal some? \nO'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives Imhotep a look as he strides off. \nO'CONNELL See ya around, Padre. \nImhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask. \nINT. CASBAH - DAY \nThe proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and hard liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers. \nHe wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK. \nWINSTON I'm the last of the Royal Force still stationed here, you know? All the other laddies died in the air and were buried in the sand. \nThe tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat. \nWINSTON Ever since the end of the Great War, there hasn't been a single challenge worthy of a man like me. \nO'CONNELL I've heard it before, Winston. \nO'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan. \nWINSTON I just wish I would've chucked it with the other laddies, gone down in a flame of glory, instead of sitting around here, rotting from boredom and booze! \nJonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them. \nBurns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment. \nBURNS The drawer there, spectacles. (tries to laugh) As you see, I won't be needing them. \nImhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He puts the bifocals on over his death mask, -- and grins broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole. \nBENI Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks you for your spectacles, -- and for your eyes,... and for your tongue. \nThe expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled. \nBENI But I am afraid more is needed, the Prince says he must finish the job, consummate the curse which you and your friends have brought down upon yourselves. \nA look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL. \nINT. CASBAH - DAY \nThree shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and Henderson slug 'em down, -- all three of them instantly SPIT OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well. \nHENDERSON Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,... like... \nO'CONNELL Blood. \nThey all look at each other, even more nervous. \nJONATHAN \"And the rivers and waters of Egypt went red and were as blood.\" \nA look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization. \nO'CONNELL He's here. \nHe suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door. \nJONATHAN Who's here!? \nO'CONNELL The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY! \n", "test2_id": 1363, "test3_input": "The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares angrily down. Jonathan stares back. \nJONATHAN Oh boy. \nO'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis. \nO'CONNELL This just keeps gettin, better and better. \nImhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue. \nO'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts. \nImhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away. \nO'CONNELL Do something, Jonathan! Kill it! \nJONATHAN You have got to be joking? \nEvelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun. \nEVELYN Finish the inscription, idiot! \nJONATHAN Oh. \nAnck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure -- \nJONATHAN Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here? \nEVELYN What's it look like!? \nAnck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares at the inscription, slightly oblivious. \nJONATHAN It's an Anck symbol, with two little squiggly lines above it, and a bird, a stork! on either side. \nEvelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun. \nEVELYN Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus! \nJONATHAN Yes,... I see. \nThe talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him. \nJONATHAN Hootash im Ahmenophus! \nThe giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to powder and DRIVING her into the ground. \nImhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly backpedals on his hands and heels. \nO'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall. \nO'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP! \nSLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins. \nO'CONNELL Okay pal, let's see how tough you are without your right arm. \nImhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes it off. \nO'CONNELL Alright,... so he's left handed. \nImhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn. \nJONATHAN I got it! \nEvelyn runs for Jonathan. \nO'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy. \nImhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back. \nO'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air, \nSLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with him. \nHe bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet. \nTotally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand. \nJonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them. \nImhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm. \nNo matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and casually flings it away. \nThe golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages looking for something. \nO'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About to die. \n", "test3_true": "EVELYN Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! PARED OOS!! \nImhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open. \nAnd then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air. \nImhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground. \nEvelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like he's about to cry. \nTen feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT. \nAccompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact. \nO'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal. \nO'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus bog. The sword still in his stomach. \nEvelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN. \nEvelyn translates: \nEVELYN Death is only the beginning. \nImhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile. \nSTAFF CHAMBER - DAY \nBeni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large, ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted. \nA BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION. \nBeni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear. \nALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber. \nCEMETERY - DAY \nO'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand. \nO'CONNELL C'mon! \nHe pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY \nBeni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees. \nINT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY \nO'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of the sinking walls is deafening. \nBeni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap. \nThen O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives, but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half. \nO'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand -- \nBENI O'CONNELL!! \nO'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor. \nSealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks around with his diminishing torch. \nAll the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING. \nBeni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away. \nBENI Go away. \nHe stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him. \nBeni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in. \nAnd that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT. \nAnd then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain. \nAnd the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily. \nEXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY \nThe temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously. \nThey make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels race out into the desert... \n", "test3_id": 1364}

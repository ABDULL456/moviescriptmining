CRACK! \nBut on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES. \nEvelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard. \nO'CONNELL Evelyn! Slow down! \nEvelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate. \nO'CONNELL SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S A REALLY BIG -- \nINT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY \nEvelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes. \nO'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel. \nO'CONNELL Never mind. \nThe Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin. \nO'CONNELL You boys owe me five hundred dollars. \nEXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY \nUnder the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps. \nDANIELS Where'd all these camels come from? \nBENI They belong to the dead. They will wait years for their masters to return before leaving. \nEXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY \nO'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins. \nO'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS. \nJONATHAN That thing gives me the creeps. \nO'CONNELL Be nice. That thing saved my life. \nEvelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice. \nEVELYN That \"thing\" gets me excited. \nO'CONNELL (sarcastic) The things that get you excited. \nEVELYN According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living. \nO'CONNELL What are those mirrors for? \nEVELYN Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see. \nO'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice. \nINT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY \nO'Connell waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness. \nEVELYN Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years. \nWARDEN Who cares? I don't see no treasure. \nO'CONNELL You're welcome to my share of the spider webs. \nJONATHAN And it stinks to high heaven in here. \nEvelyn just rolls her eyes. \nEVELYN Cretins. \nJonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden and realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops sniffing. \nEvelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall, then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. -- THE RAY OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's chamber. \nO'CONNELL That is a neat trick. \nEVELYN Oh my god, It's a preparation room. \nO'CONNELL Preparation for what? \nEVELYN For entering the afterlife. \nO'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him. \nJONATHAN Mummies, my good son, this is where they made the mummies. \n", "test1_true": "INT. LABYRINTH - DAY \nO'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls. \nThey share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS. \nO'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him. \nANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY \nThey slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis. \nThen they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER! \nO'Connell LEAPS OUT. -- THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed. \nHENDERSON Ya scared the bejeezus out of us, O'Connell. \nO'CONNELL Likewise. \nBut nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one. \nDANIELS This here is our statue,... friend. \nO'CONNELL Don't see your name on it,... pal. \nAnd that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step out of the shadows, -- all holding guns aimed at O'Connell. \nBENI Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good. \nO'CONNELL I've had worse. \nJonathan clenches a tiny derringer. \nJONATHAN Yes, me too. \nO'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun, grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down. \nEVELYN Let's be nice, children, if we're going to play together, we must learn to share. \nEvelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow. \nBeni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing. \nThe Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs. \nINT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY \nO'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel. \nEVELYN According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs. (she blushes and laughs) Oh my. \nJONATHAN And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep -- (looks at O'Connell) No offense. \nO'CONNELL None taken. \nJONATHAN We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them. \nO'CONNELL And you're sure you can find the secret compartment? \nEVELYN Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't already found it. \nJonathan looks around. \nJONATHAN I say, what's our smelly little friend got himself up to? \nINT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY \nThe Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH. \nA mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and starts prying away at one of the precious bugs. \nINT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY \nBeni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist brushes sand away from the seam. Henderson steps forward and grabs the seam, -- the Egyptologist quickly stops him. \nEGYPTOLOGIST Seti was no fool. \nHenderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes \nHENDERSON Yeah, sure... \nHe looks back at the native Diggers. \nHENDERSON We'll let him open it. \n", "test1_id": 1362, "test2_input": "The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers. \nThe Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless. \nBeni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back away as well. \nINT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY \nThree Heroes are still digging into the ceiling \nO'CONNELL Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils? \nJONATHAN OWCH! That's really got to hurt. \nEVELYN It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this \nJONATHAN Still... \nO'CONNELL Yeah, that'd bring you back to life. \nEVELYN You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys. \nAnd that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT. \nO'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room. \nINT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER \nHaving heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS -- \nEGYPTOLOGIST FENI! \nThe three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers give one final pull and -- \n-- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM. \nDying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the ground... \nINT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY \nThe dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement. \nWe immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS. \nEVELYN Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus. \nO'CONNELL Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling? \nEVELYN They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty. \nINT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY \nThe warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing. \nCLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM. \nThe amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon. \nThen it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly burrows into the leather and vanishes inside. \nThe Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and COUGHING. \nAnd then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD. \nINT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY \nOur Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid. \nJONATHAN Well?... Who is it? \nEvelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned. \nEVELYN 'He that shall not be named.' \nO'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK \nO'CONNELL There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior? \nEVELYN Quarried granite with a cobalt lining. \nJONATHAN Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out. \nO'CONNELL No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing, \nEVELYN A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about. \nO'CONNELL Who was talking about what? \n", "test2_true": "EVELYN The man on the barge. The one with the hook, he was looking for a key. \nEvelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back. \nJONATHAN Hey that's mine! \nEvelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles. \nAnd that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running. \nINT. LABYRINTH - DAY \nThe Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head. \nO'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open. \nO'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves... \nEXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT \nEvelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire. \nEVELYN What do you suppose killed him? \nJONATHAN Did you ever see him eat? \nO'Connell comes up over some rocks. \nO'CONNELL Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed. \nEVELYN How? \nO'CONNELL Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap. \nJONATHAN Maybe this place really is cursed. \nA GUST OF WIND blows through the camp. \nThe campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous look. Evelyn laughs. \nEVELYN You two! \nO'CONNELL You don't believe in curses, huh? \nEVELYN No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe. \nO'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin. \nO'CONNELL I believe in being prepared. \nJonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, -- Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump. \nO'CONNELL/EVELYN WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?! \nJonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off. \nJONATHAN Seagrams! \nJonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it. \nJONATHAN Well, he may have been a stinky fellow,... but he had good taste. \nJonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp. \nO'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn. \nO'CONNELL Stay here! \nHe takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her. \nJONATHAN Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man just say -- ! \nEXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT \nThe American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY. \nO'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there. \nO'CONNELL Goin' somewhere? \nBENI Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend! \nO'Connell drags him back towards the American camp. \nO'CONNELL C'mon, friend. \n", "test2_id": 1363, "test3_input": "A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a severe sickness -- it's already too late. \nImhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his side, looking very nervous. \nAnd then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS AND SORES. \nINT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT \nO'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum. \nEVELYN Last month I came across an inscription that mentioned The Book Of The Dead. \nDANIELS That book we found at Hamunaptra? \nEVELYN Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked about bringing people back from the dead. A notion I was unwilling to believe. \nO'CONNELL Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life. \nJONATHAN And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back \nARDETH RAY And if he succeeds, the two of them together will bring about the apocalypse. \nThe Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit. \nTHE CURATOR The plagues we have seen so far, are merely Imhotep flexing his muscles. Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's resurrection will he be truly invincible. \nThey reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them. \nEVELYN I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life -- \nCURATOR -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld. \nEVELYN Exactly -- \nO'CONNELL So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold -- \nCURATOR -- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it. \nO'CONNELL You think it'll send this guy back to hell? \nCURATOR Correct, And that's when -- \nLOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside. They all rush over to the upper windows and look down -- OUTSIDE: A large, CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores comes CHANTING up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!' \nARDETH RAY It has begun. The beginning of the end. \nEVELYN Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon. \nEvelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows. \nEXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT \nThe crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway. \nINT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT \nThe BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets. \nThe others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece. \nEVELYN Got it! \nO'CONNELL Got what? \nThe BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn talks while quickly translating the tablet: \nEVELYN Since the black Book of The Dead was found inside the statue of Anubis, then according to this, the golden Book of The Living should be inside... \nEvelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles. \nO'CONNELL What? \nJONATHAN What? \nDANIELS WHAT!? \nEVELYN The golden Book Of The Living, is inside the statue of Horus. \nCURATOR Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue. \nO'CONNELL Don't tell me we gotta go back out there? \nCURATOR If we want to kill the creature, yes. \nTWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway, SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray grab them and chuck them over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into the lower display cases.

Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it up and 180's it back over to the bushes. \nO'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Ray and the Curator jump inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them. \nBENI Imhotep! IMHOTEP! \nImhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points a finger at Beni as they race past him. \nO'CONNELL You're gonna get yours, pal! \nImhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS. \nHis disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car. \nEXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT \nThe convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street. \nCrazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear. \nThe mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared. \nWE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM... \nINT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT \nThe convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back. \nAll of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out. \nThen suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn. \nO'CONNELL C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go! \nThey all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the lit match near the fuse. \nThe crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes. \nAnd then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him. \nEVELYN He's gorgeous. \nO'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head. \nTHE CURATOR He has consummated the curse, now all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun from the dead, then it will be the end of us, and the beginning for them. \nImhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops, watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn. \nIMHOTEP Koontash dai na. \nBeni steps through the swarming mass, translating. \nBENI Take his hand and he will spare the others. \nEvelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell. \nEVELYN Any bright ideas? \nO'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth. \nO'CONNELL Sorry, fresh out. \nEvelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, -- but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight. \nO'CONNELL Don't do it, Evelyn. \nEVELYN I have no choice. \nEvelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles. \nIMHOTEP Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan. \nBENI Come with me my princess. It is time to make you mine, forever. \nEvelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him -- \nEVELYN All eternity, idiot. \nThen she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face. \nEVELYN You better think of something, because if he turns me into a mummy, you're the first one I'm coming after. \nO'Connell almost smiles. \n", "test3_id": 1364}

149:  INT.  WAITING AREA.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. 
HELENA waits on a bench in the empty room. Maybe a few scruffy magazines? But nothing of use to her in here except she's near Berlin. He arrives like every hope got abandoned and sits next to her. They clasp one another's hands before she embraces him. 
BERLIN You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart .. 
HELENA I wanna be near you ... 
Something difficult to tell her and doesn't know how to say it. 
BERLIN I think they're gonna arrest me. 
HELENA I don't want them to arrest you. 
BERLIN It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is .. 
Her tears are close to his face. No one but him could hear her. 
HELENA Oh, John, I'd do anything, anything, to get you free. 
150:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. 
If the waiting room felt bad try sitting in here. Both St ANNE and TAYLOR are smoking and the Sony playing again. This is the final part of the tape. No speech but a lot of labored breath- ing. Ross groaning and now the sound of his shotgun. More desp- erate inhalations and now sound of the last shot into his neck. 
St ANNE .. and that one's with malice .. that one's first degree .. why don't you stop lying to me? (Clicks Sony off) C'mon, John, I can help you? Why don't you tell me the truth? 
BERLIN I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life .. 
TAYLOR I've heard you call him Freddy. 
BERLIN You haven't. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, so keep it shut. 
St ANNE Tell a lotta lies, don't you? Some- thing that comes naturally to you? 
BERLIN I don't lie. 
St ANNE Prepared to lie to your Chief? 
BERLIN Under exceptional circumstances. 
St ANNE What were the circumstances that caused you to lie to Freddy Ross? 
BERLIN I never lied to Ross .. 
St ANNE You didn't? 
Shakes his head in confirmation. And St ANNE finds a notebook. 
Well, he thought you did? .. Wrote it down in his book? "John Berlin is a liar." Right here, underlined. 
BERLIN stares at the book & can barely credit what he's seeing. 
Dated the day you got your first "break" with your "Mystery Man?" You don't know why he wrote that? (He doesn't) Maybe he thought there was no "Myst- ery Man?" That the investigation was bullshit? That you were making it up? 
And during the next attack St ANNE will work himself into rage. 
Coz you wanted to be "Top Cop?" Isn't that why you went running up that gar- bage dump, so everyone could stand in awe of the "Top Cop?" Isn't that why you came up here? Coz you couldn't make it in L.A.? Get yourself a pissy lit- tle degree, come up here, and be "Top Guy?" But Ross was "Top Guy", wasn't he? Always would be Top Guy? And you know what? He did it without even trying .. Everybody loved him. He had everything you wanted, didn't he? - Great woman - Great kid? - Everything you couldn't have? - And you wanted it to go away? Coz your life was lousy, wasn't it? - A lousy life, with a lousy wife, who was fucking everyone, wasn't she? Is that why you pick on a little Blind Girl? - coz you can control her? - Is that it? - Control who she's fucking? 
Tears of grief and tears of rage. BERLIN can't restrain either. 
You wanna lose your temper with me? C'mon, John, lose your fucken temper? You're good at losing your temper?.. 
BERLIN No way, Mr St Anne. 
St ANNE Lost your temper with Ross, didn't you? C'mon, tell me the truth. Is that what happened? You had an arg- ument in the car? Lost your temper with him? Stood over him, blew his fucking larynx out with a Glaser? - Where were you aiming, John? Going for his face? Blow his fucking face away, because you hated him so much. 
BERLIN is a wreck of despair. But somehow he keeps his dignity. 
BERLIN I loved that guy .. & the hard- est thing to take in here .. is knowing he thought I killed him .. 
St ANNE Well, that he did .. And that do I, Sergeant Berlin .. 
And at last he looks pleased. Because he's got this man busted. 
What do you take for that breathlessness, Sergeant? 
Can't take anymore questions. Answers with a shake of his head. 
How about Aminophylline? 
BERLIN I don't know what that is. 
St ANNE You don't? It's ant anti-asthma medic- ation, prescribed for breathlessness? 
Produces a capsule in a plastic bag and throws it on the table. 
Came out of the ashtray of your car? 
Every cell in BERLIN's body freezes. Misinterpreted by St ANNE. 
But you "don't know" what it is?

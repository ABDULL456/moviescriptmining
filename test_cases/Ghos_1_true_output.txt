CARL What are you doing to me. Get away! Get away! 
INT. KITCHEN 
Sam does not go away. Freaked, Carl runs into the kitchen and rushes to the stove. Quickly he turns on the gas. He looks crazed. Turning to the air, he begins whispering loudly. 
CARL You touch me again and I'll set her on fire. I mean it. I'll kill her. I'll blow up the whole building if I have to. Stay away! 
Sam jabs at the knob on the stove and begins to turn it off. Carl sees it move. Shocked and frightened, he grabs it and pulls it off, leaving only the tiny stem in place. 
CARL (continuing) Go on, try it again. Let me see you turn it off now. 
Sam, frightened, tries with all his might but he cannot twist it. Carl pulls out a cigarette lighter and gloats. 
CARL (continuing) Try and hurt me. I'll kill her if you hurt me. 
Sam rushes at Carl about to jam his full fist into his chest, but then he stops, afraid. He pulls back, shaken. Carl stands there waiting for a blow that doesn't come. He begins to gloat. 
CARL What's a matter? You believe me, huh? You better believe me! I want my money. I need that money and I want it tonight -- at 11:00. If that psychic lady doesn't bring it here, Molly's dead. 
Sam freezes. Molly enters the kitchen. She grabs her nose. 
MOLLY Oh my God. Is that the gas? 
Carl acts as if that's the reason he came into the kitchen. 
CARL You must have left the stove on. 
He fiddles with the dials and turns it off. 
CARL (continuing) Just glad I smelled it. 
MOLLY (confused) Me, too. 
She opens a window. 
CARL Molly, I'm sorry. I've got to go. Look, there's something going on. I can't talk now. Some trouble at the bank. 
MOLLY Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is it that woman, the psychic? 
CARL I don't have time to talk now. What if I come back? Around 11:00? 
MOLLY Carl, what's going on? Let me help you. 
CARL I can't. I'm sorry to do this, but it's important. I'll be back. 
Molly is speechless. 
CARL (continuing) Eleven!

Oda Mae is watching T.V. with Clara and Louise. Suddenly she jumps, aware of Sam's presence in the room. 
ODA MAE Sam! 
Clara and Louise jump, too. 
CLARA Not again! 
ODA MAE What're you doin' here? 
SAM Oda Mae! We're in trouble. They want the check. They're comin' to kill you. We gotta get outta here. 
ODA MAE The check? What do you mean, "the check". You said they'd never find out. 
CLARA (afraid) What's happenin' Oda Mae?

A red Mustang SCREECHES to a stop on the street below. Sam and Oda Mae run to the window. Carl and Willie are looking up.

INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  TOMOKOS ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Theres a baseball game on, but the sound is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly. 
MASAMI They say that some elementary school kid spent the night with his parents at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid wanted to go out and play with everybody, right, but he didnt want to miss the program he always used to watch back in Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in their room.  But of course the stations in Izu are different from the ones in Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty channel, so he shouldve recorded nothing but static.  But when the kid gets back to his house and watches the tape, all of a sudden this woman comes on the screen and says-- 
Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko actually jumps in her seat. 
MASAMI (contd) One week from now, you will die. 
Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment. 
MASAMI (contd) Of course the kids completely freaked, and he stops the video. Just then the phone rings, and when he picks it up a voice says-- 
Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper. 
MASAMI (contd) You watched it, didnt you?  That same time, exactly one week later... hes dead! 
Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance. Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more and more distressed, until finally Masami notices. 
MASAMI What is it, Tomoko? 
Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her friend.  Her words are quick, earnest. 
TOMOKO Who did you hear that story from? 
MASAMI Who?  Its just a rumor.  Everybody knows it. 
TOMOKO Youko told you? 
MASAMI No, it wasnt Youko... 
Tomoko looks away, worried.  Masami slaps her on the knee, laughing.

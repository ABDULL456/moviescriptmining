SAM Jesus Christ... 
He tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs -- 
JEREMY Come here! 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her. The FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above... 
JEREMY Sam! Stop! 
Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it dead on with his shins and goes head over heels -- 
JEREMY (CONT'D) FUCK! 
He picks himself up and charges even faster -- 
INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT 
Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the floor. He looks up when he senses someone approaching... 
EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT 
Sam sprints by the area of Vietnam Tom's squatting ground. FIREWORKS continue to EXPLODE and shower overhead, and some PEOPLE can be HEARD LAUGHING and SHOUTING from the main parking area, not far away... 
Sam runs toward the VOICES -- 
But Jeremy grabs her from behind and spins her around! 
SAM Why are you doing this? 
JEREMY I just wanna talk to you! 
She struggles against his grip. The EXPLOSIONS and the RUCKUS from CROWD mask their noise. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Stop it! 
Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin. He starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her across the face -- 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Fucking bitch! 
Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and shoves her hard -- 
Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the metal BUNNY MASK. She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple... 
She struggles no more. 
INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT 
Tom stands in his cell to meet the entity that approaches... 
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT 
Chris and the other Employees stop working and look up at the sky, now roiling with sinister, SUPERNATURAL CLOUDS... 
EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT 
Jeremy slowly creeps to where Sam lies... Her eyes are open and she is completely still. 
JEREMY Sam?... 
Jeremy crouches beside her, and when he puts two fingers to her neck to feel for a pulse, he starts to tremble... 
The raining METEORS and FIREWORKS illuminate the SMOKE and the BLACK CLOUDS overhead... 
INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT 
Vietnam Tom walks up to the CELL BARS... 
He comes face to face with Sam. 
She stares back at him through the bars from the other side. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and the BANDAGE. Light glints off the METAL lodged in her HEAD WOUND. 
I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/LOOKOUT - NIGHT 
Jeremy speeds frantically down the hill, away from the parking area and the continuing fireworks display. Tears stream down his cheeks... 
He cuts the wheel when a pair of HEADLIGHTS blind him and a vehicle cuts him off. His car skids out, and he sees it's CHRIS' TRUCK that has almost hit him. 
Chris jumps out, yanks open Jeremy's door and grabs him by the shirt collar. He yells over the FIREWORKS: 
CHRIS Where the hell is Sam? 
JEREMY (FRANTIC) I don't know... I don't know...

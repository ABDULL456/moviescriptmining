EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE THAT NIGHT 
Adele steps out of the trailer. 
ADELE Early? 
She walks carefully around the junk piles. It's dark; hard to see. She comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers in... She can't see anything but hears the rustling of a shovel digging. 
ADELE Early? You down there? 
The sound of digging stops. 
EARLY (from inside the hole) What's up Adele? Dinner ready? 
ADELE Almost. 
After a moment's hesitation, Early resumes his digging. 
ADELE Early... 
The digging stops again. 
ADELE Tell me more about California. 
The moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her. 
EARLY Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact. 
ADELE I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here. 
EARLY Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... (beat) ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month... 
ADELE What'll we do out there? 
EARLY Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon... 
Early lets out a playful howl, as Adele looks up over her shoulder at the moon. 
ADELE You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind. 
EARLY Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it. 
Adele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer. 
ADELE Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready. 
EARLY I heard that. 
After a moment, Early climbs out of the hole and stands in the moonlight for a moment. We see that he's completely naked except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. Early gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon. 
EXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - DAWN 
Brian exits loft carrying two bags. Carrie is also carrying a bag, and smoking a cigarette, as they walk to the car. 
CARRIE What did he sound like on the phone? 
OMITTED 
BRIAN Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.' 
Brian throws the bags in the open trunk with the other bags. 
BRIAN (grins) I like that. 
CARRIE I still think we should have met them first. 
BRIAN Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember? 
Carrie bows her head and folds her hands in mock prayer. 
CARRIE Please God, we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week, don't let them be as boring as Brian's friends. Anything... but that. 
Brian throws a needling glance to Carrie and slams the car hood shut. They both get into the car, Brian behind the wheel. 
INT. LINCOLN 
BRIAN Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance." (quotes from the movie) "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!" 
CARRIE Funny, very funny. 
Brian starts the car. It backfires loudly startling Carrie. Brian laughs. 
BRIAN (quoting again) "Aintry? This river don't go to Aintry." 
EXT. LINCOLN ON STREET 
The engine revs again and the Lincoln pulls away down the street. 
EXT. BUS STATION - DAWN 
PAN UP from Adele's new red high-heeled shoes. We hear Adele speaking with an unfamiliar tone of authority to her voice. 
ADELE We shouldn't be doin' this, Early. You leavin' the state, ridin' around with strangers... besides, what kinda people would want to stop at places where other people was murdered. 
The camera slowly reveals Adele... and the fact that she is alone as she voices her concerns. Then from behind her Early approaches. Just in time to hear...

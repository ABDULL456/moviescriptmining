BLOOM Good. 
They smile when they see Stephen and the Chink at a table. 
Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with them. Bloom glares at the Curator, but speaks to Stephen. 
BLOOM (cont'd) What's he doing here? 
STEPHEN I invited him, sit down. This ship's too small to dance around each other for a week, we might as well have it out now. Bloom. Sit. Penelope, do you know our friend? 
PENELOPE Only as the creepy Frenchman. 
THE CURATOR Book-learned. You know languages but not accents, my dear. I am Belgian. Maxmillion Melville, at your service. 
BLOOM Also known in certain professional circles as the Curator. 
PENELOPE Pleased to make your acquaintance. What do you do? 
THE CURATOR I'm a curator, presently for the National Museum in Prague. And yourself? 
PENELOPE I'm an epileptic photographer. 
THE CURATOR Good for you. Boys? What do you do?

STEPHEN We have a legitimate antique reselling business. 
THE CURATOR Baissez le rideau, la farce est jouee. 
STEPHEN We've gone straight, Max. 
THE CURATOR Pardon, but you do not ascend to the grand heights of the Brothers Bloom only to toss it all and sell terra cotta to blue haired weekend antiquers. 
STEPHEN We did.   Eat your waffles. 
THE CURATOR But Mademoiselle appears... confused. Perhaps she is unawares? 
BLOOM Eat your waffles, fat man. 
THE CURATOR Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are in fact the two most highly respected art smugglers in the western world? 
STEPHEN Were. We've been on the straight for three years. So that's that. 
THE CURATOR Well, if that is that, then that is indeed that. As you say. 
Penelope snaps her fingers.     Everyone looks up. 
PENELOPE Your name's Melville? 
THE CURATOR Maxmillion Melville, Esquire. 
79   CONTINUED: (2)                                            79 
PENELOPE Sorry, no, cause I noticed but I couldn't place it, this ship is the Fidele, which was the ship in Melville's novel "The Confidence Man." So that's weird. 
Everyone glances at Stephen, a little uncomfortable. 
STEPHEN Huh. 
80   INT. DECK - NIGHT                                         80 
Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards. 
BLOOM I know you like to throw those clever little details in, but you've gotta watch that shit with her Stephen. She had a lot of time alone in that house, and she used it. She did the best Double Dutch Queens I've ever seen up on the deck last night. 
STEPHEN Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed cards. 
BLOOM She had them in her purse and cut them in while I was folding my napkin. 
STEPHEN Jesus. 
BLOOM That's what I'm saying. She's different, she knows, sometimes it feels like she knows everything. Doesn't that worry you? 
STEPHEN No. But something about her is worrying you plenty. 
BLOOM She feels like one of your characters. 
80   CONTINUED:                                                     80 
STEPHEN The day I con you is the day I die, Bloom. 
BLOOM I know that. (beat) How did you get the Belgian, on our budget? 
STEPHEN He's beautiful, right? 
BLOOM I didn't expect him to actually be Belgian. 
STEPHEN I'm not sure he is.   I'm to bed. 
Stephen stands to go, then pauses. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) I've always protected you, right? The only real danger in this whole play is that you'll actually fall in love with her. Look at me. Don't fall in love with her.

OUTER SPACE                                       1 \nThe infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars. As we slowly DESCEND through the varied shades of blue of the Earth's atmosphere, we HEAR the first strains of a haunting, Central American FLUTE, joined by a swelling background of JUNGLE SOUNDS.  We descend further, through a lush JUNGLE CANOPY, backlit by a setting sun. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n2     EXT. JUNGLE COASTLINE - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)               2 \nThrough a collage of shimmering HEAT-WAVES, a dark, OTHER-WORLDLY OBJECT drops INTO VIEW, backlit by the fiery, ORANGE-RED sphere of a setting tropical SUN, heading slowly towards us, floating, as if suspended by the rising heat of the jungle. \nContinuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves into a MILITARY ASSAULT HELICOPTER, its rotors strobing in the fading sunlight.  Drawing closer, the SOUND of powerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes dominant, overpowering. \nGuided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper looms hard INTO VIEW, pitching forward and settling to the ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation \n2-A   INT. COMMAND POST - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)                   2-A  * \nWhere a MAN wearing a military UNIFORM watches through the large open windows the helicopter as it continues to approach.  Before the skids have even touched down he SEES the first of the MEN, dressed in CIVILIAN CLOTHES but carrying full COMBAT GEAR, alight gracefully from the chopper, double-timing in close order to one side, the orders SHOUTED by one man lost in the ROAR of the chopper. \nThe man turns away from the window, to a FIGURE, hidden     * in the shadows. \nMAN                                 * He's here. \nHe turns back, lowering a BAMBOO SHADE, obscuring the       * window. \n2-B   EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT                            2-B  * \nOn adjoining PADS, two other HELICOPTERS are VISIBLE; in the b.g. can be SEEN several concrete and THATCHWORK BUILDINGS, a secret command post disguised as a COASTAL FISHING VILLAGE. \nThe post in a flurry of activity, AMERICAN ADVISORS shouting directions to dozens of LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to load EQUIPMENT into the other choppers. \nInside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against  * the bulkhead, as if asleep.  He stirs, sits up, lighting    * up a CIGAR.  With fatigue showing in his motion, he leans   * forward, descending to the ground.                          * \nA JEEP pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the    * front seat, tossing his GEAR into the rear.  With a         * lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post.          * \nIn the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep approaches.  Reaching the command post the man alights from the jeep, heading towards the two men. \nInto the pool of light cast by the fixture above the door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER, the team leader, 38, an intelligent and intense man.  He informally salutes, GENERAL H.L. PHILIPS, 55, hardened, close-cropped graying hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a member of an elite commando unit in the U.S. Army.  He clasps Schaefer warmly on the shoulder. \nPHILIPS (with affection) You're looking well, Dutch. \nSCHAEFER It's been a long time, General. \nThey walk up the stairs, entering the palapa, leaving the other man on guard. \n3     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                      3 \nLarge, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof. Behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of compact FIELD RADIO EQUIPMENT, MAPS and AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS.  Otherwise the rooms are primitive and stand out in stark contrast to this high-tech invasion. \nPhilips and Schaefer enter the room. \nSCHAEFER Like the old days, Dillon. \n(CONTINUED) \n3     CONTINUED:  (4)                                        3 \nDILLON Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya. \nSchaefer looks at Dillon, quietly considering him. \nSCHAEFER Wasn't my style.  We're a rescue unit, not assassins. (smiles) This must be good.  Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important? \nDILLON Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world.  They're about to get squeezed.  We can't let that happen.  I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet...no screw-ups.  I needed the best. The best.  So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department...and here we are. \nSCHAEFER Go on. \nDillon goes to the map. \nDILLON The set-up is simple, Dutch. One day job.  We pick up their trail at the chopper, run 'em down, grab the hostages and bounce back across the border before anyone knows we were there.  You've done it a hundred times.  Nothing out of the ordinary. \nSchaefer considers this. \n(CONTINUED) \n3     CONTINUED:  (5)                                        3 \nSCHAEFER And nothing we can't handle alone. \nPhilips breaks in. \nPHILIPS I'm afraid those are your orders, Major.  Once you reach your objective, Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge. \nSchaefer looks from Philips to Dillon.  He still doesn't like it. \nDILLON Not to worry, Dutch.  I haven't lost my edge.  They've got a head start on us in some real tough country, otherwise, believe me, it's a piece of cake. \nPHILIPS Gentlemen, we're losing time. (to Schaefer) You'd better get your men ready. (pause) Good luck, Major. \n4     EXT. TWO ASSAULT HELICOPTERS - NIGHT                   4 \nBurst over the top of a ridge.  Rising up in silhouette they perform a radical left bank turn and descend rapidly into an adjoining valley, racing over the jungle at treetop level. \nAs the helicopters perform dizzying, high-speed maneuvers through the winding canyon, the PILOT'S VOICES can be HEARD, coordinating their operations. \nPILOT ONE (voice over) Redbird Two, Two.  Bearing south, three, five, zero, one o'ckock on the saddle ridge. Over. \n(CONTINUED) \n4     CONTINUED:                                             4 \nPILOT TWO (voice over) Roger, Blue Leader.  Three, five, zero, on your move. Over. \nThe helicopters rise in perfect coordination over another ridge and bank sharply into the next valley, leveling out as they go. \n5     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                                5 \nIlluminated by the eerie red glow of NIGHT LIGHTS, are SEVEN MEN, dressed in jungle camouflage, soft hats and camouflage face-makeup.  They wear no identity badges or insignias.  The man are checking their WEAPONS, making last minute adjustments to their GEAR. \nThe compartment reverberates with the NOISE of the THUMPING ROTORS and the ROAR of air from the open doors. \nBLAIN, weapons and ordinance specialist, a frightening bull of a man, a 240 pound killer, removes from his shirtpocket a think PLUG OF TOBACCO.  He looks across at: \nMAC, a huge bear of a man, black, holding am M-60 MACHINE GUN.  Blain holds out the tobacco to Mac who refuses with a gentle shake of the head, a knowing smile, he knows what's coming. \nHolding the plug between his teeth Blain yanks free from his shoulder scabbard a wicked, ten inch COMBAT KNIFE.  Placing the razor sharp blade next to his lips he slices through the plug as if it were butter.  He chews throughtfully. \nSeated by the open doorway is RAMIREZ, a slight, angular man, an East L.A. streetwise Chicano. \nAdding a final piece of camouflage TAPE to his pack HARNESS, he looks up and smiles, faking a throw and the bulleting the tape to: \nHAWKINS, the radioman and medic, Irish, street-tough, reading a rolled-up magazine, as if he were a rush hour commuter.  He snags the tape with an instinctual snap \n(CONTINUED) \nBlain's massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew. He pauses, eyes moving downward, spotting his target. \n(CONTINUED) \n11     CONTINUED:                                            11 \nHe hocks a thick, vile stream of TOBACCO JUICE directly between Dillon's legs and onto the floor, a gelatinous skein lacing across the toe of one boot.  Dillon looks up, his face goes cold and menacing. \nDILLON (icy) Man, that's a real bad habit you've got. \nDillon turns back to Ramirez, ignoring Mac and Blain, who continues to stare at him.  Mac looks across at Blain, wide grins breaking across their huge faces. Cradled in Blain's arms, as if it were a part of his body, is a large, CANVAS-COVERED BUNDLE.  Blain looks down at his bundle, almost affectionately. \nThe PILOT's VOICE breaks in over Schaefer's headset. \nPILOT NUMBER ONE (voice over) LZ comin' up in 30 seconds. Stand by the rappel lines. \nLooking up, Schaefer gives a hand signal to the nearest man who nods and in return,passes the signal down the line. \nRamirez and Blain pick up heavy, METAL CONICAL DEVICES, attached to canvas bags filled with rope. \n12     EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               12 \nFrom the open doors the RAPPELLING LINES hurtle into space, CRASHING through the double canopy of the trees and to the jungle floor below. \n13     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               13    * \nThe blue light changes to GREEN.  Schaefer nods. RAPPELLING DEVICES SNAP into place.  Gloved hands grab onto rope.  Combat boots move into position. \nDILLON (shouting to Schaefer) You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!!  Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!! \n(CONTINUED) \n13     CONTINUED:                                            13 \nSCHAEFER You never were all that smart...let's go!!! \nSchaefer signals.  Men leap from the chopper. \n14     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT                                   14 \nThe man crash through the trees and are swallowed up by the darkness below.  The helicopters depart, THUMPING their way into the night. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n15     EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY (DAWN)                      15 \nA light shower passes through the trees.  The sky clears, REVEALING a lush and exotic foliage.  Birds are beginning to SING but otherwise, all is SILENT. \nThe dense growth seems impenetrable, but from a solid wall of undergrowth, a HAND appears and signals in a downward motion. \nAs if by magic, the assault team materializes, quietly, cautiously.  Schaefer makes another gesture and the team moves forward in perfect harmony in POINT-LOCK step, taking their cue from Ramirez, the pointman.  Schaefer, highly focused and alert to every sound and movement, follows Ramirez, as if organically connected. \n16     EXT. JUNGLE HILLSIDE - DAY                            16 \nDescending the steep mountain slope, the team encounters an even denser growth of jungle, at times moving by instinct, as they are often visually separated.  At one point, Schaefer checks his COMPASS, flashing some hand signals to Ramirez, indicating a new direction.  Ramirez nods and moves on, Schaefer signaling to the rest of the men. \n17     EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY                            17 \nBlain, in a defensive position, sweeps the jungle slowly with his MP-5.  He steps back and turns, checking, revealing in the b.g. the WRECKAGE OF A U.S. ARMY UH-1H HELICOPTER, hanging upside down, twenty feet above the ground, entangled in vines in the heavy capony, badly damaged, rotors bent, its tail section blown away. \n(CONTINUED) \nREVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/21/86                          14 \n17     CONTINUED:                                            17 \nA GRAPPLING HOOK is hurled from the ground, CLATTERING into the cargo hold, hooking the edge of the airframe. \n18     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                 18 \nRamirez moves cautiously, searching for trip wires, using his knife to check the edges of the seats and door frames.  Grimly he glances at the TWO BODIES slumped over the controls and then exits, snapping into and rappelling down the rope to the ground. \nHe joins Schaefer standing in the f.g.  They look up, watching as Dillon moves through the cockpit, searching through pockets and compartments.  Schaefer turns his back to the helicopter. \nDillon at once goes into a defensive position, listening.  The jungle is SILENT.  He stands and starts to move forward.  Suddenly Mac appears within inches of Dillon's face.  Mac's face is menacing, angry. \n(CONTINUED) \n30     CONTINUED:                                            30 \nMAC (hissing; barely audible) You're ghostin' on me, mother fokaaa!...I don't care who you are back in the world... You give away our position again and I'll bleed you quiet and leave your fuckin' ass right here. (hisses; spits) Got it? \nDillon's eyes are wide and fixed, staring back in cold hatred at Mac, controlling his rage...he knows the rules. \nNot waiting for a response, Mac turns and vanished into the jungle.  Seething with anger Dillon focuses on a still moving LEAF and STEM, indicating Mac's exit point.  He moves on. \n31     EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      31 \nCrouches under heavy foliage, waiting.  He is joined by Mac.  They glance briefly at each other, scanning in opposite directions for movement and sounds.  They speak in whispers. \nBLAIN Say, Bull.  What's goin' down? We got movement? \nMAC No.  Shithead with his trenchcoat and dee-coda-da ring was makin' enough noise to get us all waxed.  I don't like that guy.  Don't like him at my back.  I ain't winding up like those bastards back there. \nMac, sweating heavily, wipes the moisture from his brow with his finger. \nBlain pats the mini-gun affectionately. \nBLAIN I know what you mean, Bull, but don't sweat it, me and 'ol 'painless' here are watchin' the front door. \n(CONTINUED) \n31     CONTINUED:                                            31 \nMAC As always, bro... \nThey do a gentle fist dap and smile warmly at each other.  Two men who have seen it all, through a dozen no-win situations, and have lived to tell about it. \nMac advances a few meters and signals slowly. \n32     EXT. KNOLL                                            32 \nThe assault team moving up the hill, barely visible in the heavy foliage, the team moves cautiously into defensive positions.  Holding. A moment later they continue up the hill, crawling. \nOn their stomachs, Schaefer and Ramirez clear the edge of the knoll, SEEING below a GUERRILLA VILLAGE, a huge, spreading PALAPA covering implacements dug into a hillside, descending to a winding stream bed below.  30 MEN, dressed in a mixture of jungle fatigues and civilian clothes, armed with AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES move about the camp.  A heavy MACHINE GUN emplacement guards the entrance to the camp.  TWO MEN sit in the camouflaged emplacement. \n33     SCHAEFER                                              33 \nsweeping the camp with BINOCULARS, SEES a GUARD above the camp.  One of the man picks up a hand-held ROCKET LAUNCHER, placing it beside a bandolier of ROCKETS and a RADIO SET and CONSULS taken from the U.S. surveillance helicopter as if preparing to take them away. \nSchaefer puts down the glasses, looking at Ramirez who nods in acknowledgment.  A sudden MUFFLED CRY brings Schaefer's attention to one end of the camp, where a heavily thatched DOOR covers and opening to the PALAPA.  A GUARD stands at the door. \nThe door flies open as a HOSTAGE, shirtless, hands tied behind his back, staggers through the door as if kicked from behind. \n(CONTINUED) \nREVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/29/86                          24 \n33     CONTINUED                                             33 \nThe man falls to the ground, feebly trying to regain his footing.  Although difficult to see from Schaefer's vantage point, the man's battered face and welt-covered back indicate he has been severely tortured. \nEmerging from the palapa, a GUERRILLA LEADER, moustached and wearing a SIDEARM, approaches the beaten man, kicking him viciously in the stomach, rolling him to his side. \nKneeling beside the man he withdraws an AUTOMATIC from his holster and cocks the hammer.  Grabbing the man by the hair he jams the muzzle into the man's ear and with a violent twist, pulls the trigger. \nThe guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back to the palapa, still holding the pistol, closing the door behind him. \n34    SCHAEFER                                              34 \ngrim-faced at having witnesses the murder, lowers him glasses, a look of cold determination on his face. Quickly he and Ramirez ease down the escarpment, joining the other team members. \nSchaefer makes a circling motion with his thumb and the team members gather in close, huddle formation. \nSCHAEFER (whispering; angry) Just killed one of the                             * prisoners.  No time for                            * invitations.  We take them, now. \n35     EXT. BLAIN AND MAC - DAY                              35 \nWatching as Schaefer pulls the pin and launches the GRENADE into the air, the Observer following its arc as it spirals dead-center into the camp, bouncing twice before rolling into the FUEL DUMP...which a moment later, EXPLODES into an incredible FIREBALL. \nThe expanding FIREBALL released from the explosion is to the Observer like an erupting sun, momentarily blinding him. \n47     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             47 \nThe truck is BLOWN up into the air by the explosion... a moment later the satchel charge DETONATES with an ear-splitting EXPLOSION, tearing the truck apart. \n48     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   48 \nJumps to his feet, FIRING an M-203 round into the camp. \n49     EXT. KNOLL - DAY                                      49 \nSchaefer races down the hillside, joined by Dillon, leaving Hawkins to cover them.  Bullets burst around their feet as they run low, firing short bursts to his left and right. \n(CONTINUED) \n49     CONTINUED:                                            49 \nHe FIRES the undermounted GRENADE LAUNCHER, sending a round into a gun position in the trees.  Still running he breaks open the breach, slamming in another 40mm ROUND from the cartridge pack at his waist. \nBlain and Mac fire the heavy machine guns, laying down a withering curtain of lead, shredding the camp, taking out five Guerrillas at once. \n50     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             50 \nA MAN almost completely ON FIRE is hit by an onslaught of GUNFIRE, ripping him back into the jungle. \nRamirez cuts loose a barrage from the SIX-SHOOTER... seconds later the MACHINE GUN IMPLACEMENT erupts in a series of EXPLOSIONS, blowing two Guerrillas into the air. \nAt the HILLSIDE HUT, two Guerrillas move into position by the window, drawing down on Schaefer as he appears, racing down the hill. \nAs they are about to open fire, Dillon appears, YELLING OUT a warning. \nDILLON On your nine!!! \nSchaefer dives, hitting the ground as Dillon OPENS FIRE taking out the Guerrillas.  Schaefer rolls to his feet, spins, firing the 203 grenade launcher, completely destroying the hut. \n51     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             51 \nAs the Observer regains its vision an eerie, surreal experience of sight and sound unfolds: \nBULLETS streak through the air, leaving blood-red trails of HEAT, like laser blasts.  As they impact into the Guerillas, we HEAR the enhanced SLAPPING of BULLETS, SEEING tiny blossoms of HEAT mushroom out of their bodies. \nWe HEAR the horrific, deformed CRIES and SCREAMS of the dying men. \nAnother searing, blinding EXPLOSION sends pieces of SHRAPNEL ripping through the air, some of them ROARING past the Observer's position, like tiny meteors. \n52     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE                                52    * \nat the entrance way to the main palapa, a Guerrilla stands in the doorway, giving COVER FIRE to his comrades as they fall back inside. \nJumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa, Billy drops directly in front of the Guerrilla. \nFrom the side, unseen by Billy, another Guerrilla           * thrusts out with a knife, Billy ducking backwards, the tip of the knife SLASHING his face.  With a lightning move, Billy whips his arm up and around the Guerrilla, locking his elbow, breaking the joint. \nStill holding the man he FIRES, blowing the other Guerrilla off his feet with the SHOTGUN portion of his weapon.  He looks at the Guerrilla out of the corner of his eye.  He suddenly strikes, breaking his neck, dropping him in a heap. \nBilly continues on, racing down the stairs, firing the M-203. \nMeanwhile, Blain is crouched next to a tree, providing      * cover.  Behind Blain, at the edge of the camp, circling around from below, TWO GUERRILLAS appear and FIRE a grenade round which EXPLODES behind Blain, fragments ripping into the tree next to which Blain is standing, bark and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest, one piece tearing into his upper shoulder.  The hits have no effect on the huge man and with a savage GROWL, he spins, opening fire, raking the two attackers with the Mini-gun. \nNearby, Mac charges from the jungle on a dead run, diving over a fallen tree as machine gun FIRE rakes the ground around him. \nBlain, spotting the sniper high in a tree, opens FIRE with the MINI-GUN, shredding the tree, sending the Guerrilla crashing down through the roof of the palapa. \n53     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53 \nThe sniper CRASHES through the roof, landing on the floor near Hawkins and Ramirez who do a quick double take before opening fire on a group of fleeing Guerrillas, taking out two, giving chase to the others. \n(CONTINUED) \n53     CONTINUED:                                            53 \n53-C   CONTINUED:                                            53-C \nSCHAEFER (closes eyes) Shit... \nHe checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick up her PISTOL, ejecting the clip.  He stands, beginning to shuffle through the PAPERS scattered about the room. Staring at one he looks up, the pieces falling together. \n54     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                     54 \nRamirez, at a crouch, runs through the jungle, following the obvious signs of the Guerrilla's retreat.  He emerges from the trees into an opening, leading to a sheer rock cliff, towering fifty feet above the ground.  Scanning the wall, he SEES movement and quickly takes cover, as automatic FIRE rips up the ground before him. \n54-A   EXT. ROCK WALL - DAY                                  54-A \nNear the center of which a narrow cut, two feet wide, leads to the top of the cliff, giving access to the adjoining ridge. \nTwo Guerrillas scramble up through the chimney, assisted by a ROPE, which with withdraw as they reach the top.  Ramirez takes out one man, the other taking cover, returning fire. \n54-B   EXT. BASE OF ROCK WALL - DAY                          54-B  * \nBlain joins Ramirez, behind cover at the foot of the cliff.  As they take cover, Ramirez notices the wound on Blain's shoulder. \nRAMIREZ You're hit.  You're bleedin', man. \nBlain looks briefly at the wound. \nBLAIN (spits) Ain't got time to bleed. \nOn a signal, they both clear cover and fire LONG BURSTS from their weapons up the cliff. \n(CONTINUED) \n54-B   CONTINUED:                                            54-B \nThe smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered by withering FIRE.  They duck down as a grenade EXPLODES nearby.  Ramirez quickly replaces the 40MM rounds into the SIX-SHOOTER. \nBLAIN Son of a bitch's dug in like a Alabama tick... (spits) ...jack us around all day. \nRAMIREZ Hell, dude, we don't have all day. \nRamirez immediately rolls into the line of fire, BLASTING six RAPID-FIRE shots on a HIGH-ARC trajectory towards the rocks.  Blain reacts. \nBLAIN Shit, Pancho!!! \nBlain dives against the protective cover of the rock wall, covering his head.  Ramirez casually hops across, squatting next to Blain.  They make eye-contact. \nRAMIREZ What's your problem, dude? \nBefore Blain can answer, Ramirez puts his fingers into his ears and grimaces just as... \nThe entire hillside EXPLODES, blowing the Guerrillas into the air, a torrent of vegetation and earth raining down the cliff, obscuring Blain and Ramirez. \n55     INT. PALAPA ROOM - DAY                                55 \nSchaefer is staring out the window, his weapon slack in one arm, still holding the paper.  Dillon enters, obviously excited about what he has found.  He sees the papers on the floor.  He reads through them quickly, growing even more excited. \nDILLON This is beautiful!  More than we ever thought.  We got the bastards! \n(CONTINUED) \nREVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/17/86                          35 \n55     CONTINUED:                                            55 \nSchaefer turns, striding slowly to Dillon, handing him the paper he is holding. \nSCHAEFER I think this is the one you want. \nDillon reads it. \nDILLON (reacting) Two days...that's all we had. In two days, three hundred of these bastards would have been equipped with all this.  After they crossed the border, it would have taken a year to stop them. (looks up) We've averted a major guerrilla invasion, Dutch... \nSchaefer moves in close to Dillon, face to face, anger flaring in his eyes. \nSCHAEFER (slow; deliberate) It was all bullshit.  All of it. From the start...you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work. \nDillon grabs the handset from Hawkin's radio, shoving it at Schaefer. \nDILLON You're still under orders, Dutch.  You want to make the call, or should I? \nSchaefer looks at the handset.  Then at Dillon, he knows Dillon's won. \n(CONTINUED) \n55-A   CONTINUED:  (2)                                       55-A \nHe starts to walk away but stops, turning back, pointing a finger at Dillon. \nSCHAEFER I'm getting my men out of this damn jungle, Dillon.  She's your baggage.  You fall behind, you're on your own. \n56     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE - DAY                          56 \nSchaefer and Billy are kneeling on the ground near the trailhead, studying a MAP.  In the b.g., the team, hidden, covers the hillside approaches to the camp, nervous and wary, weapons ready. \nSCHAEFER This place is too hot for a pick-up. They won't touch us until we're over the border.  We can lift at LZ 49, here. (points to map) Spotter plane says we're cut off. (points to map) Except for this valley. \nBilly shakes his head, following the CONTOUR LINES of the rugged terrain. \nBILLY Looks bad, Major.  It's gonna be a real bitch. (points to map) If we follow above the river and then down, here, at this canyon, we might find a way out. \nSchaefer turns to Ramirez, kneeling close by. \nSCHAEFER (decisively) Not much choice.  Pancho, take the lead.  Double time it. \nHe turns and looks at Dillon, Anna as his side, her forehead bandaged, her hands bound in front of her. He turns back to the others. \nSCHAEFER Lock n' load, watch your ass. \nBlain moves out, swinging the Mini-gun in front of him as he goes. \n56-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. - DAY                          56-A \nWatching as Dillon leads ANNA onward, SEEING her bound hands.  Dillon pushes her. \n57     EXT. ANNA - DAY                                       57 \nSpins, hurling a string of insults to Dillon in SPANISH. \nANNA (in Spanish) You touch me again, pig, and I will cut off your balls! \nDILLON (in Spanish) It's a long walk back, make it easy on yourself. \nShe spits at him, turning forward with a twist of her head. \nDillon picks up his back, shouldering it.  As they move on, Mac calls out to him. \nMAC (quietly) Hey, Dillon, over here. \nDillon doesn't respond. \nMAC (louder) Dillon, over here. \nDillon turns and approaches, warily, holding the girl. \nDILLON Yeah, what is it, Sergeant? \nMAc unsheathes his knife.  He gives Dillon a cold look and turns him by the shoulders.  Crawling across the PACK on Dillon's back is a huge SCORPION. \nMac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his blade, holding it before the wincing Dillon.  Anna smirks, nodding to the writhing, stinging insect. \nANNA (in Spanish) When my people catch you, you'll wish you were him. \n(CONTINUED) \n57     CONTINUED:                                            57 \nDillon looks at Mac. \nDILLON Thanks. \nHave fallen behind, Dillon looking worriedly ahead at the them out distancing them.  Anna is keeping her pace purposefully slow.  She trips on a root falling to the ground.  She lies there, motionless. He quickly reaches down to haul her to her feet. \n(CONTINUED) \nREVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/29/86                          44 \n62     CONTINUED:                                            62 \nDILLON (urgently) Shit.  Come on... \nLike an uncoiled spring, Anna turns, flinging a handful of DIRT into his face, momentarily blinding him.  She lunges for his rifle with her bound hands. \nSuddenly the BARREL of an MP-5 is thrust into her face. \nLooking up she SEES Ramirez, calmly holding the weapon on her, the look in his eyes indicating he'd hove no trouble shooting her. \nRAMIREZ (in Spanish) Don't try it. \nShe looks back at Dillon, wiping the dirt from his eyes. She moves on.  Ramirez gives him a cold look as Dillon hurries past. \nRAMIREZ (coolly) You should put her on a leash, Agent Man.  If you can't handle her, just say the word. \nDillon moves on, ignoring Ramirez, who turns, scanning the jungle behind him before moving on.  Dillon catches up with Anna, turning her sharply by the chin. \nDILLON (cold; in Spanish) Try that again.  Please.                           * \nShe looks at him contemptuously, undaunted.  She will try it again.  She breaks away from his grasp and moves on, Dillon watching her go, he won't hesitate next time. \n63     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            63 \nAs he travels, directly overhead, timing his movement with those of the team.  He moves lower, closer to the slowly moving humans. \n64     EXT. RIVER BED - DAY                                  64 \nThe team moves cautiously through the winding stream bed, now wearing their clothing in various stages of disarray for comfort, sweat dripping from their bodies. \n(CONTINUED) \nREVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/17/86                          45 \n64     CONTINUED:                                            64 \nBilly, in the lead, picks his way along the riverbank, his concentration rapt, aboriginal.  His face a trancelike mask of expectation. \nBlain, cradling the heavy Mini-gun as if it were a toy, swings the weapon relentlessly across his field of view.  He pauses to adjust the hanging, belted loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack magazine.  An INSECT lands on his face and is trapped in the grease paint near his lips.  He draws the hapless bug into his mouth with his tongue and quietly spits it out, his concentration unbroken. \nMac follows, holding the M-60 high across his chest. \nSchaefer, bent, cautious, his feet moving aside the dry leaves on the ground, heel to toe and on foot edges.  He glances around, checking the team's position and progress. \nHawkins follows, his mouth open, breathing deeply, exhausted, the radio a 60 pound demon. \nAnna, struggling to climb a section of the stream bank, slips on some loose dirt.  Unable to assist herself with her hands tied, she nearly falls. Dillon prods her with his rifle, forcing her to her feet.  She scrambles up the bank, Dillon following. \n65     EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY                                 65 \nAs Billy enters a small clearing, bordered on one side by the towering trees, carpeting the mountainside.  High above in the thick, impenetrable treeline, brightly colored birds SQUAWK loudly, chasing each other from branch to branch. \nSuddenly Billy stops.  Schaefer holds up his hand and the team freezes in position.  An eerie SILENCE, like a slowly falling curtain, descends over the jungle until even the BUZZING and CLICKING of insects have CEASED. \n66     EXT. TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                               66 \nSensing an ambush, move quietly into the foliage. Dillon moves into the undergrowth, dragging Anna with him.  He slings his MP-5 over his shoulder, withdrawing his KNIFE.  Grasping Anna by her shirt collar and pushing her to the ground he holds the weapon near her throat.  Dillon signals to Ramirez          * who approaches.  Dillon hands Ramirez the knife. \n(CONTINUED) \nREVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/17/86                          46 \n66     CONTINUED:                                            66 \nDILLON Watch her. \nBefore Ramirez can respond, Dillon slips into the undergrowth.  Ramirez holds the knife on Anna, cautiously scanning around him for movement. \nHEARING Ramirez' cry, Schaefer signals to Hawkins to move.  Hawkins moves out, fast, heading towards the sound... \n77     EXT. HAWKINS - DAY                                    77 \nSEES Anna running away.  He gives chase. Anna, although bound, is light and fit and runs fast, hurdling fallen logs and branches, charging through the undergrowth.  SHe has a good start. \nHawkins, hampered by the radio and weapon but in tremendous shape, thunders after her, closing the distance. \n78     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            78 \nAs he passes from behind a large tree, surrounded by dense foliage, SEEING the fleeing Anna.  He watches her and then begins to move parallel with her, only faster, the green of the jungle rushing by in a blur. \n79     EXT. ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY                           79 \nAnna, bursting through a grove of ferns, drives on, breathing hard with the exertion.

As he steps clear of the foliage he SEES Anna driving hard into the alleyway, running directly towards him.  Twenty yards away, Hawkins, closes in. \n81     BACK TO SCENE/HAWKINS                                 81 \nOnly a few feet behind Anna, lunges forward, knocking her to the ground.  In a second he's on her, his weapon ready.  She struggles to her feet, fighting, gasping for breath.  Hawkins holds the MP-5 on her, looking at her, almost pleading.  He doesn't want to shoot her, but he will if he has to. \nHAWKINS Please... \nShe looks at the weapon, to Hawkins and then, hopefully, to the jungle.  She stops, staring hard down the alleyway.  Something...suddenly she sees it! \nANNA (in Spanish) Look out, behind you!!! \nHawkins spins... \n82     EXT. HAWKINS AND ANNA'S P.O.V. - DAY                  82 \nSEEING the MOTTLED OUTLINE of the Hunter's body, racing towards them, as if the entire wall of the jungle were rushing in.

As he passes Ramirez, Ramirez turns and scans the rear and flanks. \nDillon, Mac and Blain repeat the maneuver, leap-frogging forward, canvassing the jungle, providing areas of intersection cover. \n88     EXT.

He wipes the sweat from his eyes and clicks his safety on the Mini-gun to fire. \nThe SOUND is growing closer.  Blain levels the weapon. A smile crosses his face. \nBLAIN (whispers) Come on in you fuckers...come on in.  'ol 'painless' is waitin'... \nThe movement in the brush is GROWING LOUDER.  Blain's finger moves closer to the trigger. \nSuddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves, startling Blain.  He relaxes momentarily as he watches the animal scurrying from sight.  He stands... \n(CONTINUED) \n92     CONTINUED:                                            92 \nSOMETHING grazes his shoulder, a gout of BLOOD erupting. He starts to turn, the Mini-gun held low, ready to fire... \n...from out of the jungle, 75 feet away, the Hunter's WEAPON streaks toward him like a missile.

In the instant before the Hunter disappears into the forest, Mac SEES a vision so brief and fantastic that it seems like a hallucination. \nThe Hunter's EYES flare momentarily from the green before they vanish. \nMac sees his friend, lying on the ground, his chest open, the powerful man, dead. \nMAC (shouting) Contact, 30 Right!!! \nHe OPENS FIRE with his M-203, belted shells slamming into the weapon from the magazine at his waist, expending it in one LONG BURST. \n94     EXT.

As he stands, the CARTRIDGE BELT, attached to Blain, strings out between them. \nHe opens FIRE and the foliage before him EXPLODES with the fury of the terrible weapon.  Mac sweeps the Mini-gun from left to right, like a man possessed, mowing down the jungle. \nThe other team members race INTO SIGHT and begin firing with Mac. \n(CONTINUED) \nREVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/29/86                          55 \n95     CONTINUED:                                            95 \nRamirez opens FIRE with the SIX-SHOOTER grenade launcher...EXPLOSIONS rock the jungle. \n96     EXT.

Mac, his weapon expended, continues to thrust the Mini-gun forward, still squeezing the trigger. \nSuddenly, as quickly as it started, THE FIRING STOPS. The men move catlike into the jungle, reloading, searching, their nerves taut, stretched to the limit, ready to fire again at any second. \nMac is frozen, eyes wide, unblinking, his breath coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle, still squeezing the trigger of the weapon, its breech locked open, GUNSMOKE wafting from the chamber and barrel. \nSchaefer moves in front of Mac, still staring into the jungle.  Dillon pushes Anna into the clearing, moving towards the body.  Anna looks at the body and then up to Mac.  Schaefer sees a terrifying moment of recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to stare at Mac.  He turns to Mac. \nMAC (confused) I...saw it. \nAt these words, Anna reacts in shock, drawing a             * slight breath.  Schaefer turns, sees her staring at         * Mac.

ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT                              113 \nThe mist has thickened, the night alive with a million JUNGLE SOUNDS.  The team members sleep uneasily, if at all. \nMac, although weary, stares hard into the night, waiting, each small sound a potential enemy.  A LULL spreads over the jungle, animals and insects QUIETING. Mac tightens his grip on the Mini-gun. \nBilly awakens, peering into the night.  Nothing. \nSuddenly, a metallic CLICK, a POP, the SOUND of a warning flare rocketing into the canopy.  A moment later a brilliant FLASH as the flare burns, illuminating the camp. \nAn echoing eerie SCREAM fills the night as a DARK SHAPE in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards Mac. \nMac spins, hauling the heavy gun around, just as something crashes into his upper body, driving the huge man into the foxhole. \nA desperate battle for life ensues, illuminated with the strobing light of the descending flare.  Mac's enraged SHOUTS and ROARS mingled with horrific SCREAMS fill the night. \nMac's razor-edged KNIFE slashes in the light; BLOOD spatters his face as he attacks fiercely. \n(CONTINUED) \n113     CONTINUED:                                           113 \nSchaefer and Ramirez rush at a crouching run towards the foxhole, their weapons ready. \nA tremendous climatic SCREAM from the foxhole AND THEN, SILENCE.  Schaefer and Ramirez approach, cautiously. Mac stands, his face and clothes drenched in blood, some of it his, his breath coming in rapid gasps.  He looks at Schaefer, whispering hoarsely. \nMAC Got the motherfucker... \nAs the flare breaks through the canopy, dying out in great flickering bursts, the man stare down into the foxhole.  A huge, jungle BOAR lies mutilated in a pool of blood, still quivering in the final throes of death. \nThe flare dies out. \nMac, shaking from adrenalin, breathing heavily, looks down at the dying animal. \nMAC (incredulous) A pig...just a fucking pig... \nSchaefer shines his TEKNA-LIGHT onto the boar, playing the light along its massive hulk, its razor edges tusks gleaming in the light.  Ramirez appears by his side, looking down at the huge carcass. \nRAMIREZ Holy shit, Mac. \nNearby, unnoticed by the men, Anna stoops, her hands still bound, picking up an MP-5 from the ground.  She turns, looking for an avenue of escape, running for the jungle. \nBut the forest looks foreboding and sinister.  She stops, staring at the jungle, the moonlight reflected off leaves like a thousand eyes.  For a brief second she imagines she can see the Hunter's eyes, crashing towards her, the shifting patterns of light and dark making the jungle seem to strobe, like it is about to rush in at her.  She freezes, paralyzed by fear, by her memories of the attack. \nShe drops the MP-5 to the ground. \nBack at the foxhole, Schaefer and Ramirez help the still shaken Mac from the hole.  Schaefer looks at Mac, at the huge gash across his chest. \n(CONTINUED) \n113     CONTINUED:  (2)                                      113 \nSCHAEFER Get a field dressing on that right away. \nSuddenly he remembers, Anna. \nSCHAEFER Where's the girl? \nThey all turn, ready to move and then stop.  Coming forth from the shadows Anna appears, still frightened, seeking the security of the soldiers. \nDILLON (derisively) \nShit, you trying to tell me Blain and Hawkins were killed by a fucking lizard?

In a tree at the edge of the clearing, Billy tosses an uncoiling roll of wire to Ramirez who attaches it to a GRENADE, wedged it the crouch of a tree. \nWires attached to GRENADES and CLAYMORE MINES lead off through the underbrush and trees leaving a long, unmined corridor leading from the camp and into the jungle. \nAt the corridor's end, where the rocks merge with the jungle, Schaefer hauls down on a HEAVY VINE, straining with every ounce of strength, his muscles bulging, while Dillon takes up the slack of the vine \n(CONTINUED) \nREVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/29/86                          71 \n115     CONTINUED:                                           115 \naround the base of a tree.  The vine is attached to a forty foot SAPLING, arcing closer to the ground in a gigantic bow with every pull, CREAKING and GROANING with tension.  With a last mighty heave, Schaefer draws the tree almost within reach, gesturing to Dillon to        * tie it off, who does.                                       * \nDILLON (straining) I'm tellin' you, this little                       * 'boy scout' stunt is a                             * Godamned waste of time.                            * (stands)                                    * We've got to get the hell out                      * of here, now, while we've still                    * got the chance. \nIgnoring him, Schaefer rapidly drags into position a NET crudely woven of differing sizes of vines, their LEAVES still attached.  He carefully begins to cover the net with leaves and debris.  Dillon watches him in growing frustration as Schaefer moves quickly, picking up a FRAMEWORK of STICKS he has tied together, a TREADLE-SPRING TRIGGER.  He holds up the framework, hurriedly examining his work before placing it on the ground. \nSCHAEFER He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this. \nThe Hunter utters an unearthly SNARL and HISS from his open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes and he vanishes from sight...a rapid, furtive movement through the trees. \n(CONTINUED) \n118     CONTINUED:                                           118 \nMac OPENS FIRE with the M-60, the others joining in, shredding the foliage, but they know the creature is gone. \nWith a SHOUT, Mac races into the jungle, in pursuit of the Hunter. \nSCHAEFER Mac! \nSchaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the M-203, slamming in a new one.  He shouts an order to Billy. \nSCHAEFER (to Billy) Get Ramirez on his feet!  Take the girl and get the hell out of here! \nHe turns to run after Mac.  Dillon steps in front of him, putting his hand on Schaefer's chest. \nDILLON No way, Dutch.  I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here. \nSCHAEFER This isn't your style, Dillon. \nDILLON Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch.  Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right.  Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along. \nSCHAEFER You know you can't win this one. \nDillon stares at him. \nDILLON You know me, Dutch, I never did know when to quit. \nDillon turns and begins to move out. \n(CONTINUED) \n118     CONTINUED:  (2)                                      118 \nSCHAEFER Dillon! \nDillon turns.  Picking up the spare MP-5, Schaefer tosses the weapon to Dillon, who grabs it with one hand.  They share a look, knowing this is farewell. \nSCHAEFER I'll see you there. \nDILLON Right behind you. \nHefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle after Mac.  Schaefer watches him leave.  He breaks and goes to Ramirez, attended by Anna and Billy, who is now sitting up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath. \nBILLY He's busted up, bad, Major. \nRAMIREZ (gasping) I can make it, Major. \nSchaefer lifts him to his feet, supporting him. \nSCHAEFER Come on, Poncho, we're getting out of here.

MAC - DAY                                       119 \nCreeping low to the ground, his eyes searching through the trees. \nMAC (whispered) Come on, you motherfucker! \n120     EXT. DILLON - DAY                                    120 \nMoving through the underbrush HEARS a slight RUSTLING in the foliage.  Mac?  He strains to locate the source of the movement. \nHe HEARS A SOUND, too faint at first it identify.  He listens.  Silence.  He hears is again, the SOUND of a VOICE, barely audible.  A VERY QUIET WHISPER. \n(CONTINUED) \n120     CONTINUED:                                           120 \nVOICE (o.s.) Dillon, over here. \nDillon locates the direction of the voice and moves towards it. \nHe hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees, impacting crosschest on a large BRANCH, knocking his wind out. \nSemi-conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides off, fingers digging into the bark, falling another ten feet into the swiftly moving river. \n150     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     150 \nWeighted down by his boots and clothing, Schaefer struggles to stay afloat.  Gasping for air he ducks underwater, untying one of his boots.  He surfaces, fills his lungs and dives again, releasing the other boot.  He surfaces, strips off his shirt and pants and begins to swim towards shore, stroking with one arm. \n151     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           151 \nAs he nears the edge of the precipice from which Schaefer has fallen.  The Hunter in close pursuit does not hesitate but LAUNCHES himself off the cliff in a spectacular LEAP, streaking downward towards the tops of the trees that grow out from the canyon wall. \nThe Hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree, the branches and leaves rushing past in a KALEIDOSCOPIC BLUR. \nThe Hunter bounds off of one branch after another, moving through the trees as an expert skier might negotiate a series of downhill gates. \nThe Hunter leaps free of one tree, bounds across twenty feet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree, affording a good view of the river below.  From his vantage point, looking down at the windening, slowing expanse of river, Schaefer is nowhere to be seen. \n152     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  152 \nHe is swept into a still FASTER CURRENT and is carried helplessly downstream.  Boiling WHITEWATER appears. \n(CONTINUED) \n152     CONTINUED:                                           152 \nOut of control he is swept through a series of rapids, pulling his further and further downstream until he is finally ducked into the undertow and hurled over the top of a six foot falls, driven deep underwater by the pounding force of the water. \n153     EXT. POOL AT BASE OF FALLS - DAY                     153 \nThere is no sign of Schaefer.  Precious seconds pass. Slowly, looking like a drowned rat, he surfaces, taking a feeble breath.  He is nearly finished, his energy sapped.  But the water is calm and a few strokes are enough to carry him near the shore.  His feet hit bottom. \nHe tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick MUD SLURRY at the river bank.  With his last ounce of strength, he crawls, panting and gasping into a sheltered mud OVERHANG, collapsing beside the exposed ROOT-SYSTEM OF A DEAD TREE, his body completely covered in thick, gray MUD. \nNearly unconscious, he raises his head and looks to the opposite side of the river, scanning the bank.  There is no sign of the Hunter.  He collapses in relief.  He's escaped. \nSuddenly, the Hunter impacts the water, throwing up a huge SPLASH.  He stands up in the waist deep water.  As the water streams off of his body, the chameleon effect rapidly changes, struggling to match the shifting color patterns of the shimmering water. \nHis glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where Schaefer lies helplessly trapped. \nThe Hunter surges forward, relentlessly closing in on this prey. \n154     SCHAEFER                                             154 \nis frozen in terror, paralyzed with fear, his eyes locked ontothe incredible creature that is about to kill him. \n155     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                    155 \nClosing rapidly, another ten feet.  He leaves the water and walks through the mud, stopping, towering over Schaefer. \n156     EXT. SCHAEFER'S P.O.V. - DAY                         156 \nAs the Hunter's feet surge though the mud and stop, three feet away. \n157     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  157 \nRealizing his life is about to end, closes his eyes, awaiting the Hunter's killing blow. \n158     EXT. HUNTER'S EYES - DAY                             158 \nThe fierce yellow orbs look downward. \n159     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           159 \nHe's looking directly at Schaefer, EXCEPT HE CAN'T SEE HIM. \nHe can clearly see the EXPOSED ROOT-SYSTEM, but because of the heavy mud blocking Schaefer's body heat, Schaefer registers in the Hunter's vision as merely an indistinct lump of clay, unrecognizable to the Hunter as a human being. \nHe scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources. \nDetecting none he moves on sounding a questioning TRILL several times. \n160     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               160 \nHolding his weapons in one hand, he moves up the canyon, ascending into a rising boulder field. \n167-A   EXT. BOULDER FIELD - NIGHT                           167-A \nWhere the river flows into a series of falls and pools, surrounded by massive boulders and table top rocks, their crevices jammed with large amounts of DRIFTWOOD swept down at high water from the forests above. \nOn a flattened section of rock, Schaefer drags a large section of BRANCHES INTO VIEW, adding it to a growing mound of FIREWOOD.  He kneels, tending to a pile of DRIES GRASS, LEAVES and other tinder.  Using the last of his precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, gently coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE, flames starting to lick upward through the dry wood. \nHe stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze.  He turns, facing the canyon rim, raising his weapons in one hand.  From the depths of his soul, a SOUND emerges; primitive and visceral, as if from an animal in pain. \nHe throws back his head and SHOUTS. \n168     EXT. CANYON RIM - NIGHT                              168 \nA hundred feet below, Schaefer stands in the boulder field, his mud coated body bathed in RED FIRELIGHT, looking like a fierce, primitive warrior; a timeless, prehistoric sight, his long and WAILING CRY, ECHOING endlessly through the canyon. \n169     EXT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           169 \nBacklit by the LIGHT of the open door, the Hunter's head, in three-quarter profile, his eyes gleaming, rears INTO VIEW, looking up at the sky, HEARING Schaefer's cry. \n(CONTINUED) \n169     CONTINUED:                                           169 \nResponding with a low HISS, he turns back, raising in one hand his weapon, in the other a U-shaped SHARPENING DEVICE.  As he passes the weapon through the device, it FLASHES into life, a deep, HARMONIC HUM emitted as the blade grows with energy, growing hotter, hotter and HOTTER with each stroke.  He draws the blade now WHITE-HOT through the device for the last stroke.  He lifts it, testing its balance, the WHITE-HOT blade illuminating his alien face. \n170-                                                 OUT     170- \n178     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - JUNGLE - NIGHT                178 \nEmerging from his camp, the Hunter swings into the nearby tree line, moving to the uppermost branches. The Hunter travels silently from tree to tree, arriving at the canyon rim where far below he SEES in the canyon, the BONFIRE, a leaping, shifting, multi-colored collage of HEAT WAVES and FLARES, luring him onward. \n179     SCHAEFER                                             179 \nhidden back within the deep notch of several large LOGS and broken trees, in the river canyon.  Below him, on the rock plateau, is the bonfire, illuminating in SHIFTING PATTERNS of LIGHT, the awaiting arena of destiny. \nHis eyes shift, trancelike, moving from side to side, watching the approaches to the fire below.  His senses are alert; his nerves on a wire edge. \n180     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  180 \nHis SHADOW-FORM descending through the canyon, a rippling movement of grays and blacks, passing through the shifting light patterns on the rocks, cast by the growing bonfire below. \n181     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         181 \nHis eyes probe the canyon, drawn to the swirling patterns of HEAT given off by the gaseous COMBUSTION of the bonfire. \n182     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  182 \nContinues on, moving silently down through the canyon. \n183     SCHAEFER                                             183 \nsits motionless, nearly invisible in his mud camouflage amid the darkness of the logs. \nSuddenly, over the CRACKLING of the FIRE, the BUZZING, CLICKING of INSECTS, and the CROAKING of FROGS, suddenly CEASES. \nSlowly, painfully he draws the bow to full arch, his wounded shoulder trembling, the BLOOD beginning to seep through the bandage. \nThe bow straining at full draw, Schaefer stares intently, concentrating, searching for the Hunter's form in the dancing light below. \n183-A   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-A \nLike a giant insect, drops from above, fifteen feet above Schaefer, his steel-like spurs digging deep into the log. \n183-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-B \nHe freezes at the sound of the Hunter dropping, his eyes wide with fear.  The slightest movement will bring an instant attack from the Hunter behind him.  But to wait, his back exposed. \n183-C   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-C \nJumps from the log above and to Schaefer's left, onto a boulder, gaining a better vantage point of the arena and fire below.  He raises his weapon, his EYES glistening in the dim light, searching.  A quiet HISS emerges from his mouth. \n183-D   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-D \n204     SCHAEFER                                             204 \npauses before the opening of the passageway.  All is silent.  He hesitates to enter.  Listeneing.  He starts to move and then hears a NEW VOICE: \nHUNTER (o.s.; Mac's voice) Dillon, over here... \nSchaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's voice, backs quickly into the space between a boulder and the high rock wall of the ampitheater. \n205     INT. HUNTER - SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT      205 \nHis feet moving quietly over the rock, the shadow-light deepening with the dying fire above, closing in. \n205-A   EXT.

With painstaking care he removes the grenade from his neck. \nFocusing on the rocks before him and the still approaching SOUND, he reaches down with the grenade, gripping with his fingertips the matchhead fuse, placing it against the rocks at his side. \nWith a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws the grenade, snatching up the bang-stick with his good hand. \n(CONTINUED) \n205-A   CONTINUED:                                           205-A \nThe matchhead SPUTTERS as the grenade flies through the air, an instant later a blinding, WHITE FLASH of light illuminates the ampitheater... \nIn that instant Schaefer SEES above him and to his left, the HUNTER, poised on top of a rock, his weapon raised, about to strike!  Momentarily blinded by the flash of light, the Hunter's head recoils to the side. \nDarkness swallows the image of the Hunter, but in that second, Schaefer seizes his advantage, hurling the bang-stick spear. \n206-                                                 OUT     206- \n214     INT.

The Hunter leaps as the grenade DETONATES, shrapnel tearing into his body. \nWith a terrifying SCREAM of pain and anger, the Hunter clutches frantically at the WOUNDS in his neck and chest.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM OF RAGE and the Hunter is gone. \n215     INT. WATERFALL - NIGHT                               215 \nCascades over the rocks, fed by a small stream running through the ravine.  A pile of BOULDERS breaks the falls, filling the area with an everconstant MIST. \nSchaefer appears, holding the bow and arrow, following the LUMINOUS BLOOD TRAIL of the Hunter over the rock. \nMoving behind the falls, Schaefer's body is briefly soaked by the water, the hardened and CAMOUFLAGE beginning to dissolve, running off his body.  He continues on, slowly, cautiously following the blood trail. \n216     INT.

The blood trail stops. \nHe takes another step forward, past a darkened ALCOVE... \nSchaefer spins, SEEING in the alcove the SURPRISED Hunter whirl and spring towards him... \nSchaefer in a bound closes the distance, savagely kicking the Hunter's arm.  The WEAPON flies from the Hunter's hand CLATTERING to the rock. \nBefore he can recover, Schaefer follows with a karate kick to the chest, hurling the Hunter to the ground, his back exposed. \nIn a flash, Schaefer is standing over the Hunter, the bow drawn, poised, the blood from his open wound dripping onto the Hunter's back. \nHe approaches it, wide-eyed, his senses reeling with astonishment and rage. \nFrom within the force field, a PASSAGE WAY of BLUE LIGHT appears, the Hunter's form backlit as he ascends the RAMP to his spacecraft. \n225-                                                 OUT     225- \n227     THE HUNTER                                           227 \nas he passes his hand through a light BEAM, the ship instantly responds, as a low, TURBINELIKE HOWL is HEARD, building slowly in volume and pitch. \n228     SCHAEFER                                             228 \nin his weakened condition staggers forward, looking up, SEEING the passage way of light diminish as the door begins to close. \nAs rising HEAT WAVES begin to envelope the ship, the Hunter stares out at Schaefer, the heat waves increasing as the KEENING WHINE of the ship's drive builds.  He enters the force field, the door now inches from closing. \nOn the ground, nearly obscured by the grass and leaves, Schaefer SEES the Hunter's WEAPON, lying where he dropped it in his desperate flight to escape. \n(CONTINUED) \n228     CONTINUED:                                           228 \nSchaefer grabs up the weapon and holds it.

Nothing happens. \nWith the last ounce of his strength, and with a BELLOW of RAGE, his arm muscles bulging, he crushes down on the handle... \nIn a FLASH of blue-white light, the weapon becomes ACTIVATED. \nSchaefer raises the weapon, sensing its power and function. \nIn the final seconds before the door closes, Schaefer, with a triumphant SCREAM, fires the weapon... \nThe weapon, flaring with deadly energy, drops and turns sideways, accelerating through the door and into the spacecraft. \n229     INT.

DENSE UNDERGROWTH - DAY                          26 \nThe hillside of a steep valley, dark and foreboding. Billy passes by and halts, removing his KNIFE.  With his other hand he pulls down from overhead a THICK VINE, severing it.  A thin stream of WATER emerges which he drinks. \nSuddenly he stops, letting the water drip to the ground.  He quietly releases the vine and brings his M-203 shotgun to bear, listening intently.  Something seems wrong.  He brings his eyes upward and stares, hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside. \nAs his eyes strain to penetrate the dense, intertwined canopy, he is engulfed by the rising SOUNDS of the JUNGLE, a cacophony of BUZZING and CLICKING, amplified in the sweltering heat of the day.  Unable to locate a source to account for his anxiety, he relaxes, moving on, resuming the track. \n27     BILLY (MINUTES LATER)                                 27 \nexamines the ground as he moves, growing confused and puzzled by what he sees before him.  He stops, scrutinizing the jungle, probing the world around him with his keen senses. \nHEARING a faint RUSTLING SOUND he looks up, SEEING a curtain of MOSS several feet away.  He takes a cautious step forward, extending his weapon.  He reaches forward with his free hand, touching the moss. \nBehind the curtain a slight shifting of DARK FORMS occurs.  He pauses and then with a sudden movement, sweeps the moss aside... \nA BLACK EXPLOSION of FLUTTERING WINGS as carrion-eating BIRDS rush past Billy's body. \n(CONTINUED) \n27     CONTINUED:                                            27 \nBilly's face seizes into a mask of horror, his expression descending into a state of complete, primitive shock, his eyes staring transfixed, inches away from the leering death-grin of a HUMAN FACE, upside down, completely stripped of skin. \nReeling, his body numbed by the sight before him, he stumbles backwards and stops. \nVines threaded through their achilles tendons, the BODIES OF THREE MEN, skinned and gutted, hang suspended in the think, suffocating air, BUZZING with insects. \nBilly turns away, revulsed as Ramirez moves quietly INTO VIEW, Schaefer directly behind him.  Ramirez stares at the bodies, now seen to be in the first stages of deterioration, strips of flesh torn away by the birds and other scavengers.  In an almost childlike manner, he crosses himself. \nRAMIREZ (hoarse whisper) Holy Mother... \nSchaefer moves into the clearing, kneeling beside a bloody pile of CLOTHING and ENTRAILS.  He examines the clothing and then rises, holding a DOG TAG on a broken chain.  He reads the tag, his face growing hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag, recognizing the name. \nSCHAEFER (to himself) J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army... \nSchaefer's eyes move from the bloody dog tag to the bodies. \nSCHAEFER (coldly) Mac.  Cut them down. \nMac moves forward, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE. The blade flashes, cutting the vine as the first body THUDS to the ground.  He bends over, picking up other DOG TAGS. \nSchaefer turns to Dillon. \n", "test1_true": "REVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/19/86                          19 \n27     CONTINUED:  (2)                                       27 \nSCHAEFER I knew this man.

Mac steps out of the clearing, sheathing his knife with a violent gesture, passing Ramirez. \nRAMIREZ (seething) Must have run into the guerrillas ...Fucking animals. \nMac moves alongside Blain. \nMAC (spits) Ain't no way for a soldier to die.

Just doesn't make sense. \nSCHAEFER What about the rest of Hopper's men? \nBilly shakes his head. \nBILLY (uncomfortably) No sign.  They never left here Major.

He looks up at Mac, his eyes cold, his face taut with anger. \nBLAIN Payback time. \nBlain hefts the Mini-gun to his hip as Mac draws back slightly on the breech bolt of the M-60, letting it snap. \nThey move on, Billy pausing to look at the jungle before disappearing into the foliage. \nREVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/20/86                          21 \n29     EXT.

He moves on, his huge body barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy undergrowth. \nDillon appears.  As he moves on, he crosses over a fallen TREE.  Stepping down, his foot breaks through a rotten portion, a CHUCK of the log breaking free and rolling down the hill. \n", "test2_input": "MAC We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside.

It's never easy.  He was a good soldier. \nMAC (hardened) The best friend I ever had. \nMac turns and walks through the camp, stopping beside a DARK OBJECT on the ground.

They talk quietly in Spanish, Dillon watching, listening carefully.  Ramirez turns back to Dillon. \nRAMIREZ (interpreting) She says the same thing... It was the jungle... \nRamirez looks up at Billy who continues to stare into the jungle, aware, catlike, reacting to every sound, his nerves on edge, as if ready to snap.

Dillon looks after him and then into the blackness of the jungle canopy.  Dillon speaks to Ramirez. \nDILLON He's losing his cool.  There's nothing out there but a couple of men that we're going to have to take down. \nDespite his words, there is an edge of doubt in his voice.  Schaefer returns.  He's overheard this exchange.

In the chamber is Hawkins' SKULL CAP and SPINAL COLUMN still attached. \nThe light field suddenly changes as all connective tissue, flesh and blood and drawn away from the bony structures with incredible force, disintegrating as they rush toward the sides of the chamber. \nThe light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the Hunter's hands remove the GLAZED, POLISHED trophy from the chamber.  He turns, carefully placing it upon a GLOWING SURFACE.  He touches the trophy gently, feeling its texture, as a man might touch the hide of a big cat.

He looks from one side of the corridor to the other.  Something it out there.  Where? \nSomething in the vines has caught his attention.  He stares hard at a section of moss. \n134     EXT.

He shrugs off the radio letting it fall, smashing into the rocks below. \nHe casts away his weapon.  Staring forward he reaches into his cargo pocket, withdrawing a small GREASE-PAINT TIN.  Covering his finger in BLACK PAINT he applies dark slashes under his eyes and again, vertically down his cheeks.  Taking another dap of paint he makes a SYMBOL on his bare skin, over his heart. \nHe drops the tin, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.  Holding the knife he grasps the MEDICINE BAG around his neck, yanking it free with a quick snap.  He wraps the leather thong around his hand and knife, binding the weapon and bag together. \nStaring outward, as if in a trance, he begins a low CHANT. \nOn the other side, Schaefer carrying Ramirez on his back, laboring up the steep slope, nearing the top, turns and SEES Billy standing, waiting at the foot of the bridge. \nSCHAEFER (screaming) Billy!!! \nBut Billy stands at the foot of the bridge, knife raised, waiting, accepting his oncoming destiny. \nSCHAEFER Billy!!! \n", "test3_true": "REVISED - \"HUNTER\" - 4/17/86                          81 \n140     CONTINUED:                                           140 \nIn frustration, Schaefer hikes Ramirez higher onto his back, digs in and sprints to the top of the hill, Anna waiting at the top. \n141                                                  OUT     141 \n142     EXT.

Together they back up, covering the ridgeline over which they've just come. \nSuddenly, from one side, near Ramirez, the Hunter bursts from the jungle, Ramirez, seeing the Hunter, spins raising his weapons to fire... \nRamirez SEES the Hunter's onrushing face, still in camouflage, a montage of organic textures and colors, his yellow eyes burning. \nWhipping the MP-5 is the direction of the Hunter he is hurled backwards from the impact of the Hunter's weapon, his neck gushing BLOOD, the MP-5 flying through the air, landing in front of Anna.  She moves for the weapon... \nThe Hunter, with unearthly speed, turns towards Anna, as Schaefer starts to spin, SEEING the Hunter about to strike as Anna dives for the weapon.

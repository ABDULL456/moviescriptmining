Typical atmosphere, as before. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
85. MEDIUM SHOT 
Featuring Stew at his desk, which is directly in front of the battery of Morkrums whose clatter comes into the sound track. 
Stew finishes up a phone call. He sits at his desk, staring pensively at his typewriter. He is smoking a pipe and is in his shirt-sleeves. His hair is rumpled, and strewn over the desk is a bunch of crumpled up pieces of paper, indicating that he has made numerous unsuccessful starts at writing something. A fresh blank sheet of paper is now in the typewriter. 
Nearby, at another desk, asleep in a swivel chair, with his feet elevated to the desk, the low snoring of another reporter blends with the sounds of the Morkrums and other noises of the City Room. At the reporter's elbow is a telephone. 
86. MEDIUM SHOT 
Desk of Conroy, the City Editor. A small upright plate on his desk indicates his position. This is near the copy desk. Characteristic activities are background for any action that may take place. Reporters come up to throw their stories on Conroy's desk; the phone rings, etc. 
A boy comes in with a large number of newspapers under his arm which he throws on Conroy's desk. There are several copies of each of the rival newspapers in town. Conroy spreads them out and begins to examine them. 
87. CLOSE SHOT - STEW 
It is evident that he is nervous and jumpy about something. Finally he starts to pound the typewriter. 
INSERT: Sheet of paper in typewriter on which is being typed.

SCENE 1 
A STREET IN ARABY 
88. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER 
As she talks on the phone to one of her girlfriends 
GALLAGHER 
(sotto voce) 
Sure I got a new dress. A new hat too. (listens) Well, I'll try to get Stew to come with me. (she glances in his direction) Yeah - he's all right. You know, he thinks he's stuck on some society gal. (listens) Naw, it won't last. It better not last! 
89. CLOSER SHOT - CONROY 
Hastily glancing over the headlines of the papers. The phone rings. Without looking at it, Conroy answers: 
CONROY 
What? Oh, I'll be surprised, eh? Listen if there's any news in that sheet that I haven't thrown in the wastepaper basket, I'll eat it. 
He is looking down at the papers and suddenly his eyes focus on something which causes the cigar to drop from his mouth and an expression of mingled amazement and rage comes into his face. We do not see at this point what it is he has read, but we know it must be something sensational. Abruptly he hangs up the phone. 
CUT TO: 
CONTINUATION SCENE 87 
Stew, as he studies his typewriter. Over his CLOSEUP comes the excited outraged voice of Conroy. 
CONROY'S VOICE 
Hey Stew! Stew Smith! 
A look of infinite weariness and disgust comes over Stew's face and he grits his teeth. 
STEW 
Me? 
His general expression registers "Good god, there he goes again." With one finger he pounds out four letters: 
INSERT: Sheet in typewriter: Next to 
A STREET IN ARABY 
Stew has typed: 
NUTS 
He yanks the sheet out of the typewriter. 
CONTINUATION SCENE 89 
Conroy. He looks over and bellows furiously. 
CONROY 
You double-crossing hound! Come over here! 
CONTINUATION SCENE 87 
Stew gets up from his machine, crumples the sheet of paper into a wad and flings it at the sleeping reporter. The wad strikes him in the face; he wakes abruptly and automatically reaches for the phone. He picks up the receiver and in a voice fogged with sleep calls a number. Stew exits. 
90. MEDIUM SHOT 
At Conroy's desk. Conroy's expression is one of bitter reproach as he leans back in his swivel chair as Stew approaches and stands by the desk. 
STEW 
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account 
CONROY 
(interrupting fiercely) 
Do you call yourself a reporter? 
91. MEDIUM SHOT 
Of other reporters, the older man at the copy desk, and perhaps a sob sister or two nearby, who look up with expectant interest, expecting to hear Stew get a bawling out. 
92. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER 
At her desk. She looks up worried and apprehensive. 
CONTINUATION SCENE 90 
Stew and Conroy. 
STEW 
It has been alleged - yes 
CONROY 
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped! 
STEW 
(defensively) 
Not on my own beat, no. 
CONROY 
(howling so that he can be heard all over the room) 
No? Well, where were you when that happened? 
He slaps the copy of the Tribune furiously and shoves it into Stew's face. 
93. CLOSE SHOT - STEW 
Not knowing what it is all about, Stew, with an injured expression, takes the paper and looks at it.

(with subheads giving more explicit information) 
94. MEDIUM SHOT 
The other reporters, copy readers, sob sisters, etc., seeing the unusual commotion and Stew's bewildered reaction, get out of their chairs and cross over to the City Desk, where they take up other copies of the same paper to look at. There are amazed and excited exclamations. 
95. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND CONROY 
Stew, still staring dumbly at the paper. A few others are crowding around, glancing over his shoulder, etc.

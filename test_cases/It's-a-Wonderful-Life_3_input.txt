FREDDIE'S VOICE ...but I couldn't find out. Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was because they'd be scared. They know... 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP 
Mary and Freddie. Marty comes into scene, followed by George. 
FREDDIE ...what kind of... 
MARTY (interrupting) You remember George? This is Mary. Well, I'll be seeing you. 
GEORGE Well... Well... Well... 
FREDDIE Now, to get back to my story, see... 
Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start dancing. 
FREDDIE Hey, this is my dance! 
GEORGE Oh, why don't you stop annoying people? 
FREDDIE Well, I'm sorry. Hey! 
MOVING SHOT 
Following George and Mary as they dance. 
GEORGE Well, hello. 
MARY Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me. 
GEORGE Well, I don't. 
MARY You've passed me on the street almost every day. 
GEORGE Me? 
MARY Uh-huh. 
GEORGE Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you. 
A WHISTLE is heard offscreen, and the MUSIC stops. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Harry on the orchestra platform, whistle in hand. 
HARRY Oyez  oyez  oyez... The big Charleston contest. The prize? A genuine loving cup.  Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor. Let's go! 
CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY 
As the MUSIC starts and couples begin dancing once more, they look at each other. 
GEORGE I'm not very good at this. 
MARY Neither am I. 
GEORGE Okay  what can we lose? 
They start their Charleston. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad. 
CLOSEUP  FREDDIE 
Leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking daggers at George. Mickey, a young punk who has had one too many, is beside him. 
MICKEY What's the matter, Othello  jealous? Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor? And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up?  And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack?  And I've got the key? 
Freddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool.  George and Mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. Spotlights concentrate on them. They mistake the screams for cheers. 
CLOSE SHOT 
George and Mary dancing. 
GEORGE They're cheering us. We must be good. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
The crowd watching George and Mary dancing. They move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below. 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
George and Mary still trying to dance in the water  the crowd on the edge cheering them  some of the crowd leap into the pool  the principal trying to restore order, finally clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN: 
EXT. TREE-LINED RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
George and Mary. The night is warm with a bright moon. George is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bath robe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera we hear them singing: 
GEORGE AND MARY (singing) Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight.  Can't you come out tonight. Can't you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon. 
GEORGE Hot dog! Just like an organ. 
MARY Beautiful. 
CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street. 
GEORGE And I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death. You should have seen the commotion in that locker room. I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here. Here, let me hold that old wet dress of yours. 
He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look at each other. 
MARY Do I look as funny as you do? 
GEORGE I guess I'm not quite the football type.  You... look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town. 
MARY Well, why don't you say it? 
GEORGE I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway? 
MARY Eighteen. 
GEORGE Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen. 
MARY Too young or too old? 
GEORGE Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you.  Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on. 
Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly on: 
GEORGE I mean, without a dress. You look older...  I mean, younger. You look just... 
In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's bath robe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers the robe around her. 
GEORGE Oh-oh... 
MARY (holding out her hand) Sir, my train, please.

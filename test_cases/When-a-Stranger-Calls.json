{"test1_input": "JILL Hello? \nPause. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) It's me. \nJILL I know. Who are you? \nPause. No answer. \nJILL I won't be here much longer. The doctor and his wife are coming home soon. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) I know. \nJILL Can you see me? \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Yes. \nJILL (turning toward the window) I'm sorry I turned the lights down. It didn't work anyway. I can turn them back up if you like -- \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Don't. \nJILL Don't? (beat) You've really scared me. Is that what you wanted? (beat) Is that what you wanted? \nDUNCAN (O.S.) No. \nJILL What do you want? \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Your blood... all over me. \nPause. Jill is terrified. \nJILL You don't know me. You don't know who I am or where I live. I'll get Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him or the police. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) You've called the police? \nPause. Jill searches for some way of answering him. \nJILL I want to talk to you. \nThe line goes dead. Jill hangs up. She stands. She starts to shake. \nThe phone rings and Jill snatches it up. \nJILL Leave me alone! \nSACKER (O.S.) Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker! Listen to me! (beat) We've traced the call. It's coming from within the house. A squad car's on its way over there now... just get out of that house! \nJill hangs up. She stands frozen in shock. Several seconds go by. She doesn't move. \nThen the phone rings. She turns and tiptoes toward the front door. Halfway there, the phone stops ringing. She pauses for a second, then continues. \nINT. FRONT HALL \nJill reaches the front door. Carefully, quietly, she turns the bolt. Then O.S. she hears a creak. She turns and looks up the staircase. At the top, a door is opening. Someone is coming out! A mumbling sound is heard on the sound track. \nJill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it. It opens, but only an inch. The chain is still across it! She frantically works to get the chain free. After agonizing seconds, the chain falls clear and the door swings open. \nStanding there on the other side of the door, is a police Detective, JOHN CLIFFORD. (We have cut ahead in time some twenty or thirty minutes.) Behind him on the street, several patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb, their domelights silently flashing. \nCLIFFORD Are the parents here yet? \nCOP'S VOICE (O.S.) Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes ago. \nCLIFFORD Christ! (beat) What a homecoming! \nCOP'S VOICE (O.S.) They wanted to talk to someone. I asked them to wait until you got here. Come on in. \nClifford sighs and steps into the front hall. The door is closed by the uniformed COP with whom Clifford has been speaking. The cop is a man in his thirties. His name is CHARLES GARBER. Garber and Clifford stand in the front hall and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move around them. In the living room beyond can be seen several other POLICEMEN, Dr. Mandrakis and his wife. \nGARBER We were only a block away when the call went out. When we got here, the guy was still waiting upstairs in the children's bedroom. He was covered with blood. \nCLIFFORD Blood? \n", "test1_true": "CLIFFORD Jesus... \nGARBER He'd been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected. \nCLIFFORD Who is he? \nGARBER We found a Merchant Seaman's card on him. He's English. Entered the country less than a week ago. \nCLIFFORD How about the babysitter? \nGARBER She's going to be all right. \nAs Garber delivers his final line, we see ambulance attendants dressed in white, taking a sheet-covered stretcher out the front door. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. STREET - LATER AFTERNOON \nAn upper-class neighborhood. The CAMERA is facing down the street. A car approaches the intersection at the end of the block, turns and comes slowly up the street. \nBecause it is not a new car or an expensive car, and because it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole male occupant is looking for house numbers, we can assume that the DRIVER is a visitor to this neighborhood. \nThe CAMERA PANS with the car ninety degrees as it turns into the semi-circular driveway of a mansion and rolls up to the front door. \nA TITLE appears across the bottom of the screen: \n4:30 pm Thursday, April 20, 1978 \nAs the TITLE FADES, the driver shuts off the car engine and opens the door to get out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANSION - DAY \nThe doorbell rings. A HOUSEBOY comes into the front hall, goes to the door and opens it for the visitor. It is John Clifford, the detective from six years ago. \nHe has aged noticeably over the years. His hair is grayer, his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe occupation. \nNo words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford across the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. Still keen in his observation of things, Clifford quickly takes in this new atmosphere. \nThe house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme of melancholy. There are no bright or cheerful furnishings, and the houseboy advances with guarded tread, his face steady and reverent. \nThe houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase and raps lightly on it with his knuckles. Without waiting for an answer, he opens the door and steps aside for Clifford to enter. \nClifford pauses briefly, then walks into what appears to be an upstairs study. \nINT. STUDY - DAY \nA MAN is sitting behind a desk which faces the door. Presumably he is the master of the house. Although his face is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is engaged in writing something down. \nClifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat in front of it. Then, vaguely in keeping with the spirit of the house, he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt the pervasive stillness. \nAfter a moment, the master of the house lays down his pen and leans back in his chair. Pause. \nMASTER So you're in business for yourself now. \nCLIFFORD (quietly) Yes, sir, for the past three and a half years. \nMASTER That's good. (beat) And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's escape? \nCLIFFORD Oh, yes. \nMASTER Do you think the police will... find him? \nPause. \nCLIFFORD I know they haven't assigned anyone to it specifically. It's an old case. \nMASTER (a tinge of bitterness) An old case. (beat) Can you find him? \n", "test1_id": 951, "test2_input": "HANK C'mon in and shut the door. \nThe intruder enters, indecisively. The door swings shut behind him, plunging the room back into darkness. This man is \"a little weird\", and the regulars continue to stare at him until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits down. Then everyone returns to his own thoughts. \nHANK (after a moment) What'll it be? (pause, no answer) Hey! What'll it be? \nCLOSEUP - INTRUDER \nA bit startled, a bit defensive toward the directness of this question. It is Curt Duncan. He looks understandably harried. He hasn't slept or shaved in at least a couple of days, and is wearing regular clothing. \nHe clears his throat to answer... \nCLIFFORD (O.S.) What kind of clothes was he wearing... when he escaped? \nCUT TO: \nINT. DR. MONK'S OFFICE -DAY \nClifford is looking through the folder again. \nDR. MONK Ordinary street clothes. Not all of our patients have to wear the green Gucci gowns. \nCLIFFORD Did he have any money with him? \nDR. MONK Probably. But not more than, say, fifty dollars. Some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward, for which they are paid. It's part of the rehabilitation. \nLooking down, Clifford pauses over a page in the folder. \nCLOSEUP - FACT SHEET IN FOLDER \nA page of legibly organized facts and statistics about Curt Duncan. One of the entries reads: Guy du Marraux. \nCLIFFORD (O.S.) (reading) What's Guy du Mar-- \nDR. MONK (O.S.) (pronouncing it correctly) Guy du Marraux syndrom. \nBACK TO SCENE \nDR. MONK It's a psycho-motor dysfunction. \nCLIFFORD Duncan had it? \nDR. MONK Only from time to time, which is unusual. \nCLIFFORD What is it? \nDR. MONK It attacks the nervous system. People suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities, sometimes one, sometimes a whole string of them. They can't control it. \nCLIFFORD (somewhat taken aback) Are you being serious? \nDR. MONK Yeah. Here, I'll give you an example. \nHe opens a file cabinet drawer, finds a reel of quarter-inch magnetic tape and starts to thread it through a recorder on his desk. \nDR. MONK Duncan never had the twitch that sometimes goes with it. And with Duncan, as I said, the disease would only manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety. When he was really flipping out, in other words. \nThere is a pause as Monk fiddles with the tape recorder and Clifford looks back down at the folder. \nCLIFFORD Duncan was Catholic? \nDR. MONK Yeah. (beat) So am I. \nCLIFFORD (mildly surprised) That makes three of us. \nDR. MONK Is that right? So we all share the same guilt. \nClifford smiles. Monk keeps fiddling. \nDR. MONK Here. This is Curt Duncan shortly after he was admitted here in 1972. \nMonk turns on the tape recorder as Clifford sits forward in his chair to listen. \nAt first, nothing can be heard. Then there is a click as if the machine was turned on in the middle of a conversation: \n", "test2_true": "DUNCAN (O.S.) (extremely agitated) No. I don't eat the food. It doesn't taste right. \nDR. MONK (to Clifford) That's Duncan. \nClifford nods and keeps listening: \nDR. MONK (O.S.) Curt, why are you fidgeting? Can't you get comfortable? \nDUNCAN (O.S.) No, I'm not comfortable! \nDR. MONK (O.S.) Wait a -- Hey! (to someone else) Hold him down there. Grab him! Never mind the chair! \nThere are scuffling noises underneath which can be heard, heavy breathing and then, getting louder and more furious, Duncan falling into the throes of Guy du Marraux. \nDR. MONK (O.S.) (periodically interjecting) Pull him down... That's right... Just lay him out... Lay him right out... Steady... Pull out his knees... \nFinally Monk is heard no more and Duncan continues with the frightening verbal torrent of Guy du Marraux. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BAR - LATE AFTERNOON - CLOSEUP - DUNCAN \nSitting at his table inside the bar. He takes a long, noisy drink from what looks like a bourbon on the rocks. It tastes good, being the first real drink he's had in over six years. But Duncan cannot relax enough to enjoy it fully. His eyes are ever restlessly, suspiciously moving about. \nANGLE ON BAR \nAs Bill walks up and stands next to Tracy. Hank moves off to get Bill another beer. \nTracy looks up at Bill and smiles. As regulars at the same bar, they are loose and comfortable with each other. \nTRACY (sotto voce) A little action for your game? \nBILL (sotto voce) What, him? \nThey both turn and look across the room at Duncan. \nPOV - DUNCAN \nAs Bill and Tracy look straight at him over their shoulders and then turn back. \nANGLE ON BAR \nAs they both smile at her joke. \nTRACY I wouldn't bet against you. \nBILL What's the matter? You don't like me playing with myself? \nTracy grimaces as Hank comes back with Bill's beer. Bill picks up the bottle, nods his thanks to Hank and heads back to the pool table. \nCLOSEUP - DUNCAN \nAs his eyes follow Bill to the pool table, then come back to Tracy at the bar. \nPOV - DUNCAN \nLooking at the back of Tracy. She reaches into her purse. \nON TRACY \nShe takes her pack of cigarettes from the purse. She pulls out a cigarette, taps it lightly on the bar, puts it to her lips. \nO.S. we hear the sound of a match being struck. \nWIDER ANGLE \nDuncan is standing beside her holding a lit match. He shoves it forward at her. It goes out. \nDuncan fumbles for another match as Tracy regards him with undisguised repulsion. Duncan gets the second match lit and holds it out for her. She accepts the favor and lights her cigarette. \nDuncan smiles. Tracy nods and turns away. Duncan is still holding the burning match for her to blow out. As it doesn't look like she's going to, he lets it drop, still lit, to the floor. \n", "test2_id": 952, "test3_input": "BILL See ya 'round. \nHe turns and strides out of the bar. \nCAMERA HOLDS for a beat on Hank alone now in his empty establishment. The phone starts to ring, presumably the police calling back. \nAfter several rings, Hank picks up the phone and listens. \nHANK (into phone) No, it's over now... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LT. GARBER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAll the lights are out inside the house, but we should just be able to see that we are in the hall, looking at the front door. Footsteps approach on the walk outside. A key slips into the lock... \nInside the house we can hear faint whispering. Someone is moving about in the darkness. Then the door swings open and the shadowy figure of a MAN crosses the threshold. He stops just inside. \nMAN (calling out) Donna. Donna! Hey! (under his breath) What the hell -- ! \nSuddenly the lights come on and a chorus of voices cry out, \"SURPRISE!\" \nA broad smile breaks across the man's face. We may recognize him as the cop from six years ago -- Charles Garber. Today he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for work, usually in slacks, turtleneck and jacket. \nGARBER (genuinely surprised) What is all this?! \nSCATTERED VOICES Happy birthday, Charlie! \nGarber looks sheepishly at his hand holding the pistol he'd drawn just before the lights came up. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Look at him! \nMAN'S VOICE Don't shoot us, Charlie! \nGARBER (chagrined) How was I supposed to know? \nEverybody starts to laugh, including Garber as he returns the pistol to his shoulder holster. \nANGLE ON DONNA \nGarber's wife. She comes out of the kitchen carrying a birthday cake with lit candles and makes her way through the crowd of GUESTS singing \"Happy Birthday\". \nEveryone joins in as Donna moves forward and stands beside her husband. Clifford is one of the guests. He has his arm around a young BLOND who is sort of pretty despite her tacky/plastic appearance. \nWhen the song is over, Garber blows out the candles and hugs and kisses his wife. Everybody cheers. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GARBER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER \nThe party is still in full swing. Garber is following Clifford up the stairs. They are both fairly loaded by now. \nGarber, in particular, has reached that stage of inebriation where standing still is pretty hard to do. \nGARBER Will you tell me what this is about, Cliff? \nCLIFFORD Yeah, in a minute. \nGARBER I don't think I can take any more of these surprises. \nINT. A BEDROOM \nAs Clifford and Garber enter. Garber turns on a light as Clifford closes the door, shutting out the sounds of the party below. \nGARBER Okay now, what's the big deal? \nCLIFFORD Stand still. I want you to remember this in the morning. \nGARBER If you want me to remember something in the morning, then tell it to me in the morning. \nGarber half comically turns to go. Clifford stops him. \nCLIFFORD Charlie, come on. \n", "test3_true": "A BABY between a year and two years old is lying in a crib. It opens its eyes and starts looking around. \nGARBER (O.S.) All right, all right. What is it? You're getting married. \nCLIFFORD No. I got a job today, tracking someone. \nTWO SHOT - CLIFFORD & GARBER \nGarber, still moving restlessly, pats his friend on the shoulder. \nGARBER That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll find your man. \nCLIFFORD It's Curt Duncan. \nGarber stops suddenly, stunned. In an instant, he has become stone sober. \nGARBER What? \nANGLE ON BABY \nKicking and wiggling about. \nCLIFFORD (O.S.) You didn't know he got out? \nThe baby opens its mouth and starts to cry. \nTWO SHOT - CLIFFORD & GARBER \nGarber glances over his shoulder at the baby, then turns back to Clifford. \nCLIFFORD I need your cooperation on this one. \nGARBER Sure. Anything. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nIt is late. The block is virtually deserted. Across the street is the exterior of a bar -- the same bar Duncan was in earlier. Some PEOPLE are coming out of the bar. It must be near closing time. The people turn left and walk away down the sidewalk. Their voices diminish. Pause. \nA car passes. Then the door to the bar opens again and a woman comes out onto the sidewalk. It is Tracy. She turns to the right and starts to walk away. \nCLOSEUP - DUNCAN \nHe is standing in shadows across the street, watching her. \nEXT. TRACY ON STREET - NIGHT \nA series of shots of Tracy walking home. The CAMERA remains consistently behind her or off to one side, sometimes DOLLYING with her behind a row of parked cars, sometimes picking up her passing reflection in a darkened store window. \nThe impression this gives is unmistakable. Curt Duncan is following her. We do not see him, we do not hear him, yet we know he is there. Often we can sense that the very angle from which we see Tracy is his POV. \nBut Tracy is aware of nothing. We know this when the CAMERA begins to move in front of her, once more becoming an impersonal observer of her walk homeward, to safety. \nTension mounts as we start to expect that Duncan will jump out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes. But he doesn't. \nFinally, Tracy walks up to the CAMERA at the end of a block and turns a corner; but the CAMERA HOLDS on the dark street she has just come up. We hear a cough which confirms that Duncan is lurking somewhere in the shadows. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nTracy walks up the steps and enters the apartment. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING \nTracy steps into the elevator. The doors close. CAMERA HOLDS on the elevator and watches the lights above it travel from one to six. \nO.S. we hear the door to the apartment building open and close. \nINT. SIXTH FLOOR \nTracy steps out of the elevator and walks down the hall to her door. She fumbles through her purse for keys, then bends over the lock to let herself in. \n", "test3_id": 953}

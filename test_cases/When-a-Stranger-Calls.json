{"train": "JILL I've got a lot of work to do. I don't want you coming over! \nLong pause. \nNANCY (O.S.) You know what your problem is, Jill, is you're so straight. I really mean that. You go to a private school, you wear a bra. No one can have a good time with you! (beat) You know, Billy asked me to go out with him this weekend, and I was really really tempted because I like Billy... a lot... as much as you do. But I told him I couldn't, that I didn't think it was right because you were my friend -- \nJILL You are my friend. \nPause. \nNANCY (O.S.) Yeah. I guess so. \nJILL Listen, just give Billy the number here, but don't tell him I told you to. Okay? \nPause. \nNANCY (O.S.) Okay. I've got to go now. \nJILL Okay, Nancy. Bye. And thank you. \nNANCY (O.S.) Yeah. Bye. \nJill makes a face at the phone and hangs up. She tries to go back to her homework, but she cannot. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nJill is working now, diligently. The phone rings. She picks it up. \nJILL Hello? \nThere is a brief pause; then the line goes dead and a dial tone cuts in. Jill hangs up and goes back to work. \nPause. \nThe phone rings again. Jill picks it up. \nJILL Billy?... \nA VOICE speaks on the other end of the phone. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Have you checked the children? \nJILL What? \nThe line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and goes right back to work. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nJill sits at the table as before, doing her homework, smoking a cigarette. The phone rings. Jill picks it up. \nJILL Hello? \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Have you checked the children? \nJILL Mrs. Mandrakis? \nThe line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and looks off into space, thinking. \nO.S. we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the house. Jill hears it too. She stubs out her cigarette, gets up from the table and walks out of the living room. \nINT. HALLWAY \nJill enters the hallway and pauses. Then she starts walking slowly down the hall to the kitchen door. \nAgain the rattling noise O.S., only louder this time. Jill stops dead, listens, then continues forward even more cautiously. \nINT. KITCHEN \nAs Jill enters. She cannot find the lightswitch, so she stands in the darkness listening. Again the rattle, very close now. Jill turns her head sharply, then walks to the refrigerator and opens it. It is only the automatic icemaker creating the rattle. \nJILL That's right. \nSACKER (O.S.) Has he threatened you? \nJILL No. \nSACKER (O.S.) Has he been using obscene language? \nJILL No. He just keeps calling me. Sometimes he doesn't say anything. \nSACKER (O.S.) There's really nothing we can do about it down here. Is the phone listed in your name? \nJILL No, I'm just the babysitter. \nSACKER (O.S.) It's probably just some weirdo. The city's full of them. Believe it or not, we get reports like this every night. It's nothing to worry about. \nJILL Oh... \nSACKER (O.S.) Have you tried whistling? \nJILL What? \nSACKER (O.S.) If you can find a good loud whistle somewhere in the house, blow it into the phone hard, next time he calls. Probably break his eardrum. He won't bother you after that. \nJILL No, I... You're probably right. It's nothing to worry about. \nSACKER (O.S.) Or you could just take your phone off the hook. \nJILL No, the people I'm babysitting for might try to reach me. \nSACKER (O.S.) Well, as I say, there's nothing we can really do to help you down here. \nJILL Okay. Thank you. \nSACKER (O.S.) You bet. Goodnight. \nJILL Goodnight. \nJill hangs up. After thinking for a moment, she tries a couple of ways of whistling as loud as she can, but frustrated and feeling foolish, she soon gives up. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nJill is sitting in an armchair facing the TV set. The TV is on, but she is bored. She runs through several channels, then gets up and turns the TV off. \nShe looks around and moves aimlessly back to the table, but O.S. a dog is barking and she is drawn to the window. A car passes outside, its lights reflecting off the window and Jill's face. \nThen the phone rings. Jill moves quickly from the window to the table and answers the phone. \nJILL Hello? \nPause. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Why haven't you checked the children? \nStunned, Jill hangs up the phone. She turns and goes slowly back to the window. She pulls the shutters closed in front of the window. Then she walks out of the living room. \nINT. FRONT HALL \nJill goes to the front door, turns the bolt and draws the chain across the door. Then she starts to go upstairs. \nThe phone rings. She stops halfway up the stairs. She turns and comes back down the stairs to answer the phone, but then thinks better of it. She sits on the bottom step and lets the phone ring and ring... \nFinally, it stops. Jill gets up and heads into the living room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nJill goes to the table, picks up the phone and dials... \nSACKER (O.S.) Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker. \nJILL I called you before... about the man who keeps calling me? \nJILL Hello? \nPause. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) It's me. \nJILL I know. Who are you? \nPause. No answer. \nJILL I won't be here much longer. The doctor and his wife are coming home soon. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) I know. \nJILL Can you see me? \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Yes. \nJILL (turning toward the window) I'm sorry I turned the lights down. It didn't work anyway. I can turn them back up if you like -- \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Don't. \nJILL Don't? (beat) You've really scared me. Is that what you wanted? (beat) Is that what you wanted? \nDUNCAN (O.S.) No. \nJILL What do you want? \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Your blood... all over me. \nPause. Jill is terrified. \nJILL You don't know me. You don't know who I am or where I live. I'll get Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him or the police. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) You've called the police? \nPause. Jill searches for some way of answering him. \nJILL I want to talk to you. \nThe line goes dead. Jill hangs up. She stands. She starts to shake. \nThe phone rings and Jill snatches it up. \nJILL Leave me alone! \nSACKER (O.S.) Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker! Listen to me! (beat) We've traced the call. It's coming from within the house. A squad car's on its way over there now... just get out of that house! \nJill hangs up. She stands frozen in shock. Several seconds go by. She doesn't move. \nThen the phone rings. She turns and tiptoes toward the front door. Halfway there, the phone stops ringing. She pauses for a second, then continues. \nINT. FRONT HALL \nJill reaches the front door. Carefully, quietly, she turns the bolt. Then O.S. she hears a creak. She turns and looks up the staircase. At the top, a door is opening. Someone is coming out! A mumbling sound is heard on the sound track. \nJill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it. It opens, but only an inch. The chain is still across it! She frantically works to get the chain free. After agonizing seconds, the chain falls clear and the door swings open. \nStanding there on the other side of the door, is a police Detective, JOHN CLIFFORD. (We have cut ahead in time some twenty or thirty minutes.) Behind him on the street, several patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb, their domelights silently flashing. \nCLIFFORD Are the parents here yet? \nCOP'S VOICE (O.S.) Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes ago. \nCLIFFORD Christ! (beat) What a homecoming! \nCOP'S VOICE (O.S.) They wanted to talk to someone. I asked them to wait until you got here. Come on in. \nClifford sighs and steps into the front hall. The door is closed by the uniformed COP with whom Clifford has been speaking. The cop is a man in his thirties. His name is CHARLES GARBER. Garber and Clifford stand in the front hall and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move around them. In the living room beyond can be seen several other POLICEMEN, Dr. Mandrakis and his wife. \nGARBER We were only a block away when the call went out. When we got here, the guy was still waiting upstairs in the children's bedroom. He was covered with blood. \nCLIFFORD Blood? \nCLIFFORD Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this week, but I'll find him. \nMASTER He could be anywhere by now. \nCLIFFORD I don't think so... because he's a foreigner. He'll come back to the city. After six years in confinement, it's the only place that's familiar to him. That's important. \nPause. \nMASTER A man murders two children in cold blood. A jury declares him insane. How could such a person not be? \nClifford lowers his eyes, doesn't answer. \nMASTER He is sent to a state mental institution where the security is... less than perfect. And he escapes. It... it isn't fair. \nThe master of the house leans way forward over his desk, and his face comes out of the shadows and into the light. It is Dr. Mandrakis. \nHe seems much older. His complexion is pallid. His eyes stare out from beneath his brow like a wounded animal hiding in a dark cave. \nMANDRAKIS A thing like that should never be allowed to happen again. \nCLIFFORD I couldn't agree with you more. \nThey look at each other for a long moment of acknowledgment. Then Mandrakis stands up with a sigh. \nMANDRAKIS Go ahead then. My accountant will contact you. \nClifford stands and they shake hands. \nCLIFFORD Thank you. (beat) How is Mrs. Mandrakis? \nMANDRAKIS She is... unable to have any more children. \nCLIFFORD I'm sorry. Please give her my best. \nMANDRAKIS Of course. \nClifford turns to go. \nINT. MANSION - STAIRCASE & ENTRANCE HALL \nAs Clifford finds his own way down the stairs and out the front door. \nA WOMAN watches Clifford leave from the back of the staircase. It is Mrs. Mandrakis. As with her husband, the change in her is remarkable. She is now a brooding, barren woman. \nO.S. the front door closes. Clifford is gone. Mrs. Mandrakis walks around the front of the stairs and begins slowly ascending them. \nThe houseboy silently steps into the entrance hall from a side door and watches her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A HALLWAY - MENTAL INSTITUTION - DAY \nA male PATIENT wearing green, institutional pajamas and slippers shuffles slowly up the hall. His movement is catatonic, unfocused. \nCanned Musak faintly underscores the scene. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Curt Duncan isn't going to run right out and kill more children. I'm not worried about that. \nANGLE ON CLIFFORD \nStanding in the doorway of an office, facing into the hall, watching the patient. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) We had him for six years... under continuous therapy, some of it rather forceful... \nANGLE ON PATIENT \nMoving past CAMERA. He is really out of it. It is a depressing, vaguely unnerving sight. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) ...and drugs... tranquilizers depressants, lithium... \nANGLE ON CLIFFORD \nHe turns and goes back into the office. \nHANK C'mon in and shut the door. \nThe intruder enters, indecisively. The door swings shut behind him, plunging the room back into darkness. This man is \"a little weird\", and the regulars continue to stare at him until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits down. Then everyone returns to his own thoughts. \nHANK (after a moment) What'll it be? (pause, no answer) Hey! What'll it be? \nCLOSEUP - INTRUDER \nA bit startled, a bit defensive toward the directness of this question. It is Curt Duncan. He looks understandably harried. He hasn't slept or shaved in at least a couple of days, and is wearing regular clothing. \nHe clears his throat to answer... \nCLIFFORD (O.S.) What kind of clothes was he wearing... when he escaped? \nCUT TO: \nINT. DR. MONK'S OFFICE -DAY \nClifford is looking through the folder again. \nDR. MONK Ordinary street clothes. Not all of our patients have to wear the green Gucci gowns. \nCLIFFORD Did he have any money with him? \nDR. MONK Probably. But not more than, say, fifty dollars. Some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward, for which they are paid. It's part of the rehabilitation. \nLooking down, Clifford pauses over a page in the folder. \nCLOSEUP - FACT SHEET IN FOLDER \nA page of legibly organized facts and statistics about Curt Duncan. One of the entries reads: Guy du Marraux. \nCLIFFORD (O.S.) (reading) What's Guy du Mar-- \nDR. MONK (O.S.) (pronouncing it correctly) Guy du Marraux syndrom. \nBACK TO SCENE \nDR. MONK It's a psycho-motor dysfunction. \nCLIFFORD Duncan had it? \nDR. MONK Only from time to time, which is unusual. \nCLIFFORD What is it? \nDR. MONK It attacks the nervous system. People suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities, sometimes one, sometimes a whole string of them. They can't control it. \nCLIFFORD (somewhat taken aback) Are you being serious? \nDR. MONK Yeah. Here, I'll give you an example. \nHe opens a file cabinet drawer, finds a reel of quarter-inch magnetic tape and starts to thread it through a recorder on his desk. \nDR. MONK Duncan never had the twitch that sometimes goes with it. And with Duncan, as I said, the disease would only manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety. When he was really flipping out, in other words. \nThere is a pause as Monk fiddles with the tape recorder and Clifford looks back down at the folder. \nCLIFFORD Duncan was Catholic? \nDR. MONK Yeah. (beat) So am I. \nCLIFFORD (mildly surprised) That makes three of us. \nDR. MONK Is that right? So we all share the same guilt. \nClifford smiles. Monk keeps fiddling. \nDR. MONK Here. This is Curt Duncan shortly after he was admitted here in 1972. \nMonk turns on the tape recorder as Clifford sits forward in his chair to listen. \nAt first, nothing can be heard. Then there is a click as if the machine was turned on in the middle of a conversation: \nREACTION SHOT - BARTENDER \nHe gives a look as if to say, \"Jesus, what a fuckin' weirdo\". \nTWO SHOT - DUNCAN AND TRACY \nPause. Duncan is still smiling at her. \nDUNCAN Hi. \nNo response. \nDUNCAN What you been up to? \nTRACY (looking at him) My own business. (beat) Thanks for the light. Okay? \nThe Englishman sits down beside her, but doesn't look at her. \nTracy looks away too, determined to ignore him, not to let him get into her space. \nDuncan coughs. After a long moment, he turns back to her. \nDUNCAN Next round's on me. \nTracy keeps her eyes straight ahead, acknowledging nothing. \nPause. \nDuncan takes some money from his pocket and lays it on the bar, staring at her. Tracy turns to him: \nTRACY (annoyed) Listen, mister, I've got my own money. So, if you don't mind... \nShe looks away again. Pause. \nDUNCAN After what I been through, I don't mind anything. \nLonger pause. \nDUNCAN See, that's the whole point. My mind... Your mind... Where do they fit in? You know what I mean? \nTracy abruptly picks up her purse and moves down the bar away from him one seat, then another seat. \nANGLE ON ELDERLY COUPLE \nThey are watching this little spectacle with growing curiosity. \nANGLE ON DUNCAN \nStill looking at her. By pointing at what she has, he orders two more drinks from the Bartender. When they arrive, he takes a big swallow from one, picks up the other, stands, moves down the bar and sits beside Tracy again. \nDUNCAN (setting her drink before her) Do you live around here? \nTRACY Get offa me!! \nREACTION SHOTS \nEven Bill now looks up from the pool table. His expression darkens. \nANGLE ON BAR \nTracy has clammed up -- her elbows on the bar, head between her elbows, arms covering her ears, hands clasped behind her neck. Duncan looks at her nervously and starts to talk again: \nDUNCAN (rapidly) Listen, I didn't mean nothin'. I don't live around here. See -- ? \nBILL (O.S.) I think the lady wants to be left alone. \nDuncan looks up. Bill enters the frame and stands in front of Tracy, confronting Duncan. \nCLOSEUP - DUNCAN \nLooking up at Bill, his eyes red, his gaze unsteady. \nWIDER ANGLE \nBehind her down the hall, Duncan appears. He watches her, starts to move silently forward. Tracy gets the door open, then turns and sees him. Duncan stops. \nTRACY Oh, it's you! (beat) What do you want? \nDUNCAN (moving forward) ...Came to apologize. I... \nTRACY Look, I'm the one who should be sorry. I didn't want that to happen. (she sees his face; shudders) Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all right. \nDuncan half shrugs, half smiles. Tracy edges into her door- way. Duncan stands opposite her. \nDUNCAN I'm new in town. Don't know anybody... \nTRACY (uncomfortable) Where're you from? \nDUNCAN (coughs) New York. Ever been there? \nTRACY Sure. Sure I've been there. \nThey look at each other. Duncan coughs again. \nDUNCAN Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone cold, unfriendly... \nInside Tracy's apartment, the telephone rings. Tracy turns vaguely, indecisively, and goes to answer it. \nTRACY (over her shoulder) Excuse me. \nShe disappears into the apartment. O.S. she picks up the ringing phone. \nTRACY (O.S.) Hello?... \nINT. TRACY'S APARTMENT \nAs she sits with the telephone. \nTRACY (nervous) ...No, I just got in... I don't know if I can... Listen, I can't talk now. Can I call you back?... Okay... Goodbye. \nShe hangs up the phone, stands and turns back toward the door. Duncan is standing right behind her. \nDUNCAN I'm not from New York, actually. But I'm very, very far from home. \nHe sits down. \nTRACY Look, you can't come in here. \nDuncan looks at her for a moment, then looks about the apartment. \nDUNCAN (mumbling) I thought we might get some coffee. Can I buy you -- ? \nTRACY I don't think so. \nDUNCAN Someplace nearby? \nTRACY Not tonight. You'd better go. \nDUNCAN I got no place to go. \nTRACY (anxious) You can't -- \nDUNCAN Just, just a little coffee? \nTRACY Maybe tomorrow. \nDUNCAN Okay, tomorrow. When? \nTRACY I said maybe. I don't know. (beat) Listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon. I really am. All right? That was my boyfriend on the phone. He's coming over. So please leave. Now. \nDuncan doesn't move. He smiles at her. \nDUNCAN I like you. \nTRACY (her voice rising) Look, do you want me to call the cops? \nDUNCAN (standing) It's okay. It's okay. \nBACK TO SCENE \nClifford looks up from the pad to a bar he has pulled up in front of -- the bar Duncan was in. It bears the address Clifford has just underlined. Clifford gets out of his car and walks up to the bar. A \"Closed\" sign is displayed in the window. Clifford knocks on the door. After a moment, Hank opens the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY \nThere are only a few CUSTOMERS sitting around, waiting for their wash. A BUM is stretched out on his back across one of the tables like a corpse awaiting autopsy. This is CHEATER. \nA MAINTENANCE MAN in grey work clothes enters from the back. He opens a broom closet, takes out a bucket and mop and rolls them toward the front of the laundromat. He stops at Cheater's table and shakes him hard. \nMAINTENANCE MAN Okay, man, move it out. Let's go. \nCHEATER Wha -- ? \nCheater sits up and starts to pull himself together. An OLD WOMAN sitting against the wall points down one of the aisles of washing machines and says to the maintenance man: \nOLD WOMAN There's another one down there. \nThe maintenance man goes to the end of the aisle and looks down into the nook created by the absence of one of the washing machines. \nMAINTENANCE MAN Hey! \nHe nudges at whatever's inside the nook with his foot. \nMAINTENANCE MAN (nudging again) Come on, bright eyes. Wake up. Wake -- Jesus Christ! What happened to you? \nANGLE ON NOOK \nAs Curt Duncan raises his head into the light and looks up at the maintenance man. Overnight, his face has swollen considerably and a bright yellow and purple discoloring around his bruises has emerged. \nMAINTENANCE MAN (O.S.) You get hit by a truck or what? \nHe bends over and helps pull Duncan to his feet. \nWIDER ANGLE \nAs the maintenance man guides Duncan to the door. \nMAINTENANCE MAN I'm sorry, man, but you can't stay in here. Go out to the park, lay in the sunshine. You'll feel better. Okay? \nDuncan goes out the door. The maintenance man turns and sees Cheater stretched out again on the table. \nMAINTENANCE MAN God bless it! Hey! \nHe pulls Cheater off the table and pushes him to the door. \nMAINTENANCE MAN Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. \nEXT. LAUNDROMAT \nAs Cheater is pushed out onto the sidewalk. \nCHEATER (angry) All right! All right! \nHe straightens his rags indignantly, then looks at Duncan and grins. \nCHEATER Whaddya say, pardner. I'm dry as a bone. You got any money? \nDuncan looks at Cheater distrustfully and shakes his head. \nCHEATER You neither, huh? (with a laugh) My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P. Guess I better go to work. Take 'er easy now, pardner. \nCheater shuffles off in one direction. Duncan turns and goes in the other. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TRACY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nA knock at the front door. After a moment, Tracy comes into the front hallway and, crossing to the door, stubs her toe on the open closet door. She swears under her breath and angrily slams the closet door shut. Then, grabbing her injured toe, she hops to the front door. \nTRACY Who is it? \nSound over: knocking on a door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BAR - DAY \nClifford is standing at the door. The \"Closed\" sign still hangs in the window. The door opens, and Hank sticks his head out. \nHANK You again? \nCLIFFORD What are your hours tonight? \nHANK No hours. Bar's closed on Mondays. \nCLIFFORD I want you to be open if that's possible. \nHANK (closing the door) No way. Monday's my night off. Come back tomorr... \nClifford violently pushes the door open. The bartender backs off, surprised. \nCLIFFORD (through clenched teeth) This is tomorrow! Now what are your hours? \nCUT TO: \nINT. LT. GARBER'S OFFICE - DAY \nGarber is sitting behind his desk as Clifford walks in. \nGARBER (looking up) Any luck? \nCLIFFORD I've come to say goodbye, and thank you. \nGARBER You found him? \nCLIFFORD I think so. \nGARBER Where? \nPause. \nCLIFFORD From here on, I go it alone. \nGARBER What's the point of chancing it, Cliff? We'll let you take the credit. \nCLIFFORD No. \nPause. Clifford sits down. \nCLIFFORD I'm going to kill him, Charlie. \nGarber leans forward in his chair and stares at Clifford. A long moment passes. A button on the lieutenant's phone lights up and the intercom buzzes. Garber doesn't even look down at it. The button flashes on and off, on and off. Finally it stops. \nCLIFFORD The closer I get to this guy, the more I... It gets to me. I don't know... \nGARBER I think you'd better go on home, Cliff. You've fallen in. \nCLIFFORD No. Not this time. This is the case that makes up for a whole career. If you can't understand it now, you will in a few years. \nPause. Garber considers another tack and follows it. \nGARBER What part does money play in all this? Play straight with me. \nClifford is stunned by the question, but he tries to be casual. \nCLIFFORD (shrugging) For what I'm being paid, it's not out of line. \nGARBER Who's hired you for this? \nClifford glares at his friend and doesn't answer. \nGARBER (cynically) So you're a hitman now. \nCLIFFORD (passionately) He murdered two kids in cold blood. You were there, too. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK \nA series of shots of BUMS, \"homeless persons\", hanging out, in alleys, in the doorways of old buildings, sitting on the sidewalk in front of liquor stores. \nThen we see Duncan, alone but looking no different from the others. He is panhandling PASSERSBY, without much success. We see him fall into a fit of coughing that incapacitates him for several seconds. He's obviously getting sicker. \nWe lose sight of Duncan as our MONTAGE continues. We see Clifford talking to a BUM, then another. He is passing the time combing the streets in the neighborhood of the bar. \nPARK - DUSK \nA handful of BUMS are sitting together on the grass passing a bottle in a brown paper bag. Duncan is not among them, but Cheater is there, sitting at the end of the line. \nCAMERA PANS from one bum to the next as the bottle is passed. By the time it gets to Cheater, it is empty. Cheater looks as if he's about to cry like a baby when a hand enters the frame from the other side -- the hand holding out to Cheater a full bottle of wine. Cheater takes the bottle and looks up gratefully... to see John Clifford standing beside him. \nCHEATER Well! I can't say much for your protocol, but your timing's dead on. Here's to you, pardner. \nCheater takes a long drink, then passes the bottle back down the line. \nCLIFFORD (to all the bums) I'm looking for an old buddy of mine, English fella. Name's Crazy Curt. Any of you guys seen him? \nNobody responds. \nCLIFFORD I owe him some money. \nCHEATER Aaahh. Show me an honest man... \nCLIFFORD (gesturing) Stands about so. Brown hair. Face kind of banged up. Was in an accident. \nCHEATER Oh, yeah? I was just with that guy, not more'n an hour ago. Looked bad. Crazy Curt, huh? \nCLIFFORD Where? \nCheater scratches his head, and glances anxiously down the line. \nCHEATER Hell, I can't remember. Prob'bly see him again though. Tell you what. You leave the money with me, I'll see he gets it... as a favor to you. \nClifford shakes his head. \nCLIFFORD I have to talk to him. \nCHEATER Whatsa matter? You don't trust me? I'll have you know I used to be a college professor. We can work together. \nClifford stands to go. The bottle comes back to Cheater, three-quarters down. \nCLIFFORD Sure. Keep the bottle. I'll be back. \nCHEATER \"Long life to the grape! For when summer is flown, The age of our nectar Shall gladden our own.\" That's Shelley, you know. \nClifford is gone. Cheater takes a long drink and almost forgets that Clifford was ever there. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLIFFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nClifford is \"suiting up\" for his night's work. He is dressed casually -- blue jeans, shirt open at the neck, sports jacket, Adidas running shoes. He looks at himself in the mirror, is satisfied. Then he picks up from the dresser two awl-like instruments with short handles and long, glistening tapered needlepoints -- his weapons. He slides them into a leather sheath inside his jacket and turns to go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BAR - NIGHT \nIt is lit up inside. The bar is open for business. Across the street in a dark space between two buildings, Duncan is waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes out. \nINT. BAR \nThe place is empty but for Hank who half watches the television over the bar, and Tracy who sits alone in a corner. Several moments pass as both of them sit and wait. \nThen, the front door starts to swing open. Someone is coming in. Tracy and Hank both glance nervously toward the door. \nA MAN'S head peeks in. He is somewhere in his forties, a regular customer. \nCUSTOMER Hey, Hank, what're you doing open tonight? \nHANK (relaxing) Trying to make a buck. \nINT. FRONT HALL \nTracy goes up to the closet with her coat. The door is closed. She opens it. She hangs up her coat and closes the door again. Then she turns and starts walking out of the hallway to the living room. \nAs she is rounding the corner into the living room, she walks right into Duncan. She barely has time to gasp before he clamps his hand over her mouth and pushes her against the wall. \nDUNCAN (urgent whisper) I just have to talk to you. (pathetically) I want you to be my friend. \nAs she isn't struggling, he starts to loosen up on her. \nDUNCAN Please... \nHe takes his hand away from her mouth, lets go of her, and slowly, cautiously steps back. Tracy looks at him for a breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear. Then she screams. \nDuncan jumps back, stunned, frightened and confused. Tracy doesn't move. She just keeps screaming hysterically. \nEXT. STREET \nTracy's screams carry out into the night as Clifford races across the street and into the apartment building. \nINT. TRACY'S APARTMENT \nDuncan runs to a window, throws it open and climbs out onto the fire escape. \nINTERCUT - APARTMENT STAIRS AND FIRE ESCAPE \nAs Clifford bounds up the stairs, flight after flight, and Duncan tears down the fire escape. \nINT. SIXTH FLOOR \nThe screaming has stopped when Clifford reaches Tracy's door. He grabs the doorknob and heaves himself against the door. It's bolted shut. \nClifford pulls one of the needles from his jacket and hammers it into the lock. The bolt springs and Clifford runs into the apartment. \nINT. TRACY'S APARTMENT \nAs Clifford bursts in. Tracy gestures toward the window. Clifford runs to it and sticks his head out. \nPOV - CLIFFORD \nDuncan is gone. \nBACK TO SCENE \nClifford runs to a window on another wall and looks out onto the street. \nPOV - CLIFFORD \nNo sign of the Englishman. \nBACK TO SCENE \nClifford runs out of the apartment, yanking his needle from the lock as he passes the door, and charges back down the stairs. \nTracy moves to the door and closes it. She is breathing heavily. \nO.S. we hear the angry sizzle of coffee spilling onto the hot stove, as Tracy goes to get it. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING \nClifford comes out, looks around and moves rapidly up the street. \nEXT. A STREET \nDuncan is hurrying along, dodging in and out of people, trying to move quickly but not draw attention to himself... \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET \nClifford is travelling along the sidewalk, crossing the street, looking everywhere... \nEXT. ALLEYWAY \nDuncan is running up the alley. He comes to a stop beside some piled up trash cans. He leans against the brick wall of the building, huffing and puffing. He is frightened, but he feels safe for now. He slowly slides down the wall to the ground... \nSuddenly, we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room. The floor is crawling with rats, hundreds of them. The \"chit-chit\" rises to practically a roar as the boy, alone on top of the bed, begins to wail. \nThe room seems to darken, and the boy becomes just a little white speck in it. The focus is turned. The picture becomes a black and white blur. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - THE PRESENT \nAt first all that can be seen is a white blur against a black screen. The previous sound of a boy crying increases. Then the blur grows larger, coming more into focus as the entire screen image moves toward normal definition. Finally, we know we are back in the alleyway, that it is night, and that the white blur is actually a little BOY lost, sobbing uncontrollably. \nCLOSEUP - DUNCAN \nAwakening to the scene, coming back to reality. He is confused. \nWIDER ANGLE ON DUNCAN AND BOY \nThe boy continues sobbing, moving about in little circles. Duncan, amazed at what he sees, slowly crawls out from the wall on his hands and knees, crawls toward the weeping child, staring at it with a strange look on his face. \nSuddenly the boy stops crying and looks at Duncan quizzically, hesitantly. They are less than a foot apart, almost face to face. Together they form a kind of frozen tableau. Something close to sympathy crosses the killer's expression, and the boy, likewise, achieves a faint sense of recognition. \nThen, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he runs off down the alleyway. Duncan watches him disappear. Then he slowly pulls himself to his feet. \nEXT. STREET \nClifford is coming up the sidewalk. As Clifford crosses the entrance to an alleyway, the boy comes running out and almost collides with him. Clifford grabs the boy and looks down at him. Then he passes the wailing child off on a nearby PEDESTRIAN and runs up into the alley. \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET \nDuncan is hurrying along the sidewalk. Something makes him look up. \nPOV - DUNCAN \nHe is looking at a neon \"Jesus Saves\" sign above the doorway to an inner city mission. \nBACK ON DUNCAN \nAs he stares at the sign. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Hey, Crazy Curt! \nDuncan turns to see Cheater elatedly hobbling up to him. \nCHEATER Hail fellow well met, and all that jazz. It's our lucky day! (taking Duncan by the arm) A friend of your's got money for you. We got to get back to the park and meet him. \nDuncan pulls his arm free. \nCHEATER C'mon. He'll be comin' for you, Crazy Curt. S'got some money. (reaching for Duncan's arm) We'll get us a little joy juice. \nDuncan pulls free again and heads toward the mission. \nCHEATER C'mon! Hey!! You really are crazy! C'mon! \nDuncan enters the mission and Cheater stands out on the sidewalk for a moment, bitterly frustrated. \nCHEATER \"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow, you cataracts and hurricanoes, spout till you have drench'd our steeples and drown'd the cocks!\" \nSeveral PEDESTRIANS stop and gape at this sudden outburst. \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET \nClifford comes out of a derelict hotel, looks up and down the street and hurries off, not giving up the chase. \nINT. MISSION - MOMENTS LATER \nA MAN is leading Duncan to the bathroom. Duncan enters slowly and goes to one of the wash basins where there is an old razor blade and a can of shaving cream. Duncan picks up the razor for a moment and looks at it. He is lost in thought. Then he sets it down and turns on the tap water. \nHe glances at himself in the mirror and is suddenly transfixed by his own image. He looks deeply into the mirror for several seconds. Then he starts to cry, and having begun, a flood of emotions comes pouring out of him. He drops to his knees. \nThe man comes running back into the bathroom. He holds Duncan and helps pull him back to his feet. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nINT. BELL TOWER \nDuncan faces a spiraling stone staircase. He has no choice but to climb them, higher and higher, the sound of Clifford's angry footsteps always coming up behind him. \nFinally, Duncan can climb no higher. He is at the top of the bell tower. A lanceted opening in the stone wall ahead of him looks out over the narrow shaft of the tower. Above him are the huge iron bells. A rope hangs down from the bells, dangling all the way down the shaft, forty or fifty feet to the floor of the church. \nClifford is bounding up the last flight of steps to get him. Duncan has little choice. He is trapped. Just before Clifford reaches him, Duncan leaps out into the shaft and catches the bell rope. \nThe bell starts to clang as Duncan, hanging in mid air, swings back and forth within the narrow shaft. Clifford leans way out through the lancet window and takes a swipe at Duncan, but the madman is just beyond his reach and hurriedly climbing down the rope. \nClifford reaches out and tries to grab at the rope. At last, he gets it, and he shakes it violently to get Duncan to lose his grip and be dashed against the stone floor below. \nBut Duncan holds firm, climbing ever downward. The bell continues to clang, sending its alarm out into the night. Then Clifford braces himself and slowly, laboriously begins to haul up on the rope. \nClifford gains momentum until Duncan is being pulled up faster than he is climbing down. Still twenty feet off the ground, Duncan lets go of the rope and plummets to the hard stone floor. \nThen PEOPLE come rushing into the church, awakened by the commotion of the bells. Duncan rolls into the shadows and drags himself out a side door, while Clifford plans his own escape from the bell tower. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEYWAY NEAR CHURCH - NIGHT \nClifford runs up the alleyway, looks around and finally realizes he's lost his prey. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ANOTHER ALLEYWAY \nDuncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two buildings, catching his breath. CAMERA MOVES IN on him, and we see him looking the craziest he's ever been. He shakes uncontrollably and begins to mumble, softly at first, then getting louder. He's falling back into the grips of Guy du Marraux. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CITY - MORNING \nA. All is still and quiet as soft, warm sunlight pours into the dirty streets and alleyways. In the background, the bell tower of the church rises above the skyline. \nB. We see a SHOT of the park -- all the bums are asleep. \nC. Then a SHOT of the mission -- its front door open, the sidewalk empty. \nD. Then the bar, where the same peaceful mood prevails. \nE. Then the alleyway where we last saw Curt Duncan. Now he is gone. \nF. Then the exterior of Tracy's apartment building. Clifford's car is parked out front. \nTRACY (O.S.) I used to see my two kids every weekend. They lived in a nice house with their father, outside the city. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TRACY'S APARTMENT \nTracy and Clifford are sitting at a small table in the kitchen, looking haggard, drinking coffee. \nTRACY Now... it's been years. They're grown up. \nThey look at each other. Clifford is a sympathetic listener. \nTRACY I look at where I am now. I know I could've done better, but... it's too late for that. \nCLIFFORD (quietly) I know. \nPause. \nTRACY Well, you've got to keep looking, I suppose. \nTaking his cue, Clifford slowly rises. \nCLIFFORD I don't think he'll come back here. \nTracy looks up at him questioningly, wishing she could feel as sure about it as he does. \nCLIFFORD (extending his hand) Thanks... for all your help. \nJill shoves the coat into his stomach. Smiling, he takes the coat and dutifully helps her on with it. \nCAROL Have a good time. \nJILL Thanks, Carol. \nJOHN (pulling her out the door) Bye, Carol. \nCAROL Goodbye. \nJILL Goodbye. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nJohn and Jill walk to the station wagon in the driveway as Carol shuts the front door in the background. Just before Jill gets into the car, she takes a look back at the house -- there is a moment's hesitance, and then she gets in the car. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nCarol picks up the phone and carries it into the living room with her. As she does it, we see lying on the phone table, the newspaper clipping with Jill's picture, and headline: \"Jill Lockhart Chairs Community UNICEF Drive.\" \nShe puts the phone down, then her books, then herself. She dials a number. Her BOYFRIEND answers. \nBOYFRIEND (O.S.) Hello? \nCAROL Hi. It's me. \nBOYFRIEND (O.S.) Oh, hi. \nCAROL Can you come over? \nBOYFRIEND (O.S.) I can't. I really have a lot of work to do. \nCAROL (disappointed) Ohhh... \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nAn Italian Restaurant. Quiet music, soft lights, red and white checkered tablecloths, candles, a smokey and seductive atmosphere. \nDOLLY with a LATIN WAITER carrying a huge tray of food over- head. He passes right by the table where Jill and John are sitting. John watches him take the food to someone else. \nJOHN (reaching for a breadstick) I've eaten enough breadsticks to turn into a pretzel. \nJILL John, tell me about the surprise. \nJOHN Oh, yeah. Brace yourself. \nJILL I'm braced. \nJOHN Good. I got the sack today. \nJILL What sack? \nJOHN The can... I was fired! \nJILL Oh, sure. \nJOHN You don't believe me? \nJILL No, I don't believe you. \nJOHN Well, Wally did call me into his office today. And he did tell me I didn't have my old job anymore. \nJILL (getting excited) John, what did you get? \nJOHN Are you ready for this? \nJILL (guessing) District Sales Manager! \nJOHN Regional! \nAs John runs up and drops to his knees beside her. She is shaking and sobbing uncontrollably. \nJOHN Jill, what's happening? What's wrong? \nJILL It was him! Somebody call the police! Help me! \nOther PEOPLE have crowded around and are making urgent noises now about calling the police, an ambulance, etc. John tries to cut through the confusion and anxiety. \nJOHN Wait a minute! Just hold on! Sweetheart, what was him? What are you talking about? \nJILL That man... Curt Duncan... He's home again! He's got our children! \nJOHN He was on the phone? \nJill nods. \nJohn grabs the telephone and quickly dials a number. The crowd tries to quiet down, as much to hear for themselves as to let John talk. The phone rings and rings. Finally... \nCAROL Hello? \nJOHN Hello, Carol, it's Mr. Lockhart. What's going on over there? \nCAROL Nothing's going on. \nJOHN Is everything all right? \nCAROL Yes, there's nothing -- \nJOHN Are you sure? \nPause. \nCAROL Everything's fine. Why? What's --? \nJOHN Carol, listen to me very carefully. If there's a man in the house, if there's any reason why you can't talk to me right now, just answer yes to me over the phone. That's all. If there's any danger of any kind, just say yes. \nLong pause. They wait for her answer. Jill is listening into the receiver now, too. \nCAROL I don't understand what's happening. What man in the house? \nJill is confused. John breathes a guarded sigh of relief. Jill takes the phone. \nJILL Carol, it's Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me truthfully. When was the last time you looked in on the children? \nCAROL About forty-five minutes ago. Everything's fine. They were fast asleep. \nJill gives her husband a look. John takes the phone again. \nJOHN Carol, I'm sorry about all the hysterics. We're leaving the restaurant now. We'll explain everything when we get home. Before we hang up, could you do just one more thing for me, please? \nCAROL What? \nJOHN Would you go upstairs and, and check on the children for me? \nJill is violently shaking her head. John silences her with a gesture. \nCAROL Sure. Hold on. \nCarol O.S. puts the phone down. Then there is silence on the other end. The crowd of people around Jill and John begin to shuffle and murmur. John tries to keep them quiet while listening into the phone. \nThen TWO POLICEMEN come forward through the crowd. One of them kneels down to John and Jill who are still on the floor. \nPOLICEMAN #1 What seems to be the problem here, sir? \nJOHN (whispering) Officer, I'm John Lockhart. Just a second please, and I'll explain everything. \nJILL (whispering to Policeman) I'm Jill Johnson, the babysitter seven years ago with the child killer. \nThis means nothing to Policeman #1. \nJOHN The babysitter. The guy got into the house and killed the two children upstairs. \nPoliceman #2 kneels down now. \nJOHN If I ever get my hands on the guy that made that call... \nJILL John, it wasn't a prank. I know that voice. \nJOHN He disguised it though, didn't he? Same as before? \nJILL I know that voice. \nPause. \nJILL How can we just sit here? \nJohn turns and moves over beside her. \nJOHN Look, we promised never to talk about this. \nREACTION SHOT of Jill. She is shocked. \nJOHN What are we supposed to do? Leave town? Take the kids and lock ourselves up somewhere? Come on... Let's get a good night's sleep, and in the morning we can rethink this whole thing. \nJILL Nothing has to be rethought. And I'm not about to fall asleep. \nJOHN Try to relax, honey. I'm here. We're both here. The house is locked up. The cops'll be just outside all night long. We're safe now. \nJILL That's what they told me before. \nJohn stands up and goes to his dresser. \nJOHN Okay. Look. If it'll make you feel any better... \nHe takes a revolver from the dresser drawer and emphatically checks the action. Then he walks to his side of the bed and sets the pistol on his bedside table. \nJOHN I'll keep it right here beside me all night. You know I'm a light sleeper and a damn good shot. Are you satisfied? \nPause. Jill tries to smile. \nJILL John, I'm sorry to be putting you through all this. \nJOHN Hey, you're not putting me through anything that you don't have to go through yourself. I'm with you all the way. Trust me. Okay? \nJill nods. John leans forward and kisses her. \nJOHN That's my girl. \nHe gets up and walks out of the room talking. \nJOHN (O.S.) Now try to relax. We'll get some sleep. You'll be surprised how differently things will look in the morning. \nJILL (complaining) Honey... \nJOHN (O.S.) What? \nJILL Not so loud. You're going to wake the children. \nJohn comes back into the bedroom with a glass of water and a couple of pills in his hand. \nJOHN (smiling) Naw. Those kids'd sleep through an earthquake. They're good kids. (handing her the pills and water) Here, take a couple of these. They're just what the doctor ordered. \nCLOSEUP - JILL \nAs she takes the pills and swallows them, one at a time. \nJOHN (O.S.) You know, I read somewhere about this psychological thing called hysterical delusion or hysterical recall or something. It had to do with how an event from your past can sneak up on you sometimes and fool you when it's only just a memory. I don't know. We'll talk about it in the morning. Maybe there's someone we can see about that... \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nThe lounge area in the back of the station. At one table, three OFFICERS are playing bridge. Garber with his back to CAMERA rounds out their game. \nAt a nearby table closer to CAMERA, Policeman #1 is working on a crossword puzzle. POLICEMAN #3, sitting next to him, is reading a paperback novel. \nPOLICEMAN #1 What's a word for \"an outsider, of sorts\"? \nINT. LOCKHART HOUSE - NIGHT \nA shot of the downstairs hall. All is dark and still, very still. \nINT. BEDROOM \nJill is tossing in her sleep. John is fast asleep next to her, on his side facing away from her. Then, Jill wakes up. She is heavily sedated, groggy. She hardly knows where she is at first. \nShe pulls herself up to a sitting position on the side of the bed. She tries to gather her wits. Then she gets up and walks slowly out of the room. \nFOLLOWING JILL \nThrough the upstairs hallway, down the staircase and toward the kitchen. The darkness around her is ominous, threatening. \nShe stops at the dining room window and looks out. On the street a patrol car slowly passes and disappears down the block. \nINT. KITCHEN \nJill enters, turns on the light, opens a cupboard and takes out a glass. She goes to the refrigerator and opens it. Suddenly, the lights go out. \nJill closes the refrigerator door and goes and turns on another light. Apparently, only a lightbulb has blown. Jill unscrews the burned-out bulb from its socket and throws it in the trash. \nShe leaves the kitchen. \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL \nJill walks to a hall closet and opens it. A light comes on inside as she does so. A puzzled, half-startled expression comes onto her face. \nJILL'S POV \nInside the closet, half the hangers with coats, etc., are on the floor. \nSound over: A telephone being dialed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLIFFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nClifford has just finished dialing the phone. He waits, nothing happens. Then a strange, siren-like noise comes out of the telephone. Clifford listens, then hangs up. \nHe picks up the .38 he has lying on the desk and idly starts flipping the cartridge chamber with one of his jimmy needles. After a moment, he lays the gun down and picks up the phone again, this time calling the OPERATOR. \nOPERATOR (O.S.) Operator. \nCLIFFORD Can you dial a local number for me? \nOPERATOR (O.S.) What is the number, please? \nCLIFFORD \nThe operator dials. There is a pause. Then the same strange noise cuts in. \nCLIFFORD Operator, what does that mean? \nOPERATOR (O.S.) I'm sorry, sir, that line seems to be disconnected. \nCLIFFORD Why don't I get a recording? \nOPERATOR (O.S.) I don't know, sir. Maybe the number was just recently disconnected. Maybe there's a temporary malfunction in the wiring. Why don't you try it again in the morning? \nCLIFFORD Yeah, okay. Thanks. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOCKHART HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nJill is walking down the hall to the children's bedroom. She opens the door. \nINT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM \nAs Jill quietly enters. The children are asleep. Jill goes to June and tucks her in. Then she walks over to Stevie's bed. He is sleeping, but with a Sugar Daddy in his hand. Jill looks down at him, again puzzled. She leans over, takes the Sugar Daddy and gently wakes him. \nJILL Stevie... Stevie... \n", "test1_input": "WHEN A STRANGER CALLS \nWritten by \nSteve Feke and Fred Walton \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT \nA quiet upper-middle class neighborhood. The CAMERA is at the curb, looking down the street. There are no sidewalks. Trees arch overhead. CICADAS drone on the soundtrack. \nThe OPENING TITLES briefly FADE IN and OUT, framed by the trees on either side of the street. Footsteps are heard approaching. \nAs the picture TITLE FADES, out of the dark emerges a GIRL 17 years old, carrying schoolbooks. This is JILL. CAMERA PANS with her ninety degrees as she comes to the front of a house and stops. \nLights are on in the bottom half of the house, and the curtains across the windows are open. A single light burns in the upper right side of the house, presumable in a bedroom, but the curtains in the room are drawn. \nA scene TITLE appears on the lower half of the screen: \n8 pm Tuesday, March 23, 1971 \nThe TITLE FADES, and Jill heads up the walk to the front door of the house. \nThe light in the upper floor of the house is turned off. \nINT. HOUSE - FRONT HALL \nA middle-aged DOCTOR is standing at the foot of the stairs. His WIFE is descending the stairs, putting on her earrings. She is in an obvious hurry. \nWIFE Where's the girl? \nDOCTOR I only called her ten minutes ago -- \nWIFE (passing into living room) I made our reservation for 8:15. We're going to be late. \nThe doorbell rings. \nDOCTOR Here she is now. \nHe crosses to the front door and opens it. The girl smiles at him uncomfortably from outside. \nJILL Dr. Minakis? \nDOCTOR Mandrakis. It's okay. Everyone gets it wrong the first time. You're Jill? Come on in. \nJILL (entering) Thank you. \nThe wife comes back into the front hall. \nWIFE I've written the number of the restaurant on the notepad by the phone. (to Doctor) Zip me up, will you please? (to Jill) If we aren't home in two hours, it means we've decided to go on to a movie and won't be back until after midnight. Is that all right? \nJILL Sure. \nDOCTOR (helping wife on with her coat) I've told my service to pick up any calls coming in to my office phone. \nWIFE The children are asleep upstairs -- first door on your left at the top of the landing. They're both just getting over a cold -- so try not to wake them. \nJILL Okay. \nWIFE Do you have any questions? \nJill shakes her head. \nWIFE We have to go now. We're late. \nThey cross to the front door and begin to exit. \nDOCTOR Make yourself at home. The refrigerator's loaded. \nWIFE (pulling doctor through the door) Goodbye. \n", "test1_true": "DOCTOR We even have some low-fat yogurt. \nWIFE (O.S.) Will you please come on! \nDOCTOR Bye. \nThe doctor pulls the door shut behind him. Jill turns toward the living room. Pause. She walks into the living room and sets her books down on a table with the telephone on it. \nO.S. we hear the car doors close, the engine start up, then the car backing out the driveway and heading down the street. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM - LATER \nIt is dark. O.S. we hear the phone in the living room being lifted off its receiver, a dial tone, then a number is dialed. Pause, then ringing. CAMERA SLOWLY DOLLIES from the dining room, across the front hall and into the living room where we see Jill talking over the phone to a girlfriend, NANCY. \nNANCY (O.S.) Hello? \nJILL Nancy? \nNANCY (O.S.) Hello, Jill? How's it going? (out of phone) I got it, Dad! (beat) Father! (into phone again) Jesus Christ! My father's in one of his moods again. Male menopause, you know. So how are you? \nJILL All right. \nNANCY (O.S.) Are you over at Dr. Mandrakis'? \nJILL Yeah, I've been here for about an hour already. \nNANCY (O.S.) Isn't it a neat house? \nJILL I guess... I haven't looked around very much. \nNANCY (O.S.) Did you see his kids? \nJILL No, they were asleep when I got here. \nNANCY (O.S.) They're really cute. So what can I do for you? \nJILL You didn't happen to talk to Billy today, did you? \nNANCY (O.S.) Yeah, I talked to him. \nJILL Did he say anything about me? \nPause. \nNANCY (O.S.) I don't know what you did to him, or said to him, or what... but he's really pissed off at you! What did you do? \nJILL It's what I didn't do. \nNANCY (O.S.) (sarcastic) Yeah, I can imagine. \nJILL Do me a favor, Nance. \nNANCY (O.S.) What. \nJILL Do you think you'll be talking with Billy some time tonight? \nNANCY (O.S.) Prabably. I'm going to the library in a few minutes. I just have to get out of this house! (beat) Hey! Why don't Billy and I come over there? He'll come along if I tell him to. \nJILL That isn't what I had in mind. \nNANCY (O.S.) You'll be safe with Billy. I'll be there. Come on. \nJILL Nancy, all you want to do is come over here and get drunk. \nNANCY (O.S.) Who? Me? \nJILL (mimicking) Who? Me? \nNANCY (O.S.) You want to see Billy, don't you?! \n", "test2_input": "BILL See ya 'round. \nHe turns and strides out of the bar. \nCAMERA HOLDS for a beat on Hank alone now in his empty establishment. The phone starts to ring, presumably the police calling back. \nAfter several rings, Hank picks up the phone and listens. \nHANK (into phone) No, it's over now... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LT. GARBER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAll the lights are out inside the house, but we should just be able to see that we are in the hall, looking at the front door. Footsteps approach on the walk outside. A key slips into the lock... \nInside the house we can hear faint whispering. Someone is moving about in the darkness. Then the door swings open and the shadowy figure of a MAN crosses the threshold. He stops just inside. \nMAN (calling out) Donna. Donna! Hey! (under his breath) What the hell -- ! \nSuddenly the lights come on and a chorus of voices cry out, \"SURPRISE!\" \nA broad smile breaks across the man's face. We may recognize him as the cop from six years ago -- Charles Garber. Today he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for work, usually in slacks, turtleneck and jacket. \nGARBER (genuinely surprised) What is all this?! \nSCATTERED VOICES Happy birthday, Charlie! \nGarber looks sheepishly at his hand holding the pistol he'd drawn just before the lights came up. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Look at him! \nMAN'S VOICE Don't shoot us, Charlie! \nGARBER (chagrined) How was I supposed to know? \nEverybody starts to laugh, including Garber as he returns the pistol to his shoulder holster. \nANGLE ON DONNA \nGarber's wife. She comes out of the kitchen carrying a birthday cake with lit candles and makes her way through the crowd of GUESTS singing \"Happy Birthday\". \nEveryone joins in as Donna moves forward and stands beside her husband. Clifford is one of the guests. He has his arm around a young BLOND who is sort of pretty despite her tacky/plastic appearance. \nWhen the song is over, Garber blows out the candles and hugs and kisses his wife. Everybody cheers. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GARBER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER \nThe party is still in full swing. Garber is following Clifford up the stairs. They are both fairly loaded by now. \nGarber, in particular, has reached that stage of inebriation where standing still is pretty hard to do. \nGARBER Will you tell me what this is about, Cliff? \nCLIFFORD Yeah, in a minute. \nGARBER I don't think I can take any more of these surprises. \nINT. A BEDROOM \nAs Clifford and Garber enter. Garber turns on a light as Clifford closes the door, shutting out the sounds of the party below. \nGARBER Okay now, what's the big deal? \nCLIFFORD Stand still. I want you to remember this in the morning. \nGARBER If you want me to remember something in the morning, then tell it to me in the morning. \nGarber half comically turns to go. Clifford stops him. \nCLIFFORD Charlie, come on. \n", "test2_true": "A BABY between a year and two years old is lying in a crib. It opens its eyes and starts looking around. \nGARBER (O.S.) All right, all right. What is it? You're getting married. \nCLIFFORD No. I got a job today, tracking someone. \nTWO SHOT - CLIFFORD & GARBER \nGarber, still moving restlessly, pats his friend on the shoulder. \nGARBER That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll find your man. \nCLIFFORD It's Curt Duncan. \nGarber stops suddenly, stunned. In an instant, he has become stone sober. \nGARBER What? \nANGLE ON BABY \nKicking and wiggling about. \nCLIFFORD (O.S.) You didn't know he got out? \nThe baby opens its mouth and starts to cry. \nTWO SHOT - CLIFFORD & GARBER \nGarber glances over his shoulder at the baby, then turns back to Clifford. \nCLIFFORD I need your cooperation on this one. \nGARBER Sure. Anything. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nIt is late. The block is virtually deserted. Across the street is the exterior of a bar -- the same bar Duncan was in earlier. Some PEOPLE are coming out of the bar. It must be near closing time. The people turn left and walk away down the sidewalk. Their voices diminish. Pause. \nA car passes. Then the door to the bar opens again and a woman comes out onto the sidewalk. It is Tracy. She turns to the right and starts to walk away. \nCLOSEUP - DUNCAN \nHe is standing in shadows across the street, watching her. \nEXT. TRACY ON STREET - NIGHT \nA series of shots of Tracy walking home. The CAMERA remains consistently behind her or off to one side, sometimes DOLLYING with her behind a row of parked cars, sometimes picking up her passing reflection in a darkened store window. \nThe impression this gives is unmistakable. Curt Duncan is following her. We do not see him, we do not hear him, yet we know he is there. Often we can sense that the very angle from which we see Tracy is his POV. \nBut Tracy is aware of nothing. We know this when the CAMERA begins to move in front of her, once more becoming an impersonal observer of her walk homeward, to safety. \nTension mounts as we start to expect that Duncan will jump out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes. But he doesn't. \nFinally, Tracy walks up to the CAMERA at the end of a block and turns a corner; but the CAMERA HOLDS on the dark street she has just come up. We hear a cough which confirms that Duncan is lurking somewhere in the shadows. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nTracy walks up the steps and enters the apartment. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING \nTracy steps into the elevator. The doors close. CAMERA HOLDS on the elevator and watches the lights above it travel from one to six. \nO.S. we hear the door to the apartment building open and close. \nINT. SIXTH FLOOR \nTracy steps out of the elevator and walks down the hall to her door. She fumbles through her purse for keys, then bends over the lock to let herself in. \n", "test3_input": "The mother turns around. It is Jill Johnson! \nJILL (smiling) Well, look what the wind blew in! \nCAMERA MOVES IN on her as she comes forward, bends down, kisses Stevie, and picks up June. Jill looks older, more mature, but still very pretty. She is Mrs. John Lockhart now, and has left her memories of the past behind her. \nSTEVIE Mommy, what's for dinner? Could we have hamburgers? \nJILL (teasing) Is that all you ever want? \nA wall phone in the kitchen starts to ring. Stevie goes to answer it. \nSTEVIE Hello? \nJOHN (O.S.) (surprised) Hey, how's my little tiger? \nIt is JOHN LOCKHART on the phone. \nSTEVIE Daddy, Junie threw my baseball down the street; and I can't find it! \nJOHN (O.S.) Well, we'll look for it real hard later. Let me talk to mommy. \nJill, by this time, has come to the phone. She is still holding June. \nSTEVIE Okay. Bye, daddy. \nStevie hands the phone to Jill. \nJILL Hi. \nJOHN Hi, babe -- whaddya say you put on a sexy dress, and I take you out to dinner tonight? \nJill is very happy about this. \nJILL Great... what's the occasion? \nJOHN (teasing) Just a little surprise. \nJILL What? \nJOHN I'm leaving here now; be home in half an hour. \nJILL Okay, see ya. \nJOHN Bye, babe. \nAs Jill hangs up the phone, Stevie pipes up O.S. \nSTEVIE (O.S.) Mommy, is Daddy gonna get me a new baseball? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DR. MANDRAKIS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nClifford's car is parked in the driveway, and we see him getting out. He goes to the front door -- the porch light is on and perhaps one other lamp somewhere inside the otherwise dark house. He rings the bell, waits, rings again... \nFinally the door is opened by the Houseboy. \nHOUSEBOY Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis are out of town. \nCLIFFORD For how long? \nHOUSEBOY Three more weeks. \nPause. \nCLIFFORD It's just as well. Will you be here? \nHOUSEBOY Yes. \nClifford takes a business card from his pocket and gives it to the Houseboy. \nCLIFFORD Here. Call if you need me. \n", "test3_true": "Clifford pauses beside his car for a moment, looking back at the rich, dark home. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JILL'S HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe children are in bed. Jill is sitting next to Stevie. Only a nightlight is on. \nSTEVIE ...I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. God bless Mommy and Daddy and... \nJUNE And me. \nSTEVIE ...and Granmom and Aunt Lucy and Uncle George... \nJUNE And me! \nSTEVIE (pausing) ...and her. Now will you tell us a story? \nJILL No, I will not tell you a story. You go to sleep now. And be good. Carol will be here while we're gone. \nSTEVIE Goodnight. \nJill kisses him. \nJUNE Mommy, will you come here a minute? I want to tell you something. \nJill stands up and goes over to June's bed. \nJILL What is it? \nJUNE Come closer. \nJill bends closer to her daughter. O.S. the doorbell rings. \nJUNE I love you. \nJILL I love you, too, Junebug. (kissing her) Goodnight. Sleep tight. \nJill stands up and leaves. \nINT. FRONT HALL \nAs Jill comes down the stairs. CAROL, the sitter, is at the foot of the stairs with John. Carol has an armful of schoolbooks. \nJILL Hi, Carol. \nCAROL Hello, Mrs. Lockhart. I saw your picture in the paper the other day. Congratulations. \nJILL Ugggh... wasn't it a dreadful picture? \nJOHN I thought it was nice. \nJill crosses to a hall table, picks up a phone book, flips through it, then writes on a notepad beside the phone. Over this action... \nJOHN Are the kids asleep? \nJILL They will be soon. (to Carol) Give them about twenty minutes and then take a peek -- but if Stevie sees you, you'll have to tell him a story. (beat) Here's the number of the restaurant. Call us if you need us. For police, ambulance, any emergency like that, just dial 911. You know that, right? \nCAROL Nine-one-one? Oh, sure. \nJILL And just in case, I've written the number of the children's Uncle George and Aunt Lucy here, too. \nJOHN Honey, in ten seconds I eat the staircase. \nJILL Okay. Okay. \nShe puts down the pad and crosses to a closet where she takes out a lightweight coat. \nJILL (handing the coat to John) Here. \nJOHN (not taking the coat) I'm not wearing that thing! \n"}

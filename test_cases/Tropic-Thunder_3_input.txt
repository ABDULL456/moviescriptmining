CUT TO: 
Tropic Thunder 28. 
EXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE -- NIGHT 
It is an APOCALYPSE NOW theme party. Vegas style. Tiki torches,, buffets. PLAYBOY PLAYMATE DANCERS circa 1967 are dancing on a deck in front of a banner that reads "ONE WEEK DOWN!". The crew and cast are partying their asses off. i n ï¿½ï¿½ i nMï¿½'al WAITERS, dressed like bald Marlon Brandos in full face camo, serve hors d'oeuvres. PORTNOY, not looking very sober, jumps up on the stage with the dancers and starts doing a striptease. 
ENTRANCE TO THE DECK Damien walks in, watching this scene from Caligula going down. He looks in a deep funk. Portnoy STAGE DIVES straight onto the lawn, landing with a thud in front of Damien. 
DAMIEN, Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to talk -- as.a cast, as a platoon, right now. 
PORTNOY (sick and drunk) Dorfie-- did you happenito see that grip withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was supposed to meet him here. He has a- package of mine. Kevin Sandusky ("Brooklyn" from the movie) comes up to them, looking fresh faced and eager. 
SANDUSKY. Hey Mr. Dorfman. Jeff. You O.K? That was some hit you took today. 
PORTNOY 
(BEAT) Who are you? 
SANDUSKY I'm Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin Sandusky? I'm playing Brooklyn? 
Tropic Thunder 29. 
PORTNOY Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that grip with the bandana? 
SANDUSKY Uh, no. I think-- But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug connection. They both watch him go. 
SANDUSKY Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find you. I know this is a party, but this afternoon after work I was breaking down my M-16, and I have to say, in the night watch scene, a minute and a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble it. 
DAMIEN 
(TOUCHED) You actually care, don't you? 
SANDUSKY Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge opportunity. To be working with all these great actors, and you. 
DAMIEN You're the only one who auditioned. You're the only one who did the two week boot camp, Sandusky. 
SANDUSKY Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird. Wasn't the point that we were all supposed to bond? 
DAMIEN 
(BITTERLY) Yes, that was the point. Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it. We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of food. Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS who is deeply uninterested. 
I 
I r Tropic Thunder 30. 
SPEEDMAN I guess I just watched some retarded people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time. with them... watching them.. Watching all the retarded stuff they did. 
LAZARUS Huh, I always found mere observation a little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram the source of the pain. Then live it. 
SPEEDMAN (trying. to keep up) Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the first time in-my life.. (searches for the word) Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer, retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth retarded. In a `weird way I had to unlearn what it was to be... .NOT retarded. 
LAZARUS Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded. So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman is lost: 
SPEEDMAN About what? 
LAZARUS (with 'a chuckle) Are you serious? Everyone knows you don't ever go fully retarded! 
SPEEDMAN How do you mean? Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session.

EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
Lowell, waiting with the other journalists... 
PHOTOGRAPHER Got any idea what's going on in there? 
LOWELL No, I don't have a clue. 
INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
Motley still conducting the inquiry...  And the tobacco lawyers, like a pack of dogs, waiting to pounce... 
WIGAND That is correct. 
MOTLEY In other words, it acts as a drug? 
TOBACCO LAWYER Object to the form of the question! 
MOTLEY It acts as a drug on the body? 
TOBACCO LAWYER Object to the form! 
MOTLEY It acts as a... 
TOBACCO LAWYER Object! 
MOTLEY There an echo in here?  Your objection's been recorded.  She typed it into her little machine over there.  It's on the record.  So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness.  Does it act as a drug? 
TOBACCO LAWYER (shouts) Dr. Wigand.  I am instructing you... (to Wigand) ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.  And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky!  That means you don't talk! (beat) Mr. Motley, we have rights, here... 
MOTLEY (explodes) Oh, you got rights and lefts!  Ups and downs and middles!  So what?!  You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky.  This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding.  Wipe that smirk off your face!  Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record.  And I'm going to take my witness' testimony!  Whether the hell you like it or not! (to Wigand) Answer the question, Dr... 
WIGAND (slams it home) Yes.  It produces a physiological response, which meets the definition of a drug!  Nicotine is associated with impact, with satisfaction.  It has a pharmacological effect that crosses the blood-brain barrier intact... 
MOTLEY Thank you, Doctor.  Thank you. 
EXT. THE SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - NIGHT 
Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain.  There's a slight sound.  He turns.  And Jeffrey's come outside.  He stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain and windswept trees.  They're quiet.  They share a look. They nod to each other.  The smallest nod of accomplishment. And they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in Pascagoula, Mississippi. 
INT. CBS EDITING ROOM, NEW YORK - AFTERNOON 
We see Lowell, unusually buoyant in the same clothes as yesterday.  He's working with Tony Baldo on a cut of the show, the net result of his architecture of events, his combination of persuasion and integrity... 
We see on the Avid monitor a single of Jeffrey... 
WIGAND (on monitor) "Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..." 
LOWELL Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive."  Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..."  Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath.  Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side... 
Widen to include Debbie DeLuca, the Intern, two other Editors, Felling.  They have gathered behind Lowell in the doorway.  This is a hot show and it's generated excitement among Lowell's co-workers.  And while Baldo cuts, we see... 
INT. CBS, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EDITING ROOM - DAY 
...the group has spilled out the doorway, watching Lowell's story come together.  Beyond them, approaching, is Mike Wallace, coming to work... 
BILL FELLING (leaving) ...helluva show, Mike.  Explosive material. 
People separate as Mike pushes in.  Lowell sees Mike.  While Tony Baldo is making the edits on the Avid... 
LOWELL (to Mike) It went great in Mississippi, Mike. 
MIKE WALLACE Good. 
Don Hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket. 
DON HEWITT I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed. 
LOWELL Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world. (seriously) "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive. 
MIKE WALLACE I like that... 
DON HEWITT Corporate has some questions.  We've got a meeting at Black Rock first thing in the morning. 
LOWELL When's the air date? 
DEBBIE DELUCA (to Lowell) Excuse me, Lowell.  Sharon's on line 3. 
LOWELL Tell her I'll call her back in ten. 
BALDO Here we go.

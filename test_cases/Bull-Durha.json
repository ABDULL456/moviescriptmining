{"train": "\"BULL DURHAM\" \nby \nRon Shelton \nIn baseball, you don't know nothing. \n--Yogi Berra \nWhoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball. \n--Jacques Barzun \nYou could look it up. \n--Casey Stengel \nTitles over -- \nFADE IN: \nA series of still photos. Black and white. Ancient. \nBABE RUTH SWINGS -- An icon of American history. His giant upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet. The huge bat in an elegant follow-through... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTY COBB ROUNDS THIRD -- The most vicious ballplayer of them all, a balletic whirling dervish. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nJACKIE ROBINSON STEALS ROME -- Yogi Berra applies the tag. Too late. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nJOE DIMAGGIO WITH HIS SON in the Yankee clubhouse. Walking down the runway, Joe in uniform. Number five. \nPULLBACK REVEALS: \nA WALL COVERED WITH BASEBALL PICTURES behind a small table covered with objects and lit candles. A baseball, an old baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar -- also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora Duncan. Clearly, the arrangement is -- A SHRINE -- And it glows with the candles like some religious altar. \nWe hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent. \nANNIE (V.O.) I believe in the Church of Baseball. (beat) I've tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones -- I've worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and Isadora Duncan... \nPAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room. Late afternoon light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a small dressing table. A WOMAN applies make up. \nANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face. Very pretty, knowing, outwardly confident. Words flow from her Southern lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern, National and International borders. She's cosmic. \nANNIE (V.O.) I know things. For instance -- (beat) There are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary. And -- (beat) There are 108 stitches in a baseball. (beat) When I learned that, I gave Jesus a chance. (beat) But it just didn't work out between us. The Lord laid too much guilt on me. I prefer metaphysics to theology. (beat) You see, there's no guilt in baseball... and it's never boring. \nANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the door. She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps. She sits on a bench and \nANNIE Which makes it like sex. (beat) There's never been a ballplayer slept with me who didn't have the best year of his career. (beat) Making love is like hitting a baseball -- you just got to relax and concentrate. \nANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up her calves as she does. \nANNIE Besides, I'd never sleep with a player hitting under .250 unless he had a lot of R.B.I.'s or was a great glove man up the middle. (beat) A woman's got to have standards. \nSHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side. Like a little girl showing off her new shoes. \nANNIE The young players start off full of enthusiasm and energy but they don't realize that come July and August when the weather is hot it's hard to perform at your peak level. (beat) The veterans pace themselves better. They finish stronger. They're great in September. (beat) While I don't believe a woman needs a man to be fulfilled, I do confess an interest in finding the ultimate guy -- he'd have that youthful exuberance but the veteran's sense of timing... \nANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick. \nANNIE Y'see there's a certain amount of \"life-wisdom\" I give these boys. (beat) I can expand their minds. Sometimes when I've got a ballplayer alone I'll just read Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman to him. The guys are so sweet -- they always stay and listen. (beat) Of course a guy will listen to anything if he thinks it's foreplay. \nANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly, in her cleavage. \nANNIE I make then feel confident. They make me feel safe. And pretty. \nANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress along her hips. And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses. Stylish and slightly mad. \nANNIE What I give them lasts a life-time. What they give me lasts 142 games. Sometimes it seems like a bad trade. (quickly rebounding) But bad trades are part of baseball -- who can forget Frank Robinson or Milt Pappas, for Godsakes! (beat) It's a long season and you got to trust it. \nANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DUSK \nA frame house with porch and lots of trees -- a Thomas Wolfe house... with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway. \nANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic, old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood. In the b.g. other people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head. \nANNIE I've tried them all -- I really have -- (beat) and the only church that truly feeds the soul -- day in, day out -- is the Church of Baseball. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CHURCH -- DURHAM BASEBALL PARK -- DUSK \nNow visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium carved into the center of an old Tobacco town. \nPeople are arriving on foot from all around... \n\"Rock Around the Clock\" by Bill Haley fills the air. \nANNIE LOOKS THROUGH HER BINOCULARS -- Studying the players warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his act. \nP.O.V. A LATIN PLAYER PLAYING PEPPER. \nANNIE Number twenty-two's thighs are just great. Who's he? \nJACKSON (reading the program) Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year. \nANNIE Three-fourteen? Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson. \nBACK TO MAX PATKIN -- He finishes his routine. \nRECORDING OVER P.A. Gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight. \nINT.  PRESS BOX -- NIGHT \nCUT TO: \nA WOMAN ANNOUNCER, MARYLOU, 30, speaks into the P.A. mike. \nANNOUNCER Let's hear it for Max Patkin -- \nApplause as Patkin takes his bows, leaves the field, shakes hands with a the BULL MASCOT LEADING THE APPLAUSE. \nANNOUNCER \"The Greatest Show on Dirt\" -- your own Durham Bulls! \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE DUGOUT \nCLOSE ON ANOTHER PLAYER -- MICKEY MCFEE, 23, black. Smoking a cigarette -- always smoking a cigarette. He snuffs out his cigarette and RUNS onto the field with the rest of the team, as -- \nEBBY ENTERS THE DUGOUT from the runway. Larry and Skip encourage their players running onto the field. Ebby is trying to get the zipper on his fly unstuck. He smiles broadly at Skip and Larry, and grabs his glove. \nEBBY I'm there, Skip, I'm ready. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE PRESS BOX \nTHE RADIO ANNOUNCER, TEDDY CULLINANE, 50, leans into the radio mike of a very small local station. Next to him is the local SPORTSWRITER, WHITEY SHERRARD, 40. Between them they've seen a million minor league players come and go. \nWHITEY Is this guy LaLoosh worth a hundred grand? I hear he's a quart low? \nTEDDY THE RADIO MAN (covering the mike) He's left handed. Whattya expect? (on the air) The Bulls are off to a slow start having dropped their first three games, but hope to turn it around tonight with the professional debut of the heralded young left hander, Ebby Calvin LaLoosh. (beat) Stepping in for the Peninsula White Sox is leadoff hitter Willie Foster \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE BALLFIELD -- NIGHT \nANGLE TO ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- Millie has joined Annie and Jackson. Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for wisdom and insight. \nANNIE -- Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse. It'll just get everybody in trouble. \nMILLIE I got lured. \nANNIE You didn't get \"lured\". Women never get lured. They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it -- \"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions\". \nMILLIE \"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions\". \nANNIE That's better. (to Jackson) Got the radar ready? \nJACKSON Ready. \nJACKSON AIMS A RADAR GUN at the plate. \nTHE PENINSULA WHITE SOX LEADOFF HITTER steps in. \nTEDDY THE RADIO MAN (V.O.) The word on LaLoosh is that the good looking young lefty has a major league fastball but sometimes has problems with his control. \nEBBY CALVIN LALOOSH WINDS UP and fires. The pitch sails over the batter's head, over the catcher's head, over the backstop, and CRASHES INTO THE PRESS BOX. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  THE PRESS BOX \nTHE ANNOUNCER AND SPORTSWRITER CRASH to the floor as the ball smashes into their booth. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE DUGOUT \nSKIP SPITS TOBACCO, mumbles flatly to Larry. \nSKIP Little high. \nLARRY (shouts to EBBY) C'mon big 'un, you're okay... \nANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- She turns to Jackson. \nJACKSON Ninety-five miles an hour. \nANNIE He looks great, just great! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE PITCHER'S MOUND \nSKIP Struck out eighteen... \nLARRY League record. (beat) And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice -- also league records -- (beat) Joe, the guy's got some serious shit. \nTHE DOOR OPENS -- A PLAYER ENTERS, in street clothes, carrying his suitcases. CRASH DAVIS, 30, older than the other players. And different. More than just opinions, he actually has a point of view. A career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever he can get a job. Unlike Ebby -- Crash knows a lot about the world without baseball. Also unlike Ebby -- he loves baseball desperately. \nLARRY Who're you? \nCrash speaks slowly, with a trace of cynicism and pride, like an old warrior who knows he's just a hired gun. \nCRASH I am the player to be named later. \nBeat. Skip looks out, half dressed, from his cubicle. \nSKIP Crash Davis? \nCRASH The Crash Davis. (beat, then nonstop) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3 -- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear. \nLARRY (remembering) Oh yeah. I shoulda throwed a slider. Damn, Crash, how're ya? \nSKIP I'm Joe Riggins. Sit down \nCRASH I'm too old for this shit. Why the hell am I back in \"A\" ball? \nSKIP 'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh. (beat) The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him -- \nLARRY He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head. \nSKIP -- we had the gun on him tonight -- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97. (beat) He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years. \nLARRY But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean... \nSKIP You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes -- (beat) We want you to mature the kid. \nCRASH \"Mature\" ain't a fuckin' verb. \nLARRY You go to college or what? \nSKIP We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year. (beat) He can go all the way. \nCRASH And where can I go? \nSKIP You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it. (beat) Beats hell outta working at Sears. \nLARRY Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once. Sold Lady Kenmores -- it's nasty, nasty work. \nSKIP Even if it's the Carolina League -- this is a chance to play everyday. \nCRASH (angrily) You don't want a player, you want a stable pony. My Triple A contract gets bought out so I can hold the Flavor o' the Month's dick in the bus leagues?! (angrily) Fuck this fucking game... I fuckin' quit. \nCRASH RISES TO LEAVE -- Picks up his luggage, and turns to Skip and Larry before exiting. A deep breath \nCRASH Who we play tomorrow? \nBeat. They know, they share the inability to quit the game. They're all clinging to the Church of Baseball. \nSKIP Winston-Salem. Batting practice at \nCRASH LEAVES and as he does -- Ed (the catcher) enters. \nED You wanted to see me? \nSKIP Yeah, Ed, shut the door... \nHe does. Remains standing. He can see it coming. \nSKIP This is the toughest job a manager has, Ed... (deep breath) But the organization has decided to make a change -- we're releasing you from your contract... \nCLOSE ON ED -- Silent. Motionless. Empty. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE LOCKER ROOM -- \nCRASH PUTS HIS BAG IN A LOCKER as other players return from the shower. Crash watches as EBBY SOAKS HIS ELBOW IN A TUB OF ICE WATER as the sports writer, Whitey, interviews him. \nWHITEY How's it feel to get your first professional win? \nEBBY It feels \"out there\". A major rush. I mean it doesn't just feel \"out there\" but it feels out there. \nCRASH Hopeless. Utterly fucking hopeless. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT \nLoud country music in the players' hangout and pickup spot. It's full of players and lots of young women. \nMILLIE SITS DOWN NEXT TO YET ANOTHER PLAYER, TONY, 25 -- He's slick, urban, smooth. \nMILLIE Hi, I'm Millie. \nTONY I'm Tony. I play left field. \nMILLIE I know. \nANNIE SITS IN THE CORNER at her own table. Max Patkin, looking spiffy in a turtle neck sweater and double breasted blazer, sits down next to her. Old friends. \nCRASH From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot \nEBBY Don't try me. \nCRASH Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest. \nEBBY No way. \nCRASH C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh. (teasing mercilessly) C'mon, Rook -- show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head -- \nEBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away, right at Crash's chest. But, alas -- \nTHE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance. Crash never blinks. \nCRASH Ball four. \nEBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him. \nEBBY Who the fuck are you?! \nCRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed, effortless. And brutal. BANG! Ebby goes down. And stays there stunned. He looks up. \nCRASH I'm Crash Davis. Your new catcher. And you just got Lesson Number One -- \"Don't think -- it can only hurt the ballclub\". (beat) Buy ya a drink? \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CLUB -- NIGHT \nANNIE AND MAX DANCE to Billy Eckstein on the juke box. Millie and Tony are also on the dance floor. \nECKSTEIN (on juke box) April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom, Holiday tables under the tree... \nEBBY AND CRASH WATCH FROM THE CORNER TABLE -- Ebby's right eye is blackened. He holds a drink on it. \nEBBY We fight, she gets the clown -- how's that happen? \nCRASH Shut up -- I like this song... (sings along) April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve... \nEBBY She's playing with my mind. \nCRASH It's a damn easy thing to play with. \nANNIE SUDDENLY APPEARS at the table. \nANNIE Well -- you boys stopped fighting yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love a little macho male bonding -- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being \"re- channeled\" but I believe in \"re- channeling\" so who cares, right? (beat) Shall we go to my place? \nEBBY Which one of us? \nANNIE Oh both of you, of course... \nCLOSE ON EBBY -- His eyes full of fear and wonder. \nCLOSE ON CRASH -- He smiles. \nTHE THREE OF THEM LEAVE the bar together. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nTHE SHRINE OF BASEBALL GLOWS -- Annie lights the candles. \nEBBY AND CRASH SIT ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF HER COUCH -- Both men look around the room with wonder. Ebby is clearly more nervous than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor league career. \nANNIE These are the ground rules. (beat) I hook up with one guy a season -- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring training... (beat) And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far. (beat) So... I thought we should get to know each other. \nCRASH Why do you get to choose? Why don't I get to choose? \nANNIE Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction. There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart. \nEBBY Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what? \nANNIE You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey -- slow down. \nCrash rises to leave, and heads for the door. \nCRASH After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout. Besides -- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart... or loins. \nANNIE (challenging him) What do you believe in? \nCrash at the door. Annie's question is slightly taunting. He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion: \nCRASH I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap. (beat) I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the \"sweet spot\", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days. \nANNIE (breathless) Oh my... (softly) Don't leave... \nCRASH G'night. \nCrash heads out into the night. Annie hurries to the-door while Ebby sits on the couch, bewildered. \nEBBY Hey -- what's all this molecule stuff? \nANNIE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY -- Crash is on the porch. \nANNIE Wait, Crash -- don't go -- all I want is a date. I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'. \nCRASH I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy. \nCLOSE ON CRASH'S EYES -- Studying the \"pitches\" with intense concentration, endlessly working on his game. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE DURHAM FIELD -- NEXT DAY \nLARRY, DEKE, MICKEY AND BOBBY ARE SINGING at home plate as a pre-game show. Larry is Diana Ross, the other three are the Supremes, and the routine is brilliantly tacky. \nLARRY (AND THE SUPREMES) Baby love, oh oh, baby love, I need ya oh how I need ya, All ya do is treat me bad, Take my heart and leave me sad... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DURHAM BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- DAY \nJIMMY STANDS ON A BENCH trying to get the players' attention. \nJIMMY Listen up, guys, could I have your attention a minute? (a few heads turn) I'm going to be leading a daily chapel service at three in the afternoons here in the locker room and you're all invited to drop by and worship before batting practice. \nBOBBY Jimmy, God damn it -- loosen up and get laid. \nBOBBY, 25, smooths the creases of his uniform, preening. \nJIMMY I don't care If you think I'm square but I believe what I believe. \nAll heads turn as: \nEBBY ENTERS THE LOCKER ROOM -- He looks trashed. \nBOBBY Jesus, Ebby, what truck ran over you? \nEBBY (glassy eyed) Call me \"Nuke\". Annie said it's my new nickname. \nLots of teasing from around the clubhouse. \nDEKE Annie nailed you? That's great, means you're gonna have a helluva year. Does she fuck as good as they say? \nEBBY We didn't do it, man -- she read poetry to me all night, I swear. It's more tiring than fucking. \nEBBY GOES TO HIS LOCKER and starts undressing. Crash sits next to him, looking straight ahead. Bobby nearby. \nEBBY -- of love\"... hey, Crash, does that mean what I think it means? What's the deal here? \nCrash studies Ebby. \nCRASH Your shower shoes have fungus on 'em. You'll never get to the Bigs with fungus on your shower shoes. (beat) Think classy and you'll be classy. If you win 20 in the Show you can let the fungus grow back on your shower shoes and the press'll think you're colorful. (beat) Until you win twenty in the Show, however, it means you're a slob. \nCRASH RISES AND HEADS OUT to the field. Ebby sits silently, holding his shower shoes, taking it all in. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DURHAM BALLPARK -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- DAY \nIN THE DUGOUT -- THE GAME FROM A DUGOUT P.O.V. The players sit, stand, stir restlessly. A combination of relaxation and intensity not visible from the stands. \nCRASH IS HANDED HIS BAT and helmet by the bat boy. \nDEKE This guy's bringing some serious smoke out there. \nDUGOUT P.O.V. THE WINSTON-SALEM PITCHER throwing hard. \nCRASH He ain't got shit. \nFOLLOW CRASH INTO THE ON-DECK CIRCLE -- The ritual. The bat boy hands him the pine tar rag and he rubs pine tar on the bat with great care. \nCRASH RISES -- Heads to the plate. Talking to himself. \nCRASH You ain't getting that cheese by me, meat. \nCRASH TAKES HIS STANCE -- Upright. Calm. Head still. \nCRASH (V.O.) Look for the fastball up. He's gotta come with the cheese. Relax. Relax. Quick bat. Pop the clubhead. Open the hips. Relax. You're thinking too much. Get outta your fuckin' head, Crash. \nCLOSE ON CRASH'S FACE -- His eyes intensely focused. \nCRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER -- Starts his windup. \nCRASH (V.O.) Get on top of the ball. Quick bat. Don't let him in your kitchen -- \nTHE PITCHER DELIVERS -- Crash strides. Curveball. \nCrash swings and misses, offstride. Strike one. \nCRASH QUICKLY STEPS OUT OF THE BOX and picks up dirt. Rubs it on his hands. He's pissed. \nCRASH (V.O.) You stupid fuck, Crash. What're you swinging at a breaking ball for? Why's he starting me off with a hammer? Fuck me. (more dirt) You're okay. Stay back. Stay back, you dumb fuck. Wait. Wait. \nP.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT DELIVERY -- CURVE BALL AWAY. \nCRASH STRIDES INTO THE PITCH -- Lashes a line drive down the first base line. Just foul. \nCrash has started to first. Pulls up. Returns slowly to the plate. Picks up his bat. \nCRASH Throw that shit again, meat. Throw that weak ass shit. (beat) Now he's gotta try to slip the cheese by me. One and one. You're on top. Now bring me the gas -- \nP.O.V.  PITCHER'S THIRD DELIVERY -- High and tight. Right at Crash's head. The ball seems to accelerate. About to explode his skull. For a moment -- THE FEAR OF DEATH... \nCRASH HITS THE DIRT -- It just misses his head. \nANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another pitch. \nANNIE Damn. \nCRASH You're pulling your hips out. \nANNIE But they're nice hips. (beat) I looked up your records -- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great! \nANNIE FOULS ONE OFF and digs in gamely. \nCRASH Don't tell anybody. \nANNIE Why not? If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ! The record's... \nCRASH 247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it. \nANNIE Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it. \nCRASH No. Please. \nANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another one. \nANNIE Damn. \nCRASH Let me. \nCRASH STEPS IN TO HIT -- He takes his familiar stance. The pitch comes. Crash drills it. \nCRASH Your place or mine? \nANNIE Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao- Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous. \nCRASH Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around -- (whack -- a line drive) Great deal. You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing -- (whack -- a line drive) So what do you really want? You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic? (whack -- a line drive) Or do you want a guy? \nThe pitching machine arm flaps. Empty. Silence. \nANNIE Oh Crash... you do make speeches... \nCrash puts the bat down, heads out the gate. She follows. \nA LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ARRIVES -- Twenty-five 10 year olds in uniform with a couple PARENT COACHES. \nLITTLE LEAGUER #1 Hey, are you Crash Davis! Can I have a autograph?! \nCRASH STOPS TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS amidst 25 Little Leaguers. \nCRASH (as he signs autographs) Well, Annie, your place or mine? \nANNIE You got me all confused. \nCRASH A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing -- \nANNIE I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman. \nLITTLE LEAGUER Hey, when are you guys gonna start winning? You're terrible! \nANNIE It's a long season, boys. \nSUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche. \nNUKE Hey! (coming over) What're you guys doing here -- stealing my girl? \nCRASH Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that? (to the little leaguers) Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin \"Nuke\" LaLoosh. \nLITTLE LEAGUERS It's Nuke, it's Nuke! Can I have your autograph?! Etc. \nNUKE No prob, kids -- \nAnd suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers. Crash smiles as he turns Annie and the kids over to Nuke. \nCRASH See you guys at the ballpark. \nCrash leaves Annie with Nuke and 25 Little Leaguers. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CRASH GETS INTO HIS CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nAN AGING SHELBY MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- The paint's fading, a couple dings in the body, but loaded under the hood. \nCRASH PUNCHES HIS TAPE DECK -- Sam Cooke's \"You Send Me\". \nANNIE BITES HER FIST watching Crash leave. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- DAY \nThe sounds of lovemaking in a darkened room lit only by a few candles. \nANNIE Yes, yes, yesnmmmmyes... (beat) Oh my... (several beats) Oh, that was just fabulous, Crash. \nSeveral beats of silence. \nNUKE Crash? \nHe flips on a lamp near the bed. \nALL HEADS TURN, A HELICOPTER APPEARS ABOVE THE FIELD \nCUT TO: \nBACK TO THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL -- Hair and hats blowing from the chopper turbulence. \nMAYOR ...five, four, three, two, one... let 'er go! One thousand big ones! \nTHE HELICOPTER DUMPS HUNDREDS OF DOLLAR BILLS above the field. \nThe night sky fills with fluttering money THE ROPE IS DROPPED -- THREE HUNDRED LITTLE LEAGUERS charge across the infield to the falling money, scooping it up wildly, brawling, shoving, clawing for the cash. \nAs the money flutters down... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DURHAM BASEBALL STADIUM -- SHORT TIME LATER \nCLOSE ON THE ROSIN BAG on the mound. A hand picks it up. \nPuffs of rosin \"smoke\". Nuke is on the mound. \nNUKE NERVOUSLY WALKS AROUND THE MOUND -- Just before the first batter. He picks up the rosin bag. Digs a slot for his lead foot to land. And CRASH APPROACHES, in full gear, mask tipped up on his head. \nCRASH Don't try to strike everybody out. (beat) Strikeouts are boring. They're Fascist. Throw some ground balls, it's more Democratic. \nCRASH TURNS AND HEADS TO THE PLATE and we hear the beginning of Nuke's interior monologue. \nNUKE (V.O.) What's this guy know, eh? If he's so great why's he been in the minors for ten years? And if he's so hot how come Annie wants me instead of him. \nCRASH TURNS AROUND HALF WAY TO THE PLATE and returns to the mound, as if he knows everything Nuke's thinking. \nCRASH And listen, meat. You don't know shit. If you want to get to the Show, you'll listen to me. She only wants you 'cause she can boss you around, got it? (beat, complete tone change) Relax, have a ball out here. This game's fun, okay? Fun, God damn it. (beat) And don't squeeze the ball so tight. It's an egg. Hold it like an egg. \nCRASH SMILES -- And trots back to the plate. \nNUKE'S P.O.V. The first batter steps in. Crash gives the sign for the pitch. \nNUKE Fun? What's he know about fun? (beat) Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat. \nCRASH Shake off the pitch. Throw what you wanta. \nNUKE SHAKES OFF THE PITCH -- Here comes Crash back out to the mound before Nuke's thrown a pitch. \nCRASH Why you shaking me off? \nNUKE I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority. \nCRASH \"To announce your fucking presence with authority\"? This guy's a first ball fastball hitter. He's looking for heat. \nNUKE But he ain't seen my heat -- \nCRASH Awright, meat, give him your heat. \nCRASH RETURNS ONE MORE TIME to behind the plate. \nCRASH CROSSES THE PLATE, past the hitter. He speaks to the opposing leadoff batter. \nCRASH Fastball. \nNUKE Why's he always call me \"Meat\"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche. \nNUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS -- A fastball. \nTHE LEADOFF HITTER TEES OFF on the pitch and sends a line shot over the right field fence. \nCLOSE ON BILLBOARD -- \"Hit Cow, Win Steak\" sign, The home run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump. \nThe COW'S MOUTH OPENS AND MOOS. \nTHE BATTER STANDS AND WATCHES the home run, admiring the shot, enjoying the moment. CRASH GETS IN HIS FACE instantly -- and gets very tough. \nCRASH What're you lookin' at?! You're showing up my pitcher, bush -- get your ass in gear! \nTHE BATTER TAKES OFF ON A HOME RUN TROT -- Slightly scared. \nAND CRASH HEADS TO THE MOUND where Nuke watches the Mooing Cow and the circling batter with dismay. Crash smiles. \nCRASH Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh? \nNUKE Well, I held it like an egg. \nCRASH An' he scrambled the son of a bitch. (beat) Having fun yet? \nNUKE I'm having a blast. (beat) God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball. \nCRASH He did know. \nNUKE How? \nCRASH I told him. \nCRASH SMILES -- Drops the mask, returns behind the plate. \nNUKE SIGHS -- Takes a deep breath. \nNUKE Don't think. Just throw. Don't think. Just throw. \nA couple snickers from the players. Skip whirls. \nSKIP What're you laughing at?! \nSilence. \nThe Durham Bulls sit and stand quietly. \nSKIP You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout. You know what that makes ya (beat) Lollygaggers. What's our record, Larry? \nLARRY We're eight and sixteen. \nSKIP Eight and sixteen?! How'd we ever win eight? (beat) Jose, what's this sign? \nSKIP FLASHES THROUGH A SEQUENCE of signs. Hand to face, hand to belt, hand brushes letters, etc. \nJOSE That's the steal. \nSKIP Wrong. That's the bunt. This is the steal. \nSKIP FLASHES QUICKLY ANOTHER SEQUENCE -- Hand to face, hands to hands. He speaks rapidly -- a private language. \nSKIP Face is \"skin to skin\". Skin starts with \"S\". \"S\" stands for steal if it follows the indicator which is hand to eye 'cause the word \"indicator\" starts with an \"I\" so I figure \"eye\" -- (touches his eye) -- would remind you of \"I\" for indicator to indicate that what follows is the sign. I figure wrong -- You're a buncha lollygaggers. (beat) This is a simple game. (beat) ya throw the ball, ya hit the ball, ya catch the ball. \nCLOSE ON FACES OF THE PLAYERS -- Sitting silently. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE BALLPARK SIMULTANEOUS -- NIGHT \nTHE SIX PLAYERS' WIVES WAIT in a cluster. Three of them have SMALL CHILDREN. The children are crying. \nThe long-suffering women try to calm the kids. \nBOBBY'S WIFE Bobby went hitless again. He's gonna be in a terrible mood... terrible. How'd Mickey do? \nMICKEY'S WIFE He got two hits. \nBOBBY'S WIFE Lucky you. \nCUT TO: \nBACK INSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM -- Skip is winding down. \nSKIP We can't win at home -- how we gonna win on the road? We got a twelve day road trip starting tomorrow. (beat) Bus leaves at six in the morning. \nSKIP HEADS BACK INSIDE his little office with Larry. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- He and Larry open a couple beers. \nTHE DOOR OPENS -- BOBBY ENTERS wearing only a towel. \nBOBBY You wanted to see me? \nSKIP Yeah, Bobby, shut the door. (he does) This is the toughest job a manager has... (beat) But the organization has decided to make a change -- \nBOBBY Skip, I know I'm in a slump but I hit the ball hard tonight, right at 'em. A couple flares drop in, and I'm back in the groove! \nThe nearly naked 25 year old man pleads helplessly -- his career is over. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE STADIUM -- NIGHT \nTHE PLAYERS EXIT -- The Groupies wait in a cluster. The wives wait in another group. Bobby's wife sees Bobby. \nBOBBY'S WIFE (to child) There's Daddy! Wave to Daddy! \n-- P.O.V. BOBBY COMING OUT OF THE CLUBHOUSE -- Another player has his arm around Bobby, consoling him. The wife knows. \nBOBBY'S WIFE Oh God... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN \nTHE DURHAM BULLS TEAM BUS is parked. Luggage is loaded. Sleepy players arriving, escorted by wives and girlfriends. \nANNIE BIDS NUKE GOODBYE -- Off to the side. She pulls something from her handbag and hands it to Nuke. A pair of WOMEN'S RED PANTIES, with lace and frills. \nANNIE I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch. \nNUKE What? \nANNIE They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently -- plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters. \nNUKE Jesus, Annie, I don't know -- \nANNIE You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain. These'll help move things to the right side. \nNUKE Big League pitchers don't use these. \nANNIE They did when they were in the Carolina League. \nNUKE STUFFS THE PANTIES in his pocket, bewildered. A small kiss from Annie, and he hurries to the bus. \nCRASH I was in the Show for 21 days, once. (beat) It was the greatest 21 days of my life. You never touch your luggage in the show -- somebody else handles your bags. It's great. (beat) The ballparks are like cathedrals, the hotels all have room service, the women have long legs and brains -- it's a smorgasbord. \nDEKE The women are hot, eh? \nCRASH Yeah -- and so are the pitchers. They throw ungodly breaking stuff in the Show -- exploding sliders. \nNuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement. \nCRASH You could be one of those guys -- but you don't give a fuck, Meat. \nNUKE God damn it I'm sick of you calling me \"Meat\"! You wanta step outside! \nCRASH HOPS TO HIS FEET as the bus barrels along, grabbing Nuke by the collar. \nCRASH Yeah, let's go. \nNuke quickly has second thoughts -- Crash can be terrifying. \nNUKE No. Wait a minute. Calm down, Crash... \nNuke sits back down. Calms. Reaches for a baseball sitting nearby. He hands the ball to Crash. \nNUKE Teach me how to throw a breaking ball. \nCrash takes the ball gently and speaks softly: \nCRASH As I was saying ya hold it like an egg. \nAs the bus rolls through the country: \nA LATE 60'S OLDS CONVERTIBLE ROARS PAST -- Max Patkin at the wheel. He waves at the team bus and honks. \nThe opening bars on the National Anthem -- \"Oh Say Can You See\" \nAnd Max roars off through the rolling green-landscape... \nHit Hank Williams music to play over: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WINSTON-SALEM BASEBALL STADIUM -- DAY \nMAX PATKIN COACHES THIRD in his comic routine, now, for the Winston-Salem team, as Durham is in the field. \nA WINSTON-SALEM BATTER lines a double off the wall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DURHAM RADIO STATION -- DAY \nTEDDY THE ANNOUNCER re-creates the game for broadcast with a several second delay. \nHIS ASSISTANT (P.A. ANNOUNCER FROM THE BALLPARK) has a phone to her ear, and writes down each play on a piece of paper, holding it up for Teddy who enhances shamelessly in his ON THE AIR \"play by play\". \nCLOSE ON PAPER -- His assistant writes \"DOUBLE TO LEFT\". \nTEDDY HITS A TINY MALLET against a jar. Thunk. The sound of ball hitting bat. He punches one of several tape cassettes cued up. A crowd roars. An array of special effects is at his fingertips. \nTEDDY (on the air) ...double off the wall by Higgins, and once again the Durham pitchers are unable to get the first out of the inning... \nHIS ASSISTANT WRITES ANOTHER NOTE -- \"ERROR MCFEE\" \nThunk -- The mallet again. \nTEDDY (on the air) Line drive to center -- a diving stab by McFee -- ohhhh!  Ball gets by his glove, another run in and the crowd loves it -- \nPUNCHES A CASSETTE -- A crowd roars. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

GREENSBORO BALLPARK LOCKER ROOM -- DAY \nNUKE DRESSES FOR THE GAME -- He pulls the RED PANTIES out of his bag. Looks around the clubhouse. Nobody sees them. He's embarrassed anyway -- and stuffs them back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GREENSBORO BALLPARK DAY \nNUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- The batter swings, and: \nCUT TO: \nINT. RADIO STATION -- DAY \nThe General Manager studies the field. Hopeless. \nHe looks up at the sky. Cloudless, sunny. \nKINGSTON G.M. (to his assistant) Call the radio and the paper.

The beautiful, leggy women skating to the \"Blue Danube Waltz\". \nTEN OF THE DURHAM BULLS sit in the front row. Nuke, Deke, Tommy, others, but not Crash. Tony waves to a skater. \nTHE SKATER WAVES BACK as she swirls past the Bulls. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE KINGSTON HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT \nDEKE ICES THE CHAMPAGNE -- In the b.g. Tommy is blow drying his hair. Mickey puts the finishing touches on his outfit. Several other players get ready to party. \nDEKE Par--ty! I blew a whole day's meal money for this champagne seven dollars, man, it better be good. \nMICKEY For seven bucks it better be some serious shit. \nTOMMY What time is it, eh? When are they coming? \nThe guys lounge around nervously, trying to be casual. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KINGSTON HOTEL COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT \nCLOSE ON A STEAK DINNER set down in front of Crash. \nNuke hands Crash a hundred dollar bill. \nNUKE This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party. \nCRASH Naw... \nNUKE \"Naw\"? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater? \nCRASH By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies -- (beat) I'm through with one night stands. \nNUKE You're through with one night stands?! What do you want? \nCRASH I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries -- and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am. \nNuke just stares at him. \nNUKE You're weird, man -- I want a ice skater real bad. \nCRASH Go for it. \nNUKE If I get laid, you won't tell Annie? \nCRASH I won't have to. \nNUKE LOOKS AT HIM STRANGELY -- And hurries to the party. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE PARTY ROOM -- NIGHT \nTHE GUYS ARE GROOMING TO EXCESS -- Still blow drying and preening for each other. \nA knock at the door. \nTHEY QUICKLY GET \"CASUAL\" and lounge seductively. \nDEKE It's them, it's them! Be casual. (calling out) Come in! \nTHE DOOR OPENS -- It's Nuke. \nNUKE Hey, guys, pa--rty! \nTOMMY Shut up and be cool, man. Like Mickey there... \nMICKEY \"LOUNGES\" WITH A DRINK and a cigaret. \nMICKEY You wanta make it to the Show, Rock, you gotta learn how to \"lounge\". \nNUKE LEANS ON THE BAR with an elbow, striking his version of a \"lounging\" pose. \nNUKE How's this? \nMICKEY You got it. \nA knock at the door. \nTOMMY Entre. \nEIGHT ICE SKATERS STAND IN THE DOORWAY -- Ready to... \nSKIP Eight and twenty-four! How'd we ever win 8 games? \nLARRY It's a miracle. \nSKIP Look, guys -- I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party -- but... (beat) sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know. (beat) There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere. (looking around) Where's Crash? \nNUKE STEPS FORWARD -- Hands Skip the hundred dollar bill.. \nNUKE He can't make it. Here's his fine. \nSKIP Aw Christ, he don't have to come. He's hitting .350. \nTOMMY Don't you think that's a double standard -- we're here and he ain't? \nSKIP I believe in a double standard for guys hitting .350. (beat) Look, men -- you got a choice. You wanta be roasting your nuts off for Midas Muffler welding exhaust pipes up the assholes of Cadillacs... or -- (beat) You wanta be sitting in the Caddy while some other guy's crawling around in a monkey suit with a blow torch? (beat) There's only two places you can be in life -- in the Caddy or under it. (nearly pleading) These are the best years of your lives. These are the glamor days. (beat) It don't got any better than this. (threatening, tough) But... if this club don't start winning soon, there's gonna be changes made! \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANNIE'S HOUSE SIMULTANEOUS -- NIGHT \nCLOSE ON TELEVISION -- \"DYNASTY\" drones on. \nDEKE'S WIFE (wistfully) Deke was a great player in high school. I thought held go right to the Major Leagues -- I was gonna be a Big League wife. (beat) Pass the Pampers, please. \nCRASH Helluva guy -- \nSilence. \nCrash flips off the T.V. with the remote. \nNUKE Can I ask you something? \nCRASH What? \nNUKE What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties? \nCRASH If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him. \nCrash turns off the light. \nCLOSE ON NUKE -- A bit of light spill on his face. Eyes open. A long ways from sleep. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A CAROLINA LEAGUE BALLPARK -- NIGHT \nCLOSE ON NUKE'S FACE -- He takes his cap off, wipes his brow. \nHe's pitching. Everything in SLO-MO. \nFANS IN THE BALLPARK LAUGH at Nuke, mocking his. \nEXTREME CLOSE UP ON NUKE'S EYES -- Frightened. \nSLOW FULLBACK ON NUKE -- HE'S STARK NAKED save for his cap and glove. Everyone else is clothed. \nNUKE WINDS AND PITCHES in the nude. SLO-MO... and as the batter cranks up to take a vicious swing -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. TEAM BUS -- DAWN \nCLOSE ON NUKE'S FACE -- He awakes with a start. \nNUKE No! \nCRASH LEANS OVER and shakes him. \nCRASH Wake up, it's okay... you're dreaming... \nCRASH HELPS NUKE back to consciousness. Nuke shakes his head, trying to wake up. Crash is almost tender. \nNUKE I was playing naked. \nCRASH I know, I know -- I have that dream all the time. We're almost home. \nThe Bus continues across the Carolina landscape. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN \nThe team bus pulls into a deserted parking lot. A few of the players' cars are parked. Some of the wives and girlfriends. And Annie. \nTHE PLAYERS SHUFFLE OFF the bus. Tired and beat. \nCLOSE ON NUKE -- He looks worse than the rest. He sees Annie and waves. She's waiting next to her old Volvo. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREETS OF DURHAM MOMENTS LATER \nANNIE'S VOLVO PULLS OUT -- She drives. \nINT. THE VOLVO -- DAY \nAnnie is up -- Nuke is down. \nNuke stares, unsettled. \nNUKE God... I think I'm gonna be sick -- \nANNIE Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing to be scared of. It's just another way of living. It's just a fresh start -- kinda like spring training. \nNuke thinks about this carefully. Looks at the ashes, at Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head. \nNUKE Death is like spring training? \nANNIE Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in the eyes, Nuke -- (sweetly accusing him) You haven't been wearing my panties, have you? \nCLOSE ON NUKE -- Utterly bewildered. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT \nNUKE PULLS HIS JOCKSTRAP ON over the red panties. \nCrash notices the panties, and snaps the waistband. \nCRASH Hot. Very hot... \nNuke looks around nervously, continues dressing quickly. \nNUKE Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers. She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for. \nCRASH Annie's a smart lady. \nSuddenly Deke spots Nuke's panties. \nDEKE Hey, fruit alert! Check out the Rook. \nSEVERAL PLAYERS GATHER AROUND -- Wolf whistles aimed at Nuke as the players are dressing into their uniforms. \nNUKE Annie says there's no such thing as straight and gay. We're all sexual creatures to start with, and we get formed into certain roles. \nTOMMY You believe that? \nNUKE When I'm one and six I'll believe anything. (as they dress) Annie also says that God is a woman. You believe that, Crash, you think God's a lady? \nCRASH God's definitely a woman -- but she's no lady. \nTOMMY This is all Commie bullshit. (beat) God has a dick, man. \nTONY God damn it, Jimmy, you're an expert -- does God have a dick or a pussy? \nJIMMY TURNS FROM HIS CUBICLE to answer the theological question.  Ll heads wait for the answer. \nJIMMY The Lord God is tri-une -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. \nTOMMY Father and Son. Awright! \nThe guys slap fives, convinced God is a man. \nMICKEY (baiting them) Yeah, but He is a brother. \nTOMMY Bullshit! God ain't no brother! \nDeke turns to Crash, full of despair. \nDEKE If there is a God, why am I hitting \nSUDDENLY SKIP AND LARRY APPEAR to restore order. \nSKIP Shut up! This is a damn noisy clubhouse for a team that's lost 15 straight. \nSilence. \nSkip takes off his cap -- instantly sincere. \nSKIP Patkin was a tribute to baseball... \nLARRY ...and one helluva guy. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DURHAM BALLPARK -- DUSK \nA BLACK GOSPEL GROUP at a mike at home plate, singing: \nGOSPEL SINGER (singing) I come to the garden alone, When the dew is still on the roses, And the voice I hear, whispering in my ear,. The Son of God discloses -- \nANNIE SPRINKLES MAX'S ASHES on the pitcher's mound, as: \nJACKSON SITS IN THE DUGOUT FILLING ROSIN BAGS with the extra ashes from a box. \nEXTREME CLOSE UP -- A ROSIN BAG MARKED \"MAX\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXTREME CLOSE UP -- \"MAX\" ROSIN BAG on the mound. \nEXT. DURHAM BALLPARK -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- NIGHT \nNUKE ON THE MOUND -- PICKS UP the rosin bag, and paces. A small crowd. A batter steps in to hit. Nuke looks in for the sign. \nSKIP AND LARRY IN THE DUGOUT -- Skip looks at Larry as if to say \"What's happening?\" Larry just shrugs. \nCUT TO: \nBACK TO THE FIELD -- Nuke's next pitch. \nTHE NEXT BATTER POPS UP -- Crash circles into foul ground to make the catch, whipping the ball around the infield. \nAND CRASH GOES TO THE MOUND for a visit. \nNUKE Hey, I'm cruisin', man -- what're you doing out here?! \nCRASH I want you to throw this one at the bat rack. \nNUKE Why?! I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to. \nCRASH It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters. Trust me. \nNUKE You're the boss. \nCRASH RETURNS TO THE PLATE -- Flashes a sign. \nCUT TO: \nTHE PRESS BOX Teddy's getting worked up. \nTEDDY THE RADIO MAN -- a staggering start by LaLoosh -- he's thrown 5 cuts on 9 pitches, all of them strikes -- he's got pin point control here tonight, Bull fans... here's the pitch -- \nCUT TO: \nNUKE'S NEXT DELIVERY -- A wild ass rocket thirty feet off line. The BULL MASCOT DIVES for cover. \nTHE BATTER STEPS OUT OF THE BOX nervously, muttering. \nBATTER This guy's crazy. \nCRASH Yep. Next one might be at your head. Hell if I know where the damn thing's going... \nCLOSE ON NUKE -- Smiles. Winds. Delivers. A change up. \nTHE BATTER SWINGS TERRIBLY OFF STRIDE -- Strike three. Crash whips the ball around the infield. \nCUT TO: \nSCOREBOARD: DURHAM 11, KINGSTON 0 -- TOP OF THE NINTH \nTEDDY THE RADIO MAN -- top of the ninth, two outs, one out away from a stunning two hit shutout for LaLoosh... \nCUT TO: \nNUKE ON THE MOUND -- Bearing down. \nNUKE Bear down, Meat, don't let up. You own these guys. Dad'll love a shutout... \nP.O.V. CRASH FLASHES THE SIGN -- Nuke doesn't like it. \nNUKE No, no -- this guy's looking for heat -- lemme give him the deuce -- \nNUKE SHAKES OFF THE SIGN Cocky, full of himself. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE AND JACKSON in her box seat. \nANNIE Oh no -- he's shaking off the sign, Jackson. Big mistake... \nJACKSON He'll learn. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON CRASH BEHIND THE PLATE \nCRASH This son of a bitch is throwing a two hit shutout and he's shaking me off?! (to batter and umpire) Hey Charlie, here comes the deuce. \nNUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- A hanging curveball. The batter takes an ungodly cut, and BLASTS a long home. \nTHE BATTER STANDS AT THE PLATE watching the blast... until CRASH SHOVES HIM toward first with a sneer. For a moment it looks like there'll be a fight -- but the hitter backs off and takes the home run trot as: \nNUKE STARES AT THE OUTFIELD WALL as the batter circles the bases. Crash walks to the mound. \nNUKE You told him I was throwing a deuce, right? \nCRASH Yep. He really crushed that dinger, didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet... damn... \nNUKE HOLDS OUT HIS GLOVE -- Says nothing. Crash puts a new ball in the glove. Returns to the plate. \nNUKE GETS THE SIGN -- Winds. Delivers. Batter hits a weak one hopper back to the mound. Game's over. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- LATER -- NIGHT \nA raucous celebration of the victory. Booze flows. \nAnd we begin hearing the familiar sounds of Piaf... \nCUT TO: \nCRASH I think of you and the \"boy\" all the time. \nANNIE He won't make love to me anymore. \nCRASH And he's right! A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often. (beat) You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties -- then you are! (beat) And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit. \nANNIE I want you desperately! \nCrash can hardly keep up. So he slows her down -- \nCRASH Who are you? Do you have a job? \nANNIE I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me. \nCRASH And now you wanta teach me? \nANNIE I don't imagine there's much I could teach you. \nCRASH I doubt that. \nANNIE Crash, I get wet just thinking about you. \nCRASH I thought you wanted an \"uncomplicated\" boy? \nANNIE I'm ready for a complicated man. \nCRASH -- and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms. \nANNIE I said when I think about you, I get wet. \nCRASH Annie, I think you should leave. \nAnnie launches into a tirade without orchestration or self- awareness. She's frustrated, confused, angry and... \nANNIE God damn you -- what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me? (beat) This is the weirdest season I ever saw -- the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid! \nCRASH (softly) You okay? \nAnnie slides against the wall down to the floor. Tears flow. Her makeup runs. Her eyes are red. \nANNIE (shakily) I need a drink. \nCrash gingerly helps her to her feet. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- DAY \nANNIE AND CRASH SIT IN THE CORNER of the empty bar. \nCRASH Why baseball? \nANNIE (sighs) I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5 -- born again before kindergarten... by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home... \nSHE SMILES at the most painful memories. \nANNIE pregnant, had an abortion, got pregnant again, had an abortion again... gave up men. Tried women. Missed men. My mother died. (beat) I bought a car for $200 and drove to Ft. Lauderdale to bury her. (beat) And after we'd sung some hymns in some wretched Florida funeral home, I went outside and something happened -- \nHer tone becomes wistful, nostalgic. \nANNIE The smell of cut grass in the warm March air overwhelmed me and I heard a noise -- (makes the sound)) -- tok, tok, tok -- and some men shouting... then tok, tok, tok. \nCrash smiles slightly. He knows. \nANNIE I crossed the street -- it was the New York Yankees spring training field -- tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat -- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother... (beat) And I saw him. \nCRASH Who? \nANNIE Thurman Munson. (beat) He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody -- it was beautiful... (beat) And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition! (beat) So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball. \nCRASH What's so great about baseball? \nANNIE If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else -- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home. (beat) Don't you see? If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is! \nSilence. \nCRASH I don't know if I'd go that far. \nANNIE It's true, It's true! (beat, down) Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash? \nCRASH It's possible. \nANNIE No. \nCRASH Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're \nANNIE Well... I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I'm not so sure. \nCRASH Why not? \nANNIE (angrily) Whatta you mean \"why not\"? Are you gonna play forever?! \nBefore Crash can answer -- \nSUDDENLY A VOICE interrupts. They both turn to see: \nMILLIE EXCITEDLY DRAGGING JIMMY into the nearly empty bar. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MOUND -- Larry joins the convention. \nLARRY What the hell's going on out here? \nCRASH Nuke's scared cause his nostrils are jammed and his old man's here, we need a live rooster to take the curse off Jose's glove, and nobody knows what to get Jimmy and Millie for their wedding present -- there's a whole lotta shit we're trying to deal with -- \nLARRY Oh. I thought there was a problem. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANNIE'S HOUSE NIGHT \nANNIE IS HELPING MILLIE make her WEDDING DRESS. \nThe game can be heard on the radio in the b.g. \nMILLIE You should be at the game. \nANNIE No, no -- I'm fine. Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed? \nAnnie holds the dress up to Millie. \nMILLIE Five hours. We both just know. (studying the dress) Do you think I deserve to wear white? \nANNIE We all deserve to wear white. \nBOTH WOMEN TURN THEIR HEADS to the radio to listen. \nTEDDY THE RADIO MAN ...line drive up the alley's gonna score at least two, here comes the relay -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DURHAM BALLPARK THE GAME NIGHT \nCRASH FLIPS HIS MASK -- A runner rounds third heading for home. Here comes the throw, on a line. It hits once on the infield grass, takes a long hop -- \nAS THE RUNNER BARRELS TOWARD THE PLATE -- Crash takes the throw. \nTHE RUNNER SLIDES -- Crash blocks the plate. A cloud of dust. A close play. \nTHE UMPIRE SIGNALS \"SAFE\" -- And Crash flips out. In a second he is nose to nose with the UMPIRE. \nCRASH I got him on the knee! \nUMPIRE You missed him! \nCRASH God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate. \nTHEIR FACES ARE INCHES APART -- Screaming face to face. \nUMPIRE Don't bump me. \nCRASH It was a cocksucking call! \nUMPIRE Did you call me a cocksucker? \nCRASH No! I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that! \nUMPIRE You missed the tag! \nCRASH You spit on me! \nUMPIRE I didn't spit on you! \nCRASH You're in the wrong business, Jack -- you're Sears-Roebuck material! \nUMPIRE You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?

And hurt. His stoicism is professional. \nSKIP The organization wants to make a change... now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher... \nLARRY Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg... probably a bust. \nSKIP I put in a word for you with the organization -- told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...

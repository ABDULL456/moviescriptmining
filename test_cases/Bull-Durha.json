Clothes scattered across the floor, overturned lamps, the bed lies at a cockeyed angle. Annie and Crash lie face down -- asleep, utterly spent. \nCRASH WAKES UP SLOWLY -- Reaches up and pulls his underwear off of a lampshade, pulls them on, and gets slowly out of bed. He staggers across the bedroom floor, stumbling a bit, into: \nTHE LIVING ROOM -- He stumbles across the trashed room. Record album covers, more liquor bottles, pillows, cushions, pictures hanging crookedly on the wall. \nCRASH TAKES THE SKIPPING RECORD off the player and breathes a sigh of relief.

The only real cleaning I did was on the kitchen floor 'cause who likes to walk on spilt cereal? \nSHE FINDS A BIT OF A JOINT on the floor as she's cleaning. She picks it up, sits on the floor under the table, and lights the tiny joint. \nANNIE (V.O.) The funny thing is, I stopped worrying about Nuke. Somehow I knew nothing would stop him.

It rained and rained and I thought of driving down to Asheville to see Crash but then I thought \"No, what you pursue, eludes you\". I had to trust Quantum Physics and the Church of Baseball.

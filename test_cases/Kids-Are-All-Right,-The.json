{"train": "JULES Laser, no phone calls at the table. \nLASER (into phone) Lemme hit you back. \nLaser hangs up.   Nic re-enters with a large glass of red. NIC (sitting down) Who was that? LASER Nobody.    Clay. \nJules and Nic share a look. Jules starts making maternal windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on Laser's arm. JULES Can I ask you something? What do you get from your relationship with Clay? LASER What do you mean, \"get\"? \nLaser looks down at Jules' thumb on his arm. JULES Do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow? LASER Mom, you're windshield wiping me. \nNIC Hey, did you start on those thank- you notes for your birthday gifts? \nJONI Not yet.   But I will... \nNIC I just think it's easier to knock them out when it's fresh. JONI Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight. \nNIC Great...I mean, you don't want to have to start with an apology. You know? Then it's embarrassing. JULES Okay, honey. She got it. Let it go. NIC Okay, I'll let it go... (then) I mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank-you notes, they'd just send out good vibes. \nNic takes another swig of vino and smiles at Joni through increasingly plum-stained teeth. NIC (CONT'D) I can't believe my baby's 18. \nJULES I know... \nNIC (devolving into baby talk) Big girl. You're a big girl... JONI Mom... \nJoni mimes wiping her teeth.   Embarrassed, Nic starts licking at her stained teeth. \nINT. JONI'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT As Joni cranks out thank-you notes, Laser enters. \nJONI What? Laser looks nervous. \nLASER Have you thought any more about, you know, making that call...? JONI Yeah.   I don't want to. \nLASER Okay...I was just wondering if you changed your mind. \nJONI I haven't. \nHe starts to leave, but her answer bugs him.    He turns back. LASER How can you not even be curious? \nJONI Sorry, Laser. I just don't want to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I don't want to deal with that right now. (co-dependent leak) And also, that could really hurt moms' feelings... \nLASER God, why do you worry about them so much? They don't even have to know about it! \nJONI Look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay? LASER I never ask you for anything. \nLaser walks out of the room.   Joni feels horrible. \nINT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT \nNic and Jules lay in bed watching TV, unwinding from the day. NIC I just don't understand why you bought the truck now. \nJULES Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in. \nNIC Jesus Christ! Nic flops back, traumatized. \nNIC (CONT'D) The whole neighborhood heard that! JULES No, they didn't. \nNIC Well, that was a vibe kill. \nJules looks defeated. \nINT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nJoni turns back to the file on the desk. She flips though some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4 YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox looking straight into a camera with a big, open grin. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nEXT. FARM - DAY \nWe see that boy, 35 years later, carrying a box of tomatoes and putting them in the back of a truck. This is PAUL, Joni and Laser's biological father. \nINT. PAUL'S RESTAURANT - \"WYSIWYG\"    - DAY Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches TANYA, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess. PAUL How you doing, foxy? \nTANYA Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe. \nPAUL Oh, sorry... TANYA No, I like it. It's earthy. \nPAUL What can I say. I've just been out there, you know...hoe-ing. (looking at the seating chart) How's it looking tonight? They stand close to each other, peering at the chart. \nTANYA Gonna be tight. PAUL Really... \nPaul's cell rings. He gives Tanya a hand squeeze and heads for the kitchen, answering. PAUL (CONT'D) Hello. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Hi, is this Paul Hatfield? \nPAUL It is.   Who's this? \nWOMAN'S VOICE My name is Wendy Minter. I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank. PAUL Okay.   What can I do for you? \nWENDY I just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between 1991 and 1993. At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale. \nPAUL Yeah...I did a little bit of that back then... \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for the dinner rush. He looks around for a quiet spot. \nWENDY As you know the Cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent. \nA cook, MARGO, approaches Paul to speak with him.   Paul nods: \"Can't talk.\" Hands her the box of tomatoes. \nPAUL Uh-huh. Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy. \nINT. PANTRY - SAME Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner. \nWENDY (O.S.) Well we've been contacted by a young woman conceived using your semen, and she's asked if you'd be open to having contact with her. \nJONI Yeah. Well, technically my half- brother. Each of my moms had a kid, you know, with your sperm... PAUL No.   I didn't know. \nJONI Oh. PAUL Both of them? \nJONI Yeah. \nPAUL Like in two? JONI Uh huh.   Like in gay. \nPAUL Good deal.     I love lesbians. Paul cringes at his lameness.     Joni doesn't know what to say. \nOMITTED. \nEXT. \"WYSIWYG\", PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY \nJoni and Laser get out of the car and head to the restaurant to meet Paul. They're both clearly nervous. \nJONI I just don't want you to have big expectations. \nLASER Will you quit saying that?    I don't have any expectations. JONI Okay. I'm just saying he might be weird. I mean, he donated sperm... LASER Well if he hadn't done it, you wouldn't be here. So respect, yo! \nINT. \"WYSIWYG\" - DAY Paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance.   He nervously checks the door as customers enter. \nMINUTES LATER- Joni and Laser enter the restaurant.   They look nervous too. \nANGLE ON PAUL \nHe studies them for a beat, sees them looking around. Figures they must be \"his kids.\" They look in his direction, spot him. He raises his hand, stands. They walk over. \nThe moment is rife.    Paul holds out his hand to Joni. PAUL Joni.    Hey. Nice to meet you. \nJONI Nice to meet you too. Paul holds out a hand to Laser. \nPAUL And Laser, right? LASER Right. \nPAUL Very cool name. \nLASER Thanks. \nPAUL Thanks for making the trek all the way over here. No one knows what comes next. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Cool, I got a table set up for us out here... \nPaul turns and leads them out to the outdoor dining area. \nEXT. OUTDOOR DINING AREA - MINUTES LATER \nThey all sit eating.    Paul can't help but study their faces. PAUL Listen, feel free and ask me anything you want, okay? (off their stares) Or we can just hang out. That's fine too. Whatever you guys want. \nLASER/JONI Okay. Paul presses on, trying to break the ice. \nPAUL Anything you want to ask me, Laser? LASER I...uh...I didn't really have any specific questions... PAUL (helping him out) That's fine. I'd love to know about you guys. What about you, Joni? What are you up to? JONI Uh, well, I just graduated high school. I'm starting college in the fall. PAUL Oh yeah?     Congratulations. \nJONI Yeah...totally...thank you. \nNow Paul and Laser share a somewhat awkward man-hug. \nPAUL Really nice to meet you, Laser. \nLASER Yeah. \nJoni gives a quick wave to Paul. She turns to go and Laser follows. Paul watches them walk away. He looks stirred up by the meeting. \nINT. JONI'S CAR - DAY \nJoni and Laser head back home. \nJONI I just never pictured him that way. I just...I don't know...He was so cool and interesting. I can't believe that was him...He was so nice, you know?... LASER I guess... \nJONI You guess? \nLASER Yeah... JONI God, Laser! You're the one that wanted to meet him so bad! \nLASER I know. \nJONI Well what did you think of him? LASER I don't know. He seemed kind of into himself. \nOMITTED \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nNic and Jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch watching cable. They see Laser on his way out of the house. \nJULES Hey bug, come here. We're watching \"Locked Up Abroad: Uganda.\" LASER I saw it.    It was gnarly. NIC Where are you going? \nLASER Clay's. \nJules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look. \nNIC Don't be back late, okay? \nLASER I know. JULES Can I have a hug before you go? \nLASER Mom... JULES Just a quick one.   Please! \nLASER Hug her.    That's what she's there for. \nLaser leaves.   Nic hits mute on the TV, looks at Jules. NIC Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already. \nJULES What?    \"Are you and Clay fucking?\" \nNIC \"Exploring\" is the word I'd use... \nJULES And what if he is \"exploring?\" This is the age for that. Why should we care? \nCLAY (CONT'D) Whoa! \nClay turns on the dildo.      It starts to gyrate. \nCLAY (CONT'D) Yo, it's alive! \nLASER Dude, put it back!! Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer.    Then he grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around. \nCLAY Dude, we're watching this. \nINT. LASER'S ROOM - DAY \nLaser and Clay sit on the bed.     They look at each other. Then Laser hits play. \nON SCREEN \nWe see a COP giving a young MAN a BLOW-JOB. Laser and Clay sit motionless, shocked, disgusted, riveted. \nCLAY Think the whole thing's like this? \nLASER Want me to fast-forward? \nClay doesn't answer.    They just keep watching. \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nEXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY Jules pulls her truck into the driveway, almost running over Laser's bike. \nINT. LASER'S ROOM - DAY \nLaser and Clay are still watching the porn...as Jules walks in the room. JULES Laser, you left your bike out... \nLaser reflexively grabs for the remote. As he fumbles for it, Jules sees what they're watching. She looks mortified. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING \nWe enter a family conference already in progress. Nic and Jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their 15-year-old son found their porn. \nNIC Laser, your mom and I accept you and love you unconditionally? You know that, right? \nLASER Yeah. \nNIC And you know you can be open with us about anything. \nLASER Yeah, I know. \nJules steels herself for a frank discussion. \nJULES Laser, is there anything you want to talk about? LASER Like what? NIC Anything.     Anything on your mind. \nNIC But why didn't you tell us? \nJONI Because we knew you'd be upset. \nNIC WE'RE NOT UPSET!! \nJules calms her riled-up partner. JULES Honey... (to Joni; expressing her upset more calmly) We just wish you'd have included us in your thinking. But what's done is done. You met him, and now you guys can move on-- \nJONI (sheepish) Actually... (beat) I want to see him again. JULES                             LASER You do?!                         You do?! \nJONI (CONT'D) (to Laser) Yeah. I was gonna tell you. \nNIC Whoa! Whoa! No. No way. (regaining dominance) Nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him! \nJoni looks at Laser.   They knew this would happen. \nINT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT \nNic and Jules do a post-mortem as they floss. \nNIC Yeah, I get it. He's their biological father and all that crap but it still feels really shitty. Like we're not enough or something, you know? \nJULES Of course I know. I don't want to time-share our kids with someone. Especially when it's Joni's last summer home. No way. \nWhen Jules leaves the room Nic pulls a clump of long, wet red hair out of the sink. NIC Jesus, Jules! The plumber was just here! \nNic throws the clump of hair in the trash. \nINT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nNIC (getting tactical) Look, we need to be smart about this. If we act like grubby bitches, we're just gonna make it worse. JULES I know... \nNIC Let's just kill him with kindness and put it to bed. \nJULES I'm with you, honey. (then) We're gonna get through this, okay? \nNic smiles.   She loves when Jules shows confidence. NIC I love you, chicken. \nThe women bump fists.   They have a plan. JULES I love you too, pony. \nEXT. STREET - AFTERNOON \nPaul rides slowly down the street, checking addresses. He pulls over and cuts his engine in front of the Allgood house. \nOMITTED \nINT/EXT. ALLGOOD FRONT DOOR - AFTERNOON \nPaul rings the bell. Waits. The door opens and Nic and Jules are there smiling with \"kill him with kindness\" faces. \nNIC Paul! It is so great to meet you. I'm Nic. This is Jules. \nLASER See what he did there, mom? You said \"food-services industry,\" then he said \"food-services industry...\" NIC Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks. (apropos of nothing) So, Paul, what about your social life? \nPAUL My social life? NIC You know, are you married, divorced, seeing anyone? \nJONI Mom! \nNIC What?   We're getting to know Paul. PAUL No, never been married or divorced. I date a little, but I'm just kind of focused on my work right now. NIC Oh. \nPaul wants a break from the heat. PAUL So, how'd you guys meet? \nJules smiles, embarrassed.   Nic jumps in. NIC We met at UCLA. I was a resident in the ER and Jules had an emergency. JULES My tongue went numb. \nPAUL Really? \nTHUD!   We turn to see Laser, pounding his head on the table. \nJULES Laser, that's not nice. \nLASER What's not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story 1000 times! PAUL (ignoring Laser) What happened to your tongue? JULES I don't know. I just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and I thought I might gag and then, you know... PAUL Choke?    Die?... \nJULES Yeah...exactly... \nNIC Well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and she'd be fine. \nPAUL So what'd you do for her? NIC Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get her to relax, talk, move her tongue around. LASER Mom, that's gross! \nJULES (ignoring Laser, to Nic) Actually, she started teasing me and that really helped. \nNIC I was trying to distract you. \nJULES I know. And it worked. You were really funny. NIC You were really pretty. \nNic reaches over and caresses Jules' hand.   Joni rolls her eyes, embarrassed. \nJULES So that's it. My tongue started working again. \nNIC And we've been glued at the hip ever since. \nPAUL That's a great story. JULES (beaming) We like it. \nLaser and Joni share a look. PAUL So Nic, I know you're a doctor. How `bout you, Jules? What do you do? Jules never likes this question. \nJULES Well, I, you know, I studied architecture in college... \nPAUL Right... JULES But I'm not an architect. I mean I was on my way to becoming one. But I quit before the kids were born. PAUL Well, that happens... \nJULES When they got a little older, I started a Balinese furniture import business... \nPAUL Right on. \nJULES Yeah.   But that didn't work out. \nLaser doesn't quite buy Paul's altruism.    He looks over at him, then away. \nINT. JONI'S ROOM - DAY \nJai and Joni and Sasha play Scrabble.    Sasha checks out the photos of Paul on Joni's phone. \nSASHA Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox. JAI Must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty? \nSASHA I'm just saying. Spermster's a hottie. Is he single? \nJONI Okay, first of all, ewww. Second, he's a really good person and I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him with your whore juice. \nSasha hops up, energized by the banter. \nSASHA Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta here. You love birds can split my letters... \nSasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous tension. \nJONI You want to keep playing? \nJAI Sure. \nAs Jai incorporates Sasha's tiles into his own, we see Joni gathering her nerve to make a move. Jai probably feels it but in his nervousness he can't look at Joni. \nJAI (CONT'D) Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha, you know... JONI Yeah... \nJoni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch by inch. \nSomehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same time. To the point where he lets slip... JAI It's like she has to sexualize every experience, you know? It's just sad... That stops Joni in her tracks. \nJONI Yeah, it is. It's really sad. Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it. \nINT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-PJ's, sitting at the rim of a RUNNING BATH. There are candles burning. \nJULES Wow.    What's this? \nNIC Come here.     Sit down. \nJules takes a seat beside her.       Nic holds her hand. \nNIC (CONT'D) I'm sorry I've been such a bitch lately. I know I'm not being my highest self. \nJULES Yeah, well... \nNIC You've been really patient with me. I just want you to know that hasn't gone unrecognized. \nNic gives her a long, sweet kiss.      Jules is warming up. \nNIC (CONT'D) Get in. \nCUT TO - JULES \nJULES No, please, just take it away... PAUL You had one bite. \nJULES I have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that's where it'll end up. \nPAUL Hey now, don't go negative on your ass. \nJules blushes at all this talk of her ass. JULES So...you're good with the plants? (off his silence) Look, we don't have to do that. We could do go in a totally different direction if you-- \nPAUL No, I'm just thinking. Hang on. (covers his eyes) Yeah, I'm good with the plants. \nJULES Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence for criticism. \nPAUL I wasn't criticizing you. \nJULES No, I know...I just... (beat) Sometimes Nic can be a little critical, you know. She's a perfectionist. \nPAUL That doesn't mean you have to be negative. \nJules looks away.    We HEAR a knock from the back. LUIS (O.S.) Excuse me, Senora? Hello? \nJules turns, sees Luis standing at the glass door. JULES What's up? \nLUIS 5 o'clock. JULES Yeah.     Okay. \nJules wants Luis to leave her alone.    But he's not going. LUIS Same time tomorrow? \nJULES Yes!    Same time! \nLuis leaves.   Jules turns back to Paul, laughs nervously. \nJULES (CONT'D) Okay.     I'm gonna take off too... \nPAUL (in Luis's accent) Same time tomorrow? Jules pushes Paul, laughing. \nJULES That's mean. \nPaul hands her a Tupperware with some of the pie in it. \nPAUL Here, take this... \nJULES No! \nPAUL Just give it to the kids. JULES Okay!   God, you're such a pusher! Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out. \nJules snaps back, freaked. JULES (CONT'D) Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I don't know where that came from... PAUL (freaked himself) It's okay... \nJULES Okay.   I'm gonna go now... \nJules starts backing away, acting as if nothing happened. \nPAUL Jules...? \nLASER Hey buddy.     Good boy. \nLaser sees the dog has no tags. He looks around for an owner. The dog nuzzles Laser for affection. \nLASER (CONT'D) I've seen this dog around.        I wonder if he's lost. \nCLAY Let's pee on his head. \nLASER What? Clay unzips his fly.     It's difficult with the plaster cast. \nLASER (CONT'D) Dude, don't do that. CLAY Come on.     Hold him... \nClay yanks the dog by his scruff. LASER Dude, Quit it! \nCLAY (mocking) Duuude, quit it! \nSuddenly, Laser gets it. His friend is the tool.     He grabs the dog and smacks him to get him to run away. LASER Go!   Run!    Get out of here! \nThe dog TAKES OFF.     Clay shoves Laser. CLAY Why are you such a fag?! \nLaser shoves Clay back hard. LASER Why are you such a dick?! \nClay HITS Laser in the mouth. Laser touches his lip.     Sees blood, and walks away. Friendship over. \nEXT. URBAN FARM PARKING LOT - ECHO PARK - MAGIC HOUR \nPaul and Joni walk to his motorcycle parked in the dirt lot behind them. Paul grabs his helmet off the bike, hands it to Joni. \nPAUL Here, put this on. Joni takes the helmet and puts it on. Paul fastens the buckle for her. They get on the bike and take off down the hill. \nEXT. ECHO PARK TO THE WEST SIDE - MAGIC HOUR Paul takes Joni home on his motorcycle via Sunset Boulevard. She holds Paul tightly. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING The ladies sit in the living room watching TV. \nJULES Relax. She'll get home when she gets home. \nNIC Quit telling me to relax! They go back to watching TV.   After a beat, we HEAR a motorcycle pull up. \nNIC (CONT'D) What the fuck...! \nEXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nPaul and Joni climb off the bike. Nic storms out of the house to intercept them by the sidewalk. \nNIC Funny how someone conveniently forgot to tell me they were driving home on a motorcycle! \nJONI Mom... \nNIC You know how many people I've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents?! \nPAUL I'm a very safe rider... \nThey stare at each other.      It's like watching two magnets. PAUL The air is clear. \nJules grabs Paul and starts smothering him with kisses. It takes a second for Paul to get his bearings, but when he does, he starts kissing her back with equal fervor, pushing her up against the wall, wedging his hand between her legs. JULES Paul, I can't! \nPAUL You don't want to?! \nJULES No, I do! It's just... (urgent whisper) I have a guy outside! \nOvercome with lust, Jules wraps her legs around his waist and Paul walks her into... \nHIS BEDROOM \nQuick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings. Somewhere between slapstick and animal. He pulls her hair back hard. She loves it. She pulls his hair back harder. He yelps. She pulls down his underwear. Her eyes widen. It's been decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh. \nJULES Oh.   Well.     Hel-lo! \nCut to them fucking. It's gawky and passionate.    Somewhere in the middle of it, Jules starts laughing. PAUL What? \nJULES Nothing. Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more. \nShe keeps laughing. Paul goes harder to make her stop. The paces grows quicker. They're getting closer. And then... \nLUIS (O.S.) Hello?   Excuse me, Senora Allgood?! They stop mid-thrust. \nJULES You gotta be fucking kidding me! She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously. \nINT./EXT.   PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY Jules runs out to meet Luis, waiting patiently at the door. \nJULES What's up? \nLUIS Where do you want the stones? \nJULES (catching her breath) The stones? Over by the fence. \nLuis stares at his employer. She looks totally disheveled. Jules starts feeling her hair, smoothing it into shape. \nJULES (CONT'D) (defensive) What? I was using the bathroom. (then) Do you need to use the bathroom? \nLuis stares at her feet.       She looks down.   She's barefoot. \nEXT. PUBLIC PARK - DAY \nPaul and Laser shoot hoop. There's a tense-ness to their patter. Laser takes the ball and steps to the top of the key and shoots. Drains it. \nLASER That's H. PAUL I know. \nLaser steps up to left side of the basket, calls his shot. LASER Lay-up. \nPAUL Hey, don't take it easy on me cause you're winning-- \nLaser does a trick behind the back lay-up.        Nails it.   Then tosses the ball to Paul. PAUL (CONT'D) Nobody likes a show-off. \nNic tightens at the mention of Paul. \nJOEL So, the kids have been spending time with him? \nNIC Oh, yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together. \nSTELLA (senses the sarcasm) Well, it's great they like him so much.   You know, you hear these stories about kids meeting their donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper. NIC No, everyone's getting along famously. Apparently Paul can do no wrong... Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm. \nNIC (CONT'D) Can we get another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet? Jules gives Nic a look.   Joel and Stella feel the tension between them. \nSTELLA Hey, have you guys tried those A\u00e7ai fruit packs? \nJULES No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods. \nSTELLA I know.    Joel's addicted. \nJOEL What I do is I throw one in the blender with some bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk and I'll tell you, it's sensational. \nNic slaps her forehead. NIC Oh, just fucking kill me... \nEveryone stiffens.   Jules is embarrassed. JULES Honey... \nNIC I'm sorry guys, but I just can't, with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming and heirloom tomatoes. (mocking-voice) \"Oh no, don't throw that in the trash, no man, you gotta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves.\" God! What a bunch of bullshit! \nNic takes a big swallow from her glass.   Jules windshield wipes Nic's forearm. \nJULES (sotto) How about some green tea, honey... Nic slams her glass on the table.   Explodes. \nNIC You know what, Jules?! I like my wine! Okay? So fucking sue me! And fyi, red wine has a chemical called Resveratrol in it, which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan! \nJULES Yeah, if you drink a thousand bottles a day! \nNIC Fuck you. Nic storms off.   Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen. \nJULES I'm sorry. \nINT. RESTAURANT BAR - MINUTES LATER \nJules walks over to the bar. Nic is sitting in the corner. JULES What the hell is going on with you? \nNIC This whole Paul thing is driving me crazy! I feel like he's taking over my family. \nJules tries to bring it down.   She yells in hushed tones. JULES No. He's not! \nNIC (nerves fraying) Okay! Okay. I'm sorry.      I'm just exhausted... \nJULES Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge. \nNIC (self-pitying) Sure, and who's gonna pay for that? Jules looks pissed off, and hurt. \nNIC (CONT'D) Look, I'm sorry, I just feel like I'm carrying the whole load here. \nPaul grabs Jules' wrist and mouths \"wait!\"   Jules rips her arm free and walks out. \nMOMENTS LATER - JULES \nwalks outside and is stunned to find Luis already back from Home Depot, sneezing and wiping his nose. \nJULES Did you go to Home Depot? LUIS Yeah.   I just got back. \nJULES That was fast! \nLUIS Yeah, no lines. \nHis look of confusion trips off her paranoia.      She's convinced he knows everything. \nJULES What's that look? LUIS What look? JULES The look you're giving me right now! LUIS That's no look.     That just my face. \nJULES Look, I'm not gonna play this game with you! You need to keep your judgements to yourself! \nLUIS Senora, I didn't give no looks! JULES I don't ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly! I mean, if you have a drug problem that's your business... \nLUIS I don't have no drug problem! I have the allergies! JULES Then why are you a gardener?! \nLuis stares at Jules, innocent. LUIS Cause I love the flowers. \nJULES Look, this isn't gonna work. I'll pay you through the end of the day and then we're done. \nJules walks past a totally confused Luis. \nINT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJules lies on her side. Nic shuffles to get to close to her. Jules moves away, still pissed at her. Nic realizes she needs to make amends. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING The family sits in silence, having breakfast.     Nic looks around the table, feeling like a pariah. NIC Look, I know you've all been enjoying your time with Paul. And I know I haven't been as open to him as everyone else and this has caused some...friction...between us. But I'd like to try and change that... Everyone keeps eating, uncommitted.   \"And...?\" \nNIC (CONT'D) So I was thinking. Maybe it would be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime. That way, I could get to know him a little better, and I could see all the good work mom's been doing with his backyard. Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods.     They recognize this is a big step for Nic. \nOMITTED \nEXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY \nPaul walks out to check on Jules. She's sweating her ass off, shlepping stacks of heavy mulch across the yard. \nPAUL How's it going? JULES Okay... \nPAUL Here, let me help. \nPaul takes some of her load and together they transport the sod to the other side of the yard. Neither know what to say. \nPaul stares at her, waiting for her lead. \nJULES We can't be doing this... \nPAUL Hey. It's hard enough to open your heart in this world. Don't make it harder. LASER You're right. (to Nic; contrite) I'm sorry, mom. Nic looks at Paul.    Stunned.   Then looks at Jules and points to Paul. \nNIC I like this guy. \nPaul looks at Joni. \nPAUL You didn't tell me you were named after Joni M. \nJONI It's just so dorky. I don't really like to bring it up. \nPAUL I think it's cool. NIC (getting up) Hey Paul. Where's your bathroom? \nPAUL Just around there. \nOn her way to the loo, Nic turns back to Paul. \nNIC You know what? I think I will try some of that Screaming Eagle. \nINT. PAUL'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNic washes her hands at the sink. Something catches her eye. She lifts Paul's hairbrush from the shelf in front of her and examines it. She reaches into the bristles and pulls out... \nA few strands of long red hair. \nNic pales. \nCUT TO Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell- tale red hair from the drain. \nCUT TO Nic skulks out of the bathroom.   She looks out and b-lines for the bedroom. \nCUT TO Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed.   Her look tells us she's found hair here as well. \nTHEN WE CUT TO Nic sitting back down at the table. She looks drained. Nobody notices. The sound drops out. \nNIC'S POV: Paul and Jules talking comfortably. \nJoni and Laser chiming in, smiling, one big happy family. REVERSE ONTO NIC: \nTotally disconnected. Shell-shocked. She wants to scream but it feels like she's trapped in cement. Things slow way down... \nOMITTED \nINT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT Nic and Jules perform their nightly ablutions.   Jules is sonic-caring her teeth. \nJULES (through the sonic buzz) Well, you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters... \nNIC You're sleeping with him, aren't you. JULES (freaked) What? \nNic turns to her, eyes red with anger. \nNIC Just be honest with me. Don't make me feel crazier than I feel right now! \nJULES (fighting the impulse to push it) Okay then. Go back to sleep. \nJules pats her son and leaves. \nINT. JONI'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nJules enters and touches Joni's shoulder. JULES Joni? \nJONI I don't want to talk to you. \nJULES Can we just-- \nJONI I said I don't want to talk to you!! \nJULES Okay.   I'm sorry. \nJules slowly retreats to the door. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING \nJules drinks coffee at the table. Nic walks in, dressed for work. Jules looks at her, wanting to \"process.\" But Nic isn't in the mood. She grabs a banana from a bowl and walks out. Jules feels like a leper. \nOMITTED. \nINT. SASHA'S ROOM - AFTERNOON \nWe can tell Joni's been crying and downloading the whole thing to Sasha. SASHA How's Nic doing? \nJONI She's a wreck. I've never seen her like this before. \nJoni's cell rings. She gets off the bed, looks at the phone. It's a picture of Paul. SASHA Is it him...? \nJoni nods gravely, answers. JONI (cold) Hello. \nEXT. PAUL'S FARM - AFTERNOON \nPaul's walking through rows of swiss chard, cell phone to his ear. \nConversation Intercut. \nPAUL Hey Joni, how you doing? \nJONI You're such a phony. \nBeat. \nPAUL Excuse me? \nJONI You act like you're so groovy and together but you're not. You're a shitty person! \nPAUL What happened? JONI With my mom?! \nJONI You're excused. (then back to Jai) Hey, can I talk to you? \nJoni leads Jai to a private corner. \nShe leans in and kisses Jai. And Jai actually returns the kiss. And it's completely sweet and intimate. \nBut then the kiss starts to morph as Joni's energy turns manic, intense, less romantic than emotionally needy. We see Jai start to pull away. But Joni keeps holding him, wanting more. Finally, Jai breaks off the kiss. \nJAI Joni...Joni... \nJONI What? \nJoni looks pained, embarrassed.      Jai keeps holding her hands. JAI Are you okay? \nJONI Yeah, I'm fine... Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her wake. \nINT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJules walks in to find Nic, awake, in bed. \nJULES Just getting another pillow.   The couch is kind of saggy. \nNIC Is your back okay? Jules perks up: is this an invitation to share the bed again? \nJULES It's a little ache-y. NIC You should take some Advil. \nGuess not. Suddenly they hear bumping and loud footsteps downstairs. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJules walks downstairs to find Joni stumbling toward her bedroom. \nJULES Hey.    How was the party? \nJoni tries to avert her mom's questioning gaze. \nJONI Fine. \nJULES How big was it? JONI I don't know. Medium...ish... \nJules takes in the glassy look in her daughter's eyes. JULES Are you drunk? \nJONI No. Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece. \nNIC I hope you had a designated driver. JONI Why?    I'm not drunk. \nNIC Well, you seem drunk to me. \nJONI Yeah, well, you should know. NIC (furious; incredulous) What did you just say to me?! \nJONI I'm going to bed. \nJONI I don't know... Joni looks down welling up. \nJONI (CONT'D) I just wish you could've been... PAUL What? \nJoni chokes back tears. JONI Better... \nPaul and Joni look up at each other when the door suddenly flings open. Nic is there, fuming. \nNIC You've got some balls, mister! \nPAUL Nic, hold on... \nNic walks toward he and Joni.   Joni ducks back inside. \nNIC No, you hold on! Let me tell you something, you really hurt my kids! PAUL Well, they're kinda my... \nNIC (cutting him off) No! They're not. This is not your family. This is my family! You're just a fucking interloper... Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand. \nPAUL I didn't mean to hurt anyone... Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace. \nNIC If you want a family so much, go out and make one of your own! Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her. \nPaul stand alone, spinning. After a moment he spontaneously looks back into the house. Laser is staring at him through the window. Their eyes lock and Paul give Laser a contrite smile. That's the final straw for Laser. He grabs his plate and walks out of view. \nReeling, Paul heads for his motorcycle. He gets on the bike, helmet in hand. Turns on the ignition. He picks up the helmet and pauses, shaking in the hell of his own making. Losing it, he hurls the helmet at the motorcycle. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - THAT NIGHT \nLaser, Joni and Nic watch \"Locked Up Abroad\" Jules walks in front of them, picks up the remote and turns off the TV. JULES I need to say something. \nEveryone sits up.   Jules acts stoic but she's wrecked. \nJULES (CONT'D) Look, it's no big secret your mom and are in hell right now. Bottom line...marriage is hard...really fucking hard. Just two people, slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing. It's a fucking marathon, okay?! Everyone is silenced by the outpouring.   Jules soldiers on. \nJULES (CONT'D) So sometimes you're together so long, you just stop seeing the other person. You just see weird projections of your own junk. And instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails, and act grubby and make stupid choices. Which is what I did. And I feel sick about it because I love you guys and I love your mom and that's the truth. Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why. Maybe if I read more Russian novels I would... \nNic looks down, overwhelmed by it all. JULES (CONT'D) Anyway, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about what I did and that I hope you'll forgive me eventually. (awkward) Thank you. \nAnd, without further ado, Jules hands the remote back to Laser and departs the field. Everyone's silenced by Jules' rambling apologia, especially Nic. \nOMITTED. \nINT. JONI'S ROOM - MORNING \nJoni wakes up. She looks around her room. There's nothing on the walls. The floor is covered with boxes taped and labeled. It's time to go. \nEXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY \nNic and Jules stuff the last of Joni's things in the back of their station wagon. Laser and Joni bring the last of the boxes out of the house. \nINT. VOLVO STATION WAGON - DAY The Allgoods are on the road, heading to college. \n", "test1_input": "THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT \nWritten by \nLisa Cholodenko & Stuart Blumberg \nAugust 3,2009 \nFADE UP ON: \nThe humming stillness of an American suburb on a summer's day: nannies push strollers, joggers jog, mailmen deliver, dogs are walked, kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways. \nOn a quiet, tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic- looking boys riding bikes. LASER ALLGOOD (15) and his friend, CLAY (15). \nLike bats out of hell they pass block after block of charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house. \nINT. CLAY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER They walk inside.   We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another room. \nINT. CLAY'S, BATHROOM - LATER \nClay pounds on blue pills with a hammer, reducing them to powder. Laser watches. LASER I don't know, dude. \nClay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card. CLAY B minus in geometry, yo!   This shits the bomb! \nClay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort.   Then hands the rolled up bill to Laser. \nCLAY (CONT'D) Add it up, son. Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD (18). It's her room. She pours over a game of Scrabble. \nSitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, SASHA, (18). Sasha's checking out Joni's FACEBOOK PAGE. \nJoni's best guy friend, JAI (18) sits across from her, calculating his next Scrabble move. \nSASHA Oh my God, Joni, there are so many hotties in your class. You are so gonna hook up the first week. \nJAI Just cause you're a 24 hour drive- thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be... \nSASHA Hey, she worked her ass off! She deserves some hot jock sausage! Jai looks repulsed, and hurt. \nSASHA (CONT'D) (flip) Whatever. Why don't you guys just do it and get it over with? \nJoni and Jai blush. They're both too scared to admit their crush on each other. SASHA (CONT'D) What? I'm just asking. \nJAI Uh, maybe because we're friends... \nSASHA Oh, really...? Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur. \nINT. CLAY'S HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad looks back, menacing. \nCLAY'S FATHER Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch. \n", "test1_true": "The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the brutal play. Clay laughs manically. \nCLAY Let me go! \nCLAY'S FATHER Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. CLAY Dad, your pits smell like burnt ass! Get off me! As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son, we note a trace of longing on his face. \nOMITTED. \nOMITTED. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM \nJoni, Laser and JULES ALLGOOD (40's) fair-skinned, attractive, sit before well prepared dinner. Still buzzing, Laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table. JONI Laser!   Knock it off! \nLASER What?!   I'm not doing anything. \nEXT. HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - MAGIC HOUR NIC ALLGOOD (late 40's) pulls up into the driveway beside a beat up white TRUCK covered in AA slogan bumper stickers. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING Nic enters.   Drops her bag and heads for the table. \nNIC Hi guys.   Sorry I'm late. \nJULES Don't worry. We just started. \nNIC 27 fibroids. All in the lining. \nShe kisses Jules. \nJULES Honey, that's disgusting.   We're eating. JONI Did you do that laparoscopically? \nNIC That's right, Smart Girl.   And we got `em all. \nAs Nic settles in... NIC (CONT'D) Hey, whose truck is that? \nJULES Mine. NIC Yours? \nJULES For the business. \nNIC What business?.. (getting edgy) The gardening? \nJONI (protective) Isn't it landscaping. JULES Yes, thank you very much. \nNIC (strained) Okay... (then) Do we have any Cabarnet left? JULES I didn't look, honey. \nNic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine.   Laser's cell phone RINGS. He answers it. \nLASER Hey, what's up? \nJules puts her hand on Laser's arm. \n", "test2_input": "They both laugh.    Nic's funny sometimes. \nEXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - ECHO PARK - DAY \nJules drives slowly up the hill looking for Paul's address. She sees the house and pulls in the driveway next to an old truck and a motorcycle. \nEXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY \nJules and Paul walk through Paul's backyard, evaluating. JULES ...We could do a kind of a Secret Garden thing with trellises and topiary... (clocking his face) ...or something more Asian, minimal, with a rock garden feel. It's up to you... PAUL What do you think? \nJULES Personally, I'm tired of minimal. I'm into more is more. Let's not try to tame the space. I think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund... PAUL Fecund? \nJULES I'm sorry, you know, fertile... \nPAUL No, I love that word. You just don't hear it that often. (thinking) More is more. Yeah. Let's do that. \nJules is staring at Paul. \nPAUL (CONT'D) What? \nJULES Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids in your expressions... \nJules looks more intensely at Paul's face. JULES (CONT'D) You and Laser have the same mouth. \nPAUL You think so? \nJULES Yeah. The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected. \nEXT. BACKYARD - ALLGOOD HOUSE - EVENING Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese take-out for the family dinner. \nNIC What's the score? \nJULES Pretty close. Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules. \nLASER 20-3...match point. NIC So how'd it go today? \nJULES Great.   We settled on a concept. \nNIC What is it? \nJULES It's hard to explain. You have to kind of see the space to get it. \nNIC (to Laser) Laser, did you write Pup-pup a Get Well card? (off his silence) Laser! What do I have to do?! I bought you a card. I left it on your desk. All you had to do was-- LASER Mom, settle! I will... \nNIC Don't tell me to settle, mister. And if it's not in the mail by tomorrow morning, we're not going to the Dodger game Saturday. \nLASER Whatever, I have other plans anyway. \nNIC What other plans? (off his silence) I'm asking you a quest-- \nLASER I said I'd do something with Paul! Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells: \n", "test2_true": "EXT. ALLEY - DAY We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something.   Laser is holding a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA. \nPAUL This may not be a good idea. \nCLAY (O.S.) Are you filming?! \nWe cut to Clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall. He's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land his board on the ground. \nPAUL (to Laser) He's not gonna make it. (calling to Clay) Clay, you're not gonna make it! \nLASER I think he may be right, dude. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. CLAY Will you quit being a man-gina and run the camera! I'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame! Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser, wondering why he puts up with this guy. \nVIDEO CAMERA'S POV: We watch as Clay psychs himself up   with an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps. Finally,   he starts down the ledge. He starts his jump, catches air   and hits the edge of the dumpster and falls. We see him go   into the dumpster and land with a nauseating THUD. Paul and   Laser rush up and look over the edge. PAUL/LASER ARE YOU OKAY?! \nThere's Clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony. CLAY Did you get that?! \nLASER Seriously, dude, are you okay? \nCLAY I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you fucking get it?! \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE CLAY'S HOUSE - LATER \nPaul and Laser walk over to Paul's truck. \nPAUL Maybe next time we can hang out just you and me. LASER Clay's cool. He's just gets a little amped sometimes. \nPAUL That's not amped.    That's being a dick. LASER He's not a dick, that's just his way. PAUL Okay...I just didn't like the way he was talking to you. \nLASER (defensive) Well, you don't know him. \nPAUL (back-peddling) You're right...I don't... \nLASER Hey, can I ask you a question? PAUL Sure. \nLASER Why'd you donate sperm? PAUL Well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood. Laser doesn't laugh.    Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a \"non-joke\" answer. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I don't know, I guess I thought, you know, if I can help somebody in need, somebody who wants a baby... \nLaser's not really buying that. LASER So you did it to help people? \nPAUL It was a long time ago... \nLASER How much did you get paid? \nPAUL Why do you want to know? LASER I'm just curious. PAUL I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop. \nLASER That's it? \nPAUL It was worth more back then.     You know. With inflation... (off Laser's look) Hey, I'm glad I did it... \n", "test3_input": "Tanya's face drops. \nTANYA What happened? \nPAUL You know, our thing is really fun and easy, but...I don't want to be 50 and still \"hanging out.\" You know? If I really want a family then I have to stop getting in these situations that don't go anywhere. Paul just looks at her.   Tanya gets it. \nTANYA (welling up) Oh. \nPaul knows enough to say nothing.      Tanya gets up and walks off. TANYA (CONT'D) Fuck you. \nPaul sits there, feeling like an asshole. \nEXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR \nThe family packs into the Volvo to head to Paul's. \nINT. PAUL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MAGIC HOUR \nPaul gets dinner ready with Joni and Laser as his sous-chefs. Both kids seem really jazzed to be cooking with him. \nIN THE BACKYARD -EVENING \nJules tours Nic around the backyard, looking a little freaked out as she shows her the work she's been doing. \nJULES I'm gonna do some planting over there so it won't look so bare... \nNIC It looks great, honey. Very indigenous. I'm so proud of you. \nNic kisses Jules spontaneously. Jules looks nauseous again. They head back up the stairs, toward Paul's house. NIC (CONT'D) Hey, so how's that guy Luis working out? \nJULES Oh, I had to fire him. \nNIC (surprised) Really?! JULES Yeah, he had a drug problem. \nNIC Whoa.   What kind of drugs? \nJULES Blow, I think... \nINT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER \nNic flips through Paul's album collection, including Joni Mitchell's Blue. \nINT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nEveryone digs into the meal, enjoying themselves.   Especially Nic, who's committed to redeeming herself. \nPAUL Hey Nic, I think you're gonna love this `98 Screaming Eagle. NIC You know what, I think I'm gonna stick with water tonight. But thank you so much. The Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first. \nNIC (CONT'D) God, Paul, this steak is delicious. What's the seasoning? \nPAUL I just mist it with a little truffle oil. \n", "test3_true": "JULES (taken aback by Nic's cheerfulness) Mmm-hmmm. \nNIC And it's done to perfection. \nPAUL So it's not too rare? NIC No, it's perfect. Juicy. Tender. Exactly what rare's supposed to be. \nPAUL Good. A lot of people in the restaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red. NIC Ugh, isn't that annoying? That happens to me all the time when I'm grilling. \nPAUL Don't people know that rare means red? NIC Right?!   It means bloody! \nPAUL Exactly! They should see what rare looks like in Argentina. The cow's practically still mooing. Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in.   Joni tries to insert herself in the conversation. \nJONI I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos Aires is supposed to be-- \nNIC (interrupting) ...So Paul, I was checking out your album collection over there. Quite the eclectic mix... \nPAUL Thanks... \nNIC You don't meet too many straight guys who love Joni Mitchell. Joni glares at Nic: stop being such a Paul hog. \nPAUL Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan? NIC (smug) Not really. We just named our daughter after her. PAUL Cool. Right on... \nNIC What's your favorite Joni album? \nPAUL I think I have to go with \"Blue.\" Nic raises her hand in a testify. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Yeah?   You too? \nThey high-five across the table. \nNIC Oh God, I probably spent half of high school in my room crying to that album. That record kills me. \nPAUL I know, it never lets up, you got \"River,\" \"California...\" \nNIC \"A Case of You...\" PAUL \"All I Want..\" \nNIC Mmm!! \nNic pulls her hands to her chest, shuts her eyes...and starts to sing. NIC (CONT'D) I am on a lonely road and I am traveling traveling, traveling, traveling/Looking for something, what can it be/Oh I hate you some, I hate you some/I love you some Oh I love you/when I forget about me... \nJules, Paul and the kids watch, open-mouthed as Nic soldiers on, skipping ahead to another verse. \nNIC (CONT'D) I want to talk to you/I want to shampoo you/I want to renew you again and again/Applause, applause/ Life is our cause/When I think of your kisses/My mind see-saws... \nNic takes a breath. Just as Paul's about to say something, Nic resumes her unfortunate solo. \nNIC (CONT'D) Do you see/do you see/do you see how you hu-urt me baby/so I hurt you too/then we both get/soo-ooo- ooo blue... \nNic stops, eyes still closed. She's connected to a part of herself she rarely lets herself visit. The moment is punctured by her smart-ass 15-year-old son. LASER Don't quit your day job, mom. \n"}

{"test1_input": "THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT \nWritten by \nLisa Cholodenko & Stuart Blumberg \nAugust 3,2009 \nFADE UP ON: \nThe humming stillness of an American suburb on a summer's day: nannies push strollers, joggers jog, mailmen deliver, dogs are walked, kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways. \nOn a quiet, tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic- looking boys riding bikes. LASER ALLGOOD (15) and his friend, CLAY (15). \nLike bats out of hell they pass block after block of charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house. \nINT. CLAY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER They walk inside.   We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another room. \nINT. CLAY'S, BATHROOM - LATER \nClay pounds on blue pills with a hammer, reducing them to powder. Laser watches. LASER I don't know, dude. \nClay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card. CLAY B minus in geometry, yo!   This shits the bomb! \nClay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort.   Then hands the rolled up bill to Laser. \nCLAY (CONT'D) Add it up, son. Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD (18). It's her room. She pours over a game of Scrabble. \nSitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, SASHA, (18). Sasha's checking out Joni's FACEBOOK PAGE. \nJoni's best guy friend, JAI (18) sits across from her, calculating his next Scrabble move. \nSASHA Oh my God, Joni, there are so many hotties in your class. You are so gonna hook up the first week. \nJAI Just cause you're a 24 hour drive- thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be... \nSASHA Hey, she worked her ass off! She deserves some hot jock sausage! Jai looks repulsed, and hurt. \nSASHA (CONT'D) (flip) Whatever. Why don't you guys just do it and get it over with? \nJoni and Jai blush. They're both too scared to admit their crush on each other. SASHA (CONT'D) What? I'm just asking. \nJAI Uh, maybe because we're friends... \nSASHA Oh, really...? Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur. \nINT. CLAY'S HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad looks back, menacing. \nCLAY'S FATHER Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch. \n", "test1_true": "The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the brutal play. Clay laughs manically. \nCLAY Let me go! \nCLAY'S FATHER Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. CLAY Dad, your pits smell like burnt ass! Get off me! As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son, we note a trace of longing on his face. \nOMITTED. \nOMITTED. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM \nJoni, Laser and JULES ALLGOOD (40's) fair-skinned, attractive, sit before well prepared dinner. Still buzzing, Laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table. JONI Laser!   Knock it off! \nLASER What?!   I'm not doing anything. \nEXT. HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - MAGIC HOUR NIC ALLGOOD (late 40's) pulls up into the driveway beside a beat up white TRUCK covered in AA slogan bumper stickers. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING Nic enters.   Drops her bag and heads for the table. \nNIC Hi guys.   Sorry I'm late. \nJULES Don't worry. We just started. \nNIC 27 fibroids. All in the lining. \nShe kisses Jules. \nJULES Honey, that's disgusting.   We're eating. JONI Did you do that laparoscopically? \nNIC That's right, Smart Girl.   And we got `em all. \nAs Nic settles in... NIC (CONT'D) Hey, whose truck is that? \nJULES Mine. NIC Yours? \nJULES For the business. \nNIC What business?.. (getting edgy) The gardening? \nJONI (protective) Isn't it landscaping. JULES Yes, thank you very much. \nNIC (strained) Okay... (then) Do we have any Cabarnet left? JULES I didn't look, honey. \nNic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine.   Laser's cell phone RINGS. He answers it. \nLASER Hey, what's up? \nJules puts her hand on Laser's arm. \n", "test1_id": 2079, "test2_input": "LASER See what he did there, mom? You said \"food-services industry,\" then he said \"food-services industry...\" NIC Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks. (apropos of nothing) So, Paul, what about your social life? \nPAUL My social life? NIC You know, are you married, divorced, seeing anyone? \nJONI Mom! \nNIC What?   We're getting to know Paul. PAUL No, never been married or divorced. I date a little, but I'm just kind of focused on my work right now. NIC Oh. \nPaul wants a break from the heat. PAUL So, how'd you guys meet? \nJules smiles, embarrassed.   Nic jumps in. NIC We met at UCLA. I was a resident in the ER and Jules had an emergency. JULES My tongue went numb. \nPAUL Really? \nTHUD!   We turn to see Laser, pounding his head on the table. \nJULES Laser, that's not nice. \nLASER What's not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story 1000 times! PAUL (ignoring Laser) What happened to your tongue? JULES I don't know. I just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and I thought I might gag and then, you know... PAUL Choke?    Die?... \nJULES Yeah...exactly... \nNIC Well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and she'd be fine. \nPAUL So what'd you do for her? NIC Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get her to relax, talk, move her tongue around. LASER Mom, that's gross! \nJULES (ignoring Laser, to Nic) Actually, she started teasing me and that really helped. \nNIC I was trying to distract you. \nJULES I know. And it worked. You were really funny. NIC You were really pretty. \nNic reaches over and caresses Jules' hand.   Joni rolls her eyes, embarrassed. \nJULES So that's it. My tongue started working again. \nNIC And we've been glued at the hip ever since. \nPAUL That's a great story. JULES (beaming) We like it. \nLaser and Joni share a look. PAUL So Nic, I know you're a doctor. How `bout you, Jules? What do you do? Jules never likes this question. \nJULES Well, I, you know, I studied architecture in college... \nPAUL Right... JULES But I'm not an architect. I mean I was on my way to becoming one. But I quit before the kids were born. PAUL Well, that happens... \nJULES When they got a little older, I started a Balinese furniture import business... \nPAUL Right on. \nJULES Yeah.   But that didn't work out. \n", "test2_true": "PAUL Good for you. What kind? JULES Landscape design... (before he can respond) But not like a gardener! I mean, yes, there's a gardening component to it, but the real work is to create unique, eco-friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment. Do you know what I mean? PAUL Absolutely. \nIn Nic's mind, Jules is drowning in verbiage.   So she jumps in to save her. \nNIC Hey Paul, did Joni tell you about her graduation speech? PAUL No, she didn't. \nNIC It was incredible. So full of wisdom and hope... (turning to her Joni) Hon, go get it. I'm sure he'd love to hear it... JONI (blushing) No, mom, I'm sure he wouldn't... \nNIC Sure he would.   Come on.   Go get it... JONI (getting upset) No, it's okay... \nNIC Sweetie, don't be embarrassed. \nJONI I'm not embarrassed!   Jesus!     Give it a rest already! \nThis outburst stuns Nic into silence. Her daughter has never spoken to her like this. Laser stands up. \nLASER I'll get the ice-cream. JONI (standing up) I'll help you. \nJoni and Laser leave the room. Nic pours herself the last of Paul's Petit Syrah. Jules smiles, covering her anxiety. \nJULES (softly) Honey, that's your forth glass. NIC Actually, it's my third.    But thanks for counting. Paul turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood. \nPAUL Hey, I was just thinking. You know, I bought this place last year and the backyard's a wreck. Would you be interested in working on it? \nJULES (insecure) Oh, that's okay. \nPAUL No, seriously. I don't have time to work on it myself. \nJULES Thank you. That's really sweet. Why don't you think about it. PAUL Why?  I just did. (then) I mean, if you're not up for it that's okay-- \nJULES (jumping on it) No! I am! (getting excited) I'm up for it!... Jules smiles at Nic: \"Isn't this great?   My first client.\" Nic looks less than pleased. \nOMITTED. \nINT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY \nNic pushes a cart piled high with gardening supplies. Jules grabs a couple BAGS of fertilizer, throws them on top. \nNIC ...I'm just saying, the plan was to limit his involvement-- JULES You're unbelievable. You're all over me about getting clients, I finally get one and you're-- NIC He's not just a client, Jules. He's our sperm donor! Have you ever heard the phrase \"Don't Shit Where You Eat?\" \nJULES Yes, and I think it's disgusting. The two separate, go down separate isles.     When they rejoin, Nic is contrite. \nNIC I'm sorry. He just seemed sort of...self-satisfied to me. \nJules grabs the olive branch. \nJULES Yeah, he was working the whole \"alternative\" thing pretty hard. \nNIC (mimicking) \"I just need to get outside and `do' things, not sit on my ass and learn. But that's just me. I'm weird that way.\" \n", "test2_id": 2080, "test3_input": "JULES (fighting the impulse to push it) Okay then. Go back to sleep. \nJules pats her son and leaves. \nINT. JONI'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nJules enters and touches Joni's shoulder. JULES Joni? \nJONI I don't want to talk to you. \nJULES Can we just-- \nJONI I said I don't want to talk to you!! \nJULES Okay.   I'm sorry. \nJules slowly retreats to the door. \nINT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING \nJules drinks coffee at the table. Nic walks in, dressed for work. Jules looks at her, wanting to \"process.\" But Nic isn't in the mood. She grabs a banana from a bowl and walks out. Jules feels like a leper. \nOMITTED. \nINT. SASHA'S ROOM - AFTERNOON \nWe can tell Joni's been crying and downloading the whole thing to Sasha. SASHA How's Nic doing? \nJONI She's a wreck. I've never seen her like this before. \nJoni's cell rings. She gets off the bed, looks at the phone. It's a picture of Paul. SASHA Is it him...? \nJoni nods gravely, answers. JONI (cold) Hello. \nEXT. PAUL'S FARM - AFTERNOON \nPaul's walking through rows of swiss chard, cell phone to his ear. \nConversation Intercut. \nPAUL Hey Joni, how you doing? \nJONI You're such a phony. \nBeat. \nPAUL Excuse me? \nJONI You act like you're so groovy and together but you're not. You're a shitty person! \nPAUL What happened? JONI With my mom?! \n", "test3_true": "JONI What's wrong with you?! PAUL Joni... \nJONI Don't call me anymore. Joni hangs up and start crying.    Sasha hugs her. \nEXT. PAUL'S FARM - CONTINUOUS Sweaty, nauseous with remorse, Paul turns around to find fetching young Brooke, waiting for him with a wicker basket of huge cucumbers. BROOKE Hey Paul, look at these cukes... \nPaul holds up his hand at her.   This girl symbolizes every bad choice he's ever made. \nHe gives her the universal, \"Leave Me Alone\" gesture.   Brooke looks embarrassed. \nEXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - BACKYARD - AFTERNOON Jules sits on a lawn chair smoking a cigarette.    Her cell rings. She answers. \nEXT. STREET - AFTERNOON \nPaul walks down the street, wigging out. PAUL Hey, it's me. I just talked to Joni. Conversation intercut. \nJULES Oh my god, I'm so sorry.   I should have called you. Jules sucks a big, anxious drag off a cigarette. \nPAUL What happened? JULES Nic saw my hair in your bathroom. \nPAUL The other night. \nJULES Yeah. PAUL Fuck... \nJULES Yeah. Beat. \nPAUL Listen, it's all out in the open now. Let's make this happen. \nJULES Paul... \nPAUL No, I'm serious. Fuck it. Let's get the kids together and do this thing. \nJULES Paul, come on... \nPAUL No! I'm sick of this life. I want a family. I'm ready-- \nJULES (eye rolling) Jesus, Paul! I'm gay! \nJules tosses the phone away from her. \nEXT. HOUSE PARTY - BACKYARD - NIGHT \nJoni and Sasha stand at the makeshift \"bar\".    Joni's downs several Tequila shots quickly. SASHA Slow down, tiger. \nAcross the room, Joni spots Jai chatting with a WAIFY GIRL in a sundress. \nJoni drops one more Tequila shot and walks up to Jai and Waify girl, interrupting them. JONI I like the scruff.   It's sexy. \nWaify girl juts out her hip territorially. WAIFY GIRL Uh, `scuuuse me... \n", "test3_id": 2081}

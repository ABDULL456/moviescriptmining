GRACE Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me? (to Selfridge) You need to muzzle your dog! 
SELFRIDGE Can we just take this down a couple notches, please. 
JAKE (to Quaritch) You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her. 
Jake nods to Grace to continue. 
GRACE (to Selfridge) This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine. 
SELFRIDGE You know what? You throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern. 
GRACE I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here -- I'm talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest. 
SELFRIDGE (FRUSTRATED) Which is what exactly? 
Grace's nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions -- the need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific rigor. 
GRACE (to Jake) I can't do this. How am I supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate? 
JAKE Just tell him what you know in your heart. 
She turns to Parker, steeling herself. 
GRACE Alright, look -- I don't have the answers yet, I'm just now starting to even frame the questions. What we think we know -- is that there's some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees. Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora -- 
SELFRIDGE That's a lot I'm guessing. 
GRACE That's more connections than the human brain. You get it? It's a network -- a global network. And the Na'vi can access it -- they can upload and download data -- memories -- at sites like the one you destroyed. 
SELFRIDGE What the hell have you people been smoking out there? They're just. Goddamn. Trees. 
GRACE You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth of this world isn't in the ground -- it's all around us. The Na'vi know that, and they're fighting to defend it. If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them. 
QUARITCH We understand them just fine.   Thanks to Jake here. 
Jake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a NEW CLIP on the main monitor -- 
TIGHT ON MONITOR -- VIDEO-LOG IMAGE of Jake, looking haggard and borderline deranged, rambling in a late-night monologue. 
JAKE (RECORDED) They're not going to give up their home -- they're not gonna make a deal. For what? Lite beer and shopping channel? There's nothing we have that they want. We're a horror to them. We're the monsters from space. 
JAKE watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the people he has grown to love. 
JAKE (RECORDED) They're never going to leave Hometree. 
Quaritch FREEZES the recording. 
QUARITCH Since a deal can't be made -- it gets real simple. (to Jake, icily) So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.    I might just give you a big wet kiss. 
GRACE Parker, we have to talk, like rational people. 
SELFRIDGE Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately you're out of here on the next shuttle. All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar Program, effective now. 
ON JAKE, GRACE AND NORM, speechless. SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
A WALL OF FIRE. Silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in SLOW MOTION, spears and bows held high. 
INT. OPS CENTER - MORNING 
MONITOR SCREEN IMAGE -- WAINFLEET pans a camera across the smoldering hulks of BURNED DOZERS. The toppled remains of a charred ampsuit. Dead troopers bristling with arrows. 
WAINFLEET They hit with banshees first. Set the ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast. 
Quaritch and Selfridge look on grimly. 
QUARITCH The rest of the squad? 
WAINFLEET Six bodies -- that's all of `em. And the equipment is totalled. 
SELFRIDGE Christ. 
INT. SELFRIDGE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Selfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan. 
QUARITCH I can do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous. We'll clear them out with gas first. It'll be humane. More or less. 
Selfridge sighs and rubs his face. 
QUARITCH Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is exactly the incident we needed. 
SELFRIDGE Alright, let's pull the trigger. CUT TO: 
INT. BIO LAB 
MAX and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment, under the watchful eye of armed SEC-OPS TROOPERS. JAKE, GRACE, NORM stare bleakly at each other. 
GRACE They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to trigger a response. They're fabricating this war to get what they want. 
NORM I can't believe that. 
JAKE Yup. That's how it's done. When people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it. 
TRUDY RUNS into the lab, breathless. She's wearing full flight gear and carrying her helmet. 
TRUDY Sec-ops is rolling the gunships.   They're gonna hit Hometree! 
JAKE When? 
TRUDY Now.    We're spooling up now! I gotta go. 
GRACE My God. 
Jake pumps furiously toward the door, Grace following. 
INT. OPS CENTER - DAY 
SELFRIDGE surveys the airfield, where crews swarm over the gunships, loading ordnance. He turns as JAKE and GRACE charge toward him. 
GRACE Parker, wait. Stop! These are people you're about to -- 
SELFRIDGE They're fly-bitten savages who live in a tree! Look around -- I don't know about you but I see a lot of trees. They can move. 
GRACE For God's sake, there are children in there. Babies!

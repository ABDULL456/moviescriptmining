EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN - PIER 13.  DAY. 
TRUMAN has broken away from the line of searchers, on the pretext of taking a leak.  He is standing on the edge of Pier 13, facing the harbor, his back turned to those beginning their next sweep.  Suddenly Truman ducks behind one of the green and white inflatable canopies that enclose the Wall Street Racquet Club. 
We see a close up of Truman's terrified eyes in his blackened face, staring down at the lapping water.  It triggers a montage of flashbacks.  As usual the images all appear to play on a television screen. 
TRUMAN on the CLIFF FACE at seven years old, his second grade teacher SISTER OLIVIA, a close-up of DROWNING STATISTICS at his insurance company, mesmerized by the water in the FERRY TERMINAL, seventeen-year old SYLVIA jumping in the fountain, his WATERBED rocking, and seven-year old Truman sitting on the UPTURNED BOAT in Long Island Sound crying into the darkness. 
EXT.  PIER 13.  DAY. 
TRUMAN comes back to reality.  He steels himself, shuts out the doubts and dives into the water. 
EXT.  NEW YORK HARBOR.  DAY. 
Underwater we see TRUMAN panicking at the shock of the cold sea, arms and legs flailing.  Suddenly he stops and sinks for a moment in the weight of his clothes.  Then slowly he rises to the surface and begins to swim. 
Moored in the harbor is the scaled-down replica of Columbus' flagship, The Santa Maria. 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. 
CHRISTOF is spooling through significant scenes in the history of "TRUMAN" on a preview monitor. 
He pauses on the scene of SYLVIA and TRUMAN at the fountain in Flushing Meadow Park in the show's seventeenth season. Sylvia has her finger to Truman's lips.  Christof presses "PLAY" on the mixing desk. 
SYLVIA (from monitor) You remember when you were a little boy... 
Christof fast forwards, then presses PLAY once again. 
SYLVIA ...Trust that boy... 
Christof jabs the "PAUSE" button, freezing the picture.  He recites the words to himself. 
CHRISTOF Trust that boy... (to Simeon) We're not watching the sea. 
SIMEON (confused) Why would we? 
CHRISTOF Sweep the harbor. 
EXT.  NEW YOUR HARBOR.  DAY. 
TRUMAN is at the wheel of the Santa Maria, wind filling her sails.  Covering the face of the ship's compass is Sylvia's composite picture. 
His is the only craft afloat in New York Harbor.  As the archaic vessel passes under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridget, the bridge appears on fire in the glow of the sunlight.  Truman steers around Norton Point and sets a course for the open sea - the horizon. 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. 
CHRISTOF and his colleagues concentrate on a live aerial shot on a preview monitor, skimming over the calm, featureless sea. Suddenly in the distance there appears a single sail etched against the horizon. 
SIMEON That's him! 
CHRISTOF Resume transmission. 
Simeon punches a button and the image of the sailing ship is instantly transferred to the large On-Air monitor. 
INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY. 
SYLVIA, dozing on the sofa, suddenly blinks open her eyes as the classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by the sound of a helicopte's rotor blade. 
Sylvia focuses on the screen, her breath taken away by the sight of TRUMAN at the wheel of the Santa Maria. 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. 
CHRISTOF (staring intently at the On-Air monitor) What do we have on that boat? 
Simeon scans a computer shot list.  He types in a code.  A camera from the main mast of Truman's ship activates.  Truman, unaware of the camera, is concentrating on steering the vessel. 
EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY. 
TRUMAN is out of sight of land, the sea choppier now, rising and falling beneath his boat.  He nears a large buoy bobbing clumsily in the strong swell.  An official-looking sign is attached - "DANGER.  NAVAL EXERCISES.  DO NOT ENTER."  We see an extreme close up of the nautical signpost where a disguised miniature camera tracks Truman's progress. 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. 
CHRISTOF and the other PRODUCTION STAFF watch TRUMAN from the buoy's POV as he sails by.

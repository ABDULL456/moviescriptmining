You'd take time out of your business to do that? 
MR. BLUME 
Business schmizness. 
OCTOBER MONTAGE: 
Max and Miss Cross ride in the backseat of a van full of first graders. Max is telling a story and everyone is laughing. Mr. Blume is up front quietly driving the van. One of the first graders sits in the passenger seat staring at him. They go through the front gates of the zoo. 
Miss Cross stands at the front of her classroom drawing a complicated geometric proof on the chalkboard. Max sits alone across from her nodding earnestly and taking notes. 
Max and Miss Cross play doubles against Mr. Blume and Dirk on the court in the Blume's backyard. Max coaches Miss Cross on her backhand. Mr. Blume watches her from across the net. Mrs. Blume watches all of them from an upstairs window. 
The Grover Cleveland Science Fair. Max sits proudly in front of his project. It is a paper mache tidal wave looming over a little coastal village with screaming peasants. 
Margaret Yang is across the aisle being photographed with a trophy for Best of Show. Her project is called Light, Color, Sound and Magnetism. She is staring at Max, but he doesn't notice her. 
Mrs. Whitney hands Max a geometry test. It has a C+ on it. Max looks quickly to Mrs. Whitney, surprised. She smiles and shakes his hand. 
A huge banner for the Grover Cleveland Owls is stretched across the endzone of the football field. Max, dressed in a shiny blue and grey jumpsuit, bursts through the banner and onto the field doing cartwheels and flips. The football teams scrambles out behind him. 
Max points out to different parts of the crows and yells football cheers. Dirk is sitting in between Mr. Blume and Miss Cross in the stands. Mr. Blume stares at Miss Cross. Miss Cross looks back and Mr. Blume and smiles. Dirk says significantly: 
DIRK 
Where's Mrs. Blume tonight, Mr. Blume? 
And your sons Ronny and Donny? 
MR. BLUME 
I haven't the slightest idea, Dirk. 
INT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. DAY 
Max burst through a doorway followed by a little ENTOURAGE of underclassmen that includes a sophomore named WOODY. Woody has long hair and a Led-Zepplin shirt. He is carrying a clipboard. 
They go down the hallway and quickly pass Margaret Yang. She is very nicely dressed in a grey turtleneck. 
MARGARET 
Hi, Max. 
MAX 
Hi. 
Max keeps walking. 
He stops. He turns back to Margaret Yang. He looks her up and down. She is slightly uneasy. Max looks to Woody. Woody shrugs. Max looks back to Margaret. 
MAX 
What was your name again? 
MARGARET 
Margaret Yang. 
MAX 
Are you free seventh period? 
MARGARET 
Well, I'm supposed to have guitar lessons. 
MAX 
(pause) 
Classical? 
MARGARET 
Rock. 
MAX 
You can get out of it. 
(to Woody) 
put Margaret down for 3:30 in the auditorium, Woody. 
Max turns away and walks briskly down the hall with his entourage. He calls back to Margaret: 
MAX 
And bring a headshot. 
EXT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. DAY 
A nice two story house with a wide lawn and lots of trees. Mr. Blume knocks on the front door and waits nervously. He looks around the yard with his hands in his pockets. 
The door opens. Miss Cross is holding a plate of sliced carrots. She looks at Mr. Blume curiously and smiles. 
MISS CROSS 
Hi, Herman. 
MR. BLUME 
How are you, Rosemary? 
MISS CROSS 
Fine, thanks. I just got home and I'm having a little snack. 
MR. BLUME 
Having some carrots. 
Miss Cross nods. Mr. Blume looks up at the house. 
MR. BLUME 
Nice house. 
MISS CROSS 
Yeah, This isn't mine. I'm' just kind of housesitting. 
(pause) 
Were you in the neighborhood? 
Mr. Blume nods. There is an awkward silence. 
MR. BLUME 
Didn't Max have anything planned for us today? A trip to the museum or something? 
MISS CROSS 
Did he? I thought he was rehearsing this evening. 
MR. BLUME 
Oh. That's right. His new play. He's going to be in this one, isn't he? 
Miss Cross nods. Mr. Blume shakes his head.

DAN You're right. I heard he was working for the government. Maybe it was a political killing. 
RORSCHACH Maybe. Or maybe someone's decided to kill off costumed heroes. 
DAN You don't think that's . a little paranoid? 
RORSCHACH Is that what they're saying about me now? That I'm paranoid? 
DAN I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years, even amongst his friends, if he had any. The man wasn't exactly endearing. Just because something happened to him doesn't mean it involves us. 
RORSCHACH One of our own has been murdered. I thought you might be interested. An attack on one is an attack on all of us, right? Dan hesitates. 
DAN I'm out, Rorschach. I've been out, we've all been out. Except you. You know that. 
RORSCHACH Yes. I know that. Anyways, I thought I'd let you know. Just in case. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DAN Yeah, thanks. You can take the tunnel out to the warehouse on Fleet street-- Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark TUNNEL. 
RORSCHACH I remember. Used to come here a lot. Back when we were partners. 
DAN Yeah. Those were good times, Rorschach. Great times. (more to himself) What ever happened to them? 
RORSCHACH You quit. Rorschach disappears into the SUBWAY TUNNEL, leaving Dan to reminisce alone. Dan glances at his old costume hanging. 
INT. SLEAZY MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
The kind of room you rent by the hour. Or the minute even. A cheap looking HOOKER enters with an ARMY OFFICER, giggling. She playfully pushes the Officer onto the bed. 
HOOKER So tell me what you wanna do. Sir. 
ARMY OFFICER Seeing that I don't have to be back to base till Friday--everything. He puts a stack of BILLS on the dresser. Then takes his UNIFORM off like he can't wait. The Hooker gets on top of him- --when the DOOR FLIES OFF THE HINGES. Rorschach steps in, yanks the Hooker off-- --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which Rorschach dodges. Rorschach GRABS the guy's arm, then KICKS the Officer on the side of his KNEE, tearing the joint to shreds. The Officer cries out in pain, falls to the floor-- Rorschach nails him in the head with a BLACK JACK, knocking him out. The Hooker screams. Rorschach grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her face into the wall. 
RORSCHACH Quiet, whore. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Nose broken and bleeding, the Hooker quiets to a whimper. Rorschach takes the officer's uniform and ID. Then leaves. 
EXT. VEIDT ENTERPRISES - MORNING 
A mammoth, shining skyscraper. At the 50th-floor there is a HUGE V-SHAPED HOLE where WATER FALLS. 
INT. VEIDT ENTERPRISES - LOBBY - MORNING 
A mammoth lobby. The decor is Egyptian and marble. Dan approaches a beautiful ASSISTANT behind an imposing desk. 
DAN I'm here to see Adrian Veidt. 
ASSISTANT Do you have an appointment? 
DAN No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is here to see him. 
ASSISTANT I'm sorry, Mr. Veidt doesn't see anyone without an appointment. 
DAN I understand, but if you would just tell Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here, I'm an old friend. 
ASSISTANT Well, Mr. Veidt is very busy at the 
MOMENT-- 
DAN Just tell him I'm here. I assure you he'll see me. Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken. She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office. Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by nervousness. Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him-- it's been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY GUARDS eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns. 
ASSISTANT Go on in, Mr. Dreiberg. 
INT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Dan enters the enormous office--there are three TV feeds PROJECTED onto the walls, architectural models of real estate developments, poster size ad campaigns for "Nostalgia" perfume--all reflecting the financial empire of Veidt Enterprises owned by-- --ADRIAN VEIDT, late 30s, movie star looks, is at the far end of the office, SPRINTING on a treadmill as journalist DOUG ROTH holds a tape recorder to him. Adrian sees Dan approaching, smiles wide. He holds up a finger, telling Dan to hold on a sec. Dan nods, takes a seat on the couch. Picks up a Fortune magazine with Adrian on the cover. 
DOUG ROTH Mr. Veidt, would you acknowledge that you are considered the world's smartest man? 
ADRIAN 
(LAUGHS) I think it's better to be the world's most modest man. You should ignore my PR people, they tend to be a little too enthusiastic. Though Adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed, he hardly seems out of breath as he answers questions.

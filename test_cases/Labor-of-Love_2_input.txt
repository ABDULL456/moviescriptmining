MAURICE Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult. 
FATHER I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now. 
This is the father's own room.  Very sparse as one would expect.  He moves to his bureau and retrieves some pills. 
FATHER Take these, and if you're up to it, try to explain how it is you came to be sitting here. 
Maurice follows the father's instructions and tightens the blanket around his shoulders. 
MAURICE I'm walking for my wife. 
Beat. 
FATHER To where? 
MAURICE Pacifica, California. 
FATHER From where? 
MAURICE Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
FATHER I see. 
Beat.  The father nods as if this is not shocking news. 
FATHER Why? 
MAURICE Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death? 
FATHER Most certainly. 
MAURICE And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them. 
FATHER That's a reasonable assumption. 
MAURICE I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts. 
FATHER Doubts?  About what? 
MAURICE About my love for her. 
The father nods with understanding as if everything became very clear with that statement. 
FATHER You don't have to prove anything to her. 
MAURICE I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can. 
The father studies this stranger before him with great admiration. 
MAURICE There are some people, including those officers, that are trying to stop me.  They mean well.  But they don't understand.  I wouldn't either if I were them. 
Maurice struggles with the last words.  He slumps back -- physically drained. 
The father gets up and takes the empty glass of water from Maurice's hands. 
FATHER I want you to stay here a few days until you're better.  You're no use to your wife in this condition. 
The father moves for the curtain. 
MAURICE You think I'm crazy too. 
The father turns and smiles warmly. 
FATHER I have spent my life dedicated to love.  Love of God.  Love of humanity.  And here you are living through love.  Bathing in it. Using its strength, its magic, its ability to overcome any barrier... If you are crazy, I hope my insanity is not far off. 
Maurice's eyes well up instantly.

EXT.  CHURCH - WESTERN HIGHWAY - DAY 
Father Berchman wraps one powerful hand around a tiny silver cross dangling from his neck.  The other hand waves high into the air at the shrinking figure of Maurice Parker walking through the snow.

HIGHWAY 
The long trek continues.  The black tar of the roads peek out in spots as the SUN BEATS down on the flatlands.  Maurice drapes his worn scarf around a melting snowman.

RESTAURANT 
We are looking inside a fancy Center-City Philadelphia restaurant.  Adelle and Gerald are seated by an enormous bay window.  A waiter comes to their table with their main course.  Gerald watches the food being served with great anticipation. 
Gerald's eyes drift out the window to the magazine stand on the sidewalk... He squints to see better.  Realization hits hard... His eyes light up.  He looks to Adelle and back to the magazine stand. 
In a mad race for time, Gerald begins to devour the food on his plate.  The waiter and Adelle watch him in shock.  Adelle glances out the window.  Her eyes squint... then light up. She jumps to her feet and grabs Gerald by the arm, a fork full of food drops to his plate.  Gerald looks back at his full plate longingly as Adelle pulls him out of the restaurant. 
The waiter looks out the window to the magazine stand.  He squints.

MAGAZINE STAND 
The NEW YORK TIMES are hung like stockings around the border of the stand.  On the front pages, a singular headline stands out among the others:

That evening in the hotel room, feeling things are getting better, Nora and Steven make love. However, something happens. A spirit enters Steven's body, causing his personality and actions to be altered a bit. He does and says things to her that are obviously not of his doing. Things which Nora would find baroque, to say the least. His manner of love-making is altered, but rather than Nora being turned off, she is somehow excited by this change. What in essence is happening, is that she is making love to two men at the same time. Steven, and another spirit. Some of the things which he says harp back to an old time, long, long ago.

EXT. WOODS. DAY 
An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw. He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that descends into the valley below. A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches: 
FOX What'd the doctor say? 
MRS. FOX Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty- four hour bug. He gave me some pills. 
FOX 
(REASSURINGLY) I told you. You probably just ate some bad gristle. Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the path. Fox points: 
FOX Should we take the short cut or the scenic route? 
MRS. FOX Let's take the short cut. 
FOX But the scenic route is so much prettier. 
MRS. FOX 
(SHRUGS) OK, let's take the scenic route. 
FOX Great. It's actually slightly quicker, anyway. Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off down the scenic route. 
EXT. FARM. DAY 
A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from the bushes outside a fence. 
MRS. FOX What is a squab? 
FOX You know what a squab is. It's like a pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of bird we can eat. Fox motions toward the edge of the property. 
FOX Should we go through the hole under the horse fence or climb the rail over the bridle path? 
MRS. FOX Well, I guess the horse fence would be a little safer. 
FOX But the bridle path puts us out right next to the squab shack. Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny. 
FOX What's wrong? I've never seen you like this. You're acting all skittish. Don't worry. I've been stealing birds for a living since before I could trot. 
MRS. FOX

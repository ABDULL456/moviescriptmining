WEST Hey -- watch -- 
He points toward a small black wasp flying from above. 
WEST The desert wasp... one of the world's great hunters. She'll kill the tarantula -- and lay her eggs on it, so her babies can have something to eat. 
GORDON Now I'm really hungry. (beat) How did your parents, who I assume were Negroes, feel about you being raised by Indians? 
WEST They didn't have much to say about it. I was sent to another plantation when I was little. Ran away as soon as my legs were strong enough to take me. 
West can see the effect his story has had on Gordon. 
GORDON Did you ever see your family again?

WEST Yeah... (stands, kicks out fire) They were at the camp at New Liberty. 
Now they both stare into the fire.    Finally Gordon speaks. 
GORDON I'll help you get him, Jim. 
138   EXT. UTAH - DESERT - MORNING                                   138 
West and Gordon trudge through an endless sand dune, side by side, chests out, jaws set. They're partners, goddammit! 
GORDON You have no idea where you're going, do you? 
WEST I know exactly where I'm goin' ... Spider Canyon. 
Gordon stops to catch his breath. 
WEST (stops, looks back) But I'm never gonna get there with you draggin' that damn thing around! 
Now we see Gordon's got the heavy metal collar in his hand. West grabs him and they start to walk away -- Gordon listing noticeably. 
GORDON While a magneto of this power may not inspire your scientific curiosity, it does mine. Besides, you never know when it might come in handy. 
Gordon suddenly disappears OUT OF FRAME. West stops to see what's happened to his partner now...

ANGLE - GORDON 
He's on his back, arm holding the metal doughnut straight out over his head, being dragged across the desert floor by some unseen force. 
Gordon snowplows backwards through the sand for 40 feet, finally coming to an abrupt stop with a metallic klang! 
West deadpans this bit of insanity, walks over, and with the toe of his boot, uncovers the explanation -- iron railroad tracks covered by drifting sand. 
WEST Arte... when you're right, you're right. 
GORDON Well I think our partnership is taking a big step forward. You finally admitted I was right about something. 
West helps him up. Then, as or two heroes follow the tracks into the distance... towards Spider Canyon... 
GORDON Now... how about admitting you were lost? 
WEST Don't push it. 
139   EXT. SPIDER CANYON RIM - DAY (LATER)                              139 
West and Gordon trudge past the Wanderer.     It's parked at the end of the line, looks deserted. 
GORDON Jim, I know I've hallucinated it several times before, so is that really the Wanderer? 
WEST That's the Wanderer. 
Gordon seems relieved to know his beloved train is not another mirage. They continue on to the rim of the canyon, peer over the edge. Reacting to what they see... 
GORDON And would it be too much to hope that I'm simply seeing a World's Fair down there... ? (CONTINUED)

WEST Yeah, it would. That's Loveless' Lair. 
140   EXT. SPIDER CANYON - POV FROM RIM - DAY                        140 
A natural bowl that appears to have been made by a meteor, is gouged out of the desert floor. In the bowl are several spectacular Victorian-style buildings made almost entirely of glass, plus a huge silo. Ant-sized figures are moving around. 
141   OMITTED                                                        141 
142   EXT. SPIDER CANYON - DAY                                       142 
Now they hear a strange sound. To modern ears, a WHINE as from a jet engine. Loveless appears in the f.g. He's rising on a steel platform as if on some unseen elevator. Up, up, up he goes... as now more of the contraption comes INTO VIEW. Alloy girders, multi-levels, control boards... all open in an Eiffel Tower-like effect. 
West and Gordon scramble for cover behind a rock as a giant metal Tarantula steps over the rim in full terrifying glory. Eight legs, five stories high. 
The thorax of the giant spider bristles with Gatling guns and all manner of weaponry. As the shadow of the monster passes over their faces... 
GORDON Now that's impressive. 
WEST Nice to see an invention that actually works.

GREER (VO) I swore I wouldn't do that. 
RYAN Like you swore to protect and serve? The reference brings Greer up short.       There's a moment, then: 
GREER You know a lot... 
RYAN And I'll forget a lot, too. But not until they're both out of danger. Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a SURFING WINDBREAKER; HOODED with WATERPROOF POCKETS -- but where's his cellphone? Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Your choice, man. The Martins or the DVD. Either way, I'm not hanging around any longer. You got five seconds, then I disconnect your ass. 
GREEK You sure you know what you're doing? 
RYAN One...     Two... On the other end of the phone: 
179   EXT. CAROUSEL ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS                                179 GREER wrestles with his better judgment-- 
RYAN Three...    Four... --but Ryan's got him by the balls.     Angrily, Greer lifts his walkie. 
GREER Okay! Okay. (into walkie) Hodges, put 'em on the Ferris wheel. 
HODGES (VO) What? I 
GREER Shut up and do it! 
RYAN Not bad. Most people never get past two. Greer flinches as his own taunts are used against him. 
GREER (to Ellis) Keep an eye on them. As soon as we make the trade, take the woman and her kid out. 
CUT TO: 
180   EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - BLUFF - NIGHT                            180 RYAN watches from a distance as Hodges exits the van. 
GREER (VO) Don't screw me kid, y9u won't live long enough to enjoy it. 
RYAN Oooh, I think I just pissed myself. Ryan looks optimistic when Hodges gets out and opens the back door. And just as he's on the brink of success-- 
FEMALE VOICE (OS) 
HEY--! 
A woman's HAND grabs the hood of Ryan's windbreaker and rips it away from his face. Wheels him around. It's: 
CHLOE There you are! Where the hell were you! ? 
RYAN Chloe!    Get away from here! 
CHLOE Know how many hours I waited for you to bring back those stupid shirts?! What'd you do? Sell them on the Prominade yourself--? But Ryan's got no time for this. 
RYAN 
GO!    NOW!! 
181     EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT                                    181 A sickly-looking MOONEY glances at the commotion -- and sees the hoodless Ryan. 
MOONEY (motioning to Tomlin) That's him! There he is! 
12     EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - BLUFF - NIGHT                            182 Ryan desperately tries to shoo Chloe away. 
RYAN It isn't safe to talk, get it? I -- People are after me! 
CHLOE (shrugs free) What -- are you high? Suddenly, Mooney steps up beside Ryan and grabs him. 
MOONEY (winded) I've been..looking for..you, kid-- But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys. Mooney grabs him as he tries to make a break for it. 
RYAN Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go!

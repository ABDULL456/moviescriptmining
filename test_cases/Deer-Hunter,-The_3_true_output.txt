MERLE Oh. 
MERLE nods. 
MERLE (CONT'D) (clears his throat) Uh... well, maybe you could tell us how it is over there? 
SERGEANT Pow! 
MERLE Pow? 
SERGEANT Pow! 
MERLE looks at NICK. NICK looks at SAL. They all begin scratching their heads, trying not to laugh. 
MERLE Well, thanks a lot. 
They turn away and then, when they are out of earshot, they all break up, howling. 
SAL Who the hell is he? 
MERLE Who the hell knows! 
NICK Is he from here? 
MERLE Hell no! 
NICK Well, where's he from? 
MERLE AND SAL (in unison) Who the hell knows! 
MERLE (soberly) Maybe he's lost. 
SAL AND NICK Lost??? 
MERLE (throws up his hands) Well, I don't know! 
INT. V.F.W. POST - NIGHT 
The GUESTS have formed in a long double line which extends from the dance floor right out into the street. Everyone is pretty drunk and they are all armed with streamers and bags of rice. As SAL and ANGELA appear from out of a back room there is a great rowdy CHEER. The MUSICIANS strike up a MARCH. Followed by the MUSICIANS, showered with streamers, rice, advice and encouragement, SAL and ANGELA walk the gauntlet toward the street, where a glossy, bright red Pontiac with headers and straight pipes is being revved in a series of ear-splitting crescendos. 
EXT. V.F.W. POST - STREET - NIGHT 
JOHN, ALBERT, MERLE and VINCENT are standing by the door. Their tuxedos are stained and torn. Their carnations are squashed and their clip-on bow ties are either missing entirely or dangling from the open collars of their shirts. VINCE looks the worst, with a black eye and half his pant leg torn away, and they are all guzzling beer. 
VINCE Bullshit! That's bullshit! 
MERLE You wanna bet? 
VINCE I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit! 
MERLE How much? How much do you wanna bet? 
OTHERS Bet him! Bet him, Vince! 
VINCE I'll betcha! I'll betcha... I'll betcha twenty dollars! 
EXT. V.F.W. POST - PARKED PONTIAC - NIGHT 
SAL and ANGELA emerge to more CHEERS and a shower of streamers and rice. ANGELA is helped into the Pontiac on the right. NICK throws an arm around SAL and walks him around to the driver's seat. 
NICK Don't worry what it says in the book. 
SAL Right. 
NICK Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book. 
SAL I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down. 
NICK Great. That's great. 
SAL That's my plan. 
NICK gives SAL a hug. SAL gets in the car. 
NICK See you Monday. 
SAL See you Monday. 
INT. PONTIAC - NIGHT 
SAL looks over at ANGELA.

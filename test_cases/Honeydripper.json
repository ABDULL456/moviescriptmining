GENERAL STORE - MORNING                              24 LUTHER, the head clerk, arranges boxes on the back wall and shoots a nervous look up front- \nLUTHER I'd have to ask Mr. Skinner. \nTY Of course you would. While you at it, remind him how one of the reasons colored folks come in here is to get the lowdown on what's happening in-- \nLuther brightens as China Doll steps in- \nLUTHER China Doll! \nLuther is clearly smitten- \nCHINA DOLL You gonna let us put these posters up, aint you Luther? \nLUTHER Oh-- I don't think that be any problem at all. \nCHINA DOLL (beaming a smile) That's awful nice of you, Luther. \nLUTHER You lookin special today. \nCHINA DOLL That's sweet of you to say. \nTY Maceo, go on with the man and he show you where you can put em up.

Possum speaks quietly- \nPOSSUM But I know you from way back. \nPossum starts PLAYING, a dark, moody, slide-guitar blues. \nTy looks toward Possum, not happy he's there, then looks away. The MUSIC gets LOUDER, FASTER, Possum MOANING and WHOOPING, stomping his foot- \nWe TIGHTEN on Ty's face, tighter, tighter, then DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK We're in a   BAR ROOM- smoke, heat, packed bodies- Possum's SONG grows   more intense as we TRACK IN on GUITAR MAN- young, with slick   hair a moustache and tons of attitude. He sneers, flicks his   cigarette almost straight at us. \nWe TRACK IN on YOUNG TYRONE, also swearing, stepping away from his piano- \nGuitar Man hands his guitar to one of the eager MEN standing close, hoping for a fight- \nA PRETTY GIRL stands to one side, looking scared and excited, covering her mouth with her hands- \nYoung Tyrone steps in to meet him, the CROWD around almost pushing them together- \nGuitar Man pulls out a KNIFE! Young Tyrone grabs for it and they grapple, face to face, struggling in a terrible dance- \nA TRAIN WHISTLE breaks the spell! \nEXT.

COUNTRY ROAD/2ND COTTON FIELD - DAY                     49 Mourners are walking back down the country road where we saw the coffin carried. \nReverend Cutlip sidles up to Delilah- \nREVEREND CUTLIP A mournful end for a wayward sinner. \nDELILAH She always seemed at peace with herself. \nREVEREND CUTLIP The company she kept, the life she led- \nDELILAH I never knew Bertha Mae to do hurt to a living soul. \nThe Reverend is not too pleased with Delilah's forgiving attitude- \nREVEREND CUTLIP We're all hoping to see you get over and accept the Lord tonight, Delilah. \nDELILAH I'm hoping so too. \nCutlip nods toward the FIELD as they pass the PRISON LABOR GANG, picking cotton under guard- \nREVEREND CUTLIP You been lingering at the threshold long enough, Sister. Time to step ahead. \nDelilah tries not to show how shaken she is by this challenge. She passes out of frame and we see China Doll bringing up the rear of the funeral party, lost in thought. She looks over into the cotton field- \nPOV - SONNY, PRISON LABOR GANG \nSonny bends his back with the other laborers, picking and sweating- \nCHINA DOLL \nChina Doll pauses, frowns as she sees it is Sonny working, a DEPUTY strolling past him, shotgun in hand.

Shack, realizing this must be a setback for Ty, pats his shoulder before he steps onto the train- \nSHACK THOMAS Well, brother- maybe he be in tomorrow. \nWe FOLLOW Ty away from the train as Nat calls `All aboard!' and the engine gathers power. \nPossum sits listening to the single SLIDE NOTES he plays, as if tuning his guitar- \nPOSSUM Somebody didn't show up. \nTY (grim) Wish they'd made you dumb instead of blind. \nWe HOLD on Possum, cackling darkly, as Ty walks away.

Maceo is at the bar- \nTY Well I had my fun if I Don't get well no more Well I had my fun if I Don't get well no more My head is spinnin And I'm goin down slow- \nMACEO Man don't take care of hisself- out drinkin and jazzin the women every night- \nTY Don't make any difference now. \nMACEO Got so bad, I heard there was some ole boy goes around pretendin to be Guitar Sam, fill out the gigs he misses.

Ty takes a drink.   He stares at the keyboard- \nTY There must have been a first one. \nMACEO First what? \nTY Back slavery days, they had the ones that worked in the big house. Might not of had shoes always, but their pants didn't have no holes and they didn't pick no cotton. \nMACEO House niggers. \nTY That's how they called em. They must of had all their African kinda instruments- drums, shakers, some kind of banjo thing- but the piano- \nMACEO Didn't bring no piano over on them ships from Africa. \nTY The piano was just sittin there in the white folks' big room, all polished up-- and I figure this one boy, he goes past fifteen, twenty times a day, running the corner of his eye over it. And he's there when they play, the masters, doin all their minuets and whatever- \nTy PLAYS something like a MINUET- \nTY -him standing there with a tray of white people food pretendin not to have a thought in his head, might be only some dust hangin in the air for all they know- but he's watchin the fingers, see, watchin them keys work. This old boy, the first one, he can play alla them Africa kinda instruments, he can play mud if you give him the key and the tempo, he's got music in his head, in his heart, in every damn piece of him there's music. \nMACEO Down to the bones-- \nTY And one day the masters is away, huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to, and he's alone in the room with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench- \nMACEO Watch out now- \nTY -and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen the minuet player do- and he- \nTy hits a MINOR CHORD, lets it decay- \nTY And he thinks- `Lord help me, I could do some damage with this.' \n", "test2_id": 2767, "test3_input": "SONNY Sorry, folks- must of got kicked on the train. \nThe audience is stone-faced.

He grabs the wires with both hands, yanks- they hold firm! He looks to the stage, panicked- \n-as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp BLASTS the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering, ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO! \nTy stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open- \nSonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone- \nSONNY Gonna hold may baby as tight as I can Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty man!

Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast shuffle on the skins- \nTy looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to pull the wires out. Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off- \nSONNY Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight! \nDelilah smiles and presses her hands together, shooting a look upward- \nDELILAH Thank you, Jesus. \nTime Trenier has his case open now, the gleaming instrument in one hand, squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to the light with the other- \nSONNY Meet me at midnight behind the barn Don't you worry I'll do you no harm \nThe crowd is already CLAPPING and STOMPING in time with the song.

Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving- closer, closer- \nMetalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty, who nods from the piano, so he butts his harp smack against the microphone, takes a deep breath and HONKS his soul out, grabbing the break from Time! \nThe audience goes wild, a half-dozen couples dancing now, others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat where they stand. Sonny shakes out the long CORD attached to his guitar- \nChina Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new CUSTOMERS pressing in the door and dance at the same time, thrilled by the music. Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind her as she turns toward the bandstand- \nMetalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the guitar again, making it WAIL as he hops off the stage, steps up on a chair, then onto the bar counter! \nHe walks the length of the bar, playing his ass off, hops down at the far end, grins at China Doll and heads out through the door, dragging extension cord behind!

Maceo sees as well, tightening up- \nCool Breeze nods to Ty. \nA slow, sexy SAX BREAK comes up and Ty leaves the piano to cross to the bar. When he gets there Maceo is already counting out a huge pile of BILLS- \nMACEO Hundred forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, five, six, seven, eight, nine- hundred fifty. And they's another fifty in here- \nMaceo thunks a heavy CLOTH SACK full of change onto the countertop- \nMACEO Lucky Hardaway don't mind some change, does he? \nCool Breeze doesn't even glance at the money, hard-eying Ty instead- \nCOOL BREEZE What if Mr. Hardaway was to say let the chumps keep their change, he wants the club back one way or the other? \nMaceo looks to Ty, who remains impassive, mind working- \nCOOL BREEZE How'd that be? \nTY Well- he'd have to take it up with my bidness partner. \nTy shifts and we RACK FOCUS to see across the room to Sheriff Pugh, receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from Delilah.

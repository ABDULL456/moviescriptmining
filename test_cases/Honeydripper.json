{"train": "HONEYDRIPPER \nWritten by \nJohn Sayles \nWe hear a strange, single, BENT NOTE. \n1   EXT. SHARECROPPER SHACK - ECU FINGERS - LATE AFTERNOON        1 We follow a small boy's FINGERS on a strange contraption- \nWIDER \nSCRATCH, 10 years old, has a `DIDDLEY BOW', a piece of baling wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is stretched taut. He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret and makes TWANGY, pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire. \nHis friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he has laid on the side of the porch floor. A few scrawny CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them- \nLONNIE Leave off with that, Scratch. \nSCRATCH Aint bothering you. \nLONNIE Yes it is.     That aint no kind of music. \nWe see that the board has PIANO KEYS drawn across it and that Lonnie is pretending to play a song on it- \nSCRATCH Least I make a sound. \nLONNIE Yeah and it's a nasty one. \nLonnie looks at the sky- \nSCRATCH You want to try again tonight? \nLonnie sits on the edge of the porch, gauging the time from the setting sun- \nLONNIE Might as well. \n2   EXT. 1ST COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON                        2 SLIDE GUITAR plays. A tuft of RAW COTTON bobs on the stem and we begin to scroll OPENING CREDITS- \nWe TILT and RACK to look over a FIELD OF COTTON, the bolls plumped out and ready for picking, blowing in the breeze. \nA HARVEST HAND steps into the shot, looks toward the setting sun, wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the row in front of him. We PULL BACK to see other PICKERS, men and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing LONG WHITE SACKS between their legs and behind them. \nThe boys walk down between them in the opposite direction- \n3   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PINEY WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON                3 MUSIC CONTINUES.   We see the boys walking on a PATH through the PINES- \n4   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, RAILROAD TRACKS - AERIAL SHOT - LATE         4 AFTERNOON \nMUSIC CONTINUES. We float over RAILROAD TRACKS cutting through flat, piney woods, catching up the boys, who walk on the ties- \n5   EXT. ARMY BARRACKS - EARLY EVENING                             5 MUSIC CONTINUES. The boys stroll past white buildings of an ARMY BARRACKS. SOLDIERS, black and white, DRILL on the grounds- \n6   EXT. RAILROAD BRIDGE, RIVER - EARLY EVENING                    6 The river rolls past us in the FG as the boys cross a RAILROAD BRIDGE. We SUPERIMPOSE- \nALABAMA   -   1950 \nOPENING CREDITS END \n7   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE - NIGHT                               7 We hear PIANO MUSIC as we CRANE DOWN toward the HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE, a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads. \nBLUE-colored light bulbs (a few broken) FLICK ON and OFF erratically around the HONEYDRIPPER SIGN as we TRACK toward and then THROUGH it on the way to the entrance, catching up with Lonnie and Scratch. \nThe boys step under the door-light, frantic with insects, and go up on their toes to peek in through a window- \n8   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT                                     8 An OVERHEAD ANGLE of long fingers on piano keys- \nSINGER \nA woman in her late 50's, early 60's, BERTHA MAE SPIVEY, leans into a MICROPHONE from where she sits on a stool on a little makeshift stage, a glass of whiskey in hand, and SINGS- \nBERTHA MAE I know a gal name of Betty Sue Shook it so much She got the German flu No matter how she done it No matter how she done it No matter how she done it She done it just the same \nAs she sings we PAN and TRACK, moving through the large, near- empty COUNTRY ROADHOUSE- \nBERTHA MAE You women don't worry About your life She made Jack the Ripper Throw away his knife- \nOnly a few die-hard REGULARS are scattered at the tables and bar stools. A pretty young woman in her late teens, CHINA DOLL, is behind the bar, head held in her hands, listening aimlessly. \nSTOKELY Cause he does all his best work on his knees. \nStokely almost chokes with laughter- \nMACEO Never mind him, he just a drunk- \nSTOKELY I hear she put a ring through it and use it to yank him around the house. \nSlick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm- \nMACEO You know Tyrone don't allow no scufflin here, Slick. \nSTOKELY I oughta get me a old woman too, take care of the groceries. Just got to sweet-talk her some, give her a good poke now and then- \nMACEO You gonna drink, Stokely, or you gonna lay out back recoverin from that busted head you about to get? \nDELILAH Gentlemen- \nThey all turn to see DELILAH, Ty's wife, coming out from the back of the club. She is dressed for church- \nSLICK (doffs his hat)    Miss Delilah- \nDELILAH Let's behave ourselves. (sees) What are you boys doing in here? Out! \nLonnie and Scratch, busted, hurry out.   Delilah turns her attention to China Doll- \nDELILAH And what are you doing behind that bar? \nCHINA DOLL It's just for a minute. \nDELILAH That's sixty seconds too long. Maceo, you get back there and take that child's place. \nChina Doll mopes as she steps out from behind- \nDELILAH You bring people their food. Don't you be messing with their liquor. \nCHINA DOLL Nobody's eating. \nDELILAH That's cause nobody's here but these couple lost souls, haven't had an appetite since they give over to the devil. \nMaceo gets behind the counter as Delilah heads for Ty at the door- \nBERTHA MAE At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where I get my cold can beer At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where I get my cold can beer- \nMaceo reluctantly moves down to take the order of NADINE, a large, handsome woman with a prominent gold tooth who has just stepped in- \nNADINE Evenin, Maceo. You lookin good tonight. \nMACEO Likewise, Miss Nadine.   What can I do for you? \nNADINE (flirting) You know what you can do for me, sweet man. \nMaceo tries to slip the hook and be polite at the same time- \nMACEO What would you like to drink? \nDOORWAY \nTy watches the CROWD in front of the Ace of Spades.   Delilah comes up to join him, indicates his drink- \nDELILAH How many is that tonight? \nTY Don't dog me about that, baby.   Not tonight. \nDELILAH I don't want China Doll behind that bar. \nTY She got to help out. \nDELILAH Not there she doesn't. You know she's not sposed to get excited- \nTY Not much chance of that in here. (wistful) Harvest hands all been crowdin into Toussaint's place. The young ones. \nDELILAH You'll get some of them. \nTY They stick their noses in here, get one little sniff of the music, and they gone. \nDELILAH (joking)   Maybe that's the wages of sin. \nBERTHA MAE You know where to find me if you need me. \nBertha Mae pulls Slick out the door. China Doll watches after them, troubled, while Ty pours himself another drink- \nMACEO (softly)   I put the box on now, Ty? \nTY Yeah.   Put the box on. \nMACEO Imonna crank it up some, see if we can draw a little life in here- \nMaceo crosses and plugs an ancient-looking tabletop JUKEBOX in. \nThe jukebox sputters to life, LIGHTS FLASHING ON and MUSIC BLARING for a moment, then the LIGHTS FLICKER and all the POWER in the club goes OFF! \n9   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT                                     9 The Honeydripper SIGN is the last to FLICKER and DIE. \nLonnie and Scratch watch from under the streetlight- \nLONNIE There it go again. \nSCRATCH Lectricity don't like that jukebox. \n10   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT                                   10 DARKNESS. \nMACEO Damn. \nTY China Doll? \nA MATCH is struck, FLARES as China Doll lights a KEROSENE LAMP she's pulled from under the bar- \nCHINA DOLL Got to get the power company in here- \nTY No you don't. They turned my juice off last month- don't want them sniffin around that splice job Maceo done. \nMACEO Must be a short circuit in the juke here- \nHe yanks the plug out of the wall as Ty steps up to reassure the few patrons- \nTY Don't worry folks, bar's still open. \nNADINE It's nice like this.   Kind of romantic. \nMACEO Imonna have to go out back, wiggle some things around. \nNADINE Don't be wigglin nothin round less I'm there to see it. \nMaceo rolls his eyes as he passes Ty on the way out with a FLASHLIGHT. He freezes in his tracks as the FLASHLIGHT BEAM hits a FIGURE standing in the doorway- \nIt is SHERIFF HIRAM PUGH, large and in charge.    Pugh strolls into the club as if he owns it. \nSHERIFF PUGH Evenin, folks. \nTY Evenin, Sheriff. \nSheriff Pugh looks around the near-empty club- \nSHERIFF PUGH Your lights gone out. \nTY Looks like it. \nSHERIFF PUGH Don't know but that be a vilation of somethin or other. \nTy has played this game before, trying to hold his ground without pissing off the white man with the badge- \nTY We just about to close up here. \nPugh sniffs the air- \nSHERIFF PUGH Your wife been cookin? \nTY Not tonight.   Went to the revival tent. \nSHERIFF PUGH (grins) I stood by there a while. Them nigras was singin up a storm. \nTy doesn't respond. Sheriff Pugh stops right next to Stokely, giving him a dead-pan stare as he speaks. Stokely won't meet his eyes- \nSHERIFF PUGH I just come out here to look in on Toussaint- had that shooting two nights ago. \nSHACK THOMAS (points) Switchman's shed, right over there, has got a cot. Don't mind the rats none, less you got food on you- and I can see you and a good meal has been strangers for some time. \nSonny looks at the shed, unenthusiastic- \nSHACK THOMAS You get into town tomorrow an need somethin, tell em Shack Thomas sent you. They know who you talkin about. \nSONNY Thanks. Hey, what's the name of this town? \nShack points to the SIGN hanging down from the lip of the platform roof- \nSIGN \nHARMONY The sign reads- \nSONNY (O.S.) Name like that, must be a good place for musicians. \nPLATFORM \nShack laughs as he heads away- \nSHACK THOMAS Only night I ever spent in jail was a town called Liberty. Sun comes up, you'll see where you landed. And you best be out of that shed by first light. \n13   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - LATE NIGHT - CU MONEY                    13 A few wet, crumpled BILLS and dirty COINS are spread out on the bartop- \nMACEO (O.S.) It's just a weekday night- \nWIDER \nStill operating by LANTERN LIGHT, Ty and Maceo look at the night's dismal take, as China Doll lays chairs on top of tables- \nTY I owe the chicken man, I owe the ice man, I owe the liquor man- \nMACEO Least you don't owe the electric company. \nTY (indicates the dark room)    Yeah, that's a big relief. \nMACEO (worried)    You thinkin bout closing down? \nTy frowns, reaches under the counter and brings up a POSTER. He spreads it out on the counter top. It reads- \nSPECIAL ATTRACTION \nNew Orleans Singing Sensation \n`GUITAR' SAM \nTY What you think? \nMACEO Biggest act in New Orleans, got him a hit on the radio- \nTY He's playing here Saturday night. Figured I'd wait till Bertha Mae was gone to put this up. \nTy turns to look for the right spot to fix the poster- \nMACEO Here?   You mean like in this room here? \nTY You know the Tomcat Club in Texarkana? \nMACEO Big Jim Jamison's place- \nTY Just went out of business. \nMACEO Damn- \nTY And since Sam is giggin his way over to Tulsa, that means he got the date open- \nMACEO But you aint never had a guitar pl- \nTy gives Maceo a warning look, which China Doll notes- \nTY I'm having one now. \nMACEO What you gonna pay the man with? \nTy glances at China Doll, uneasy- \nTY You just worry about gettin these hung up everywhere in the county tomorrow. Payday come Saturday, he gonna draw alla them cotton pickers and soldiers boys in here, get us back in the black. \nShe gives him a weary look- \nDEX (shakes his head)   You got my sympathies. \n15   EXT. TOWN - TRAIN TRACKS - EARLY MORNING                     15 A WIDE SHOT of the TRACKS that cut the town in two. \nCLOSER \nSonny stands on the tracks just as the SUN RISES, pondering- which side of the tracks is for white people, which for the colored. \nHe hears GUITAR MUSIC to one side, steps cautiously toward it- \n16   EXT. MAIN STREET - GENERAL STORE - EARLY MORNING             16 Sonny wanders down the street lugging his sack and case, moving toward the sound of a SLIDE GUITAR being played expertly- \nAn irate-looking WHITE LADY glares at Sonny as she picks up the milk bottles from her stoop, steps inside and slams the door. Sonny moves ahead, uneasy- \nWe TIGHTEN on his face as he stops to listen, the MUSIC ECHOING, seeming to come from here, then from there, then suddenly from right behind him- \nHe turns- \nPOSSUM, blind, with his chair tilted back against the not-yet- open GENERAL STORE, PLAYS expertly on a beat-up old GUITAR. Sonny lays his case down to listen for a moment, watching the man's fingers- \nPossum gets a whiff of him.     He keeps playing as he speaks- \nPOSSUM Somebody slept in the railroad yard. \nSonny watches the blind man's fingers move on the strings- \nSONNY Yall can play that thing. \nPOSSUM Been doin it near forever. \nSONNY (looking around) Listen, which side of the tracks am I- \nPOSSUM The wrong side for you. \nSONNY What you doing here then? \nPOSSUM White folks look right through me. How much mischief an old blind spook like me gonna get up to anyhow? \nSonny surveys the street- \nSONNY Where our people go for music around here? \nPOSSUM There's a couple places just a little bit out of town. At the crossroads. \nSONNY Long walk? \nPOSSUM You in a hurry? \nPossum finishes his song- \nSONNY How old is that box you playin, Pops? \nPOSSUM (smiles) Second one that ever was- an the devil's got the first. How bout yours? \nPossum gently nudges Sonny's case with his toe.   Sonny is surprised at the blind man's perception- \nSONNY Brand new.     Made it myself. \nPOSSUM (whistles)     Made it hisself- \nSONNY That's right. So these clubs- \nPOSSUM Old Toussaint, owns the Ace of Spades, don't feature live music. And Pinetop Purvis, owns the Honeydripper Lounge? He don't care bout no guitar. Won't have one under his roof. \nSONNY That don't make sense. \nPossum scratches his head- \nPOSSUM Yeah- when a musician put his hand to murder, nine times outa ten it's a drummer done it. But Pinetop a piano man- \nSONNY He killed somebody? \nPOSSUM That's the story.    Might be true, and it might not. \n17   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING - TY                          17 Ty is tacking one of the Guitar Sam POSTERS on the front of the building. \nCHINA DOLL Aint gonna tell me something I haven't heard worse. \nMACEO Well, Nappy goes out and has him a- a porkchop or two, let's say- and he comes back from Toussaint's one night feeling no pain, smelling like- like porkchops- the way a man will- and he falls out on Nadine's couch and commences to snore. Wake up the next mornin, finds she had took all his clothes off without him knowin it- \nTY Man was dog drunk- \nMACEO Miss Nadine come in with a skillet in her hand, hot grits bubbling in it, says \"Baby, I got your breakfast.\" \"Not this morning, Nadine,\" he says, sittin up, \"don't think I could eat a thing.\" \"Well then,\" she says, \"we can't let this go to waste, can we?\" and she dump that whole hot bubblin mess right in the man's lap. \nTY (wincing)    Owwww! \nMACEO Then she got busy with that hot iron on his head. Screams didn't bring the neighbors in, she would of killed that man. \nThey are all quiet for a moment, contemplating- \nTY You got to admit it, though- woman is an artist with that Singer machine. \nSONNY (O.S.) Scuse me? \nThey turn to see Sonny standing in the doorway- \nSONNY Which one of you is Mr. Pinetop? \nTy's eyes fix on Sonny's face for a moment- something familiar there- then go down to the guitar case at his feet- \nTY We aint hirin. \nSONNY I can play anything- \nTy indicates the Guitar Sam POSTER hanging behind the bar- \nTY Already got me a professional. \nSonny looks a little shaky- \nSONNY Guitar Sam really coming all the way out here? \nTY That so surprising? \nSONNY No, no-- uhm, Mr. Shack Thomas said that if I was to- \nTY You know Shack? \nSONNY We uh- we travelled together- \nTy gives him a once-over- \nTY When's the last time you ate solid food, young man? \nSonny has to think- \nTY (to China Doll) Take him back and fix him somethin, China Doll. Standin there all hungry-eyed, puts me off my breakfast. \nSONNY That's real kind of you- \nSonny pulls his hat off as he follows China Doll, who is suddenly quiet and self-conscious, back to the kitchen- \nMACEO Must of come in on the northbound last night. \nTY Look like he got cooties, too. Straw in them boxcars is full of em. \nMACEO Never cared to travel that way. \nTy grows somber, reminiscing- \nTY I was out there ridin them rails between the wars. Seem like half the country headin west rolled past the other half comin back east. (musing) Every one of us scrapin for the next meal- \nCOOL BREEZE (O.S.) This is the place. \nThey turn to see COOL BREEZE, a hard-looking, sharply-dressed character, leading the prosperous looking MR. SIMMONS into the club as if they aren't there- \nCOOL BREEZE Yall can tear things down, put things up- got a lot of potential. \nMR. SIMMONS Looks bigger in here than it does from the outside. \nTY I help you gentlemen? \nCOOL BREEZE Just showing the man gonna run this place what he's got. \nTY Another hundred. \nMACEO We'd have to clear three hundred- \nTY I figure we charge folks two dollars to get in, then drinks- \nMACEO (shakes his head) What I'm sayin is, less he sees the green up front the man won't get off the train. \nA TRUCK HORN honks outside- \nMACEO What's that now? \nTy, mind working, looks desperate as Maceo exits to see who's honking- \n19   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING                                 19 A battered TRUCK sits in front of the club. ZEKE, a taciturn white man, and his black loader step out as Maceo approaches- \nMACEO (calls out) Bout time you fellas run by. We just about dry here. \nThe loader lets down the tailgate to reveal CASES OF BEER AND LIQUOR. He begins to pull them out and pile them on the ground- \nZEKE Your boss in? \nMaceo shouts back into the club- \nMACEO Tyrone!   Whiskey wagon come by! \nTy steps out of the club carrying one of the Guitar Sam posters- \nTY Y'all a day late. \nTy nods at the Ace of Spades club across the way- \nTY Old Man Toussaint gonna chew you out. \nZEKE Toussaint went over to another supplier upstate. We just got you, then we headin down to the army base, officers' club needs servicin. This fifty-six dollars- \nTY (weak grin) My credit no good anymore? \nZeke only has to look at the loader, who starts to put the cases back onto the truck- \nTY Whoah, whoah- what's your hurry? \nZEKE Nobody that's right in his head sell liquor on credit. Specially not to no darktown roadhouse. \nTY Well this is like a special case, see- we got the harvest coming in, soldiers at the base gonna be let out on leave- Saturday night. Aint enough hootch in this truck to satisfy what we gonna sell- \nZEKE You pay as you go.   That's bidness. \nZeke walks toward the cab of the truck, Ty following him, desperate, waving the poster- \nTY You can come by Monday, get paid and take back every damn drop I aint sold! We got Guitar Sam lined up, you know what that means?! \nZeke steps in and slams the door, the loader doing the same on the other side of him- \nTY I'll pay you extra- penny a bottle on the beer and a nickel on the whiskey! \nThe truck engine coughs- \nTY (desperate) What if I throw in five dollars up front, just for you fellas- ? \nZeke pulls away- \nTY Come on, man, everybody give credit, that's the American way! \nBut the truck is gone down the road.   Maceo comes up beside Ty, watching forlornly- \nMACEO Maybe we could buy some busthead from Willie Pettigrew. \nTY With that sheriff sniffin around every night? Land my black ass in jail for good. \nAnother TRUCK pulls around the bend from the opposite direction- \nMACEO Then what we gonna do? \nThe new truck slows to a stop by them.    The DRIVER pokes his head out- \nDRIVER Got a liquor delivery for a Mr. Lucien Toussaint? \nTY You got that boy eatin out of your hand. \nCHINA DOLL Luther's the only one didn't pull my hair when he sit behind me at Sunday school. \nTY Well I hope you got a little that sugar left, cause we got to spread some on Miss Bertha Mae Spivey- \nCHINA DOLL You gone ask her to come sing again? \nTY Imonna ask her for money. Word is she got a whole pile of it squirreled away. \nChina Doll stops, breathing heavily, bends to put her hands on her knees- \nCHINA DOLL Daddy- \nTY Come on, girl, we in a rush here- \nCHINA DOLL I got to rest. \nTy softens, walks back to stand beside her- \nTY I'm sorry, baby.   You catch your breath. \nChina Doll smiles weakly- \nCHINA DOLL So- why Miss Spivey gonna give you money, you don't let her sing at the club any more? \nTY Gonna make her a partner. \nCHINA DOLL Partner in what? \nTY In the Honeydripper. \nCHINA DOLL But all you ever say it's just a hole you pour good money into- \nTY That don't matter.     Imonna make her a proprietor. \nCHINA DOLL `tress'.   Like waiter and waitress. \nTY Proprietress. She got to like the sound of that. \n26   EXT. MAIN STREET - GENERAL STORE - WINDOW, POSTER           26 One of the GUITAR SAM POSTERS appears in the front window as Maceo tapes it up- \nA trio on teenage girls stop to look at it as they pass (Possum is nowhere to be seen)- \nMaceo steps out to join them, eager to close the deal- \nMACEO Lovely ladies out to make a purchase- \nOPAL That the same Guitar Sam is on the radio? \nMACEO The very one. \nOPAL What's he look like? \nMACEO Fine lookin man. Real lady killer from what I hear. Got that New Orleans style to him. \nOPAL You ought to have a picture up there. \nMACEO Oh, we'll be gettin some of those when he comes in on the train. The main thing is, the man is electrified- and you know what that means. \n27   EXT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE                                     27 Formerly a fairly grand house, Bertha Mae's hasn't been painted for awhile and the yard could use some work. Ty coaches China Doll as they climb the stairs- \nTY We make like we just come by to see how she's keepin, and then I'll kind of mention how I been thinking of bringing her on as a partner- \nCHINA DOLL Left the door open. \nChina Doll pushes the front door all the way open. We can hear Bertha Mae's VOICE singing on a scratchy old RECORD. \nChina Doll peeks in to see- \n28   INT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - FRONT PARLOR                         28 -Slick, sitting at the bottom of the STAIRS that lead to the second floor, looking lost and bewildered- \nSLICK She's gone. \nTY Oh. \nTy frowns.    He was all geared up for the siege- \nGatlin spits- \nGATLIN Grab a sack. \n32   EXT. PINEY WOODS - CROSSROADS - AFTERNOON                   32 Maceo nails a Guitar Sam POSTER to a tree, looks over his handiwork. \nAn ARMY PLATOON trudges into the crossroads, sweat-soaked and footsore- \nMaceo watches, pleased, as the black soldiers check the poster out as they pass- \nMACEO Saturday night, fellas! Every fine- looking colored woman in the county gonna be there- don't want to miss it! \nA white LIEUTENANT passes, giving Maceo a dark look.   Maceo salutes- \nMACEO Afternoon, sir.   Nice lookin bunch of soldiers. \n33   INT. MAYOR WINFIELD'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY             33 Delilah sits at the dining room table with a sandwich she's made herself. We hear PERRY COMO on a RECORD somewhere in the house. She hasn't gotten two bites down before Amanda wanders in, crossing to the liquor cabinet- \nAMANDA Oh dear, I believe it's about that time- \nShe pulls out a DECANTER OF WINE- \nAMANDA Would you care to join me? \nDELILAH No thank you. \nAmanda pours herself a glass of wine- \nAMANDA Of course you won't join me, you don't partake. That was thoughtless of me. \nDELILAH That's all right. \nAMANDA So you don't take spirits and- what else? In your church? \nDELILAH I'm sort of between churches right now. I been thinking about changing over to the Holiness, but I- I haven't been sanctified yet. \nAMANDA Ah- \nDELILAH There's been a minister in this week- \nAMANDA The tent out by the fairgrounds. \nDelilah nods.   Amanda takes a drink- \nAMANDA The church I grew up in- we were Pentacostals- they wouldn't have anything but the human voice inside the church. And dancing- any kind of dancing, music, card playing-- well, it was very strict. They took up serpents. \nDELILAH I've heard of that. \nAMANDA I tell Floyd these stories and he's horrified. They've always been Methodists, Floyd's family. \nDELILAH They're good people too. \nAMANDA When I married Floyd-- oh, it was quite a scandal among my relatives. As if I'd taken up with somebody in a cult. \nDELILAH It can be a trial, married folks differ in their religion. \nAMANDA And your husband is a--- ? \nDELILAH Unaffiliated. \nAMANDA Unaffiliated. I see.    He has his-- social club- \nDELILAH The Honeydripper. \nAMANDA Such a colorful name. \nDELILAH Yes. \nAMANDA He must devote a great deal of his energy to it. \nDELILAH It's just him and Maceo Green runs it, and then I go over and cook some when I get off here. \nAMANDA That's very- supportive of you. Considering the sort of- environment- \nDELILAH (defensive) I been in those barrooms most of my life, Miss Amanda. \nAmanda realizes she has probed too deep, tries to back up- \nSonny is way behind the others, not dressed for the work, wincing as he pricks his fingers for the umpteenth time. NED, a little prisoner picking his way back in the opposite direction in a parallel row, takes pity on him- \nNED Y'all never done this job before. \nSONNY Can't say I have. \nNED You want to set your pins out wide, bend over from the hip- \nSonny widens his stance- \nNED -and don't be bobbin up and down all the time. When you up, be up, but when you on the row, stay down. \nSonny digs in and keeps low- \nNED But most important, you got to get you a rhythm. Everything in this life got a rhythm to it- even pullin cotton off the plant. \nSONNY Lay it out for me. \nNED Not my rhythm- your rhythm. That's between you and the day and the work you got before you. Once you on it, don't let nothin and nobody push you off it. \nSONNY I'm going so slow. \nNED You gettin paid by the pound or by the hour? \nSONNY I'm not gettin paid at all.   None of us are. \nNed cackles- \nNED Then I suggest you work that into your rhythm too. \nA DEPUTY calls out- \nDEPUTY Let's see more pickin and less talkin over there! \nNED Gettin right on it, Boss! \nNed picks his way behind Sonny. Sonny starts to rock slightly, looking for a rhythm of movement he can maintain- \n36   EXT. 1ST OPPOSITE COTTON FIELD                            36 The free pickers sit on and around the truck that brought them, eating lunch. Dex watches the prison laborers across the road as he SHUFFLES a battered DECK OF CARDS, sitting with a couple of the other men- \nDEX Them boys fryin over there. \nJUNEBUG That Judge Gatlin's gang- he work them people from can until can't, ever damn day, and when his fields is picked he bid em out to the neighbors. Harvest time comes round here, you sign up with somebody fast or you stay outa sight. \nDex waves flies away from his face, spits- \nDEX Ate a peck of dust today. \nJUNEBUG Take some water. \nDEX Only thing wash the dust out is whiskey. \nJUNEBUG (smiles) Aint enough whiskey in this world wash out what I swallowed in my life. \nDex riffles the cards- \nJUNEBUG What we playin for? \nDEX Two bits a hand. \nJUNEBUG That's kind of steep- \nDex laughs and starts to deal a card at a time to the players- \nDEX Hell, I member playin this game one night- Memphis is Boss Crump's town, folks is gamblin before they can walk- ten dollars a hand. I caught a winnin streak that cleaned out half the sportin men on Beale Street. Got up from that table, my money was as long as train smoke- \nJUNEBUG What happen to it? \nDex raises his voice so the woman he checked out in the morning can hear- \nDEX Spent it all on fine-lookin women. \nHe calls to where Ham stands in knee-high grass, a heavy stick in his hand, staring intently at the ground- \nDEX Yo, Missippi- \nJUNEBUG His name Hamilton. \nPOSSUM Oh, nothin much. \nTy steps away.    Possum speaks quietly- \nPOSSUM But I know you from way back. \nPossum starts PLAYING, a dark, moody, slide-guitar blues. \nTy looks toward Possum, not happy he's there, then looks away. The MUSIC gets LOUDER, FASTER, Possum MOANING and WHOOPING, stomping his foot- \nWe TIGHTEN on Ty's face, tighter, tighter, then DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK We're in a   BAR ROOM- smoke, heat, packed bodies- Possum's SONG grows   more intense as we TRACK IN on GUITAR MAN- young, with slick   hair a moustache and tons of attitude. He sneers, flicks his   cigarette almost straight at us. \nWe TRACK IN on YOUNG TYRONE, also swearing, stepping away from his piano- \nGuitar Man hands his guitar to one of the eager MEN standing close, hoping for a fight- \nA PRETTY GIRL stands to one side, looking scared and excited, covering her mouth with her hands- \nYoung Tyrone steps in to meet him, the CROWD around almost pushing them together- \nGuitar Man pulls out a KNIFE! Young Tyrone grabs for it and they grapple, face to face, struggling in a terrible dance- \nA TRAIN WHISTLE breaks the spell! \nEXT. TRAIN YARD - MORNING - PRESENT Possum stops playing and cocks his head to listen- \nThe WHISTLE again as the TRAIN APPROACHES. \nTy takes a deep breath, hoping- \n49   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/2ND COTTON FIELD - DAY                     49 Mourners are walking back down the country road where we saw the coffin carried. \nReverend Cutlip sidles up to Delilah- \nREVEREND CUTLIP A mournful end for a wayward sinner. \nDELILAH She always seemed at peace with herself. \nREVEREND CUTLIP The company she kept, the life she led- \nDELILAH I never knew Bertha Mae to do hurt to a living soul. \nThe Reverend is not too pleased with Delilah's forgiving attitude- \nREVEREND CUTLIP We're all hoping to see you get over and accept the Lord tonight, Delilah. \nDELILAH I'm hoping so too. \nCutlip nods toward the FIELD as they pass the PRISON LABOR GANG, picking cotton under guard- \nREVEREND CUTLIP You been lingering at the threshold long enough, Sister. Time to step ahead. \nDelilah tries not to show how shaken she is by this challenge. She passes out of frame and we see China Doll bringing up the rear of the funeral party, lost in thought. She looks over into the cotton field- \nPOV - SONNY, PRISON LABOR GANG \nSonny bends his back with the other laborers, picking and sweating- \nCHINA DOLL \nChina Doll pauses, frowns as she sees it is Sonny working, a DEPUTY strolling past him, shotgun in hand. Sonny sees her, lowers his head in shame- \n50   EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATE MORNING                               50 The TRAIN has just pulled into the station.       A pair of PULLMAN PORTERS step out-- \nBut nobody else. \nTy feels his heart sink. Shack Thomas comes up behind him, carrying an overnight bag- \nSHACK THOMAS Tyrone- got somebody gettin off here? \nTY Supposed to be. \nHe halts by Ty for a moment, watching.      Nobody else is stepping out- \nSHACK THOMAS What's the party's name? \nSHERIFF PUGH You think you too smart for the rest of us, don't you, Tyrone? Think you can go it by yourself. \nHe puts his feet down and sits forward, drilling Ty with his eyes- \nSHERIFF PUGH You'd rather eat roofin nails than come to me for a favor- \nTY It's not a favor if I got to pay- \nSHERIFF PUGH Oh, you gonna pay all right. You don't hand me that money Sunday mornin, you got yourself a new partner. Same deal as I got with Toussaint. How'd that be? \nTy considers.

SEWING ROOM - NADINE                                    54 MUSIC plays on the RADIO as Nadine masterfully works her SEWING MACHINE and Maceo stands by uneasily. He holds up the denim jacket Sonny left at the club- \nMACEO This size, right, but it's got to shine. \nNADINE And when you need this? \nMACEO Tonight. \nNADINE (considers) That's a tall order. \nMACEO It's got to happen. \nNADINE (fishing) You know, I do my best work, my fastest work, when I'm happy. \nCHINA DOLL I had the rheumatic fever when I was little, left me with a weak heart. \nSONNY Oh.

PARLOR                                               56 TIME TRENIER, an older musician with a permanently stoic expression, sits watching his pupil, a YOUNG BOY, torture the SCALES with a CORNET. He glances up at Ty and Maceo, trying not to plug their ears as the boy continues to PLAY- \nMACEO Mr. Time Trenier- that's a name to be reckoned with. \nTime doesn't seem to react to the flattery- \nMACEO Story goes that you used to play with Buddy Bolden. \nTIME Played with most all of em down there. \nMACEO And King Oliver- \nTIME One band falls apart you find yourself another one. Never any shortage of bands, down New Awlins. \nTY I didn't know you was givin lessons. \nTIME Pays the rent.

COUNTRY ROAD, 2ND COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON        57 The free pickers are lined up at the side of the road- \nSONNY How'd you get your start? \nTy sighs, sits back from his work- \nTY Down in Mobile there was an old cathouse professor name of Joe Dudlow, had had a stroke on one side, curled him all up- but he kept on pluggin. I used to come out and play his left hand for him. \nSONNY How old you were? \nTY (shrugs) Thirteen, fourteen. This one night it was goin hot and heavy and Joe just passed, right there at the piano, in the middle of Black Bottom Stomp. They propped him up at the bar, stuck a drink in his hand, and told me to keep poundin them ivories. (shakes his head) There was a meanness hanging over them juke joints, there was murder in the air. You stopped playin for a minute, it come down like a flock of crows. \nSonny stops by a poster for the `REGINALD ERSKINE BAND featuring Tyrone \"Pinetop\" Purvis'- \nSONNY This is you- \nTY Big band days, on the road. If a railroad train run through it, we played it. \nSONNY (reading) `Reginald Erskine'. Don't believe I ever heard of him- \nTY Big tall light-skin fella out of Carolina, said he's part Cherokee. Couldn't play nothin, but he waved his little stick and had this long greasy hair he throw around like Cab Calloway. \nSONNY And you were the piano man. \nTY Piano man, arranger, you name it. \nSONNY That must of been somethin, see the country first class. \nTY I don't know about first class, but we seen the country. \nSONNY How come you stopped? \nTY (shrugs) Got tired of carrying another man's water. Didn't want to die in no colored hotel some night in Who-Knows-Where Arkansas. \nHe bangs the last nail in- \nTY Met Delilah and wanted something of my own. \nSONNY Well you don't have nothing to worry about, Mr. Pinetop. I won't let you down tonight. \nTy looks at Sonny, considers telling him what the plan is- \nTY No-   I don't spose you will. \nTy gets up and goes into the back. \nSonny crosses to the tangle of wires coming out of the wall behind the counter and snaking off in every direction. He grabs hold of one, thinking- \n59   INT. PURVIS HOUSE - KITCHEN                                  59 Delilah is in her kitchen, HUMMING a GOSPEL SONG to herself, apron on as she begins to make a pie. She pulls a METAL FLOUR CANNISTER down from the shelf, flips the lid off- about half full. \nShe starts to scoop flour out from it and something falls out- a small CLOTH PURSE. She picks it up to put it aside, then frowns at the way it feels. She shakes flour off, unzips it- \nNothing inside. \n60   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BACK ROOM                             60 Maceo loads bottles of beer into the ICEBOX, wincing as the sounds of a SCREAMING ARGUMENT blast in from the bar- \nDELILAH (O.S.) How could you do that? \nTY (O.S.) Imonna put that back and double- \nDELILAH (O.S.) You don't go gamblin with my baby's money! \nTY (O.S.) I had to send off the advance pay or the man don't come and play- \nDELILAH (O.S.) I don't care what you took it for, I saved that money up for China Doll- \nDelilah bursts through the swinging door into the back room, pursued by Ty, trying to explain- \nDELILAH -and you got no business puttin your fingers on it! \nTY China Doll don't need any school, baby, she could walk into one of them shops right this minute and get a job! \nDELILAH There's got to be some line you won't cross, some thing you won't do- \nTY The world starts throwin me breaks, woman, maybe I'll catch religion and walk the straight and narrow like them Bible thumpers you sit up with, but till that day, I- \nDELILAH Reverend Cutlip is right about you! \nWHAM! Delilah slams the back door as she storms out. Ty turns and CRACK! kicks an empty crate halfway across the floor before stomping out to the bar. Maceo opens a beer with the church-key hanging from the icebox handle, takes a gulp and sits to ponder this new development- \nREVEREND CUTLIP Is there anyone out here tonight gonna answer His call? Is there anyone out here tonight gonna come forward and be saved? \nDELILAH \nDelilah is standing, tears running down her cheeks, filled with the emotion of the moment- \nREVEREND CUTLIP The fire is heatin up, Brothers and Sisters, and Judgement Day is nigh! Aint no time to hesitate, you got to come on down and take Him into your heart! \nDelilah starts to walk down the aisle- \nREVEREND CUTLIP That's right- come on down! They no turning back now- feel the Lord's hand at your back- got to leave all them sinners behind! \nDelilah stops in the middle of the aisle, trembling, unsure- \nREVEREND CUTLIP (sees her) You got a voice in your heart, Sister- that's the Lord talking! You hear him? \nDelilah starts to nod her head, weeping- \nREVEREND CUTLIP That voice telling you where you need to be right now! You just got to move your feet and get there! \n70   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BACK ROOM - NIGHT                        70 China Doll fusses with Sonny's hair after he hangs his guitar, dangling with electrical hookups, over his head- \nCHINA DOLL You look good. \nTy steps back in with them, wiping sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. He looks Sonny over- his hair slick and shiny, the outfit Nadine sewed up for him tight and sparkling- \nTY (impressed) Damn- \nCHINA DOLL He looks good, doesn't he Daddy? \nTY Honey, I want you to get right by that front door and take over collectin the cover charge. And if anything should happen- like go wrong or something- you just step out and walk away from the club, hear? \nCHINA DOLL What's gonna go wrong? \nTY Oh- our Guitar Sam here gets them soldier boys jumping it could get a little rough- just be on your toes, that's all. \nCHINA DOLL Okay. \nShe starts away- \nTY China Doll- \nCHINA DOLL Yeah? \nTY You know there aint a thing in this world I wouldn't do for you. Even if I mess up sometimes, you know that, right? \nChina Doll looks at him, not sure what brought this on, but pleased to hear it. The CALLS for Guitar Sam grow LOUDER from the floor- \nCHINA DOLL I know that, Daddy. \nTY You go on, now. \nChina Doll exits and Ty looks back to Sonny- \nTY Well, you look like something might of come outa New Orleans- \nSONNY I forget to tell you- I fixed your hook-up. \nTY My what? \nSONNY Where the electricity comes in?    It was all- \nMACEO (O.S.) Ty! \nThey turn to see Maceo stepping in, concerned- \nMACEO We got a situation out there- \nTY You don't think I know that? \nMACEO Got the law in the house. \n71   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BARROOM                              71 Sheriff Pugh stands near the piano, putting a considerable damper on the mood in the room.

See them army uniforms- \nSONNY Sorry, folks- must of got kicked on the train. \nThe audience is stone-faced.   Could this really be the man? \nYoung Henry steps up and sits behind the DRUM KIT, pulling sticks from inside his shirt- \nTy closes his eyes, begins to shake his head in defeat- \nChina Doll looks worried, collecting another cover charge at the door- \nDelilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage, worried- \nSonny holds his arms out wide, shifting his body to get the BUZZ under control- \nDex leans to talk in Junebug's ear- \nDEX What's this fool playin at? \nMaceo isn't going to wait to find out. He grabs the wires with both hands, yanks- they hold firm! He looks to the stage, panicked- \n-as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp BLASTS the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering, ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO! \nTy stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open- \nSonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone- \nSONNY Gonna hold may baby as tight as I can Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty man! Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight! \nSonny looks over to Ty, who catches himself and begins to play along. Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast shuffle on the skins- \nTy looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to pull the wires out. Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off- \nSONNY Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight! \nDelilah smiles and presses her hands together, shooting a look upward- \nDELILAH Thank you, Jesus. \nTime Trenier has his case open now, the gleaming instrument in one hand, squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to the light with the other- \nSONNY Meet me at midnight behind the barn Don't you worry I'll do you no harm \nThe crowd is already CLAPPING and STOMPING in time with the song. Henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to keep time- \nSONNY Make sure to bring my rockin shoes Tonight I'm gonna rock away all of my blues! \nTime Trenier screws the mouthpiece on, puts his horn to his lips and BLOWS right on the beat to take the sax break, walking through the parting crowd to the bandstand! \nJunebug grabs Opal's hand and they begin to DANCE a modified jitterbug, people spreading to give them room- \nSheriff Pugh, hands still over his ears, sits in a corner paying special attention to Opal's hip action- \nAs Time continues to blow, stepping up onto the stage, Sonny keeps urging Metalmouth Sims to come closer to his microphone with the harmonica. Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving- closer, closer- \nMetalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty, who nods from the piano, so he butts his harp smack against the microphone, takes a deep breath and HONKS his soul out, grabbing the break from Time! \nThe audience goes wild, a half-dozen couples dancing now, others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat where they stand. Sonny shakes out the long CORD attached to his guitar- \nChina Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new CUSTOMERS pressing in the door and dance at the same time, thrilled by the music. Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind her as she turns toward the bandstand- \nMetalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the guitar again, making it WAIL as he hops off the stage, steps up on a chair, then onto the bar counter! \nHe walks the length of the bar, playing his ass off, hops down at the far end, grins at China Doll and heads out through the door, dragging extension cord behind! Lonnie and Scratch hurry to pull slack for him as he steps out into the NIGHT- \n72   EXT.

We HOLD on the doorway as OLD MAN TOUSSAINT comes out to look, puzzled and angry- \nHe steps away just as the song ends to APPLAUSE, Ty taking a deep sigh of relief. Sonny steps up to the microphone to introduce the next song- \nTOUSSAINT (O.S.) You is a lie! \nA shocked silence. \nThe audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come tottering up to the foot of the stage. He points a bony finger at Sonny- \nTOUSSAINT You is a lie, boy! I known Sammy since he's drinkin mama's milk, hell, I known his Mama herself when she live up to Plaquemine- and you aint him! \nThe audience looks to Sonny for his defense- \nTy holds his breath.   Maceo brings the baseball bat up from behind the bar. \nSonny just smiles- \nSONNY That's Creole Guitar Sam you talkin bout, Pops. I'm Delta Guitar Sam. \nToussaint ponders this a moment, then huffs- \nTOUSSAINT As long as we straight on that. \nJUNEBUG Get on outa there and let the man play! \nA CHORUS of CRIES to the same effect, and Sonny crosses back to his microphone- \nSONNY Imonna play you one I come up with today while I was havin my hair cut- \nHe starts into a bouncy INTRO that Metalmouth joins in with, then starts to SING as the crowd starts to dance and clap- \nSONNY Oh China Doll Can't get you offa my mind!

GENERAL STORE - MORNING                              24 LUTHER, the head clerk, arranges boxes on the back wall and shoots a nervous look up front- \nLUTHER I'd have to ask Mr. Skinner. \nTY Of course you would. While you at it, remind him how one of the reasons colored folks come in here is to get the lowdown on what's happening in-- \nLuther brightens as China Doll steps in- \nLUTHER China Doll! \nLuther is clearly smitten- \nCHINA DOLL You gonna let us put these posters up, aint you Luther? \nLUTHER Oh-- I don't think that be any problem at all. \nCHINA DOLL (beaming a smile) That's awful nice of you, Luther. \nLUTHER You lookin special today. \nCHINA DOLL That's sweet of you to say. \nTY Maceo, go on with the man and he show you where you can put em up.

RAILROAD TRACKS/RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING      25 Ty and China Doll hurry down the tracks and cross to the black side of town- \n", "test2_input": "DELILAH You work so hard at the Lounge, and what it brings in- \nTY Isn't even as much as what you make polishin that white lady's silver. I know. \nDELILAH I didn't say that. \nTY You didn't have to. \nDelilah gives up, knowing he's set on his mood- \nDELILAH It'll just have to work out, then. \nA strained silence.   Delilah crosses to the back door- \nDELILAH Meetin gonna start without I'm there. \nTY Your soul not the one needs savin, baby. \nShe gives Ty a lost look, steps out.   The screen door slams. China Doll sees how worried Ty is- \nCHINA DOLL It's all gonna be fine, Daddy. Everbody in town talkin bout Guitar Sam comin to Harmony. \n39   EXT. REVIVAL TENT - NIGHT - WIDE SHOT                      39 A CHOIR sings at the front of the LANTERN-LIT tent, a CONGREGATION of salvation-seekers filling the benches- \nCHOIR Mother died- Yes she died and left me It was long- long time ago Oh but I searched Searched her record over I found mother just had to go \nUNDER TENT \nCHOIR Oh she cried son, Son don't you worry Oh you know the Lord Always fix a way \nDelilah arrives at the rear of the tent, finds herself a spot on a bench- \nCHOIR She left me standing Standing along the highway Oh wondering- which way I must go! \nREVEREND CUTLIP watches his singers, clapping out time with his big hands- \nCHOIR As I walked- All along the highway I was seeking my Lord each day She left me standing Standing along the highway Just wondering- which way must I go! \n`Amens' and other sounds greet the end of the song. Reverend Cutlip steps to the center of the platform and looks around at the souls gathered- \nREVEREND CUTLIP The Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, will twist you and turn you, it will run you this way and that way, it will tempt you with many a detour-- for the Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, is designed to lead us astray! \nHe gets an `Amen!' from someone in the crowd- \nREVEREND CUTLIP It meanders away from the Light and into the Darkness, it tires our legs and whittles away at our spirits! \nThe congregation start to get into it, RESPONDING, rocking with the rhythm of the sermon, flapping their PAPER FANS that advertise Beauchamp's Funeral Home in the hot night-- \nREVEREND CUTLIP It snares us with the thorns and thistles of wickedness, it is paved with the black deeds of sinners and laid out on a crooked plan! That's not the road we want to be on, Brothers and Sisters, that's not the path we need to follow! \nThe Reverend picks up speed- \nREVEREND CUTLIP We got to get on that other road! The one that leads to salvation! The one that leads to glory! The one that leads to the right hand of God! Praise His name! \nCONGREGATION Praise the Lord! \nREVEREND CUTLIP The thoroughfare I'm talking about, the righteous path we got to tread, is called the Highway to Heaven, and by the great Lord above it is straight and it is narrow! (MORE) REVEREND CUTLIP(cont'd) Keep your eyes on the prize and your feet on the street and you won't ever make a mis-step, you won't ever falter, you won't ever stumble, because Jesus will show you the Way! \nSeveral people in the audience are up and SHOUTING now, getting into the Spirit. Reverend Cutlip shifts gear, filling his voice with a sense of dread and warning- \nREVEREND CUTLIP But you got to pay attention to who it is walking beside you, Brothers and Sisters, got to be wary against those who will hold you back from your journey! There's many a loved one got to be left behind! Cause you either on the road or you lost in the wilderness! \nDELILAH \nWe TIGHTEN on Delilah as she listens, upset, taking this all very personally- \nREVEREND CUTLIP (O.S.) You either headed for glory or doomed to damnation! You either in with the Lord or you in with the Devil- and they aint no in-between! \n40   INT.

Breakfast was a joke, lunch was a rumor- \nNED -and dinner was a anecdote. \nKING (laughs) Spose you been locked in that box. \nNED Or one just like it. \nSonny begins to SING softly, almost to himself- \nSONNY Well you wake up in the morning Hear the bing-bong ring- Walk up to the table And see the same damn thing All Imonna tell you Knife, a fork and a pan If you say a thing about it You're in trouble with the Man \nThe men join him on the chorus- \nALL Let the Midnight Special Shine its light on me Oh let the Midnight Special Shine its ever-lovin light on me- \nSonny turns to face them- \nNED You a singer, young man? \nSONNY Singer, guitar player- Imonna be on the radio some day. People gonna know my name. \nNED (chuckles) Keep thinkin that way, young man. Judge Gatlin don't choose to work you into your grave, you just might do it. \nSonny ponders this, looking back out through the bars, singing more moodily now as we TRACK AWAY from the cell- \nSONNY If you ever go to Houston Don't you stagger don't you fight Cause the Sheriff will arrest you You're in the cooler for the night- \nFADE TO BLACK. \n41   INT.

Delilah notices, frowns. Reverend Cutlip takes note as well- \nA shovel digs into piled dirt- \nDirt is tossed down upon us and the screen goes BLACK. \n46   EXT. RAILROAD STATION - MORNING                              46 Ty waits for a train, still in his mourning suit. We TIGHTEN on his face- tense, preoccupied with his schemes to save the club- \nPOSSUM Hear tell Miss Bertha Mae passed. \nTy whirls around-- somehow he didn't see Possum, sitting on a bench behind him, guitar in his lap. \nTY That's right. \nPOSSUM She lived it how she sang it. \nTy tries to ignore him, looks down the rails- \nPOSSUM Waitin for somebody. \nTy is silent. \nPOSSUM Aint nobody on that train gonna change your luck, Tyrone. Gonna have to save your own self. \nTY (annoyed)    What you know about anything? \n", "test3_input": "A silence.    Maceo is moved by the scene- \nMACEO Would have liked to been there. I mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it. \nTy gets up and crosses the room with his drink in his hand, distraught. This is the end for Ty, no strategies left, nothing but the bitter taste of total defeat- \nTY Mace, Imonna lose my club. \nMACEO Old Man Toussaint finds out you stole his liquor, you like to lose more than that- \nTY I got no more cards to play- \nMACEO Maybe if you was to go down, see Lucky Hardaway in person- \nTY (angry) I aint kissin up to no cokey-nose, conk-headed- \nWHAP! He kicks Sonny's guitar case, left sticking out under a table, and sends it spinning across the floor till it CRASHES into the bar and flips open. Ty and Maceo stare at the contents- \nTY What the hell that sposed to be? \nMaceo pulls out a home-built SOLID BODY GUITAR, a painted white rectangle with a complicated PICKUP jury-rigged over the strings and yards of ELECTRICAL CORD hanging off it- \nMACEO Some kind of guitar. \nTY A guitar has got a hole in it, that's where the sound comes from. That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs. \nChina Doll rushes in, upset- \nCHINA DOLL They gone and arrest him! \nTY Arrested who? \nCHINA DOLL Sonny. The high Sheriff arrested him and sold him over to Judge Gatlin. \nTY Who's Sonny? \nCHINA DOLL Sonny that was here yesterday morning. \nTY Sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him. Maceo, make a noise on that- \nMaceo plucks a string.    Not much of a sound- \nMACEO It's electric- \nTY I plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall I get more music out of it than that mess gonna make. \nMACEO Naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see? You got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out- \nHe dumps the sack Sonny brought out and outs falls a mass of tubes and wires, also home-modified- \nMACEO -your amplifier. Which is what this thing must be. \nCHINA DOLL Sonny said he fix radios in the Army. \nTY Sonny didn't do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybody's Army, and some of em crawled in his head. Surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton. Judge Gatlin bought himself a droolin idiot. What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway? \nCHINA DOLL Daddy- \nTY Less you gonna sit over on your chair and play them little Charley Christian kind of riffs- \nMACEO A sideman- \nTY Sit over there and be all clean and polite. Guitar hasn't been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters, sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies- \nMACEO Old time music- \nCHINA DOLL Daddy, Sonny didn't do nothin to be arrested for! He was just lookin for work. \nMACEO They hung colored boys for less than that, darlin. Least on the work gang they feed em, keep their strength up. \nCHINA DOLL But he doesn't belong there! \nMaceo turns the guitar over in his hands- \nMACEO You know, Guitar Sam plays him an electric, but I don't think it's this no-hole kind of deal. \nTY I hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night, lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass! \n", "test3_true": "TY (thinking out loud) Now if he did show up here-- and our power was to go out again while he was playing- \nMACEO (O.S.) I think I fixed it good this time, Ty. \nTy smiles- \nTY So he come out and plugs his ax in- \nMACEO He come out lookin good, from what I hear. All kind of spangly pants and jacket, got his name spelled out on the back- \nTY Clothes, right- \nMACEO Hair all slick and shiny, flash some gold teeth at them gals, got his sax man behind him, maybe a piano, harmonica, drums- \nTY You remember that night the lights went out in the Esquire Club in Mobile? \nMACEO (smiles) And somebody took off with the gate? Stole the whole damn register off the counter- \nTY They didn't hold it against Reggie Porter, did they? \nMACEO Naw- it was his place that got robbed. \nTY Didn't hold it against him, didn't expect no money back for the show- \nMACEO They all too busy diving on the pot of that tonk game got interrupted- \nTY And nobody suspected it might be Reggie Porter hisself that pulled them lights, did they? \nMaceo begins to see where Ty is leading- \nMACEO Aw, no, Ty, we can't- \nTy claps his hands together, jumps up and heads for the door- \nTY China Doll, you mind the place while we're gone! (to Maceo) Come on, man, we got work to do. \nCHINA DOLL Where you going, Daddy? \nTY I promise the people Guitar Sam, they gonna get Guitar Sam! \n52   INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE                                     52 We start on a portrait of Governor Big Jim Folsom on the wall, then TILT DOWN to Sheriff Pugh, feet up on the desk, a table-top FAN pointed at him, looking up at Ty- \nSHERIFF PUGH Why you interested in this boy? \nTY Got a job for him. \nSHERIFF PUGH Must be doin pretty good for yourself out there, Tyrone, you hirin new people on. \nTY Passing well, yeah- \nSHERIFF PUGH But this boy- \nTY Name is Sonny- \nSHERIFF PUGH He's payin off his debt to society right now, and if I was to pull him out of the field it would cost the county- \nTY Judge Gatlin payin three a day for prison labor. \nSHERIFF PUGH You gonna pay me four for the duration of his sentence? \nTY Which might be- ? \nSHERIFF PUGH -as long as I care to make it. \nTY Well, I was counting on more of a one-time deal- if I could just rent him out for the weekend- \nSHERIFF PUGH Fifty dollars. \nTy looks stricken- \nSHERIFF PUGH It's not just the money. There's legalistic principles involved here. Public safety issues- \nTY I pay you Sunday morning? \nSHERIFF PUGH You pay me now or you forget about it. \nTY I don't have it now. \n"}

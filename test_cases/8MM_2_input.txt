ON THE SCREEN: the FACES of TEENAGERS, boys and girls, one after the other, MISSING... MISSING... MISSING... 
INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles searches the SHELVES of the LIBRARY.  He begins taking down various books... 
"Motion Picture Photography."  "Film Stocks and Physical Characteristics."  "Super 8 Filmmaking." 
INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- LATER -- MONTAGE 
In Welles' notepad: "SUPRAlux 544." Welles sits paging through technical photography books. 
INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded through the projector.  He turns the CLATTERING projector on and sits, watching. 
ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, then... the skinny GIRL in a negligee, sitting on the bed.  The CAMERA'S SPOTLIGHT casts long shadows.  The girl stares, oblivious... 
ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a bathroom, and the MASKED MAN enters, wearing the ghastly WRESTLING MASK.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems to be saying something.  The FILM halts. 
Welles sits forward, hand on the projector.  He's seen something.  He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE... 
ON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting... 
Welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the image.  He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME... 
FRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves forward... door closing behind him... STOP... 
FREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom mirror.  Grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one brief instant just before the bathroom door closes. 
Welles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost ethereal image of the Third Man. 
EXT.  CLEVELAND STREET CORNER -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles is in a PHONE BOOTH, feeds many quarters into the phone, waiting, looking at his notepad. 
WELLES (into PHONE) Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles. Here's where we stand.  I checked the film stock and it's called Supra- lux 544.  The company that made that stock discontinued it in '92... (listens) Yeah, about five or six years ago. Anyway, do what you can to dig up your husband's old financial records, look for anything out of the ordinary... 
INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles is back at the computer, alone, drinking coffee. ON THE COMPUTER: endless PHOTOS of MISSING CHILDREN. The PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER: 
WELLES (V.O., cont) Nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore, so we can assume there are reasons our guys did.  First, they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise. Obviously, this isn't the kind of movie you can just drop off at the one-hour photo... 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles just stands, staring at the PHOTO of the GIRL. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) Second, the film that went through the camera is what we've got. There's no negative.  Unlike video, it wasn't meant to be duplicated. No reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around... 
INT.  CLEVELAND BAR -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Local bar.  Welles sits drinking with the archive's director, talking, smiling at something the director said. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) There don't seen to be many fingerprints on the film itself, but I'm going to have to be careful to leave them intact... 
INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles is tired, unshaven.  He's moved on to the physical files, at one table, looking through HUNDREDS of MISSING PERSON BULLETINS.  Secretaries tend to other files. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) It's okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film, but you'll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police. That way I don't have to explain why my prints are on it... 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) There were three men.  Two are obvious; the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but I caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror.  It's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching... 
ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses his lips to hers.  Masked Man backs away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out... 
Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) So, there were three.  They would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to.  That's all for now... except, I feel I should tell you... with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago... 
Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall.  It shows the Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) Well, it's not very likely we'll ever find out who this girl was. (listens) I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye. 
V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP. 
ON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on the arch between his index finger and thumb.  Grainy and hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO. 
INT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE 
Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger, projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard. 
He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING... the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand. 
INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY 
Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven, drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one... 
Welles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive's director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving. Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
TITLE CARD:      three weeks later 
EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY 
In the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking.  He tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat. 
INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY 
Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled "North Carolina 1992," flipping through picture cards.  The FACES of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress... a blonde haired BOY with curly hair...

Charley slams the phone down, turning to Amy. 
CHARLEY God damn him. He-won't help us -- -Only Amy is gone, the hallway empty. Charley rushes toward the dance floor. 
101 INT. CLUB RADIO - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 
Charley emerges from the hall, looking about in the crush of people for Amy. Nothing; it's as if she's disappeared into thin air. He plunges out into the crowd.

101 CONTINUED: In another part of the bar area Charley moves among the people, desperately searching for Amy. He passes the drunken teenagers, ignoring them as he suddenly bumps into a table, a man yelling up at hiXi angrily. 
CORE USER Hey, watch out,.asshole! Charley glances down to see the table of users grouped around their mirror of white powder. He moves quickly away, searching for Amy. He stops by the wall of poseurs cruising everything that walks by, asking a girl that looks from behind as though she must be Amy's age. 
CHARLEY Pardon me, have you seen a girl, 
LIGHT-HAIRED --

101 CONTINUED: (2) The girl turns to him,. revealing herself as a woman well into her mid-forties, decked out like a teenager, Sylvia Miles ten years ago, staring at him hungrily. 
OLDER WOMAN Forget her, take me instead She reaches out to kiss Charley and he flees the crowd of flesh.watchers laughing at him as he goes. He moves along a wall of LESBIANS, stopping one, his des- peration growing. 
CHARLEY I'm looking for a girl -- 
LESBIAN So am I. Before Charley can recover a woman moves into her arms, Charley, shocked and disconcerted, backing away until he bumps to a halt against a heavy metal biker, the kind of guy who's into Twisted Sister. The parody of biker throws him to the floor for the insult, his friends, walking par- odies of bikers, laughing at Charley as he leaps to his feet and backs away into the crowd. He breaks free of the packed humanity, stopping on the stairs. It is at that moment that he catches a glimpse of Amy on the dance floor, dancing with Jerry. He hurries down the stairs and onto the floor. On the dance floor, Amy moves.with Jerry, their bodies locked together, slowly falling. into his eyes, dancing slower and slower with him until finally she has no will left of her own. She is "in love" with him. It is at that moment that she bends her head forward, laying it on his shoulder, exposing her neck to him, her eyes staring at the wall as they revolve around and around, Jerry bending down to kiss her neck, his mouth slowly opening. It is at that moment Amy sees her reflection in the mirrors mounted against one wall;.she is dancing alone. Shocked back to her senses, she goes rigid in Jerry's arms, trying to pull away from him, screaming as the music and the dancers stop. 
'AMY Charley! Across the dance floor, Charley hears her SCREAM and pushes his way through the sea of humanity, fighting his way to her side where she stands with Jerry, once again caught in his eyes, slowly losing her will. Charley grabs Jerry by the shoulder, trying to pull him away from Amy.

CHARLEY Let her go! Jerry looks down at him, smiling, mocking him as Amy sways in his arms, her eyes locked on. his face. 
JERRY What's wrong, Charley? Jealous? He grinds his pelvis against.Amy, dry humping her in front of Charley. She throws her head back, her mouth opening in .something close to ecstasy, her eyes glazed, staring up at him with adoration, giving herself to him as she cocks her head to one side, exposing her tender young throat. Charley goes crazy. 
CHARLEY You filthy son-of-a-bitch -- ! He swings at him only to have Jerry release Amy, catching Charley's fist in the palm of his hand easily. Be stares down at the boy, smiling cruelly. 
.JERRY You shouldn't lose your temper, Charley. It isn't polite. He tightens his grip, slowly squeezing Charley's fist. You can almost hear the knuckle bones grinding as Charley's face'contorts in agony, driving him to his knees before Jerry. Charley looks up at him, tears of pain streaming down his face. 
CHARLEY (gasping with pain) You can't kill me here -- 
JERRY I don't want to kill you, Charley. I -want you to bring Peter Vincent to my house, just the two of you. That is if you ever want to see Amy again. He casually releases Charley, letting the boy drop to the floor as he disappears with Amy into the swirling mass of dancers. Charley leaps to his feet, ignoring the pain in his hand and plunges after them. Charley breaks free of the swirl near the bar, looking everywhere and not seeing either of them. Suddenly he's grabbed by a strong, pair of arms. He looks up to find himself staring into the face of a huge, black BOUNCER.

CHARLEY 
(DESPERATELY) Let me go -- The man ignores him, calling back over his shoulder. 
BOUNCER' Hey, Donny, this the one? Another huge bouncer, the one the cook talked to when Charley and Amy sneaked into the club, steps out of the whirl staring down at the boy. 
DONNY Yeah, its him. 
(TO CHARLEY) Where's your girlfriend? Charley suddenly sees Jerry and Amy breaking through the throng, heading for the entrance. He points to them wildly. 
CHARLEY That's her, over there with that older 
GUYF

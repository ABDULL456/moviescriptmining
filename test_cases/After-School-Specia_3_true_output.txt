MATT I can't even watch it. Every time I turn it on, I keep thinking about that tuna fish sandwich and Coop farting all day long. DEACON That was pretty gross. MATT That's just it. The movie looks great, but seeing everything else -- all the disgusting, nasty stuff -- that's what's taken all the fun out of it. And I just don't want to do it any more. FRED Great. I knew it. I knew you couldn't handle this. Matt looks away. DEACON Take it easy, Fred. FRED No, I knew that when it came down to it, Matt would wuss out. Matt snaps. MATT You know what? Fuck you, Fred. You're the wuss here. At least I don't have to whack off every time I see a girl in the hallway. Fred shoves Matt. FRED Shut up, Matt. Matt stands up and gets in Fred's face. MATT No, you shut up! For once in your life, be a man and admit this movie was a mistake. FRED Why don't you make me? The two square off, staring each other down. Until, DEACON No. Matt's right. This movie was a mistake.

FRED What are you talking about? This whole thing was your idea. DEACON Come on, Fred. Didn't you think this movie was going to be ... I don't know, sexy? Fred looks at the other two for a beat, not sure what to say. Finally, he smiles. FRED How long have you guys known about the bathroom thing? Deacon laughs. MATT If you didn't like making the movie, why didn't you say something? FRED I don't know. I thought you guys were having fun. I didn't want to be the wuss. A beat. FRED (CONT'D) So what about the car? DEACON The Aerostar's not so bad. FRED What about the money and the power and the women? What about Tony Montana? MATT Scar Face is just a stupid movie, Fred. Fred smiles. MATT (CONT'D) So what do we do with this? He holds up the tape. 98   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK (CLOSED) - NIGHT                             98 The tape is burning in the center of a huge bonfire. A massive party is raging. Tons of teenagers are dancing, drinking, and having a good time rocking to a LIVE BAND. At the center of it all are Matt, Fred, and Deacon are finally enjoying themselves.

ASHLEY Hey, guys. Great party. DEACON Thanks. ASHLEY I've got some big news. I sent the reel to Vivid and they want to fly me and Coop to L.A. to talk about a contract. MATT Wow. That's great, Ashley. DEACON Congratulations. Deacon hugs her. BOUNCER (O.S.) Deacon! Vinnie says we need more ice! DEACON Hang on, guys. I'll be right back. He leaves Fred and Matt alone with Ashley. FRED Hey, Ashley. Can I ask you a question? ASHLEY Sure. FRED Do you think me and Matt will ever get girlfriends? ASHLEY Are you kidding? Come on, guys. You have it made. You're smart, funny, fun to be with. In a couple of years, girls will be dying to meet men like you. MATT Really? ASHLEY Well, no. Popular, good looking guys always get the girls. (off their look) Hey, what was I supposed to say? Then, Roger wheels by, arm in arm with his Hairdresser. No more braces and headgear, Roger looks sharp with slicked back hair and suave clothes.

{"train": "THE GRUDGE \nWritten by \nStephen Susco \nBased on the films Ju-on, Ju-on 2 and Ju-on: The Grudge By Takashi Shimizu \nProduction Draft - BLUE Revised, January 26, 2004 \n1   INT. PETER & MARIA'S BEDROOM - DAY                               1 \nFADE IN on MARIA (late 20s), asleep in bed. She's breathtakingly beautiful. Morning light fills the room.      The sound of wind, and rippling cloth. \nMaria stirs, and opens her eyes.     She stretches contentedly. \nThen she frowns.    Rolls over.    She's alone in the bed? \nNo, she's not: PETER (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her. Two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him. \nMARIA Hey.     Are you okay? \nPeter doesn't turn. He slowly stands and walks forward towards an OPEN WINDOW. \nThere's something strange about the way he moves -- stiffly, almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles. \nMaria gets out of bed, concerned. \nMARIA Peter?    What's the matter? \nHe pauses at the window.    Turns his head to look back at her. \nHis eyes are vacant.    His face is a blank. \nThen Peter slowly leans forward.     And falls from the window. \nMaria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES from outside reaches her ears. Then SCREAMS OF TERROR from below. \nAghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards the window. We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL -- \n-- PETER'S BODY lies in the middle of the street.     His head has burst open, his body broken and twisted. \nON THE PAVEMENT: a line of blood appears, moving down the center of the screen. As if hitting grooves we cannot see -- \n-- the blood slowly forms the shape of two KANJI CHARACTERS. A translation appears over them: \"The Grudge.\" \n2   EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY                                         2 \nA blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a subway tunnel. Most are Japanese. We're not in Kansas. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     2. \nStanding in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is \nKAREN (20s, American). She faces upstream, looking for someone. The flow threatens to carry her away in a heartbeat. She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness. \nDOUG (O.S.) Karen! \nShe turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s, American) approaching. With a reassuring smile he takes her hand -- \n-- and together, they force their way through the throng, trying to escape the flow. They're jostled and crushed by the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer. \nKAREN I'll never get used to this. \nDOUG Maybe we should find a different train station. \nHe abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still holding Karen's hand. She turns, wondering what's going on. She sees the smile on his lips a moment before -- \n-- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her. As if the crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all. \nIt's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.   But then she pulls away, shy. \nKAREN A public display of affection is considered rude in Japan. \nThere's an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET.   Doug and Karen deftly slip out of the traffic -- \n2a                                                                 2a OMITTED \n2b   EXT. TOKYO STREET - DAY                                       2b \n-- and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street, away from the crowded thoroughfare. \nDoug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL COUPLES, making out on the street corner. He turns to give Karen a sarcastic look -- \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      2A. \nALEX Are you free this afternoon? \nKAREN I just came by to pick up some books I left here. I'm not scheduled to work today -- \nALEX I know. But are you free?    Do you have class? \nKAREN (shaking her head:) Just a test to study for.   Why? \nAlex smiles, holding out a file. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04    6. \nALEX Your wish has been granted. \nKaren takes the file and opens it, looking at the first page - - a picture of an OLDER WOMAN (EMMA) is attached. \nALEX It's Yoko's case, but she didn't show up for work this morning, and I can't reach her at home. She must be sick, or something. And she has the damn house key. \nStudying the file, Karen squints. \nKAREN What's this phrase? \nALEX \"Mild dementia with severe lethargy.\" Apparently she sleeps through most of the day. Her daughter-in-law doesn't work, so she'll probably be there. \nKaren seems unsure.   It's a big step for her. \nALEX You're the one who's been bugging me about getting out there on your own. Besides, it's an English-only house. \nOne of Alex's CO-WORKERS appears in the doorway, motioning to him. Alex quickly hands Karen a card: \nALEX Here's the address. Use the wall chart if you need help -- and don't forget to bring a map. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     7. \nKaren looks at THE ADDRESS -- a string of thirty numbers and Japanese characters. She glances up at \nTHE WALL CHART: a color-coded diagram shows how the long address string is broken down into Postal Code, Prefecture, City, Ward, District, Block, Sub-Block and House Number. \nALEX Don't worry Karen, you're ready. \nKaren nods.   But she's not quite as confident. \n3     OMITTED                                                         3 \n4     OMITTED                                                         4 \n4a    INT. RAIL STATION - DAY                                     4a \nPeople rush madly around Karen as she studies A LARGE MAP on the wall. It's the Tokyo rail system -- daunting, at best. \n4b                                                                4b OMITTED \n4bb   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                           4bb \nKaren sits uncomfortably on the crowded transit car, squeezed in tightly by the people around her. The LOUD CRYING of a baby adds to her discomfort. \n5     EXT. RAIL PLATFORM - DAY                                        5 \nThe transit car pulls to a stop and a handful of people get out. Karen is one of them, shouldering her backpack. \n5a                                                                5a EXT. SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY Karen walks down the populated sidewalk, weaving through STREET VENDORS, and passing a large GROCERY STORE. \nShe pauses, looking at the address on her card. She approaches a WOMAN and her DAUGHTER (6) and speaks to them in Japanese. The woman nods, pointing towards a small ALLEY. \nKaren gives the daughter a smile;   the girl hides behind her mother's leg. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      7A. \n6    EXT. TOKYO NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY                                   6 \nKaren exits the alley, entering a quiet, narrow street. She's still not sure if she's in the right place. \nBut then her eyes fix on something. She begins to walk towards it, her gaze never leaving it -- \n6a   EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY                                          6a \n-- it's THE HOUSE.   Cozy and shaded, nestled into the dead end of the street.   Large by Tokyo standards. \nShe double-checks the address and opens the gate, walking around a BICYCLE leaning against the wall and following the stepping-stone path to the front door. She knocks. No answer. She tries again. Nothing. \nThen, an afterthought, she tries the handle.   It's unlocked. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     8. \n7    INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY                                7 \nKaren walks back into the Living Room. She looks underneath the couch for the missing piece. Can't see anything. \nShe lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling around. Nothing. \nKaren sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining... \nShe suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing.   She has a small cut on her finger. \nKaren looks under the couch for what cut her -- \n-- a small FURNITURE NAIL sticks out underneath. \nKAREN Nice one, Karen. \nShe gets to her feet, folding up the incomplete picture and stuffing it into her pocket. \nINT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DUSK Karen steps into the foyer with the vacuum cleaner. She looks up at A RAILING overhead. Some trash is visible sticking over the edge. Karen shakes her head: \nKAREN How did you get up there? \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       11. \nShe gathers up the vacuum and heads up to the SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY. There's a nearby door, closed (the FRONT ROOM), and an open door at the end (the REAR ROOM). \nAs she looks for an outlet, she hears a SCRATCHING SOUND. \nKaren stands there for a moment, listening.    Silence. \nThen she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall. \n17   INT. THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DUSK                            17 \nKaren steps inside. MOVING BOXES are stacked against the wall, next to a desk. It's an unfinished room. \nShe listens.   No scratching.   Nothing unusual here.   Except -- \nKaren notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty shelf. It's a BLACK CERAMIC CAT. Facing the wall. Strange. \nAnd then Karen hears the SCRATCHING SOUND again. \nINT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK Karen steps into the hallway and listens.   There it is again, and this time there's no doubt -- \nThe sounds are coming from the room by the stairs. \nKaren walks to the door. She pauses, disturbed by the eerie sounds from inside. Then she reaches for the doorknob. \nTHUD. THUD. Karen hesitates. The strange rhythmic THUDDING continues, coming from beyond the door. \nKAREN (nervous:) Hello? \nKaren takes a breath.   And turns the doorknob. \nINT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DUSK The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER BEDROOM. It's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. A frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much. \nShe stands there for a moment, listening.   Silence. \nThen -- \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     12. \nSCRATCH SCRATCH. Startled, she gasps and turns towards THE CLOSED CLOSET DOORS. That's where the sound is coming from. \nAnd then she notices something strange about the closet door: \nIt's been sealed shut with duct tape. \nThe SCRATCHING quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby. \nAnd then there's a muffled MEOW.   There's a cat in there? \nKaren pulls off the duct tape. She reaches for the door handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside -- \nThe closet seems empty, except for a large BOOK on a shelf. Karen reaches inside and picks it up. \nThen she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a SMALL BLACK CAT. It's sitting on something, watching her. \nKaren slides the door the rest of the way open -- \n-- revealing A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY (age 7) sitting in the corner, staring at Karen. The cat is curled up on his lap. \nStartled, Karen drops the book and falls backwards. \nINT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Karen is on her cell phone: \nKAREN (INTO PHONE) Yes, he was shut in a closet! There was tape around the -- No, they're not home yet. I don't know, Emma hasn't said a word to me -- He's still upstairs -- yes, I'm sure he's Japanese -- But -- Yes, alright, Alex. Just please get here as soon as you can. \nEmma looks up at Karen with pleading eyes. \nEMMA I just want her to leave me alone. \nKaren sits down next to her. \nKAREN You should get some rest, Emma. \nShe helps Emma lie back -- \n-- but as the old woman's eyes move to the ceiling, they suddenly grow wide, her mouth opening in fear -- \n-- Karen follows her gaze, looking up -- \n-- and she SCREAMS, falling off the mattress, backing away -- \nA MURKY BLACKNESS is lowering from the ceiling. Formless at first, but flowing and shifting... like a FIGURE draped with black silk. Drifting down until the shadowy \"head\" is only inches from Emma's terrified face. \nAnd then the \"head\" slowly turns, rotating towards Karen. \nIn the midst of the blackness are TWO DISEMBODIED EYES. Filled with an intense rage. Focused directly on Karen. \nOff Karen's NERVE-SHATTERING SCREAM, we... \nCUT TO BLACK. \nINT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT MATTHEW and his wife JENNIFER are in bed. He sleeps soundly, she doesn't. She's staring at the ceiling, listening to -- \n-- SOUNDS coming in through the open bedroom door. Someone moving downstairs, fumbling around, bumping into things. \nJennifer, frustrated, lets out a sigh. \nINT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - MORNING \nMatthew comes downstairs, dressed in a business suit.    He pauses to pick up some of the RUBBISH on the stairs. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   16. \n26   INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING                          26 \nJennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot. She pours herself a mug, takes a big sip. Looks exhausted. \nMatthew enters, surprised to see her. \nMATTHEW You're up? \nJENNIFER Mmmmmm. \nMatthew glances into the back room through another sliding door -- the windows on this one are clear, not frosted like the living room. \nHIS POV:   Emma is asleep on her mattress. \nMATTHEW I wonder if Mom's okay. She's been sleeping ever since we got here. \nJENNIFER Not at night. \nMatthew turns to her, surprised. \nJENNIFER I told you, Matthew, you can sleep through anything. \nMatthew comes over, kisses her. \nMATTHEW I'm sorry, sweetheart. It was probably just the move -- I'm sure she'll get back on schedule. \nJennifer nods, not convinced. \nMATTHEW You seen my travel mug? \nJENNIFER I didn't unpack it yet. \nMatthew kneels down next to a pair of MOVING BOXES in the corner -- `KITCHEN' written on the side. He explores it. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   17. \nMATTHEW Maybe you should say something to the helper, what's her name? \nJENNIFER Yoko. \nMATTHEW Who knows? Maybe there's something she can suggest. \nJENNIFER Yeah.     Maybe. \nHe finds his travel mug, wrapped in the sports section of an American newspaper. Matthew scans it as he fills his mug. \nMATTHEW I miss seeing this every morning. No response from his wife. He turns to see Jennifer looking down at Emma through the window. \nAnd they lead away from the back room, down the main hallway. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      20. \nJennifer looks back up to see Emma watching her. \n30   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY                                30 \nJennifer follows the DAMP FOOTPRINTS. They're getting lighter, and cease altogether in the foyer. \nShe stands there for a moment, bewildered. Then she tenses, as if sensing she's being watched. She slowly turns to see -- \n-- A BLACK CAT. Sitting on the first landing of the stairs. Staring at her with bright yellow eyes. \nAs Jennifer takes a step towards it -- \nTWO CHILD'S HANDS reach around the corner, and pick up the cat, pulling it out of view. \nJennifer freezes. \nJENNIFER Who's -- who's there? \nNo response. She walks up the stairs and looks around the corner. Nothing there. \nShe takes a deep breath, and starts to climb. \nINT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY Reaching the top, Jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar BOY running into the FRONT ROOM. \nShe slowly walks towards the open door -- we can't see inside the room from the hallway. But she pauses as she hears -- \nTHUD.   THUD.   The same rhythmic thumping that Karen heard. \nAfter a moment, Jennifer steps inside the room, disappearing from our sight. \nWe hear her suddenly draw a GASP. \nA beat. As we DRIFT CLOSER to the doorway, we notice something strange: the room appears to be growing darker. A SHARP BREATHING can be heard from inside... quick, panicked gulps of air. Growing faster. \nJust as we reach the doorway, the harsh breathing stops. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   20A. \nA moment of stillness. \nThen the door is SLAMMED SHUT from the inside. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      21. \n32   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                 32 \nMatthew enters from work, jacket slung over his shoulder. \nMATTHEW (calling out) Sorry I'm late, it took awhile to wrap things up. \nHe leaves his briefcase by the door and turns to the hall -- \n-- noticing the house is completely DARK. \nMATTHEW Jen?   Susan? \nINT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Matthew turns on the lights. The room has reverted to its messy state, even worse than before. \nHe looks down at A PICTURE, formerly hanging on the wall, now lying on the ground. The glass is broken. \nMATTHEW What the hell? -- \nHe quickly goes to the BACK ROOM. Emma sits on the edge of her bed, dazed and staring. In the darkness. \nMATTHEW Mom?   Are you alright? \nNo answer.    He kneels down next to her. \nMATTHEW Where's Jennifer, Mom? \nStill nothing.      He surveys the mess in the room.   Angrily: \nMATTHEW Did Yoko come today, Mom? Remember? The pretty girl? \nHe gets to his feet, looking at the SPILLED SOUP in the living room, now hardened and crusty. \n34   INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                     34 \nOVER THE RAILING:     Matthew re-enters the foyer, looking up. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     22. \nJENNIFER Why? \nSusan asks Suzuki in Japanese.    He shrugs. \nSUZUKI (trying his English:) Ex-pen-sive. \nMatthew suddenly realizes: \nMATTHEW Where's Mom? \nWe slowly CRANE UP to the SECOND FLOOR HALL, moving towards the REAR ROOM at the end. The door is ajar. \n44a                                                            44a INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY Susan comes up the stairs, worried. \nSUSAN Mom?   Where are you? \n44b   INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY                        44b \nSusan looks inside -- Emma isn't there. She's about to leave when something catches her attention. She walks to \nTHE CLOSET. The door is open. Susan kneels down, looking at something inside it. She picks it up -- \n-- it's the CERAMIC CAT Karen found earlier. As Susan examines it, she notices something on the wall of the closet (which we don't see). Her face softens, and she smiles. \nMATTHEW (O.S.) Did you get her? \nSUSAN (under her breath:) Take a pill, will ya? \nSusan stands and walks out of the room. But we stay in the closet, PANNING TO REVEAL the closet wall. It's covered with BLACK CRAYON, low to the ground, the work of a child. The images are dozens of BLACK CATS. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      29A. \n45   INT. THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DAY                             45 \nEmma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom. \nLooking directly up at the ceiling. \nSusan enters, placing the ceramic cat on THE SHELF where Karen found it earlier. Except Susan faces it INTO THE ROOM. \nSUSAN C'mon, Mom. You know what the doctor said about stairs. \nShe takes Emma's hand, but the old woman doesn't move. \nMatthew and Jennifer enter, worried. \nMATTHEW She okay? \nSUSAN Mom?   What is it? \nEveryone follows her gaze to the ceiling.   Only Emma has the unmistakable look of dread on her face. \nA long beat. \nINT. THE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY Suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway, giving the place one final look-over. \nHe pauses by the open bathroom door.   Looks inside. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       30. \n47   INT. THE HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY                                  47 \nSuzuki enters, looking at THE TUB:    filled to the brim. \nAfter a moment, Suzuki kneels down next to the bathtub.     He pulls the thin CHAIN connected to the rubber stopper -- \n-- but the end of the chain comes out of the water.      Hmmm. It's not connected after all. \nSuzuki eyes the plug at the bottom of the tub. \nThen he takes off his jacket.   Rolls up his shirt sleeve. \nAnd reaches into the water for the rubber stopper. \nIt's just out of reach. \nHe rolls up his sleeve a little more.   Reaches deeper -- \n-- suddenly there's a BURST OF SOUND: a dull THUMPING, something THRASHING in water, the SCREAMING of a YOUNG BOY, voice MUFFLED by water -- \n-- Suzuki recoils as water SPLASHES UP around him -- \n-- he falls away from the tub in horror, landing on his butt. \nTHE BATHTUB: Filled to the brim.     Still and silent.    Not so much as a ripple on the surface. \n49b   OMITTED                                                    49b \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        33. \n49c    OMITTED                                                     49c \n49cc   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - 10TH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT             49cc \n-- but her lucky RABBIT'S FOOT gets caught on the door latch. Panicking, Susan struggles to free herself -- \nThrough the crack, she sees the darkness continuing to come down. The lights on Susan's floor FLICKER. \nSusan looks up to see A PALE BOY on the landing to the higher floor. The SAME BOY is also standing on the landing of each floor above. They're all staring down at Susan. \nSusan screams as she desperately tries to yank her chain free... and then she sees THE PALE HAND clutching her rabbit's foot! \nThe door shuts, and Susan falls backwards into the hallway. \nShe jumps to her feet and runs down the hall. \n50     OMITTED                                                      50 \n51     OMITTED                                                      51 \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      34. \n52     OMITTED                                                      52 \n52a    OMITTED                                                     52a \n53     INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT                 53 \nA cramped room. Susan stands in the doorway, animatedly talking to a young SECURITY GUARD sitting at a desk lined with VIDEO MONITORS. She's speaking rapidly, and shaking: \nSUSAN (IN JAPANESE) In the stairs... there was... something... a strange person... all the lights were going out... \nThe Guard doesn't understand her -- in her panic, Susan's MISPRONOUNCING HER WORDS, and she knows it. \nSusan takes a breath, frustrated and frightened. \nSUSAN (pleading, in English) Please. Help me. \nThe Guard stands, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \nGUARD (IN JAPANESE) I'll take a look. Wait here. \nThe Guard leaves.

It's obvious that she feels safer, here in the Security Room. \nThen she notices movement on one of the SECURITY MONITORS -- \nON THE SCREEN: -- the GUARD continues down the 10TH FLOOR HALL, stopping at the door to the stairwell. \nSusan leans toward the monitor for a better view. \nON THE SCREEN: the Guard opens the stairwell door and leans inside, checking it out. \nON SUSAN:   her eyes are glued to the screen.   Waiting. \nON THE SCREEN: the Guard, finding nothing out of the ordinary, closes the door and continues on down the hall. \nSUSAN leans back, exhaling.    Relieved. \nThen the video CRACKLES with a sudden quick burst of static. \nAnd Susan GASPS, sitting upright, as she sees -- \nON THE SCREEN:   the stairwell door OPENS AGAIN.

Silence. \nSusan's breathing slows. But she looks around the room, still anxious -- it's too quiet in here. Her panic builds. But she's alone in the room, isn't she? \nAs we MOVE IN on Susan, the room starts to become quieter. The SOUND OF TRAFFIC from outside, the HUMMING REFRIGERATOR in the kitchen... everything fades to a stifling silence. \nAnd Susan notices, all right.    Her breath, now suddenly loud, catches in her throat. \nA long moment of silence.   Then -- \n-- DRIP.   DRIP. \nIt's coming from the KITCHEN SINK. \nSusan stares at it.

She reaches out and turns the faucet handle. Tightens it. The dripping stops. \nRelieved, Susan turns away -- \n-- DRIP.   DRIP.   It begins again.   Louder, more intense. \nScared, Susan turns back to the sink. Water is now GUSHING OUT from the faucet, filling up a bowl in the sink. \nShe slowly reaches out a hand and turns the faucet, as tightly as she can manage -- \n-- tighter... tighter... straining with the effort.. \nUntil the water stops.   Only then does she let go -- \n-- just then, a CHILD'S PALE HAND quietly rises to the surface from water in the bowl, and starts VIOLENTLY SPLASHING the surface. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        38A. \nSusan screams and runs back to her bedroom -- \n62b   INT.

Her eyes widen. \nHer hand reaches up under her pillow, feeling around -- \n-- and she comes out with HER LUCKY RABBIT'S FOOT. \nThe one she left behind in the stairwell. \nSusan suddenly CRIES OUT, her head tilting back, her body abruptly going stiff. We soon see why: \nA LUMP begins to rise at the foot of the bed. A big one. Moving slowly up Susan's body.

Waits. She seems to have expected this: she pulls a KEY from her pocket, with a plastic LABEL on it. \nINT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY Yoko steps inside. She instinctively slips off her shoes.

She takes it, opens it. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         46A. \nTHE LETTER says, simply:   \"Out for a walk, back later.\" \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       47. \nYOKO Emma?   It's Yoko.

THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                           79 \nThe house is the least \"moved-into\" that we've seen so far: although the main furniture is in place, MOVING BOXES are stacked in every room, in various stages of unpacking. \nBut there's also an unusual amount of mess in the house -- a disarray, much like the opening sequence, that isn't exactly related to moving in. \nYoko surveys the room, dismayed by the mess. \nThen she sees EMMA at the far end of the living room, her back to Yoko. She's looking down at something in her hands. \nYOKO Hi, Emma.    It's good to see you again. \nEmma turns. Looks blankly at Yoko, who approaches. Realizing the woman doesn't remember her: \nYOKO My name is Yoko. \nThe old woman still gives no sign of recognition.   Yoko gently takes her arm. \nYOKO You should be in bed -- \nThen she sees what Emma was looking at: the roll of DUCT TAPE. She's cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade. \nYOKO (IN JAPANESE) You shouldn't be playing with this! \nShaking her head, Yoko takes the duct tape and looks around for a place where Emma can't get at it -- \n-- she puts the tape ON THE STACK OF BOOKS at the top of the bookshelf, next to the scissors (where Matthew found them). \nOMITTED \n81   OMITTED                                                      81 \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        48. \n81a   INT.

The old woman must be asleep: Yoko gently lays down the tray, quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut. \nThen Yoko moves through the LIVING ROOM to the PHONE BASE -- \n-- she picks up THE CORDLESS, finally where it belongs. \nYoko dials a number as she walks into THE ENTRANCE HALL.     She begins a conversation (in Japanese) as she looks at the scattered rubbish on the ground, shaking her head. \nShe climbs up to the SECOND FLOOR, pausing to kneel and pick up some pieces of crumpled paper, chatting all the while. \nTHUD. THUD. Yoko pauses, turning towards the open door to the front room. The rhythmic THUMPING continues. \n82    OMITTED                                                       82 \n-- THE ATTIC PANEL above her is wide open. \nCaught between a rock and a hard place.   Yoko decides: \nShe shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull herself into the attic. \nINT. ATTIC - DAY Yoko's head appears. Then her shoulders.     She looks around, but can't see a thing in the darkness. \nShe's about to pull herself all the way up -- \n-- when she hears the THROATY CROAKING SOUND. \nComing from the darkness. \nYoko stiffens, her breath catching in her throat. \nANOTHER POV: we're at the far end of the attic, suddenly and rapidly RACING FORWARD TOWARDS YOKO... \nON YOKO:   something brushes her face.   Long, black hair. \nThere's a head, just inches from hers.    Almost nose-to-nose. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      51. \nYoko is paralyzed with fear, eyes wide.   A long beat. \nThen she reaches into her pocket, pulling out a LIGHTER. \nYoko raises it and flicks the wheel -- \n-- we get a glimpse of a PALE FACE, surrounded by long black hair, eyes wide and mouth open, the THROATY SOUND suddenly increasing in pitch and volume -- \n-- as the face moves forward -- \nCUT TO BLACK. \n89   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                    89 \nKaren slowly wakes up in bed.    As her eyes clear, she sees -- \nDOUG. He sits on the edge of the bed, slightly slumped, his back to her. \nHe slowly turns -- and a relieved smile crosses his face.     He moves closer, and reaches out a hand. \nDOUG It's okay.     I've got you. \nKaren nods, lacing her fingers in his. But her eyes are glazed and unfocused -- she's exhausted. \nDOUG Your boss told me what happened. I'm sorry. \nShe turns away, the memory bothering her.    Doug takes her hand, massaging her fingers, worried. \nDOUG I talked to your teachers. They said you can take as much time as you need. We could go to Kyoto for a weekend, see those temples you're always talking about. \nKaren tries to smile back, but her heart's not in it. \nKAREN Running away won't help. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   51aA. \nDOUG There's nothing to run away from, Kat.

Doug waits. \nKAREN That house. There was something... \nDoug sees her frustration, and tenderly brushes a hair from her face. \nDOUG Don't beat yourself up searching for a greater truth, Kat. An old woman passed away in her sleep. It's sad, but that's all it is -- \nKAREN Is that how they said she died? \nDOUG I'm sorry this happened to you. But maybe, in a way, it will help you later. Death is an unfortunate but integral part of your future career. There's no avoiding it. Maybe now you'll be more... ready for it. \nKAREN I don't think I'll ever be ready for something like that. \nShe turns away. Doug wraps an arm around her.   Karen leans into him, and he strokes her hair. \nKAREN Detective Nakagawa? \nHe looks up at her, a faraway look in his eyes. \nKAREN The whole time I was in that house, I felt something was... wrong. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     54A. \nFrom the expression on Nakagawa's face, she's onto something. \nKAREN What happened there? \nNakagawa holds Karen's gaze for a moment.

Igarashi stands in the doorway. He speaks to Nakagawa in Japanese. \nNAKAGAWA (to Karen) Please excuse me for a moment. \nNakagawa puts the photo down and steps into the hallway and closes the door, but not all the way. Karen watches and listens through the crack: \nINT. HOSPIAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT IN THE HALLWAY:   the men speak with hushed voices. \nIGARASHI (IN JAPANESE) We checked the apartment of Susan, the sister. She wasn't there... \nHe trails off, hesitating. \nNAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) Yes? \nIGARASHI (IN JAPANESE) The chain lock had been drawn from the inside. And the deadbolt. But we found no one in the apartment. \nNakagawa takes this in. \nNAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) Get the surveillance tapes from the office building. \nIgarashi nods.    But doesn't move.

Karen sits back in bed, disturbed. \nThen her attention turns to THE FILE on the table. \nShe considers.   Then reaches for it.   Opens it. \nIt's a POLICE REPORT, in Japanese. \nKaren scans it, and turns the page.     She draws a breath -- \n-- it's a photo of THE HOUSE. Cordoned off with police tape. An ambulance out front. Like the scene she just left... \n...only the picture is dated three years ago. \nTHREE DETECTIVES are visible beyond the open front door, conferring in the entryway. \nThe photo of the house is attached to a POLICE REPORT, with THREE PICTURES. A stern-looking Japanese man (TAKEO), a somber woman (KAYAKO), and a YOUNG BOY we know very well -- \nKaren makes the connection. She picks up the taped-up photo and compares it to the file... the boy and his father are the same as in the newspaper. \nKaren gently touches the \"missing\" face of KAYAKO -- then her eyes move to the picture of THE BOY. \nHer eyes widen as she reads THE JAPANESE TEXT under his face: \nKAREN Toshio... \nINT.

Between them is a small cart -- a bloody cloth on top. \nNakagawa and Igarashi enter. The Coroner stands, nervous. He walks to one of the tables and pulls back the sheet. \nNAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) Have you determined a cause of death? \nCORONER (IN JAPANESE) Not yet. The blood on his body -- isn't his. It belongs to her. \nHe points to the other table.    But doesn't look at it. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     60. \nNAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) I don't understand. He killed Yoko, before he died? \nThe Coroner shakes his head. Nakagawa looks to Igarashi, then walks up to the second body, pulling back the sheet. \nIT'S YOKO.    Still missing her jawbone. \nNakagawa and Igarashi stare down at her in disbelief. \nThe Coroner walks to the small table, removing the cloth. Yoko's JAWBONE is underneath it. \nCORONER (IN JAPANESE) The jawbone you found in the attic yesterday with the American couple belongs to this girl. I estimate it was -- removed -- from her body two or three days ago. \nIGARASHI (IN JAPANESE) But I thought you said her body was found with this man, tonight. The Coroner nods.    Eyes on his shoes. \nNAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) Then how did she get from the house to the Health Center? \nThe Coroner, lost in his imagination, answers quietly: \nCORONER (IN JAPANESE) I have no idea. \nA beat.   Nakagawa walks to the jawbone.   Stares at it. \nNAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) She survived for two days without this? \nCORONER (IN JAPANESE) It would seem so. \nNAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) How is that possible? \nThe Coroner looks up at him, his face pale. \nCORONER (IN JAPANESE) I don't believe it is. \nRevisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       61. \n100    INT.

She looks angry. \nKAREN Why didn't you tell me? \nDOUG Tell you what? \nKAREN About the bodies they found in the attic. \nDOUG You were recovering from a shock.

A scanned picture of the newspaper appears -- the article is on the front page, with familiar photos of Toshio, Kayako and Takeo. \nBut then Karen's eyes drift to another picture at the bottom of the page -- \n-- PETER. She quickly recognizes him from the picture she found in the journal. His name is printed below the photo. A picture of Peter and Maria's CONDO BUILDING is next to it. \nShe looks at the headline:   \"AMERICAN ENGLISH TEACHER THROWS SELF FROM BUILDING\". \nKaren scans the article, thinking.

It's the surveillance video you requested. \nIt takes a moment for Nakagawa to snap out of it. \nHe finally nods, takes the tape. He opens the envelope and looks at the cassette. Like he doesn't want to watch it. \nThen he turns to a TV/VCR combo and inserts the tape. \nON THE SCREEN: the 10TH FLOOR HALLWAY from Susan's office building, and the door leading to the stairwell. \nA beat.

A strange HUMMING RATTLE comes from the speakers, and the image JITTERS madly. \nNakagawa leans forward, right up to the screen, trying to make out an image in the swirling blackness -- \nTwo eyes open, staring at Nakagawa. Terrified, Nakagawa stands and turns away, closing his eyes. \nAnd when he finds the strength to look back -- \n-- THE EYES are still there. \nLocked onto him, even though he's moved. \nUnflinching.

Now we can see what they are -- \nPETER (IN JAPANESE) Hello. \nNo reaction. There's definitely something wrong with this boy. Peter looks beyond him, into the dark house. \nPETER (IN JAPANESE) My name is Peter. I'm here to see your mother. Is she home? \nThe boy slowly straightens. His eyes focus on Peter. Then he FALLS BACKWARDS. Startled, Peter tries to see inside: \nPETER (IN JAPANESE) Hey!   Are you okay??? Hello??? \nPeter quickly goes back to the front door.   Tries the handle - - it's unlocked. He opens the door. \nINT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY Peter steps inside, unsure about entering uninvited. \nPETER (IN JAPANESE) (calling out) Hello? Excuse me. I'm coming in. \nHis concern for the boy wins out. He kicks off his shoes, and quickly walks to the open bathroom door. \nOMITTED \n123   INT. THE HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY                            123 \nPeter enters, finding Toshio lying on the floor.

THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                             124 \nPeter holds Toshio's hand as he leads him back to a couch in the living room. \nPETER (IN JAPANESE) Are you alone? Where are your parents? \nThe boy sits in the couch, slumped over, still looking dazed. \nPeter studies him, looking at the ugly BRUISES on his arms and legs. There's also a big one around his neck. \nPETER (IN JAPANESE) What happened to you? \nPeter reaches out to lift Toshio's chin, but he FLINCHES, pulling backwards. His eyes manage to focus on Peter. \nThen the boy looks away.    Lowers his head.   A long beat. \nPeter's worried. This really doesn't look good.     He scans the messy room, eyes falling on something. \nHe reaches down and picks up PIECES OF A PHOTOGRAPH, lying next to a broken frame -- they've been crumpled into a ball. \nON THE PHOTO: Peter unfolds the pieces and rearranges them.

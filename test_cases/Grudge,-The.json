It's got a computer, some files.     Someone's personal work space. \nPeter steps to the desk. He picks up A STACK OF PHOTOGRAPHS.

It's been written over and over, in both English and Japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it. \nPast the early pages Karen saw, THE WRITING becomes more manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl, KAYAKO'S VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading. \nTaped on the final page is A PHOTO: PETER with a group of his University friends, at a party. Kayako has scribbled hearts around his head, and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces. \nA bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peter's face.   It's still wet. \nPeter slams the book shut and drops it. As he does, a PHOTOGRAPH falls out from inside, landing right-side up. \nTHE PHOTO is of PETER at a college party, talking with MARIA. It's clear they're having a great time with one another... \n...but the photo is TORN IN HALF, splitting Maria's face.

One of the missing pieces from the torn- out photographs. \nPeter slowly looks up to see -- \n-- ALL THE MISSING KAYAKO FACES have been pinned to the closet door. Many of the pins go through HER EYES. \nAnd that's when Peter and Karen hear THE FLIES.   Buzzing anxiously. Sounds like there's a lot of them. \nIt's coming from THE CLOSET.

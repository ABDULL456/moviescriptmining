{"test1_input": "DISSOLVE TO: \nspread out on a table in the Royal Suite. Camera pulls back to a LONGER SHOT. We see Mercier, the jeweler, examining the jewels with an eyepiece screwed in his eye. Around him stand the Three Russians. Mercier, a middle-aged man of the greatest suavity and elegance, but a shrewd trader none the less, looks up. \nMERCIER Very good... superb... excellent... it would be foolish to belittle the quality of the merchandise but your terms are impossible. My counteroffer is the absolute maximum. \nKOPALSKI But, Monsieur Mercier... \nMERCIER (continuing) Gentlemen, I'll let you in on a little secret... we are only undertaking this deal for the prestige involved, and, quite frankly, we are expecting to take a loss. \nIranoff draws Buljanoff aside and whispers in his ear. \nIRANOFF (whispering) Capitalistic methods... \nBULJANOFF They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss. \nThe telephone rings. \nBULJANOFF (answering phone) Hello... this is Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski... Who?... Count d'Algout?... No, no... it must be a mistake... we can't be disturbed. \nMERCIER (continuing) I assure you no one else could meet the figure named by my syndicate... at least under the present economic conditions. \nKOPALSKI We can wait. \nIRANOFF (pompously) Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money? \nMERCIER Yes. Gentlemen... let's put our cards face down. Right now there is a Russian commission in New York trying to sell fifteen Rembrandts. There is another in London mortgaging the oil fields in Baku. You need money and you need it quickly. I think my offer is fair and does not even take advantage of your situation. \nCLOSE-UP -- BULJANOFF, IRANOFF, AND KOPALSKI \nKOPALSKI (to Mercier) Just a minute. \nThe Three Russians step to one side. \nIRANOFF (in a low voice) He's cutting our throat... \nBULJANOFF But what can we do?... We have to accept. \nKOPALSKI Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia. \nBULJANOFF All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes. \nSHOT OF THE WHOLE GROUP \nThere is a knock at the door. Iranoff walks toward it, unlocks it, opens it a little. In the door appears Leon. \nIRANOFF We don't want to be disturbed. \nLEON My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned. \nIRANOFF If you want to see us you must come later. \nLEON I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier. \nIRANOFF But you can't... \nLeon pushes his way in. He approaches Monsieur Mercier. The Russians get between him and the jewels and during the following scene put them back into the safe. \nLEON Monsieur Mercier. May I introduce myself? I am Count Leon d'Algout. I think I had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop. I was admiring a platinum watch with diamond numbers. \nMERCIER Oh, yes, yes... \nLEON (glancing at the jewels) Glorious, aren't they? \nKOPALSKI Now, monsieur, you have no right... \nLEON (very charmingly) Just a moment. (to Mercier) I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties. \nALL THREE RUSSIANS Who are you? What do you want? What is this? \nLEON These jewels are the property of the Duchess Swana of Russia, and were seized illegally by the Soviet Government. I am acting for Her Highness, the Duchess. Here is my power of attorney. \nHe hands it to Mercier, who reads it. \nIRANOFF (excitedly) You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense. \nKOPALSKI These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State. \nLEON We'll leave the problem of their ownership to the French courts. Meanwhile I have filed a petition for an injunction to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels. Here is a copy. \nThe Russians take the copy of the injunction, read it flabbergasted. As they do so, Leon turns to Monsieur Mercier. \nLEON I thought it my duty to warn you. I would hate to see you get in any trouble, monsieur. \nMERCIER Thank you. (he turns to the Russians) Gentlemen, this introduces a new element into our negotiations. Until this claim is completely settled... \nKOPALSKI We can call our ambassador. \nIRANOFF I give you my word! They were confiscated legally! \nMERCIER Please try to understand my position. I am not with-drawing. My offer stands and as soon as you produce a clear title, approved by the French courts, the deal is settled. Until then, good day. \n", "test1_true": "LEON (intimately) I hope you will forgive me, Monsieur Mercier. \nMERCIER (in a low voice) On the contrary. I consider myself very lucky. Good day. \nHe bows. \nLEON (bowing) Good day, monsieur. \nMercier leaves. Leon closes the door and turns back into the room to the three outraged Russians. \nLEON (jauntily) Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch? \nIRANOFF Get out of here! \nLEON Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance. \nKOPALSKI (bursting forth) We may have a chance. \nLEON Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case. \nKOPALSKI We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer! \nLEON All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge! \nIRANOFF That won't help you! You can't intimidate us! \nKOPALSKI Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case. \nBULJANOFF You think because you represent the former Duchess... \nLEON The Duchess... \nBULJANOFF The former Duchess! \nLEON In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand... \nIRANOFF All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say? \nLEON But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you? \nIRANOFF I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels? \nLEON Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible. \nBULJANOFF Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind? \nLEON Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition? \nIRANOFF What proposition? \nLEON I just said let's have a little lunch. (picking up the telephone) Room service. \nMEDIUM SHOT -- CORRIDOR OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE \nDISSOLVE TO: \nshooting toward door leading to the Royal Suite. Two waiters are wheeling in a table on which is a block of ice filled with caviar and a collection of the most delicious hors d'oeuvres. They enter the room. After the door is closed we hear from within loud SOUNDS of approval from Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski. The CAMERA STAYS on the door. After a few seconds a very good-looking cigarette girl enters the room and from within we HEAR even louder SOUNDS of approval. Next a waiter enters carrying champagne and another with glasses on a tray. As they are going into the room, the cigarette girl comes out and runs excitedly down the corridor. Camera pans with her away from the door as she starts down the staircase. \nMEDIUM SHOT -- DOOR OF THE ROYAL SUITE \nSome of the waiters come out, others go in, carrying further delicacies. \nMEDIUM SHOT -- HEAD OF STAIRCASE \nUp the staircase pants the cigarette girl, followed by two other cigarette girls. Camera pans with them as they rush toward the door of the Royal Suite and enter. From within we HEAR terrific greetings. The CAMERA REMAINS ON THE DOOR as we SLOWLY DISSOLVE INTO EVENING. \nThe electric lights are lit and a band of five Hungarian musicians enters carrying typical Hungarian instruments, including a cimbalom. \nLONG SHOT -- ROYAL SUITE \nThe orchestra is playing; the Three Russians, very high by now, are dancing with the girls. One of them is wearing the cigarette tray of one of the girls. It is a harmless but loud and hilarious party. Apart from all the hullabaloo sits Leon at the desk, a telegraph blank before him. \nLEON Hey, Sascha! Serge! Misha! \nThe three come to him, all in the gayest, most agreeable mood. \nKOPALSKI Yes, Leon... \nIRANOFF (pawing him) What is it, my boy? \nLEON About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you. \nBULJANOFF Leon... Leonitchka... (he embraces Leon) Why are you so good to us? (he kisses Leon) \nIRANOFF (kissing Leon too) Leon, my little boy. \nKOPALSKI (joining them) Oh, Leon, you are so good. \nLEON (freeing himself as best he can) What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade? \n", "test1_id": 1299, "test2_input": "SWANA Yes? \nKOPALSKI We want to talk to Count d'Algout. My name is Kopalski. \nSWANA Oh... you are the three gentlemen from Moscow? \nKOPALSKI Yes. \nSWANA (icily) You may wait. \nShe closes the door. \nSTAIRCASE HALL -- IN FRONT OF LEON'S DOOR \nThe Three Russians, very impressed, stand looking at the door which has just been closed. \nBULJANOFF That's her. \nKOPALSKI Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us. \nBULJANOFF Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face. \nIRANOFF Now look here, Buljanoff. You never were in Petersburg, you never owned a cart, and she never spat in your face. Who are you trying to impress? \nAt this moment the door is opened by Leon in his bathrobe. \nLEON Hello, boys. \nALL THREE RUSSIANS Leon! \nLEON Come in, come in. \nThey enter. \nLIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT \nLeon and the Three Russians enter. \nLEON What's new? \nKOPALSKI (excitedly) Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it! \nIRANOFF She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer. \nLEON (eagerly) What did she say about me? \nIRANOFF (after a moment's consideration) I think she covered you with the parasites. \nLeon is disappointed. \nBULJANOFF And Leonitchka! What she said about us...! \nIRANOFF And they might believe her in Moscow. \nBULJANOFF What do you mean they might -- they will! \nKOPALSKI We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity... \nIRANOFF We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no. \nLeon is so engrossed in his thoughts that he overlooks the hint. \nLEON Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby! \nKOPALSKI She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books! \nLEON All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her! \nKOPALSKI We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon... \nIRANOFF You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we? \nLEON No, no. \nBULJANOFF Didn't we put up a strong resistance? \nLEON Oh, yes, yes. \nKOPALSKI You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia! \nBULJANOFF Or it might be the firing squad! \nKOPALSKI Or we can't go back to Russia! \nAn idea dawns on Iranoff. \nIRANOFF What's wrong with that? \nKopalski and Buljanoff seize on the same idea. \nBULJANOFF Yes! We could stay with Leon! \n", "test2_true": "LEON Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother. \nBULJANOFF Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you. \nSwana's voice comes from the next room. \nSWANA Leon! Just a minute... \nLeon goes back to the other room. \nLEON'S BEDROOM -- CLOSE SHOT, shooting toward the door of the living room. \nSwana stands putting on her gloves. \nSWANA I'm leaving, dear. I'm lunching at Fouquet's if you can make it, and... Leon, remember, a man should think it over twice before he decides to become a mother. \nShe kisses him lightly and walks out. \nLIVING ROOM -- ROYAL SUITE -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- AT THE DESK \nIt is piled deep with law books and papers. Ninotchka sits at it, conferring with two Lawyers. \nFIRST LAWYER (uncertainly) I seem to remember some additional injunctive provision dealing with the property of foreigners residing in France. \nNINOTCHKA (with the precision of a machine) You are referring to paragraph 59b, section 25f of the Civil Code. \nThe Lawyers exchange a glance of surprise at her knowledge. One of them takes up one of the law books and as he starts to look up the case, Ninotchka speaks. \nNINOTCHKA Page eight hundred twenty-four. \nAgain the Lawyers exchange a glance of astonishment. \nNINOTCHKA And do not fail to read the three footnotes. While you are studying it I will eat. (She picks up the telephone) Food please. \nA LITTLE CORNER IN THE ROOM SERVICE PANTRY \nRakonin is answering the telephone. \nRAKONIN (into phone) Room service... Just a moment please. \nHe beckons to someone out of the scene. Leon enters the scene and takes the telephone. \nLEON (with an assumed French accent -- into phone) Room service speaking. \nCLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA -- AT THE PHONE \nNINOTCHKA (into phone) Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people. \nCLOSE SHOT -- ROOM-SERVICE PANTRY -- LEON AT PHONE \nLEON (into phone) So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite! \nHe hangs up the telephone with a triumphant smile. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLOBBY OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE \nNinotchka emerges from the elevator and starts toward the street. As she passes the showcase of the millinery shop again, she stops and looks at the same hat. Again she shakes her head sadly. \nNINOTCHKA Tsk, tsk, tsk. \nShe walks toward the street, as we \nEXTERIOR, HOTEL CLARENCE \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA taxi is parked at the curb. Ninotchka comes from the hotel and goes to the taxi. \nCLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND TAXI DRIVER \nThe Driver puts his hand on the handle of his cab's door expectantly. \nTAXI DRIVER Where to, madame? \nNINOTCHKA Can you recommend a restaurant? \nTAXI DRIVER Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's... \nNINOTCHKA (interrupting) Where do you eat? \nTAXI DRIVER At P\u00e8re Mathieu's. \nNINOTCHKA Where is that? \nTAXI DRIVER It's just a place for workmen. \nNINOTCHKA Where is it? \n", "test2_id": 1300, "test3_input": "NINOTCHKA Where are they? \nSWANA You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with. \nNINOTCHKA Where are they? \nSWANA Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian. (she draws back the fur scarf she is wearing, revealing a diamond star, one of the jewels we have seen) I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police... \nNINOTCHKA You leave me no choice. \nSWANA Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them? \nNINOTCHKA I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them. \nSWANA That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you! \nShe proceeds into the living room, followed by Ninotchka. \nNINOTCHKA They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back! \nSWANA (triumphantly) I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down? \nThey both sit. \nSWANA (very matter-of-fact) Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels. \nNINOTCHKA In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet. \nSWANA Unfortunately. \nNINOTCHKA Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership. \nSWANA My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative. \nNINOTCHKA Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now... \nSWANA I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait. \nNINOTCHKA I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger. \nSWANA No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after. \nNINOTCHKA Go on. \nSWANA I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow. \nNINOTCHKA (quietly) That's not the way to win him back... not Leon. \nSWANA I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova. \nNinotchka knows herself to be faced with an inevitable decision. For a moment she cannot answer. The telephone rings. Ninotchka takes the receiver. \nNINOTCHKA (into telephone) Yes... (it is Leon) Oh hello... \nMuch as she wants to talk to him she hesitates in the presence of Swana. Swana realizes the situation, gets up, and walks over to the window, where she stands looking out. \nCLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA AT TELEPHONE \nNINOTCHKA Good morning, Leon... (forcing herself to be gay so that he will not suspect anything) ... no, you didn't waken me... I am fine, thank you.... Yes, it was... marvelous.... What?... for luncheon? I'm afraid I can't. I am going to be very busy... (looking for excuses) well, I have a lot of things to attend to today.... What?... Well to tell you the truth I am a little tired and I would like to rest... (she forces herself to laugh) you may be right... perhaps it is the champagne.... For dinner?... Of course... seven o'clock here?... (realizing that she will be gone by then) seven o'clock is all right.... Where?... That will be lovely.... Yes... (there is a knock on the door) Come in. (into the telephone) Yes?... (looking toward the door she sees something which makes her stop the conversation) Just a moment... (she puts the receiver on the table and walks toward the door) \nANTEROOM BETWEEN LIVING ROOM AND CORRIDOR, shooting toward the living room. In the background we see Swana standing at the window. Ninotchka comes into the anteroom, closes the door in order to shut off Swana's view. Camera pans with Ninotchka as she walks toward the hall door where the bellboy is putting down a big flower basket. \nNINOTCHKA (to bellboy) You can leave it here. \nThe bellboy exits. Ninotchka looks at the basket of flowers for a moment, then takes the envelope which is attached to the handle. She opens it and reads the enclosed letter. It must be a love note, for her eyes grow wet. She turns to the last page. \nINSERT \n\"...and sweetheart, I have kept my first promise. I sent poor old Gaston to the market this morning and if you will look deep into the flowers you will see what I got for him....\" \nCLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA \nShe puts her hand in the basket and takes out a bottle of milk. \nINSERT OF THE BOTTLE \nOn the label we see a picture of a goat. \nNINOTCHKA \nShe smiles sadly and goes to the telephone, which is on the console in the anteroom. \nNINOTCHKA (into telephone) Operator, will you switch the call please?... Hello?... Darling, your present just arrived.... It's very silly and very wonderful... thank you... No, I won't forget... seven o'clock.... (with great tenderness) Good-by, my darling.... What?... Oh... (softly) salute! \nShe puts down the receiver. Camera pans with her as she goes to the door of the living room. She opens the door and goes in. Swana turns from the window. \nNINOTCHKA I am sorry to have kept you waiting, madame. \nSWANA -- AT THE AIRPORT \nDISSOLVE TO: \n", "test3_true": "ENTRANCE HALL -- SWANA'S APARTMENT \nSwana's maid is opening the door for Swana, who enters in the highest spirits. \nSWANA Good afternoon, Jacqueline. \nMAID Good afternoon, Your Highness. (hesitantly) Madame, I... \nSWANA You didn't find my glove. All right, you're forgiven. \nMAID Thank you, Your Highness. Count d'Algout is waiting. He's been here some time. \nSwana inspects herself briefly in the hall mirror, proceeds into the living room. \nLIVING ROOM -- SWANA'S APARTMENT \nLeon is pacing up and down. Swana enters. \nSWANA Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail? \nLEON No thanks, Swana. \nSWANA Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize? \nLEON I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before. \nSWANA Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession? \nLEON Yes. \nSWANA Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll... \nLEON This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen. \nSWANA All right, I'll listen. \nLEON I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle? \nSWANA Brutal frankness, if you insist. \nLEON There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana. \nSWANA And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so? \nLEON It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana. \nSWANA Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you? \nLEON I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living. \nSWANA Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration. \nLEON I'm afraid that's what it is. \nSWANA The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again. (she glances at her wrist watch) By about five minutes. \nLEON What is this, Swana? \nSWANA Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow. \nLEON Has done what? \nSWANA She's gone, Leon. \nLEON Do you expect me to believe that? \nSwana picks up the receiver of the telephone and holds it out to him. \nSWANA Here's the telephone. If you call the hotel you will find that you have no seven o'clock appointment. \nTHE MOSCOW PLANE \nIt is flying past the Eiffel Tower. \nCLOSE SHOT -- AIRPLANE WINDOW \nBehind the window we see Ninotchka looking at Paris for the last time. Camera moves over to the next window and we see Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski also giving Paris a sad farewell look. \nANOTHER VIEW OF PARIS, from the air. The mist has closed in by now so that only the top of the Eiffel Tower is visible above it. \nCLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA, looking down on the Tower \nINTERIOR, Airplane -- Ninotchka, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski \nNinotchka turns from the window and leans against the back of her chair. The Russians follow her example. There is a moment of silence and sadness. \nBULJANOFF Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower. \nKOPALSKI That's right. \n", "test3_id": 1301}

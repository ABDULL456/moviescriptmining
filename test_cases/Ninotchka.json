{"train": "NINOTCHKA \nWritten by \nCharles Brackett, Billy Wilder & Walter Reisch \nBased on a story by \nMelchior Lengyel \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN ON: \nAN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS IN THE MONTH OF APRIL \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE LUXURIOUS LOBBY OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE \nCAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the desk. In the background is a revolving door leading to the street. Through the revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously one who doesn't belong in such surroundings. It is Comrade Buljanoff, a member of the Russian Board of Trade. Despite the spring climate of Paris, he still wears his typical Russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a fur cap, and heavy boots. \nBuljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over-whelmed by its magnificence. The Manager, puzzled by Buljanoff's strange appearance, approaches him. \nMANAGER (politely) Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur? \nBULJANOFF No, no. \nHe exits toward the street. The Manager returns to his customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around. It is Comrade Iranoff. \nThe Manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him. \nMANAGER Yes, monsieur? \nIRANOFF Just looking around. \nIranoff exits. Again the Manager returns to his duties, when suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. It is Comrade Kopalski. \nKopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. The Manager is by now dumfounded. \nSTREET IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE \nA taxi stands at the curb. Buljanoff and Iranoff are waiting beside it, Iranoff holding a suitcase. Kopalski, returning from the hotel, joins the group. \nKOPALSKI Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful. \nIRANOFF Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia? \nALL THREE (agreeing with him) No, no, no. \nIRANOFF Can you imagine what the beds would be in a hotel like that? \nKOPALSKI They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid. \nIRANOFF (with a gleam in his eye) Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in. \nBULJANOFF (stopping him) Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior. \nIRANOFF Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff? \nKOPALSKI Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath? \nBULJANOFF (stepping back into the taxi) I don't want to go to Siberia. \nIranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly. \nIRANOFF I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus. \nKOPALSKI If Lenin were alive he would say, \"Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times.\" \nIRANOFF He wouldn't say that. What he would say is \"Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!\" \nBULJANOFF (weakening) I still say our place is with the common people, but who am I to contradict Lenin? Let's go in. \nAll three start to leave the taxi, as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE -- AT THE DESK \nBuljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are approaching the Manager, their only suitcase carried by two of them. \nKOPALSKI Are you the manager? \nMANAGER (eyeing the three suspiciously) Yes. \nKOPALSKI Pardon me for introducing Comrade Iranoff, member of the Russian Board of Trade. \nMANAGER (bowing with strained politeness) Monsieur. \nIRANOFF This is Comrade Kopalski. \nSTREET CORNER NEAR THE HOTEL CLARENCE \nWIPE TO: \nRakonin is getting into a taxi. \nRAKONIN (to taxi driver) Eight Rue de Chalon. \nWIPE TO: \nINSERT the House Number \"8\" \nabove the doorway of a Parisian apartment house. Camera pulls back to medium shot of the whole entrance. Into it is striding a typical Parisian playboy. He is Count Leon d'Algout. \nENTRANCE HALL -- SWANA'S APARTMENT \nThe door is being opened by Swana's maid. Leon enters like a man thoroughly at home. \nMAID Good morning, Count. \nLEON Good morning. \nMAID Her Highness is still dressing. \nLEON (as he walks toward Swana's door) That's all right. \nLONG SHOT -- SWANA'S ROOM \nSwana sits at her dressing table in a negligee. Leon enters with the easy air of an old friend. He kisses her lightly. \nSWANA Hello, Leon! \nLEON Good morning, Swana. \nDuring Swana's long speech he sits down, not paying much attention to her patter, lights a cigarette, and glances through a magazine. \nSWANA It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves. \nLEON Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer. \nSWANA Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night? \nLEON Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests. \nSWANA Did you win? \nLEON (enthusiastically) We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me. \nSWANA (with humor) Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. (She kisses him) \nLEON We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night. \nSWANA (contemptuously) Those newspaper people? \nLEON You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots. \nSWANA What a gruesome proof of the power of the press! \nLEON Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. \"The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia\"! \nSWANA (protestingly) Oh, Leon! \nLEON Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past! \nSWANA Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid? \nLEON I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million! \nSWANA Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments! \nLeon knows on which note to play for Swana's benefit. \nLEON Well, I am the last person to persuade you, but don't do it blindly... if this is your decision, you must be prepared to face the consequences... (With the expression of a man ready to give his all) I will have to go to work. \nSwana rises and goes over to Leon. His method has been highly successful. \nSWANA My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this. (Embracing him) Are you my little Volga boatman? \nLEON Now, Swana... \nSWANA First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman? \nLEON (anything to stop her) Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman. \nSWANA (walking back to the dressing table) Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: \"A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard.\" \nLeon sits down next to her, growing enthusiastic. \nLEON I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. \"Caviar and Blood.\" Swana escapes over the ice! \nSWANA A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nspread out on a table in the Royal Suite. Camera pulls back to a LONGER SHOT. We see Mercier, the jeweler, examining the jewels with an eyepiece screwed in his eye. Around him stand the Three Russians. Mercier, a middle-aged man of the greatest suavity and elegance, but a shrewd trader none the less, looks up. \nMERCIER Very good... superb... excellent... it would be foolish to belittle the quality of the merchandise but your terms are impossible. My counteroffer is the absolute maximum. \nKOPALSKI But, Monsieur Mercier... \nMERCIER (continuing) Gentlemen, I'll let you in on a little secret... we are only undertaking this deal for the prestige involved, and, quite frankly, we are expecting to take a loss. \nIranoff draws Buljanoff aside and whispers in his ear. \nIRANOFF (whispering) Capitalistic methods... \nBULJANOFF They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss. \nThe telephone rings. \nBULJANOFF (answering phone) Hello... this is Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski... Who?... Count d'Algout?... No, no... it must be a mistake... we can't be disturbed. \nMERCIER (continuing) I assure you no one else could meet the figure named by my syndicate... at least under the present economic conditions. \nKOPALSKI We can wait. \nIRANOFF (pompously) Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money? \nMERCIER Yes. Gentlemen... let's put our cards face down. Right now there is a Russian commission in New York trying to sell fifteen Rembrandts. There is another in London mortgaging the oil fields in Baku. You need money and you need it quickly. I think my offer is fair and does not even take advantage of your situation. \nCLOSE-UP -- BULJANOFF, IRANOFF, AND KOPALSKI \nKOPALSKI (to Mercier) Just a minute. \nThe Three Russians step to one side. \nIRANOFF (in a low voice) He's cutting our throat... \nBULJANOFF But what can we do?... We have to accept. \nKOPALSKI Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia. \nBULJANOFF All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes. \nSHOT OF THE WHOLE GROUP \nThere is a knock at the door. Iranoff walks toward it, unlocks it, opens it a little. In the door appears Leon. \nIRANOFF We don't want to be disturbed. \nLEON My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned. \nIRANOFF If you want to see us you must come later. \nLEON I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier. \nIRANOFF But you can't... \nLeon pushes his way in. He approaches Monsieur Mercier. The Russians get between him and the jewels and during the following scene put them back into the safe. \nLEON Monsieur Mercier. May I introduce myself? I am Count Leon d'Algout. I think I had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop. I was admiring a platinum watch with diamond numbers. \nMERCIER Oh, yes, yes... \nLEON (glancing at the jewels) Glorious, aren't they? \nKOPALSKI Now, monsieur, you have no right... \nLEON (very charmingly) Just a moment. (to Mercier) I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties. \nALL THREE RUSSIANS Who are you? What do you want? What is this? \nLEON These jewels are the property of the Duchess Swana of Russia, and were seized illegally by the Soviet Government. I am acting for Her Highness, the Duchess. Here is my power of attorney. \nHe hands it to Mercier, who reads it. \nIRANOFF (excitedly) You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense. \nKOPALSKI These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State. \nLEON We'll leave the problem of their ownership to the French courts. Meanwhile I have filed a petition for an injunction to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels. Here is a copy. \nThe Russians take the copy of the injunction, read it flabbergasted. As they do so, Leon turns to Monsieur Mercier. \nLEON I thought it my duty to warn you. I would hate to see you get in any trouble, monsieur. \nMERCIER Thank you. (he turns to the Russians) Gentlemen, this introduces a new element into our negotiations. Until this claim is completely settled... \nKOPALSKI We can call our ambassador. \nIRANOFF I give you my word! They were confiscated legally! \nMERCIER Please try to understand my position. I am not with-drawing. My offer stands and as soon as you produce a clear title, approved by the French courts, the deal is settled. Until then, good day. \nIRANOFF Razinin. \nLEON (writing) Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. \nKOPALSKI You wouldn't like Razinin. \nBULJANOFF He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia! \nIRANOFF We don't like Razinin. \nBULJANOFF (again pawing Leon) We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon? \nThe others join him and kiss Leon. \nIRANOFF AND KOPALSKI Yes, we like Leon... little Leonitchka. \nThis brings on a new frenzy of Russian affection. Leon frees himself and rises. \nLEON How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski. \nKOPALSKI If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia! \nIRANOFF And if we have to go to Siberia... \nLEON (still looking over the telegram) I'll send you a muff. \nBULJANOFF Oh, why are you so good to us? \nIRANOFF AND KOPALSKI Yes, you are so good, Leon. \nAgain they overwhelm Leon with an avalanche of Russian affection. At this moment Rakonin enters with some new bottles of champagne. The Russians immediately leave Leon and direct their affection toward Rakonin, embracing and kissing him. \nALL THREE RUSSIANS Comrade waiter, dear waiteritchka!... Why are you so good to us? You good waiter! \nAfter Rakonin has turned over the champagne to the Russians, Leon takes him aside. \nLEON Take this telegram to the telegraph office at once! \nRAKONIN Yes, monsieur. \nHe leaves the room. \nCLOSE SHOT -- DOOR LEADING TO CORRIDOR OF HOTEL CLARENCE \nRakonin comes out with the telegram. The CAMERA PANS with him as he hurries down the corridor, reading it. The CAMERA NARROWS DOWN on an insert of the telegram as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTELEGRAPH WIRES OVER A WIDE SWEEP OF COUNTRY \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTELEGRAPH WIRES OVER THE ROOFS OF MOSCOW \nPan down past the roof of an official building to a CLOSE SHOT of a window. Behind it stands Razinin, reading the telegram. He is a violent, militant Bolshevik. \nThe telegram fills him with rage. As he crumples it, and stares into space, his expression bodes ill for Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski. \nFADE OUT: \nMEDIUM SHOT -- UPPER CORRIDOR OF HOTEL CLARENCE \nFADE IN: \nshooting toward door of elevator. The elevator comes up and stops, the door opens, and the Three Russians step out. They are very smartly dressed and look like any urbane gentlemen coming from the races. Two of them have racing glasses. As they walk toward the Royal Suite, Lady Lavenham, an elderly English aristocrat, comes out of her room. \nLADY LAVENHAM Good afternoon, messieurs, mes Comrades. \nALL THREE RUSSIANS Good afternoon, Lady Lavenham. \nKOPALSKI And how is Lord Lavenham? \nBULJANOFF ...and little Lady Beatrice? \nLADY LAVENHAM Very well. Did fortune favor you at the races? \nIRANOFF Comme ci, comme ca. \nLADY LAVENHAM I understand... nothing to write home about. \nBULJANOFF (alarmed) Who wants to write home about it? \nLADY LAVENHAM It's just a saying. How about joining us Saturday night for dinner? We're having a few friends. \nKOPALSKI Are we free, Buljanoff? \nBULJANOFF Possibly. \nIRANOFF We'll manage. \nLADY LAVENHAM Then let's say at nine. \nIRANOFF I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff. \nNINOTCHKA I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues. \nThey shake hands. Ninotchka's grip is strong as a man's. \nIRANOFF Comrade Buljanoff... \nNINOTCHKA Comrade. \nIRANOFF Comrade Kopalski... \nNINOTCHKA Comrade. \nIRANOFF What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade. \nKOPALSKI If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers. \nNINOTCHKA (sternly) Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go? \nThe Russians are taken aback. As Ninotchka bends down to lift her two suitcases, Iranoff calls: \nIRANOFF Porter! \nA Porter steps up to them. \nPORTER Here, please... \nNINOTCHKA What do you want? \nPORTER May I have your bags, madame? \nNINOTCHKA Why? \nKOPALSKI He is a porter. He wants to carry them. \nNINOTCHKA (to Porter) Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags? \nPORTER Well... that's my business, madame. \nNINOTCHKA That's no business... that's a social injustice. \nPORTER That depends on the tip. \nKOPALSKI (trying to take Ninotchka's bags) Allow me, Comrade. \nNINOTCHKA No, thank you. \nNinotchka takes both suitcases and walks away with the Three Russians, whose nervousness has increased with every word from the Envoy Extraordinary. \nBULJANOFF How are things in Moscow? \nNINOTCHKA Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians. \nThe hearts of the Three Russians drop to their boots, as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE \nNinotchka, followed by the Russians, comes through the lobby, observing every detail of these unfamiliar surroundings. \nSuddenly she stops. In the showcase of a hat shop in the lobby is displayed a hat of the John-Frederic's type. \nNINOTCHKA What's that? \nKOPALSKI It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat. \nNinotchka shakes her head. \nNINOTCHKA Tsk, tsk, tsk, how can such a civilization survive which permits women to put things like that on their heads. It won't be long now, Comrades. \nShe walks out of the shot toward the elevator, followed by the Three Russians, as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nROYAL SUITE \nNinotchka enters, followed by the Three Russians, who by now are frightened to death. \nBULJANOFF This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it. \nNINOTCHKA (glancing around the tremendous room) Which part of the room is mine? \nIRANOFF You see... it is a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite. \nNinotchka begins to unpack her things and puts her typewriter on the desk. \nNINOTCHKA How much does this cost? \nIRANOFF Two thousand francs. \nCLOSE-UP -- MAP OF PARIS \nin the hands of Ninotchka. The CAMERA ZOOMS down to a CLOSE- UP of the little drawing of the Hotel Clarence on the map. The CAMERA then PANS OVER from the Clarence toward the opposite side of the street, but before we reach the opposite side we see that in the center of the street is a little isle of safety. The CAMERA proceeds PANNING to the opposite side of the square and we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe Real Location Corresponding to That Seen on the Map and seen from the same ANGLE. It is evening, and along the street comes Leon on his way to the hotel. The CAMERA PANS with him as he crosses the street. He reaches the isle of safety and there passes Ninotchka, who has come from the other side. They pass on the little isle without noticing each other. Suddenly we hear the whistle of a traffic policeman and both Ninotchka and Leon have to step back to the little isle. \nCLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND LEON \non the little isle. Wanting some information Ninotchka turns to him -- completely impersonal. \nNINOTCHKA You, please. \nLEON Me? \nNINOTCHKA Yes. Could you give me some information? \nLEON Gladly. \nNINOTCHKA How long do we have to wait here? \nLEON Well -- until the policeman whistles again. \nNINOTCHKA At what intervals does he whistle? \nLEON What? \nNINOTCHKA How many minutes between the first and second whistle? \nLEON That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before. \nNINOTCHKA Have you never been caught in a similar situation? \nLEON Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles. \nNINOTCHKA In other words you don't know. \nLEON No. \nNINOTCHKA Thank you. \nLEON You're welcome. \nNinotchka gets out her map, starts to unfold it. \nLEON Can I help you? \nNINOTCHKA You might hold this for me. \nLEON Love to. \nNINOTCHKA (engrossed in her geography) Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we? \nLEON (bewildered) Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer? \nNINOTCHKA No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower. \nLEON Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view... \nNINOTCHKA I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint. \nLEON Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off. \nNINOTCHKA How long does it take a man to land? \nLEON Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it! (looks at map) Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please. \nHe takes her finger and points to the map with it. \nNINOTCHKA (skeptically) Why do you need my finger? \nLEON Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower. \nNINOTCHKA And where are we? \nLEON (shifting her finger back to the hotel) Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it? \nNINOTCHKA I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt? \nLEON I don't have to but I find it natural. \nNINOTCHKA Suppress it. \nLEON I'll try. \nNinotchka starts to fold her map. \nNINOTCHKA For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale? \nLEON Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is. \nNINOTCHKA Then you don't want me to go there. \nLEON (in a pickle) Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more. \nNINOTCHKA (simply) Then why don't we go? (looking at him) You might be an interesting subject of study. \nLEON I will do my best. \nThey walk toward the elevator as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR, ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT \nIn the foreground stands a console on which is a telephone. \nGaston, Leon's elderly, dignified butler, is answering the phone. \nGASTON (into phone) No... Count d'Algout is still out. Yes, as soon as he returns I'll tell him. Yes... I'll tell him Monsieur Buljanoff. \nHe puts down the receiver as Leon opens the door with his key. Ninotchka and Leon enter. Ninotchka, during the following scene, is studying every detail of the apartment with the eye of a technical expert. \nLEON Good evening, Gaston. \nGASTON Good evening, Monsieur. \nNINOTCHKA Is this what you call the \"butler\"? \nLEON Yes. \nNINOTCHKA (takes Gaston's hand) Good evening, comrade. (to Leon) This man is horribly old. You should not make him work. \nLEON He takes good care of that. \nNINOTCHKA He looks sad. Do you whip him? \nLEON No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water. \nNINOTCHKA (to the completely flabbergasted Gaston) The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone. \nLeon opens the door to the living room. Ninotchka enters. Just as he is about to follow her, Gaston addresses him. \nGASTON (in a low voice) Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone... \nLEON Go to bed. \nINTERIOR, LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT \nLeon enters the room. Closes the door. Ninotchka is examining the room. \nLEON Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat? \nNINOTCHKA Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today. \nLeon feels a little uncertain as to how to approach this creature. \nNINOTCHKA What do we do now? \nLEON We take off our hat and coat. (he takes her things) We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile. (Ninotchka doesn't respond) Well... we don't smile. How about some music? \nNINOTCHKA Is that customary? \nLEON It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio. \nNINOTCHKA (the observer) I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five. \nLEON Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin? \nNINOTCHKA I will start with you. \nLEON That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped. \nNINOTCHKA And what is your profession? \nLEON Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job. \nNINOTCHKA And what do you do for mankind? \nLEON For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak. \nNINOTCHKA You are something we do not have in Russia. \nLEON Thank you. Thank you. \nNINOTCHKA That is why I believe in the future of my country. \nLEON I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka. \nNINOTCHKA You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka. \nLEON Ni-notchka. \nLEON (continuing) Glorious, analytical... \nNINOTCHKA The telephone is ringing. \nLEON Oh, let it ring. \nNINOTCHKA But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer. \nLeon exits out of shot to answer telephone. \nCLOSE SHOT -- AT DESK \nLeon enters, sits down, takes the telephone. \nLEON (into phone) Hello?... Yes... I'm sorry but I couldn't make it. I ran into a friend from the army... What?... The deal is off! Are you crazy, Buljanoff?... \nCLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA \nShe is startled by the name. \nLEON -- AT TELEPHONE \nLEON ...A special envoy arrived... What?... That sounds better. I'll be glad to see her any time she wants... Oh, she doesn't want to see me? What do you know about that? Why?... Well, I'll get in touch with her myself. What's her name?... (he takes a pencil and a piece of paper) ...What?... Yaku... How do you spell it?... Heavens! those Russian names! (he starts to write it down) ...I... Oh, Y... \nCamera pulls back and Ninotchka enters the shot. She takes pencil from Leon's hand, writes out the name, and leaves again. At first Leon is not aware of the full significance of her action. Then it dawns on him. \nLEON (continuing) Yakushova... Ninotch... \nAt last the situation is entirely clear to him. \nLEON (into phone) All right. Thank you. \nHe hangs up and stares at Ninotchka. She is putting on her jacket. \nLEON (camera panning with him as he walks over to her) Ninotchka... \nHe takes her arm. \nNINOTCHKA I must go. \nLEON Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova... \nNINOTCHKA Let's forget that we ever met. \nLEON I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka... \nNINOTCHKA (firmly) I was sent here by my country to fight you. \nLEON All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy. \nNINOTCHKA (uncompromisingly) As a representative of Moscow... \nLEON Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves. \nNINOTCHKA It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me... \nLEON You know I want to... \nNINOTCHKA Then do it through my lawyer! \nLEON (desperate) Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye. \nNinotchka looks at him for a second, then pulls herself together. \nNINOTCHKA I must go. \nShe starts for the door. \nLEON But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me! \nNINOTCHKA I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died. \nAs she goes out, we \nFADE OUT: \nTHE ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT \nFADE IN: \n(Note: We have to invent some brief scene to indicate that three days have gone by. From this we) \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe butler opens the door. Swana enters, her manner showing her complete familiarity with the place. \nGASTON Good morning, Your Highness. \nSWANA Good morning, Gaston. \nGASTON Count d'Algout is still asleep. \nSWANA Yes? \nKOPALSKI We want to talk to Count d'Algout. My name is Kopalski. \nSWANA Oh... you are the three gentlemen from Moscow? \nKOPALSKI Yes. \nSWANA (icily) You may wait. \nShe closes the door. \nSTAIRCASE HALL -- IN FRONT OF LEON'S DOOR \nThe Three Russians, very impressed, stand looking at the door which has just been closed. \nBULJANOFF That's her. \nKOPALSKI Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us. \nBULJANOFF Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face. \nIRANOFF Now look here, Buljanoff. You never were in Petersburg, you never owned a cart, and she never spat in your face. Who are you trying to impress? \nAt this moment the door is opened by Leon in his bathrobe. \nLEON Hello, boys. \nALL THREE RUSSIANS Leon! \nLEON Come in, come in. \nThey enter. \nLIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT \nLeon and the Three Russians enter. \nLEON What's new? \nKOPALSKI (excitedly) Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it! \nIRANOFF She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer. \nLEON (eagerly) What did she say about me? \nIRANOFF (after a moment's consideration) I think she covered you with the parasites. \nLeon is disappointed. \nBULJANOFF And Leonitchka! What she said about us...! \nIRANOFF And they might believe her in Moscow. \nBULJANOFF What do you mean they might -- they will! \nKOPALSKI We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity... \nIRANOFF We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no. \nLeon is so engrossed in his thoughts that he overlooks the hint. \nLEON Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby! \nKOPALSKI She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books! \nLEON All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her! \nKOPALSKI We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon... \nIRANOFF You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we? \nLEON No, no. \nBULJANOFF Didn't we put up a strong resistance? \nLEON Oh, yes, yes. \nKOPALSKI You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia! \nBULJANOFF Or it might be the firing squad! \nKOPALSKI Or we can't go back to Russia! \nAn idea dawns on Iranoff. \nIRANOFF What's wrong with that? \nKopalski and Buljanoff seize on the same idea. \nBULJANOFF Yes! We could stay with Leon! \nGROUP OF SEVERAL WORKMEN \nThey have overheard the story and all burst into laughter. \nNINOTCHKA AND LEON \nNinotchka continues to eat her soup without a shadow of a laugh. \nLEON (furious) Not funny, huh? \nNINOTCHKA No. \nLEON So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it. \nHe sits down again. \nLEON (threateningly) I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that? \nNINOTCHKA Yes. \nLEON He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too? \nNINOTCHKA Yes. \nLEON Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, \"Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee.\" So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, \"I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee.\"... (he realizes he has made a mistake) Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up... (he starts over again) A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, \"Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream,\" and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, \"I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!\" \nHe gets up and goes over to his table furiously. \nLEON Ah! You have no sense of humor! That settles it! You have no sense of humor! None! No humor!! \nIn his excitement he leans on the shaky table. It topples forward. Simultaneously his feet shoot from under him and he sits violently on the floor, the contents of the table crashing about him, hot soup in his face. \nA terrific roar of laughter arises; the whole restaurant is rocking with laughter. \nFor a split second Ninotchka makes an effort to control the irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself roars with laughter. \nLEON (indignantly) What's funny about this? \nNinotchka's laughter is uncontrollable. \nAfter a moment Leon gets up and sits next to her. As he dries himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation and starts to howl with laughter too. The ice is broken at last! \nOn their mutual wild hilarity, we \nFADE OUT: \nLIVING ROOM -- ROYAL SUITE \nFADE IN: \nA conference is in session -- Ninotchka, her two Lawyers, and the Three Russians. Ninotchka sits at the desk, leaning back in the chair, looking into space, and apparently weighing every point which is brought up. One of the lawyers is reading from a document. \nLAWYER (reading) In addition to the arguments above enumerated for lifting this injunction, we wish to cite the decision of the High Court of Paris, rendered in the case of Princess Marishka against the Government of Montenegro on the fifth day of August, 1897. Comparing the facts in that case with our present set of facts we feel that the Treaty between the Republic of France and the U.S.S.R. should prevail over all... \nSuddenly Ninotchka laughs. Everyone looks at her astonished. Ninotchka gets up. \nNINOTCHKA I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story... (she laughs again) It still makes me laugh. It is very funny. (a little embarrassed) I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction... \nLAWYER (very businesslike) The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month. \nNINOTCHKA (not thinking of the injunction) That's two weeks from Thursday... \nLAWYER We did our utmost to have it set ahead. \nNINOTCHKA (her attitude completely different from her former business conferences) I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we? \nLAWYER Yes. It is unfortunate. \nNINOTCHKA Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited? \nThe Three Russians as well as the Lawyers are puzzled. \nThe Russians exchange hopeful glances. \nLAWYER We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame. \nNINOTCHKA Au revoir. \nThe Lawyers leave. \nLeft alone with the Russians, Ninotchka is unable to conceal her happiness entirely. \nNINOTCHKA Well, it means another two weeks in Paris. \nIRANOFF (with exaggerated efficiency) Too bad we have to waste all that time. \nKOPALSKI I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you. \nNINOTCHKA (a little bit dreamily) Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you. \nBULJANOFF There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive. \nLEON You see? Life can be so simple. \nNINOTCHKA For twelve francs, seventy-five. \nLEON Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!... (charmingly) But he got you here. \nAt this moment the clock starts to strike. They both look toward it. \nINSERT -- CLOCK \nThe hands register nine o'clock. \nLEON AND NINOTCHKA \nLeon wants to take her in his arms. She resists a little. \nNINOTCHKA (reprimanding him) It's nine o'clock. \nLEON That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, \"What are your plans for this evening, madame?\" \nNINOTCHKA (getting more and more in the spirit of her change of appearance) Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket. (Leon takes them) Then could we have some music? \nLEON A wonderful idea! Radio or records? \nNINOTCHKA Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves. \nLeon turns on the victrola. \nLEON (with great feeling and sincerity) I'll play it softly because I have things to tell you about which I can't shout. \nHe walks back to Ninotchka, who by now is seated in an armchair. He sits on the arm of the chair. He tries to make a declaration of his love. He stammers several words. \nLEON Well, my darling... I... we... \nIt is no use. In a sudden outburst of emotion he takes her in his arms and kisses her. \nLEON (as they come out of the kiss) You see I couldn't shout that. \nNINOTCHKA (with great feeling) Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative? \nLEON (radiantly) No... go on. \nNINOTCHKA Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it... \nThey kiss again. As the kiss ends they look at each other for a second. \nNinotchka gets up and goes toward the desk, sits in the desk chair, opens her handbag, which lies there, and takes from it a little mirror and a lipstick. Before she uses it she looks at Leon with guilty happiness. Leon looks at her with great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking at her as she makes up her lips. \nLEON What a gesture for a sergeant. \nAs soon as she is finished, Ninotchka slips the mirror and lipstick back into her handbag and, as she does so, glances at the top of the desk. \nNINOTCHKA Leon, I would like to ask you something. \nLEON Anything, Ninotchka. \nNINOTCHKA If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth. \nLEON I promise... I swear. \nNINOTCHKA (seriously) Did you make any change in this room? \nLEON I don't think so. \nNINOTCHKA When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman? \nLeon too is completely serious by now. For answer he quietly opens the drawer of the desk. Ninotchka looks in and takes from the drawer the photograph. As she looks at it she rises. \nNINOTCHKA The Duchess. \nLeon nods gravely. \nNINOTCHKA (looking at the picture) She is very attractive. She has great elegance. (she looks back at Leon) She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she? \nLEON (after a little pause) Ninotchka, I love you. \nNINOTCHKA I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous... \nLEON Ninotchka, you're jealous. \nNinotchka nods sadly. \nNINOTCHKA (with great feeling) Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it. \nLEON My darling. \nAs he takes her in his arms, we \nFADE OUT: \nINTERIOR, SMART NIGHT CLUB \nANOTHER GUEST How could you make such a remark? \nTHIRD GUEST Swana isn't stupid. \nMARIANNE What did I say? I just said \"isn't she something?\" I didn't say something what. \nCLOSE SHOT -- LEON'S TABLE \nLeon and Ninotchka are seated and a Waiter stands by them presenting a bottle of champagne to Leon for his approval. \nLEON (to Waiter) Is it dry? \nWAITER Yes, monsieur. \nLEON (to Ninotchka) Is that right or do you prefer it sweet? \nNINOTCHKA I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship. \nLEON It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening. \nBy now the Waiter is filling their glasses. Ninotchka lifts her glass and looks at it. \nNINOTCHKA It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne. \nLEON (gaily) From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction. \nNinotchka takes her first sip of champagne. Leon drinks and watches her. The first sip proves a painful surprise. Ninotchka's face is that of a child who has been fed a bad medicine. \nNINOTCHKA Ugh... um... oh... (slowly the delight of champagne dawns on her and her face breaks into a smile) It's good. \nShe drinks the whole glass at once. Leon looks at her in amused surprise. He drinks too. The Waiter fills their glasses again. \nNINOTCHKA From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this? \nLEON There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast. (he raises his glass again fondly) To us, Ninotchka! \nThey clink glasses and drink again, looking at each other. \nLONG SHOT OF THE TABLE, including part of the dance floor. \nAs Leon and Ninotchka lift their glasses again, Swana and General Savitzky start to dance by the table. Swana stops, pretending complete astonishment. \nSWANA Hello, Leon! What a surprise! You of all people! How are you, my dear? \nLeon gets up. Ninotchka watches the scene tensely. \nLEON (embarrassed) Hello, Swana. How do you do, General Savitzky? \nGENERAL SAVITZKY How do you do? \nSWANA (to Leon) You're looking magnificent, Leon... (to General Savitzky) ...isn't he, General Savitzky? \nGENERAL SAVITZKY Yes. \nLeon knows that Swana wants to embarrass him but is embarrassed nevertheless. \nLEON Thank you. \nSWANA Is this your new dress suit? \nLEON Yes, Swana. \nSWANA Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you? \nLEON (patiently) Yes, Swana, you did. \nSWANA It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I? \nLEON Yes, Swana. \nSWANA (forcing an introduction) Am I interrupting? \nLEON Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova? \nSWANA How do you do? \nNINOTCHKA How do you do? \nLEON And General Savitzky. \nGENERAL SAVITZKY How do you do? \nNINOTCHKA How do you do? \nSWANA I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down? \nLEON (realizing that he cannot prevent it) No... please... \nSwana sits down. \nSWANA (to General Savitzky) General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments. \nNINOTCHKA Thursday. \nLEON Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right. \nIn the gayest mood, Ninotchka addresses the crowd on the dance floor. \nNINOTCHKA Comrades! Comrades! \nLEON (embarrassed) Darling, darling... please! \nNINOTCHKA I must talk to my brothers! \nLEON Shhh! Shhh! \nNINOTCHKA Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess! \nLeon starts to lead her off the dance floor. \nLEON But, darling, you can't do that. \nNINOTCHKA Comrades! Good people of France! \nLEON Now, Ninotchka... please! \nNINOTCHKA They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them. \nBy now they have almost reached the powder room. \nLEON Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down. \nNINOTCHKA (sweetly) No speech? \nLEON (as though he were addressing a little child) No speech. \nNINOTCHKA I love you, my little Leonitchka! \nLEON And I adore you, Ninotchua. \nNinotchka goes unsteadily into the powder room. Leon wipes his forehead in relief and goes to the bar, followed by the CAMERA. \nLEON (to the bartender) Give me a double brandy. \nCLOSE SHOT -- DOOR OF THE POWDER ROOM \nA group of four to six women come out whispering excitedly about something which must have happened within. \nCAMERA goes with them as they go to the Manager of the restaurant and crowd about him and whisper what has happened. \nCLOSE SHOT -- BAR \nThe bartender gives Leon his double brandy and Leon tosses it off. The Manager comes into the shot and addresses Leon. \nMANAGER (very excitedly) I'm very sorry, Count d'Algout, it is most embarrassing, but the lady you brought with you tonight is spreading communistic propaganda in the powder room. \nLeon stares at him for a second, then turns to the bartender. \nLEON Give me another double brandy. \nMANAGER That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous. \nLEON What can I do about it? \nMANAGER She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself. \nLEON (horrified) You want me to go in there? \nMANAGER I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist. \nThe Manager bows and walks away. Leon gulps down the second double brandy. The CAMERA follows him as he proceeds toward the powder room like a hero going into battle. Just as he is about to enter, a very dignified elderly lady comes out, is surprised at his attempted entrance, and glares at him. Leon loses his courage and FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA goes back to the bar to strengthen it with some of the Dutch variety. \nLEON (completely exhausted -- to the bartender) Make it a triple brandy. As we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLIVING ROOM -- THE ROYAL SUITE \nRakonin, the waiter, opens the door. Ninotchka and Leon, both very tipsy by now, enter the room. Leon is carrying a bottle of champagne in a napkin. As he passes the waiter he speaks: \nLEON (to Rakonin) All right... you can tell the Duchess... you can tell everybody... they know anyhow... it doesn't make any difference... now get out! \nRakonin, who seems very interested in the situation, closes the door. \nLeon goes to Ninotchka. Both sit on a couch. \nNINOTCHKA (moving close to him) Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart. \nLEON No. Nobody will find us. \nNinotchka is lyrically tight. Through her there shines a great happiness. \nNINOTCHKA Are we going to build our little house? \nLEON (helpfully) But I can throw it out of the window. \nNINOTCHKA (philosophically) It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street. (she pushes back the lid) There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels.... \nLEON ...but big. \nNINOTCHKA ...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone? \nLEON Who cried that one? \nNINOTCHKA Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market. \nLEON Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, \"Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!\" \nFrom the case of jewels he takes a beautiful diadem and holds it in front of her. \nNINOTCHKA (the economist now) First ten thousand serfs... now just Gaston. It is very encouraging. \nLeon takes her by the hand and leads her from the safe. \nLEON Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look. \nNINOTCHKA They belong to the people. \nLEON (in a ceremonial voice) I give them back to the people... (as formal and steady as possible under the conditions he puts the diadem on her head) I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People! \nNinotchka falls in with the spirit of this imaginary coronation. \nNINOTCHKA Is this the wish of the masses? \nLEON It is their wish. \nNINOTCHKA Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. (in a low voice) Can I make a speech now? \nLEON Please. \nNinotchka turns to an imaginary assemblage. \nNINOTCHKA Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry? (mixing reality with fantasy) Let us be happy... give us our moment.... (turning to Leon) We are happy, aren't we, Leon? \nLEON (fondly) Yes, sweetheart. (he holds her in his arms) \nNINOTCHKA (her voice getting dimmer and dimmer) So happy and so tired. \nShe falls asleep in his arms. Leon gathers her up and carries her into the bedroom, the diadem still on her head. \nBEDROOM -- THE ROYAL SUITE \nLeon carries Ninotchka to the bed, puts her down on it. She is now sleeping soundly. He kisses her once more and then turns, the CAMERA PANNING with him, and starts toward the door to the corridor and exits. As he closes the door with an uncertain hand, it slams. \nCLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, as she lies on the bed \nOn the night table beside her is a photograph of the stern- faced Lenin. The crash of the slamming door awakens Ninotchka for a moment. Completely content and happy, she turns around and sees the disapproving face of the photograph. \nNINOTCHKA (charmingly) Smile, little father, smile. \nINSERT OF PHOTOGRAPH OF LENIN \nThe photograph of Lenin starts to smile in approval, as we... \nFADE OUT: \nAN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS -- DAY \nFADE IN ON: \nIN THE FOREGROUND a clock shows that it is a quarter to twelve. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLONG SHOT -- LIVING ROOM OF THE ROYAL SUITE \nIt is taken from an ANGLE which includes the door. The lights are still on, the curtains drawn, the empty champagne bottle and glasses litter the room. We hear the buzzer of the corridor door ring several times without an answer. \nCAMERA moves through the door into the bedroom, never disclosing the bed. The lights in the bedroom are still lighted also and the curtains drawn. CAMERA stops on the door from the bedroom to the corridor. The buzzer rings. Apparently the caller has moved from the living-room door to the bedroom door. \nCLOSE SHOT OF THE BED \nNinotchka is lying on the bed, still in her evening dress. The diadem is no longer on her head, but no special emphasis is laid on that detail in the camera angle. We hear the sound of the buzzer ringing again and again. Ninotchka half wakens and calls out something which sounds like \"come in\" without being fully aware of what she is doing. \nBEDROOM -- AT THE DOOR \nThe door is opened from the outside by a maid, who lets in the Duchess Swana, dressed in a smart morning outfit. Swana looks around, surprised and amused at the state of the room. She walks over to the bed where lies Ninotchka, still not enough awake to face reality. Swana is delighted to have surprised Ninotchka in this condition. \nSWANA (ironically) Good morning. \nNINOTCHKA (awakening gradually) What? \nSWANA It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana. \nBy now Ninotchka is awake. She gets up and realizes to her acute embarrassment the condition in which Swana has found her. \nIRANOFF They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor. \nKOPALSKI While you eat, you look at the view. \nCLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA \nShe is trying to overcome all sentimentality, but as the following speech progresses she cannot escape the personal implication involved. \nNINOTCHKA Yes, it is an amazing piece of engineering. Still the most remarkable iron structure in the world. Leading to the top there is a staircase of over a thousand steps... but an elevator is included in the price of admission. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINSERT OF A PARIS NEWSPAPER \nHERALD DU MATIN \nCamera zooms down on a headline of an article. \nMercier buys priceless russian jewels. Russian commission has left for moscow. \nSTREET IN PARIS -- MORNING \nCamera follows Leon as he walks excitedly and nervously along the boulevard. He turns into a Russian Intouriste Bureau, one of the travel bureaus maintained by the Soviet government in foreign countries to supply information regarding travel, give visas, etc. \nINTOURISTE BUREAU \nIt is a typical travel bureau. Behind the counter are attendants and some people getting information and pamphlets. Leon enters, looks around, and sees a door which says \"Visas and Passport Department.\" He enters. \nINTERIOR, VISA ROOM \nIt is a room smaller than the previous one. Behind the counter stands a typical Bolshevik Official. In front of the counter is an elderly English lady. Leon takes his place behind her, nervous at having to wait. The Official stamps the English lady's passport and hands it to her. \nOFFICIAL Well, everything is in order. I hope you will enjoy your trip to Russia, madame. \nENGLISH LADY Thank you. Oh, by the way, I've heard so many rumors about laundry conditions in Russia. Is it advisable to take one's own towels? \nOFFICIAL Certainly not, madame. That's only capitalistic propaganda. We change the towel every week. \nENGLISH LADY Oh... thank you. \nShe leaves. Leon moves up to the Official. \nOFFICIAL Yes, please? \nAt this moment the telephone rings. The Official takes the receiver. \nOFFICIAL (into phone) Yes... Comrade Cazabine? No, I'm sorry... he hasn't been with us for six months. He was called back to Russia and was investigated. You can get further details from his widow. \nHe hangs up the receiver. Leon, thinking of Ninotchka, is horrified by this statement. \nLEON Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way? \nOFFICIAL Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. (he knocks on wood) \nLEON (his alarm growing) Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately. \nOFFICIAL (reading passport) Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman! \nLEON Don't hold that against me... please! \nOFFICIAL Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia? \nLEON Business. \nOFFICIAL What business? \nLEON Private. \nOFFICIAL There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess! \nLEON (dismayed) Confess what? \nOFFICIAL Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians? \nLEON On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them. \nOFFICIAL You believe in our cause? \nLeon, feeling that he has to go to the rescue of his girl, whips up an enormous enthusiasm for the cause. \nLEON Oh... I think it's great! Everyone works -- everyone contributes -- that's what I want to do -- work! I make my own bed -- you can call up my butler! I don't believe in the right of the individual. I like the Bolshevik ideal -- everyone being the same. You just like me -- me just like you -- I use your comb -- you use my toothbrush -- oh, it's a great life.... Please... give me that visa! \nAt this moment Swana enters. \nSWANA Hello, Leon darling! \nLEON (startled) Hello. \nSWANA (suavely) After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you. (to the Official) May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia. \nNINOTCHKA Now let's forget everything except that we're together. \nBULJANOFF That's right. \nIRANOFF Let's do that. \nKOPALSKI (falling in with her attempt) It's a real Paris reunion. \nIRANOFF If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris. \nNINOTCHKA Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too. \nBULJANOFF (cynically) I think I need my glasses. \nKOPALSKI (reprimanding him quietly) A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us. \nBULJANOFF (in a loud voice, trying to make up for his faux pas) How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka. \nIRANOFF What a lovely room you have here. \nBULJANOFF How many families live here with you? \nNINOTCHKA Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor. \nIRANOFF (impressed) Just three people in a room this size? Whew! \nKOPALSKI (inspecting the room) And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous! (forgetting himself) Naturally it's not the Royal Suite... \nNINOTCHKA Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow! \nKOPALSKI (walking over to the window) Yes, there's no doubt of that... (sarcastically) Just look out of the window and there it is. \nNINOTCHKA And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now. \nIranoff and Buljanoff have joined them at the window. \nIRANOFF She's right... (under his breath) anyhow let's talk ourselves into it. \nBULJANOFF Just see how happy the people look... from here.... \nKOPALSKI Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over. \nBULJANOFF That's another thing... it's spring. \nNINOTCHKA The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good. \nKOPALSKI Even the swallows are back. \nBULJANOFF AND IRANOFF Yes, that's right. \nIRANOFF Maybe that's the same swallow we saw in Paris! \nBULJANOFF It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it. \nKOPALSKI If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason. \nBULJANOFF I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf\u00e9 de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill. \nNINOTCHKA Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry. \nKOPALSKI (the realist) Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel.... \nNINOTCHKA We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too. \nBULJANOFF (consolingly) And if it is too late for you your children will eat it. \nIRANOFF (breaking the mood) Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet. \nKOPALSKI That's right. (he takes a little box out of his pocket) Here's my egg. (he hands it to Ninotchka) \nIranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief. \nIRANOFF And here's mine. \nHe hands it to Ninotchka. \nBuljanoff reaches in his pocket and from his expression we see that a catastrophe must have happened. \nBULJANOFF Comrades... I'm out of the omelet. \nNINOTCHKA Don't worry... there will be enough. \nIRANOFF Come, Ninotchka, let's make it in real Parisian style! \nThe group all go to the gas cooker and Ninotchka starts to make the omelet. The others stand around as though they were watching a great event. \nKOPALSKI Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes... \nBULJANOFF ...des raisins de Mad\u00e8re, des framboises... (...with grapes of Madeira, with raspberries...) \nIRANOFF ...des petites fraises des bois... de la cr\u00e8me de Bretagne... (...with small wild strawberries... with cream...) \nThe three start to leave but Buljanoff returns and whispers to Ninotchka. \nBULJANOFF They can't censor our memories, can they? \nNinotchka presses his hand. He walks quietly out with the others. \nNinotchka, left alone, sits down. She is heartbroken. Her thoughts are too sad and too far away to be disturbed by the snoring which comes from the corner where the street-car conductor has gone to bed. \nFADE OUT: \nCLOSE SHOT -- THE WINDOW OF RAZININ'S OFFICE \nFADE IN: \nshooting from the inside. Through the window the background of Moscow. It is winter and snow is on the roofs. The CAMERA PULLS BACK and discloses Razinin sitting at his desk, reading a report with a stern expression. \nMEDIUM SHOT -- RAZININ'S OFFICE \nNinotchka enters carrying several folders. She walks to Razinin's desk and stands waiting for him to recognize her presence. She is a tired, stern girl. Razinin looks up. \nRAZININ Good morning, Comrade. \nNINOTCHKA (very businesslike) Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months. \nRAZININ Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces? \nNINOTCHKA Yes, it does. \nRAZININ You mean you have finished the whole investigation? \nNINOTCHKA Yes. \nRAZININ That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep? \nNINOTCHKA I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs. \nRAZININ Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else. \nNINOTCHKA (startled) May I ask why? \nRAZININ Please... sit down. \nNinotchka sits. \nRAZININ Cigarette? \nNINOTCHKA Thank you. \nRAZININ Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff? \nNINOTCHKA No. \nRAZININ I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal. \nNINOTCHKA May I ask what has happened? \nRAZININ As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur. (he points to the folder) This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every caf\u00e9 and night club. Here... (he reads from the report) \"How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?\" \nNinotchka has to suppress a smile of amusement at the antics of her three old friends. \nNINOTCHKA Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct? \nRAZININ It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you. \nNINOTCHKA (apprehensively) You want me to go to Constantinople? \nRAZININ Yes... leaving immediately. \nNINOTCHKA (her one object to escape the mission) I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne. \nRAZININ (austerely) That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova. \nNINOTCHKA I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me. \nRAZININ I don't understand. \nNINOTCHKA (making a last effort) How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go. \nRAZININ Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by. \nNINOTCHKA I will do my best. \nShe exits, as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF CONSTANTINOPLE, on a bright sunlit day, if possible with the circling shadow of an airplane. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLONG SHOT -- AIRPORT IN CONSTANTINOPLE, shooting from an airplane angle. A crowd is awaiting the arrival of a plane. The CAMERA goes down to a CLOSE SHOT of Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, standing in the crowd. \n", "test1_input": "TAXI DRIVER Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel. \nHe opens the door of his cab. \nNINOTCHKA Thank you. \nShe turns and starts away in the direction he has indicated. The Driver looks after her astounded. \nThe CAMERA PANS from her to the car which stands behind the taxi. It is Leon's smart roadster. Leon sits at the wheel. He too is looking after Ninotchka, astonished. He gets out of his car and starts in the direction she has taken. As he does so, we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPARIS STREET -- IN FRONT OF P\u00c8RE MATHIEU'S \nP\u00e8re Mathieu's is a workman's restaurant set a few steps below the level of the sidewalk. A few typical French workmen are going in for lunch. Ninotchka enters the scene, looks around for a second, then goes in too. \nINTERIOR -- P\u00c8RE MATHIEU'S \nIt is a pleasantly simple place crowded with workmen sitting at lunch. An electric piano is playing. P\u00e8re Mathieu, greeting all his guests like a typical restaurateur, sees Ninotchka enter. \nP\u00c8RE MATHIEU This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps? (He leads the way) Or a nice little corner table? \nNINOTCHKA This will do. (She sits down) \nP\u00c8RE MATHIEU I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be? \nNINOTCHKA Raw carrots and beets. \nP\u00c8RE MATHIEU (horrified) Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow. \nHe hands her a slate on which the menu is written. \nP\u00c8RE MATHIEU Here is what we are offering today. Please make your choice. I am sure you will find something to tempt your appetite. \nSuddenly Ninotchka stares in the direction of the door. \nMEDIUM SHOT -- AT THE DOOR \nLeon has just entered. The CAMERA follows him as he makes his way casually in Ninotchka's direction affecting not to see her. He seats himself at the table directly opposite Ninotchka and pretends to be overwhelmed with surprise as he sees her. \nLEON Why, hello! It certainly is a small world! \nSHOT INCLUDING BOTH TABLES \nP\u00c8RE MATHIEU (to Ninotchka) Well, madame? Shall we start with soup? Fish soup today. I got up at five to fish them from the Seine. \nLEON (calling over to P\u00e8re Mathieu) Crayfish soup for me! \nP\u00c8RE MATHIEU (to Leon) Very well, monsieur. (back to Ninotchka) Then, may I suggest an omelet with mushrooms? \nNINOTCHKA Bring me something simple. I never think about food. \nP\u00c8RE MATHIEU (horrified) But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about? \nNINOTCHKA The future of the common people. \nP\u00c8RE MATHIEU (sagely) That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch \u00e0 la P\u00e8re Mathieu. (he exits) \nLeon leans toward Ninotchka with mock humility. \nLEON Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how? (He changes to the chair at his table which is closest to her table) By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life! \nNINOTCHKA I don't like your following me. \nLEON I didn't follow you. \nNINOTCHKA Then how did you get here? \nLEON I always eat here. \nNINOTCHKA This is a place for workmen. \nLEON (laying it on thick) But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah? \nHe waves off scene to a truckman. \nTRUCKMAN \nHe is in the middle of an enormous gulp of food. He registers surprise, winks at his companion, and then, deciding to humor a drunk, waves back energetically at Leon in greeting. \nCUT BACK TO: \nCLOSE SHOT -- LEON AND NINOTCHKA \nLeon has been so successful with the truckman he tries it on another. \nLEON Hyah! \nAnother truckman responds with equal exuberance. \nLONG SHOT -- RESTAURANT \n", "test1_true": "LEON Hyah, fellows! \nHe gets a wonderful response from all. They realize that a swell drunk is among them. \nLEON AND NINOTCHKA \nLEON (boastfully) They are all my friends. They're a swell bunch! \nP\u00e8re Mathieu enters the shot and serves a plate of soup to Leon and one to Ninotchka. \nLEON (trying his bluff on P\u00e8re Mathieu) Ah, my friend! I'm happy to see you again! \nP\u00c8RE MATHIEU I'm always glad to meet a new customer, and I hope this first visit will not be your last. \nHe exits out of shot. \nNinotchka, her suspicion confirmed, looks at Leon. \nLEON Just an old man. His memory is getting weak. \nNINOTCHKA What are you after? \nLEON Must one always be after something? \nNINOTCHKA Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski. \nLEON Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice. (He moves over to her table, leaving the soup at his table) When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal? \nNINOTCHKA But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death. \nLEON Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile! \nNINOTCHKA (astonished) What? \nLEON Will you smile? \nNINOTCHKA Why? \nLEON Just smile. \nNINOTCHKA At what? \nLEON At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me. \nNINOTCHKA Why? \nLEON Because we are an odd couple. \nNINOTCHKA Then you should go back to your table. \nLEON No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once. \nTo get rid of him Ninotchka emits a joyless sound which approximates a laugh. \nNINOTCHKA Ha! Ha! Now go back. \nLEON That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America... \nNINOTCHKA On which boat? \nLEON (thrown off by her methodical thinking) Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one. \nNINOTCHKA Probably not. \nLEON Do you like Scotch stories? \nNINOTCHKA I have never heard one. \nLEON Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, \"Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy,\" and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, \"Hello, Mr. McIntosh,\" and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, \"How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?\" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, \"How is Mrs. McIntosh?\"... \nNINOTCHKA I wish they had never met. \nLEON (disarmed) So do I. (after a little pause) Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha! (he looks at Ninotchka and her expression stops him) Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, \"Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?\" \"Yes, it is,\" says the other, \"five hundred million.\" \"Whew!\" replies the first, \"they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!\" Ha! Ha! Ha! \nThere is no response from Ninotchka. \nLEON (starting to get sore) I suppose you don't think that's funny? \nNINOTCHKA No. \nLEON It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you! \nNINOTCHKA I don't think so. \nLEON Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen! \nHe gets up and speaks in a threatening voice audible to the entire room. \nLEON When I heard this joke for the first time I laughed myself sick. Here goes! A man comes into a restaurant and sits down and says, \"Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream.\" After five minutes the waiter comes back and says, \"I'm sorry, sir, we're all out of cream, can it be without milk?\" \n", "test1_id": 1299, "test2_input": "NINOTCHKA Where are they? \nSWANA You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with. \nNINOTCHKA Where are they? \nSWANA Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian. (she draws back the fur scarf she is wearing, revealing a diamond star, one of the jewels we have seen) I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police... \nNINOTCHKA You leave me no choice. \nSWANA Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them? \nNINOTCHKA I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them. \nSWANA That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you! \nShe proceeds into the living room, followed by Ninotchka. \nNINOTCHKA They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back! \nSWANA (triumphantly) I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down? \nThey both sit. \nSWANA (very matter-of-fact) Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels. \nNINOTCHKA In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet. \nSWANA Unfortunately. \nNINOTCHKA Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership. \nSWANA My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative. \nNINOTCHKA Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now... \nSWANA I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait. \nNINOTCHKA I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger. \nSWANA No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after. \nNINOTCHKA Go on. \nSWANA I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow. \nNINOTCHKA (quietly) That's not the way to win him back... not Leon. \nSWANA I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova. \nNinotchka knows herself to be faced with an inevitable decision. For a moment she cannot answer. The telephone rings. Ninotchka takes the receiver. \nNINOTCHKA (into telephone) Yes... (it is Leon) Oh hello... \nMuch as she wants to talk to him she hesitates in the presence of Swana. Swana realizes the situation, gets up, and walks over to the window, where she stands looking out. \nCLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA AT TELEPHONE \nNINOTCHKA Good morning, Leon... (forcing herself to be gay so that he will not suspect anything) ... no, you didn't waken me... I am fine, thank you.... Yes, it was... marvelous.... What?... for luncheon? I'm afraid I can't. I am going to be very busy... (looking for excuses) well, I have a lot of things to attend to today.... What?... Well to tell you the truth I am a little tired and I would like to rest... (she forces herself to laugh) you may be right... perhaps it is the champagne.... For dinner?... Of course... seven o'clock here?... (realizing that she will be gone by then) seven o'clock is all right.... Where?... That will be lovely.... Yes... (there is a knock on the door) Come in. (into the telephone) Yes?... (looking toward the door she sees something which makes her stop the conversation) Just a moment... (she puts the receiver on the table and walks toward the door) \nANTEROOM BETWEEN LIVING ROOM AND CORRIDOR, shooting toward the living room. In the background we see Swana standing at the window. Ninotchka comes into the anteroom, closes the door in order to shut off Swana's view. Camera pans with Ninotchka as she walks toward the hall door where the bellboy is putting down a big flower basket. \nNINOTCHKA (to bellboy) You can leave it here. \nThe bellboy exits. Ninotchka looks at the basket of flowers for a moment, then takes the envelope which is attached to the handle. She opens it and reads the enclosed letter. It must be a love note, for her eyes grow wet. She turns to the last page. \nINSERT \n\"...and sweetheart, I have kept my first promise. I sent poor old Gaston to the market this morning and if you will look deep into the flowers you will see what I got for him....\" \nCLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA \nShe puts her hand in the basket and takes out a bottle of milk. \nINSERT OF THE BOTTLE \nOn the label we see a picture of a goat. \nNINOTCHKA \nShe smiles sadly and goes to the telephone, which is on the console in the anteroom. \nNINOTCHKA (into telephone) Operator, will you switch the call please?... Hello?... Darling, your present just arrived.... It's very silly and very wonderful... thank you... No, I won't forget... seven o'clock.... (with great tenderness) Good-by, my darling.... What?... Oh... (softly) salute! \nShe puts down the receiver. Camera pans with her as she goes to the door of the living room. She opens the door and goes in. Swana turns from the window. \nNINOTCHKA I am sorry to have kept you waiting, madame. \nSWANA -- AT THE AIRPORT \nDISSOLVE TO: \n", "test2_true": "ENTRANCE HALL -- SWANA'S APARTMENT \nSwana's maid is opening the door for Swana, who enters in the highest spirits. \nSWANA Good afternoon, Jacqueline. \nMAID Good afternoon, Your Highness. (hesitantly) Madame, I... \nSWANA You didn't find my glove. All right, you're forgiven. \nMAID Thank you, Your Highness. Count d'Algout is waiting. He's been here some time. \nSwana inspects herself briefly in the hall mirror, proceeds into the living room. \nLIVING ROOM -- SWANA'S APARTMENT \nLeon is pacing up and down. Swana enters. \nSWANA Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail? \nLEON No thanks, Swana. \nSWANA Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize? \nLEON I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before. \nSWANA Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession? \nLEON Yes. \nSWANA Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll... \nLEON This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen. \nSWANA All right, I'll listen. \nLEON I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle? \nSWANA Brutal frankness, if you insist. \nLEON There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana. \nSWANA And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so? \nLEON It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana. \nSWANA Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you? \nLEON I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living. \nSWANA Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration. \nLEON I'm afraid that's what it is. \nSWANA The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again. (she glances at her wrist watch) By about five minutes. \nLEON What is this, Swana? \nSWANA Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow. \nLEON Has done what? \nSWANA She's gone, Leon. \nLEON Do you expect me to believe that? \nSwana picks up the receiver of the telephone and holds it out to him. \nSWANA Here's the telephone. If you call the hotel you will find that you have no seven o'clock appointment. \nTHE MOSCOW PLANE \nIt is flying past the Eiffel Tower. \nCLOSE SHOT -- AIRPLANE WINDOW \nBehind the window we see Ninotchka looking at Paris for the last time. Camera moves over to the next window and we see Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski also giving Paris a sad farewell look. \nANOTHER VIEW OF PARIS, from the air. The mist has closed in by now so that only the top of the Eiffel Tower is visible above it. \nCLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA, looking down on the Tower \nINTERIOR, Airplane -- Ninotchka, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski \nNinotchka turns from the window and leans against the back of her chair. The Russians follow her example. There is a moment of silence and sadness. \nBULJANOFF Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower. \nKOPALSKI That's right. \n", "test2_id": 1300, "test3_input": "CLOSE SHOT -- BULJANOFF, IRANOFF, AND KOPALSKI MARCHING. All three are already pretty exhausted from the long march. Kopalski sees Ninotchka. He whispers it to the others. The three look toward Ninotchka and lift their shoulders with a gesture which says, \"Look where we are now.\" \nCLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, answering them with a sad smile. After they have passed she stares straight forward again with the same stern expression. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPANNING SHOT -- STAIRCASE IN NINOTCHKA'S TENEMENT HOUSE \nIt is an overcrowded house. People are walking up and down stairs, standing grouped in front of the various apartments; children are sliding down the banisters and playing games under the feet of the adults. \nNinotchka trudges upstairs wearily. Camera pans with her as she goes into an apartment which is divided into several sub- apartments. Finally she opens the door of her own room and goes in. \nNINOTCHKA'S ROOM \nIt is a comparatively small room, which she shares with two other girls. As she enters only one girl is present. It is Anna, a cello player, who sits on the edge of her bed practicing on her cello. Apparently Ninotchka has not adjusted herself completely to the Moscow which she once thought so great. \nNINOTCHKA Good evening, Anna. \nANNA Good evening, Ninotchka. \nNINOTCHKA Aren't you late? \nANNA No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade. \nDuring the following scene Anna puts her cello in its case and gets ready to go to her job. Ninotchka starts to arrange the table in the center of the floor for a party of four. Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes, a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a tablecloth. \nNINOTCHKA Didn't you march? \nAnna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the Bolshevik regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward it. \nANNA They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, \"There's sabotage in the string section!\" \nNINOTCHKA Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna. \nANNA I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all. (she has noticed Ninotchka's preparations) Are you expecting someone? \nNINOTCHKA A few friends... just a little dinner party. \nANNA What are you serving? \nNINOTCHKA An omelet. \nANNA (puzzled) An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration? \nNINOTCHKA Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage. \nANNA It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet. (devilishly) That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin? \nAt this moment a door to one of the adjoining rooms opens and Gurganov, a middle-aged man with a sour stool-pigeon expression, walks quietly through the room to another door, taking in the girls with one sly glance and giving the impression that not only his eyes but his ears are open. Anna breaks off her remark. \nANNA (whispering) I'll tell you later. (after Gurganov has disappeared into the other room she continues) That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police. \nNINOTCHKA You should be more careful, Anna. \nANNA And you too, Ninotchka. \nNINOTCHKA (amazed) About what? \nANNA Ever since you have been back from Paris... \nNINOTCHKA I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word. \nANNA That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble. \nNINOTCHKA I have nothing to hide. \nANNA You should. I'll show you. \nShe walks over to her cupboard and takes out a piece of lingerie and comes back to Ninotchka with it. \nANNA When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause. \nNINOTCHKA (aware of the pettiness which surrounds her) I see. \nANNA You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution. \nNINOTCHKA Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear. \nANNA (confidentially) Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else? \nNinotchka suddenly is transported to Paris in her memory. \nNINOTCHKA (with feeling) No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this. \nANNA Tell me... what else did you have? \nNINOTCHKA (enjoying the thought) Well, a hat... \nANNA What was it like? \nNINOTCHKA It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here. \n", "test3_true": "NINOTCHKA An evening gown. \nANNA (puzzled) Evening gown? \nNINOTCHKA A dress you wear in the evening. \nANNA What do you wear in the morning? \nNINOTCHKA When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock. \nANNA You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day? \nNINOTCHKA Yes. \nANNA Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating. \nNINOTCHKA No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm.... \nANNA And there? \nNINOTCHKA Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze. \nANNA (fingering the piece of lingerie) They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see. \nNINOTCHKA You feel it, though. \nANNA (hesitantly) Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends. \nNINOTCHKA What is it, Anna? \nANNA You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much... \nNINOTCHKA You want this? \nANNA Just for the honeymoon. \nNINOTCHKA You can have it for good. It is my wedding present. \nAnna is for a moment speechless over this generous gift. She embraces and kisses Ninotchka. \nANNA Ninotchka! Ninotchka! \nShe kisses her again, takes her cello, and starts to leave. \nANNA Am I going to play that cadenza tonight! \nAnna exits, closing the door. Ninotchka is left alone. Her thoughts are still in the other world, obviously with Leon. Mechanically she looks over the table to see if everything is all right, then she walks over to the radio (a primitive little machine). As she turns the knob she smiles again reminiscently. As she does, the blare of a Russian speech brings her back to reality. \nVOICE ON RADIO Individuals? Yes, as atoms in the cosmos of Soviet Russia. Family? Yes. One great family of one hundred and sixty million, struggling, fighting, victorious Russian proletarians. Thus shall we pursue our way into the future, fists clenched, hearts encased in steel armed against bourgeois sentimentality and... \nQuickly she turns the knob and again there is a burst of Russian oratory. \nSECOND VOICE ON RADIO \n...From the Exploiters for the Toilers. We are going full steam ahead through industrialization toward socialism. Let us put the Union of Socialistic Soviet Republics into an automobile and the muzhik into a tractor, and then let the capitalists try to keep up with us! The same thing happens for a third time. \nTHIRD VOICE ON RADIO \n...and thirty million peasants, eighty-five per cent of the population owned three hundred forty-three million four hundred and sixty-nine thousand acres of land, sixty-five per cent of the total area. And one hundred and fifty thousand nobles possessed thirty-five per cent of the country's natural wealth! \nNinotchka turns off the radio. She closes her eyes for a moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself. \nNINOTCHKA No music. \nAt this moment the door opens, and Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski enter. There follow warm greetings between Ninotchka and the Three Russians. \nALL THREE RUSSIANS Ninotchka! Ninotchka! \nA moment of silence follows. The four look at each other as people do who share a secret. \nNINOTCHKA (with great warmth) How are you, you three scoundrels? \nKOPALSKI (wryly) Well, we're back home. \nBULJANOFF (sourly) You know what they say -- there's nothing like home. \nIRANOFF That's right... and we might as well face it. \nNINOTCHKA (trying not to say what she feels) Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave. \nIRANOFF Brave... that's right. \nBULJANOFF Let's be happy that we're all alive. \nIRANOFF And that's something we owe to Ninotchka. \nKOPALSKI If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened? \nBULJANOFF I can tell you exactly. \n", "test3_id": 1301}

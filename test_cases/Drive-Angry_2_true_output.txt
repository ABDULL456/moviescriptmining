INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT 
Piper BURSTS into the room ready to kick ass and take names. But...the place is...empty. Food still on the plates. Beer in the mugs. The TV over the bar is still on. We see footage of a Nevada Amber Alert. âBaby Tabitha still missingâ A photo of a baby in pink onesie. Then appearing beside it...the photo of Jonah King. 
TV NEWS ...issued an all points bulletin for Jonah King's immediate detention in connection with the murder of a young married couple in Loveland, Colorado. Their infant girl is believed to have been abducted by this religious sect. A nation-wide Amber Alert is now in full effect. Piper stares at the TV for a moment, then scans the bar. What the fuck? She eyes the EXIT sign where an assortment of athletic equipment hangs from the wall. 
EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACKLOT - NIGHT 
Piper exits with a hockey stick. A few cars are left in the lot. A black Chevy van with flames stands out, parked in front of a barn/storage building. Piper crosses to a window in the bar/motel. 
THROUGH WINDOW Busboy sits on Piper's bed. Still naked. He holds her nail polish to his nose. Sniffs. Jerks his head back. 
PIPER Imbecile. 
A NOISE Piper spins, grips the hockey stick. No one. The cars are empty. The barn looks undistur... A light GLOWS within the barn, bleeding through the wood slats. Then... CRREEEEEEEK...barn door slowly swings open. ...revealing THREE SILHOUETTES backlit by a hanging lamp. One holds a shovel. The other heaves an ax over his shoulder. The third holds a shotgun. The side door on the flamed van slides open. TWO SILHOUETTES step out. Baseball bat and machete. 
FOOTSTEPS Piper spins as THREE DARK FIGURES appear around the side of the bar/motel. Sledge hammer, iron pipe, sickle. Surrounded. All seven begin walking toward her. Piper rushes back inside. 
INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - NIGHT 
Still empty. Piper turns toward the door marked âMotel Guestsâ then hesitates. Instead she dives under a booth table...as... The back door opens. 
PIPER'S POV LEGS. Three sets. Beat up sneakers. Work boots. Cowboy boots with a duct tape patch. A door opens. Piper sucks in breath. More legs appear. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Shadows approach the desk counter near the âMotel Guestsâ door. There's an open guest book on the counter top. 
CLOSE ON GUEST BOOK As a weathered hand comes into view. A finger traces down to the last two entries. Piper Lee RM 111 John Milton RM 112 
INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - MILTON'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Candy's still on top. She is, as we say in the fuck industry, âcloseâ. 
CANDY Close'm'close'm'close'm'close. Suddenly Milton's head jerks toward the door. His hand shoots beneath his pillow as-- The door BURSTS OPEN! MAN WITH AN IRON PIPE held high rushes into the room. Milton comes up with a 357 hand cannon! 
KAFOOM! IRON PIPE is BLOWN backwards into MAN WITH MACHETE! Milton thrusts upright, suddenly Candy finds herself beneath him as -- Machete HEAVES Iron Pipe to the side and rushes toward Milton as -- KAFOOM! He's blown off his feet! 
KER-SMASH! The window shatters as a MAN WITH BASEBALL BAT dives, hits, rolls and comes up swinging! Milton snakes an arm beneath Candy and rolls from the bed with her! As they fall-- The bat SLAMS onto the mattress just missing them as -- 
KA-BOOM! 
Milton turns Baseball Bat's head into a canoe! Milton on bottom again as they crash to the floor, still intertwined. 
FWOOM! The door adjoining Milton and Piper's room EXPLODES open at his feet! MAN WITH AXE and MAN WITH SHOTGUN enter! Milton, presses Candy's face into his chest, twisting his body to shield her as his 357 THUNDERS twice! Shotgun's eye vaporizes in a mist! He drops to his knees. Man with Axe clutches his throat...blood gushing...turns and flees back into the adjoining room as -- 
KUH-FWAM! The bathroom door flies open! 
MILTON'S POV Staring under the bed, Cowboy boots with duct tape patch appears. Chamber opens. Shells drop to dirty carpet. Milton rolls Candy over, still connected. Fumbles in his bag on the floor. COWBOY with SLEDGE HAMMER freezes at the carnage. Can't see Milton. Because he's hidden by the bed. 
COWBOY WITH SLEDGE Old Man. You know you can't stop what's comin' That little girl's as good as dead. TWO BULLETS slide into the 357. Chamber SNICKS shut. Milton aims under the bed. FIRES! Half the man's foot is blown to hell! He hops then crashes to the floor! He and Milton make eye contact beneath the bed...a nanosecond before Sledge Hammer's forehead implodes.

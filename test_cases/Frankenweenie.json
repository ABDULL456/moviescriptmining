He throws a ball for Sparky which lands on the edge of his neighbours meticulous garden lawn. \nVICTOR Good morning, Mr. Burgemeister! \nNext-door neighbor BURGEMEISTER is trimming his box hedge. The Mayor of New Holland, Burgemeister is slightly OCD and largely insufferable. \nBURGEMEISTER Your dog has been sniffing around my Dutch Dazzlers. The other day I caught him peeing on my flamingo. \nVICTOR I'll keep an eye on him. \nBURGEMEISTER You better. \nVICTOR Yes sir. \nVictor continues to walk to the backyard. \nVICTOR Go on Sparky.

CLASSROOM - DAY \nMR. RZYKRUSKI stands at the blackboard, where he's written his name. He has a thick, impossible-to-place accent, somewhere between a Russian spy and Dracula. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI Good morning children. I am Mr. Rzykruski. I will be your new science teacher. Apparently, Mr. Holcum had an incident. \nEdgar interjects: \nE He got hit by lightning. \nThis is news to Mr. Rzykruski. The rest of the class, including Victor and every child we've met so far, already knew. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI Well. That is bad. But he did not get \"hit by\" lightning. Lightning does not hit a person, the way one is hit by a baseball or a cabbage. \nOn the blackboard, he draws a diagram to illustrate his point, starting with a big cloud. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI Lightning is simply electricity. The cloud is angry, yes, making storm. All the electrons are saying, \"I am leaving you. I go to land of opportunity.\" \nHe draws the ground beneath it. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI The ground says, \"Yes, we need electrons trained in science just like you. Come! Come! Welcome!\" So both sides start to build a ladder. (drawing stick figure) This man, he comes out to look at the storm. He does not see the invisible ladders. When the two ladders meet, BOOM! The circuit is complete and all of the electrons rush to the land of opportunity. This man is in the way.

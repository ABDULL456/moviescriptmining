{"train": "FRANKENWEENIE \nWritten by \nJohn August \nWHIRS and HUMS.    The screen flickers. \nSplices pop through the gate. \nAnd then, today's feature film: \nMONSTERS FROM BEYOND! \nThe title card is made from cut cardboard, and very blurry. \nMOM (O.S.) Victor, I don't know that it's... \nVICTOR (O.S.) Mom, you have to wear the glasses. \nMOM (O.S.) Oh!     Yes of course. \nThick frames slide past. Now we're looking at the title card in real 3D. It's very homemade, but charmingly done. \nThe next card: \nSTARRING SPARKY \nDAD In 3D honey. \nReveal that we are... \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nVictor's MOM and DAD share the couch with SPARKY THE DOG, 30-odd pounds of canine goodness. They're watching the homemade movie through vintage 3D glasses. \nBehind them run two projectors, manned by the filmmaker himself, VICTOR. He's more mad scientist than film auteur -- he built this twin projector system himself. \nMOM So that's where my candlestick went. \nDAD Oh, isn't that your grandmother's table cloth. \nMOM That looks great! \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   2 \nBACK TO THE SCREEN \nThe pterodactyl swoops across town. People run in fear and panic. The monster attacks! \nDAD Oh that is so...Woah! I just felt I was attacked. \nMOM Oh. That's scary. \nTroops and tanks spring into action. \nDAD Send in the marines! \nARMY FIGURE Over here men. This way. \nTo no avail. \nMOM Oh! Watch out! \nDAD Whoah! \nVictor finishes his tinkering and splices the broken film. Satisfied, he snaps the reel back on the projector and starts to roll it again. \nOn the reel of the projector we - \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   TOWN - MORNING \nTight on the wheel of the paper boy's bicycle we pull out to reveal the suburban paradise of New Holland. It's a sea of cookie-cutter houses on cul-de-sac'd streets named after trees. \nThe town comes complete with its own ersatz Dutch windmill, which lazily turns on the hillside above. \nA BIKE-RIDING PAPERBOY delivers the morning news. \nEXT.   VICTOR'S HOUSE / STREET - MORNING \nSparky runs out the front door and grabs the newspaper for Dad. Dad kisses Mom goodbye. \nDAD See you later, sweetie. \nMOM Have a good day! \nDad heads to his car. \nSparky picks up the newspaper in his mouth, then trots back to the house, where Victor is waiting. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    5 \nMOM Victor! Come on honey your going to be late. Go put Sparky in the backyard. \nVICTOR Come on Sparky! \nVictor takes Sparky around to the side of the house. He throws a ball for Sparky which lands on the edge of his neighbours meticulous garden lawn. \nVICTOR Good morning, Mr. Burgemeister! \nNext-door neighbor BURGEMEISTER is trimming his box hedge. The Mayor of New Holland, Burgemeister is slightly OCD and largely insufferable. \nBURGEMEISTER Your dog has been sniffing around my Dutch Dazzlers. The other day I caught him peeing on my flamingo. \nVICTOR I'll keep an eye on him. \nBURGEMEISTER You better. \nVICTOR Yes sir. \nVictor continues to walk to the backyard. \nVICTOR Go on Sparky. That's right. Good boy. \nSparky trots after Victor.   Victor puts him in the back yard and waves good bye. \nVICTOR See you later! \nBurgemeister picks up his own newspaper and unfolds it to read the front page. \nINSERT NEWSPAPER: The headline reads \"MAYOR BURGERMEISTER TO KICK OFF DUTCH DAYS.\" A photo shows Mayor Burgemeister complete with sash and hat. \nBurgemeister is pleased with the photo. \nWIDER: A girl Victor's age tries to sneak out of the house behind Burgemeister. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   6 \nThis is ELSA VAN HELSING. She's a raven-haired fourth- grader with the soul of a poet. \nVictor raises his hand. \nTOSHIAKI But it's not rare. Lightning happens to people all the time here. There's a thunderstorm almost every night. \nBOB My dad got hit twice. \nWEIRD GIRL They built New Holland on an abandoned gold mine... \nTOSHIAKI I heard it was a cemetery. \nWEIRD GIRL That's where they buried the miners. \nNASSOR It's the windmill that does it. \nREVEAL a view of the windmill through the classroom window. \nWe PUSH IN on Nassor, the intense look in his eyes. \nNASSOR Turning, turning the air until the sky itself rages against the night. \nA beat. \nWEIRD GIRL No.   Cemetery. Definitely. \nEXT. BACK YARD - DAY \nSparky amusing himself while Victor is at school by playing with a tennis ball. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   9 \nBut \"catch\" doesn't work too well without Victor and the ball rolls through a broken plank in the bottom of Mr Burgemeister's fence. \nAssuming it is lost forever, Sparky sits dejectedly looking at the fence until he is startled to see the ball suddenly roll back towards him. \nHe BARKS and goes to investigate. \nAnother dog BARKS BACK. \nSurprised, Sparky backs off.   There's not usually a dog next door. \nHe BARKS. \nAn ANSWERING BARK. \nHe SNIFFS the fence thoroughly. As he reaches the broken plank, his nose touches ANOTHER DOG'S NOSE. \nHe jumps back. \nLies low in the grass to peer through. \nOn the other side of the fence is a similarly-sized poodle named PERSEPHONE -- Elsa's dog. She's beautiful. \nShe drops the ball on the grass, staring back. \nSparky suddenly rolls over on his back, completely submissive. \nPersephone grabs the ball and runs away. \nSparky pops up, looking after her. \nINT.   CLASS - DAY \nThe bell RINGS.   Students head for the door. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI Students on your way out, take a permission slip for the Science Fair. \nVICTOR You can keep it. \nThe class bell RINGS.     Side-stepping around her, Victor heads in to class. \nShe holds the cat to her face. \nWEIRD GIRL One day you'll dream about me, won't you kitty? \nMr. Whiskers offers nothing. \nEXT.   TOWN - DAY \nVictor hops off his bike and goes into the backyard where Sparky has been waiting for him to come home. \nVICTOR Hey boy. How you doing? \nSuddenly the backyard gate bursts open. \nE You'll be my partner, right, Victor? (MORE) \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   12 \nE (CONT'D) Because you have to have a partner for the science fair and whoever's your partner is going to win. You know the most about science. So pick me as a partner. I have lots of ideas. We could make a death ray! \nVictor holds up a permission slip, which lists all the prohibited projects, including explosives, lasers, nuclear devices and death rays. \nVICTOR It says no death rays.    See? \nE Ah, man. I still want to do it. (and yet...) C'mon. Who else would be your partner? You don't have friends and neither do I. \nHe has a point.   Victor gives in. \nVICTOR I'm sorry Edgar. I just don't need a partner. I like to work alone. \nINT.   DINING ROOM - DAY \nDad is examining the permission slip. Mom is bringing food in from the kitchen -- they're having fondue. \nVICTOR Will you sign my permission slip? \nMOM Dinner's ready. \nDAD Victor, have I ever talked to you about what I do for a living? \nVICTOR You're a travel agent. \nDAD I sell dreams. I tell people, you can sail to Italy. You can do the hula in Hawaii. \nVICTOR Will you sign my form? \nDAD I'm getting to that. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   13 \nVICTOR Okay. \nDad picks up two long fondue forks, using them to illustrate his point. \nDAD In my job, sometimes you have people who don't want quite the same thing, right. Say the husband wants to play golf in Scotland, but the wife wants to paddle down the Amazon. Alright you've got two conflicting ideas here. (holding forks apart) And it's my job, Victor, to help them meet halfway. Say, Scottsdale, Arizona. He gets to golf, she gets Indians. \nMOM But there's no river. And no jungle. \nVICTOR Nobody gets what they want. \nDAD Exactly. And wrong. They both get what they want because they compromise. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI When conducting an experiment, trying is the important thing. It is OK to fail as long as you keep trying. \nEXT.   BASEBALL FIELD - DAY \nBack on the field at the bleachers Weird Girl arrives with Mr Whiskers. She sits by Elsa and Peresphone. They exchange a glance. \nMOM Come on Victor- you can do it! \nToshiaki pitches again and again Victor misses. \nGYM TEACHER Strike two! \nTOSHIAKI Yes. \nMOM Come on honey! \nElsa, Weird Girl and Mr Whiskers will Victor on. \nThis time when Victor swings - \nHe hits! \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2      16 \nHe almost forgets to run until Sparky BARKS at him. \nDAD (CONT'D) Victor run! \nSparky pulls on his lead and it works loose. \nThe ball rolls out of the park. \nSparky goes after it, his stubby legs bounding. \nMOM Oh Sparky! \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nThe ball rolls into the street and Sparky manages to grab it in his mouth. \nProud of himself, Sparky turns to look back at Victor. Just then... \nA CAR \nSCREECHES up at him.      Sparky reacts.    We CUT AWAY as the car hits. \nEXT.    BASEBALL FIELD - DAY \nEvery player, every kid, every parent is stunned. Horrified. We end CLOSE ON Victor. \nVICTOR Sparky! Noooooo! \nEXT.    PET CEMETERY - EVENING \nDad buries a wooden box. Victor watches at the grave side, devastated. His Mom and Dad give him a quiet moment to grieve. \nEXT.    BACKYARD - EVENING \nPersephone nudges the tennis ball through the gap in the fence. She's waiting for Sparky. \nDisappointed, she leaves the ball and slowly walks away. \nINT. BEDROOM - EVENING \nVictor lies in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Mom and Dad sit on the edge of the bed, trying to comfort him. \nINT. VICTOR'S HOUSE - DAY \nVictor raids the kitchen for some household appliances. Mom sits on the couch reading and only barely registers what he is up to. \nMOM Hi Victor, how was school? \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   19 \nVICTOR Ok. \nVictor heads upstairs with a box of the appliances he has just collected. \nEXT. PET CEMETERY - NIGHT \nA full moon.    HOOTING owls. \nOver the top of the fence, we see a shovel blade moving past. \nThe shovel digs into the soft earth.   Again.   And again. \nVictor is digging up Sparky's grave. It's tough work, especially because he's trying to be quiet. \nA black cat perches on a nearby gravestone.     SCREECHES. \nSpooked, Victor waves him off. \nHe's uncovered the box. He opens it and gingerly loads the wrapped bundle into shoulder. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nVictor's parents are sitting on the couch watching a movie. Though the movie isn't really scary, Mom looks for any excuse to snuggle closer to her husband. He playfully encourages it and puts his arm around her to pull her closer. \nAs Victor sneaks behind them, carrying the wrapped corpse, he inadvertently knocks into a lamp causing it to flicker. \nDad turns and sees what's back there but can't see Victor who is hiding, frozen, just out of sight. \nDad turns back to the TV. \nRelieved, Victor tiptoes past them, heading for the stairs. \nINT. ATTIC LABORATORY - NIGHT \nEXTREMELY CLOSE ON the eye of a needle.   Thread pushes through. \nVictor is making repairs to Sparky's corpse. We don't see any of it directly, just shadows on the wall. \nHe rummages through a bucket of nuts and screws, picking two oversized bolts. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2     20 \nHe places Sparky onto Mom's ironing board and pushes it directly under the skylight. The storm is just reaching a fever pitch. \nAs HOPEFUL MUSIC rises, Victor climbs a ladder out the window where we see that he has attached his metal swing set to the roof. Victor checks the wind direction and lets fly two balloons attached to the umbrella and fastens the ends to the swing set. This will serve as the conductor. \nEXT. BURGEMEISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBurgemeister is drawing his drapes shut when he sees the movement on the Frankenstein roof. He can't make out Victor, but it's enough to make him suspicious. \nINT. ATTIC LABORATORY - NIGHT \nVictor climbs down and checks his notes and his equipment. \nWe see a whole host of household items that Victor has re- purposed to become part of his elaborate apparatus. \n- A series of Mom's colanders and pans and appliances, \nMOM (O.S.) Victor! \nINT.   BEDROOM - DAY \nVictor's Mom opens the door to find Victor's bed empty. Pretty sure where he must be... \nMOM Victor!     Breakfast! \nINT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY \nSparky licks Victor's face waking him up. He sits up, rubbing his eyes. \nINT. ATTIC STAIRS- DAY \nMom is walking up the stairs to the attic looking for Victor. \nMOM Victor?     Are you up here? \nINT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY \nVictor hears his Mom climbing the steps and panics. \nVICTOR Ssssh! Quiet down boy! Ssssh! \nMOM (O.S.) Victor? \nVictor picks up Sparky and carries him around a curtain to the back of the attic. \nVICTOR Sparky! Sssh! Quiet. \nMom enters but can't see Victor and Sparky behind the curtain. \nMOM (O.S.) Victor? \nLooking around for somewhere to hide Sparky, Victor finally grabs a big tin bucket and puts it over Sparky just as - \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   23 \nMom pulls the curtain back. \nMOM French toast or waffles? \nVICTOR Waffles. \nMOM Then I'll need my waffle iron back, Mr. Director. \nSpotting her waffle iron amid the leftover set decoration, she heads right for Sparky. The bucket suddenly moves, shifting away. \nShe looks at Victor.   Thinking quick: \nVICTOR It's my science project.   It's a robot. \nMOM A robotic bucket? \nVICTOR Yes. \nMOM For mopping, I suppose. \nVICTOR Yes. \nMOM Then maybe when you're finished, you'll let me use it. \nShe takes her waffle iron and heads back downstairs. \nVictor closes the curtain, then lifts the bucket off Sparky. \nE Hey! \nVICTOR Edgar. What are you doing here? \nE I know. \nVICTOR What? \nE I know. \nVICTOR Know what? \nE You know. \nVICTOR No. \nE I think I know what you know I know. \nVICTOR Look, I don't know what you think I know, but I don't know it. \nMom exits the kitchen and Edgar leans in, barely able to hide his excitement. \nE Your dog is alive. \nVictor looks shocked and checks to see if Mom has gone. \nVICTOR That's impossible. \nE I know. I know it is so impossible but you did it. You did it. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   30 \nVictor stalls, trying to think of an explanation. \nE So show me how, or I'll tell everyone. Oh Mrs Frankenstein... \nVICTOR Ssssh! \nMom comes back into the kitchen. \nE .. May I have a cookie please? \nMOM Oh- yes. Of course. \nVICTOR Alright. Come on. \nVictor reluctantly agrees and beckons Edgar to follow him up to the attic. \nINT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY \nSparky and E watch as Victor draws his findings on the chalkboard for E. It's a mess of symbols and variables, all connected by arrows. \nVICTOR I think the wind and the lightning are part of the same thing, some kind of strange force. But the wind isn't strong enough to bring an animal back from the dead. For that, you need lightning. \nE So when can I do it? \nVICTOR You can't. This isn't an experiment. It's my dog. \nE Show and tell Victor:   you show me and I won't tell. \nINT.   PET STORE - DAY \nE stares into a tank of swimming goldfish, the PET STORE OWNER appears next to him. \nPET STORE OWNER Can I help you young man? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   BOB'S GARAGE - NIGHT \nToshiaki and Bob stand in the door way of the garage examining E's jar with healthy skepticism. \nTOSHIAKI How are we supposed to see an invisible goldfish? \nE Put your finger in.       You can feel it. \nToshiaki and Bob trade a look -- this feels like a prank. But with a shrug, Bob does. \nNothing.   He swirls his finger around. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   33 \nAnd then... \nBOB Aaah! \nHe yanks his finger out. \nBOB It bit me. \nTOSHIAKI Let me see it. \nToshiaki takes the jar from E. He walks over to a table and places the jar down. He shines a table lamp through the jar. \nThe invisible goldfish casts a shadow on the wall. In the shadow, you can see it actually has Jurassic-sized teeth. It's pretty scary. \nTOSHIAKI/BOB *GASP* \nToshiaki turns off the lamp and takes a closer look at the jar. \nE takes the jar back.    Screws on the lid. \nE It's my science project and it's top secret. \nToshiaki looks over to Bob and gives him a flick of the head. Bob takes the hint and starts to push E out of the garage. \nBOB Yeah, well, our science fair project is even cooler. \nE What is it? \nTOSHIAKI Double top secret. \nToshiaki pulls the garage door shut in Edgar's face. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   TOSHIAKI'S GARAGE - NIGHT \nToshiaki and Bob take a critical look at their science fair project: SEA MONKEYS - THE TRUTH REVEALED! \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    34 \nBOB Sea monkeys. We gotta come up with something better. Bigger. \nTOSHIAKI I know. \nBOB The science fair is in two days! \nTOSHIAKI I know. \nBOB You're the smart one. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   36 \nPUSHING IN ominously... \nNASSOR I don't know what kind of game you and Victor are playing. But that trophy will be mine! \nE *Gasp* \nA beat. \nEXT.   STREET - DAY \nE runs as fast as he can with his jar outstretched in front of him, catching up to Victor. It's just the two of them. \nE Victor! Something's wrong with my fish. \nVICTOR What is it? \nE It's not there anymore. \nVICTOR Maybe it just hopped out.   Did you have the lid on? \nE Yes! Ever since...since I left your house. I mean, it was there when I went to bed. \nVictor ponders the possibilities. \nE I'm thinking, maybe they don't last. They're only there for a little bit and then they're gone. \nSuddenly panicked, Victor runs back to his house. \nINT.   HOUSE - DAY \nVictor runs up the stairs. \nINT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY \nVictor runs through the attic. He pulls the curtain back his eyes go right to where he left Sparky tied up. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   37 \nThe rope is still there.    But his dog is gone. \nVICTOR *Gasp* No!    Sparky! *Gasp* \nA BARK. \nVictor turns to find Sparky drinking out of his bowl. \nHe scratches his ear and it falls off. \nVICTOR (O.S.) Sparky! \nVictor rushes over to him. Sparky's not sure what all the drama is about but does seem slightly concerned with his lost ear. \nVICTOR Oh! Don't worry. I can fix that too. \nINT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT \nVictor is in bed.    He reaches under the bed to pat Sparky's head... \nVICTOR Good night, boy. \n...then switches off the light. \nTRANSITION TO: \nBOB'S MOTHER What were you boys doing on the roof!? \nBob and Toshiaki exchange a glance. \nBOB AND TOSHIAKI Science. \nINT. SCHOOL ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT \nMom and Dad arrive at the meeting as Mr Burgemeister starts to speak at the podium. \nBURGEMEISTER As mayor of New Holland, you have entrusted me with your safety. So I can't sit idly by while a teacher endangers our children. \nBob's Mother is also on the stage with Bob whose arm is still in a sling. \nBOB'S MOTHER The man is a menace! \nA lot of agreement from the PARENTS in attendance. \nAnother father stands up in the crowd. \nANOTHER FATHER Have you looked through this \"science\" book they're using? Apparently, Pluto isn't good enough to be a planet anymore. (MORE) \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   40 \nANOTHER FATHER (CONT'D) When I was a kid, Pluto was a great planet. This guy comes along and rewrites the rules. \nMOM In fairness, he didn't write the textbook. \nDAD Mr Mayor, Edward Frankenstein, your neighbour of course. I would just like to say that our son Victor is just crazy about the new teacher. Thinks he's great. \nANOTHER MOTHER My Cynthia has been asking all sorts of strange questions. About things I've never even heard of! \nDAD Shouldn't we at least give the man the chance to explain himself? \nBURGEMEISTER Yes. Please come up. Mr...Menace. \nHe points to Mr. Rzykruski, who has been lingering at the back of the assembly room. \nHe comes up front to the microphone. \nHe clears his throat. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI Ladies, Gentlemen. I think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant. \nA sea of stony faces. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI Is this right word, \"ignorant?\"    I mean simple. Primitive. Unenlightened. \nNot winning them over. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI You do not understand science, so you are afraid of it. Like a dog is afraid of thunder, or balloons. To you, science is magic and witchcraft because you have such small minds. (MORE) \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2     41 \nMR. RZYKRUSKI (CONT'D) I cannot make your heads bigger, but your children's heads -- I can take them and crack them open. This is what I try to do. To get at their brains. \nMOM Oh my! \nMr. Rzykruski somehow convinced he did a good job... \nMR. RZYKRUSKI Thank you. \nMr Rzykruski leaves the stage. \nDAD Oh, geeze. \nElsa kneels down and pets Persephone lovingly. \nELSA I feel so sad for him, Persephone. He really misses his dog. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    43 \nShe tenderly kisses Persephone on the head and holds her a little closer. \nEXT. SCHOOL \nMr Rzykruski walks out of the school doors carrying a cardboard box full of all his school things. \nINT.   CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe Gym Teacher, who is serving as substitute teacher scrubs the board clear of Mr Rzykruski's name. \nVICTOR Where's Mr. Rzykruski? \nGYM TEACHER All I know is, I'll be teaching the class for the rest of the semester. \nShe begins erasing the messy blackboard. \nELSA Do you know anything about science? \nGYM TEACHER I know more than you do. \nBOB Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot. \nGYM TEACHER Well, sometimes knowing too much is the problem. \nVictor looks out the window as Mr Rzykruski is packing up the trunk of his car. \nVICTOR What about the science fair? \nGYM TEACHER Oh, it's still on. But it will be judged by someone who is not insane -- Me! \nThe class look skeptical. \nGYM TEACHER Now get cracking and may the best person win. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    44 \nEXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY \nMr. Rzykruski is packing his strange little car with all his things from the classroom. \nVictor races up to him in the car park. \nVICTOR I can't believe they let the gym teacher be the judge. She's not even interested in science. \nMr. Rzykruski turns back to see his favorite student. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI Back home, everyone is scientist. Even my plumber wins Nobel Prize. Your country does not make enough scientists. Always needs more. You should be a scientist, Victor. \nVICTOR Nobody likes scientists. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI They like what science gives them, but not the questions, no, not the questions that science asks. \nVICTOR Actually I have a question. \nMR. RZYKRUSKI That is why you are scientist. \nVictor smiles, a little. \nVICTOR I was doing my experiment, my project, and the first time it worked great. But the next time it didn't. I mean, it sort of worked, but then it didn't. And I don't know why. \nTOSHIAKI Impossible. \nE I swear! I mean, he already brought back his dog. \nHe tries to swallow his words but the boys lean in closer. \nTOSHIAKI He brought back Sparky? \nE nods and the boys exchange a look. \nTOSHIAKI Hmmmm. \nNASSOR Victor will win the science fair. Unless we can do better. Bigger. \nToshiaki turns his steely gaze towards Edgar and a sly smile spreads across his face. \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   47 \nTOSHIAKI You say you know Victor's secret. Now is your chance to prove it. \nINT.   KITCHEN - DAY \nMom's recipe book is opened to a page that reads - \n- DOUBLE DUTCH CHERRY MUFFINS \nMOM Now, where is my muffin tin? \nShe checks inside the oven but no muffin tin. \nMOM (realizing) Victor. \nINT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY \nVICTOR'S MOM goes up into the attic to find... \nNothing out of the ordinary. \nShe enters, taking a look around for her missing muffin tin. She walks over to Victor's chalk board and sees his diagrams for bringing Sparky back to life. \nMOM Sparky? \nSparky walks around the curtain and stands panting next to Mom. \nShe turns, startled and sees - Sparky. \nHis NECK BOLTS. \nHis STITCHES. \nMom falls backwards and onto the floor and - \nSCREAMS. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDad enters the house to hear Mom screaming in the attic. \nINT.

Sparky's alive! \nMOM Sparky! \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   50 \nDAD Sparky! \nAs they go in their respective directions we see Toshiaki, Edgar, Nassor and Weird Girl skulking in the bushes. \nToshiaki nudges Edgar forward and motions to the front door which has been left ajar in their haste. \nINT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nWe see the shadows of all five of them slowly climb the attic stairs. \nE pulls the curtain back to reveal Victor's sanctum sanctorum. The apparatus glistens in the moonlight. \nBOB Cool. \nNassor and Weird Girl check out the equipment - pushing and pulling on the wires with clumsy curiosity. \nEdgar tries to confer with Toshiaki who turns his back dismissively. Its clear there are no more partnerships. Its every man for himself. \nToshiaki examines the formulas and theorems on the blackboard. \nTOSHIAKI Interesting. \nE It has something to do with the lightning. I don't really understand it. \nTOSHIAKI Ah-but I do. \nPUSHING IN on his eyes... \nNASSOR Tonight, we shall bring the dead to life. \nEXT.   NEAR THE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS \nVictor runs around the baseball field shining the flashlight under the bleachers and into the dug out. \nVICTOR Sparky!    Where are you? Sparky! \nJanuary 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   51 \nEXT. PET CEMETERY - NIGHT \nSparky narrowly avoids some kids running towards the town center by backing into an open gate. \nAs the revelers pass he looks around at where he is and sees that he is surrounded by ominous looking headstones. \nAn eerie Cat \nA giant turtle \nA flock of bats fly out from behind a tombstone and force him up the hillside where he finds himself at the foot of his own grave. \nHe can't read, but he seems to recognize what it is. What it means. \nHe lays down, looking up at the moon. \nEXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT \nBack in town we see Victor's parents searching under the stage as the crowd starts to assemble for Dutch day. \nMOM Sparky? Sparky? \nThe crowd applauds as Mr. Burgemeister steps up to the microphone. \nNassor enters the mausoleum and attaches two clips onto the grave of Collosus. He exits the mausoleum and sends four Mylar balloons off into the sky. \nEXT.   TOSHIAKI'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nToshiaki exits the gardening shed and walks over to his bundle. He attaches two clips and hooks these up to a kite by using a series of extension cords. \nINT.

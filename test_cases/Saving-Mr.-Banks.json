He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings Ginty up so she is facing him. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) You trust me? She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over his shoulder. He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her arms. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Gee up, Albert. Yah! Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Yah! Ginty squeals with delight. \nINT. LIMOSINE - MORNING \nPamela looks out of the window at the palm trees, the empty sidewalks. She looks dazed, extremely tired-- \nPAMELA Nobody walks. \nRALPH \n(SADLY) Leisurely stroll's a gift. \nEXT. LAUREL CANYON - MORNING \nThe limo floats along the windy canyon roads, cresting the top of the hill and revealing an awe inspiring vista. \nRALPH Beautiful ain't it? \nPAMELA (refusing him the \nSATISFACTION) If you like that sort of thing. \nRALPH I do. \nEXT. FIELD - ALLORA - DAY \nTravers and Ginty gallop at great speed. The horse kicking up great clods of earth as they hurtle away into the distance. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nDon DaGradi and the Shermans are escorting Pamela along a row of storyboard illustrations for the film. Dolly trundles along behind, carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which Pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from. \nDON We do find it helps to have a visual. It's fun! She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house. \nPAMELA No, no, no. Goodness no. \nDICK No? \nPAMELA The Banks house doesn't look like that! My house is a terraced house with a pink door, white bricked with a crack in the gable. The window frames are lead-lined and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums to go with the pink \nDOOR AND-- (gesturing to the tape \nRECORDER) Did we get that? (to herself, slightly \nHYSTERICAL) Oh dear, it's all a big mistake. It's all wrong. \nDON It's all wrong? \nPAMELA It's too grand! The Banks family - they're normal, everyday sort of people. This isn't normal. It isn't everyday! They're not aristocrats! \nDICK Interesting. Don allows a tiny smile. She is right. Pamela lingers over a picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of something like recognition on her face and then she simply moves on. \nPAMELA \n(TO HERSELF) Okay. She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks wearing a suffragette ribbon. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) \n(SIGHING) Do I even have to say it? \nDON Um-- yeah? \nPAMELA Why in the world have you made Mrs Banks a silly suffragette? \nBOB I wonder if Emmeline P would agree with that adjective-- \nPAMELA Quite possibly, looking back. Dick mouths `oh my god!' \nDON It does seem strange that Mrs Banks allows her children to spend all of their time with the nanny when she has no job to speak of-- \nPAMELA Are you calling Mrs Banks neglectful? \nBOB Yep. \n", "test1_true": "PAMELA Being a mother is a job. A very difficult job and one that not everybody is up to, that not everybody should have taken on in the first place! The boys see that Pamela is talking about something meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief moment, until-- \nPAMELA (CONT'D) I will NOT have her called Cynthia! Absolutely not. It feels unlucky. Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) No it should be something warm, a bit sexy. They all nearly choke at the word `sexy' coming out of her mouth. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) How about Mavis? \nDON Sybil? \nBOB Sure. \nPAMELA Prudence? \nDICK Gwendolyn? \nBOB Great. \nPAMELA Winifred! \nDON I could go with Winifred. \nPAMELA Yes, that's because it's very good. She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) This isn't Mr Banks? She turns to face Don and the boys. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) This isn't him. \nDON Ahm, yeah, that's him-- \nPAMELA He has a set of moustaches! \nDON In the books he-- \nPAMELA I told the illustrator I didn't like the facial hair but she chose to ignore me. This is MY film and this time around I shall have MY way. \nDOLLY (clearing her throat) Mrs Travers, it was a specific request, from Walt. Pamela doesn't acknowledge that Dolly has spoken; Dolly flushes. \nPAMELA (to the boys) Why? Everyone shrugs, they don't know why. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is clean shaven! Bob buries his face in his hands and let's out a long, loud, unashamed moan. \nBOB Does it mattterrrrrrr?! \nDON Bob, Bob, Bob-- Pamela stares at Bob. \nPAMELA You can wait outside! She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. Bob is literally stunned. Dick stifles a laugh. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) I shan't say it again Robert. Bob storms out of the room (as fast as his limp and cane will allow him) slamming the door and from behind it we hear: \nBOB (O.S.) \nKILL ME! KILL ME NOW! \nPAMELA \n(TO DICK) What is wrong with his leg? \nDICK He got shot. \nPAMELA Hardly surprising. Pamela smiles sweetly. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Can I expect anymore drama from anyone else? \nINT. BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON \nPamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies the bar, full of people laughing, exclaiming, enjoying one another's company. She takes it in melancholically for a second and then jabs the elevator button repeatedly, relieved when the doors finally slide open. \nINT. GOFF HOUSE - WASHROOM - ALLORA - MORNING \nTravers faces his reflection in the mirror as Ginty looks on from the doorway. He picks up his razor and begins to scrape away the stubble. \nGINTY Why do you do that? \nTRAVERS For you my dear! (he flicks the blade in the air like a swordsman) Swish! Which kind of kisses do you prefer Gintamina? Swoosh! Scratchy ones or silky ones? \nGINTY \n", "test1_id": 1431, "test2_input": "INT. LIMO - MORNING \nRalph looks at Pamela in his rear-view, she seems weak, the steely fight flown away on the East wind. Her arms wrapped around her chest, her face turned to the window. \nRALPH Ya alright Mrs? Pamela doesn't even hear him. \nINT. ALLORA SCHOOL - AFTERNOON \nGinty stares out of the window, in a daydream, a paintbrush in her hand, dripping colour down her arm. She is nudged to the present by her teacher, MRS CORRY. \nMRS CORRY Helen Goff? Wake up dear. You want your banner to be ready for the fair don't you? Ginty turns back to her painting - her banner reads: \nALLORA FAIR Around the words Ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with stunning horses, one of which is white with roses on its bridal. \nINT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY \nMargaret, Biddy and Ginty walk into the fairground. Tents are erected, farmers show off their sheep, children clutch sticks of cotton candy and a carousel spins with one stunning white horse amongst the drearier others, roses upon its bridal. \nBIDDY Mrs Brill said Father's presenting the medals. \nMARGARET (a flutter of pride) He is indeed! On behalf of the bank. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING \nPamela stares out of the window, not really concentrating on what's going on in the room. \nDON Mrs Travers? Again, she doesn't hear. \nDON (CONT'D) Mrs Travers? Pamela looks at Don. \nDON (CONT'D) We were just saying that we'd like to play you the song in the bank. \n(BEAT) Would that be good? Pamela nods, noncommittal. \nDON (CONT'D) (as Dawes Snr) So you have tuppence? May I be permitted to see it? (changing voice to Michael \nBANKS) No, I want it to feed the birds! (back to Dawes Snr) Fiddlesticks boy! Feed the birds and what've you got? \nDON/DICK/BOB Fat birds! \nDICK (singing more sotto than \nUSUAL) But! If you invest your tuppence wisely in the bank \nEXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY \nDICK (V.O.) Safe and sound-- A small stage and dais stand central of the event over which a large sign reads: \nSPONSORED BY THE BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA \nDICK (V.O.) Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank will compound-- The Allora townsfolk are out in force. Ginty walks with her family. Her father attempting to memorise speech notes as they pass through the crowds. \nDICK (V.O.) And you'll achieve that sense of \nCONQUEST-- Margaret nudges him as Randolph Belhatchett and his family walk past. \nTRAVERS (clears his throat) Mr Belhatchett. Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his family nod and move on. Margaret looks upset by this. \nDICK (V.O.) As your affluence expands-- Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them to Ginty and Biddy. \nMARGARET Travers, Biddy's stomach-- \nTRAVERS Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop whinnying like an old nag will you? Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but she keep her mouth shut. Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments tent. \nGINTY \n(PANICKED) Father-- will you ride the carousel with me!? But the refreshment tent has Travers in its grip. \nTRAVERS Meet you there in a blink of an eye! \nINT.

Her face falls but she takes Biddy by the hand and heads for the stage. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Come on Biddy. \nINT. REFRESHMENT TENT - DAY \nGinty appears in the tent's entrance. On first glance she sees only an unidentified group of local drinkers. Relief begins to dawn and she turns away. It is then that she hears Travers laugh, and turns back to see the group part, revealing Travers at its centre. \nTRAVERS Indeed, a published poet-- She takes a deep breath and moves forward, grabs Travers hand. \nGINTY Father, come and look. Biddy's dancing. \nTRAVERS In a moment, my princess. I'm talking. \n(BEAT) Back in Ireland, I miss her green \nHILLS SO-- \nGINTY But she's-- she really wants you to watch, Dad. You'll miss it. \nTRAVERS Not now Biddy! \nGINTY I'm Ginty. \nTRAVERS Ginty! Shoo! Devastated, Ginty doesn't know what to do, she pulls at his shirt sleeve again. \nGINTY You said don't give up. A waiter approaches and takes her by the arm, leading her away. \nWAITER Excuse me, Miss. It's gentlemen only in this section of the tent. I think you'll be more comfortable at the far end. \n(BEAT) Are you alright sweetheart? \nGINTY \n(TO WAITER) I'm scared my father is-- Despairing she looks up and sees her mother, carrying Moya, in the entrance. Her mother's face falls and crumples. \nEXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS \nTravers steps heavily, one at a time, up the steps onto the dais, and finds his way to the speaker's podium. Margaret and Ginty watch, hearts in mouths, Biddy blissfully unaware. \nTRAVERS Good afternoon, distinguished guests, our biggest supporter Mr Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of the bank staff. \nRANDOLPH Why is he speaking for the bank? \nBANK WORKER He's the manager. \nTRAVERS I'm honoured to be here on behalf of the Belhatchett Bank of Australia. Shortly, it will be my very pleasant duty to present the awards to our young performers. But before I begin, I'd like to say a very few words to our very youngest citizens about the role of the - er, the Bank in our community. Ginty allows herself to breathe. So far, so good. \nMARGARET He's using too many `verys'. He always says `very' too much when \nHE'S-- She can't say it. Ginty takes her mother's hand but Margaret pushes the hand away. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nPamela turns away from Don and the Shermans and takes herself to look at a sketch of Mr Banks, pinned to the wall, he still has a moustache. \nDON (as Dawes Snr) Very well, my boy, give me the \nMONEY \n(AS MICHAEL) No I won't I want it to feed the birds! (as Dawes Snr) Banks! \n(AS BANKS) Yes sir.

She notices Mickey's innocent eyes staring at her and gently turns his face away. \nWALT Oh come on! When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?! \nPAMELA Disappointments are to the soul what the thunderstorm is to the air. Walt slams the phone down. Pamela stares at it in shock! \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Hello? Hello? He hung up! I'm! I! I can't believe he hung up! Walt leans back in his chair and grins, Tommie enters. \nWALT I'm not a violent man Tommie but if Mrs P.L. Travers were to get hit by a large truck I-- (he doesn't allow himself \nTO FINISH) \nINT.

Walt flings the door to the room open. \nWALT Okay boys. We gotta fix this. \nINT. GOFF HOUSE - TRAVERS BEDROOM - ALLORA - MORNING \nGinty sits beside her father, he is restless and sweating in his sleep as she wipes his face with a damp sponge. The sound of a buggy pulling up outside breaks the silence. \nMARGARET (O.S.) Oh my! And then a new voice, clear as a crystal bell. \nAUNT ELLIE (O.S.) Margaret, my poor child. I simply had to come. We must fix this. Travers eyes spring wide open in horror. \nTRAVERS The Aunt. \nINT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - MORNING \nA parrot headed umbrella hangs from the back of a chair. An enormous carpetbag - similar to the one Pamela carries - plonked on the living room table and there beside it, upright, imposing and matronly is AUNT ELLIE herself. Hair scraped back, hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket - a very different version but Mary Poppins all the same. Ginty looks on in awed silence as Ellie begins to remove an endless supply of belongings from her bag. \nELLIE Now, I've brought every new fangled treatment available in Sydney. Biddy is open mouthed. \nELLIE (CONT'D) Close your mouth please Biddy, we are not a codfish. (to both girls) I spy a multitude of jobs to be done! \nMARGARET They've been so worried-- I've-- \nELLIE Do stop babbling nonsense! I'm here now and I shall fix everything. \n(BEAT) Girls! \n(BEAT) Feverfew and camomile to lower his body temperature. Garlic, sorrel, sage. Deadly nightshade. And if those don't work-- well I shouldn't like to say. Young Pamela and Biddy look on in a kind of bewildered trance as item after item emerges from the carpetbag. \nELLIE (CONT'D) --tincture of horseradish-- \nLAUDANUM-- (to Ginty and Biddy) \n(MORE) \nELLIE (CONT'D) I thought I had made it quite clear you were to begin helping. Ellie claps her hands together. \nELLIE (CONT'D) Spit spot! \nINT. LIMOSINE - MORNING \nRalph drives along solemnly. Pamela looks out of the window, confused. \nPAMELA Where are we--? This isn't the way. \nRALPH Change of venue this morning apparently. \nPAMELA (realizing where she's \nBEING TAKEN) Ugh. \nRALPH I was thinking about our-- tea party? \nPAMELA I'm sure I don't know what you're-- \n", "test3_true": "(OVER) Yesterday, the little park. \nPAMELA Little park?

CAR - CONTINUOUS \nRalph is goggle-eyed at seeing Walt. \nRALPH Oh! Isn't that nice? Holy mackerel! Wowzers. Never met him myself but there he is! Right there. Real. Living, breathing. Oh boy! \nEXT. DISNEYLAND - DAY \nRalph jump out of the car to let his passenger out but Disney is there first. \nWALT Welcome to the Magic Kingdom! Pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of her head with brightness of the place, unbelievable colour and excitement. \nPAMELA Is it all like this? Pamela pops a headache pill. \nWALT Yup! Isn't it wonderful? Ralph hovers at the car, filling his eyeballs with as much Walt Disney as he can get before he has to drive away. \nPAMELA Do you always get everything you want Walter? \nWALT Pretty much! \nPAMELA With the exception to the rights to my books of course! \nWALT War ain't over yet Pam! Walt takes Pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates and a murmur goes through the crowds as they gawp. A YOUNG WOMAN breaks free and rushes up to Walt. \nYOUNG WOMAN I love you so much! Can I--? She proffers a pen and paper but Walt is prepared, he takes a signed postcard with his face on it from his top pocket and hands it to the woman. \nPAMELA \n(DISGUSTED) Pre-signed? \nWALT \n(TO WOMAN) You should get hers too. (gesturing to Pamela) This woman's a bona fide genius! The woman looks expectantly at Pamela who just snorts. she realizes she's getting nothing and, clutching her precious postcard to her chest, melts back into the crowd who part like the red sea for Walt and his guest. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DISNEYLAND - CONTINUOUS \nWalt and Pamela make their way down Main Street. Walt stops anyone from getting too close by immediately handing out postcards to anyone who gets near. \nWALT In Adventureland there is a tree-- this is a fun fact. A titbit. \nPAMELA Tidbit. \nWALT \n(OVER) It has three million leaves, four million flowers. \nPAMELA Gosh. \nWALT And they said only God could make a tree! Pamela rolls her eyes. There is a protracted silence as they walk, both encompassed by their own thoughts. The sunshine, the joyful crowds just background colour. They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window. It reads: Elias Disney Contractor Est. 1895. Pamela notices the look but doesn't say anything. \nWALT (CONT'D) Where did she come from? \nPAMELA Who? \nWALT I think you know who. \nPAMELA She flew in through the window one day. \nWALT Through the window huh? Pamela nods curtly. \nWALT (CONT'D) It's just that easy isn't it Mrs Travers? He sees right through her. \nWALT (CONT'D) I know you don't wanna be here so I'm gonna take you to one ride-- my favourite amusement and then I'll set you free. Way ahead of them the carousel spins in the distance. \n", "test3_id": 1433}

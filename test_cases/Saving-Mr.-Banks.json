{"train": "SAVING MR. BANKS \nWritten by \nKelly Marcel & Sue Smith \nEXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - AUSTRALIA - DAY (1906) \nOVER BLACK: MUSIC - string violins treat us to a familiar song opening and then a voice - male. \nTRAVERS (V.O.) \n(SINGING) Winds in the East Mist coming in-- \nFADE IN: A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning, spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella) dances amongst the nimbus. \nTRAVERS (V.O.) --Like something is brewing, about to begin-- The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small town in the distance. \nTRAVERS (V.O.) --Can't put me finger on what lies \nIN STORE-- Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large, bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens. There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod. She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we will also know as GINTY.) \nTRAVERS (V.O.) --But I feel what's to happen, all \nHAPPENED BEFORE-- Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind becomes real. \nINT. SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELA'S OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING (1961) \nP.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of stiff and steely determination. Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding. Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful, white. Downstairs the doorbell rings. Pamela closes her eyes, breathes. It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up, smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes. \nINT. SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING \nPamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold. DIARMUID RUSSELL (45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked inside. Pamela is not pleased to see him. \nDIARMUID Mrs Travers. \nINT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nPamela and Diarmuid sit in silence. Diarmuid looks at her, she looks out of the window. \nDIARMUID PAMELA You're ready to--? Like pink clouds on sticks. \nDIARMUID Excuse me? \nPAMELA The cherry blossoms \n(BEAT) I was trying to think of what they-- Diarmuid looks at his watch. \nDIARMUID The car should be here, may I use-- \n(THE PHONE) \nPAMELA \n(OVER) I cancelled it. \nDIARMUID You--? \n(PANICKED) What? Pamela! \nPAMELA Mrs Travers. \nDIARMUID Mrs Travers, please, why-- (sugaring his tone) Why would you cancel the car? \nPAMELA I shan't be going. Diarmuid buries his face in his hands. \nDIARMUID We've been through this-- \nPAMELA I've changed my mind. \nDIARMUID You can't. \nPAMELA With all due respect Mr Russell I am on very good terms with my own faculty and exceedingly confident in its decision making capabilities. Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long frustrated breath. \nDIARMUID You made an agreement. Do you understand? A verbal agreement. \nPAMELA Why in the world are you speaking to me as if I am a neonate? \nDIARMUID \nDIARMUID (CONT'D) What do you say? \nPAMELA \n(TO HERSELF) I want to keep my house. \nEXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY \nA large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and smiles. TRAVERS GOFF (35) is handsome and rugged, a wild poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas. \nTRAVERS Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my daughter? I was quite sure I had left her around here somewhere! Ginty giggles. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm- - goodness! I've quite forgotten! Could it be Prunella? \nGINTY No! \nTRAVERS Pamela? \nGINTY No. \nTRAVERS You're right still doesn't sound quite-- I'm sure I have a special name for her-- \nGINTY Ginty! \nTRAVERS Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is of course! \n(BEAT) Now, have you seen her? \nGINTY It's me! Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her face. \nTRAVERS Gosh! So it is! Well, thank goodness for that! I was positive I was going to be beheaded for losing Her Highness The Royal Princess Ginty Mc Featherfluffy! \nGINTY You can't lose me! \nTRAVERS Never. I promise. I will never lose you! He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through the park, neighing like a horse. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Hurry now! We mustn't be late! The adventure is about to begin! \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nPamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet bag into an overhead locker. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Can I help you? \nPAMELA I'm perfectly capable thank you. The flight attendant tries to help anyway. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) They've used all the space; so greedy. She glares at the people around her. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT I'll take it Madam. I can put it up here - \nPAMELA I don't want it up there. I want it here, in the corresponding holding area for my assigned seat! \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT The flight's closing in just a few moments Ma'am. I'll have to take it. Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say `I dare you.' A woman, with an infant, stands up. \nWOMAN \n(TO ATTENDANT) You can put my bag up front instead. The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the woman's bag with Pamela's. \nPAMELA \n(TO WOMAN) Will the child be a nuisance? It's an eleven hour flight. \nWOMAN \n(TAKEN ABACK) Er-- no, I-- \nPAMELA Jolly good. Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at the tarmac. She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) \n(TO HERSELF) I hope we crash. The passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified! \nEXT. GOFF RESIDENCE - MARYBOROUGH - DAY (1906) \nBIDDY (3) and MARGARET - the girls mother, delicate, weak - stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home. Suitcases bulge at their feet. Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from his shoulders and plops her on the ground. \nMARGARET The carriage? \nTRAVERS Who needs a carriage my love? A stroll is a gift! (beat, excited) Everybody ready? \nPAMELA Be quiet! \nRALPH Yes ma'am. Ralph starts the engine and drives away. \nEXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY \nTHREE MEN in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the enormous gates of Disney's Burbank Studio and pulls up in a very twee forecourt. They are: DON DAGRADI (45) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT (34), he leans on an old worn cane and RICHARD (31), who has a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face. Don opens the car door for Pamela and puts out a hand to help her from the vehicle but she pushes it away. \nDON Pamela! Good morning! \nPAMELA It is so discomfiting to hear a perfect stranger use my first name. Mrs Travers. Please. The Sherman's look at each other. Uh oh. \nDON I do apologize, Mrs Travers. \n(BEAT) I am Don DaGradi, the script writer. \nPAMELA Co-script-writer. I shall certainly be having my say Mr. DiGraydi. \nDON Gradi. Wonderful! I welcome it. \nPAMELA If indeed we ever sign off on a script. Bob and Dick flash each other a look. What the fu ? \nDON Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of your team, Dick and Bob Sherman! Music and lyrics. \n(TO SHERMANS) Boys, this is the one and only Mrs P.L. Travers, creator of our beloved Mary. \nPAMELA Poppins. \nDON Who else? \nPAMELA Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary. (to Dick and Bob) A pleasure to meet you, though I fear we shan't be acquainted for too long. \nBOB Excuse me? \nPAMELA These books simply do not lend themselves to chirping and prancing. No. Certainly not a musical. Now, where is Mister Disney? I'd very much like to get this started and finished as briskly as is humanly possible. \nBOB Don? \nDICK PAMELA Not a music--? If you'll point me in his direction? \nDON Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a little tour of the studio for you \nMRS TRAVERS-- \nPAMELA No thank you. \nDON --Wanted to show the place off. \nPAMELA No one likes a show off. Pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building. \nDON Mrs Trav-- it's a long way to-- Don hurries behind her, Bob looks like he is about to murder the woman and Dick is finding the whole thing incredibly amusing. \nEXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY \nThe Shermans, Don and Pamela are riding through the studios on a golf buggy. \nPAMELA I am perfectly capable of walking. A couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Shoo! Go away! The characters stop bouncing and Di Gradi gives them a nod meaning `beat it'. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Ghastly. Bob and Dick Sherman are in shock. \nINT. DISNEY - EXTERIOR OFFICE - DAY \nDon leads Pamela into the plushly appointed outer office, where DOLLY - a young, perky secretary - smiles brightly at her. \nDON \n(TO DOLLY) Could you let-- \nPAMELA (over, to Dolly) Would you let Mister Disney know I have arrived please? Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and picks up the phone. \nDOLLY (whispering into phone) She's here! \nDON A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I may. \nPAMELA You may. Whether I heed it or not will be another matter entirely. \nDON Wow. Uhm. It's just that he can't stand being called Mr Disney. We are all on a first name basis here. \nPAMELA My name, if you please, is MRS Travers. \nWALT You see, I promised them. That's a fact. You got kids? \nPAMELA \nNOT-- \nWALT \n(OVER) I have never, I swear, never broken a promise to either one of my Disney girls. \nPAMELA Well, that's very honourable of you \nBUT-- \nWALT That's what being a daddy is all about right? \nPAMELA \n(DEEP BREATH) Is it? \nWALT This movie isn't just going to make my kids happy. It's going to make ALL kids happy! You see my guys are gonna do things with it that are, well, are revolutionary. He's up again. \nWALT (CONT'D) REVOLUTIONARY,Pam! \nPAMELA \nOH DEAR-- Pamela rubs her temples as she watches him fly about the room. \nWALT Mary Poppins will literally fly off the pages of your books! The door opens and Tommie comes in with the tea, Walt gestures for her to bring it to him. \nWALT (CONT'D) Now imagine! This magical woman who has only lived in your head, you'll be able to meet her, speak to her, hear her sing. Tommie places the tray on Walt's desk and leaves the room. Walt picks up the tea pot. \nPAMELA Yes, this singing, I am glad you've come to that. (addressing his tea \nMAKING) Milk first! Walt puts the pot down immediately like a scolded child and picks up the milk jug, he pours. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) That's right. Now the tea-- He picks up the pot again and pours the tea. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) And a spoonful of sugar. He stirs. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) You don't mean for this film to be a musical? \nWALT \n(TAKEN ABACK) I absolutely do! He presents her with the cup. \nPAMELA No. \nWALT No? \nPAMELA No. She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any good. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Not bad. No, Mister Disney, Mary Poppins does not sing. \nWALT Oh yes she does! \nPAMELA When? \nWALT In your books! \nPAMELA Those aren't songs! They're recitations. She is not a giddy woman, she does not jig! Singing is frivolous and wholly unnecessary for a governess, an educatress. No. It would just ruin it. Walt is baffled. He takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs loudly. Pamela's jaw drops. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons. Walt takes a sharp breath on `silly' and then plasters the smile back on. \nWALT Tell ya what. You just listen to what my Sherman boys have come up with and if they don't knock your socks off then I'm the King of England. Pamela rolls her eyes. \nPAMELA If you're the King of England then you shan't exist and knowing the little of you I do; I shouldn't think you would like that very much. \nWALT Bet you would. She smirks, as does he. \nPAMELA \n(BEAT) I do quite like Greensleeves. \nWALT Greensleeves huh? \nPAMELA Come to think of it. That's a song I wouldn't object to. \nDAGRADI) What is all this jollification? \nDON We have a whole script to get through. It's gonna be a long day Mrs T. She shoots him dead with a killer stare. \nDON (CONT'D) --ravers. \nPAMELA We could save a starving country with benefaction from this room alone! Ugh, It's so vulgar. She gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the table and plops it on top of Dick's piano. Bob moves it from the piano to the floor. \nBOB \n(SEETHING) That is a very expensive piano. \nPAMELA And these are beautiful blooms butchered for our visual and nasal enjoyment when we could have just as easily gone to the window, looked out and gazed upon them happily minding their own business and very much still alive. Bob hasn't a clue what to say. Pamela smoothes down her skirt and re-takes her seat. Everybody waits. Pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which Don duly turns on. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Let us begin. She perches her glasses on her nose and raises an eyebrow at the cover of her script - \"Walt Disney's Mary Poppins.\" \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Hm. A rustling of papers and one or two uneasy glances as the men, too, open their scripts. \nDON DAGRADI PAMELA \n(READING) (READING) Scene one. Exterior Cherry Scene one. Ext. Ext? What's Tree Lane. London. Day. Bert-- Ext? \nDick and Bob cover their faces with the embarrassment of it all. \nDON Exterior. It means the scene is taking place outside. \nPAMELA Ah, I see, an abbreviation. \n(BEAT) Scene One. Exterior-- \n(BEAT) Oh, I'm sorry Mr DaGradi, did you feel you should--? \nDON No, No, Mrs Travers please go ahead. \nPAMELA Yes, I do think it's best. I've the most practise. Readings of my books you know? Anyway-- \n(BEAT) Scene one. Exterior. 17 Cherry Tree Lane, London. Day. She nods. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Yes. That's good, that can stay. \nDICK \n(LAUGHING) That's just the scene heading! \nPAMELA --Though I do think we should say number 17, instead of just 17, yes? It's proper. \nBOB & DICK No one's going to see it. \nPAMELA I will see it. She makes a note in her script and looks to the others who are dumbstruck. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Write it down, write it down, chop chop. Don makes the note and is ready to move on but Pamela is staring at Dick and Bob. They dutifully pick up their pencils and note their scripts too. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Is that on the tape? Don glances towards the swirling tape recorder and nods. \nDON Yes. \nPAMELA Good-- onwards. They are interrupted by DOLLY carrying a new tray of refreshments. \nDOLLY I'm sorry to interrupt. \nPAMELA Is this a joke? \nDOLLY Excuse me? \nPAMELA Do you think you are a comedienne? \nDOLLY I'm sorry I don't understand. Dolly gingerly places the tray on the table and hovers, distributing fruit and biscuits within reachable distance. \nPAMELA Unbelievable. Pamela shakes her head but decides to ignore Dolly and carry on. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Scene One. Exterior. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane. London. Day. \n(MORE) \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Bert, a one-man band-- (she looks up) The rumour is that this is to be your Mister Van Dyke is it? \nDICK We do hope so! \nPAMELA Hmmm, we'll see about that. He's totally wrong, totally and utterly. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Do you want to know what it feels like to fly Ginty? She nods. He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings Ginty up so she is facing him. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) You trust me? She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over his shoulder. He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her arms. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Gee up, Albert. Yah! Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Yah! Ginty squeals with delight. \nINT. LIMOSINE - MORNING \nPamela looks out of the window at the palm trees, the empty sidewalks. She looks dazed, extremely tired-- \nPAMELA Nobody walks. \nRALPH \n(SADLY) Leisurely stroll's a gift. \nEXT. LAUREL CANYON - MORNING \nThe limo floats along the windy canyon roads, cresting the top of the hill and revealing an awe inspiring vista. \nRALPH Beautiful ain't it? \nPAMELA (refusing him the \nSATISFACTION) If you like that sort of thing. \nRALPH I do. \nEXT. FIELD - ALLORA - DAY \nTravers and Ginty gallop at great speed. The horse kicking up great clods of earth as they hurtle away into the distance. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nDon DaGradi and the Shermans are escorting Pamela along a row of storyboard illustrations for the film. Dolly trundles along behind, carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which Pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from. \nDON We do find it helps to have a visual. It's fun! She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house. \nPAMELA No, no, no. Goodness no. \nDICK No? \nPAMELA The Banks house doesn't look like that! My house is a terraced house with a pink door, white bricked with a crack in the gable. The window frames are lead-lined and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums to go with the pink \nDOOR AND-- (gesturing to the tape \nRECORDER) Did we get that? (to herself, slightly \nHYSTERICAL) Oh dear, it's all a big mistake. It's all wrong. \nDON It's all wrong? \nPAMELA It's too grand! The Banks family - they're normal, everyday sort of people. This isn't normal. It isn't everyday! They're not aristocrats! \nDICK Interesting. Don allows a tiny smile. She is right. Pamela lingers over a picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of something like recognition on her face and then she simply moves on. \nPAMELA \n(TO HERSELF) Okay. She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks wearing a suffragette ribbon. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) \n(SIGHING) Do I even have to say it? \nDON Um-- yeah? \nPAMELA Why in the world have you made Mrs Banks a silly suffragette? \nBOB I wonder if Emmeline P would agree with that adjective-- \nPAMELA Quite possibly, looking back. Dick mouths `oh my god!' \nDON It does seem strange that Mrs Banks allows her children to spend all of their time with the nanny when she has no job to speak of-- \nPAMELA Are you calling Mrs Banks neglectful? \nBOB Yep. \n(THINKS) Silky ones. A man must shave for to spare his daughter's cheeks! Swish! \nINT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - MORNING \nPamela stares at herself in the clouded bathroom mirror. She runs a finger through the steam on the glass. \nPAMELA Swish. And again. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Swoosh. \nINT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - DAY \nDolly, carrying a tray of cakes, stops at the rehearsal room door where fractious voices ring out. \nPAMELA (O.S.) Stop! Stop! Stop! What on earth are you talking about? Supercali--? Supercali-- or whatever the infernal thing is! \nDICK It's something to say when you don't know what to say! \nPAMELA Well I always know what to say. The slamming of a piano lid. Dolly pushes the door open with her foot. \nPAMELA (O.S.) (CONT'D) If you so much as step one foot in here with that tray I shall scream! One cannot live on cake alone! \nINT. DISNEY OFFICE - DAY \nDolly stands in Disney's office. \nDISNEY Hit me with it. \nDOLLY She has a lot of-- ideas. \nDISNEY Ya? What kind of ideas? \nDOLLY About how she, uh, sees things. \nDISNEY And just how does she `see' things? Dolly sighs and pulls out a note pad. \nDOLLY \n(READING) The name Cynthia has been changed to Winifred. \nWALT Okay that'll work. \nDOLLY She won't approve Dick Van Dyke. Walt laughs, Dolly allows herself a little giggle too. \nDOLLY (CONT'D) The sketches of the Banks house make it look too opulent, there must be no hint of romance between Mary Poppins and Bert, she wants to know why Mr Banks has been given a moustache, the-- \nWALT I asked for that. \nDOLLY Yes. They did tell her but she wants to know why. \nWALT Because I asked for it. \nDOLLY Right. Of course. Uh-- the tape measure Mary Poppins uses to record Jane and Micheal's height must be a roll tape, not a ruler, we must add gravi-- gravitas, she says. \nDISNEY Gahd! Anything else? \nDOLLY She only wants green vegetables and broth, I don't know what that is but she wants it in the room from now on and oh! She doesn't want the colour red in the film-- at all. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nDick, Don and Pamela sit around the meeting table. Bob hovers by the door in a right humph. Disney prefers to stand, grazing occasionally from a bowl of candy. \nPAMELA I've simply gone off the colour. Their mouths are agape. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) You did say I was to have final say did you not? \nDISNEY We can't make the film without the colour red! It's set in London for pete's sake. \nPAMELA And? \nDISNEY There's buses and mail boxes and guards uniforms-- heck! The British flag! Pamela, I'm not sure why \nYOU'RE-- \nPAMELA I understand your predicament Mr Disney, I do. I just-- hm-- I don't know what it is, I'm just suddenly very anti-red. I shan't be wearing it ever again. Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks eyes with her. \nDISNEY Is this a test Pam? Are you requiring proof of how badly I wanna make you happy so that we can create this beautiful thing together? Pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about `creating something beautiful' with Walt, but quickly recovers and eyeballs him right back. \nPAMELA I took you at your word Mr Disney and it seems my first stipulation has been denied. There will be many more, so-- perhaps we should just call it quits and I should hand you back these? She takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it to him. Disney smiles at Pamela. \nDICK Hurry, Nanny! \nMANY THANKS Sincerely, Jane and Michael Banks: Jane and Michael Banks. \nPAMELA Well I simply don't know what to say. That's the worst song I've ever heard. \n(BEAT) Ever. \nDICK Alright. \nINT. DISNEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nWalt stands looking out of his window. \nDISNEY POV: Pamela sits on a bench, her feet tucked together, her arms clasped around her body, her face to the sky. She sits perfectly still until the limo pulls up and Ralph gets out, patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her. Pamela, opens her eyes and Ralph nods hello. He opens the back door for her and she climbs in. \nWALT Tommie! Tommie appears in his office with a glass and hands it to Walt. \nTOMMIE Scotch Mist. \nWALT What do you think? \nTOMMIE What do I think I-- what? \nWALT You're a woman. \nTOMMIE That's a canny observation Walt. \nWALT What am I missing? \nTOMMIE You think the female of the species has some kind of psychic insight when it comes to others of her kind? Walt continues to stare out of the window. \nTOMMIE (CONT'D) We don't. \n(BEAT) You'll get yourself an ulcer with all that unriddling. Give it up. Tommie waits for a response but he's still window bound, filled with intrigue as he watches the car disappear. \nWALT \n(UNDER) That woman. \nINT. BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON \nPamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies the bar again, a few people chatting over cocktails. The elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar instead. \nBARMAN Good afternoon Ma'am. What can I fix you? \nPAMELA A pot of tea. \nBARMAN Sure thing. Pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical Mrs Travers. The tea pot arrives. \nPAMELA Thank you. Tea is a balm for the soul don't you agree? But the barman has already moved on to another patron. Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come and go. The barman talks with another customer further along the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring into her empty cup. \nEXT. BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA - ALLORA - DAY \nGinty - in a rather tattered school uniform - is diminutive in front of the huge double doors to the bank. An upright, top hatted gentleman holds the door of the bank open chivalrously for her. \nINT. BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS \nGinty and the man enter the bank. \nGINTY Thank you. A bank worker tips his hat to the gentleman. \nBANK WORKER Good afternoon Mr Belhatchett. Cashiers look up from their posts and nod courteously. Ginty and RANDOLPH BELHATCHETT are startled for a second by a loud crash. Their eyes flit to the glass door of Travers' office. The etching on the glass reads: \nTRAVERS GOFF - BANK MANAGER \nINT. TRAVERS OFFICE - DAY \nTravers has just dropped (purposefully) a tray of coins on the floor. He has a wild edge to him, he may well have been drinking. \nTRAVERS \n(TO CLERK) Belhatchett. Bell. Hatchett. Ha! It's a ridiculous moniker! \nCLERK \nSIR-- \nTRAVERS And Mr Belhatchett has complained that I opened his stupid bank five minutes late has he? Hahaaa! (in a comedy voice) Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's money my man! The clerk laughs nervously. \nDICK It's gotta be like a slogan! \nBOB Her prescription for life. \nDICK Yeah! Yes! A stitch in time! \nBOB An apple a day. \nDON (from across the room) Time and tide wait for-- \nBOB Sugar! \nDICK Sugar? \nDICK (CONT'D) What? That's not-- \nBOB Jeff had vaccination day at school yesterday. \nDICK Ouch. \nBOB No ouch. \nDICK No ouch? \nBOB Sugar. They put it in a cube. \nDICK Medicine in sugar? \nBOB Cube's an odd word. \nBOB (CONT'D) Spoonful? Dick throws his hands and legs in the air almost falling off his stool! \nDON \n(UNDER) Yeah, we have sugar. \nEXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - MORNING \nPamela steps from the car and Walt is there to greet her. \nWALT May I walk with you? \nPAMELA I'm sure your country doesn't have any laws about sharing a pavement. As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the rehearsal room window and down onto the lot. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING \nDick is playing about with a verse. \nBOB Go back to the chorus. \nDICK & BOB (singing it incorrectly) Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down! \nBOB Wait! WAIT! She always does what's unexpected. She goes UP the bannisters. Dick is confused. \nBOB (CONT'D) So go up. Dick plays a high note. \nBOB (CONT'D) Try B. He takes a pencil from behind his ear and marks Dick's sheet music. Dick immediately begins finding the tune on the piano \nDICK & BOB (singing `down' in an up \nKEY) Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. Don looks up from his sketching. \nDICK Yes! The sound of Walt's cough signals his imminent arrival. \nDON Man is in the forest. Pamela and Walt enter the room. \nDON (CONT'D) \n(TO WALT) I want you to hear this. (to the boys) Play him what you got. Walt takes a seat beside the piano. Pamela folds her arms across her chest defiantly. \nDICK It's just a chorus-- \nBOB Tell us what you think. He knows dum dum Will help dum dum dum duuuum! Bob whistles what will end up being the Robin's part of the song. \nDICK \n(SINGING) Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down-- the medicine go do-own, medicine go down Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down In a most de da dee daaa! \nBOB We'll work out the other lyrics. \nINT. LIMO - MORNING \nRalph looks at Pamela in his rear-view, she seems weak, the steely fight flown away on the East wind. Her arms wrapped around her chest, her face turned to the window. \nRALPH Ya alright Mrs? Pamela doesn't even hear him. \nINT. ALLORA SCHOOL - AFTERNOON \nGinty stares out of the window, in a daydream, a paintbrush in her hand, dripping colour down her arm. She is nudged to the present by her teacher, MRS CORRY. \nMRS CORRY Helen Goff? Wake up dear. You want your banner to be ready for the fair don't you? Ginty turns back to her painting - her banner reads: \nALLORA FAIR Around the words Ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with stunning horses, one of which is white with roses on its bridal. \nINT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY \nMargaret, Biddy and Ginty walk into the fairground. Tents are erected, farmers show off their sheep, children clutch sticks of cotton candy and a carousel spins with one stunning white horse amongst the drearier others, roses upon its bridal. \nBIDDY Mrs Brill said Father's presenting the medals. \nMARGARET (a flutter of pride) He is indeed! On behalf of the bank. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING \nPamela stares out of the window, not really concentrating on what's going on in the room. \nDON Mrs Travers? Again, she doesn't hear. \nDON (CONT'D) Mrs Travers? Pamela looks at Don. \nDON (CONT'D) We were just saying that we'd like to play you the song in the bank. \n(BEAT) Would that be good? Pamela nods, noncommittal. \nDON (CONT'D) (as Dawes Snr) So you have tuppence? May I be permitted to see it? (changing voice to Michael \nBANKS) No, I want it to feed the birds! (back to Dawes Snr) Fiddlesticks boy! Feed the birds and what've you got? \nDON/DICK/BOB Fat birds! \nDICK (singing more sotto than \nUSUAL) But! If you invest your tuppence wisely in the bank \nEXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY \nDICK (V.O.) Safe and sound-- A small stage and dais stand central of the event over which a large sign reads: \nSPONSORED BY THE BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA \nDICK (V.O.) Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank will compound-- The Allora townsfolk are out in force. Ginty walks with her family. Her father attempting to memorise speech notes as they pass through the crowds. \nDICK (V.O.) And you'll achieve that sense of \nCONQUEST-- Margaret nudges him as Randolph Belhatchett and his family walk past. \nTRAVERS (clears his throat) Mr Belhatchett. Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his family nod and move on. Margaret looks upset by this. \nDICK (V.O.) As your affluence expands-- Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them to Ginty and Biddy. \nMARGARET Travers, Biddy's stomach-- \nTRAVERS Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop whinnying like an old nag will you? Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but she keep her mouth shut. Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments tent. \nGINTY \n(PANICKED) Father-- will you ride the carousel with me!? But the refreshment tent has Travers in its grip. \nTRAVERS Meet you there in a blink of an eye! \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nAs before. \nDICK \n(SINGING) In the hands of the directors who invest as propriety demands. \nEXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY \nTravers is now in lip synch with Dick Sherman. \nTRAVERS DICK (V.O.) And you'll achieve that sense And you'll achieve that sense of stature of stature As your influence expands as your influence expands To the high financial strata To the high financial strata That established credit now That established credit now \nCOMMANDS-- COMMANDS-- \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDon is up and singing with the boys. They are enjoying themselves so much that they don't notice Pamela's eyes well slightly. \nDON/DICK/BOB You can purchase first and second \nTRUST DEEDS Think of the foreclosures! Bonds! Chattels! Dividends! Shares! \nEXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS \nAs before. \nTRAVERS Bankruptcies! Debtor sales! Opportunities! All manner of private enterprise! Shipyards! The Mercantile! Collieries! Tanneries! Incorporations! Amalgamations! Banks! \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAs before. \nDON (as Dawes Snr) While stand the banks of England. England stands! \nEXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS \nThere's a smattering of applause, Travers is encouraged, Margaret and Ginty look relieved, even hopeful. But then Travers momentarily looks lost, a slight breeze tugs the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front of the dais. \nTRAVERS Uhmm. Thank you kindly. Thanking you. Now-- what, what am I doing next? Oh! It's a marvellous idea to encourage children to open accounts. My daughter, the Princess Ginty-- she's-- uh. (looks at Ginty) How old are you? Come up here. Ginty - what? Me? Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs, makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais. Margaret watches, growing uneasy. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Ginty has a bank account-- and that's good. Give her a drink! The audience is shocked. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) \n(MUMBLING) I mean give her a hand. Everyone is beginning to look uncomfortable. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) I shall return in just a moment to present the awards. But right now I must-- relieve myself. Gasps from the audience. Margaret - dying. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will you? I'm busting. There's a good girl. Father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage, Travers leaning on Ginty's shoulder. The shameful glare of Allora burning into them. \nDON (O.S.) When fall the banks of England, England falls! Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps and topples off the stage. There's an audible, horrible snap as he lands in an undignified pile. But, despite his ugly injury, Travers cannot stop laughing. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe boys are laughing, congratulating one another. \nDON I love it! \nDICK You think Walt's gonna like it? Pamela takes a last look at the Mr Banks picture and spins around viciously. \nPAMELA Why did you have to make him so cruel? The boys jubilance is halted immediately. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) He was not a monster! \nDON Who are we talking about? I'm confused. \nPAMELA You all have children yes? \nDON Yes. \nDICK BOB Yep. Yes. \nPAMELA And do those children write you letters, make drawings for you? \nDON Of course. \nDICK Mine like to make folded paper-- \nPAMELA (cutting him off) And would you tear up those gifts? In front of them?! Silence. They know where this is going. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) It's a dreadful thing to do! I don't understand! Why must father tear up the advertisement his children have written and throw it in the fireplace!? Why won't he mend their kite? Why have you made him so unspeakably awful? \n(BEAT) For all the world to see, in glorious technicolor? You claim to make them live-- if that happens can't he? Can't they at least live well? Pamela chokes back a sudden rush of distress. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) I can't bear it. \n(SOFTLY) \nRALPH \nMA'AM; I-- Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a small line through the grass then hands it to him. \nPAMELA Make a little furrow, there. Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil. Ralph pokes the ground, thinking. \nRALPH I gotta kid. \nPAMELA Well, most people do. \nRALPH Jane-- she's got all kinds of troubles. Pamela raises an eyebrow. \nRALPH (CONT'D) Handicapped you know? Myelitis-- transverse. \n(BEAT) She's in a wheelchair see? That's why I concern myself with the weather-- sunny day she can sit out in the garden. Rainy day I have to leave her cooped up inside. \n(BEAT) Worry `bout the future, but then I stop cuz you can't do that. Only today. Pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes holes in it. \nPAMELA Now look. She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig struts forming a roof. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) It's a band stand. She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid into Ralph's trench, which runs all the way around the park. \nRALPH A river! \nPAMELA \n(CORRECTING HIM) Lake. \nRALPH Lake. \n(BEAT) Hey! I wish I could take her there! He points at the miniature park. \nPAMELA Wouldn't that be nice? \nINT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGinty, Biddy and Moya sleep soundly, Ginty clutching the poem to her chest. The door creeps open and Margaret stands in the shadows looking at her children, tears stream down her face but she seems calm, something has crossed over in her eyes. There's just nothing there-- \nMARGARET \n(WHISPERING) I know you gave it to him. (squeezing Ginty's hand) All the hope is in the bottom of that bottle, Helen. \nGINTY Mother? \nMARGARET I want you to take care of the children. Ginty is groggy, she doesn't understand. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Watch over them. Ginty sits up. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) I know you love your father more. But one day you'll understand. \nGINTY What? Margaret leaves the room and Ginty is straight out of bed following her. Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is crying. \nEXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - NIGHT \nGinty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden like some ethereal ghost. \nGINTY Mother! She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy. \nBIDDY (O.S.) Ginty! Ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her mother but Margaret has disappeared into the darkness. \nGINTY \n(CALLING) Mother! Mother! The baby is screaming now. \nINT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGinty wrenches the eiderdown off the bed and wraps Biddy in it, she scoops Moya up from the crib. \nBIDDY Where's ma? \nGINTY Once upon a time there were three little girls alone in a house. They were frightened of the big wide world just outside the door. She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar and he looks incredibly frail and delirious. \nGINTY (CONT'D) They were so afraid. She moves forward, her eyes flit to the front door, expecting her mother to be standing there any minute but there is nothing. \nEXT. CREEK - NIGHT \nThe mud-stained hem of Margaret's nightdress sweeps along the ground, as her feet move towards, and then into, the water of the creek. One step, two, three, the water coming up over her ankles, soaking the nightgown. \nGINTY (V.O.) But the stars were guarding them, they glittered as they spoke \"We shall send a guide to show them the way to the magical ladder which will bring them all the way up to \nPAMELA Ha! \nWALT Aren't you wondering that too? Silence. \nWALT (CONT'D) (he has an idea) You know, you've never been to Disneyland! It's the happiest place on Earth! (shouting away from the \nPHONE) Tommie! Cancel my morning tomorrow. I'm taking a ride with my favorite author! \n(INTO PHONE) Any excuse. \nPAMELA I cannot tell you how uninterested, no, positively sickened I am at the thought of going to see your dollar printing machine Mr-- Walter. She notices Mickey's innocent eyes staring at her and gently turns his face away. \nWALT Oh come on! When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?! \nPAMELA Disappointments are to the soul what the thunderstorm is to the air. Walt slams the phone down. Pamela stares at it in shock! \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Hello? Hello? He hung up! I'm! I! I can't believe he hung up! Walt leans back in his chair and grins, Tommie enters. \nWALT I'm not a violent man Tommie but if Mrs P.L. Travers were to get hit by a large truck I-- (he doesn't allow himself \nTO FINISH) \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nDick, Bob and Don are drained. They stare at each other in silence. Just the look tells us how much this all means to them. It's desperate. Walt flings the door to the room open. \nWALT Okay boys. We gotta fix this. \nINT. GOFF HOUSE - TRAVERS BEDROOM - ALLORA - MORNING \nGinty sits beside her father, he is restless and sweating in his sleep as she wipes his face with a damp sponge. The sound of a buggy pulling up outside breaks the silence. \nMARGARET (O.S.) Oh my! And then a new voice, clear as a crystal bell. \nAUNT ELLIE (O.S.) Margaret, my poor child. I simply had to come. We must fix this. Travers eyes spring wide open in horror. \nTRAVERS The Aunt. \nINT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - MORNING \nA parrot headed umbrella hangs from the back of a chair. An enormous carpetbag - similar to the one Pamela carries - plonked on the living room table and there beside it, upright, imposing and matronly is AUNT ELLIE herself. Hair scraped back, hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket - a very different version but Mary Poppins all the same. Ginty looks on in awed silence as Ellie begins to remove an endless supply of belongings from her bag. \nELLIE Now, I've brought every new fangled treatment available in Sydney. Biddy is open mouthed. \nELLIE (CONT'D) Close your mouth please Biddy, we are not a codfish. (to both girls) I spy a multitude of jobs to be done! \nMARGARET They've been so worried-- I've-- \nELLIE Do stop babbling nonsense! I'm here now and I shall fix everything. \n(BEAT) Girls! \n(BEAT) Feverfew and camomile to lower his body temperature. Garlic, sorrel, sage. Deadly nightshade. And if those don't work-- well I shouldn't like to say. Young Pamela and Biddy look on in a kind of bewildered trance as item after item emerges from the carpetbag. \nELLIE (CONT'D) --tincture of horseradish-- \nLAUDANUM-- (to Ginty and Biddy) \n(MORE) \nELLIE (CONT'D) I thought I had made it quite clear you were to begin helping. Ellie claps her hands together. \nELLIE (CONT'D) Spit spot! \nINT. LIMOSINE - MORNING \nRalph drives along solemnly. Pamela looks out of the window, confused. \nPAMELA Where are we--? This isn't the way. \nRALPH Change of venue this morning apparently. \nPAMELA (realizing where she's \nBEING TAKEN) Ugh. \nRALPH I was thinking about our-- tea party? \nPAMELA I'm sure I don't know what you're-- \n(TO PAMELA) So Jolly Holiday's in? \nPAMELA As you wish. Pamela is genuinely curious. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Now, how in the world does Mister Disney propose to train penguins to dance?! \nBOB Are you serious? \nPAMELA I've heard about his implausibly leaved trees so I assume he does have some insane penguin wrangling scheme but it does seem rather far fetched. Can you train penguins? \nDON \n(LAUGHING) No I don't think you can train an \nACTUAL-- \nDICK \n(OVER) They're animated. Pamela is confounded. \nPAMELA Sorry? \nDON Dick. \nDICK Cartoons. He draws a little squiggle in the air to illustrate his point. \nDON Dick. Pamela's face turns beetroot red, she pushes herself away from the table and storms out of the room, slamming the door behind her. \nDON (CONT'D) Crap. \nDICK What? Are we getting real penguins? \nINT. DISNEY - OUTER OFFICE - DAY \nPamela comes storming into the offices suite. Dolly smiles up from her desk. \nDOLLY Good afternoon Mrs Travers! \nPAMELA Where is Mister Disney? \nDOLLY If you'd like to take a seat-- \nPAMELA I would not like to take a seat thank you. I would like to-- She heads for Disney's office and Dolly is up and running after her down the corridor. \nDOLLY Mrs Travers, please! Pamela blows past Tommie's desk. \nPAMELA \nDISNEY! \nINT. WALT'S OFFICE - DAY \nPamela pushes open Walt's doors, catching him in the midst of signing a stack of postcards of his grinning face, an unlit cigarette in his pen hand. \nTOMMIE Walt, I'm so sorry. \nWALT Don't worry Tommie, please close the door. Disney gestures to his cigarette. \nWALT (CONT'D) Never let anybody see me smoking. I'd hate to encourage bad habits. Please, sit down. \nPAMELA I shall not sit in the seat of a trickster! A fraudster! A sneak! \nWALT \nPAMELA-- \nPAMELA \nMRS TRAVERS. PLEASE! \nWALT Mrs Travers, what in the world has upset you so? \nPAMELA Penguins! Walt is confused. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Penguins have very much upset me Mister Disney! Animated, dancing penguins! Now, you have seduced me with the music Mr Disney, yes you have. Those Sherman boys have quite turned my head but I shall not be moved on the matter of cartoons. Not one inch sir! \nWALT It's a sequence-- \nPAMELA You promised me. You promised me that this film would not be an animation! \nDISNEY He's? \nPAMELA I just-- Goodbye Mr Disney. She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her but Ralph blocks it. \nRALPH The lady's ready to go now sir. Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car. \nWALT He's? Walt watches the car disappear, wracked with frustration and confusion. He takes a seat on Pamela's bench and wraps his arms around himself and looks to the sky. \nEXT. LAX - DAY \nRalph climbs out of the limo and opens the back door for Pamela. He gestures for a valet to come and take her bags and opens the trunk of the car. \nRALPH It's been a pleasure driving you Mrs. \nPAMELA No one likes a fibber. \nRALPH \n(CHUCKLES) I really have enjoyed it. Didn't know who you were at first and then guess what? \nPAMELA You found out? \nRALPH I was telling my daughter all about my day and how I was driving this nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for Mr Disney and-- \nPAMELA \nAND-- \nRALPH \nAND-- (he leans into the \nPASSENGER WINDOW) And she makes me go to her bedroom and get this! (he pulls out a Mary \nPOPPINS BOOK) Can't stop reading it. I'm very slow mind you. Pamela smiles. \nPAMELA Would you like me to sign it? \nRALPH \n(DELIGHTED) Would you?! \nPAMELA I'd be honoured. Ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Your daughters name? \nRALPH Jane. \nPAMELA Really? \nRALPH Uh huh. Like the girl in the book. \nPAMELA (reading as she writes) To Jane and her dearest father-- (she looks at him) I've just this instant realized I don't know your name. \nRALPH Ralph. She shakes his hand. \nPAMELA Pamela. \nRALPH Pamela. \nPAMELA You're the only American I have ever liked, Ralph. Ralph is chuffed to bits. \nRALPH May I ask why? \nPAMELA No. Now take this-- She hands him the piece of Beverly Hills Hotel stationery with her notes on. \nRALPH \n(READING) Albert Einstein, Van Gogh, Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo-- \n(BEAT) What is this? \nPAMELA They all had difficulties. Jane can do anything that anyone else can do, do you understand? Ralph looks at her in awe. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Look at the bottom. \nRALPH Walt Disney! \nPAMELA Deficiencies in concentration and hyperactive behavior. Explains everything! Pamela turns to leave. \nPamela sits at the table, as Disney carries in a tray with a teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups. These he places on the table and proceeds to pour tea. \nPAMELA Milk. The milk goes in first. He attends to it. \nWALT I remember. \nPAMELA And whiskey. I'll have whiskey in mine. Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. She takes it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup. \nWALT \n(SURPRISED) Oh. \n(BEAT) Oh well, when in Rome! He pours a slug into his tea too. \nPAMELA You've come to change my mind. To beat me into submission. \nWALT No, I've come because you misjudge me. \nPAMELA How do I misjudge you? \nWALT You look at me and you see some kind of Hollywood King Midas. \n(MORE) \nWALT (CONT'D) You think I've built an empire and that I want to use your Mary Poppins as just another brick in my kingdom. You think I see her with a carpetbag full of greenbacks. \nPAMELA And don't you? \nWALT If that was all it was would I have pursued an cranky, stubborn dame like you for twenty years? I'd've have saved myself an ulcer! \n(BEAT) No, you expected me to disappoint you and so you made sure I did. You see, I think life disappoints you, Mrs Travers. I think it's done that a lot. Maybe Mary Poppins is the only person in your life who hasn't. \nPAMELA Mary Poppins isn't real. \nWALT Oh, no, that's not true. She's real as can be to my daughter's and to thousands of other children-- adults too. She's been there as a nighttime comfort to a heck of a lot of people. \nPAMELA Well, Where is she when I need her? Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins and who should be standing there but Walt Disney! He laughs. \nWALT Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped this would be a magical experience for you, for all of us. But I let you down-- and in doing so, I've broken a twenty year old promise to my girls. \n(BEAT) I've been wracking my brains, trying to figure out why this has been so hard for you and I-- \n(BEAT) You see, I have my own Mr Banks. Mine had a moustache. \nPAMELA Ah! Not true then that Disney created man in his own image? \nWALT But it is true that you created yourself in someone else's yes? She doesn't answer. Walt takes mouthful of laced tea and coughs a little. \nWALT (CONT'D) Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs Travers? Do you know Missouri at all? \nPAMELA Can't say I do and as I have no plans to ever set foot on American soil again I'm afraid I never will. \nWALT It's mighty cold there in the winters. Bitter. Walt stops talking, catches himself, looks away and then gives in. His enthusiasm completely disappears and he's suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela. \nWALT (CONT'D) (it pours out) My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a newspaper delivery route there. Thousand papers. Twice daily. Morning and evening edition. Elias, he was a tough businessman. A save- a-penny anywhere you can type of fella so he wouldn't employ any delivery boys, he just used me and my big brother Roy. I was eight then-- eight years old. \n(BEAT) Like I said, those winters were harsh and old Elias didn't believe in new shoes until the old ones were worn right through so-- \n(BEAT) Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow would be up to here-- He gestures to his knees. \nWALT (CONT'D) You'd push through it like wading through molasses. \n(MORE) \nWALT (CONT'D) And the cold and the wet would be seeping through the shoes and the skin would be raw and peeling from our faces-- and sometimes I'd find myself sunk down in the snow, waking up, cuz I must've passed out for a moment-- I dunno. Then school, too cold to figure out an equation. And back into the snow so by the time we got home it'd be just getting dark, and every part of you would sting like crazy as it slowly came back to life in the warmth. My mother would feed us dinner and then it'd be time to go out again for the evening edition. \n(BEAT) Best be quick Walt, best be quick or poppa's gonna show you the buckle end again boy. Walt smiles at Pamela, sips his tea. \nWALT (CONT'D) Now, I don't tell you all this to make you sad Mrs Travers, I don't. I love my life - it's a miracle. And I loved my daddy, boy I loved him. But, there isn't a day goes by where I don't think of that little boy in the snow and old Elias with his fist and strap and I'm just so tired-- I'm tired of remembering it that way. Aren't you tired Mrs Travers? We all have our tales but don't you want to find a way to finish the story? Let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by a past? \n(BEAT) It's not the children she comes to save. It's their father. \n(BEAT) It's your father--? \n(BEAT) Travers Goff. \nPAMELA I don't know what you think you know about me Walter-- \nWALT You must've loved and admired him a lot to take his name-- \nDIARMUID Do you have a title? \nPAMELA Mary Poppins in the Kitchen. \nDIARMUID Wonderful. Should we start talking about the film rights? Pamela narrows her eyes at him. \nPAMELA NEVER again. \nDIARMUID Okay. \n(BEAT) Now, tell me, Have you got your tiara for the premiere? \nPAMELA Oh, I'm not going. \nDIARMUID Why not? \nPAMELA Hollywood premieres are not for old trout like me. Anyway, it's not \nCONVENIENT-- \nDIARMUID He hasn't invited you, has he? Pamela doesn't reply. \nDIARMUID (CONT'D) Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for that. \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nPamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle her cabin baggage into an overhead locker. The same flight attendant from the top of the film appears. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Can I help you? \nPAMELA I'm perfectly capable thank you. The flight attendant recognizes her with something akin to horror. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Suit yourself-- ma'am. \nPAMELA \n(CHEERY) I shall! \nCAPTAIN (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome aboard this flight to Los Angeles. Just a few announcements before we begin our taxi for takeoff-- Pamela takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at the tarmac. She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead. \nINT. DISNEY STUDIOS - OUTER OFFICE - DAY \nWalt enters the outer office walking briskly towards his own office. \nWALT Morning Dolly. Dolly opens her mouth to speak but he's already past and \nAPPROACHING-- \nTOMMIE'S DESK Tommie sits, arms crossed and stares, half bemused at Walt. \nWALT (CONT'D) What? Tommie nods toward his office. Pamela is sitting in a chair, back to them. \nPAMELA Me again! \nINT. DISNEY OFFICE - DAY \nWalt semi-recovers as quickly as possible and enters his office. \nWALT Mrs Travers! How wonderful to see you. What brings you to-- \nPAMELA I'm here for my premiere. \nWALT Great! \nPAMELA I didn't receive my invitation, but I just assumed the American postal service had fallen down on the job as per usual. She smiles sweetly. \nWALT I'll have a-- uh, replacement sent to your hotel right away. \nPAMELA That's very kind, Mr Disney. I knew you wouldn't have forgotten me. \nWALT Pam, how could I? \nPAMELA How indeed? You did, after all, assure me that I wouldn't be disappointed. \nINT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY \nThe porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother hovering for a tip. Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous stuffed Mickey Mouse. \nPAMELA \n", "test1_input": "Pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car. She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in- car bar. \nPAMELA \n(TO HERSELF) Absurd. Ralph looks at her in the rearview. \nRALPH You okay back there Mrs P.L. Travers? \nPAMELA It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs-- Oh, it's so hot. \nRALPH No problemo! We got a brand new air conditioning system, Missus; cool you right down in no time. Just about make you feel like you're in good old Engerland again! Things they can put in cars these days-- (he shakes his head in \nAMAZEMENT) Gosh almighty. Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around, finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph's natter. \nRALPH (CONT'D) (happy as a clam) No problemo. \nEXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY \nWith its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun. The limo glides into the forecourt. \nINT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY \nA porter opens the door to Pamela's suite and places her belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway. \nPORTER Would you like me to unpack for you ma'am? \nPAMELA Unpack? \nPORTER To take your items from their cases and hang them in the wardrobe ma'am. \nPAMELA Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments I suggest you take employment in a launderette. The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Yes? His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She closes the door on him. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Odd. She turns and for the first time takes in-- \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Oh my. --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across every surface of the room. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Oh no, no, no. Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald, Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. Nope. \nBIGGER! Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands before an enormous wave of panic washes over her. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) (muttering to the pears) This won't do. She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight-- \nEXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY \n--Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. From their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new home. The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre. A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few skinny chickens strut about the porch. \nTRAVERS A palace! Complete with mighty steed. \nGINTY And chickens. \nMARGARET \nOH-- Travers puts an arm around her shoulder. \nTRAVERS We'll build beautiful memories here my angel. Margaret offers him a trusting smile. \nMARGARET Yes. Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards their new home. The chickens scatter. \nTRAVERS (in the distance) --in this house you get to share a bedroom! Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply nothing but barren land and red dust for miles. \nEXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - DAY \nUNDERWATER SPLOSH! A green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then another SPLOSH! We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free swimming pool. \nINT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUS \nPAMELA Good riddance. She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) \n(TO HERSELF) Well, first things first. She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in a closet. She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the entire bed. Imagine it. Nope. BIGGER! \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Good Lord. Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the floor, facing the wall. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) \n(TO MICKEY) And you can stay there until you learn the art of subtlety. Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. She takes from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night stand, followed by another bottle and another and another. The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up, the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down an existing painting and replaces it with her own image. \n", "test1_true": "PAMELA (CONT'D) \n(SATISFIED) Yes. (answering an imaginary \nQUESTION) Well, no, I don't suppose I do mind. She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as an ugly snort. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Now, really! Flatterer! (then scolding herself) Silly girl. She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the TV bursts into life. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Oh! She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on. A housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is the greatest thing ever invented. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Soap for the brains. She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) on The Wonderful World of Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow-- \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Well, well-- There you are. \nCU: TV SCREEN Walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out. \nWALT Don't worry! There's nothing wrong with your television set. This is a pixie bell, the sound is much too high for human ears. Tinkerbell flies into shot. \nWALT (CONT'D) Oh there you are Tink! She covers Walt in fairy dust. \nWALT (CONT'D) \n(LAUGHING) Hey! Get that stuff off of me! \n(TO AUDIENCE) You know, a little sprinkling of fairy dust can make you fly! Pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and switches him off. \nPAMELA Off! That's how we deal with you. \nEXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL \nA tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door. \nINT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT \nPamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there. The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her bed. \nEXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING \nPamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately, not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car and rush round to open the passenger door. \nRALPH Good morning Mrs! \nPAMELA It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do I bother? We're just not going to get it right are we? \nRALPH Hm? \nPAMELA Will it be the same driver every day? \nRALPH (oblivious to her tone) Yes ma'am! I'm all yours. \n(BEAT) Sun came out again! \nPAMELA You say it like you're surprised. Like the sun is particular about whom it appears for. It seems you think that I am responsible for it's miraculous dawning every day. For goodness sake, it's California! \nRALPH It certainly is! He gestures for her to get in. \nRALPH (CONT'D) (trying a British accent) Madame. Pamela grimaces. \nINT. LIMOSINE - CONTINUOUS \nPamela tucks her legs in and folds her hands into her lap. Ralph climbs into the driver's seat. \nPAMELA (as much to herself as \nRALPH) I would so much rather be accountable for the rain. \nRALPH Oh, that's sad. \nPAMELA Sad is entirely the wrong emotion. I shan't bother explaining why; \nIT'LL SIMPLY (she makes gesture for flying over his head) Zip! \nRALPH Okey dokey. \nPAMELA The rain brings life! \nRALPH So does the sun. \n", "test2_input": "GINTY \n(LAUGHING) That's a made up word! \nBIDDY Really?! \nGINTY Not the aunt! \n(BEAT) Quick! Catch her before she flies away on the-- \nTRAVERS/GINTY East Wind! Travers throws his jacket to the ground and begins to chase the hen, tearing through the clean sheets and treading them into the ground. \nMARGARET Oh! \nTRAVERS I'll wash them again my love! Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs. The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in, Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it back inside - out of sight, out of mind. \nTRAVERS (CONT'D) Go Sergeant Ginty! Fell the beast! Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and scarpers. It's chaos. Travers, the girls, the dog and the evasive hen running into each other, falling over each other, cursing and laughing. \nGINTY Aunt Ellie! \nTRAVERS Oh she's a foul fowl! \nINT. TRAVER'S BEDROOM/CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - EVENING \nBiddy and Moya sleep but Ginty is awake, the hen snuggled firmly under her arm. She can hear the tense voices of her parents. \nMARGARET --darling, it's just that um-- a \nLITTLE CONCERNED-- \nTRAVERS --Meg sweet, I had a throat scratch- \nMARGARET --the bank is getting you down again? Perhaps my sister-- \nTRAVERS God no! No. I can endure. I will endure. For the girl's sake-- Just, please-- not Ellie. \nMARGARET Oh my dear-- Travers weeps and Ginty closes her eyes, buries her little face in the hens feathers. \nGINTY \n(WHISPERING) Foul fowl. \nINT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT \nPamela sits up in bed - leaning back into the open arms of Mickey Mouse - applying face cream, then hand cream, her face is screwed into a twist of unhappiness. \nEXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - NIGHT \nDisney sits on Pamela's bench, deep in contemplation. Piano music tinkles from somewhere in the building and then a \nVOICE-- \nDICK All around the cathedral the saints and apostles look down as she sells her wares Walt is dragged from his thoughts and gets up to follow the sound. \nDICK (CONT'D) Although you can't see it you know they are smiling Each time someone shows that he \nCARES-- \nINT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK \nWalt walks towards the music room, visibly moved by the song, a cough rattling in his throat. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - NIGHT \nAlso in lamplight, Dick Sherman sits at his piano. Bob asleep on a couch in the corner. Walt pushes the door open, Dick knows he's there but keeps tinkling away. \nDICK Though her words are simple and few listen, listen, she's calling to \nYOU-- \"Feed the birds, tuppence a bag tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag.\" \nWALT That'll work. Dick nods, still playing. Walt makes his way to the piano, sighs, sits next to Dick on the stool. \nWALT (CONT'D) She's going to say no isn't she? \n(BEAT) Woman's a conundrum. Dick stops playing and flicks to a new page of sheet music. \nDICK A man has dreams of walking with \nGIANTS To carve his niche in the edifice \n", "test2_true": "(SINGING) Before the mortar of his zeal Has a chance to congeal The cup is dashed from his lips The flame is snuffed aborning He's brought to rack and ruin in \nHIS PRIME-- Walt laughs out loud, he sings with Dick reading the lyrics from the music sheet. \nWALT & DICK My world was calm, well ordered, \nEXEMPLARY Then came this person, with chaos in her wake And now my life's ambitions go with one fell blow It's quite a bitter pill to take. \nWALT Inspired by someone we know? \nDICK \n(FEIGNING INNOCENCE) You'd have to ask Bob. The men smile, bittersweet. \nDICK (CONT'D) She might surprise us all. \nWALT She won't. \nDICK You don't know that. \nWALT I do. I know it, I know it only too well. \n(BEAT) I've fought this battle from her side. Pat Powers, he wanted the mouse and I didn't have a bean back then. Dick raises his eyebrows. \nWALT (CONT'D) He was this big terrifying New York producer and I was just a kid from Missouri with a sketch of Mickey but-- it woulda' killed me to give him up. Walt peers down at the sleeping Bob. \nWALT (CONT'D) Honest to god killed me. That mouse, he's family. \n(BEAT) Go home. Walt leaves the room. \nEXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - NIGHT \nPamela sits by the pool, arms clasped around her, looking at the stars. The pink and green of the hotel shimmers in the water making it look like a chalk painting. \nTRAVERS (V.O.) The world is an illusion Ginty. \nEXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - LATE AFTERNOON \nGinty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped around her body, face to the sky. The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last deafening chorus of the birds. Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened. His shirtsleeves are marked with sweat. His face is a study of something close to despair. He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of greeting. \nTRAVERS Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick! Pray tell me, what are you concentrating so hard on? \nGINTY I am laying eggs! \nTRAVERS Really!? Fabulous! \nGINTY Today I am a hen. \nTRAVERS Indeed! I can see the feathers sprouting as we speak! Margaret steps out onto the veranda, takes one look at her husband and knows he is drunk. \nMARGARET Helen Goff, would you lay the table for supper please? \nGINTY I'm not Helen! \nTRAVERS \n(OVER) She can't possibly lay a table; she's busy laying eggs! \nMARGARET I need-- (help.) \nTRAVERS She's laying! \nMARGARET (her face contorts in \nPAIN) I'm sorry! She goes back indoors and slams the door behind her. Ginty gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm. He swallows hard, eyes welling. \nTRAVERS (urgent, his voice \nBREAKING) Don't you ever stop dreaming Ginty my love. You can be anyone you want to be. Anyone. \nGINTY I want to be like you. \nTRAVERS Don't. \n(HE CHOKES) Don't leave yourself always searching for-- something-- He coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the porch. Ginty is unnerved by her Travers' demeanor, she creeps around to the side of the house where she watches her father appears in the window of the washroom. She doesn't know what to do as he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing. \nOMITTED \n", "test3_input": "EXT. KING ARTHUR'S CAROUSEL - DISNEYLAND - DAY \nThe carousel slows to a halt and a herd of excited children climb down from the horses and disappear into the park. \nWALT Mrs Travers, I would be honoured if you would ride Jingles. She's Mrs Disney's favourite horse. He escorts Pamela to a beautiful white horse, roses on it's bridal. \nPAMELA No thank you. I'm happy to watch. \nWALT No greater joy than that seen through the eyes of a child. Pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel. \nWALT (CONT'D) There's a child in us all. \nPAMELA Maybe in you Mister Disney, but certainly not I. \nWALT Get on the horse Pamela! Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse. \nWALT (CONT'D) When we first met, you said to me `they're family.' \nPAMELA I said what? \nWALT Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're family. \n(BEAT) The boys have had an idea for your Mister Banks. I think it'll make you happy. \nPAMELA You brought me all the way out here to tell me that? \nWALT No. I brought you all the way out here for monetary gain. Had a wager with the boys that I couldn't get you on a ride. I win! He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride controller and off they go! Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney spilling out. The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars. \nWALT (CONT'D) Yah! \nINT. TRAVER'S BEDROOM - ALLORA - DAY \nTravers has a violent coughing fit, he looks to his hand, disturbed to see blood there. He grimaces at Ellie who has her back to him as she folds clothes, a look of deep satisfaction on her face. \nELLIE Well begun, is half done! His face softens as his hazy gaze falls upon Ginty, outside the window, sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close with tiredness. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nAll the tables have been pushed to the walls, Don is just pushing the last one away as Pamela comes in, followed by Dolly with the tray carrying Pamela's tea. \nDON Good morning Mrs Travers! She looks at the new arrangement of the room. \nPAMELA What horrors have you in store for my beautiful characters today, hm? Bob clenches a fist but Dick gives him a look that says: keep calm. \nDON Now, Mrs Travers you sit here. He ushers her to a chair facing the centre of the room. He hands pages to Bob and pages to Dolly. Don and Dolly drop to their knees so that they are half the height of Bob. Pamela raises an eyebrow. \nDON (CONT'D) We thought about what you said Mrs Travers and Mr Banks isn't cruel. He isn't. We've got a new ending for the film. Oh god, I hope you like it. Bob pulls a kite out from behind his back. \nDON (CONT'D) \n(AS MICHAEL) Michael says, \"He mended it! It's wonderful!\" \nDOLLY \n(AS JANE) However did you manage it? \nPAMELA \n(TO HERSELF) He mended it? Dick strikes a chord on the piano. \nDICK \n(SINGING) With tuppence for paper and strings You can have your own set of wings With your feet on the ground You're a bird in flight with your fist holding tight To the string of your kite Oh oh oh oh Bob takes the hands of Don and Dolly and he dances around with them (awkwardly as they are still on their knees and Bob has a limp.) Pamela's eyes on the fixed kite. \nDICK & BOB Let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height Let's go fly a kite and send it \nSOARING Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh let's go fly a kite Don notices Pamela's foot tapping, he stands up. \nDON And then Mrs Banks goes to fetch her suffragettes ribbon. \nDOLLY (as Mrs Banks) \"A proper kite needs a proper tail don't you think?!\" Don drops to his knees again. \nBOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY Let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height Is Pamela humming too?! \nBOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY (CONT'D) Let's go fly a kite and send it \nSOARING Don bows to Pamela puts his hand out to her and to his surprise, she accepts and they begin to waltz.

Walt spins around. \nDOLLY (CONT'D) I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just she-- she's dancing! Mrs Travers. She's dancing with Don! He cracks a great big smile. \nDICK (V.O.) With your fist holding tight To the string of your kite \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nAs before. \nBOB/DICK/DON/PAMELA Oh Oh Oh Oh Let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height Let's go fly a kite and send it \nSOARING Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh let's go fly a kite! They all collapse in a heap, exhausted and thrilled. \nPAMELA Well. \nBOB Well? \nPAMELA Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love it! Dick punches the air. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) Though proper English would be `Let us go and fly a kite.' Bob glares at her. \nPAMELA (CONT'D) But I might be willing to overlook that. \nBOB Did we get that on tape? Everybody sighs with relief and Pamela looks to the caricature of Mr Banks with deep warmth. \nINT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - EVENING \nGinty sits with her father, he's a shadow of his former self, extremely ill. The shaking has stopped, his lips are parched and blueish. \nTRAVERS Look at you-- all ship shape. Travers reaches up a shaking hand and musses up Ginty's perfectly plaited hair. \nGINTY I re-wrote the poem father. Travers doesn't respond. Ginty reaches into her pocket, takes out tuppence. \nGINTY (CONT'D) The aunt gave me tuppence. She shows it to him in her open palm. \nGINTY (CONT'D) Shall I buy you something father? \nTRAVERS \n(BARELY AUDIBLE) \nPEARS-- \nINT.

CHARLENE Oh god, oh god... you gotta get me to the hospital... contractions... 
BERNIE Shelly, please help her. That's my grandson... 
SHELLY Hey, why don't we all break out the champagne? Lootz is about to become a granddaddy. (walks over to her) How you doin' there, sweetheart? Must hurt like crap, huh? 
CHARLENE (nods) Hurts so bad... 
SHELLY Yeah? 
Suddenly Shelly kicks Charlene in the belly! WHAM! She screeches out. 
NATALIE Oh God... 
BERNIE Jesus NOOOOO!!! 
Even Shelly's goons can't believe what they've just witnessed. Larry is aghast. Bernie rushes Shelly, starts raining blows on him. Shelly swats him off. He drops down next to the squirming girl, rips her sweater and blouse up over her stomach... 
...to reveal a mound of fake padding. He tears the padding away from her, throws it at Bernie. 
SHELLY Here! It's a fuckin' boy. Anyone got a cigar? 
The muscle start laughing it up. Relief. Larry emits a nervous giggle. Natalie's jaw hits the floor. Bernie takes a step back. He's about to go into serious shock. Charlene curls over, sobbing. 
SHELLY (to Bernie) You sure you still want to be good for it? Because if you want to change your mind, I don't blame you. 
Bernie looks over at Mikey. He stares up at his father, trembling. 
MIKEY I'll make it up to you, Pop, I swear... 
Bernie holds his son's gaze for a beat. He's almost tempted to... He just shrugs and nods at Shelly. 
BERNIE It's on me. 
SHELLY (shakes his head) That's the worst fucking call you ever made in your life. 
ON NATALIE at that moment. We can tell she agrees with Shelly... but thinks all the more of Bernie for it. That might even be love in her eyes. 
Shelly snatches his baseball bat up off the floor. Walks over to Mikey, and brings it down full force, pulverizing Mikey's left kneecap. Oh man, the scream... 
BERNIE What are you doing?! I thought we had -- 
SHELLY 150 G's buys their lives. This is just a little slap on the wrist to remember me by. 
Natalie turns her head. She's about to throw up. Larry watches, unflinchingly. Charlene is making with some serious pleading now. 
CHARLENE Oh god... it wasn't my idea. 
Shelly steps up to Charlene, tapping the base of the bat in the palm of his hand. He smiles reassuringly at her. 
SHELLY You know, motherhood is a beautiful thing. This... you made a mockery out of it. Maybe you'll get to experience it for real one day. 
CHARLENE (nods, sobbing) I want... to be a mother... please don't hurt me... 
SHELLY I'm not going to hurt you. 
Shelly turns his back on her. Charlene starts sobbing relief. They're not going to hurt her. It's going to be all right. Wrong. Shelly throws the bat to Lou. The heavy steps up to the plate (as we RACK FOCUS to Shelly walking away) -- CRUNCH!!! followed by the girl's SHRIEKS. Natalie buries her head in Bernie's shoulder. 
SHELLY (to Tony and Lou) Get 'em outta here. You ever see them in this joint again, kill 'em. 
SHELLY (to Bernie and Natalie) You two, you're still on shift. 
Shelly catches Larry's eye: I hope you were taking notes.

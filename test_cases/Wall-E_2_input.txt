AUTO Not possible. 
CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN) That's right! The plant! Oh, you want it? Come and get it, Blinky! 
AUTO No. 
INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME 
The Captain   hovers in front of Eve's memory screen. It projects   a STILL IMAGE OF WALL-E HOLDING THE PLANT. The Captain   blocks the camera's view of Wall-E. Pretends to   be holding the projected plant himself. 
CAPTAIN Ha ha! 
HEARS AUTO coming. Turns off the vid-com. 
Yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall. The room goes dark again. 
CLOSE ON CEILING 
The aperture opens. Auto lowers into the dark. Cautiously searches the empty room... 
AUTO Captain? Captain...? 
ON AUTO'S POV 
PANS across the portraits of other captains... ...past our present Captain... ...The eyes in the portrait dart nervously... -- wait a minute. 
The Captain lunges at him. Grabs Auto by the steering wheel. Hangs onto it like Cap'n Ahab in a gale. His lower extremities of no use. 
AUTO Let go. Let go. 
Auto panics. Zips back up through the hole in the ceiling. The Captain gets stuck between floors... 
CAPTAIN What too heavy for ya, huh?! 
UP ON THE BRIDGE 
...Auto tries to pull free. The Captain won't let go. Auto ends up yanking him through. The Captain rides Auto like a bucking bronco. Auto swings violently back and forth. 
CAPTAIN You're not getting away from me, one-eye! -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?! 
Gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube. Sees the Captain fighting Auto. Charges at the Captain... 
...who kicks him straight out the window... 
ON LIDO DECK 
Gopher plummets... ...his SHADOW growing over the POOL... ...and smashes in a heap on the cement. The end. 
ON WALL-E AND EVE 
We PAN OVER the smoking wreckage of the stewards. The massage-bot floats above it all. Pants like a wild beast. One steward still twitches. The massage-bot crushes him with one blow. 
Eve grabs Wall-E and the plant. They take off for the Concourse Level. M-O and the Rejects follow behind. 
ON THE BRIDGE 
CAPTAIN That's it!...A little closer! Must..press...button. 
The Captain reaches his one free hand out for... ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON. 
CAPTAIN Gotcha! Ha ha! 
His hand slams down hard on it. KLAXONS sound all over the ship.

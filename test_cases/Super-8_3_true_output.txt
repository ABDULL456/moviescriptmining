JACK ... It was an accident. It was an accident. 
Jack glances at him. A small nod of forgiveness and gratitude. Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it. 
INT. SHED - NIGHT 
Joe begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE. 
INT. CEMETERY SHED HOLE - NIGHT 
Joe lands on the bottom. Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Cary climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above him. Now Cry lands too. There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO. Joe's mind races about which way to go. 
CARY Joe, I don't understand-- 
We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING -- like something far off, but MECHANICAL. Then: 
JOE Shhh. This way. 
They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL TUNNEL, TWENTY FEET TALL -- 
INT. TUNNEL #1 (W/FURNIURE) - NIGHT 
We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT. 
They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING ROOM. They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT THROUGH A HOUSE. They continue, coming to an INTERSECTION -- where a NEW TUNNEL branches off. 
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT 
There's DIM LIGHT from up ahead, where the tunnel BENDS. The RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe and Cary slowly move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and amazes them all at once. 
IT'S A HUNDRED-FOOT DIAMETER, FORTY-FOOT TALL UNDERGROUND SPACE, FILLED WITH A MECHANICAL MARVEL -- A MASSIVE, BIZARRE CONTRAPTION COMBINING THOUSANDS OF MECHANICAL PIECES, FROM THE MISSING MICROWAVES, CAR ENGINES, ANTENNAS, AND COUNTLESS OTHER DEVICES -- WIRES AND CABLES HANG AND CONNECT EVERYWHERE, ALL LEADING TO THE DIRT CEILING, HEADING UP, TO SOMEWHERE ABOVE GROUND. THE THICK-WITH-FUMES SPACE CHUGS AND HUMS WITH A SLOWLY INCREASING PITCH, AS IT IT'S WARMING UP, GETTING READY TO FINALLY, ACTUALLY WORK. 
They cross to the other side. Cary bumps into a HANGING SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt. 
CARY It's Sheriff Pruitt. 
JOE I know. Cary look. 
Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other TUNNELS are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the space in disbelief. 
CARY What is this? 
JOE We're under the water tower. 
Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt. Cary looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND DANGLING CABLES, AT THE OTHER END OF THIS UNDERGROUND EXPERIMENT, IS THE CREATURE. HUNCHED OVER. BACK TO THE BOYS. AND IT'S SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING. IT MOVES A BIT: WE SEE IT'S A HUMAN LEG. Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didn't need to stay quiet. In a panicked WHISPER: 
CARY It's eating a person. 
Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING LIFELESS FROM THEIR FEET, WRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF THIN SHELLAC. TIGHT ON JOE as he sees, among them, ALICE. His heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples. Cary sees her too -- 
JOE She's here. We're going to use your firecrackers. 
CARY I don't think it's going to hurt it, Joe. 
JOE There are other tunnels. 
CARY So? 
JOE I need you to make noise. Lots of it, right here, in two minutes. Make it loud and make it last-- gimme some sparklers. 
CARY (goes through his bag) -- why-- what are you gonna do--? 
JOE (takes SPARKLERS and a LIGHTER from Cary) Make sure you're gone by the time it blows: you can't be here, you gotta run. 
CARY Where are you going? 
But Joe's already gone. Stay with Cary, who opens his backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES, glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view -- 
INT. TUNNEL #3 - NIGHT 
MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now. Joe runs, looking for another way into the creature's massive space -- he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it -- he disappears down the tunnel -- 
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT 
Cary's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space. 
INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT 
Joe races down the dirt tunnel, the SOUND OF THE MECHANICAL RUMBLING -- and its INCREASING PITCH -- getting LOUDER. The SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows -- peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER SIDE of the space. He sees the creature -- then looks across to the lifeless body of Alice. His heart sinks. 
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT

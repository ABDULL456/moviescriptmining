NICK What kind of beer would you like? 
LINDA (laughing) I don't know. 
NICK (to Merle) Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life. 
NICK takes off. LINDA sits down at a table and MERLE goes to the cooler to get a Miller's. He gropes around in the tub, finds one and pops the tab. Suddenly he notices that NICK has crossed to the SAD-LOOKING GIRL by the wall. He has stopped in front of her and is asking her something. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL gives a blush, gets out of her chair and NICK takes her in his arms and begins to dance. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL looks transformed. She begins chattering and laughing. 
MERLE crosses back to LINDA and gives her the beer. As he pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and nearly loses his balance. He is very drunk. 
MERLE Sorry. 
LINDA (laughs) It's okay, Merle. 
NICK swings by with the SAD-LOOKING GIRL and waves. 
MERLE (catching Linda's expression) I guess you like Nick. 
LINDA (nods) Yes. 
MERLE doesn't say anything for a moment. He seems to be trying to contain a floodtide of emotion. 
MERLE Fuckin' Nick... (clears his throat) Fuckin' Nick... gives. (he nods, bangs his fist on the table) Gives. Fuckin' Nick gives. 
INT. V.F.W. POST - COATROOM - NIGHT 
The rack is still jammed with COUPLES but the laughing and giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing and low moans. What light there is comes from the colored glass ball revolving above the dance floor, where the MUSIC is now playing sweet and low. 
The front door comes open and a U.S. Army SERGEANT steps into the darkened hallway. The man wears his dress green uniform. On his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are brightly polished. 
SERGEANT Pow! 
The SERGEANT gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance floor. 
INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLE AREA - NIGHT 
The SERGEANT passes between groups of celebrating GUESTS, plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at the end of one of the white trestle tables.

ALBERT gives his Tarzan cry, suddenly picks his GIRL off her feet and marches around holding her above his head. 
GIRL Albert, what are you doing... Albert! 
INT. V.F.W. POST DANCE FLOOR - ANOTHER LOCATION - NIGHT 
VINCE and JOHN are standing together. VINCE is going bananas because his girl, MARSHA, is dancing too close to FRED. 
VINCE Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass! 
JOHN Oh, well... 
VINCE Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now. 
VINCE marches up and taps FRED on the shoulder. FRED releases MARSHA. MARSHA waits, one hand on her hip, while the two of them exchange words. VINCE turns MARSHA, points to her ass. FRED turns MARSHA, pints to the small of her back. VINCE is hopping up and down now. So is FRED. MARSHA, who is getting bored, points to the door. VINCE and FRED bang out. As soon as they have gone MARSHA is taken by someone else who puts his hand right back where FRED had it.

NICK, SAL and MERLE are standing together, looking at the SERGEANT. 
MERLE Nick, he just came back. 
NICK From Nam? 
MERLE Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son! 
MERLE gestures with his head. NICK and SAL cross with him to the SERGEANT. 
MERLE (CONT'D) We, ah... We're going too. 
The SERGEANT looks at them and delivers a big, blank smile. 
SERGEANT Pow! 
MERLE What? 
The SERGEANT keeps smiling. 
MERLE (CONT'D) (to Nick) What'd he say? 
NICK Pow. 
MERLE Pow?

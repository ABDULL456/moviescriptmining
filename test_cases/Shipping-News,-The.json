{"train": "THE SHIPPING NEWS \nRon Bass Third Draft Rewrite February 23, 1999 \nPrevious Drafts By: Laura Jones Beth Henley \nINT. LAUNDROMAT, MOCKINGBURG, NEW YORK - NIGHT \nGlaring fluorescence, trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes, empty Coke machine flashing all lights orange. Only two dryers are humming. It's very late. Keep PANNING to... \n...a wiry, gimlet-eyed WOMAN, furtively removing crumpled newspapers from a dryer. She flattens and folds them meticulously, her glance darting angrily everywhere. Top secret mission. \n...a natty little black man. PARTRIDGE has spread a late supper on a neat cloth atop a dryer. Small cold fowl. Brie, baguette, olives. Bottle of red. An air of competence, of indomitable upbeatness. He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she were normal. More curious about... \n...a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as if cramming for life's midterm exam. Thoughtful. Circles one, slowly. Set out on QUOYLE's dryer are one Snickers bar and four empty snickers wrappers. His version of cold supper. He reaches for the candy, but seeing it's the last one, he... \n...rises. Goes to the candy machine. Drops in his 65 cents, hits the button. The Snickers starts to fall, but gets caught in the mechanism at the last moment. Quoyle blinks dully. One more retelling of the story of his life. He BANGS the machine half- heartedly. Nope. Shakes it with his shambling strength. Nada. POUNDS the coin return button. Hat trick. He empties his pocket. Studies the results. Not enough. And without so much as a sigh... \n...he ambles back to his dryer. Starts to unwrap the last Snickers. Partridge taking this all in. But Mata Hari of the Neat Newspapers goes to the candy machine, KICKS it violently. Out fall the Snickers and the 65 cents. She scoops up both, turns in a single motion to... \n...GLARE death at the enemy. Quoyle opens his mouth to comment. But. Doesn't. Resumes unwrapping his supper, as... \n...his dryer STOPS. He pops it open. Stares in. Blinks. Suddenly YANKS a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floor to reveal they have been... \n...STAINED streaky BLUE by a cheap pen, quietly melting amid the pile. This slips beneath even Quoyle's expectation level. The big, soft face is pitifully, yes, even adorably, devastated. \nQUOYLE (a murmur) Ruined. \nAnd to the bystander.     This seems a comment on more than shirts. \nPARTRIDGE (softly) Nah. Rub the ink with hot salt and talcum powder. \nQuoyle's head WHIPS around.     As if he thought he was alone. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) If you're shocked when someone aims kindness your way. That oughta tell you somethin' about yourself. \nWatches the little guy's undemanding smile. \nQUOYLE (V.O., just staring) Then again. If you're that kinda guy. It don't. \nPARTRIDGE And put a cuppa bleach in, next time through. \nAs Quoyle gazes at his benefactor, the woman sneaks up, SNATCHES his Help Wanted ads. Races them over to her dryer. As the boys watch, she shoves them in, starts the machine with Quoyle's coins, and glares fiercely back at us. A mother bear protecting her cubs. Partridge chuckles. Holds out his hand... \nPARTRIDGE Partridge. \nQuoyle glances at the little man's cold fowl supper. \nQUOYLE Uh.   No thanks. \nPARTRIDGE It's my name. \nOh. \nINT. MOCKINGBURG RECORD CITY ROOM - DAY \nShabby one-floor newspaper. Old equipment, listless personnel, stale you can smell from here. Only guy working is Partridge, who is laying out the front page, and glances up to see across the floor... \n...Quoyle enter in his best suit. It is also his worst suit. Partridge points to the only enclosed office, and gives his buddy a hearty thumbs-up. Quoyle nods, his smile a rictus, his eyes a glaze of panic. We see now that he is chewing, somehow. On the way into the office, he snags a doughnut from a paper plate by the coffee. Enters... \nINT. ED PUNCH'S OFFICE - DAY \n...ED PUNCH, managing editor, looks up from a reverie with a startled expression. He wears really thick glasses which MAGNIFY his eyes, giving him a frightening aspect. \nPUNCH \nQuoyle?     You're early. \nFrom the rear, we see Quoyle can barely squeeze himself into the chair. \nPUNCH I don't like that. \nAll the change SPILLS out of Quoyle's pockets, and CLATTERS onto the wood floor, ROLLING interminably, as Quoyle fidgets. \nPUNCH Partridge says you're not as dumb as you look. \nREVERSE ANGLE now to see Quoyle's face.        The neat moustache of powdered sugar. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) How could I be? \nAnd takes a healthy bite from what's left of the doughnut. \nPUNCH Anyway, that's why I'm takin' a chance on you. Partridge said he'd re-write whatever of your stuff. Stay late... \nQuoyle nods, dumbly.     Knows this. \nPUNCH We're a family paper. Upbeat stories with a community slant. Self-help stuff: Are You a Break- fast Alcoholic?...Guide to Getting Dumped...like that. \nQuoyle nods bigger. Like he gets it.         Punch shoves an antique tape recorder across the table. \nPUNCH City Planning Board meeting at two- thirty. Three hunnerd words max. Sink or swim. \nHOLD on Quoyle's eyes.      Recalling... \nFLASHBACK:   EXT. PUBLIC POOL - DAY \n...Quoyle as a fat kid in a baggy bathing suit, being savagely pummeled by his vicious OLDER BROTHER... \nQUOYLE (V.O.) I think my brother said that once. \nBROTHER LARDASS!     SNOTFACE!    FARTBAG! \nBeing pulled off the sniveling Quoyle by a rough hairy man with dead eyes. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) Maybe it was my father. \nPetal naked in near-darkness, moves with authority toward the massive lumpy creature nearly overflowing his bed. Draws the covers back. \nStares. \nPETAL Christ.   I won the lottery. \nClimbs on, the lithe move of a leopardess.         Feeding time. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) It was pretty much like that for a month. \nPetal RIDING in silhouette, with great, violent swoops.            CLOSE on his face, his eyes. Lovelight. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) Somewhere in there. We got married. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nHorrible place. Smoke and bodies. Quoyle alone, carrying his sloshing beer, apologies unheard, toward... \nQUOYLE (V.O.) After that, I had to follow her to see her. \n...the back of Petal, talking to a big guy in a shiny suit. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) Which I know was wrong of me. \nCloser.   Close enough to hear... \nPETAL What do you think? You want to marry me, don't you? \nHOLD on Quoyle's face. The lovelight has never left.          It shines through the shock. As if in apology... \nQUOYLE (V.O.) She didn't know she was pregnant. \nDISSOLVE to... \nINT. PARLOR - DAY \nOne-year-old BUNNY is SCREAMING in a rickety crib festooned with mobiles and bright toys. HEAR Quoyle POUNDING in. He reaches to lift her... \n...WAY UP, starts running around the faded little parlor making cheerful airplane noises, as he DIVES and SWOOPS the shrieking kid, until he... \n...stops. Sniffs. Oh. Gives her a kiss, which doesn't put a dent in the screaming, and flops her down on the diaper table. She is screaming LOUDER. He is fumbling with the diaper, the Baby Wipes, getting a wad of ten or so at once. When... \n...the phone rings. He runs off. Runs back, lifts Bunny, diaper dangling from the tape stuck to her skin, and SNATCHES up the phone, hoping with everything in him that it's... \nPETAL (O.S.) Hey. How do you make an Alabama Slammer? \nHe takes a breath.     Can hear the noise of a rowdy spot.     Country juke box. \nQUOYLE Uh.    Where are y... \nPETAL (O.S.) Alabama.     Hence, the question. \nBunny.   Has stopped screaming. \nQUOYLE Come home.     I'll make you one. \nPETAL (O.S.) That's a swell idea. Now go look on top of the fridge, where I keep the Mr. Boston. I'll wait. \nWhat should he do? He sets Bunny carefully on the floor. She starts screaming again, and he LIFTS her quick, cuddles her. LOPES off, leaving the phone on the floor... \n...RACES back in with the Mr. Boston, a bag of pork rinds, and a pacifier. Something for everyone. As he flips the pages, he murmurs into the phone... \nQUOYLE You okay?     Except for being thirsty? \nShe laughs, almost friendly.      He smiles.   Ever hopeful. \nPETAL (O.S.) I'm busy, I'll see y... \nQUOYLE (reads) Ounce Southern Comfort, ounce Sloe Gin. Ounce Triple Sec. Three ounces o.j.... \nPETAL (O.S.) Got it. \nCLICK. The BUZZ of her disconnect. He glances down at Bunny, working the pacifier. Murmurs to the receiver... \nQUOYLE Me too.    I'll tell Bunny you miss her. \nHang up the phone. Kiss a baby. Eat a pork rind. Slow. As he gazes down on Bunny, we PUSH INTO her face, and MATCH DISSOLVE to... \nINT. BUNNY'S ROOM - NIGHT, FIVE YEARS LATER \n...an ECU of Bunny, now six years old, asleep in the flickering blue light of a nearly-mute TV. Apparently she was watching Sportscenter. PAN the darkened shoebox room. Toys everywhere, in a clutter. A pile of used Barbies, limbs jutting in all directions, waiting for a mass grave. BACK to Bunny, to see... \n...she sleeps in her father's lap. His chin resting on her head, an industrial-size bag of cookies handy. Somewhere, a door OPENS.. \n...SLAMS HARD. Quoyle gently lays Bunny on her bed, and lurches INTO the hall, to see Petal disappearing into her bedroom, and he hurries to stop the door before it slams in his face. \nWhen she turns, she is wasted, feral, and somehow as sexy as ever. Her laser glare. What the fuck do you want? \nQUOYLE There's.    Cold chicken. \nReally? She tears off her jacket, revealing that she has left her shirt somewhere and is down to her bra. She stalks toward him. Straight to the doorway. He flinches. \nPETAL Find yourself. A girlfriend. With what you got down there, you'll do fine. \nQuoyle swallows.     Shakes his head. \nPETAL Only thing can work, here.    Is divorce. \nNo.   No.   Tears of shock pool in his eyes. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) I knew we had our problems. But I never thought I'd hear that word. \nShe shivers with disgust. Walks around in a frustrated circle. Back to his face. Are you sure? What does a girl have to do? And now... \n...the tears are on his face.     She flashes her hardest look.      And yet... \nA beat. \nQUOYLE Should I finish the sawmill piece? \nINT. QUOYLE'S HOUSE - DAY \nQuoyle enters carrying a spray of violets.     HEAR Springer turned up loud. He goes to the parlor to find... \n...MRS. MOOSUP, the babysitter, smoking and swigging a Pepsi. She is mean-ugly with flesh hanging beneath her arms. She stares at him, the flowers. \nMRS. MOOSUP (dry) Mr. Quoyle. You shouldn't have. \nQUOYLE (taking her literally) They're for Petal, Mrs. Moosup. I got something to tell her. \nMRS. MOOSUP Well, that may take awhile. \nUh-oh. \nMRS. MOOSUP She came in at one, packed like crazy. Said she was movin' to Florida with the guy in the red Geo. You know the one. \nHe knows the one. \nMRS. MOOSUP She says you gotta pay my wages for the sittin'. Seven weeks, comes to $3080. 'Preciate a check right n... \nHe is heading toward the hall. \nMRS. MOOSUP Don't bother. She took Bunny with her. \nThat stops him.    Cold.     He turns... \nQUOYLE That's the last thing she'd ev... \nMRS. MOOSUP She was real clear about my check. It's no fun workin' if you don't get paid. \nHe TEARS out, DOWN the hall, INTO Bunny's room... \n...closet open. Empty. No more tangled pile of Barbies.                He surveys the wreckage of his life. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) At least she took her toys.       Wanted her to be happy. \nHe staggers out of the room, down the hall... \nMRS. MOOSUP (O.S.) Mr. Quoyle? I ain't got all day, here! \n...into the kitchen.       Lifts the receiver.    Thinks.     Dials. \nQUOYLE (quietly) Yes.     I need to report a kidnapping. \nAnd straightens his spine.       Just a little. \nQUOYLE Quoyle. Q-U-O-Y-L-...no, Y, then L-E. Yeh, it's my kid. \nHe's still holding the violets.         He notices this.     Sets them down, almost tenderly, in the sink. \nINT. QUOYLE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nQuoyle alone in absolute darkness. Bumping around the house. There's a large bag of something in one hand, maybe M & Ms. But he's not eating. Just murmuring to himself... \nQUOYLE \nWho knows?     Who knows? \nINT. QUOYLE'S PARENTS' HOME, BROOKLYN - DAY \nQuoyle moving in his parents' cluttered parlor like a man underwater. A room as drab, as neglected, as Brooklyn through the window. He stands at a shelf now, staring at a row of framed photos. Lifts one... \n...a BOY of 15, bundled for winter, stands by a frozen pond. Stocky, sullen, something unpleasant in the narrow eyes. Next to him, not touching, a GIRL, big for 12. Rawboned, husky. Flat gaze, like something's dead or hidden. \nQuoyle walks to the table. A cardboard box has been filled with mementos. A slip of paper: AGNIS HAMM, a telephone number. The phone is RINGING now. Quoyle staring at the paper. Finally, lifts the phone, breathes an absent greeting, and... \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Is this Mr. Guy Quoyle? \nQUOYLE (weary) He's not here. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) This is Lt. Amos Figg of the Mockingburg, New York Police. Could you have him call me when he ret... \nQUOYLE He's passed on. He's dead. (beat) You said Mockingb... \nFIGG (O.S.) We're a small town upstate. I'm actually trying to reach his son. He allegedly went down to his parents' place two days ago. \nQuoyle blinks.   Not in the mood. \nQUOYLE Are you a detective, Lieutenant? \nFIGG (O.S.) Yes sir. \nQUOYLE Well, as you've probably deduced, I am his son. Cause I'm at his place. As alleged. \nSilence. \nFIGG (O.S.) \nThere's no need for that tone, sir. I'm calling with urgent news. \nAnd says no more.     We can feel Quoyle's heart beating from here. \nQUOYLE Which is...? \nFIGG (O.S., hesitant) You want the good news? Or the bad news. \nOminous.   Would be an understatement. \nQUOYLE The good.     Please. \nFIGG (O.S.) Your daughter Bunny was sold by your wife to a child pornographer. For $9000. \nTall and rawboned and 60. A rugged, maybe even handsome face, set with ice-blue eyes. Calm, slightly scary eyes, that drift to his robe... \nAGNIS You sick?     It's nine o'clock. \nHe is completely off-balance here. \nQUOYLE Uh. No, Bunny and I like to... uh, early to bed, earl... \nAGNIS Losin' your wife, your folks, and your job'd depress anybody. It's a wonder you don't sleep all day. \nNot that she seems to approve. Not at all. His eyes now drift to the large, well-used SUITCASES dangling from her powerful hands. \nAGNIS Thought I'd stay a day or two. Give you some relief with th... \nAnd stops.   The mouth doesn't smile.     But the eyes crinkle slightly toward... \n...Bunny. Who has crept out in her jammies.         Hugging a sack of Pepperidge Farm cookies like it was a teddy. \nAGNIS (to Bunny) You like blue dogs named Warren? \nThe little girl nods.     As if she certainly does. \nAGNIS I got one in the car. \nINT. PARLOR - LATER \nIn the far corner of the room, Bunny plays with WARREN, a sweet, ugly dog. Toothless and, undeniably, blue. \nQUOYLE (O.S.) I never knew her, really. \nSee him now, sipping his tea.     Wallowing in the detritus of his emotions. \nQUOYLE But she was driven by terrible forces, no one could understand. She was a locked door. Even to me. \nAgnis in the good chair. Teacup on her ample lap. Assessing a photo on the end table, Petal's arctic eyes, rigidly seductive pose. The snapshot enshrined by a neighboring votive rose in its jelly jar glass. \nAGNIS So she wasn't just a bitch in high heels? \nQuoyle's eyes cut instinctively toward his daughter, her innocence protected by distance and absorption with Warren's passivity. \nAGNIS Don't stress. She mighta heard worse from her momma. I'm only guessin'. \nQUOYLE Some people probably thought Petal was bad clear through. \nAGNIS People.     Are a cynical lot. \nQUOYLE I think she just couldn't get enough love. \nAgnis' unblinking eyes. \nAGNIS I think the evidence.     Is on your side. \nThe eyes study him.     Dissect him, even. \nAGNIS I'm headed north, Nephew, to where our family comes from, in Newfoundland. Thought I'd never go back. But the older y'get... \nClucks her tongue. \nAGNIS There's a pull. Becomes an ache. As if where your people started held a purpose for you. Like you're a piece in a puzzle... \nNot a smile. But something.        A softening of timbre, a flicker behind the eye. \nAGNIS ...lookin' for where y'fit. \nLifts her cup. \nAGNIS You, too. \nTakes a sip.     His eyes have narrowed in a burlesque of suspicion. \nQUOYLE In what sense do you m... \nAGNIS You need to come, Nephew. \nJust like that. \nAGNIS Nothin' here but hurt. You got to start fresh, everythin's gone! \nHmmn? \nAGNIS The trip'll clear your head. Be educational for the squirt. Teach ya the world's still spinnin' outside this toxic slice o'Hades. And who knows...? \nTilts her head.     Who knows. \nAGNIS They must have a newspaper up there. Somebody's gotta write it. \nHe just stares.     The blankest of the blank. \nAGNIS Tell the truth, I'd appreciate the company. You two are pretty much my family. \nHis face softens.       Hadn't thought of it that way.      And seeing this... \nAGNIS A pot o'coffee would hit the spot. Drop o'whiskey would fit nice in it. \nShe waits.   He rises.      And when he does... \nAGNIS Which one's my brother? \nHe blinks.   She looks at two URNS on the mantle. \nQUOYLE Uh.     There's Mom.   And that's Poppa. \nThe name of the funeral home tastefully stenciled.           He clears his throat... \nQUOYLE Those are temporary. \nApparently a private one, too.     Keeps walking. \nINT. GREEN HOUSE - TWILIGHT \nInside the dank, corroding place. We can feel all 44 years of abandonment. CRASH! The door FLIES open. Quoyle with his tire iron steps aside, and... \n...Agnis drags Bunny inside. The wind shrieking low through openings like proper spirits. Even this bold child is frightened. So Agnis leans to murmur... \nAGNIS Up those stairs, Aunt Pinkie slept. So fat she couldn't get down to her chamber pot. Wanna see if she's still there? \nAsked as a serious question.     Bunny nods.   Let's. \nANGLE...upstairs now. Agnis marching through like MacArthur reclaiming the Philippines. Room after rough-hewn spacious room, light spiking through a thousand roof holes in assorted shapes. \nAGNIS Well. Too late to drive that road back 'round the bay. We'll camp in here tonight. Be right as rain. \nQuoyle looks down to his daughter.     Who nods, as if that were a perfectly natural suggestion. \nBUNNY Which one's Petal's room?   I'll sleep there. \nINT. GREEN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nCLOSE on Bunny's sleeping face.     PUSH INTO her closed eyes, and FADE to... \n...a WINDOW, unearthly tendrils of FOG drifting past in moonglow wisps. Suddenly, a FACE appears, an animal. White. Wolf, or more likely, dog. It stares in at us, is fleetingly joined by a grizzled HUMAN ghost, eyes FLASHING crazy, and... \n...gone in mist.     CUT to... \nREAR ANGLE of Quoyle and Bunny, each rolled over onto one side, asleep in their sleeping bags. His arm across her protectively. Hers across Warren, who sleeps curled to her chest. PAN up to... \n...the window.     Only the shimmer of cloud-like mist.     SNAP to... \nREVERSE ANGLE...Bunny's eyes.     wide open. \nINT. ROOM - DAWN \nCLOSE on Quoyle, stirring at the end of sleep.        His eyes flutter open. A beat. He is alone. sits... \n...BOLT UPRIGHT. \nANGLE...front hallway, Quoyle's bulk POUNDING toward us, boots in his hand. The front door ajar. And at the threshold, in a decorous semi-circle, six naked Barbies. Legs spread wide for balance. Each staring out the doorway, to where... \n...Bunny sits on the cold ground. Making some craft project with great care. Quoyle can breathe again, she's safe. Ambles out, crouches beside her. Close. \nShe keeps working. Almost eerie concentration. He sees now that she is weaving a loop of dandelion stems, connected by aluminum pop tops. He leans down. Kisses her head. \nQUOYLE Is that a belt or a crown? \nNo answer. That concerns him. The intensity of her focus. He notices now, the soda and beer cans with their tops popped. Lined up in a row. He lifts one, liquid sloshes out. They're full. \nQUOYLE Sodas get flat withou... \nBUNNY This is important. \nShe won't look up.     He glances back to the doorway. \nQUOYLE That why the Barbies are watching? \nBUNNY They're being nice and patient. \nQUOYLE They must be chilly, tho.     Should I get their clo... \nBUNNY They look better this way.        They have great bodies. \nHe looks back. Well. Maybe so. Holds up one of the heavy boots he's carrying. It has a thick blue shoelace. The other. Has none. Sticks that one in front of her face. \nShe looks up to him.     Tugs on the shoelace, which she now wears as a necklace... \nBUNNY I need it.     I look good in blue. \nQUOYLE (smiles) Well.     I look good in shoes. \n...sees now what she has tugged from inside her shirt.     The shoelace necklace holds a dull metal KEY as a pendant.     He blinks. \nQUOYLE I was lookin' for that all over our old place. The landlady s... \nBUNNY I need it. \nHe takes that in.    The urgency of it.   She is staring in his eyes. So he grins... \nQUOYLE You had quite the heavy morning. Take the rest of the day off. \nShe doesn't smile back. Returns to her work. He looks out by the cliff, to see Agnis staring across the bay, Warren sitting at her side. He pulls on his boots. Gets to his feet. \nQUOYLE Be right back, and we'll start talking breakf... \nBUNNY (not looking up) Watch out for the dog. \nHe looks across the ground toward old Warren. \nQUOYLE Yeh, her farts are pretty scary. \nBUNNY I mean.     The white one! \nNow their eyes meet.    Matter-of-fact... \nBUNNY The White Dog with the big teeth and the red eyes. The Skinny Ghost owns him. They came last night. \nHe draws a breath... \nBUNNY I didn't dream 'em, don't say I did. \nHe thinks this over. \nQUOYLE I was gonna say.     I'll keep my eyes peeled. \nCard, who likes no one.   Doesn't like Quoyle, too. \nCARD There's your miserable desk, Quoyle. We've got no idea what yer s'posed to do. But Mr. Jack Buggit will drop by someday and enlighten us all. Til then... \nAnd he turns away. Through the swinging door.       SLAM.   Quiet. Except for Nutbeem's chuckle. \nEXT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY \nQuoyle pulls up beside the ancestral home. Agnis stands at the back of a rented truck, sorting through materials in the payload. Across a stretch of ground, Bunny is earnestly pretend-reading a book to Warren, who lies listlessly before her. \nQuoyle comes up behind Agnis.   He carries a newspaper and an excited air. \nQUOYLE Listen to this. 'Well, we see the postman has landed in jail for 45 days for throwing the mail in Killick-Claw Harbor. He said he had too much to deliver, and folks could just take a dip and help themselves.' \nHe looks up, eager for her reaction. She is still sorting through bolts of thick cloth, spools of heavy thread, odd mechanical devices. \nQUOYLE This is great stuff. 'A snowmobile mishap has taken the life of 78-year- old Rick Puff, who was on his way home from what the Widow Puff calls a 'screech-in and a carouse,' when his machine fell through the ice. A well- known accordion player, Mr. Puff had served four years in the 1970s for sexual assault on his daughters. Bet they aren't crying, either.' This Billy Pretty can really write! \nAGNIS (absently) ...passes as colorful. \nHe looks into the truck.      Sees all the stuff.   She surveys his puzzlement. \nAGNIS Nephew, we can't fix up the house proper on a journalist's wages. So I have un-retired. \nOh.   Absorbs that. \nQUOYLE From what? \nAGNIS Upholstery. Been sought after for 33 years, wherever I've lived. This should be the real test, huh? \nQuoyle nods. Could be that. The sudden sound of footsteps above them, makes him look up sharply, to see... \n...a fit young MAN in a toolbelt climbing down a ladder from the roof. The muscles of a stud, the shy smile of a boy, he waves a greeting and HOPS down the last six feet to the ground. \nAGNIS This is Dennis Buggit, master carpenter. \nDENNIS offers a hand, and a smile that says he's expecting to like you. Makes the sentiment contagious. \nDENNIS Only til I get my lobster license. I'm a fisherman in my soul. \nA strong handshake.   On both sides. \nDENNIS It's a Newfie thing, the compulsion to fish. Y'hear yesterday's tragedy \n'bout the Newfie who went ice fishin'? \nQuoyle hasn't. \nDENNIS Brought home 200 pounds of ice. His wife fried it. They both drowned. \nQuoyle laughs good and honest.      Dennis likes that. \nAGNIS With me workin', we'll need day care for Bunny after school. Turns out Dennis and his wife send their little girl to this wonderful saintly woman. How's that for us livin' a charmed life? \nQuoyle nods, if a bit cautious.      Dennis squints out across the bay. \nDENNIS Agnis says yer buyin' a boat. Sooner's prob'ly better'n lat... \nQUOYLE (quiet smile) I'm not buyin'. No boat. \nSounds pretty sure of that.      Punctures the amiable ambiance with a shard of silence. \nAGNIS Well, course we're buy... \nQUOYLE (to Dennis) Buggit, huh? Any kin to my boss on the Gammy Bird? \nThe silence.     Just got thunderous.   A full beat. \nDENNIS (low) Oh, yeh.   He's m'dad. \nEven the eyes glance down.      What is that?   In the wake of it... \nAGNIS (cheerful) Gonna chat up yer daughter, or just ignore her as usual? \nQuoyle nods. Better do that. Dennis sends a shy smile, as if apologizing for the awkwardness. Quoyle holds up a finger, be right back, and... \n...heads on over to where Bunny is reading to Warren. \nBUNNY Warren threw up in your sleeping bag. She's got a stomach problem. \nQuoyle takes a breath to answer, but stops.     He's caught a whiff. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) Headline.     Dog Fart Fells Freelance Reporter.     Promising Career Nipped in Bud. \nBUNNY It's called cancer. \nOh. Quoyle holds his face together, as Bunny strokes the limp Warren. Then, he crouches down... \n...strokes Warren, too.     Good dog. \nINT. GAMMY BIRD - MORNING \nQuoyle enters. Billy Pretty's on the phone, hand cupped over the receiver, like it's top secret. Nutbeem's tuning his ancient shortwave with a butter knife through the hole where a knob ought to be. And as Quoyle sets down his sack lunch and thermos, as he peels off his parka, he's staring straight into the eyes of... \n...Tert Card across the way. Wearing a wicked and mysterious smile. As Quoyle's butt lowers toward his chair... \nBOOMING VOICE (O.S.) ATTENTION QUOYLE! \nOuoyle JUMPS a foot.   Looks from Card to Billy to Nutbeem.    What's going on? \nBOOMING VOICE (O.S.) IT'S AN I.Q. TEST, ME OLD SON, AND YOU AIN'T EXCELLING! \nWHIPS around. Through the glass of the only private office, sits a rumpled codger with a bullhorn. JACK BUGGIT, has his rubber boots up on the desk, scale-spattered overalls over his compact, sinewy body. His hair is wisps and shocks, and his face is strewn with stubble split by a leprechaun's grin around a stained hand-rolled ciggie. \nJACK (into bullhorn) DOES PAYIN' YER SHAMEFUL WAGE ENTITLE ME TO A PERSONAL AUDIENCE? OR WOULDJA RATHER JUST STAND THERE AN' DROOL? \nShe turns to Quoyle.       Who just gapes at her.   Open-mouthed. \nQUOYLE (softly) Oh.   My.    God. \nINT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY \nQuoyle enters, impressed by the progress of the renovation. Windows are in, walls patched, floor sanded, lights are working. \nThrough the place into... \n...the kitchen, which is in surprisingly usable shape. Agnis sits alone at a butcher block table with a set of ledgers spread before her. A large mug of tea. A bottle of Bushmill's Irish. \nQUOYLE You are a woman of mystery, Aunt. Mystery and surprise. \nAGNIS (still working) Silver Melville says you was out there. Be nice in yer story, she's payin' for a piece of this house. \nSilence. \nQUOYLE You said upholstery.   Never said yacht uphol... \nAGNIS ...never said not. Ask better questions, you got a chance fer better answers. Got my shop set up in Killick-Claw, now. \nLooks up.    Sees he's dazzled by how she moves right along. \nAGNIS Two good workers. Mrs. Mavis Bangs is an old plow horse like m'self. But Dawn... \nShe winks. \nAGNIS Dawn's young and on the sexy side. You oughta drop by and say hullo. \nHe absorbs that.     How fast can he change the subject? \nQUOYLE Where's Bunny? \nAgnis looks at him.     Reaches for the Bushmill's. \nAGNIS Upstairs, in what will soon become her room. She'll be all right. \nQUOYLE What does that mean? \nShe pours some whiskey into her tea cup. \nQUOYLE Little early in the day f... \nAGNIS Warren died today.    That's what that means. \nDrinks the whiskey.    Stares straight in his eyes.     Sees his sorrow. The honesty in... \nQUOYLE Poor old girl. \nAgnis deciding.    Whether to tell him... \nAGNIS I used to live with someone named Warren. Died of cancer, after nine years together. Dearest soul on this earth. \nQuoyle shocked. What can he say? His empathy so naked, so real, even Agnis has to soften her voice... \nAGNIS Went from the funeral, and bought that dog. Named her Warren. Just so I could say the name a hunnerd times a day. Women are foolish, huh? \nQUOYLE I never thought so. \nA good moment for them.    It holds a beat. \nAGNIS Bunny wants to bury the dog with me. But I told her I'd rather do it alone. \nQuoyle nods.   Rises slowly.   He'd better go to her. \nAGNIS Some advice about the child? \nAnother sip. \nAGNIS Don't get down on her level, the way you do. She'll never respect you. \nINT. BUNNY'S ROOM - DAY \nBunny sits on the floor in dim light, wearing an enormous blue sweatshirt. Obviously dad's. Her naked Barbies sit in a semi- circle watching her braid a meticulous loop out of the paper and foil from chewing gum wrappers. Quoyle enters, and sits close beside her. Watches in silence, as she works. \nBUNNY (not looking up) Warren died today. She's not coming back. \nNo tears.   Just a hollow sound in her voice. \nBUNNY That's the difference. \nHe knows what she means.      Strokes her hair. \nQUOYLE Another necklace, huh?    Can I help? \nBUNNY You can watch. \nOkay.   He looks at the Barbies. \nQUOYLE Do I have to take my clothes off? \nShe looks up at him.     Straight to his eyes. \nBUNNY You look better with 'em on. \nGoes back to work.     He watches her. \nQUOYLE You know.    You do look good in blue. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nQuoyle driving the wagon, Dennis at his side. Up ahead on the road, two figures. Herry holds tight to his mom's hand. Quoyle pulls over, and they stop. Wavey squints at him, against the sun. \nQUOYLE Give you folks a lift? \nBUNNY First is the teaching part.     The learning comes later. \nHerry nods.   Later.   And out of the blue... \nBUNNY Wavey? Now are the berries ready to pick? \nQuoyle looks over to the woman. But instead of Wavey, he sees PETAL, staring at him with slow predatory heat. \nPETAL Want to pick my berries, do you. Should I climb right up on this sink? \nAnd then, once more she is... \nWAVEY Almost. Almost ready.       You know, it's all about timing. \nQuoyle.   Takes note. \nINT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY \nQuoyle alone in the office, pretending to peck away at a story. Actually, he's looking... \n...through the window. Where Jack Buggit, Tert Card, Billy Pretty and Nutbeem are all circling around a small, roughly-made boat, attached to its rented trailer. They are talking to each other in learned tones. A Talmudic chat. And... \n...in they come.     First through the door... \nCARD That's yer boat. \nQUOYLE Said it was. \nCARD One question remains.     Why. Is that. Yer boat? \nUh-oh. He looks from one face to another. Even Billy is irritated. Nutbeem gazes down, embarrassed for him. \nQUOYLE Well.   A boat's a boa... \nCARD It's a shit boat. Best thing, get rid of it some dark night. \nQuoyle can't believe this.      Hot shame burns. \nBILLY Go hire Alvin Yark to build ya a sweet little rodney. This thing's a wallowing cockeyed bastard that'll sink in a bathtub. \nAnd standing in the doorway, the scariest sight of all.    The boss. Just shaking his head. \nJACK (sadly) \nYou don't have the sense God gave a doughnut, do ya? \nThe word from Sinai on Quoyle's worth.       A pity. \nJACK I'm goin' fishin'. \nOut the door with a SLAMM!      Quoyle stares hopelessly after him. \nNUTBEEM Don't jump off a bridge over it. Anyone can make a brainless, asinine, devastatingly revealing blunder. \nQUOYLE (actually means this) Thanks. \nCARD What in th' furry pit of Newfie hell. Is this!? \nHolds up some sheets of paper.       Photos of the Melvilles' botterjacht. Reads... \nCARD Hitler's Barge...? \nQUOYLE That goes with the shipping news. Profile of a vessel in port. \nCARD What about the car accident? \nQUOYLE That's the one I didn't do. Mrs. Diddolate sprained her wrist. Period. \nCard still reading. \nCARD So you didn't do the one Jack told yer to do, and you did one he don't know yer did! \nSilence. \nQUOYLE Pretty mu... \nCARD This copy.     Is worse.   Than yer boat. \nHe looks up.   Equal parts disgust and delight. \nCARD \nJack even sniffs this, he cuts you up fer lobster bait. I've half a mind to run it. \nQuoyle straightens his spine. \nQUOYLE Run it. \nStrides off for the door.     Turns back... \nQUOYLE As for the part about you havin' half a mind? No comment. \nOut the door.   SLAMM harder than Jack's. \nEXT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY \nQuoyle stumbling toward his wagon with vacant eyes. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) Headline. Reporter Disembowels Self With Rusty Joke. \nEXT. GREEN HOUSE ROOF - DAY \nQuoyle in a carpenter's belt, climbing very carefully from a ladder onto the roof. His vertigo apparent as he keeps to his hands and knees, trying to fight the compulsion to look down. Gives in to it, peering from the corner of his eye down the cliff, the rocks, the sea so far below. Not a good 1dea. \nComes to the shingles. Eases his way into a fearful crouch.   Okay. Starts hammering. And rehearsing. \nAGNIS And this is Dawn Budgel.   She's a vegetarian. \nDawn, once described by Agnis as young and on the sexy side, is that. Red lipstick and nails. Her eyes float up in a way that suggests reflexive sensuality. Agnis nods to her, and the girl reaches a slender pale hand... \nDAWN Agnis is always saying such...things about you. It's nice to fit a man. \nWith the name. \nAnd as she releases his hand, her eyes flick to Agnis. Some conspiracy there. Quoyle follows his aunt back to the big cutting table. \nQUOYLE I just, uh, came to see if you'd heard abou.. \nAGNIS Silver Melville?    Snuck off in the night, they did.    Not a penny paid for all we done. \nShows him sheets of baby blue leather. \nAGNIS We'd installed the banquettes in her salon. Three of the chairs done and delivered, three to go... \nPoints to them.    A neat row by the makeshift kitchenette. \nQUOYLE That's.    That's just terrible. \nBut Agnis is thinking... \nAGNIS Strange.    Leavin' the chairs. \nAnd as he glances off, he sees Dawn across the way.      Her skirt hiked up, as if she were adjusting a stocking. \nShe isn't wearing any. \nEXT. HILLSIDE - DAY \nBillowy clouds frame a languid KITE, silver and sleek, darting this way and that. Graceful, in command of the currents. \nWAVEY (O.S.) HERRY PROWSE! LOOK HOW WELL YOUR KITE IS DOING! \nSee her now, seated atop a grassy slope. It is she who holds the string, and her boy is way down at the bottom of the hill with Bunny. Blue jumper billowing, the girl is teaching him how to make necklaces from wildflowers and garbage bag twisty-ties. Herry and the naked Barbies watch with great attention. The learning will come later. \nWAVEY ARE YOU MAKING IT DANCE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS? \nOn this he looks up.     Serious. \nWAVEY KEEP THINKING YOUR THOUGHTS! YOUR KITE IS DOING SO MUCH BETTER THAN MR. QUOYLE'S! \nPULL BACK slightly to reveal that Quoyle has been sitting right beside her all along. He holds the string of a big, glum kite that hangs motionless in space with barely a flutter. As she watches the kids, he stares at her, fixedly deciding whether to ask... \nQUOYLE (barely audible) Do you think Bunny's. Strange? \nWavey looks over.     Sees that he's worried half to death. \nQUOYLE In New York. They said she had a... personality disorder. \nWAVEY (softly) And it was named Petal. \nDo you understand that? \nQUOYLE All these hallucin... \nWAVEY The White Dog. Sometimes with the Skinny Ghost. Kids do things like that, it's called imagination. Like the necklaces. \nThe necklaces, yeh.     A thought that frightens him. \nQUOYLE You know how many she makes? \nShe does. \nWAVEY It's a skill, she's proud of it. And she brings her dolls along. And she looks good in blue. And she wears a key for a good luck charm. \nHer kind smile.     No big deal. \nQUOYLE And she's saving her mother a room. Did she tell you that? \nWavey's slow nod. \nQUOYLE \nShe talks to her at night.        I can hear through the door. \nVery quiet now.    The wind.     The kites. \nQUOYLE You know how kids think.       You have all those books. \nWAVEY The ones I read to teach Herry. They don't make me an exp... \nQUOYLE (blurting) Just.     Is she okay? \nThat was naked.    He swallows. \nQUOYLE I mean.     If you had to guess.. \nToo serious a subject.       Too good a woman.     For an easy lie. \nWAVEY That child is the only friend my son ever had. So she's strange, you bet. \nShe swallows, too.    Her eyes are damp. \nWAVEY I love that little girl. And I will see to it. That she's all right. \nHold the look. \nWAVEY And I don't have to guess about it. \nEXT. WOODS - LATER \nQuoyle RUNNING, huffing, through a bog with every color of berries imaginable. Around another bend in the path. Stops. Hands on his knees. \nBILLY Every time I wonder.     Is this the last coat? \nPries the lid off the tin of black.     And when he sees Quoyle's eyes... \nBILLY Well, there's no one else to do it, y'see. \nQUOYLE (straight back) There is now. \nAn easy smile.   Stating the obvious. \nQUOYLE \nThere's me. \nThe old man's face just stops.     The eyes sharpen.   Into a question. \nQUOYLE Well, you said. There's no one else. \nAs if that were enough. \nQUOYLE Hey. If you wanna rest next to him. I'll paint yours at the same time. No extra trouble. \nBilly stares at him.     Stares at him.   Clears his throat, gruffly. \nBILLY Then better get Alvin Yark. T'build yer a real boat. So yer'll be around. \nEXT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY \nQuoyle exits the house, pulling on his jacket, and... \n...stops. Something laid across his threshold. A long piece of TWINE has been placed there. KNOTS tied evenly along its length. He glances back up to the second floor, thinking Bunny. Looks at the thing again. Neat work. Odd. Slips it in his pocket. \nEXT. CLIFFSIDE - DAY \nQuoyle now making his way down a steep primitive trail through lush vegetation. The green house is far above him. The shimmering bay now just below. This way down as treacherous as it is wondrous, and Quoyle SLIPS in the tangle and wet, half-slides through wild angelica stalks and patches of dogberry, suddenly... \n...LOSING his balance, TUMBLING roughly down a stretch, rolling, grasping a spruce trunk. Pulling himself to his feet, he hears... RUSTLING. Looks up, just as... \n...a WHITE DOG appears through the bushes. Red eyes. Lips curled back. A frozen second of mutual indecision, and Quoyle... \n...SCREAMS and falls on his butt.     The dog... \n...TAKES OFF, bounding down a path we hadn't noticed. Toward an upright SILHOUETTE. Who steps into sun just long enough to become... \n...a MAN, grizzled and scrawny and quick.      Gone in a flash.   Like a skinny ghost. And there, on his butt... \n...Quoyle laughs softly.     How 'bout that?   Murmurs... \nQUOYLE Attaway, girl. You're smarter'n all of us. \nAs he climbs to his feet, he sees the rocky beach just below. Squints, as if at something that doesn't belong. We see it now... \n...a SUITCASE, washed up onto a tangle of rocks, just offshore. \nANGLE...Quoyle wading into the water. Up to his knees, slips, sinks to his waist. Stays upright. Snatches the suitcase from its perch. Brings it back to shore, holding it high. Already, he is making the face of someone smelling something he'd rather not. \nHe sets it down. The face is worse.     His curiosity running the show, he unhooks the latch... \n...and stops. Because he's staring inside. Suddenly, he SCREAMS and FLAILS back, his leg STRIKING the case, and out tumbles onto the wet ground... \n...the head.   Of Bayonet Melville. \nINT. SKIPPER WILL'S DINER - NIGHT \nThree guys. Three beers. Five squidburgers (Quoyle likes his backups ready and waiting). \nCARD Y'know none a that impresses Jack Buggit. He's not one fer blatant ambition. \nQuoyle thinks better of his answer.    Chomps a bite instead. \nNUTBEEM Even if you don't recognize 'Human Head Packed in Satchel' as the most compelling piece ever to appear in... \nCARD (snorts) Even if. \n...takes his hand from his greasy burger.    Scratches his crotch below the table. \nNUTBEEM A triple increase in ad revenue. Does get. The man's attention. \nAnd winks at the silent hero. \nCARD Weren't even double if yer figger it right. (to Quoyle) Point is. A real reporter woulda \nnamed the obvious suspect. \nQUOYLE More obvious. Than the wife? \nCARD Yer aunt, ya thick Statie lardface dumbass! \nQuoyle.   And Nutbeem.   Just look at each other. \nCARD She gets stiffed by the guy, after basin' her new shop on that revenue. And she ain't one ta fool with. Capable a anything, that woman! \nQUOYLE (angry now) Okay, where's the wife? Agnis kill her too? \nCARD Okay, where's this week's shipping news? Or you gonna rest on yer Crisco-coated laurels. \nQuoyle viciously BITES into his squidburger. \nCARD Uh-oh. The way he's chewin', he ain't a fat boy t'be trifled with! \nNUTBEEM (quietly) His piece.     Is about oil tankers. \nCard blinks.   Looks at Quoyle with, dare we say, new respect. \nCARD Hope fer ya yet. Now that's news, the McGonigle oil field. Petrodollars, a golden flood a jobs. That's th'future a this god-forsaken ice rock. Civilization! \nA hush.    A frozen tableau in this room. \nQUOYLE Run it.   Like I wrote it. \nCARD How does this suit yer, Quoyle? I'll do my job. You do yers, which means a four-vehicle pile-up south a Killick-Claw. And don't ferget the camera. \nHe slides the battered camera across the desk. They glare at each other a full beat. Card belches, softly. Quoyle takes the camera, heads for the door... \nCARD I fergot somethin'. \nQuoyle turns.    Card doesn't. \nCARD You pinko Greepeace sack a quivering pigfat. \nThinks. \nCARD Did I leave out moosebutt-ugly? (nods to himself) You may go. \nHOLD on him.    Making a neat little pile of the torn pieces. \nQUOYLE (O.S.) Like I wrote it. \nSLAMM! Across the room, Nutbeem stands.        Takes his cigarettes. Passing Card's desk, on the way out... \nNUTBEEM Tough love. Impressive. \nSLAMM!    Card shoots Billy a challenging look.     You got something to say? \nBILLY I hope you get him fired. \nDo you. \nBILLY So I can watch him beat yer to jelly. \nJust turns around.     Flicks ON his computer.   Back to work. \nEXT. GREEN HOUSE - TWILIGHT \nBunny jumping out of the wagon, running to the house.      As Quoyle locks his car... \nBUNNY (O.S.) Why'd you leave the house open? \nHe looks up.   She is pushing the front door with one finger.     It swings OPEN. \nBUNNY Can I keep the necklace? \n...and lifts a long piece of TWINE. There are KNOTS neatly tied along its length. Quoyle stares. Stares. \nQUOYLE (calm) Sweetie.     Come sit in the car. \nINT. FRONT HALLWAY - TWILIGHT \nQuoyle climbing the stairs in fading light. He carries a tire iron. Stops midway. Listens to the silence. \nQUOYLE IF ANYBODY'S THERE, YOU BETTER COME OUT NOW! \nUp, up, to the top.     Looking down the empty hall to see... \n...knotted twine.     At every door. \nINT. GAMMY BIRD - EARLY MORNING \nQuoyle enters, haggard and distracted. The place is lit, but empty. A toilet FLUSHES. From the loo, appears... \nCARD S'tell me.     Yer fancy it? \nNodding toward something behind Quoyle. Turning, we see that hanging over Card's desk is an oversized framed photo of: QUIET EYE - WORLD'S LARGEST OIL TANKER. Quoyle stares blankly. \nQUOYLE \nLike I said.    Nobody hangs those. \nCard just goes to the fresh stack of newspapers on his desk.       Hands one toward Quoyle... \nCARD Yer column's front page stuff. Only now, it's more like a caption, is all. \nA photo of the same tanker.       That hangs on Card's wall. \nQUOYLE (reads) More than 3000 tankers proudly ride the world's seas. Even the biggest take advantage of Newfoundland's deep- water ports and refineries. \nCARD Spelled everthin' perfect.     So as not t'embarrass yer. \nQUOYLE (reading) Oil and Newfoundland go together like ham and eggs, and like ham and eggs they'll nourish us in the coming years. \nCARD Even put yer name on it. \nQUOYLE (finishes reading) Let's all hang a picture of an oil tanker. On our wall. \nStares at the paper.     In his hand. \nCARD Man a yer principles. I unnerstan' resignation is th'only honorable course. \nQuoyle looks up.     Card flinches back.    But all that comes is... \nQUOYLE How can a man resign.    To nobody? \nDrops the paper on the floor.       Steps on it, on his way toward the door. \nCARD If yer off to see Jack Buggit, yer'll hafta swim some. \nQuoyle turns back. \nCARD Yer can whine an' beg t'him.     But I \nruns his paper, every inch of it, every dirty time-eatin' job which he would have t'do without me. \nBunny looks down.    Glaring an evil spell of death at her own kneecaps. \nWAVEY (quietly) I think Bunny and I. Should take a walk. \nAnd stands. \nQUOYLE Uh. Wavey? If it's all the same to you... \nEXT. PATH - DAY \nQuoyle and Bunny alone, hand-in-hand, walking slow where they once picked berries. Nobody's talking. \nBUNNY When you gonna ask? \nQUOYLE (calm) When you're in the mood. \nApparently, that hasn't happened yet.      More walking. \nQUOYLE She musta done something.     Really bad. \nSaid like he means it.    Which he does.     And Bunny, squinting up, sees that. \nINTERCUT...the crime. Playground filled with kids. Bunny and girlfriends on the jungle gym. Bunny the best, a natural jock. MRS. LUMBULL large, sour, doughy, and betrayed by life, stands with her silver whistle in the midst of chaos. Her thoughts on a higher \nplane. \nBUNNY (O.S.) She's the worst one of all! \nLittle Herry Prowse comes to tug at the teacher's wool coat. He is holding his crotch and jumping up and down. This does not require an advanced credential to interpret. \nBUNNY (O.S.) Herry told her he had to pee. But the way he talks. He could just say 'eeee,' like that. \nMrs. Lumbull looks down. From her face as she responds, she has already devoted, over time, more professional attention to this troublemaker than should be asked of any dedicated educator. \nBUNNY (O.S.) She told him that recess was almost over, an' she wasn't gonna make a trip special, an' he could hold it. \nHerry, seemingly, disagrees. Still holding his crotch, he jumps up and down with greater agitation. She grabs him, rather roughly, by the arm. Marches him over to... \nBUNNY (O.S.) She made him stand against the wall. \n...and walks off, pointedly ignoring him from ten feet away. He screams, pumping his fists in frustration. Grabs himself, suddenly. Whether or not we can see the dampness spread, we can see his humiliation all too clearly. As his tears come... \n...a figure BOLTS into frame from behind Mrs. Lumbull. Hunched over like a linebacker, full speed ahead, LAUNCHING herself into the back of the large woman's knees. Her feet go UP, and the rest of her goes... \n...DOWN like the proverbial amount of bricks. Herry's tears stop fast. Watching the woman shriek, and keep shrieking. Makes him laugh. CUT... \nBACK TO...the berry path.   They are sitting on a fallen log. \nQUOYLE See, a good dad would say hitting is always wrong. You coulda hurt her bad. I guess you know that. \nBUNNY She wasn't hurt for real.     Just screamed like a baby. \nQuoyle pulls out a single Snickers bar. \nQUOYLE Wish I'd seen it.     It really sounds funny. \nBUNNY Petal'll think so, too. \nHe looks at her.      Nods, probably will.    Peels the candy bar free of its wrapper. \nQUOYLE Well, there won't be any trouble at school. I'II take care of that. \nBUNNY How? \nHe breaks the candy bar in half.        Tho not quite equally. \nQUOYLE Because the best thing about people. Is they can forgive each other. I heard that this morning. \nBUNNY That teacher. Is gonna forgive me? \nHe nods.   Oh, yeh. \nQUOYLE That. And she won't want the story printed in the paper. \nOh. \nBUNNY Well.   I don't wanna forgive her. \nQUOYLE Me neither. \nHe holds out the two pieces of candy. She takes them both.         the bigger one in his mouth. As he chews... \nBUNNY I had to do it. 'Cept for Wavey, I'm the only family Herry's got. \nShe nibbles at her own piece. \nBUNNY Like the ghost.     Who's not a ghost. \nHmmn? \nBUNNY The one who ties the knots?     You're \nthe only family he's got. \nRight?   Her father doesn't react.       He's even stopped chewing. \nBUNNY You said. \nAnd slowly.    Quoyle nods.    I said. \nEXT. NOLAN'S SHED - DAY \nQuoyle picks his way down to the battered boat shed, hidden at the foot of his cliff. He carries a big carton, which we see has made the journey slow and awkward. Across the gravel now, to... \n...the door. HEAR the fire crackling, see the smoke curling. Takes a breath. Knocks softly. Then LOUDER. \nQUOYLE (really casual) Macau, huh? So. That where y'sent th' chairs? \nAgnis turns.   Sizes him up. \nAGNIS It's flatterin' you showin' me how you've turned into such a competent reporter and all. But even if I remembered where I sent 'em. I couldn't tell ya. \nPuts her fingers to her lips.      Leans closer, to confide something he is obviously unaware of... \nAGNIS Professional ethics. \nINT. WAVEY'S KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT \nCLOSE on Wavey, cooking flapjacks.      Talking to them. \nWAVEY Only you.     Could do this. \nAnd she's not pleased. \nWAVEY You fed him. You gave him clothes. You're the first human ever was kind to him... \nShe scoops them expertly into a stack. \nWAVEY Accordingly. You're sick with guilt. \nServes them to... \nWAVEY You sure you're not a complex guy? \n...Quoyle, who nods absently. About the one thing he is sure of. Just now, he's examining the prodigious status of her oxblood knitting. Still attached to the needles, it looks too broad for a muffler. \nQUOYLE (decides) Horse blanket. \nWAVEY (ah!) That's what that is! \nA beat.   Another. \nQUOYLE So if y'called around.      Musta found somepla... \nWAVEY (quietly) One decent golden age home. It's in St. John's. You can maybe afford it, tho God knows why you should. \nShe pushes the flapjacks closer to him, CLANKS down the fork, eat! She's exasperated. Thinks he's wasting his money. \nQUOYLE I can't put him there, til I go down to St. John's. See it's all right. \nWAVEY Great!      Let's not be rash! \nQUOYLE Come with me. \nAnd everything.      Sorta.    Stops. \nQUOYLE I mean, the kids could stay with \nDennis and Beety.       Or Agnis, or... \nA meaningful beat. \nWAVEY Why.   Would I. Do that? \nShe looks deep in his eyes. Hard to guess the answer she wants to hear. He clears his throat. Looks down. \nQUOYLE Well. Remember when you said. Someday, I'd do something nice for you? \nAnd when he looks to her, she is... \nPETAL (Wavey's voice) And this is it. \nA witheringly sexy smile. \nQUOYLE Hey. Overnight trip to St. John's. All expenses paid. \nPetal arches a delicate brow. \nPETAL (Wavey's voice) Overnight? \nHe blinks.   And sees... \nWAVEY What's wrong with a weekend? \nWith a playful smile.      Of her own. \nEXT. DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, ST. JOHN'S - DAY \nNot London, but it might as well be. Wavey and Quoyle atop a red double-decker bus, wind whipping their hair. She is watching the big city flow past, drinking every inch of it. He's watching her. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nWavey carries an armload of little girl's tights and corduroy pants, picking through a bin of barrettes. Quoyle appears with a fistful of neckties. Holds them up hopefully to his chest one at a time, each more breathtakingly godawful than the last. Well? She SHIVERS with disgust. Lifts from her shopping bag a nice conser- vative one she's already picked for him. He SHIVERS, just as she did. They share the trace of a grin, just alike. He walks off. \n...Wavey trying on furry hats in a full-length mirror, as Quoyle keeps feeding her an endless supply from a double armful. She pouts and poses like a runway model, basically frowning that the \nhats aren't working. He's staring at her as if nothing else exists in the universe. She knows it. \n...Wavey alone at a cash register. The checker is ringing up a selection of lacy bras and panties. Suddenly, Wavey looks up to see Quoyle at the register one aisle over, staring fixedly at her purchases. Seeing she's noticed him, he holds up a huge pair of loud boxer shorts he's buying, and WAVES them at her. She laughs and waves her bras right back. Civilians watching think they're in love. \nEXT./INT. ST. JOHN'S - DAY/NIGHT \n...Quoyle and Wavey stroll the grounds of Nolan's future retirement home. It is twilight, and the modest place looks pleasant and welcoming. Quoyle listens earnestly, as the director points things out. Wavey watching Quoyle, her gaze not so disapproving after all. \n...CLOSE on Quoyle with a bowling ball, poised, glaring our way. Here he comes. Stumbles. Lets go. REVERSE ANGLE to see the ball rolling, rolling real slow. Quoyle turns his back, strides away with confidence like he doesn't even have to watch, this is too easy. Wavey points, look. He turns in time to see two pins fall. Pumps his fist. YESSSS! \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nIt's late. It's dim. It's as romantic as urban Newfoundland will ever get. Our couple nursing beers at the corner table of a passably stylish bar. Piano playing show tunes, but soft. He pulls from his pocket... \n...a travel brochure.     Slightly drunk, completely merry, almost wicked smile. \nJACK You were sayin'...? \nQuoyle sucks it up. \nQUOYLE His whole life would be changed. If he could come upon. A fishing license. \nJack's eyes.   Flat and cold as the cod he's gutting. \nJACK Well, there's only one a those issued per family. So how exactly would he do that? \nThis is not.   Going well.   A dangerous silence. \nJACK Even doughnuts, y'know.   Can push their luck. \nINT. WAVEY'S PARLOR - DUSK \nThe day care contingent more organized today. Sort of. Bunny leading a spirited round of red-light/green-light, as... \n...Quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents. As he shrugs off his coat, he looks at the Christmas tree, its winking lights. The decorations that seem to be everywhere, many handmade by these children. He watches Bunny call out 'Red Light!', only to have Herry ignore it and tackle her anyway. \nMixed emotions, to be sure. A feeling of family he can at least visit, yet will never be his own. The sad edge catches up with him, so he strolls on into... \n...the kitchen. Wavey baking, what else.      She smiles to see him. A friend's smile. \nWAVEY (Southern belle) Why, Mistuh Quoyle. You shouldn't have! \nHe smiles back.    Takes her in for a telling beat, before... \nQUOYLE Uh.   I didn't. Most of these \nare for Herry. \nEven better. \nQUOYLE There's two. Are yours. \nThey are on top. Personally wrapped in his slightly bulging, fine-motor-control-challenged, personal style. Be sets them on the counter. \nQUOYLE You prob'ly want to wait for Christmas. \nMeaning, please don't. So she wipes her hands on her apron.    Lets him see her eyes dance just a flicker. \nWAVEY Oh, I'm much too excited. \nDelicately unwraps the first. Lifts out a PORCELAIN TEAPOT, finely painted with an assortment of BERRIES. She holds it in her hands, at once admiring and wistful. Wondering if there's a message about their moment together while berry-picking. \nQUOYLE It's from a museum catalogue.       But it's not real. It's a copy. \nWAVEY (still gazing at it) It is my favorite teapot. \nA simple pronouncement. She opens the second, flat and narrow. It is a TURQUOISE BRACELET. Actually, kind of stunning. She blinks, taken back by the beauty and perhaps the expense. \nQUOYLE It's nice for your eyes.     I thought. \nShe doesn't sayanything.   Lets it dangle from her fingers, catch the light. \nQUOYLE It's for everyday. You don't have to save it for special. \nShe looks to him. Her eyes are shining maybe more than she wants. Her voice perhaps softer than she even intends... \nWAVEY Oh, I'll save this, all right. \nCovers.   With only a slightly more than friendly smile. \nWAVEY And I'll think of you.     When I \nput lot on. \nHe can only nod. He'd like that.    She holds up one finger, wait a second. And hurries off. \nSo he waits. Looking at her kitchen. Feeling his feelings.         She is back, with two boxes. Sets them down. Nods, go ahead... \n...one is heavy and square. He opens it to find a LEATHER-BOUND CASE. He looks at her, smiles in his childlike way. Opens the case, which reveals... \n...two leather-bound VOLUMES. One a dictionary.      The other a thesaurus. He is obviously moved. \nQUOYLE (a murmur) You must have me mistaken. For a writer. \nAnd when he looks up. \nWAVEY I don't make mistakes.     About that kind of thing. \nHe stares at her long enough to make her nod toward the other package. Big and flat, but not heavy at all. He lifts the lid, and pulls out... \n...a huge comfy SWEATER.   In oxblood wool.    He is completely stunned to realize... \nWAVEY (so pleased) Well, you can't be surprised. You've seen me knitting it for months. \nQUOYLE It was so big, I thought it was a tea cozy for your car. But if it's for me, it has to be bigger, huh? \nPut it on, put it on! So he slips it over his head. Big enough and then some. This worries her. She plucks at it... \nWAVEY Well.   You'll grow into it. \nQUOYLE You kiddin'? After the holidays, we'll have to stretch it. \nHe's just beaming. Hugs himself to show how warm it is.      The silence is companionable. Then... \nQUOYLE Not used to a woman.     Giving me presents. \nShe raises a brow.     Can scarcely believe that. \nQUOYLE One Christmas with Petal, I gave her eleven things. And I wrapped them. And watched her open them up. \nShe holds her friendly smile.     But her eyes have changed. Slightly. \nShe puts her toe out, SLIPS wildly, windmilling her arms, pantomiming as she bends double under the phantom clock. \nWAVEY Mite slick. Four feet thick a ice. \nTears are streaming from a hundred eyes and more. \nWAVEY Meanwhile, at the bottom, Auntie Fizzard, 91 years young, sets out in her non-slip galoshes and her cane with the rubber tip. Didn't yer, dearie? \nBows to the old gal in the front row, who is scarlet-faced in hysterics, as all around her applaud. Wavey becomes her, inching along, casting fierce glances right and left to warn the world. \nWAVEY Meanwhile, at the top... \nShe is Billy once more, beneath his burden, her long legs stutter- stepping to one side, then the other, slipping, skidding, the howling all around her threatening to shatter walls, and... \nWAVEY ...OVER he goes, clock-side down, and PICKIN' UP SPEED! \nMiming the wild ride as they ROAR... \nWAVEY ...eight blocks, NINE, missing everything like a miracle, zeroing in on... \nShe becomes Auntie Fizzard once more, shuffling, looking left, right, and suddenly up WILD-EYED! \nWAVEY CLIPS 'er inta the snow bank! \nNods sadly.   Leaning on her cane.     When at last they quiet. \nWAVEY Just two galoshes stickin' outta the snow. She digs 'er way out. Brushes herself off. Looks at him sprawled like a turtle on his back, tied to his massive burden. She says... \nShe says. \nWAVEY YOU THERE!     BILLY PRETTY! \nLevels a dead-eyed killer gaze. \nWAVEY WHY CAN'T YOU WEAR A WRISTWATCH LIKE EVER'BODY ELSE? \nThe place comes DOWN like a house of cards. Bedlam surrounds Quoyle who sits still as a stone. Too dazzled to breathe. \nEXT. ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING. \nLonely stretch of wooded road, middle of nowhere. Light snow just starting to fall. A truck pulls up beneath a tree. Out climbs... \n...Wavey. Looking grim, walking slow. Crosses the road to a weathered diner. The woman who only smokes when she's worried, pulls out a pack of Camels. Looks through the diner's frosted window... \n...a lone customer sits nursing his coffee. He is 40, lean, very attractive. Dark hard eyes, set into worries of their own. Wavey lights up. Watches in silence until... \n...the man looks up. Their eyes meet through the glass.      Hold. And on his faint smile... \nShe turns her back.   Starts up the road. \nANGLE...he is walking beside her now. Snow drifting lazy, her smoke curling up. He watches her anger, how cold and quiet and closed. Smiles at her profile... \nHEROLD I shoulda come last night.     Seen the show. \nShe can't even believe he said that.     Never looking at him... \nWAVEY Woulda been a thrill for the Christians among' em. They think you're dead. \nKeep walking.   His smile is gentle. \nHEROLD Well, then we got good news for th... \nWAVEY So does your son. \nA beat. \nHEROLD Even better news for him. \nWAVEY (low) You think so. \nBreaking the words off.   He's watching her profile. \nHEROLD (very soft) I can't undo the hurt I've done. Unless you let me. \nGauging the feeling behind the bitterness. \nHEROLD There's a million reasons to send me away. Good ones. And only two reasons not to. \nIs she even listening?     He lets the silence hang. \nHEROLD I love you. And you love me. \nShe stops walking.     Flips her cigarette off into the snow.       Turns now... \nLooks into his face.     And sighs. \nEXT. SHORELINE - DAY \nRear ANGLE of Agnis, crouching in the lightly falling snow. At the edge of the sea. The spot where she once sent her dog to rest. HEAR footfalls crunching slowly across the rocks. A bulky figure comes into frame. Crouches down beside her. Close. She stares at the gray horizon. \nQUOYLE (softly) Mavis Bangs. Told me where you'd be. \nNo answer.   But she hears him all right. \nQUOYLE We get so little mention in the wires. Thought you'd like to see. \nHe hands the folded print-out to her. \nQUOYLE Head in the suitcase.       The mystery's solved. \nShe looks briefly at his eyes.        Takes it.   Starts to read. \nQUOYLE Silver Melville was captured in Moored with a cruise steward. The boy was twenty, a looker, wearing Armani clothes. Driving a nice Lexus. \nAgnis keeps reading. \nShe's looking at her cup now.     Not at him. \nWAVEY Came back one summer.     Fell for Herold Prowse. That.      Was that. \nTakes a swallow.     Closes her eyes. \nWAVEY Did you know I was a liar? \nOpens her eyes.     Straight into his.     Did you? \nWAVEY Herold liked other women.     But you know how that is. \nSure you do. \nWAVEY (whispers) He didn't die. Not that he didn't deserve to. \nQuoyle blinks.     A perfect stunned ox gape. \nWAVEY See, I'm a good liar. \nDrains her cup. \nWAVEY He ran off to Seattle with some bitch. When his damaged son was two months old. And nobody knew. \nAn ice-cold wink. \nWAVEY Like I said. It's four years ago. And it's yesterday. \nPours herself another.     Savors the memory. \nWAVEY So I took his boat out. I sunk it. And told my little story. Grieving widow. \nShrugs a drunken, careless shrug. \nWAVEY I was leaving, of course. Why humiliate myself on the wayout? \nYes? \nWAVEY (softer) But a funny thing happened.        On \nmy way out. \nHer eyes are deeper now.      And for a beat, the anger slips away. \nWAVEY All these funny, odd little folks? They put their hearts around me. So I wouldn't be alone. Having lost the man I loved. \nSilence.   A real one. \nWAVEY And since I knew, to my shame, that is exactly what I had lost. I let go of the will to leave. I did. \nI did. \nWAVEY Decided to let my child grow up. Around folks better than his mom. \nStares in his eyes. \nWAVEY You're quite the talker. \nQUOYLE (quiet) I take pride in that. \nSo she smiles.     But the bitterness is there in it. \nWAVEY Well, this morning.     The man I loved. Came back. \nAnd the world. Ceases to spin.         One man's world, at least.   She watches that. Assesses it. \nWAVEY Told me he knew.     I loved him still. \nSips at her second drink.        Slides the rest of it down. \nWAVEY Okay. Now I'm drunk enough.         To talk about Petal. \nHer eyes ask.    Are you? \nWAVEY You're thinking we're kindred souls, you and me. In love with our nightmares. \nShakes her head.     Uh-uh. \nWAVEY You don't love your Petal. You hate. Her cheating. Guts. \nMeans those words as an opening blow.      Jacks or better.      Here comes the hole card... \nWAVEY You have to think it's love. Because if it's not, you're dead inside. So you keep that flame a flickering. Cos it's all you'll ever have. \nPure contempt.     And honesty. \nWAVEY You see.   You're a good liar, too. \nLifts the cap.     Screws it back on the bottle. \nWAVEY Where's the damn eggshells?     That's all I came to see. \nAnd from his prison of shock and shame.      He points to a shelf.      She is OFF his desk, like a panther... \n...SNATCHES the tiny padded box with its treasure.          RAISES it high to smash it, and... \n...stops.    To see the panic.    In his eyes. \nIt brings tears.     Pooling in hers. \nAnd she sets the treasure down, with the tenderness that decency requires. \nWAVEY Can you guess how I know about Petal? \nHe cannot. \nQuoyle and Alvin inspect Quoyle's newly-finished boat. It is a beauty, to be sure, and the old builder watches Quoyle lovingly running his hand across the smooth gunnel. Alvin doesn't smile. That's not his style. \nALVIN Gotta paint the name. What'll it be? 'The Tall And Quiet Woman'? \nQuoyle glances over.     The old boy's eyes are dancing. \nQUOYLE You knew Billy's dad? \nALVIN Ever'body knows ever'body. But Billy's pap didn't invent the Four Women in a Man's Life. \nQuoyle nods.   Guess not. \nALVIN Well. Which one is Bunny, I wonder? The Maid in the Meadow, mebbe. \nBut Yoda is just staring at him.     And quietly... \nALVIN Doncha know? They're all the same woman. That's the point. \nHis pupil blinks.   Like a crystal bullet of clarity his brain. \nALVIN The Maid in the Meadow, that's her innocence and play. The Stouthearted Woman, is when you need to lean on her. \nFor some reason he could never name.     Tears are pooling in eyes. \nALVIN The Tall and Quiet Woman? That's the silent partner who always walks 'longside, so's yer never alone. \nQuoyle is nodding, now.     It all seems so right. \nALVIN And the Demon Lover. That's just the frostin' on th' cake. \nA soft knocking at the door. \nALVIN When y'find the woman who's all four? That's when y'got yer one true love. \nThe bird-like woman enters.     The old man nods toward her. \nALVIN ...like m'Gertie. \nBut she isn't alone. A man enters behind her. It is Dennis Buggit. And there are tears on his face. He brings a dreadful silence with him, because the face is an open grave. \nDENNIS My dad went over the side this mornin'. Tangled in th' sling- stone line. \nA sob escapes from this strong man's throat.    He ignores it.    No one knows what to say. \nDENNIS If you could write a memorial t' him. Fer t'morrow's Gammy Bird? I'd be real grateful. \nEXT. JACK BUGGIT'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagons Folks still streaming toward the brightly-lit house. Ever'body knows ever'body. \nINT. JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nEvery room is filled with folks who wear their best. There is eating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter, as we move through the crowd. As if some have taken hold of a wake's well- meaning purpose. Others stand dazed, still wearing their pain and confusion. There are children here, some hold a parent's hand, some giggle with each other. Snapshot of a community. Struggling to cope. \nQuoyle and Bunny enter, holding hands, looking around.      As they cross the room... \n...two figures step into their path. Two women holding hands, their bodies close together. Their feeling for each other open for all to see. One is Agnis. And the other. Isn't Mavis Bangs. \nDAWN Happy New Year, Mr. Quoyle. I'm sorry I missed you at the pageant. \nSlightly startled, Quoyle can't help but smile, despite the solemn occasion. At the proud look on his aunt's face. \nDAWN I was in the wings, a course. Wasn't our girl somethin'? \nOur girl, a course, is Agnis.   Who nearly blushes at the compliment. \nDAWN I say, y'have t'love a woman. Who's in touch with her inner chicken. \nWell, who could argue with that. Dawn leans up, kisses Quoyle on the cheek. And with surprising softness... \nAGNIS Nephew.   You okay? \nBUNNY He's okay.     He's not sleeping in the box. \nHer great aunt looks at this child. Bends to plant an unexpected kiss on the top of Bunny's head. The kid squirms, tugs her dad firmly off, as he sends a parting wave. \nInto the parlor now. Quieter here, as the new arrivals thread past Jack Buggit in his open coffin, resting on black-draped sawhorses. Dennis and his mom stand by Jack, a hand and a word for each. And moving into the line... \nQUOYLE Remember what I told you. \nHis words a murmur.     Hers are bolder... \nBUNNY If he's not sleeping.     Why do they call it a awake? \nHe thinks.   As if it is a worthwhile question. \nQUOYLE We're the ones have to be awake. To how much we love him... \nNods to himself.     Yes. \nQUOYLE And how we should be good to each other. While we have the chance. \nHe looks down.     They are almost there. \nQUOYLE You think? \nShe is thinking. Keeping the thoughts to herself. At the coffin now, he lifts her up to see. Jack lies motionless, a wax figure of himself. Serene behind violet eyelids. \nBUNNY He looks like he's sleeping. \nDennis looks over.     His stolid, grim face releases a smile for his friend. \nQUOYLE That's cos he's peaceful. No worries, anymore. No troubles. \nHe sets her down.     Clasps Mrs. Buggit's hand.     And from his \n", "test1_input": "Drunken, devilish smile.     Quoyle turns, innocent questioning eyes. You got a boat? \nNUTBEEM I built a Chinese junk. Sailed it up from Brazil. Missed Manhattan by a mile or so, got stranded here when I shipwrecked by Gaze Island. \nSo casual and falsely modest, Quoyle's eyes are big. \nNUTBEEM Almost finished my repairs. Be leaving soon. As paleontologists define the term. \nStudies Quoyle's amazement.     Confides... \nNUTBEEM She's ugly. And the only thing I've ever loved. \nDennis rises.   Belches. \nDENNIS Yer story tugs at me bladder. \nAnd off he lurches to correct the situation.       Once he's gone... \nQUOYLE Him and Jack. Tell it. \nTheir eyes meet.     The Brit sighs. \nNUTBEEM Jack Buggit's psychic, start with that. He's got the gift. Specially about the sea. \nThinking. Should he tell it?      Quoyle makes a rolling hand motion, hurry it up. \nNUTBEEM Older brother Jesson, everyone's favorite, even Dennis'. Goes to sea like his dad. One day, rest of the family's sitting by the radio, and Jack goes white... \nThat's right. \nNUTBEEM Stands up. Says, Jesson's gone. Walks out of the house. Grief too big for walls to hold it. \nSets down the burger.     Runs a finger down the frost on his beer mug. \nNUTBEEM So Dennis is forbidden the sea. But being free, Newfie, and 21, he goes anyway. \nQUOYLE And that's enough t...? \nNUTBEEM Death storm. Monster wave cracks her steel hull amidships, one inch crack from starboard to port. Men go in the water. Dennis lost. After a week... \nA week. \nNUTBEEM They come to Jack, call off the search. He stands like a stone. Then turns, sharp, the way he does. Says only, 'He's alive. And I know where.' \nQUOYLE Man's a witch. \nNUTBEEM Went to sea, alone, in just a skiff. Finds him. Can you guess the odds? Finds him. Finds him. Both arms broke, 99% dead. \nLeans.    Close. \nNUTBEEM Boy comes to. Jack says if you ever \nstep in a boat again, I'll drown ya m'self. And you know what the kid said...? \nQuoyle glances over.      Dennis wobbling his way back through the tables. \nQUOYLE Say it fast. \nNUTBEEM Says fishin' licenses are all spoken for, I'd appreciate you givin' me yours. Jack looked in his eyes. They never spoke ag... \nDENNIS What's bein' blabbed here? \nNUTBEEM (not missing a beat) Quoyle says you got a nice ass. \nDENNIS Quoyle's right. \nHe raises his beer. \nDENNIS To my ass. \nQUOYLE I'll drink to that. \nAnd, by God.   They do. \nEXT. WAVEY'S YARD - AFTERNOON \nQuoyle and Bunny climb out of the wagon. A small house, its grassy yard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures, galloping horses, dogs balanced on wheels, a row of chrome hubcaps on sticks. A zoo of the mind. To one side, a table piled with crafts, ignored by... \n...fifteen LITTLE KIDS running in all directions, like bundled, unbridled banshees. Looks like fun. Two harried MOTHERS are trying to cope with the chaos. And there, under a tree... \n...the honey-haired WOMAN Quoyle had seen on the ferry. And in the rain. She is on her knees, tying the shoes of her vacant-faced SON. He trips and sprawls, but he is laughing. The woman smiles tenderly and tousles his brown-straw hair. \nQuoyle gets up his courage. Walks Bunny over to them.       As we arrive, the woman looks up... \nQUOYLE (really nervous) Hullo.     It's our first day, and I \nwas wond... \nBUNNY What's wrong with him? \nQuoyle freezes.    She means, of course, the blankly-staring boy. \nQUOYLE Hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong with you? There's nothing wr... \nWOMAN (to Bunny, softly) Sure, there is. This is Herry, and he has Down's Syndrome. It means he learns things very slowly. \nOh.   HERRY smiles at Bunny.      Suddenly, wonderfully. \nBUNNY (to Herry) Know how to be a dog? \nShe DROPS to all fours and starts YAPPING like a terrier. Herry LAUGHS with delight. Tumbles down to the grass and does his impression of a Chihuahua on speed. \nBUNNY (to the woman) He looks fast to me. Maybe he's cured. \nWOMAN Maybe. \n", "test1_true": "QUOYLE Which one of those women is in charge here? \nThe woman looks at him. Clear cornflower eyes. As comfortable in silence as he is agonized. Then, she squints out at the other women, desperately running ragged after the kids. \nWOMAN Neither of 'em.      They're just moms. \nOh. \nQUOYLE Well, my lord, whoever runs the place should be giving this a little more attention. \nShe looks back at him, blankly. \nWOMAN You think. \nQUOYLE I mean, children need structure. No one's even guarding that craft table, they could be running around with scissors and get hurt. \nThe woman's eyes bottomless, unreadable.       The silence excruciating for poor Quoyle. He clears his throat. \nQUOYLE Um.   I write for the newspa... \nBut she stands.    The grace and quickness of a jungle cat. \nWOMAN Well. I'd better get to work, I see. Providing structure and all. \nBrushes off her skirt.       He is in the dawning panic of beginning to realize... \nWAVEY I'm Wavey Prowse, and this is my place. Pardon our antiquated emphasis on individuality and the freedom to have fun. \nHeads off with a loose-limbed stride.       Spins back around... \nWAVEY Oh, yeh.     Running with sharp objects?     We save for Tuesdays. \nGot it? He gawks like a stupid animal.        Nods, got it.   She's already gone. \nEXT. BARGE DECK - DAY \nQuoyle and Billy Pretty stroll the teak deck of a massive, elegantly-outfitted BARGE. The wiry little fellow keeps his smile to his eyes... \nBILLY Well, she don't wear a ring, cause she lost her husband at sea. Just after the boy was born. \nOh.   Quoyle nods, blandly.      As if it is a matter of no real concern \nQUOYLE Well, I was just... \nBILLY ...sharpenin' those observation skills. First tool of a quality reporter. \nKeep walking. \nQUOYLE She has wonderful.     Posture. \nBILLY (has to smile) Yer know, I never notic... \nMELVILLE (O.S.) JESUS F. CHRIST! YOU BOYS WANT THIS STORY OR NOT? \nLook up ahead to the bow, where a rolling bar has been set up. BAYONET MELVILLE is mixing drinks. He has a florid face and striking white hair. Dapper, arrogant, a guy with more money than he's worked for. As we approach... \nMELVILLE Ever seen anything like her? \nQuoyle looks to the sour-faced middle-aged lady, who glances disdainfully at us above her gimlet. SILVER MELVILLE used to be pretty and rich. She's still rich. \nQUOYLE (politely) No sir, your wife is very lovl... \nMELVILLE I mean.   The ship. \nOh.   Billy keeps a straight face.     Silver ROLLS her eyes. \nMELVILLE It was built for Hitler. You've heard of Hitler? Up here in Canada? \nQUOYLE Oh, yessir. He was in all the papers. Way back. \nSilver snorts a laugh. Melville wonders if that was irony. Looking at Quoyle, he doubts that's possible. \nMELVILLE Finest botterjacht ever built in Holland. Flat-bottomed, she can go right up on shore in a storm. Incredibly heavy, forty tons of oak. Not unlike the barges of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. \nBILLY (helpful) We heard a them, too. \nSILVER Tell them what happened.     In \nHurricane Bob. \nHe looks at his wife. Clear in a glance they hate each other's guts. Go on, she nods. Tell it. \nMELVILLE Pounded twelve beach houses. Expensive ones. To rubble. \nSILVER WHAMM! \nDrunk and mean.    And smarter than he is. \nSILVER Now tell them. Who let our insurance lapse. \nSilence. \nSILVER Took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us out of it. An inch from bankruptcy. \nShe winks. \nSILVER Moral of the story? When you marry a tour guide. Confine his authority to mixing the drinks. Same again, dear? \nAnd holds out her glass.       Billy looks out to sea.   Like he hasn't heard this. \nQUOYLE (cheerful) So. What brings you folks up from Long Island? \nA beat.    While husband and wife glare at each other. \nSILVER My dining salon needs refitting. And the best custom yacht upholsterer in the Northern Hemisphere just moved here. I was forced. To follow. \n", "test2_input": "INTERCUT...a winch pulling part of the Geo, streaming mud, from swiftly flowing water. Police and bystanders gathered. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) And I wondered. Am I going where she's gone? \nBACK to the bay. A barely-conscious Quoyle still clings somehow to the plastic cooler. But hours have passed. Light is fading. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) ...and will I see her? \nHe turns. And there she is. Beaming at him from the bow of her little rowboat, a smile ambiguous in the growing dusk. It could be love. From behind her a light GLOWS, giving Petal the aspect of an angel. \nShe drops a wink.   FADES away.    And the light becomes... \n...the BEAM from a fishing boat. Quoyle squints his swollen eyes, as strong hands WRENCH him from his box. From the sea. A voice warbles, distorted by wind and Quoyle's diminished consciousness... \nJACK Jesus Cockadoodle Christ!     I knowed somebody was out here. \nQuoyle's teeth are chattering so hard, his body shivering so \npainfully, Buggit hauls him over the rail and lays him down on a wriggling mound of fish. \nJACK Thank god fer yer figure, me old son. A thin man woulda froze. \nQuoyle burrows into the fish, like nestling in a down comforter. Jack covers him with a heavy tarp. Crouches down close... \nJACK Good.   Yer lost th'boat. \nINT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nDim light. Quoyle stirs beneath the billowing down coverlet.   His eyes flutter. Open. Where...? \nVOICE (O.S., very soft) It's all right. You're in heaven. \nHis head SNAPS around. She's sitting just beside the bed in half- shadow. Her oxblood knitting across her lap. \nWAVEY Actually.    It's just my bed. \nNow he sees the cigarette. \nWAVEY Actually, it's not. I just wanted to see your eyes bug out like that. \nNow he sees the smile. \nQUOYLE You don't smoke. \nHis voice was a croak. So he CLEARS his throat with a massive and disgusting effort. It is gross and funny, and she smiles again. \nWAVEY Only when I'm worried.      I don't worry much. \nHe rolls over, to see her better.      They are very close. \nQUOYLE You don't have to, I'm all right. I'm in heaven. \nWAVEY I'm not worried.    About you. \nOh.   As he draws a breath to ask... \nWAVEY \nYou're in the boys' room at Jack's house. Wonder how long since Dennis slept here. \nShe glances to the nightstand. Beneath the dim lamp.       A picture of Jack and blond son Jesson. Guess what they're doing. \nWAVEY Mrs. Buggit called, knew Bunny was still with me. The kids are camped out in the parlor. \nA beat. \nQUOYLE Nice.   You sittin' up with me. \nA longer one. \nWAVEY S'okay. Someday you'll do somethin' nice for me. \nHe nods.   He will. \nQUOYLE Who you worried ab... \nWAVEY You didn't find a second dead man. Just the rest of the first one. \nAh.   He nods.   Well, that figures. \nQUOYLE I asked.   Who you worried about? \nOn this, she stubs out her cigarette.      Takes another from the pack. \nWAVEY You said Bunny talks to Petal at night. You ever listen? \nHe shakes his head. \nQUOYLE Not really. Wouldn't be right. \nWAVEY Well, I'm not that nice a person. \nSTRIKES a match. \nWAVEY She plays Petal. Talks to the Barbies, like Petal talking to her. \nBrings her cigarette.   To the flame. \nWAVEY She says she's sorry she left them. It was just to see if they could be good girls. And they were... \nAnd. \nWAVEY ...and she loves them. \nHis eyes at once rapt and suffering.     She watches that. \n", "test2_true": "Draws on her smoke. \nWAVEY So we talked. Just before Petal left her with that...stranger? Bunny had snapped her mom's bead necklace. That's why she's making more. \nDo you understand? \nWAVEY When she's made enough.     She'll be forgiven. \nTears are pooling in his eyes.   Hers, too.     She keeps going... \nWAVEY She saves Petal a room at the house, but she's also got the key to the old place. In case her mom would rather go there. \nA thin stream of air escapes from his lips. \nQUOYLE And she talked about it.      Just like that. \nWAVEY Sure, I lied. I said nice things about her mother. \nBitter smile. \nWAVEY See, there's only one problem. Petal isn't gone. \nQuoyle thinking.     Madly.   What can he do? \nQUOYLE So we're patient. And we wait, and we're good to her. (beat) And. Maybe. Time. \nShe stares back.     Unease to match his own.   Maybe time. \nINT. ALVIN YARK'S BOAT HOUSE - DAY \nA wiry wisp of an aged elf, ALVIN YARK is shaping the center beam of what will become a tidy boat. Its wooden skeleton across two sawhorses in his spacious workshop. \nALVIN (sings softly to himself) Oh, the Gandy Goose, it ain't no use. It ain't no use, the Gandy Goose. \nQuoyle, Wavey and Dennis stand in a row. Watching the little artisan shave wood as if his tools were his hands. \nALVIN (keeps singing, as if alone) The Gandy Goose, she ain't no uuuuse... Cause all her nuts'n bolts is loose. \nWavey can't help but smile.      She really likes the old duck. \nALVIN (never turning) See, I'm already buildin' yers in me mind. The singin' helps that. But. Gotta take a walk in the woods, find a spruce with jest th' right curve fer yer stem. \nAnd says no more. Keeps working. They are like acolytes at the feet of a guru who never bothers even to glance their way. \nQUOYLE Well, hurry up. Thirty, forty years I'll be rarin' to get back out on the water. \nEveryone smiles.     Except the guru. \nALVIN Gotta build her solid. Who knows, mebbe Jack Buggit'll give his fishin' license to his boy. So next time, won't be nobody to pull yer out. \nDENNIS (real quiet) Jack Buggit's boy is drowned. \nEveryone looks.     Except the guru. \nALVIN (cheery) Dennis. Y'hear the one about the Newfie who lived ferever? \nA beat. \nDENNIS No sir. \nALVIN His kid never got a fishin' license. \nNow he turns.     A maritime Yoda, squinting to discern if his message is received. \nALVIN What we wait fer? She's like the main stem. Gives us our shape, doncha see. \nHe runs his hand along the backbone of the boat he's building. \nALVIN Death's one shape.     Fergiveness is another. \nCrinkly old eyes, laser bright.        Dennis isn't angry.       Just resolved. \nDENNIS Thing 'bout waitin' on fergiveness? Mixes up who's waitin' on who. \nNo smile, no spin.     Just the truth. \nDENNIS Death is simpler.     An' a lot shorter wait. \nIn the silence.     A door opens. \nMRS. YARK (O.S.) Mr. Quoyle...? \nA sprightly bird-like woman.        Wears apology and concern. \nMRS. YARK The school is callin'?     It's about yer daughter? \nINT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE \nThe PRINCIPAL is spare, dressed for England, her voice authoritarian by its pace, exaggerated diction, and lack of volume. \nPRINCIPAL ...not only pushed Mrs. Lumball.        Not \nonly pushed her very hard... \nSeated in a semi-circle around the desk of power. Quoyle, stricken, respectful. Wavey, already pissed off at the principal. And Bunny,her hat and coat on, arms folded, face crimson and set. \nPRINCIPAL She knocked. Her down. \nDo you understand the severity of this, Mr.       Quoyle? \nPRINCIPAL And. Refuses to explain her act.      Or. Apologize. \nIs that right, young lady? \nPRINCIPAL Under the circumstances.     We have no choice but to suspend. \n", "test3_input": "QUOYLE Three hours to drive from the Point, with all the ice. Alvin won't have my boat ready til New Years. Agnis can stay over her shop. Bunny and I have to find a room in town. \nDENNIS Stay with us. My kid follows yours around, they'll bunk t'gether. And we gotta fluffy couch that's more'n you deserve. \nA good friend.     Quoyle is touched. \nQUOYLE \nHopin' you'd offer, almost worth it just t'inconvenience ya. Unfortunately, I'm too fond a yer wife. \nNUTBEEM (casual) Take my trailer. Timing's perfect. \nThe way he said that.     They both turn.     A shrug... \nNUTBEEM It's two years. My boat's ready. If I stay any longer, I'll begin to like it here. \nWouldn't want that. Very silent at this table.            Against the din of the place. Is he serious? \nNUTBEEM (softly) I'm throwing myself a farewell party on Saturday. Departure to follow Sunday. Regrets, soon after, no doubt. \nAnd smiles.    Serious as a heart attack.      A long beat. \nQUOYLE (a murmur) Be careful. \nCareful? \nQUOYLE Last friend left me.      Turned into a truck driver. \nSo much feeling behind his eyes.     Nutbeem can only say... \nNUTBEEM Well.   With that warning. \nAnd return the feeling.     With his own. \nEXT./INT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - TWILIGHT \nQuoyle GROANING under the weight of cases of beer and cheap rum pulled from the back of his wagon. Plenty more to go. Staggers into... \n...Nutbeem's   tiny, threadbare trailer. Every conceivable surface under stacks   of plastic-wrapped party platters of cold cuts, cheese and red-eyed   olives. Nutbeem is jamming beers into tubs of ice. Quoyle peers   into the teensy closet that is the only bathroom... \nQUOYLE What's the barrel for? \nSEE it now.    Half a sawed-off empty BARREL, with MOLASSES stenciled \nin orange, fills the shower stall. \nNUTBEEM I'm British. I bathe. \nQuoyle sends him a blank look. \nQUOYLE Perfect for th' chips. \nHe gestures to thirty bags of potato chips, filling the kitchenette. \nNUTBEEM It's coated with two kinds of scum. Soap. And mine. \nQUOYLE Works.    We forgot to buy dip. \nINT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nVIEW out a window at the line of HEADLIGHTS still arriving. We are immersed in the ungodly WHITE NOISE of an all-gentleman's Newfie soiree, music pushed beyond the level of distortion, assorted grunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking. As we struggle to look around... \n...every square inch is    crammed tight with semi-conscious drunks. Tert Card and some boys    circle the potato chip barrel, which has become a handy urinal.     Near the door, Dennis holding forth, arm tight around Quoyle who    listens, listens, chuckles. Then Quoyle fights his way... \n...OUT of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is MUCH wilder, given the elbow room. Quoyle steps OVER the supine form o Billy Pretty, who is singing to himself. Finds Jack Buggit with a beer in one hand a rum in the other. Wraps a drunken arm around Jack's neck. Starts to talk in his ear. Jack looks suspicious. A FIGHT breaks out a few feet away. They don't notice. Closing in, to hear... \nQUOYLE (shouting against the din) SO THE NEXT DAY, THEY ALL SIT DOWN ON THE GIRDER. THE BRIT OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX. 'OH, NO! SCOTCH SALMON AGAIN! FAREWELL, BOYS!' AND HE JUMPS OFF THE GIRDER TO HIS DEATH. \nJack nods.   Grins.    That's pretty funny. \nQUOYLE THE QUEBEC GUY OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX. 'MON DIEU! MEAT PIE AGAIN! AU REVOIR CRUEL WORLD!' AND HE JUMPS. \nThis.   Is even funnier. \nQUOYLE NOW THE STATIE IS ALL ALONE ON THE GIRDER. HE OPENS HIS BOX. 'HOLY MOLEY! BOLOGNA SANDWICH AGAIN! I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS!' AND LEAPS OFF. \nFunniest yet.   Jack is chuckling already. \nQUOYLE AT THE FUNERAL. THE BRIT' S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME HE HATED SALMON?' FRENCHY'S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY DIDN'T HE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MEAT PIE?' STATIE'S WIFE SAYS, 'I DON'T GET IT. HE ALWAYS MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!' \nQuoyle is chortling.   But Jack stares him dead in the eyes. \nJACK YOU'RE SURE. THE FELLER WAS A STATIE. \nQUOYLE OH, YAR.    FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. \nAt which point Jack BUSTS OUT laughing fit to wet his pants... \nJACK MADE HIS OWN LUNCH! \nPOUNDING on poor Quoyle, who is also dissolved in hysterics. Nearby, the biggest and ugliest GUY at the party (no small distinction) leaps onto a tree stump brandishing an AXE. Even in this crowd, it commands a certain degree of attention. \nBIG UGLY GUY NOW WE ALL LOVES OLD FOOKIN' NUTBEEM, YAR??? \nCries of YAR! fill the woods. Nutbeem himself is HOISTED on shoulders, whooping and sloshing his grog. \nBIG UGLY GUY SO LESS KEEP 'IM 'ERE BYES! AXE 'IS FOOKIN' BOAT! GOT YER CHAIN SAW, NEDDIE?? \nAn idea that wins IMMEDIATE MASS APPROVAL. Soused Nutbeem's eyes open bug-wide, as he is borne in a tidal wave of mayhem toward the docks. Whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective. \nAnd rather suddenly.   Quoyle is left alone. \nAmong the conscious, that is. \nINT. WAVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "There is a feeling of empowerment and release in Herry. His grin splits his round face. His eyes say that his heart is dancing. \nPULL SLOWLY BACK...through the window, past the porch, across the front yard. To a figure. By the fence. He stands motionless. Except his foot is tapping, very slightly, to the time of the music. \nWe can't tell how much Quoyle sees.    But his eyes say that his heart is drowning. \nEXT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - MORNING \nAs Quoyle shuffles up, we see Nutbeem's trailer has been turned completely OVER onto its side. Walls are crushed and splintered. It's a train wreck. \nSitting on the cinder blocks that once supported it, Nutbeem, and Dennis swig beers. \nNUTBEEM (cheery) You're looking dishy, Q. \nQUOYLE Feeling that and more.    What's the situation? \nNutbeem hands him a beer. \nNUTBEEM One. You're moving in with Dennis, no matter how fond you are of his wife. \nQuoyle looks sadly at the trailer.    Realizing it was his place that got trashed. \nNUTBEEM (laughs) And the boat! Omigod! \nBILLY I'm some disgusted.    With the human race. \nNUTBEEM I'da never made it, anyway. Storms would have blown me to bits. You boys saved my life. Yes, you did. \nThe boys look at each other.    Humiliated by his generosity. \nNUTBEEM \nI've gathered my savings, and am flying to Brazil. Where water is swimming pool green. And I grill yellowtail steaks with lime and garlic, watercress and Tobasco. Touch of curry. What? \nQuoyle is looking at him somewhat strangely. \nQUOYLE (light) I collect friends who cook.     Just can't keep 'em. \nMaybe too light not to be obvious.     Billy looks from Quoyle to the trailer. And back. \nBILLY It's too bad. \nWhich seems to cover everything. \nEXT. JACK BUGGIT'S SKIFF - DAY \nQuoyle alone with Jack in open water. Pulling on a slicker, gloves, picking up a knife. Jack is pronging cod onto the deck. \nJACK Hands might as well be movin' while we chat. Always hated th' sight a grown men around a table workin' nuthin' but their jaws. \nAnd so, together, they begin to clean a small mountain of cod. \nQUOYLE Editorial meetin', y'say.     'Bout what? \nJACK Well, Tert Card's gone, fer one thing. \nDoesn't look up. \nJACK Yar, I know, he never said g'bye. Well, don't get all weepy-eyed about it, old son. Try t'be a man. \nQuoyle will. \nJACK They called him from St. John's, he tells me. Wants him to help put out th' newsletter fer them oil rig suppliers. \nYup.     Believe it. \nJACK He was sassy an' he was smug. Oh, there's a waitin' list, he assures me. They only skims th' cream. \nQUOYLE Well, don't get all weepy-eyed abou... \nJACK Truth t'tell. I was a wee help. B'hind the scenes, doncha know. \nKeeps working. \nJACK (quietly) Sometimes.     Enough is enough. \nNo arguments arise. \nQUOYLE Well, Billy'll do a helluva job... \nJACK (nods) ...right where he is. Too old a fish t'swim faster'n be wants. Gotta find someone a little dumber t'take on a shit job like this! \nUh-oh.     You don't mean... \nJACK Spot I'm in, Christmas and all. Might have to offer th'mess. To you. \nQuoyle swallows.       Arguably the proudest moment of his life. \nQUOYLE Course.     I'd need a raise. \nJack looks at him for the first time.        A real twinkle behind... \nJACK Y'know. Yer do have the sense God gave a doughnut. \nQUOYLE (genuinely touched) I'II try to live up to that. \nSaid with such sincerity, Jack can only nod.          Good. \nJACK Any other outrageous demands? Seein' as yer got me over a barrel. Here's your one chance. \nAnd before he can stop his mouth... \nQUOYLE Well, your son... \nThe mirth dies in his host's eyes. Like a 60-watt bulb in a brownout. Quoyle swallows the rest. \n"}

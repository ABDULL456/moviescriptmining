{"test1_input": "THE SHIPPING NEWS \nRon Bass Third Draft Rewrite February 23, 1999 \nPrevious Drafts By: Laura Jones Beth Henley \nINT. LAUNDROMAT, MOCKINGBURG, NEW YORK - NIGHT \nGlaring fluorescence, trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes, empty Coke machine flashing all lights orange. Only two dryers are humming. It's very late. Keep PANNING to... \n...a wiry, gimlet-eyed WOMAN, furtively removing crumpled newspapers from a dryer. She flattens and folds them meticulously, her glance darting angrily everywhere. Top secret mission. \n...a natty little black man. PARTRIDGE has spread a late supper on a neat cloth atop a dryer. Small cold fowl. Brie, baguette, olives. Bottle of red. An air of competence, of indomitable upbeatness. He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she were normal. More curious about... \n...a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as if cramming for life's midterm exam. Thoughtful. Circles one, slowly. Set out on QUOYLE's dryer are one Snickers bar and four empty snickers wrappers. His version of cold supper. He reaches for the candy, but seeing it's the last one, he... \n...rises. Goes to the candy machine. Drops in his 65 cents, hits the button. The Snickers starts to fall, but gets caught in the mechanism at the last moment. Quoyle blinks dully. One more retelling of the story of his life. He BANGS the machine half- heartedly. Nope. Shakes it with his shambling strength. Nada. POUNDS the coin return button. Hat trick. He empties his pocket. Studies the results. Not enough. And without so much as a sigh... \n...he ambles back to his dryer. Starts to unwrap the last Snickers. Partridge taking this all in. But Mata Hari of the Neat Newspapers goes to the candy machine, KICKS it violently. Out fall the Snickers and the 65 cents. She scoops up both, turns in a single motion to... \n...GLARE death at the enemy. Quoyle opens his mouth to comment. But. Doesn't. Resumes unwrapping his supper, as... \n...his dryer STOPS. He pops it open. Stares in. Blinks. Suddenly YANKS a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floor to reveal they have been... \n...STAINED streaky BLUE by a cheap pen, quietly melting amid the pile. This slips beneath even Quoyle's expectation level. The big, soft face is pitifully, yes, even adorably, devastated. \nQUOYLE (a murmur) Ruined. \nAnd to the bystander.     This seems a comment on more than shirts. \nPARTRIDGE (softly) Nah. Rub the ink with hot salt and talcum powder. \nQuoyle's head WHIPS around.     As if he thought he was alone. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) If you're shocked when someone aims kindness your way. That oughta tell you somethin' about yourself. \nWatches the little guy's undemanding smile. \nQUOYLE (V.O., just staring) Then again. If you're that kinda guy. It don't. \nPARTRIDGE And put a cuppa bleach in, next time through. \nAs Quoyle gazes at his benefactor, the woman sneaks up, SNATCHES his Help Wanted ads. Races them over to her dryer. As the boys watch, she shoves them in, starts the machine with Quoyle's coins, and glares fiercely back at us. A mother bear protecting her cubs. Partridge chuckles. Holds out his hand... \nPARTRIDGE Partridge. \nQuoyle glances at the little man's cold fowl supper. \nQUOYLE Uh.   No thanks. \nPARTRIDGE It's my name. \nOh. \nINT. MOCKINGBURG RECORD CITY ROOM - DAY \nShabby one-floor newspaper. Old equipment, listless personnel, stale you can smell from here. Only guy working is Partridge, who is laying out the front page, and glances up to see across the floor... \n...Quoyle enter in his best suit. It is also his worst suit. Partridge points to the only enclosed office, and gives his buddy a hearty thumbs-up. Quoyle nods, his smile a rictus, his eyes a glaze of panic. We see now that he is chewing, somehow. On the way into the office, he snags a doughnut from a paper plate by the coffee. Enters... \nINT. ED PUNCH'S OFFICE - DAY \n...ED PUNCH, managing editor, looks up from a reverie with a startled expression. He wears really thick glasses which MAGNIFY his eyes, giving him a frightening aspect. \nPUNCH \nQuoyle?     You're early. \nFrom the rear, we see Quoyle can barely squeeze himself into the chair. \nPUNCH I don't like that. \nAll the change SPILLS out of Quoyle's pockets, and CLATTERS onto the wood floor, ROLLING interminably, as Quoyle fidgets. \nPUNCH Partridge says you're not as dumb as you look. \nREVERSE ANGLE now to see Quoyle's face.        The neat moustache of powdered sugar. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) How could I be? \nAnd takes a healthy bite from what's left of the doughnut. \nPUNCH Anyway, that's why I'm takin' a chance on you. Partridge said he'd re-write whatever of your stuff. Stay late... \nQuoyle nods, dumbly.     Knows this. \nPUNCH We're a family paper. Upbeat stories with a community slant. Self-help stuff: Are You a Break- fast Alcoholic?...Guide to Getting Dumped...like that. \nQuoyle nods bigger. Like he gets it.         Punch shoves an antique tape recorder across the table. \nPUNCH City Planning Board meeting at two- thirty. Three hunnerd words max. Sink or swim. \nHOLD on Quoyle's eyes.      Recalling... \nFLASHBACK:   EXT. PUBLIC POOL - DAY \n...Quoyle as a fat kid in a baggy bathing suit, being savagely pummeled by his vicious OLDER BROTHER... \nQUOYLE (V.O.) I think my brother said that once. \nBROTHER LARDASS!     SNOTFACE!    FARTBAG! \nBeing pulled off the sniveling Quoyle by a rough hairy man with dead eyes. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) Maybe it was my father. \n", "test1_true": "FATHER Sink or swim, pig-butt. \nWatches the THRASHING with mild contempt.     Turns away before Quoyle simply SINKS beneath the surface. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) I'm not a water person. \nINT. CITY ROOM - LATE NIGHT \nThe empty room a haven of dust motes floating in sickly fluor- escence. Quoyle sits across the desk, gazing with endearing fearfulness as Partridge turns page after page... \nPARTRIDGE See, three hunnerd words would be, like, one page. This is...oh, fifteen, sixteen. \nQUOYLE So we should cut it. \nPartridge does glance up on that. \nPARTRIDGE Gonna have to. \nQUOYLE Or you could tie me in a sack, throw me in the river. Tell the police you thought it was oddly-wrapped lard. \nPARTRIDGE Might be quicker. \nNobody smiles. Nobody has to. Quoyle pulls a big glass jar from a paper sack. Sets it on the desk. \nQUOYLE Does your wife like special pickles? They're fine with cold cuts. \nPartridge looks at the cornichons.     They look expensive. \nPARTRIDGE Come by for supper, tomorrow.     We'll \nfind out. \nDISSOLVE to... \nEXT. PARTRIDGE'S BACK YARD - DAY \nSausages on the BBQ, interesting colors and sizes. A huge hand delicately places cut-up pieces of quail on the grill. It is Quoyle, trusted, paying attention. MERCALIA, a slim black woman with fiery eyes and an enticing smile, hands him a glass of white wine, and... \n...goes to slip her arm around Partridge. He watches Quoyle's concentration approvingly. Shares a smile with his sexy wife.       And raps a knife on his glass. Announcement. \nQuoyle looks up with innocent eyes.         Which makes Partridge hesitate. \nPARTRIDGE We.     Got you this. \nMercalia takes out the package. Wrapped in tissue, a neat ribbon. She hands it to Quoyle, and leans up to kiss his cheek. Quoyle looks down at it, dumbfounded. A silence. \nMERCALIA It's...an anniversary present. Anniversary of our friendship. \nQuoyle smiles.     Sweet and slightly confused. \nQUOYLE Seven and a half month anniversary? \nHe starts to unwrap... \nPARTRIDGE Well.     Why wait? \n...a wristwatch.     A nice one.     He is overwhelmed, but still uncomprehending. \nMERCALIA It's because we're happy.      About something. \nAnd steals a glance at her husband. \nQUOYLE (BIG grin) You're havin' a baby! \nThat stops Partridge's face.        No more stalling... \nPARTRIDGE Mercalia and me are movin'. To California. Friday night. \nQuoyle so pole-axed he can't even lose the smile.    It just turns stupid and transparent. His friend swallows. \nPARTRIDGE You know she's been learnin' to drive a rig. She got the Oakland to New Orleans run. I'm gonna make her smoked duck sandwiches for the road. I can edit copy anywhere. \nQuoyle nodding slowly, smile still there. Yep. I guess y'can. Partridge sees that it's a death blow. Mercalia looks at her feet. \nPARTRIDGE Love's all that counts.   It's the engine of life. \nAs if parting advice. As if Quoyle should file that away.      So Quoyle nods some more. As if he will. \nPARTRIDGE We'll just. Stay in touch. \nOn this, Quoyle's smile deserts him. So Partridge reaches out his hand. Quoyle paralyzed, then takes it. CLOSE ON their handclasp, and DISSOLVE to... \nINT. DOUBLETREE MEETING ROOM - EVENING \n...a slender feminine hand.   Buried in Quoyle's. \nPETAL (O.S.) Petal Bear, Mr. Quoyle. \nPAN up to see her. Tiny, twitchy, moist ringlets. A gray-eyed predator. She looks around at the milling suits and their name tags. As if they were alternatives. \nPETAL Do you hate this shit, or what? \nQuoyle transfixed by her slight form in its loose but clingy wrapping. The smile that sees him again and flickers... \nPETAL What do you think? You want to marry me, don't you? \nDon't you? No answer. She laughs, as if at some off-color response. Runs hot fingers up his arm, leaning to his face... \nPETAL Buy me a drink somewhere, it's seven-thirty. I think I'm going to fuck you by ten. What do you think of that? \nQuoyle.   Blinks.     She laughs again.   Bright, like whiskey music. \nPETAL You are quite. The raconteur. \nINT. QUOYLE'S TRAILER - LATE NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 1722, "test2_input": "Card, who likes no one.   Doesn't like Quoyle, too. \nCARD There's your miserable desk, Quoyle. We've got no idea what yer s'posed to do. But Mr. Jack Buggit will drop by someday and enlighten us all. Til then... \nAnd he turns away. Through the swinging door.       SLAM.   Quiet. Except for Nutbeem's chuckle. \nEXT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY \nQuoyle pulls up beside the ancestral home. Agnis stands at the back of a rented truck, sorting through materials in the payload. Across a stretch of ground, Bunny is earnestly pretend-reading a book to Warren, who lies listlessly before her. \nQuoyle comes up behind Agnis.   He carries a newspaper and an excited air. \nQUOYLE Listen to this. 'Well, we see the postman has landed in jail for 45 days for throwing the mail in Killick-Claw Harbor. He said he had too much to deliver, and folks could just take a dip and help themselves.' \nHe looks up, eager for her reaction. She is still sorting through bolts of thick cloth, spools of heavy thread, odd mechanical devices. \nQUOYLE This is great stuff. 'A snowmobile mishap has taken the life of 78-year- old Rick Puff, who was on his way home from what the Widow Puff calls a 'screech-in and a carouse,' when his machine fell through the ice. A well- known accordion player, Mr. Puff had served four years in the 1970s for sexual assault on his daughters. Bet they aren't crying, either.' This Billy Pretty can really write! \nAGNIS (absently) ...passes as colorful. \nHe looks into the truck.      Sees all the stuff.   She surveys his puzzlement. \nAGNIS Nephew, we can't fix up the house proper on a journalist's wages. So I have un-retired. \nOh.   Absorbs that. \nQUOYLE From what? \nAGNIS Upholstery. Been sought after for 33 years, wherever I've lived. This should be the real test, huh? \nQuoyle nods. Could be that. The sudden sound of footsteps above them, makes him look up sharply, to see... \n...a fit young MAN in a toolbelt climbing down a ladder from the roof. The muscles of a stud, the shy smile of a boy, he waves a greeting and HOPS down the last six feet to the ground. \nAGNIS This is Dennis Buggit, master carpenter. \nDENNIS offers a hand, and a smile that says he's expecting to like you. Makes the sentiment contagious. \nDENNIS Only til I get my lobster license. I'm a fisherman in my soul. \nA strong handshake.   On both sides. \nDENNIS It's a Newfie thing, the compulsion to fish. Y'hear yesterday's tragedy \n'bout the Newfie who went ice fishin'? \nQuoyle hasn't. \nDENNIS Brought home 200 pounds of ice. His wife fried it. They both drowned. \nQuoyle laughs good and honest.      Dennis likes that. \nAGNIS With me workin', we'll need day care for Bunny after school. Turns out Dennis and his wife send their little girl to this wonderful saintly woman. How's that for us livin' a charmed life? \nQuoyle nods, if a bit cautious.      Dennis squints out across the bay. \nDENNIS Agnis says yer buyin' a boat. Sooner's prob'ly better'n lat... \nQUOYLE (quiet smile) I'm not buyin'. No boat. \nSounds pretty sure of that.      Punctures the amiable ambiance with a shard of silence. \nAGNIS Well, course we're buy... \nQUOYLE (to Dennis) Buggit, huh? Any kin to my boss on the Gammy Bird? \nThe silence.     Just got thunderous.   A full beat. \nDENNIS (low) Oh, yeh.   He's m'dad. \nEven the eyes glance down.      What is that?   In the wake of it... \nAGNIS (cheerful) Gonna chat up yer daughter, or just ignore her as usual? \nQuoyle nods. Better do that. Dennis sends a shy smile, as if apologizing for the awkwardness. Quoyle holds up a finger, be right back, and... \n...heads on over to where Bunny is reading to Warren. \nBUNNY Warren threw up in your sleeping bag. She's got a stomach problem. \nQuoyle takes a breath to answer, but stops.     He's caught a whiff. \nQUOYLE (V.O.) Headline.     Dog Fart Fells Freelance Reporter.     Promising Career Nipped in Bud. \nBUNNY It's called cancer. \nOh. Quoyle holds his face together, as Bunny strokes the limp Warren. Then, he crouches down... \n...strokes Warren, too.     Good dog. \nINT. GAMMY BIRD - MORNING \nQuoyle enters. Billy Pretty's on the phone, hand cupped over the receiver, like it's top secret. Nutbeem's tuning his ancient shortwave with a butter knife through the hole where a knob ought to be. And as Quoyle sets down his sack lunch and thermos, as he peels off his parka, he's staring straight into the eyes of... \n...Tert Card across the way. Wearing a wicked and mysterious smile. As Quoyle's butt lowers toward his chair... \nBOOMING VOICE (O.S.) ATTENTION QUOYLE! \nOuoyle JUMPS a foot.   Looks from Card to Billy to Nutbeem.    What's going on? \nBOOMING VOICE (O.S.) IT'S AN I.Q. TEST, ME OLD SON, AND YOU AIN'T EXCELLING! \nWHIPS around. Through the glass of the only private office, sits a rumpled codger with a bullhorn. JACK BUGGIT, has his rubber boots up on the desk, scale-spattered overalls over his compact, sinewy body. His hair is wisps and shocks, and his face is strewn with stubble split by a leprechaun's grin around a stained hand-rolled ciggie. \nJACK (into bullhorn) DOES PAYIN' YER SHAMEFUL WAGE ENTITLE ME TO A PERSONAL AUDIENCE? OR WOULDJA RATHER JUST STAND THERE AN' DROOL? \n", "test2_true": "Jack WAVING him in, with great energetic loops. The grin more rowdy than his boy's. But the charm is there and more so. Quoyle goes... \nCARD (O.S.) \nHold onto yer danglies, little sister. \n...closes the door behind him. Jack's eyes are crinkly blue.   They study Quoyle good. And right in his face... \nJACK (into bullhorn) I PREDICT! A COCKADOODLE-BRIGHT FUTURE IN JOURNALISM! \nQUOYLE Based on my I.Q. test, huh.   Where'd I rate? \nJACK (sets the bullhorn down) Advanced squirrel. This ties you with me, an' I own the place. \nHolds out a brown fisherman's hand.   Quoyle takes it. \nJACK Pleased t'meetcha, Billy says yer workin' out. \nA wink. \nJACK Tert Card says he's keepin' an eye on ya. Since he's a self-servin' liar, helluva ad salesman tho, it means he's jealous. And Nutbeem... \nLifts the bullhorn... \nJACK (into bullhorn) NUTBEEM'S TEMPORARY ANYWAY! YOU HEAR THAT NUTBEEM! \nNUTBEEM (O.S., through glass) WITH PROFOUND RELIEF! \nJack's grin grows a twinkle.   Soft spot for the Brit. \nJACK Nutbeem's obsessed with actual news. Makes up for it by manning the sexual abuse desk. Can't keep up with the volume there, we're runnin' three, four a week. \nLeans forward.   Like he's dishing the lowdown. \nJACK Card's in charge. Ya hear this and that 'bout his typos, but typos is part of Gammy Bird. Everyone gets a laugh, and gets to figger 'em out. \nBetter'n a crossword. \nStabs out his cigarette.     Pulls a new one from a damp little box. \nJACK An' Billy. Well, Billy's a writer and a fisherman. Me, I'm just a fisherman. \nOffers the box.     Quoyle shakes him off. \nJACK Fishin' and the sea is all I am. My pap the same. My boy. \nQUOYLE So he said. Waitin' for his license. \nAh. Jack's smile doesn't actually fade.       But the eyes flicker, and Quoyle is sorry he opened his yap. \nJACK Naw, my boy's passed. Went to sea and there he rests. Bless his bones. \nHis glance goes to a photo. Jack and a strapping blond son. Not Dennis, that's for sure. Somehow, we are suddenly down to business... \nJACK Want two things from ya, Quoyle. First. You cover every local car wreck, take pictures. Front-page photo every week, whether we have a wreck or not, an' we always do. When we don't, we dip into Card's file, he's got some beauties. \nINTERCUT...half a red Geo being fished out of the water. Petal's lifeless torso hanging backwards out the door, arms gracefully extended like a ballerina or Olympic diver. Over this... \nJACK (O.S.) Knack to this. If there's a dark patch on the ground, it reads blood, whether it's motor oil or Diet Coke. Gloves, hat, lyin' in the road... \nBACK to Jack.     Canny and keen.   He knows this stuff. \nJACK ...somethin' that humanizes, makes ya feel. That's what a wreck is. It's always saying, 'There but for the grace of God...' \nDo ya follow?     Quoyle follows. \nJACK Plus. We're starting a feature on the shipping news. What ships come in, what goes out. Whatever's of interest. Throwin' it to you, son. Chance to shine. \nA beat. \nQUOYLE Mr. Buggit. I'm not.     Well, a water person. \nAh.   Jack takes this in.     The smile returns. \nJACK Chance.    To shine. \nIf you catch my drift.      Quoyle shuts up. \nJACK One peculiarity. I'm no joke, son, and I don't tolerate jokes about Newfies. Or them that does. \nSMASH CUT to... \nINT. SKIPPER WILL'S DINER - NIGHT \nCLOSE on Dennis, holding a half-eaten squidburger in two hands. Oblivious to sawdust, smoke and stench, he is charmingly, engagingly, smashed. \nDENNIS So this Newfie comes to Toronto. Cabbie says, take ya to meet girls for a good time. Boy says, okay, but I only want a Newfie girl. \nHis audience is Quoyle and Nutbeem. Each holds a squidburger of his own, tentacles dangling. Quoyle has his next one handy by his beer. \nDENNIS Right section of the party district, he finds a girl, they have sex, she says that's a hunnerd dollars. He says fine, tips her another hunnerd! She says, wow, can y'come back t'morrow? \nQuoyle takes a humongus BITE.      Tentacles now dripping from his jaws. Rapt. Hypnotized. \nDENNIS Next two nights, same thing! \nFinally she says, I never met so sweet a guy, where ya from? He says, Misky Bay, Newfoundland. She says, really? Me, too! \nQuoyle hanging on the punch. \nDENNIS He says, I know. Yer ma asked me t'give ya six hunnerd dollars! \nQuoyle SNORTS his laughter, dislodging a tentacled morsel or two. Nutbeem has to look away, as Quoyle retrieves the chunks, stuffs 'em back in his mouth. \nDENNIS Yer the model Newfie, Q, but fer th'boat. Why doncha buy Nutbeem's? \n", "test2_id": 1723, "test3_input": "BILLY Every time I wonder.     Is this the last coat? \nPries the lid off the tin of black.     And when he sees Quoyle's eyes... \nBILLY Well, there's no one else to do it, y'see. \nQUOYLE (straight back) There is now. \nAn easy smile.   Stating the obvious. \nQUOYLE \nThere's me. \nThe old man's face just stops.     The eyes sharpen.   Into a question. \nQUOYLE Well, you said. There's no one else. \nAs if that were enough. \nQUOYLE Hey. If you wanna rest next to him. I'll paint yours at the same time. No extra trouble. \nBilly stares at him.     Stares at him.   Clears his throat, gruffly. \nBILLY Then better get Alvin Yark. T'build yer a real boat. So yer'll be around. \nEXT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY \nQuoyle exits the house, pulling on his jacket, and... \n...stops. Something laid across his threshold. A long piece of TWINE has been placed there. KNOTS tied evenly along its length. He glances back up to the second floor, thinking Bunny. Looks at the thing again. Neat work. Odd. Slips it in his pocket. \nEXT. CLIFFSIDE - DAY \nQuoyle now making his way down a steep primitive trail through lush vegetation. The green house is far above him. The shimmering bay now just below. This way down as treacherous as it is wondrous, and Quoyle SLIPS in the tangle and wet, half-slides through wild angelica stalks and patches of dogberry, suddenly... \n...LOSING his balance, TUMBLING roughly down a stretch, rolling, grasping a spruce trunk. Pulling himself to his feet, he hears... RUSTLING. Looks up, just as... \n...a WHITE DOG appears through the bushes. Red eyes. Lips curled back. A frozen second of mutual indecision, and Quoyle... \n...SCREAMS and falls on his butt.     The dog... \n...TAKES OFF, bounding down a path we hadn't noticed. Toward an upright SILHOUETTE. Who steps into sun just long enough to become... \n...a MAN, grizzled and scrawny and quick.      Gone in a flash.   Like a skinny ghost. And there, on his butt... \n...Quoyle laughs softly.     How 'bout that?   Murmurs... \nQUOYLE Attaway, girl. You're smarter'n all of us. \nAs he climbs to his feet, he sees the rocky beach just below. Squints, as if at something that doesn't belong. We see it now... \n...a SUITCASE, washed up onto a tangle of rocks, just offshore. \nANGLE...Quoyle wading into the water. Up to his knees, slips, sinks to his waist. Stays upright. Snatches the suitcase from its perch. Brings it back to shore, holding it high. Already, he is making the face of someone smelling something he'd rather not. \nHe sets it down. The face is worse.     His curiosity running the show, he unhooks the latch... \n...and stops. Because he's staring inside. Suddenly, he SCREAMS and FLAILS back, his leg STRIKING the case, and out tumbles onto the wet ground... \n...the head.   Of Bayonet Melville. \nINT. SKIPPER WILL'S DINER - NIGHT \nThree guys. Three beers. Five squidburgers (Quoyle likes his backups ready and waiting). \nCARD Y'know none a that impresses Jack Buggit. He's not one fer blatant ambition. \nQuoyle thinks better of his answer.    Chomps a bite instead. \nNUTBEEM Even if you don't recognize 'Human Head Packed in Satchel' as the most compelling piece ever to appear in... \nCARD (snorts) Even if. \n...takes his hand from his greasy burger.    Scratches his crotch below the table. \nNUTBEEM A triple increase in ad revenue. Does get. The man's attention. \nAnd winks at the silent hero. \nCARD Weren't even double if yer figger it right. (to Quoyle) Point is. A real reporter woulda \nnamed the obvious suspect. \nQUOYLE More obvious. Than the wife? \nCARD Yer aunt, ya thick Statie lardface dumbass! \nQuoyle.   And Nutbeem.   Just look at each other. \nCARD She gets stiffed by the guy, after basin' her new shop on that revenue. And she ain't one ta fool with. Capable a anything, that woman! \nQUOYLE (angry now) Okay, where's the wife? Agnis kill her too? \nCARD Okay, where's this week's shipping news? Or you gonna rest on yer Crisco-coated laurels. \nQuoyle viciously BITES into his squidburger. \nCARD Uh-oh. The way he's chewin', he ain't a fat boy t'be trifled with! \nNUTBEEM (quietly) His piece.     Is about oil tankers. \nCard blinks.   Looks at Quoyle with, dare we say, new respect. \nCARD Hope fer ya yet. Now that's news, the McGonigle oil field. Petrodollars, a golden flood a jobs. That's th'future a this god-forsaken ice rock. Civilization! \n", "test3_true": "CARD That's why those with half a brain already put our money where our mouths is! \nPuts his squidburger.    Where his mouth is.    Nutbeem clarifies for Quoyle... \nNUTBEEM Two shares. Of Mobil. \nINT. WAVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nANGLE...brightly lit kitchen. Bunny sits at the little table, a large mixing bowl filled with popcorn before her, little Herry at her side. They are watching Freakazoid on a tiny TV. Bunny shovels in a mouthful of popcorn. Then makes a sage, if unintelligible, comment about the show to Herry. Still chewing, she takes another huge handful of popcorn... \n...Herry opens his mouth like a baby bird. Bunny stuffs the snack in. It's a stare-and-chew, side by side. Just alike. \nANGLE...cozy parlor. Quoyle sits in a Barca-lounger with a huge bowl of chips in his lap. He is watching hockey on a modest TV, the action is fierce. Stuffs his mouth full of chips, yet somehow manages to say... \nQUOYLE ...so there they were, this goofy old codger and his dog, big as life. \nPULL BACK to see Wavey now. Curled on the sofa, under a lap robe. She is knitting something in a heavy oxblood-colored wool. He watches her work. \nWAVEY (softly) That'd be old Nolan. He's actually your uncle, last of the crazy Quoyles. I should have realized. \nKeeps her eyes on her work. \nWAVEY Sad, really. Lives like a hermit in a run-down shack. No one to look after h... \nQUOYLE Here I was worried about Bunny night and day, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with her. \nA silence.   Which makes him uneasy. \nQUOYLE Her only problem is her dad worries too mu... \nWAVEY (not looking up) You are a loving and wonderful father. You're not the problem. \nShe meant to reassure him.    Instead... \nQUOYLE So what is th... \nWAVEY Nice to see you. \nLooks up with smoky eyes. \nWAVEY ...after all this time. \nOh. \nQUOYLE Well. I've been workin' longer hours. So Dennis and Beety were kind enough to bring Bunny to the daycare. Fed her a lotta meals, too. They're real friends. \nQuoyle's smile tries to sell the innocence of his absence. \nWAVEY (very quiet) I thought you forgot. That I'm your friend, too. \nNo smile from her. She wants him to know she was hurt.           He shakes his head, serious now. No, I didn't forget. \nWAVEY You want another sandwich?    There's roast pork. \nHe holds up what's left of his four-decker.          This is plenty.   Takes a huge bite to show how much he likes it. \nWAVEY You said.    You'd read me your article. \nHe did, he nods.     But just now he's scared to. And so she smiles. Which traps him.     He pulls out a single sheet of paper. Clears his throat. \nQUOYLE Nobody Hangs a Picture of an Oil Tanker. That's the header. \nShe nods. Likes that. He gestures, go back to your knitting.             So she smiles, slyly. And commences to knit. \nQUOYLE (reads) There's a 1904 photo hung in the library. Eight schooners heading out to fishing grounds, sails spread it like white wings. Beautiful. Beyond compare. \nThis means something to him.       Hear it in his voice. \nQUOYLE (reads) More common today is the low black profile of oil tankers. Like the ruptured Golden Goose, which last week bled 14,000 tons of crude onto seabirds, fish and boats at Cape Despond. \nHe stops.    As if revisiting that little thought in his mind. \nQUOYLE (reads) There will be more and more tankers. They will grow old and corroded, and their tanks will split. They have already done to fishing. What their spill has done to fish. \nHe sneaks a glance.       She has never looked up. \nQUOYLE (reads) Nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker. On their wall. \nSilence.

I think he'll never stop until you're fired. \nQuoyle keeps nodding at each point.          Yep.   Yep. \nWAVEY I think I haven't been so proud. Of a friend.

There's roast pork. \nHe swallows.    He just doesn't want to cry from happiness. \nQUOYLE Well, sure. \nINT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY \nCLOSE on Card. Who is RIPPING the single page in half. Then again. And again. And again. See Quoyle now, standing at the desk like a statue. Billy and Nutbeem at their stations, watching as Card... \n...flutters the pieces down onto his desk.

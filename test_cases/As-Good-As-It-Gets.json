APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT \nANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the unseen love of her long life. \nSWEET-FACED WOMAN I'm just going to get some flowers, dear. I'll be back in twenty minutes. It's tulip season today. I'm so happy. \nAnd now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated. \nPOV - MELVIN UDALL \nin the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved, unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator door he holds open. \nMELVIN Come here, sweetheart... come on. \nON DOG \nSniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the mutt who has ignores him. \nMELVIN Wanna go for a ride? Okay, sweetie? \nThe dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK. \nMELVIN (a malevolent tone) You've pissed your last floor, you dog-eared monkey. \nThe dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the garbage chute. MELVIN I'll bet you wish you were some sort of real dog now, huh? Don't worry...  this is New York. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere, you know? You ugly, smelly fuck. \nAnd with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING \"ANOOOOS\" from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT \nFrantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about to enter his apartment. \nSIMON Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie... \nHe notices Melvin at the far end of the hall. SIMON Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there! (as Melvin turns) Have you seen Verdell? \nMELVIN What's he look like? \nMelvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is directly opposite Simon's. \nSIMON My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like? \nMELVIN I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall. \nSimon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend. \nSIMON Which color was that? \nMELVIN Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food... \nSimon has had it. \nSIMON Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall. \n", "test1_true": "SIMON Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that. \nFRANK (overlapping) Simon, you've got to get dressed. \nMELVIN (to Simon) What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now? \nSIMON (to Frank) Do you still think I was exaggerating? \nFRANK can only smile. \nFRANK Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch. \nMELVIN Hope you find him. I love that dog. \nSimon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin. \nSIMON (directly) You don't love anything, Mr. Udall. \nSimon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the hallway. \nMELVIN I love throwing your dog down the garbage chute. \nINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT \nMelvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens the medicine chest. \nINT. MEDICINE CHEST \nScores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the process two more times. \nINT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT \nA group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN holding Verdell who looks and finds: \nSIMON \nwho looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves quickly toward the group and his dog. \nSIMON Thank the good Lord... wow... my honey... where have you been? \nPARTY GOER (thinking the greeting's for him) He always liked me. \nAs Simon goes past him to take the dog from the Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside. Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS in protest. \nSIMON Just for a second, okay? \nThe DOG YAPS \"no.\" Simon, delighted, picks him up again. \nSIMON (kissing him on the mouth) Look at him...  where was little baby? \nHANDYMAN (smiling) In the basement garbage bin eating diaper shit. \nSimon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in cheek, trying to suppress his amusement. \nSIMON Go ahead, John, you earned your fun. (looking at Verdell) How did he get down in the basement? I mean even if he got on the elevator how... ? \nHANDYMAN Maybe some nice neighbor shoved him down the garbage chute. \nSIMON My God! No! \nHe stares out... Frank frustrated following. \nINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT \nQuiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he writes. \nMELVIN 'Somewhat in the dark, she had confessed and he had forgiven. This is what you live for, he said. Two heads on a pillow where there is only the safety of being with each other. How, she wondered, could she find such hope in the most shameful part of her.' \nHe barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads. \n", "test1_id": 240, "test2_input": "INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nMelvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning periodically to keep an eye of his dog. \nCAROL So what are you doing with a dog? \nMELVIN Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around. \nCAROL You're not worried that someone might take him? \nMELVIN Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake. \nCAROL Sorry. \nMELVIN It's okay -- I'll sit here. \nHe changes tables for the first time ever so that he can keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed. \nCAROL You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in. \nMELVIN How old are you? \nCAROL Oh, please... \nMELVIN If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty. \nCarol looks at him. \nCAROL And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you? \nMELVIN (quickly) Otherwise, you're not ugly. \nCAROL (laughs out loud) Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast. \nMELVIN What's with the dark? \nHe indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own. \nCAROL Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol. My son had a full blown attack. And this time, for extra fun, they gave us the wrong antibiotics, so I get him home... \nShe reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes nuts. \nMELVIN No...  no...  leave it...  the bacon's for the dog. \nShe is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty. \nMELVIN Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke... \nCAROL You all set here? \nMelvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY \nAs Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk. \nMELVIN It's a beautiful day for our walk. \nMelvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior. \nON VERDELL \nagain carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level. \nMELVIN Don't be like me, don't you be like me. You stay just the way you are because you are a perfect man. I'm gonna take you home and get you something to eat...  what you love. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nFEMALE PASSERSBY (charmed) Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like that. \nMELVIN (all smiles to Verdell) Let's go home and do some writing. \n", "test2_true": "Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself with great satisfaction as he goes. \nVerdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing aloud to the dog. \nMELVIN \"He turned off the gas jets and carried her outside. He kissed her brow and when her eyes opened and found him, he said, 'there are easier ways to break a date.' She laughed. The only sensible ambition he had ever known was now realized. He had made the girl happy. And what a girl. 'You've saved my life,' she said, 'you'd better make it up to me.'\" \nExhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine... \nMELVIN (singing to Verdell) Done! (playing with him some) Yes, I hate the doggy...  yes, I hate the doggy. \nHe exits. \nMELVIN (V.O.) Sixty-two books... done! \nAs the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our couple's play time for... \nINT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY \nAs the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and talk of how long Nora can stay on. \nINT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY \nFrank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it. \nFRANK How's Verdell doing? \nMELVIN He's a pain in the ass. \nAs he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's surprise. \nFRANK Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust... \nMELVIN (leaping at the chance) It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me. \nFRANK No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow. \nMELVIN (too loudly, weirdly) Okay by me. \nFrank exits. \nINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMelvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to the door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are locked...  checks again to make sure he turned them in the correct direction...  turns from the door...  then back to check once more. And again...  and again...  anguished, until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on. \nINT. NEW YORK BUILDING - MELVIN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY \nMelvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a wheelchair and shudders... \nMELVIN That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like... \nSIMON (interrupting) Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall? \nA beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply. \nSIMON Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart? (to Melvin) By the way, thanks for saving me. \nMELVIN I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing. \nSIMON (not listening) Verdell? \nON VERDELL \nTotally weirded out...  hiding behind Melvin...  now Melvin shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other...  Simon smiles at the dog...  he is emotionally caught up in the reunion. \nSIMON Hi, sweetheart. \nVerdell isn't eager. \nON SIMON \n", "test2_id": 241, "test3_input": "CAROL (great, forceful hand gestures) ... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married. (this next one's tough) Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any. (weeps at her insight) Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts? \nBEVERLY Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr... \nCAROL Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose. (puffy; red; furious) What is it, Mom? No kidding. \nSlumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked husky voiced question. \nCAROL What is it you want? What? \nBEVERLY I want us to go out. \nA beat, then. \nCAROL (simply) Okay. \nINT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAs they enter, still wiping away the effects of their cry. \nCAROL (to Sean) We're going out. \nSEAN (looking at their red eyes) Looks like fun. \nShe kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting. \nCAROL Okay -- we're out of here. I love you. \nSpencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading. Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself, going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then to her son to ask: \nCAROL Do you love me? \nSPENCER Uh-huh. \nCarol exits. \nEXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY \nBeverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A simple and unprecedented experience in their recent lives. \nBEVERLY Nice to get out, isn't it? \nCarol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar. \nINT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY \nAs Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her 14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages. \nCAROL Don't get it wet. \nLisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol. \nCAROL So it's okay? \nLISA You almost have me liking him. You sure come from the heart. I never knew what you went through with everything. \nCAROL I wanted him to know how much he'd done. (looking over) Can you believe he's eating with someone. \nON MELVIN & FRANK \nMELVIN It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off. \nFRANK Sure -- take him to the vet. \nMELVIN I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days. \nFRANK Do it. \nCAROL Melvin. \nShe self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope. \n", "test3_true": "CAROL (sotto) A thank-you note for what you did for me. \nHe hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and walks back to the service area where, embarrassed, confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note. \nAfter Carol leaves... \nFRANK She's nice. \nMELVIN (to Frank) Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.' \nFRANK It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note. \nMelvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing message. \nFRANK What? \nMELVIN \"What?\" Look at you... You sense a mark. \nFRANK Hey -- you called me... I... \nMELVIN About a dog. \nFRANK Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon. \nMELVIN Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here. \nFRANK It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone. \nMELVIN Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good. \nFRANK Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him? \nMELVIN Think white and get serious. \nCarol enters scene. \nFRANK Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive? \nMELVIN (loudly) Like the wind but I'm not doing it. \nCAROL Getting loud, getting loud. \nMELVIN He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore. \nCAROL I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city. \nShe exits. Frank prepares to depart. \nMELVIN Okay. I'll take him. Get him packed -- ready -- tomorrow morning. \nFrank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes. \nMELVIN (excited) Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much. \nFRANK If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know. \nMELVIN Last word freak. \nFrank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a \"good-bye\" to him. \nCAROL So. Anything else? \nMELVIN Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore. \nCAROL Okay. \nMELVIN Hey, what I did for you is working out? \nCAROL (a breath; then) What you did changed my life. \n", "test3_id": 242}

{"train": "AS GOOD AS IT GETSAS GOOD AS IT GETS \nAS GOOD AS IT GETSAS GOOD AS IT GETS \nby \nMard Andrus \nAnd \nJames L. Brooks \nStory by \nMark Andrus \nFADE IN: \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT \nANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the unseen love of her long life. \nSWEET-FACED WOMAN I'm just going to get some flowers, dear. I'll be back in twenty minutes. It's tulip season today. I'm so happy. \nAnd now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated. \nPOV - MELVIN UDALL \nin the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved, unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator door he holds open. \nMELVIN Come here, sweetheart... come on. \nON DOG \nSniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the mutt who has ignores him. \nMELVIN Wanna go for a ride? Okay, sweetie? \nThe dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK. \nMELVIN (a malevolent tone) You've pissed your last floor, you dog-eared monkey. \nThe dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the garbage chute. MELVIN I'll bet you wish you were some sort of real dog now, huh? Don't worry...  this is New York. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere, you know? You ugly, smelly fuck. \nAnd with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING \"ANOOOOS\" from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT \nFrantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about to enter his apartment. \nSIMON Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie... \nHe notices Melvin at the far end of the hall. SIMON Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there! (as Melvin turns) Have you seen Verdell? \nMELVIN What's he look like? \nMelvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is directly opposite Simon's. \nSIMON My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like? \nMELVIN I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall. \nSimon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend. \nSIMON Which color was that? \nMELVIN Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food... \nSimon has had it. \nSIMON Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall. \nCAROL Or you can just wait your turn... \nMelvin walks back into the restaurant proper...  he hangs near their table...  his discomfort builds in this limbo... then: \nMELVIN How much more you got to eat? Your appetite isn't as big as your noses, is it? \nWOMAN What?!! \nMAN (to Woman) Let's go -- \nThe Woman starts to protest. \nMAN Let's leave. We're going. \nMelvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed. As he opens his utensils. \nCAROL Bryan says he doesn't care how long you've been coming you ever act like this again you're barred for life. I'm gonna miss the excitement, but I'll handle it. \nThere is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear the table. \nMELVIN The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee. \nCAROL You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that? \nMELVIN We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will. \nON CAROL \nStunned. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin senses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife. \nCAROL If you ever mention my son again, you will never be able to eat here again. Do you understand? Give me some sign you understand or leave now. Do you understand me... (adds truthful label) you crazy freak? Do you?!? \nA beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing down. \nCAROL Okay. I'll get your order. \nShe walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower lip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself. \nINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nShe is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make noises as she responds...  each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in. \nShe's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway -- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young Man stops and looks at her. \nYOUNG MAN What? \nCAROL I...  I...  I don't know...  You got me. \nHis eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited but doesn't know how to play it...  He pushes one of the fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her mouth...  She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt opening her mouth. She stops him. \nCAROL Let me just do whatever I do by myself...  I'll catch up to you someplace I promise. (as he's put off) Oh, no...  don't look like that. No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof. \nAnd so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about egg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when we hear from the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and COUGHING. \nCAROL Kissing...  kissing boys. Oh my. \nCarol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues. \nSPENCER (O.S.) (softly) Grandma, grandma... \nYOUNG MAN Maybe you better check. \nCAROL Like what did you think I was going to do? \nINT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nPulling herself together she goes off down the hallway... she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones... she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the cough. \nBEVERLY I'm sorry. I was hearing just everything you were doing so I put these on to give you privacy. \nCarol now goes into her son's room. \nCARL Maybe just you and me...  but this is for a painting. I need a pretty face. \nCarl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest. \nINT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThere is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer. He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent. \nSIMON Sorry, I was out in the studio doing some work and I forgot about our appointment. \nHe leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away -- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing the expensive apartment. \nSIMON I usually make such a big deal out of picking models but Carl's so thorough. I'll bet he drove you nuts checking your references. \nAnd he turns and sees the naked model. \nSIMON (taken aback) This isn't a nude. \nVincent moves back to retrieve his clothes. \nVINCENT Just kidding around. (then mutters) So much for love. \nINT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER) \nVincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly uneasy Simon. \nSIMON Exactly what is your previous experience? \nVINCENT How about that pose? (sing-song) This is not fun... (then) Give me some direction. \nVincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He tries not to show it. \nSIMON Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, \"hold that pose.\" Then just try and comfortably hold it. \nVINCENT (trying another space) The fact that you haven't said, \"hold it\" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right? \nSIMON No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity. \nVincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an intellectual tingle to be having this conversation. \nVINCENT I know exactly what you mean. \nThere's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity. \nSIMON Hold it. \nVincent does so -- hums a bit of \"Satisfaction\" to celebrate. \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nCarol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. Carol is rapt. \nAs they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so -- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary on her every action. \nMELVIN Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, \"Thank you.\" No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe. \nCAROL (reluctant forgiveness) Okay. \nMelvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an uncharacteristic rabbit punch. \nCAROL What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean? \nMELVIN I see the help -- judgement call. \nCAROL Just give yourself a little pep talk. \"Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out.\" \nMELVIN What's wrong with your son, anyway? \nCAROL What do you care? \nMelvin just looks at her. \nEVAN (to Vincent) What are you doing? Cruising him? \nAnd he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a club, as the brief savage attack begins. \nON VERDELL \nas he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in fear. The three attackers leave. Now silence. A single BARK from VERDELL. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK \nA mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him. \nRAY Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that? \nMELVIN How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole. \nRAY (stunned) What? \nMELVIN Just move on. No one here killed him. \nRAY Oh, is he dead? \nMELVIN Ask him. \nRAY We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT \nFrank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic little CRYING SOUNDS. \nAs we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell...  Frank is talking to the Sweet-Faced Woman. \nSWEET-FACED WOMAN I've been praying for him since I heard. \nFRANK So I've got to get to the hospital. If you could take the dog just for tonight. \nSWEET-FACED WOMAN Oh, Lord -- I've got all these antique knick-knacks...  Or else I'd be glad... \nFRANK Maybe if you kept locked in the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks. (as he turns away and she closes the door he adds) Old bitch...  Damn dog. \nA short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings... \nVERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches his mugger: \nFRANK You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say \"no\" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying \"no.\" \nMELVIN (quietly) I'm not saying nothing to you. \nFRANK Thanks for looking after him. \nFrank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and places Verdell inside. \nINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to block Verdell's escape. \nThe music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue continues O.S. \nMELVIN (O.S.) Hey, where are you going? You can't do this. (calls after Frank) I can't take a dog. (a confession) Nobody's ever been in here before. \nFRANK (O.S.) (threatening) You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow. \nINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMelvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now Melvin sees him. \nMELVIN You're dead!! \nVERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a bit calming. \nMELVIN I don't have dog food. And I won't want dog food here. You'll eat what we have. You'll eat what we eat. \nINT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nMelvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning periodically to keep an eye of his dog. \nCAROL So what are you doing with a dog? \nMELVIN Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around. \nCAROL You're not worried that someone might take him? \nMELVIN Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake. \nCAROL Sorry. \nMELVIN It's okay -- I'll sit here. \nHe changes tables for the first time ever so that he can keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed. \nCAROL You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in. \nMELVIN How old are you? \nCAROL Oh, please... \nMELVIN If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty. \nCarol looks at him. \nCAROL And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you? \nMELVIN (quickly) Otherwise, you're not ugly. \nCAROL (laughs out loud) Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast. \nMELVIN What's with the dark? \nHe indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own. \nCAROL Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol. My son had a full blown attack. And this time, for extra fun, they gave us the wrong antibiotics, so I get him home... \nShe reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes nuts. \nMELVIN No...  no...  leave it...  the bacon's for the dog. \nShe is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty. \nMELVIN Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke... \nCAROL You all set here? \nMelvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY \nAs Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk. \nMELVIN It's a beautiful day for our walk. \nMelvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior. \nON VERDELL \nagain carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level. \nMELVIN Don't be like me, don't you be like me. You stay just the way you are because you are a perfect man. I'm gonna take you home and get you something to eat...  what you love. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nFEMALE PASSERSBY (charmed) Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like that. \nMELVIN (all smiles to Verdell) Let's go home and do some writing. \nThe first gnawing pains of rejection. \nINT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY \nSimon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog up. \nSIMON No. Please, don't force him. \nJACKIE (to dog) You little stinker. He's given you everything. \nINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMELVIN'S POV \nVerdell's towel on the floor -- near his bowl. \nBACK TO SCENE \nMelvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and hits a few keys...  looks at Verdell's empty spot again... there are those who \"get the joke\" -- Melvin is clearly one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels the panic rise in him... \n...  all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates. \nMELVIN Over the dog...  an ugly dog. \nIt's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual sob is choked back...  he gets up -- following a definite pattern across the room. He is conducting a small but highest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared, beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door. \nEXT. NYC STREETS - DAY \nMelvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then turning into a building with a copper sign reading \"Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group.\" \nMELVIN Worst sidewalk in New York and look where they put in. \nINT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nMelvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word. \nMELVIN Help! \nDOCTOR If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment... \nMELVIN Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as \"obsessive compulsive disorder\" and then act like I have any choice in barging in. \nDOCTOR There's not going to be a debate. You must leave. \nThe Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to follow. \nMELVIN You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease? \nDOCTOR I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app -- \nMELVIN (suddenly) You changed the room around... \nDOCTOR Two years ago... \nMelvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough he must go through a careful exercise noting every new element before he's at all comfortable... as he studies each object. The Doctor is professionally intrigued despite himself. \nDOCTOR I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you... \nMELVIN Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here? \nDOCTOR Yes. (as Melvin starts for the office) No. \nINT. PSYCHIATRISTS' WAITING ROOM - DAY \nMore PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops. Eyes on them. Then: \nMELVIN (to other patients) What if this is as good as it gets? \nThey look stricken. He exits. \nINT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nMELVIN I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!! \nShe crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into the room. \nCAROL Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there. \nMELVIN (uncomfortably) How ya doing? \nSpencer just stares at him. \nMELVIN (miffed) You should answer when someone talks to you... \nCarol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then emphatically gestures him to \"clear out.\" Melvin backs out the door. \nCAROL Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin, and I can't handle you teaching my son manners. \nShe closes the door in his face, then walks to her son and leads him back to his room. \nINT. SPENCER'S ROOM \nCAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his ear. They both count down the seconds. \nCAROL AND SPENCER 5...  4...  3...  2...  1...  Bingo. \nSPENCER \nCAROL We are going to treat ourselves to a cab ride. \nEXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY \nAs Carol carries her young son through a class of uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She spots Melvin about to enter a cab. \nCAROL Melvin, wait! \nThe school kids pick up the chant in unison. \nSCHOOL KIDS Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait! \nHe turns to face them. \nMELVIN Shut up, kids! \nThey immediately obey as Carol approaches him. \nCAROL Melvin...  give us a lift. We've got to go see our friends at the hospital. \nMelvin is thrown...  he pauses a beat...  then holds the rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face. \nMELVIN I'll ride up front. Cover your mouth when you cough, kid. \nINT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY \nAs they settle in and drive off. \nCAROL Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, please and quickly please. \nEXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY \nAs Carol enters the hospital. \nCAROL (calling back) I owe you three dollars. \nMelvin follows behind her as she carries her son... \nMELVIN Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today? \nCAROL (furiously) No!!! Stay away from me! \nINT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY \nVerdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair... she has some index cards in her laps which she occasionally consults and shuffles. \nMELVIN (as he turns toward her) I think of a man and take away reason and accountability. \nThe fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close. \nEXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY \nA depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER. \nCAROL'S POV \nA car at the curb with \"MD\" license plate. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAs Carol breaks into a run. \nINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY \nAs she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment. \nCAROL Hello? Hello? \nVOICE (O.S.) Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here. \nThe worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk on opening day of the hunting season. \nINT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY \nCAROL What? Please? Now? Tell me?! \nDR. BETTES Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes. \nCAROL Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he? \nDR. BETTES He's in the bathroom...  He's fine. \nCAROL (overlapping) Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold. \nAnd so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now. Salvation as farce. \nSPENCER (to his mother) Hi... (they kiss) Did you know there are doctors who come to your house? \nCAROL No, I didn't. (to Bettes) So why are you h... \nBeverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient which, if life allowed, would be her natural state. \nBEVERLY I didn't know you had a secret admire. \nCAROL Huh? \nBEVERLY You met the gift. \nSPENCER He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors. \nCAROL (to Spencer) Stay out of this...  Doctor? \nDR. BETTES My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher. (as Carol reacts) She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do? \nCAROL I'm a waitress. \nON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace. \nBEVERLY In Manhattan. \nVOICE (O.S.) Dr. Bettes? \nDR. BETTES In here. \nA NURSE enters. \nNURSE Sorry it took so long. I don't know Brooklyn. \nSIMON What's wrong? \nNORA Who's going to walk Verdell? \nSimon hadn't thought of this either. \nSIMON No, no. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DAY \nNora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets. \nMELVIN Is he dead yet? \nNORA No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him? \nMELVIN Absolutely. \nNORA Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet? \nMELVIN Sure thing. \nNORA You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best. \nMELVIN Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City \"Sailor want to hump-hump bar\"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here. \nHe closes the door in her face. She stands there... thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then continues on her way. \nINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT \nThe doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing. \nCAROL There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact. \nBEVERLY Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help? \nCAROL It lets a crazy man into our lives. \nBEVERLY Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back. \nEXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nINT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY \nShades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair...  the PHONE RINGS. He goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he answers. \nSIMON Hello?...  yes...  sure...  finally, huh? Why, \"finally\"? Because I called you so many times. Maybe (relief) Oh, boy...  I was hoping it was something like that. You didn't get one of them, huh? 'Cause I mean it wasn't only your office -- it was your home, hotel and the cigar club you like in San Francisco. No -- Sarcastic...  Of course. I believe you. No, don't fire anyone...  Please. Maybe I'm wrong about the 20 times. Take a breath... (more) So, you miss me a little? Hey, strike the question -- How's the case going? Really. Fantastic. I didn't hear. I haven't been watching. Great. Just great. I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me? Well, I'm mending. No, I look fine. Well, some of the damage might still be noticeable if you look closely... \nHe runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and beaten face... \nSIMON Carl, I need some help and you're the logical one to turn to. (aghast) No! Not 'cause I blame you for what happened. I hardly get how you can ever think that. No, I'm not being sarcastic. (trying to figure it out) I guess because you hired the guy who did this you think...  No, I am a sarcastic person. Well, if you must know, the reason I said you were the logical person is because you always told me how you thought I was this great person who made you feel good about humanity and everything. You do remembering saying that? Well, whew. Okay, so Carl. I hate asking but this money thing is ridiculously serious... \nHe picks up an index card from his night stand and takes the leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance. \nSIMON \"Will you please loan me money? I will pay you back. I will give you whatever percentage of my income I don't absolutely need until I do. It will take a while. But I don't know what I'll do if you say\"... that. (as he listens) I understand...  yes...  No, I do. (a bit of boldness) But you know, you know -- you didn't even ask how much, Carl? Well, Frank has no right to discuss how much I'm in hock... no, you're right -- not the point. So...  what have you been up to??? Uh-huh... Oh, the group show... how was it? Well, I'm not surprised that there's that much talent around...  great...  Look -- gotta go...  no, you shouldn't feel that way at all...  take care, you, too...  you, too...  Good-bye. (as he hangs up) Pal o' mine. \nIt's very quiet. \nLONG SHOT - SIMON \nA lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional release -- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous with the moment of catharsis... \n...  but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering the room. \nMELVIN Maybe I'll bring him some food by. \nSIMON Thank you for walking him. \nSimon wheels away from Melvin. \nSIMON If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well. \nShe offers him the note. \nMELVIN No... no thank you notes. \nCAROL Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever. \nMELVIN Lovely. \nCAROL I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that. (reading from the letter, Melvin wildly uncomfortable) I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler... \nMelvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it -- emotionally moved by her own words. \nCAROL ... and I'm sorry for never spotting, right there at the table in the restaurant, the human being that had it in him to do this thing for us... You know what, I'm just going to start from the beginning... I have not been able to express my gratefulness to you... even as I look at the word \"grateful\" now it doesn't begin to tell you what I feel for you... \nAnd finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses. \nMELVIN Nice of you... thank you. \nCAROL Thank you. \nMELVIN Now I want you to do something for me. \nShe looks at him for a very strange, long beat. \nCAROL Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, \"what?\" I thought I said, \"what?\"... What? \nMELVIN I want you to go on this trip. \nCAROL No, sir... \nMELVIN I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook. \nCAROL The stiff one eye? \nMELVIN Two days. \nCAROL I can't. I work. \nMELVIN You take off when you have to. \nCAROL My son. \nMELVIN Bettes tells me he's doing fine. \nCAROL (no other way) Melvin, I'd rather not. \nMELVIN What's that got to do with it? \nCAROL Funny, I thought it was a strong point. \nMELVIN Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go. \nCAROL Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!? \nMELVIN Is there another way to see it? \nCAROL No. \nINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCarol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf of the closet. \nCAROL Well, here's a little suitcase shocked that it's been used. \nShe holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself. \nINSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER \nHer best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday \"girl Jockies.\" She fingers the good stuff -- puts it back -- then the everyday -- hesitates. \nCAROL (furiously exasperated) There's not way to pack for this trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm not packing the camera. \nOn opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners. \nVETERINARIAN Anything unusual in the dog's diet? \nMELVIN No. Everybody gets their own cage? \nVETERINARIAN Certainly. \nMELVIN (pointing to Chihuahua) Put him in with that one, not that one... (pointing to large dog) ... Builds his confidence. \nEXT. BUS STOP NEAR APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY \nCarol disembarks. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY \nAs she walks and turns a corner. \nCLOSE ON CAROL \nThe shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do not buckle. She does not whimper. No prison \"screws\" will have to support her weight. Still, the prospect couldn't be grimmer. \nCAROL'S POV \nMelvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open. \nCLOSER ON MELVIN \nHe is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the building. \nFRANK I'm sorry that I'm not taking you. \nSIMON (upset) So am I, Frank. \nFrank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace. \nMELVIN Soak it up -- it's your last chance at a hug for a few days. \nAs Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor changes... that quickly there is a shyness. \nCAROL Hi. \nMELVIN Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag. \nCAROL Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you? \nSIMON I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died. \nMELVIN Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up. \nCarol puts her bag in the car. \nMELVIN I was going to do that for you. \nCAROL (taken aback) It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit? \nMELVIN (totally non-plussed) I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything. \nCAROL (to Simon) Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage. \nSIMON That's very thoughtful. \nMELVIN Never a break. Never. \nCarol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small back seat. She struggles to get her feet in. \nMELVIN You're really jammed back there. \nHe reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his seat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel. She is startled by the gesture. \nCAROL Thanks, Melvin. \nSIMON Okay. Well, one day my father came in on one of those painting sessions when I was nine -- and he just started screaming at her -- at us -- at evil. And... \nMELVIN (very quickly) ... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano. \nCAROL Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on. \nSIMON I was trying to defend my mother and make peace, in the lamest way. I said, \"she's not naked -- it's art.\" And then he started hitting me. And he beat me unconscious. After that he talked to me less and less -- he knew before I left for college, my dad came into my room. He held out his hand. It was filled with money. A big wad of sweaty money. (gathers himself) And he said to me, \"I don't want you to ever come back.\" I grabbed him and I hugged him... He turns and walked out. \nCarol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice, understated, gesture of friendship. \nCAROL Well, you know -- I still stay what I said. You've got to get past it all when it comes to your parents. We all have these horror stories to get over. \nMelvin shifts INTO the FRAME. \nMELVIN That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good. \nCAROL No. \nSIMON Not it at all, really. \nMELVIN (a veteran's irony) Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY \nMELVIN Two bedrooms and the sofa opens... \nCarol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up. \nCAROL (to Simon) No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one? \nMELVIN Yes... sure. (to Simon) I'll take the sofa. \nCarol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials... \nCAROL (into phone) Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are you out of breath? You did?!? That is great... So great... So -- no, wait a second, Spence... \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nMelvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable. \nMELVIN Can I ask you a personal question? \nSimon laughs loudly in apprehension squared. \nMELVIN Do you ever get an erection for a woman? \nSIMON Melvin... \nMELVIN Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not... \nSIMON You consider your life easy. \nMELVIN I give you that one... (eyes suitcase) Nice packing. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCarol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new factors in her life. \nCAROL My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing. \nMELVIN Dancing? \nSIMON I can't, I'm exhausted. \nCarol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is visibly disturbed by her gesture. \nCAROL (to Simon) I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything? \nSIMON No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along. \nCAROL What a nice compliment. \nCAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so that passage for Melvin is impossible. \nSALESMAN Come on in. \nMELVIN No. \nSALESMAN No? \nMELVIN (pointing) That jacket and give me a tie. \nEXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nAs he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car. \nVALET #2 Good evening. \nMELVIN You have hard shells? \nVALET #2 I'm not sure. \nMELVIN Everyone else says you do. \nVALET #2 Then I guess we do. \nINT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT \nAs he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is having a martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool -- watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself... Turning down a MAN who wants to buy her another... And Melvin watches... Watches his date. \nHEAD WAITER Shall I get her for you? \nMELVIN No, it's all right. I'll just watch. \nHe enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns -- Melvin makes a \"Haul your ass over here\" gesture... and she smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her. She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables, giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g. She notices the waiter in her trail. \nCAROL (mouthing the words to Melvin) My drink is following me. \nMelvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite. He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily. \nCAROL You look s... \nShe stops herself from saying \"sexy,\" regathers, then... \nCAROL You look great. \nThey arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her. \nCAROL You wanna dance? \nMELVIN I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before. \nCAROL (rising) And? \nMELVIN No... (and before she can digest that) ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it. \nON CAROL \nMelvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave. \nMELVIN No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me. \nCAROL Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings. \nMELVIN (really pissed, mutters) That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails. \nCAROL That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never. \nMELVIN Okay. \nHe waves her down. \nCAROL (sitting) And mean it... \nCAROL (wiping away tears) I'll never forget you said it. \nMELVIN It was a mistake. \nBut she has already turned away and exits the restaurant... Melvin alone and miserable. \nINT. SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nHe finishes dialing. He is extremely tense -- not breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let the anxiety immobilize him... the NUMBER RINGS twice, then a humorless male voice: \nPARENTS' VOICE (humorless male voice) Hi. This is Fred Bishop... (perky woman's voice) ... and Betty. (Fred again) We are sorry to be unable to take your call right now. Please leave a message and we'd appreciate your including the time/date and purpose of your call. (Simon mouths the word \"date,\" then Betty speaks before the beep Bye-bye. \nSIMON Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in town... (he waits) ... and, folks, you haven't come home later than 10 in your lives. Please pick up -- really... Okay... I'm going to call again in the morning. I need to see you. Or, at least get you to answer the phone. \nHe hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he needs help. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - CAROL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nAs Carol enters with some energy. We FOLLOW her as she goes into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing things in. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSIMON Hello... Hello??? \nCarol thrusts open the door and enters... \nSIMON Was this supposed to be your room? \nCAROL Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door. \nSimon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, inadvertently venting some anger as she does so. \nSIMON Can you not be violent? \nCAROL I don't think so. You need help with the pants? \nSIMON (emphatically) No!!! \nCAROL I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal. \nSIMON Uh-huh... \nCAROL I'm sorry... are you okay? \nSIMON Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts. \nCAROL Why? What have you been thinking about? \nSIMON How to die, mostly. \nCAROL Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate. \nSimon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to prepare a bath. \nSIMON (turning off the light) Good night. \nCAROL Good night. \nWe are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom and we have... \nSIMON'S POV \nCarol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair -- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast exposed... \nBACK TO SCENE \nSIMON (a whisper) Hold it. \nHe leaves the bed. \nANGLES ON HOTEL DESK \nMelvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in her suitcase. \nMELVIN I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run... \nSIMON ... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye. \nHe hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over to Carol and Melvin. \nMELVIN ... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and... \nSIMON I'm going back with you. \nCAROL But what about... \nSIMON I'll take care of myself -- \nMELVIN What are you talking about? You got real problems. \nSIMON I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted. \nCAROL One night with me! \nSIMON You think you're kidding. \nMelvin stalks out. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe car parked near a phone booth -- \nMELVIN (to Frank over the phone) Aww Jesus! No choice. \nCarol walks up to Simon in the car. \nCAROL I got a gift for you. \nShe hands him a base ball cap. \nMELVIN (on phone) Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home. \nCAROL (to Simon) Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous! \nMELVIN Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there. \nMelvin hangs up the phone. \nMELVIN Good-bye. (to Simon) Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now. \nSIMON Another place where? \nMELVIN Does it matter? \nMelvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a special CD labelled \"For Emergency Use Only.\" As it PLAYS a confessional love SONGS: \nCAROL I don't want to hear that music right now. \nMELVIN What do you mean? You said you liked it. \nCAROL I don't. \nMELVIN This one has a special meaning. \nCAROL It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything. \nMelvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid- proclamation of love. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - NIGHT \nAs the car arrives... They get out... \nMELVIN Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home. \nMelvin breathes again. Simon enters the room. \nSIMON Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then... \nMELVIN Look, we both want the dog -- and... \nThe PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin doesn't move. \nSIMON Should I get it? \nMelvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several beats as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and: \nSIMON (O.S.) Hello. \nON SIMON \nSIMON (into phone) Hello. It's me. He took me in. Did you know? Hold on, I'll get him for you. \nHe walks back to Melvin's room. \nINT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nAs he enters. \nSIMON It's Carol. \nMelvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one mitt... he thrusts it at Simon. \nMELVIN Here. Take the dog. \nAs he speeds him out... \nSIMON Good luck. \nINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nAs Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat loudly. Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin -- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat clearing. \nMELVIN Hello. \nCAROL Yeah... Well... \nMELVIN (very concerned) How you doing? \nCAROL I can trust my brain. \nMELVIN That seems like a good choice. \nCAROL I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you. \nMELVIN The two might go together. \nCAROL See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now. \nMELVIN (what the hell) Cute. \nCAROL You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay? \nHe nods his head, \"yes.\" \nCAROL It's really something that you're looking after Simon. And what I said on the street. That was a bad thing to say. And it made me sick to my stomach. It was a bad thing to say. And I'd be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed your company... but the truth is you do bother me enormously and I know -- think -- that it's best for me to not have contact with you because you're just not ready and you're a pretty old guy to not be ready... and I'm too old to ignore that. But there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place. So thanks for the trips... \nShe's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not. \nMELVIN Okay to say something now? \nCAROL Go ahead. \nMELVIN I should've danced with you. \nCAROL Okay. Good-bye. \nShe hesitates -- \nINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT \nAs Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds. He bolts for the door and enters. \nINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nShe opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side. \nCAROL What do you want, Melvin? \nMELVIN Were you asleep? \nCAROL What do you want? \nMELVIN 'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy. \nCAROL Grouchy? \nMELVIN ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try. \nCAROL What job? \nMELVIN Were you asleep? \nCAROL What are you doing here? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nBeverly in the hallway looking on -- \nBACK TO SCENE \nMELVIN I'm sorry I woke you -- some other time. \nHe half turns to leave. \nCAROL I wasn't asleep!! \nMELVIN What a break... \nCAROL (losing it a bit) Is it a secret what you're doing here? \nMELVIN I had to see you... \nCAROL Because... \nMELVIN It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine. \nCarol has not ever heard anything like that before... it's sort of sexy in its sincerity. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her door down the hallway, has heard at least this last part... \nMelvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone... \nMELVIN (serious) Wait a minute, I'm overstating here, maybe the inside stairs. I don't want to sit with my feet in the gutter. What does that serve? It only... \nBut suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens. \nCAROL Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me... \nBEVERLY (butting in) Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit... (as Carol turns to her) Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt. \nShe disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh -- gathers herself. A beat. \nMELVIN (hopefully) Boyfriend? \nCAROL Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you. \n", "test1_input": "SIMON (O.S.) Mr. Udall. \nBut Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads. \nMELVIN 'At last she was able to define love. Love was... ' \nMore KNOCKING. \nSIMON (O.S.) Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please. \nMELVIN 'Love was... ' \nHe almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of love -- but the knocking throws him. \nMELVIN ... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed- stool-pusher. \nHe burst from his chair. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAs Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic. \nMELVIN (loud and angry) Yeeeess!!! \nSIMON Maybe this can wait. \nFrank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door. \nSIMON I found Verdell, Mr. Udall. \nMELVIN Well, that's a load off. \nMelvin walks back into the apartment and is about to close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery. \nSIMON Did you... do something to him? \nMELVIN Do you realize that I work at him? \nSIMON (eyes downcast) No, I didn't. \nMELVIN Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden? \nSIMON No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d... \nMELVIN Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart? \nSIMON Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making. \nMELVIN Okay, then. \nMelvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut. \nSIMON So the theory of confrontations is that now he'll think twice before messing with me? \nFrank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious. \nSIMON He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he? \nFRANK Won't worry about it. You go ahead. \nFrank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor. \nMELVIN (O.S.) Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really pissed!!! \nFrank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open. Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him forward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode. \nMELVIN No touch. No touch. No touch. \nFRANK You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me. \nMELVIN (calling) Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me! (to Frank) Assault and battery and you're black. \n", "test1_true": "He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears impressed. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nA crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. At times he places his palms together and extends his arms cutting a path through people. We will be very pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks. \nCLOSER ON MELVIN \nHis eyes focused on the terrain. \nINT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nANGLE ON WAITRESS \nCAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer. You would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be the most carefree time of the day. She is telling a story about her son for the umpteenth time. \nCAROL (to the Mother's little girl) Look at you, you're all better. \nMOTHER It's that new medication. \nCAROL You know all my son's stuff, right? \nThe Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but Carol interrupts her. \nCAROL No, no, no, I got a date tonight. I'm walking out the door this morning and he says to me, 'Mom, I promise not to get one of my fevers or coughs during your date.' \nMOTHER Isn't that sweet. \nCAROL Little blonde angle. (to child, affectionately) Eat everything. \nMelvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table. \nWOMAN It just came out of me. I said you love me the way a remote control loves a TV. As long as I switch every time... \nHER MALE COMPANION Wonderful. \nMELVIN People who talk in metaphors can shampoo my crotch. (on their look) Eat up. \nThey turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL, are talking. \nLISA Pay me back next week. \nCAROL I owe you. I told you today... them's the rules. Oh, excuse me, Melvin. \nShe puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness. \nMELVIN I'm starving. \nCAROL (firmly to Lisa) Will you please take it? \nMelvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out of the way... \nLISA This way you take a cab home so you have time to get ready for the date. \nCAROL \"Ready\" is not my problem. \nShe barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture. \nCAROL (to Melvin) Go sit down. You know you're not allowed back here...  Spencer's more excited about it than I am... He says, \"Mom, I promise not to get a fever or couch during your date.\" \nThe other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go \"awww.\" \nCAROL I know. He's just the best. \nMELVIN I've got Jews at my table. \nCAROL It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station. \nThe two waitresses signal their protests. \n", "test1_id": 240, "test2_input": "EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - TWO AM \nCarol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the subject. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEAR MELVIN'S BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN) \nHot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the rains come...  We are in a familiar neighborhood. \nANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE \nAs Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on it. \nINT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN) \nAs she enters building and realizes it's not just that she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet T-shirt contest...  the fabric clinging to her breasts, like the old movie poster of The Deep. \nINT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAs Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side of the door. \nCAROL Uh, Udall? \nMELVIN (O.S.) Carol the waitress? \nCAROL Yes. \nAs we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her breasts and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it self-conscious pats. \nCAROL The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour. \nMELVIN I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note? \nCAROL That's not why I'm here... (tearing suddenly) ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer... \nMELVIN (very uncomfortable) Note. Put it in the note. \nCAROL Why did yo do this for me? \nMELVIN To get you back at work so you can wait on me. \nCAROL But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because... \nShe pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long silence. Finally. \nMELVIN You waiting for me to say something? (as she shakes her head) What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow. \nCAROL I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up. \nMELVIN What needs clearing up? \nCAROL (strong and true) I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever. \nMelvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to scream -- \n-- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt during his half turn away from her -- and then answer hoarsely. \nMELVIN I'm sorry. We don't open for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m. \nCarol is amused, surprised...  maybe, in some small way ever taken by his style...  but top priority is clarity. \nCAROL I'm not kidding. \nMELVIN Okay!!!! Anything else?!? \nCAROL Just how grateful I am. \nHer mission completed -- she turns. \nMELVIN So you'll be at work? \nCAROL Yes. \n", "test2_true": "It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's night stand tell us...  He gets up -- the first time we've seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his body angles from the bed in a deliberate way. \nHe is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays very briefly...  Stops -- wipes some sweat from his forehead...  Walks to his computer room -- turns the light on and then quickly off...  Walks to his refrigerator... \nINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, INSIDE REFRIGERATOR - NIGHT \nAs he grabs a cardboard take-out box... \nINT. NEW YORK APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/SIMON'S APT. He knocks of Simon's door...  It opens quickly. \nSIMON'S APARTMENT \nMELVIN I took a chance you were up. \nSimon walks painfully back to a chair. \nMELVIN I brought you Chinese soup. \nSIMON Thanks. \nMELVIN I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here? \nSIMON Got any easier questions? \nMelvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him. \nMELVIN I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy. \nSIMON But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain. \nMELVIN (brightening) Yeah... \nHe feels a touch of community and not knowing where to take it from here. \nMELVIN I'm glad we did this. \nHe rises and makes an awkward exit. \nMELVIN Good talking to you. \nHe exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned. \nINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCarol seated working on a letter... She is trying to express her gratitude... An enormous sheaf of completed pages sit next to her... She is so involved she doesn't even look up as a young man, SEAN, knocks on the door and is let in by Beverly. \nThey exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly hear Spencer greeting him... We MOVE IN and read over Carol's shoulder -- \"I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how gratefull (sic)... \" \nBEVERLY You're not still writing that thank-you note? \nCAROL I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience? \nBEVERLY C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out. \nCAROL I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again? \nBEVERLY Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little... (struts and pumps her arms) You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist. \nCAROL (more emotionally than she intended) I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts. (looking at paper; weepy) This can't be right -- con- science. \nCarol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself on the brink of crying. \nBEVERLY Carol. What? \nCarol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able to stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission for Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol -- and then she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first. \nCAROL I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was... \nBEVERLY Go ahead. \n", "test2_id": 241, "test3_input": "CAROL (great, forceful hand gestures) ... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married. (this next one's tough) Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any. (weeps at her insight) Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts? \nBEVERLY Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr... \nCAROL Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose. (puffy; red; furious) What is it, Mom? No kidding. \nSlumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked husky voiced question. \nCAROL What is it you want? What? \nBEVERLY I want us to go out. \nA beat, then. \nCAROL (simply) Okay. \nINT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAs they enter, still wiping away the effects of their cry. \nCAROL (to Sean) We're going out. \nSEAN (looking at their red eyes) Looks like fun. \nShe kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting. \nCAROL Okay -- we're out of here. I love you. \nSpencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading. Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself, going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then to her son to ask: \nCAROL Do you love me? \nSPENCER Uh-huh. \nCarol exits. \nEXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY \nBeverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A simple and unprecedented experience in their recent lives. \nBEVERLY Nice to get out, isn't it? \nCarol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar. \nINT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY \nAs Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her 14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages. \nCAROL Don't get it wet. \nLisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol. \nCAROL So it's okay? \nLISA You almost have me liking him. You sure come from the heart. I never knew what you went through with everything. \nCAROL I wanted him to know how much he'd done. (looking over) Can you believe he's eating with someone. \nON MELVIN & FRANK \nMELVIN It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off. \nFRANK Sure -- take him to the vet. \nMELVIN I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days. \nFRANK Do it. \nCAROL Melvin. \nShe self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope. \n", "test3_true": "CAROL (sotto) A thank-you note for what you did for me. \nHe hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and walks back to the service area where, embarrassed, confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note. \nAfter Carol leaves... \nFRANK She's nice. \nMELVIN (to Frank) Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.' \nFRANK It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note. \nMelvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing message. \nFRANK What? \nMELVIN \"What?\" Look at you... You sense a mark. \nFRANK Hey -- you called me... I... \nMELVIN About a dog. \nFRANK Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon. \nMELVIN Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here. \nFRANK It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone. \nMELVIN Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good. \nFRANK Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him? \nMELVIN Think white and get serious. \nCarol enters scene. \nFRANK Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive? \nMELVIN (loudly) Like the wind but I'm not doing it. \nCAROL Getting loud, getting loud. \nMELVIN He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore. \nCAROL I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city. \nShe exits. Frank prepares to depart. \nMELVIN Okay. I'll take him. Get him packed -- ready -- tomorrow morning. \nFrank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes. \nMELVIN (excited) Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much. \nFRANK If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know. \nMELVIN Last word freak. \nFrank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a \"good-bye\" to him. \nCAROL So. Anything else? \nMELVIN Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore. \nCAROL Okay. \nMELVIN Hey, what I did for you is working out? \nCAROL (a breath; then) What you did changed my life. \n", "test3_id": 242}

INT STEVE'S BEDROOM NIGHT The door is ajar, people visible through it as Maggie dials a nu-rber on a bedside telephone. The phone rings on the other enc. And rings. And rings. Just as she's about to hang up, Tom answers. TOM (o.s.) (sounds angry) Hello? 
MAGGIE It's me. TOM (o.s.) (changes his tone) Oh, hi. How ya doin'? 
MAGGIE I'm okay. TOM (o.s.) How's your family? 
MAGGIE You know. Drunk. Fighting with each other. TOM (o.s.) Listen, Maggie, I'm sorry. I was an asshole. I should be there with you right now. 
MAGGIE Yeah, well, what can I say? You are kind of an asshole. How do you feel? TOM (o.s.) Fine. A lot better. Much, much better. Everything's fine here. Real good. 
MAGGIE Have you had any- TOM (o.s.) Nope. Not even one. 
MAGGIE No, uh... no more digging? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: TOM (o.s.) No. Uh uh. Back to normal. 
MAGGIE Look, I'm sorry too. I' wish I hadn't just stormed out of there, I shouldn't have left you alone. TOM (o.s.) I deserved it. 
MAGGIE Are you okay? You sound funny. What are you doing? TOM (o.s.) Just... moving a chair. There. 
MAGGIE Why don't you come up here with us? This time of night you could make it in an hour. TOM (o.s.) Well, I can't, really. 
MAGGIE Why not? TOM (o.s.) (a lame lie) I'm, uh, not supposed to use the truck for personal trips. 
MAGGIE (trying to keep her cool) Alright. I'll come down there and get you. I'll leave right now. Behind her, the bedroom door swings open. Jake stands there. He looks terrible. She doesn't hear him come in. TOM (o.s.) No, no, no, no, no, what do you want to do that for? Don't come down here. 
JAKE Feathers everywhere. Maggie turns back to Jake -- and GASPS. He's peeing his pants, the urine drizzling down over his shoes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MAGGIE (into phone) Oh, my God, I gotta go. I'll be there in an hour. TOM (o.s.) Maggie, wait, no, Mag- She hangs up the phone and races over to her son. 
MAGGIE Honey, what happened? Why didn't you tell me you had to go to the potty? Jake turns and looks at her. 
JAKE Help Daddy. 
CUT TO: 
INT TOM & MAGGIE'S DINING ROOM NIGHT Tom SLAMS down the phone. He's standing in the dining room, which is now so mud-spattered it looks like the inside of a cave. The table has been shoved against the wall, legs sticking out into the room. One corner is filled with a pile of broken-up chunks of rock. Tom strides across the room in two steps, lowers himself, and drops his legs through the open trap door. 
INT BASEMENT NIGHT Tom sails down into the basement and lands nimbly on the floor. Doesn't even use the ladder anymore. The rock is gone, broken apart by the jackhammer, and the hole is now eight feet long and as many wide, and about four feet deep. Tom leaps down into it and goes back to work. 
CUT TO: 
INT STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT In the front hall of the house, Maggie is putting on her coat. Jake sits on the steps, his coat on the carpet next to him. 
MAGGIE Jake, come on, we have to go. 
JAKE I'm staying here.

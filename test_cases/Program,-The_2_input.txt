The players all look at each other, then reluctantly get up and change tables. Darnell sits next to Joe. 
DARNELL (mock introduction) Hi there. Darnell Jefferson. I'm a young black man. 
JOE Hey, glad to meet ya. Joe Kane, Caucasian. So what doya think a that new Garth Brooks album? 
DARNELL I love that motherfucker. 
Coach Winters surveys the scene, sees that all the tables are integrated now. 
WINTERS That's more like it. 
He turns and walks on out. Immediately, the players begin to drift back to their old tables. 
INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 
Joe, Bud Lite and Bobby Collins, all suffering from various aches and pains are getting Naperson and analgesic balm out of the non-prescription drug cabinet. Joe pops a Nap and looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed CAMILLE SCHAEFFER works a knee lift. Camille's the perfect marriage of Southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation. Joe leaves the others, heads over, pokes his head in. 
JOE How ya' doin'? 
CAMILLE Fine. 
JOE Little late to be workin' out, isn't it? 
CAMILLE (with a little edge) Only time I could get in here when the football team wasn't usin' it. 
JOE (trying to get a rise out of her) Well, if it wasn't for the football team, might not be a weight room to use. You tryin' to firm up a little, or what? 
CAMILLE (unfazed) Don't need to firm up. I'm strengthening my knee. Had arthroscopic surgery. 
JOE Had my knee scoped once too. When you're finished here, maybe we could get a yogurt, compare scars. 
CAMILLE Sorry, I don't date football players. They're all full of themselves. I saw you on the cover of Sports Illustrated, so you're probably worse than most. 
JOE That's real open minded of you. So you won't consider doin' anything with me? 
CAMILLE No. 
JOE Well at least tell me what happened to your knee. What'd you do? Fall outa your convertible? 
Camille stops her knee lift, turns to Joe. We think she's going to fire on him. Wrong. 
CAMILLE You know, there's maybe one thing I'd do with you. 
JOE What's that? 
CAMILLE Tennis. I'll play tennis with you. 
Camille starts to walk away. 
JOE Tennis. You mean now? It's raining. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
CAMILLE - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT 
smashing a two-fisted forehand right at us, grunting with the exertion. Joe scrambles to get it back, but Camille's a world-class player. She attacks with a vengeance, blasting every shot ala Jimmy Connors, as Bud Lite and Bobby Collins watch, amazed. 
We begin a SERIES OF CUTS detailing Camille's relentless dismantling of Joe: Camille drilling a backhand down the line, Joe barely getting it back to the net. Camille hitting a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return. Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence. Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back. 
CAMILLE Thanks for the game, Heisman. You took it really well. 
And she walks away along to the net. Joe goes after her, pissed. 
JOE What's this Heisman crap? 
Camille's taken aback, not realizing she'd struck a nerve. 
JOE I didn't say anything about being a Heisman candidate. I don't go around strokin' myself about it. So what's this shit you're givin' me? 
CAMILLE I... I'm sorry... I just figured you were probably kissin' yourself in the mirror every morning. 
JOE You figured wrong. 
Now Joe walks away and Camille goes after him.

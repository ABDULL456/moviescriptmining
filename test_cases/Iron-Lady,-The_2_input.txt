INT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN. 
The HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the sound of Indian music - MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk. The electronic PEEP of the cash til. A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes her place second in the queue. The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat. 
MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER One forty-nine please. 
MARGARET How much is the milk? 
MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER Forty-nine pence. (taking the change) Thank you. MARGARET turns to leave, jostled by a tall young man wired into an ipod. 
EXT. STREET. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN. 
MARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in hand. 
INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. MARGARET sits at breakfast with her husband DENIS, sipping tea. DENIS butters his toast. MARGARET shakes her head. 
MARGARET Too much. Much too much butter. 
DENIS I like butter. MARGARET Milk's gone up. 
MARGARET reaches for a jug, pouring milk into it, sliding it down on a table. MARGARET (CONT'D) 49p a pint. DENIS Good grief! We'll have to economise. I suppose we could always sell the car. (chuckles) Or take in paying guests! He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door - DENIS (CONT'D) Watch out. She's on the prowl. MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a distant corridor, steady on the approach. MARGARET (to DENIS) Eat your egg. JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now sitting tapping open her egg. JUNE Goodness! There you are. JUNE's look of quiet concern. MARGARET Yes. MARGARET eats her egg. MARGARET (CONT'D) Here we are. But for JUNE, she is entirely alone. 
INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY. 
WHISPERING- 
JUNE I don't understand how it happened, how could she possibly have got out? It's very very important - 
MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER. 
JUNE (CONT'D) Please just make it really clear. Who's on after you? 
POLICE GUARD Dixon. 
MARGARET slips away. 
INT.HALL. CHESTER SQUARE. DAY. 
MARGARET hurries through the hall. 
INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY. 
A wide cupboard- 
MARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her, her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and grey twill. 
JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back, letting in the sunlight- 
JUNE Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a start. Carol's coming soon, I'll get some bags. Anything you want to go to Mark, I'll bring up a suitcase for it. 
The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed and grey twill- 
He reaches for a suit.

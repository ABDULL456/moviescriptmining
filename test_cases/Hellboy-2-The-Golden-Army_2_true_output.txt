The Princess leads the group through the surging, noisy crowd of bizarre creatures. Hellboy, Johann and Abe bring up the rear. 
PRINCESS No- not that way. Too risky- They're lost in unfamiliar alleys and byways. Until- 
JOHANN (finally, pointing) There. Stairs to the street... 
BUT- 
PRINCE Hold! The Prince appears at the top of the stairs, dressed in black. He's surrounded by his elite guard. Stepping to the rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd: 
PRINCE Hear me, o creatures of the forest! Can you recognize a traitor? She's here to betray her own! He casts a disdainful look at Hellboy. 
PRINCE I'm here to recruit all of you against the humans. Make your decision now. Those who join me will be rewarded. The rest... will be killed. A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the sound of CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is unclenching his fists and stretching his neck. He starts up the stairs, but a couple of the GUARDS leap down to block his path. 
HELLBOY I'm gonna put this as delicately as I can.

84 INT. BOWLING ALLEY - SAME 
A crowded BOWLING ALLEY is full of serious-looking players in colorful shirts and shoes. Someone rolls a ball down the center lane, and as it speeds right at the pins... 
BOWLER Look out, Manny! Strike city..! CRASH! Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting the clawing monsters right behind him! As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures pour out into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way free, only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK. Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the water, a fluid martial arts display. He ducks and parries the blows, leaping like Nureyev. Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at the Prince's guards. He manages to knock a couple off their feet. As they get back up, he uses the available bowling pins as clubs. The screaming PATRONS rush for the doors. 
85 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS 
Outside, the civilians flee, but the news crews come is back. He running. As their lights blaze up, REPORTER 2 gapes in disgust: Hellboy's massive hands are wrapped around the neck of a sweet little OLD LADY! He beats her mercilessly! 
OLD LADY Help me...! Please, somebody..! 
REPORTER 2 (to his cameraman) Oh, my God!! Oh, my- Roll! Roll on this! 
BELLBOY It's not what you think -! 
HELLBOY 2 54 
REPORTER (pointing at HB) He's lost his mind! He's worse than any of them..! CUT BACK to Hellboy, revealing that the old lady is actually 
WINK. Liz runs over with a prism from the SCHUFFTEIN GOGGLES and sticks it in front of the camera lens, revealing the truth. The reporter checks his monitor. 
REPORTER 
OH- 
86 STREET FIGHT 86 ALL the BPRD team, including Liz, is swept up in this fight. The denizens of the troll market overturn parked cars and knock down lamp posts, ROARING with excitement. 
LIZ 
(MUTTERING) The fire is not my enemy-- it is a part of me-- Liz yells out a warning... and then throws a barrage of flaming bolts. A pair of crab-like THINGS shrivel and burn. Johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster, until only his legs are visible beneath it. Bending at the waist - SPLAT - he brings it down on the head of the nearest creature! WINK and HB duke it out for a few beats and then HB finally vanquishes the Troll, Ripping his Iron Mace off and throwing it away. As the other monsters retreat... .the PRINCE appears: in his hand a complex mechanical GRENADE. Immediately worried, Abe hustles the Princess over to the BPRD truck. The Prince twists a timer. His bloodied trolls disperse, screaming, renewing the panic. 
PRINCE (to Hellboy) I will find you, young daemon - (to Nuala) - and you, too, my sister. Meanwhile, here's a taste of what lies in store. 
HELLBOY 2 55 He throws the grenade. Hellboy dives, just in time to catch it. He's about to throw it down a sewer, when he listens to its clockwork innards then: PING!!!! 
HELLBOY It's a dud, your royal assness - ! The Prince has disappeared, along with his horde. 
HELLBOY How do you like that? Just when I was loosening up. Then... CLACKK!!!. Hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it opens up like a beans. flower... and spews out a handful of Brightly colored 
ABE Pick them up!! 
HELLBOY Abe. relax- It's jumping beans... Abe is scrambling to retrieve them.

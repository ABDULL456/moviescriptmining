CUT TO: 
EXT.  LAS VEGAS BAR - CLOSING TIME 
The last customers find their way to the street, some with a little encouragement from a BOUNCER. 
Joyce steps out.  Nick comes up to her. 
NICK You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying. 
JOYCE Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice. 
Joyce takes off down the street.  Nick watches her for a beat. 
NICK I need your help, Joyce. 
JOYCE Where's Ich? 
NICK Unavailable. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 
On the stage, a young professional looking man is singing along to "SUMMERTIME" blasting from the stereo.  The Japanese way of letting it all hang out. 
We find Joyce and Nick at a corner table having a drink. 
JOYCE I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood. 
NICK I need someone to translate for me. 
JOYCE My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in. 
NICK It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night. 
JOYCE And I'm supposed to care? 
NICK You could fake it. 
Joyce finishes her drink, sets it down. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  STREET - NIGHT 
The neon flickers on the rain slicked pavement.  Nick and Joyce walk down the deserted street.  She's carrying an umbrella. 
JOYCE You're wrong to sell Ich short. 
NICK He drinks. 
JOYCE He's got a reason. 
Nick shrugs, everyone's got a reason. 
JOYCE His son hooked up with some bikers. Yakuza kids.  A cop shot him running from a robbery. 
Nick looks over for the first time. 
JOYCE A father doesn't out live that kind of thing here, much less a police officer... 
Pause. 
NICK Where's the wife? 
JOYCE You met her. 
Nick looks surprised. 
JOYCE The woman in the apartment.  She won't speak to him.  But she won't leave either.  Japan... Nice, huh? 
Before Nick can respond, something catches his eye:  What he sees -- 
A MAN 
partially shadowed, standing in the alley. 
Nick grabs his gun.  The man steps out zipping up his trousers.  It's a drunken Salaryman.  Nick lowers his gun. The Salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself. 
JOYCE Not wound too tight... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  JOYCE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
A three story modern building on a quiet street.  She's searching for her keys. 
JOYCE I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense. (as if to explain) I chant. 
NICK What do you chant? 
JOYCE 'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course. 
NICK Not if it works. (holding the door open for her) I'll meet you at the train?

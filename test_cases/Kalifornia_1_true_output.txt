EARLY They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers. 
Startled, Adele drops her shoulder bag. It lands on top of a couple of cardboard boxes and a beat up old duffle bag -- all their possessions. A few personal items spill out of it. 
ADELE Early Grayce! 
She kneels down to pick things up. 
ADELE (changes subject) Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold? 
EARLY Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now. 
EARLY'S POV 
As Adele picks up her spilled personal possessions, Early notices her prized cactus in the bag. 
EARLY What's this? 
He angrily reaches in and grabs it. 
ADELE Early! 
She reaches for the cactus but misses. 
EARLY What kind of a person would carry a cactus in her purse! 
Adele bites her lip almost crying. Suddenly, Early looks past Adele to see something, Adele turns too. 
NEW ANGLE 
The Lincoln comes gliding into view. 
INT. LINCOLN - PULLS INTO BUS STATION - DAWN 
Through the windshield we see Early... Adele by his side. 
CARRIE You've got to be kidding me, they look like Okies! 
Brian honks the horn, Early waves back. 
CARRIE Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around. 
BRIAN Lighten up... 
ON EARLY AND ADELE 
ADELE Geez, they look kinda weird. 
EARLY You just smile, let me do all the talking. 
ADELE How many times you gonna tell me that? 
EARLY (smiling at Brian) As many times as it takes. 
EXT. BUS STATION 
Brian stops the Lincoln and gets out. He approaches Early and shakes his hand, then Adele's. 
BRIAN Hi I'm Brian... Early, and you must be Adele. 
An awkward moment as everyone just stands there... until Brian reaches for Adele's bag. 
BRIAN Let me help you. 
Brian picks up her bag and carries it to the Lincoln. Adele is instantly won over by the gesture -- Early leery of it. 
INT. LINCOLN 
Carrie watches as Brian and Early carry their things to the trunk. Carrie leans forward and sets the trip odometer to zero. When she sits back up, Adele is standing at her window. 
ADELE Hi, I'm Adele. 
CARRIE (reserved) Carrie. 
She turns away from the window... 
ADELE (shyly) I like your hair. 
Carrie turns back, rolls down window... 
CARRIE ...Pardon? 
ADELE ...I said, I like your hair. 
CARRIE ...Thank you. 
She turns and sees Early reflected in the side mirror watching her. He grins at her, Carrie looks away. 
NEW ANGLE: FROM INSIDE THE TRUNK OF THE LINCOLN 
Brian crams the last of the bags in, as Early watches. 
BRIAN Tight fit. 
EARLY Best kind.

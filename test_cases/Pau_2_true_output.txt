(TO HIMSELF) Immense pressure and temperature drop. High winds, circulating in the troposphere, two opposed fronts clashing. Oh, this is going to be a good one. 
CLIVE 
A GOOD WHAT?! RUTH stares out of the window. 
RUTH Oh my God. 
EXT. SCRUB - EVENING 
A massive black funnel extends from the sky about half a mile ahead of the chase. It rakes the ground, reducing a small farm building to a million splinters. 
INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING 
MOSES BEHE 
HOLY- 
INT. ZOIL'S CAR - DAY 
ZOIL is sat mouth agape. 
ZOIL -Shit! 
INT. RV - EVENING 
CLIVE swerves to avoid a grain silo, which comes bouncing across the ground toward them. 
CLIVE Are you sure you know what you're doing?! 
PAUL Twenty seconds. 
TARA Paul, we'll get sucked right up. 
PAUL Stay on target. A branch smacks on the windshield, cracking it. 
CLIVE Paul! 
PAUL Stay on target. 
EXT. SCRUB - EVENING 
The grain silo bounces close to ZOIL's car, he swerves to avoid it and stops. MOSES pulls up just ahead. MOSES and ZOIL get out of the vehicles, almost unable to stand against the wind and debris. They watch the RV, now a good distance in front, heading for the heart of the tornado. 
ZOIL He's insane! 
MOSES BEHE 
RUTH! HAGGARD's car screams past. ZOIL grabs his radio. 
ZOIL Haggard, stand down. Stand down! 
HAGGARD (O.S.) He's mine. I can do this! 
ZOIL Haggard, it's suicide. 
EXT. SCRUB - EVENING 
CLIVE 
PAUL? 
PAUL 
NOW! The funnel suddenly evaporates into the sky, leaving the path ahead clear and oddly calm. 
GRAHAM It's gone! 
CLIVE Where did it go? 
EXT. SCRUB - EVENING 
ZOIL watches amazed. He almost smiles. 
ZOIL Son of a bitch! ZOIL looks at the sky. His face drops. 
ZOIL Haggard. Wait a minute! An engine revs nearby. ZOIL turns to see MOSES BEHE pull off in pursuit. 
ZOIL 
MR. BEHE! (into is radio) Damnit, hang back, hang back!

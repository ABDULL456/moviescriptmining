They walk in silence.  Corbett tightens the tarp against the cold air and looks at Eric. CORBETT (continuing) Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do! ERIC Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here. CORBETT (temper flaring) All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us? (sourly) I've seen plenty like you.  So -more- (CONTINUED) 134  CONTINUED:  (2) CORBETT (Cont'd) full of yourselves there's no room for other people's way of life. ERIC What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible. CORBETT I'm real sad you don't approve of me. 
He shoves Eric with his handcuffed hands. CORBETT (continuing) Tell me what I should do, Professor.  You got all the answers.  I shouldn't hunt? Fine, I'll just phone up and have a salad delivered. 
Livid, Eric backs away and knocks Corbett's hands away from him. ERIC Don't push me..! CORBETT Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you. 
Eric smashes his fist into Corbett's face.  Corbett reels back, more surprised than hurt.  Eric moves in, furiously throwing punches.  Corbett plows his clenched fists into Eric's midsection, doubling him over.  Gasping, Eric rams his head into Corbett and they fall into the snow. 
Despite the handcuffs, Corbett gets a few blows in.  They wrestle fiercely, and Eric ends up on top of Corbett.  He's about to throw another punch when Corbett looks up at him. CORBETT (continuing) First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind. (CONTINUED) 134  CONTINUED:  (3) 
Eric lowers his fist and climbs off of Corbett.  Corbett gets up and they continue on their way in sullen silence. 
135  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY 
Sunday morning.  Chimney smoke rises straight up in the still morning air and mingles with the wisps of fog hanging above the Devil's Cauldron valley. 
A scratchy RECORDING of a HYMN ("We Will Gather at the River") plays through a PA system, ECHOING forlornly off the hills.  The PEOPLE of Devil's Cauldron walk through the new snow to the center of the settlement.  Some, older Women mostly, head for the dance hall, where the HYMN originates. 
136  INT.  DANCE HALL 
The Women SING along with the HYMN.  They face a shelf holding the PA, a rusty TV and record player.  And, in front of the shelf, an unmanned pulpit. 
137  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON 
The Men, including Neff, split off from their mates and go into the Maqi. 
138  INT.  MAQI 
Neff joins some other Men sweating on benches in the primitive steam bath.   Kenai sits closest to the fire.  His thick glasses are steamed up, but he finally looks warm. NEFF Wilder's missing church services; you believe it? KENAI I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town. 
139  EXT.  FOOTHILLS ABOVE DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY 
Exhausted, Corbett and Eric climb across the last set of foothills before the Devil's Cauldron valley.  The town comes into view below them; faintly the MUSIC carries from below.  Corbett looks at Eric and breaks the silence: CORBETT What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us? (CONTINUED) 139  CONTINUED: ERIC They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow. CORBETT Don't bet on it. ERIC I already have. CORBETT You don't know how true that is. 
Eric sweeps the snow from between two rocks and sits down. ERIC We'll wait here until nightfall. No fire, no tarp. 
Corbett sits next to him.  After a long moment: CORBETT Didn't mean it, you being a coward.  You're a lot of things, 
but chickenshit isn't one of them. ERIC Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something. (beat) Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway. (beat) I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all. CORBETT Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more- (CONTINUED) 139  CONTINUED:  (2) CORBETT (Cont'd) I ever saw.  We're like Eskimos -- get too old to be useful, we're left on the ice to die. 
The men listen to the faint MUSIC echoing through the silent foothills. CORBETT (continuing; softly) My wife used to go to chapel on Sundays.  See her friends, 'cause I was away so much. (beat) Should've been home that day. She'd be getting dressed right about now... 
Eric glances over as a look of utter desolation crosses Corbett's face. 
140  EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAY 
The trappers file out the front door. VIKING BOB My guess is he's loose and heading for Chukfoktulik.  He'll need supplies; that's the closest settlement without a lawman. 
LeMalle carries his booty with him.  Viking Bob looks at him disapprovingly as he puts the big Remington rifle in the jeep. LEMALLE I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind. VIKING BOB (exasperated) What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game. LEMALLE Not in the right hands it ain't. 
To demonstrate, he rapid-fires several SHOTS from the hip, taking the radio antenna off the roof of the Turtle, shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession, and blasting the door latch off the utility compartment. (CONTINUED) 140  CONTINUED:

It's a big tacky shop: JACK'S 99 CENT STORE. 
INT. 99 CENT STORE - NIGHT 
`I'M TOO SEXY' BY RIGHT SAID FRED PLAYING LOUDLY ON SPEAKERS. 
The space is huge, garish and piled high with countless cheap household cleaners, candies, foodstuffs and toys. Arthur's fascinated, a tourist in austerity. 
ARTHUR Everything is 99 cents? 
NAOMI Yip. A whole penny less than those bourgeois assholes at the Dollar Store. 
Arthur reads a doll's label. 
ARTHUR `Warning: This product contains chromium, which may be linked to chronic bronchitis and reproductive hazards." 
NAOMI That one was on the news. Everyone else recalled them, the pussies. Not my 99 Cent! 
Arthur turns the doll over: a sticker reads `China'. 
ARTHUR Maybe China's trying to wipe out the west's children one by one. 
He gazes around in wonder. 
NAOMI Oh, I love this place. 
ARTHUR Why? 
NAOMI Well, I'd like you to believe it's because I'm a poor girl reduced to buying `Depressed Chef' burgers-in- a-can to Right Said Fred because I don't know where my next paycheck is coming from. But the truth is - bargains get me hot. Got it from ma. Drives my dad crazy. The tour? 
ARTHUR Yes please. 
She takes his arm. 
NAOMI Looking west, the ladies' hygiene products. Note that the more natural-sounding the name, e.g. this 'Vermont Breeze' Feminine Spray, the more lethal chemicals it contains. Watch out for the products cunningly labelled to make the dumber consumer think they're getting the real thing: 'Special J', 'Crampbell's Soup', ''Aunt Janina's' Maple-Style Syrup... 
Arthur holds a tin with a Coffee Mate-style logo, reading `Friend of Coffee'. 
The store music changes to RICKY MARTIN: `LIVIN' LA VIDA LOCA' 
NAOMI (CONT'D) And ah, the music: Dated sounds for lonely people to buy cheap shit to. 
They pass AN OLD WOMAN who is going through a stack of identical tins of cheap beans. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) I once watched a woman shoplift an 8-pack of toilet scrubbers down her panty hose to 'Everything I do, I do it for you'. 
Arthur just stares at Naomi. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Why are you staring at me? 
ARTHUR Just fascinated. 
NAOMI You're good at fascinated. 
ARTHUR You're good at fascinating. 
A CRASH. The old woman has knocked over all the beans. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Are you okay? Let me help you. 
He hands her a tin. 
OLD WOMAN Not that one. 
ARTHUR (offers her another) This one? 
OLD WOMAN (shaking the tin) No. There's less beans in it. 
ARTHUR This one? 
OLD WOMAN (sniffs the tin) No. 
ARTHUR This one? 
She stares and thinks. Arthur puts the tin to his ear. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) No. I think I hear a mouse inside. 
Arthur shakes and sniffs another tin. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Oh my G-d. This is a good one. No rodents. Packed.

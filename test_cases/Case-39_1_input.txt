- and to the shock of the other PARENTS waiting outside. Nancy comes after her in a fury. Runs her down. Erupts. 
NANCY Who do you think you are barging in there like that?! 
EMILY I don't want her in group anymore, I don't want her around the other kids. 
NANCY Well that's not your decision, is it?! 
Emily opens her mouth to reply, but Lucy beats her to the punch. 
LUCY It's okay, Nancy, Emily's been under a lot of stress lately, but she's really nice to me and I hope I can stay with her a really long time. 
Nancy, disarmed by the glowing praise, turns back to Emily. 
NANCY We'll talk about this later. 
Storms off. 
LUCY See you next week, Nancy. 
Nancy doesn't hear, busily reassuring parents, damage control. Emily and Lucy arrive at the elevator. Emily hits the button. 
EMILY You're never going back there. 
LUCY Why, Emily? 
Emily says nothing. Lucy keeps asking the same question, in the exact same intonation, as Emily ignores her: 
LUCY Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily? 
DING. The doors open. 
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
Emily and Lucy step in. The door closes. Lucy continuing her verbal assault as they start to descend: 
LUCY Why, Emily? Why, Emily? 
Suddenly the ELEVATOR LURCHES TO A VIOLENT STOP. It buckles Emily's knees. She is terrified, practically hyperventilating. 
EMILY W-w-what's happening - ?! 
Lucy has gotten her attention. 
LUCY Can I go back to group next week? 
EMILY You're never going back there! 
Lucy looks at her as one regards a small dumb animal. Then looks up at the ceiling. 
LUCY Are you sure? 
Horror as Emily realizes what she's thinking. We hear the first CABLE SNAP above them. In the CREAKING HUSH that FOLLOWS: 
EMILY No... 
The second CABLE SNAPS. The elevator goes into a HELLISH FREE FALL. 
The acceleration is dizzying. 
Emily clutches the rail with both hands, SCREAMING as the elevator goes cannonballing down the shaft. Lucy indifferent as they plummet toward certain death. 
The floor indicator light races toward L, the car shuddering violently, the noise deafening. It's a horrible way to die. 
Emily closes her eyes in anticipation of impact. And in the sudden BLACKNESS there's no noise at all. Just a soft, DISTINCT 
DING. 
A breathless pause then Emily opens her eyes. And sees the elevator is no longer falling. Never was. The doors glide open to the first floor lobby. 
Lucy gives her a quiet look and strolls out. A businessman steps into the elevator, watching bewildered as Emily releases her white-knuckled grip on the railing and staggers out, so badly shaken she can barely stand... 
INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Fish swim languidly in the tank. It's after midnight. We're looking down the darkened hall at Emily's closed bedroom door. 
INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Emily, in a coat and shoes, packing a suitcase. Snaps it quietly shut. Looks over at the barricaded door. Draws a tense breath. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
From down the hall we hear the DEADBOLTS SLIDE QUIETLY OPEN. 
The door opens a crack. 
EMILY'S TERRIFIED FACE peers out. Making sure the hall is empty.

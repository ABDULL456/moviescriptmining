CUBE That's my money anyway, Jerry. I earned it. I wrote a lot of hit songs. I been on tour for months. (MORE) 
CUBE (CONT'D) Performing. Gettin' arrested and shit. And you gonna try to gank me? 
JERRY That's ridiculous. 
CUBE Give me my money, Jerry. 
JERRY You're kidding me, right? Who do you think pays for everything? All the hotel rooms, the parties, the transpo? You think that's free? 
Cube closes his eyes. Takes a deep breath. He must literally will himself to not implant his fist in Jerry's face. 
CUBE Why all this now,   Jerry? Back in the beginning, if   you thought we were so good, why   didn't you just give us contracts   then? 
JERRY Nothing's a sure thing, Cube. Even a great talent can crash and burn. Too much ego, too much excess, too many expectations -- it tends to ruin things. You oughta keep that in mind. 
Cube stares hard. Knows exactly what Jerry's implying. 
CUBE I'm gonna ask one more time. Are you sayin' I can't have the money I earned, unless I sign this contract, right now, without showin' it to anybody? 
Jerry just crosses his arms, looks at Cube, says nothing. 
CUBE (CONT'D) Bye, Jerry. 
He turns and walks out of the room -- 
69   INT. DOUBLETREE SUITES - LOBBY - DAY                        69 
Dre, Ren and Yella lounge on the lobby couch, packed bags beside them. And they couldn't be happier. 
REN I'mma get me a El Camino with some gold Daytons and a Phantom top. 
YELLA I can't wait to get out of that "po- man's Porsche" and get me some real shit -- 
Face crumpled with anger, Cube approaches. Drops his bags. 
CUBE Y'all signed that Ruthless contract without a lawyer? 
REN Yeah -- And we got paaaaaid! 
YELLA For $75,000 dollars, I don't give a fuck what's in that contract! 
Dre and Ren chuckle at Yella's candor. 
DRE You ain't signed? 
CUBE Hell naw I ain't signin' that bullshit. Don't y'all think it's a little fucked up that Jerry won't let us show it to nobody? That seem honest to y'all? If he offered us seventy-five thousand, he probably owes us double that. (to Ren) Thought we talked about this, dude? 
REN It is what it is... I don't trust Jerry but I trust Eric. 
Cube's disgusted by their ignorance. Only Dre seems to be considering Cube's words -- 
CUBE At this point, Eric and Jerry in this thing together. Believe dat! 
70   EXT. LEIMERT PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                           70 
The bus is parked back where the tour began. Exhausted, D.O.C. 
exits the bus and heads toward a BURGUNDY CHEVY BLAZER, where SUGE KNIGHT waits to pick him up. D.O.C. throws his bags in the back. Kicks it with Suge for a minute as -- 
Eazy exits the bus with Yella. They watch D.O.C. and Suge. 
EAZY What up with Doc and Suge? 
YELLA Guess that dude's "managing" him now. One day you Bobby Brown's bodyguard, next day you reppin' talent. Everybody wanna get into the act... 
Dre exits, looking discouraged. And we understand why when an equally despondent Cube exits the bus and begins to move away from the crew. Dre catches up to him -- 
DRE Yo Cube-- You can't just sign that shit, homie..? Keep making history..? 
CUBE Naw man, not like this. I'd rather be broke then get fucked -- Why did you sign that shit, Dre? 
DRE Nigga, I got bills to pay -- and I need to put some money in my Momma's hands after Tyree passed. 
CUBE Yo, I get it. Everybody gotta do what they gotta do. They're gonna take care you. You they're bread and butter. 
DRE Cube, we Ruthless. 
CUBE Nah, we NWA. They Ruthless. 
T-BONE (O.S.) You comin', Cube? 
Cube turns to find T-BONE from the Lench Mob and Jinx, waiting for him in his CAR. He looks back at Dre -- I'm out. They pound hug and Cube heads off. Hops into T-Bone's ride. 
BACK WITH DRE, considering the scene as everyone drives away, going in separate directions: 
Cube leaves with T-Bone... Yella leaves with Ren... Eazy leaves with Jerry... And D.O.C. leaves with Suge... 
Dre finds himself all alone, confronting a new reality. 
A71   INT./EXT. T-BONES CAR - MOMENTS LATER                       A71 
Cube rides in the passenger seat, pretty low at this point. No money, no group. JINX MOUTH IS RUNNING, but Cube's in a daze -- doesn't hear a word he's saying. 
JINX Can't believe you left the group, man. What you gonna do now? Guess we gotta start working on some solo stuff, huh? Cube? Cube?! 
As the car pulls up to a stop light, Cube looks over, spots a beautiful YOUNG LADY in a nice jeep on rims. She's looks back over at him, their eyes locked. Is this love at first sight? After a few magical moments. Cube finally speaks. 
CUBE How you doing? My name O'Shea. What's yours? 
KIM Kim. 
CUBE Hey Kim-- You the best thing I've seen all day.

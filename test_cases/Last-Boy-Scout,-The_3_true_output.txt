HALLENBECK Is this a trick question? SARAH I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? Huh?? An awkward pause.   Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says: HALLENBECK No.   We won't open the door. SARAH Thank you. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK (sighs) Nope. Door stays shut. Instead, what I'm gonna do is... (he scoops up the ... I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna put a bullet in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth. One. SARAH If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make you eat that gun. 
HALLENBECK Two. The truth is a beautiful thing. He cocks the hammer.   Arm extended, hand rock steady. SARAH Call your shrink, Joe. I still have the number. Call him and tell him you're losing it, I cannot fucking deal with you like this -- ! HALLENBECK Three.   Last chance. SARAH Joe, dammit -- ! He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger.    And Sarah screams -- 
SARAH Jesus, no -- ! And grabs the gun. Everything freezes. She looks at him.    He looks at her. Understanding occurs. 
CLOSET DOOR swings slowly open, then... And out steps a man in a bathrobe. Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet. None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call. We know this because Joe says: (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Hello, Mike.   Keeping her warm for me? The gun barrel does not waver.    Not an inch. MILLER Easy, Joe.   Don't do nothing dumb. HALLENBECK How as she, Mike? On your finger scale, how was my wife...? MILLER It just happened, Joe.     It just happened. HALLENBECK You call me from here this morning? MILLER She said you were in Vegas. I was gonna leave a message on the machine. HALLENBECK When you found out I was back.       Why didn't you split? MILLER She said relax, he never stops home once he's in the office. HALLENBECK Normally I wouldn't. MILLER (stares at him) You knew? HALLENBECK I suspected. So how about it, Mike? On a scale of one to ten. How was she? MILLER Joe, come on, how long we been friends, huh? HALLENBECK How long? Mmm. I'd say roughly until you put your dick in my wife. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MILLER You gotta understand -- HALLENBECK I know, I know, it just happened. It was an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my week. Sure, Mike. Happen to anybody. (beat) I don't gotta understand anything. Sarah speaks then.   Head down.   Eyes averted. 
SARAH Put the gun down. HALLENBECK Hmmm?  Oh, right, the gun. (sighs) You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts. He pulls the trigger. The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room. Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself. The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head. On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead center. Blows it to pieces. Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor. Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless eyes. HALLENBECK Where was Darian? SARAH She stayed at Cindy's last night. He nods.   Turns and waves the gun at Miller. HALLENBECK Let's take a walk, Buddy. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY The two men come out the back door and cut through the hedge. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb. Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard. Holsters his gun. A neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail. Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur. HALLENBECK Where you want it, Mike?     Head or gut? MILLER Listen, Joe, I -- (stops, sighs) Gut. Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's gut. Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch. Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it. HALLENBECK If I see you again, I'll kill you. Miller nods weakly.    Gasping for breath. HALLENBECK So.   West Hollywood at seven, right? MILLER Huh...? 
HALLENBECK The job.     Seven o'clock, right? MILLER You still... want the job...? HALLENBECK It's two hundred bucks. MILLER Yeah.   I guess it is. He climbs to his feet, still doubled over. MILLER I'm sorry, Joe. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns and stumbles to his car. Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. A dead mask. He walks back toward the hedge. The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth. Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird. Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it. The DOG BARKS and bounds after it. Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition. The CAR BLOWS to pieces. An ERUPTION OF FLAME. Flying glass and metal. The car becomes airborne. Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down. The shockwave catches Hallenbeck.   Slams him ass over teacups. Windows blow in up and down the street. Smoke and fire roll to the sky. The DOG cowers, HOWLING in fear. Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire. Hallenbeck rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and leaves. Clothing scorched. Stares. Eyes glazed. CUT TO: 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AN HOUR LATER A mobile crane hoists what's left of Mike Miller and his Pontiac. Policemen direct traffic, curb bystanders.

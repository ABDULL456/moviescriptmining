SCHMIDT (re Brian to Adcox) You know this rug rat? 
AXE Know him? I practically raised him. (Jewish mom) And he never calls, he never writes... 
Brian shouts over the noise to GRINDLE, 35, one more seat down. 
BRIAN I'm Brian. 
GRINDLE I'm sorry. 
Grindle sticks his nose out the window, sniffs, then begins buckling up his coat. 
GRINDLE Boys, I do believe we have a barbecue... 
As Brian and Adcox fasten up their own equipment -- 
EXT. FACTORY - DAY 
Smoke pours with confused indecision from every window of a five story factory as the pumper and ladder company pull up. 
GRINDLE (staring at confusing smoke) I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it. 
STEPHEN (to Schmidt) Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up. 
Everyone begins strapping on air tanks and masks. Adcox drags the rig's suction line to the hydrant. A beautiful illegally parked Mercedes is blocking the way. 
AXE (to Stephen) Oh these moments do try me... 
STEPHEN (admiring car) Be gentle. 
Whistling to himself, Adcox SMASHES the brass coupling through the passenger window, runs the line through and SMASHES it out the other window before connecting up to the hydrant. 
Stephen and Grindle pull hose off the bed and move out. Brian's so jacked up he can't get his air tank on right. Schmidt calmly helps him into his gear. 
SCHMIDT It's only rock 'n roll, kid. 
Stephen, Adcox and Grindle are crouched at the door, ready to go. Brian takes a hose roll and runs to catch up when he's cut-off by dazed Latin workers shouting incoherently at him in SPANISH. 
STEPHEN Hey, probie! How 'bout it, huh? 
Brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the hose line. Stephen reaches over and re-adjusts Brian's air tank strap. 
STEPHEN You're doing it wrong. 
Stephen eases the door open. Thick smoke rolls sickly out over their heads. 
STEPHEN (to Brian) Stay beside me. 
And in they go... 
INT. BURNING FACTORY - DAY 
Inside the smoke is like liquid lead. Going by feel, they hump the hose up one staircase after another, crawling on their hands and knees toward a dull red glow. Turning a corner, they enter 
INT. BURNING FACTORY - A VAST ROOM - DAY 
Totally ablaze. Brian looks up in wonder at the buffeting waves of flame in the ceiling, at the SCREECHING timbers crumbling to the white-hot floor. At the walls HOWLING in bestial agony. It is the most horrifying, and wonderful thing he has ever seen. 
AXE Wash it to the windows? 
STEPHEN No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on. 
AXE It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it. 
STEPHEN Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling. 
Adcox and Grindle shrug and pull their helmets down tight, expecting the worst. Adcox opens up the nozzle, turning loose a high pressure BLAST OF WATER into the ceiling. The fire SCREAMS in manic anger and HEAVES a cloud of HOWLING steam that WHIRLS back and BAKES them like lobsters. Brian gasps for air as swirling ash batters his facemask. A window somewhere EXPLODES. Somebody shouts. Christ, you can't see anything. Stephen HOOPS in victory. 
STEPHEN (to fire) I knew you were a pussy! C'mon! Steam us! (to firemen) Let's go! 
The chase is on! Going for the throat while the fire's confused and defensive, the firemen SCRAMBLE through the boiling cloud. They hit it in the ceiling, in the walls, forcing it back and back. It HOWLS and CLAWS in anger, furiously throwing cinders and broken timbers in their faces. The walls ECHO with its SCREAMS as it retreats to a corner. 
STEPHEN Ya love it, probie? 
BRIAN I'm in heaven, Lt. 
STEPHEN Hook us up to a stand-pipe. 
Brian runs back to the wall to hook up his hose roll to the building water system. He goes to unscrew the cap with his hydrant wrench but it keeps slipping off the nut. 
STEPHEN Jesus, how 'bout man, huh? We're gonna loose this! 
Brian finally gets it hooked up and runs back.

DAVID and ALISON just stare. BEAN is followed by KEVIN who wears the same ears and teeth. 
DAVID Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to ... Jennifer - could you turn that damn thing down. 
It is quite loud. JENNIFER looks for the remote control. BEAN helpfully picks up a remote control from the sofa and points it across the room. 
ALISON No, that's not for the TV. That's for the ... 
Too late! BEAN punches a button and the lid of the CD player launches the Bambi into the air. 
DAVID sees it. In slow motion he dives dramatically and just misses it.         It smashes on the floor. 
BEAN raises his eyes heavenwards, shakes his head and tuts.        He thinks DAVID is a real Butter Fingers. 
JENNIFER, upset, has found the TV remote and unintentionally switches from the Vampire game to a TV channel. It's very loud. 
ALISON gives DAVID a tearful look, and shakes her head. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE      NIGHT. 
A taxi drives away.      Alison is in it. CUT TO: 
INT.   HALLWAY- NIGHT. 
JENNIFER and KEVIN are in their night clothes. They sit with David on the stairs ~ still looking at the door-Alison left through. 
KEVIN I wish I    could use    that at school. "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings    ... It's    just things between us ain't what they used to be and    I need a    little space, ya know? So I'11 see you around in    a couple    of years, maybe". 
JENNIFER It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga. 
She gets up and walks away. 
DAVID Jen - you don't wanna talk about it? 
JENNIFER It's you and Mom that need to talk. 
DAVID Sure.    You're right. 
KEVIN You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad? 
JENNIFER (FROM HER DOOR) Of course he is. 
KEVIN Are you? 
DAVID Yes, I am.    I must. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   HALL/BEAN'S ROOM.   DAY. 
DAVID heads for Mr BEAN's room, and knocks cautiously on the door. 
BEAN (o. o. v) Enter. 
DAVID enters - Camera follows as DAVID finds his way through BEAN's washing hanging from strings across the room. BEAN is sticking things in a picture album. 
DAVID Hi, am I disturbing you? 
BEAN gives him an affable smile. In a pause before he quite gathers himself to broach the difficult subject, DAVID asks a polite question. 
DAVID May I? 
BEAN acquiesces. He starts from the beginning, with pictures of him as a kid. Always standing on his own. 
Picture of BEAN with mop of frizzy hair, at 16.    DAVID smiles.   BEAN mimes stupid disco dancing. 
DAVID turns another page. It is a sequence      of pictures of BEAN at famous UK locations - Big Ben, Stonehenge, Buckingham     Palace, 10 Downing Street. They are .idiosyncratic because all taken by him     at arms length with his Polaroid - so he never quite makes it squarely into     shot. 
A whole page of Teddy. Then three pages of BEAN's mini with dates, on labels, going way back. 
Then a whole page of garden gnomes. 
DAVID None of your folks here - Family? 
BEAN starts to look for something in particular.      DAVID uses the pause to broach the awful subject. 
DAVID Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've been here twelve all... 
BEAN has    found what he was looking for. It is the picture of the family that he    took from the landing on his first night here. What's left of the Polaroid    of himself, from the mall, that he rescued from BRUTUS, is stuck next to    it. He's even written - 'Bean & Family' - he doesn't realise there's anything    sad about it. But DAVID is rather moved. Pause.

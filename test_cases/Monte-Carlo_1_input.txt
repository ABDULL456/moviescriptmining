0 INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - BEDROOM - DAY 
Meg, holding the apple, sits facing Cordelia, still tied to a chair, the two glaring at each other. 
CORDELIA You will never get away with this. 
MY FATHER-- 
MEG Believe me, nothing would make me happier than having a little talk with your father-- Both their heads swing toward the door when the bell RINGS! Meg jumps to Cordelia, stuffing the apple in her mouth just as she opens it to scream.

Bernard looks up when Meg opens the door a crack. 
MEG Bernard...? He holds out the bottle of wine. 
BERNARD We forgot your prize. 
MEG Oh, I... She glances back into the room behind her, carefully obscuring Bernard's view through the half open door. 
BERNARD I have come at a bad time? 
MEG No. No, Bernard, that's not it.

CONTINUED: 
THUMP! They both hear Cordelia's chair hit the floor inside and Bernard darkens. 
BERNARD I think--. You are busy. I think now I go-- Meg reaches out to stay him with a hand on his arm. 
MEG No. Bernard, wait-- CLICK! Meg and Bernard both turn their heads to look down the corridor when Cordelia sticks her head out the bedroom door into the hall. A beat as Cordelia and Meg lock eyes. DING! The elevator doors open at the end of the hall, closer to Cordelia. She looks back at Meg for an instant then bolts as Meg leaps past Bernard into the hall. 
MEG (CONT'D) Hey! Stop!

Emma models Cordelia's necklace on a stage for over a hundred GUESTS with Domenico fielding bids beside her. 
DOMENICO The bid is three hundred thousand! Alice stands just off to the side on the floor below, between Richard and Jean-Pierre, with Penelope. 
RICHARD so, they all think she's this Cordelia Scott because... 
ALICE It's for a school, Richard-- 
RICHARD In Africa. 
NIKOLAI 
(HEAVILY ACCENTED) Five hundred!

DOMENICO Five hundred thousand! 
ALICE Oh,no... 
JEAN-PIERRE Yes !

DOMENICO Five hundred, five hundred fifty thousand! 
INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SERVICE STAIRS - DAY 
Bernard races to catch up as Meg flies down the stairs. 
BERNARD But, Meg! Why do we run? Meg stops on a landing, turns. 
MEG Bernard, you should stop. You really don't need this. I may be going away for a long time-- 
BERNARD To America? 
MEG Something like that. Look, this is where we should say "au revoir." Bernard smiles and pulls Meg to him, kisses her. 
BERNARD But, I must see how this ends! 0 He grabs her hand and they plunge down the stairs together.

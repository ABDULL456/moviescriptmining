His voice hardens slightly. \nFRANK Are we all set, Alex? \nALEX I'm going to check the storage room, see what else'll travel. I know I put some vintage Armagnac in there, maybe some Porto? He heads down the gangplank. \nFRANK He's a vendor, Dina. It's like drinking with the help. \nDINA \n(DISARMING HIM) Did you pick the wine, sweetie? It's lovely. Frank grins, pleased.

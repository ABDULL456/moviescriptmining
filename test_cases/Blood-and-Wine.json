{"train": "ALEX It's late, Jason. \nJASON I'm going out tonight. Alex exhales. \nALEX You can't'fish all night and work all day. \nJASON Working for you doesn't exactly tax my mind. \nALEX No wonder you drop bottles. \nJASON Fire me. \nALEX Do you do it on purpose? \nJASON Fishing bought me my bike. \n(CONTINUED) \n10 CONTINUED: \nALEX I almost knocked it over trying to get out of the car. \nJASON \n(SARCASTIC) I wasn't sure you were coming home. \nSEVERS The TOASTER OVEN DINGS.

Your mother's asleep. \nSTAIRS \nJASON If you got home on time once in a while, maybe she could skip the chemical help. Alex is also on the stairs. \nALEX You have no idea, none, zip, what goes on in a marriage. \nJASON Yeah, well, I'm learning more than I want to. \n(CONTINUED)' \n10 CONTINUED: (2) \nLANDING UPSTAIRS \nSUZANNE (O .S=.. ) Now what are you arguing about? \nSUZANNE is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular, like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build. \nJASON It's not an argument. \nALEX I asked him to clean up downstairs. \nSUZANNE \n(SOOTHING ALEX) Maybe he hadn't finished- \nALEX A modicum of cooperation, you know? \nJASON A modicum. What's that. Modicum my ass. He pushes past his mother toward his own room. Suzanne follows him down the hallway, leaving. Alex behind. \nSUZANNE I don't like that tone from: you. \nJASON Then go to bed. \nALEX Hey! \nJASON \n(RIGHT BACK) What! \nSUZANNE It's too late for this. \nALEX Jason has gone into his room.

Don't charge starving Chinese so much for these things. \nJASON You ever caught a shark? \nCHEF \n(BIGGER) You ever cook one? \nJASON Lemme -- lemme show you something. Jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display a fresh gash across his arm. \nJASON He was already gaffed onto the side of the boat, good as dead. Two hours dead! And I was still too close to the mouth. Revenge is the last instinct to go, did you know that? The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint. \nCHEF -- Work's a dangerous thing. (smiling with lots of \nTEETH) Nice fin, Jason. He tosses the fins in a cauldron of boiling water, slaps the CASH REGISTER on the side. It RINGS. \n20 EXT.

Alex sniffs Jason's fingers, wrinkles his nose, lets Jason have his hand back. \nALEX You stink. \nJASON I washed. \nALEX There's Wash IN Dries in the glove compartment. Jason opens the compartment, finds the packets, opens one, rubs his hands. \nALEX ... I'm trying here, Jason -- I really am. When you didn't want to go to college, I took your side, I said fine -- I mean, I -didn't finish college, and I've done all right. I gave you a job', a steady check, which is more than anybody else has done. And what do I get back? Shit. I've tried to teach you the business -- the care, the finesse...

Gabriella laughs and looks over her shoulder at him. They're both kids. \nGABRIELLA ugly, isn't it. He grins and relaxes, looks around. \nJASON The fittings are definitely -- yeah on the ugly side. But damn, she's solid. \nGABRIELLA Oh, a boat type. \nJASON (proud, defensive) I like.boats. Gabriella shows him the climatized, built-in wine closet next to the galley.

He laughs. \nJASON Worst kind. \nGABRIELLA \n(CORRECTIVELY) No. \n(A BEAT) You don't appreciate what you have, Jason. It's very poor where I came from. \nJASON Where's that? \nGABRIELLA Venezuela. Do I look it? \nJASON I don't know, I never been there. \nGABRIELLA Well, I don't. My mother's Indian. The India kind of Indian. \n(LAUGHS) Imagine a house where the father asks 'What's for dinner' in Spanish, and the mother answers 'Curry' in Hindi. 'Que hay para cenar' she says, 'Murgee, masala, ghaal.' He says, 'No es importante.' No wonder I'm nuts. \nJASON You don't seem too nuts.

Alex laughs. Frank pushes back his chair. \nFRANK Don't encourage her, Alex. Her mouth is big enough. Dina is hurt. \nFRANK (to the agent) I'll show you that painting in our stateroom. The agent follows him away. \nALEX (kindly; to Dina) Do you want to see the label? She hides her hurt by not looking at him. \nDINA Just open the bottle, Alex. Pour us both a glass. I'm not allowed to drink alone. When she turns her head and looks at him, she's flirting. \n30 INT. BOAT - DAY \nJason has almost finished storing the wine. Gabriella is sitting on a bar stool at the galley,. listening to him, snared by the quiet passion in his voice. \nJASON -- when you're skimming along the water, nothing between you and the bottom of the sea but a layer of wood, your thoughts... end. All that noise inside your head? Gabriella nods, understanding exactly. \nJASON . . . Stops. Dina's VOICE booms over the INTERCOM, startling both of them. The BABY is FUSSING. Gabriella makes a gesture of apology to Jason. \nDINA (V.O.) Gabriella? Are you down there? \nAlex appears at the top of the stairs, surprising Jason. \nALEX I was in the bathroom. He walks down the stairs. A wooden case of liquor is by the terrace doors, where he left it. \nALEX Give me a hand, will you?

VICTOR SPANSKY neatly stacks his modest winnings. He's tall, thick-shouldered, 55, with a gray crew-cut, tinted glasses, and a smoker's cough. He does nothing in a hurry. \nVICTOR \n(TO DAVE) You didn't lose that much. \nALEX There's an optimist in every game. \nDAVE \n(PISSED) Alex, I don't appreciate -- \nALEX (overriding htm, \nUNRUFFLING HIM) No, I'm saying... the guy who sits down at the table with a loser's attitude... loses even if he wins -- which he won't. He's got no juice flowin'. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n34 CONTINUED: \nALEX (CONT'D) He's got peepee in his veins! Life for that guy's a habit and stained pants. You know what I mean? Dave laughs, feeling better. \nDAVE \nNOT \nALEX Try. \nDAVE Good night. They all AD-LIB \"Good night,\" \"See you next week,\" etc., as they file out. Alex and Victor are the last in the room. Alex puts on his jacket. \nVICTOR Paltry pickings tonight. Alex looks at the small amount of cash on the table. \nALEX You want to cut for what's here. Victor chuckles.. \nVICTOR Sure. Why not. He pushes his cash forward into a pot with Alex's. Alex fans the deck across the table. \nALEX \n(CONVERSATIONALLY) What-are you doing with your life, Victor?. Victor makes a small gesture, indicating the cards. \nVICTOR This, more or less. He pulls a card -- he has good hands -- and turns it up. A king of spades. A smile tugs at his mouth. \nVICTOR Beat that. Alex produces the Polaroid of Dina's necklace from his inside jacket pocket. \n(CONTINUED) \n34 CONTINUED: (2) He flicks it on the table next to Victor's king. Victor's gaze clicks from the photo to Alex, back to the photo. He slowly reaches out and picks it up. \nVICTOR Very pretty. I remember when it was the cover of the auction catalogue. The Duchess of Windsor's baubles. Bought for a young wife, I remember. Who I'm sure worked just as hard as the Duchess. \nALEX it's appraised at a million three hundred thousand dollars. a laugh. Victor tosses the photo back on the table with \nVICTOR And they say there's no inflation. \nALEX I have access. Victor shakes his head no. \nVICTOR I'm retired. \nALEX And broke. \n38 INT. JASON'S ROOM \nJason throws himself out of bed and turns on his STEREO, cranks the volume. He doesn't want to hear their VOICES. \n39 INT. MASTER-BEDROOM \nAlex and Suzanne hear the MUSIC.

That's what I thought. \nAT THE WINE ROOM \nDINA \n(NEUTRALLY) A month alone with Frank. Alex chuckles as he starts to inspect the humidifier. \nALEX Second honeymoon. \nDINA The first one was bad enough. She's standing too close to him, but he has no room to maneuver away. He fiddles with the box. \nALEX -- It may need a part replaced. \nDINA Nice suit. You always dress well, Alex. She brushes the lint off his jacket and leaves her hand there. \nALEX \n(GENTLY) --,Dina... this is not a great idea. Used to getting her way, she's not easily dissuaded. \n(CONTINUED) \n42 CONTINUED: \nDINA \n(SEDUCTIVELY) How can you tell? She moves up against him. Alex can't will himself to resist.

They fired her. (with a snigger) Don't pay to be too good-looking in these jobs. Victor interrupts the gossip. He -sounds exactly like a repairman. \nVICTOR I got a schedule to keep, Mr_ Gates. Is this gonna be another day? \n(CONTINUED) \n50 CONTINUED: \nALEX It can't wait. \n(TO MIKE) He'll lose his entire wine collection if the humidifier isn't fixed. \nMIKE \n(TO VICTOR) What's your name? \nVICTOR Harold Freeman. Mike notes the name \"Harold\" stitched onto his coveralls. \nMIKE Okay. Stay here. I'll get the keys. He rides away on his cart. Victor sits down in the shade to wait.

He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with injured dignity. Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in front of her. Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does. She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion. He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to \nCLANK. \nJASON I'm sorry.

The jeweler takes it out with respect and holds it under his loupe. If Jason's nervous, it doesn't show. \nJASON It belonged to my mother. The jeweler's heard every version. He doesn't care. \nJEWELER - .Price is the same. I can give you eighty-five hundred. \n115 EXT. BEACH - DAY 115 \nThe classified section already folded and marked beside her, Suzanne has propped herself on her elbows. She's looking out to sea. Talking heads bob like buoys, the waders. She notices, some distance away, a man in a suit walking along the beach. The image amuses her. He's moving in her direction. She finally recognizes Jason and raises her hand. \nSUZANNE \n(CALLING OUT) Hey, sailor... She puts on her hat to cut the glare. From under the brim she admires his approach. \nSUZANNE (as he reaches her) ... Look at you. What's the occasion? Jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds. \nJASON You don't need another grab-ass job. I been out talking to peoplel \nALEX \n(PLEASED) They can't be too far. Victor stares at him. \nVICTOR I never understand your optimism. \nALEX Or he wouldn't have lied. \nHENRY (O.S.) Hey, mister! \nALEX \n(TO VICTOR) I think you made a friend. Victor turns around, Alex keeps walking. \nHENRY is in the doorway to the bar. \nHENRY What's it to you if I see the kid? Victor smiles. \n118 EXT. DRYDOCK - LONG SHOT - DAY 118 \nFrom a distance we see Jason follow a beefy, jeans-wearing salesman into the building. \n119 ' INT. DRYDOCK - LONG SHOT - DAY 119 \nThe Salesman walks Jason past the vertical rows of boats, stacked from ceiling to floor, extolling the virtues of his stock. Jason inspects a modest boat, takes out cash. \n120 EXT. GULF - BOAT - DAY 120 \nJason is helming a classic wooden fishing boat, THE HERCULES II, old and not too big, but with good lines. He's purely happy. \n121 EXT. WATER - DAY \nJason steers toward the beach and drops anchor. There's a cabin among the palmettos. No car. \n122 INT. CABIN - DAY \nJason comes into the cabin. \nJASON (just to be sure) Mom? The cabin is silent. He uses his fishing knife to pop loose a section of the cheap wall paneling. Behind it, a square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically starts to jam the paneling back in place. It won't hold. \n123 EXT. CABIN - DAY \nSuzanne takes a flat of geraniums out of the trunk and sets them on the porch. She opens the door. \n124 INT. CABIN - DAY \nJust as Suzanne steps through the screen door, Jason sees that his tackle box is open, the velvet pouch in plain sight. He kicks the top closed, bends to lock it. \nSUZANNE \n(CASUALLY) They'll think you stole it. He looks up at her, caught. She's walking toward the kitchen sink to wash the nursery dirt off her hands. She looks out the window at the boat again. \nSUZANNE Nice boat. (over her shoulder) Are you allowed just to run around with it? 'His tension ebbs. He picks up his tackle box. \nJASON I forgot my tackle box. \nSUZANNE -- Don't take advantage, Jason. They trusted you with the job. \n(CONTINUED) \n124 CONTINUED: He kisses her quickly. \nJASON It's not a problem. He escapes out the door. \n125 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nAlex is sitting on the bed, dialing a number. He can see Victor shirtless in the bathroom. (His scars surprise us). Victor is trying with effort to suppress a cough. \n126 INT. CONDO, KITCHEN - NIGHT \nGabriella is cooking herself dinner. \nGABRIELLA Hello? She's greedily grateful to hear Alex's voice. \nGABRIELLA -- Hi! I saw on the news there's rain in San Francisco. Are you wet and miserable? \n127 INT. MOTEL - NIGHT \nExhausted, Alex stretches out on the bed to talk to her. \nALEX Napa's farther north. Victor comes out of the bathroom. He's waiting for news. \n128 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 128 \nALEX How about for me? Victor takes out the photo of Alex with the necklace and holds it up for him. \nVICTOR Nobody's seen this yet. \nALEX You're sick. I'll do it. Alex throws open the door and barrels out of the car. \n135 INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY \nThe jeweler who bought the diamond from Jason lays it on a velvet pad for Alex, who's posing as the insurance investigator. \n(CONTINUED) \n135 CONTINUED: \nJEWELER (with a shrug) Said it was his mother's. \nALEX A seventeen-year-old kid waltzes in with a diamond as big as your toenail, and you don't wonder?? You shouldn't have touched iti You know that! All right, okay. When we recover the rest of the necklace, I'll be back. Do not, do not sell it. I'll see what I can do for you, Raines. \nJEWELER i appreciate that. \n136 INT. BAR - DAY \nVictor and Alex are having a beer near the wide-screen TV. A game is on. \nALEX Smart lady. She lets Jason make the sale. They get caught, he's underage, and she don't know a thing. I gotta give her credit. \nVICTOR You have interesting taste in women. Alex's gaze wanders to the game, but he can't get interested. \n137 EXT. VICTOR'S CAR - DAY \nIt barrels up the highway, passing the same landmarks Suzanne and Jason did. \n138 INT. CAR - DAY (TRAVELING) \nVictor is driving, Alex reading the map. He circles a town name. Victor cranes to see it. \n139 EXT. DOCKS - LATE DAY \nA storm is blowing in, and Jason walks quickly along the docks to his boat and swings aboard. \n140 EXT. BOAT - LATE DAY \nThe waves have already started to slap against the sides of the boat. Jason tosses over his fenders and secures them to protect the boat from the pilings. He starts toward the cabin. The lock has been popped. The door is slightly ajar. He hears a NOISE inside. He draws his knife. \n141 INT. CABIN - LATE DAY \nJason throws open the door. A figure is bent over in the galley. It turns, and by the light of the refrigerator Jason recognizes Henry. \nJASON Jesus, Henry... What the hell you doing?... How'd you know this was my boat?? \nHENRY I saw you cast off. Good little sport boat you got, too. Oh, whoa -- hear that? \nJASON \n(PARANOID) Where -- what?? Henry rubs his stomach. \nHENRY Right here, man. I ain't been eating my share since my fishing partner ran off. Without so much as goodbye/good luck. Jason blows out a breath. \nJASON It's complicated. \nHENRY \n(NODDING) Always is. The boat is rockirg now. The WIND has picked up. They hear the CLANKING and RUBBING of the other boats. Jason starts checking all the hasps and latches while Henry eats the sandwich he made. \nJASON So why are you on the Gulf? \n(CONTINUED) \n141 CONTINUED: \nHENRY My baby finally sank on me. Right at the dock. I thought I'd work charter for awhile. (moving to help Jason with the latches) -- Need a crew? \nJASON I don't know. Maybe. \nHENRY That's not why I came looking for you. Jason is checking the engine. Out of Henry's sight, he surreptitiously reaches inside a hidden compartment. \nHIS HAND wraps around the concealed pouch and withdraws, reassured. \nJASON secures the engine hatch. \nHENRY A guy offered me fifty bucks to tell him where you were. Sick old motherfucker. Big as God. Tried to say he was your stepfather. \nJASON \nTHEIR POV Jason's white face is turned toward them in Suzanne's car. \nALEX Easy, easy -- he'll see us. \nVICTOR It's raining too hard. \n150 INT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT \nJason looking out the back window sees only the headlights and rain. \nJASON Still with us. \nSUZANNE Maybe it's just a tourist cruising around with his head up his butt. Neither of them believes that. \n(CONTINUED) \n150 CONTINUED: \nSUZANNE ... How about Mexico? The Sea of Cortez? Your father fished for marlin there. The biggest catch he ever had. sharp left, She sees a side road coming up. She hangs a skidding into the turn, traction holding. \n151 INT. VICTOR'S CAR - NIGHT \nVictor can't make the turn in time. \nALEX \nTURN1 \nVICTOR Relax. She's not going anywhere. He brakes and calmly reverses in the rain. \nALEX I just need to talk to her. \nVICTOR Last time you talked, she almost crushed your skull. \n(TRAVELING) 152 \n152 INT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT \nSuzanne is driving fast. \nSUZANNE Anything? \nJASON \n(CHECKING) Not a_car in sight. \nSUZANNE You sure? \nHIS POV The headlights turn onto the road. \nSUZANNE hears his silence and looks back herself just as he looks forward. \n(CONTINUED) \n152 CONTINUED: \nJASON Mom! Face the road! You're drifting! She looks back as now bright headlights light them up. A truck HORN BLASTS. \nSUZANNE -- Shit! She 'spins the wheel to avoid a head-on, but in so doing she clips the curb and loses control. She throws an arm across Jason to protect him. The car rolls onto its top, scraping across the road. \n153 EXT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT \nThe upside-down car rips through a fence, slides down off the road. The engine dies. The only SOUND is the SPINNING back TIRE and the WINDSHIELD that now caves in. \n154 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nVictor swerves to the side of the road. Alex leaps out of the car and runs toward the wreck. Victor follows at a slower pace, opening his umbrella. He's still eating his apple. He sees a neighboring house light come on in response to the crash. \nAT THE WRECK Alex is trying to open the jammed door when Victor reaches him. \nVICTOR We don't have much time. Through the window they can see Suzanne and Jason, both unconscious, limbs entangled, covered in glass. Suzanne is hemorrhaging from a gash in her side. Her leg twitches in spasm. Car headlights pass by on the road. \nALEX We need to get some help! \nVICTOR Already on the way, I'm afraid. \n(CONTINUED) \n154 CONTINUED: Alex kicks out what remains of the back side window and slithers into the car. Victor calls in after him. \nVICTOR Open the trunk, please. He walks toward the back. \n155 INT. CAR - NIGHT \n(CONTINUED) \n163 CONTINUED: \nALEX (dodging the question) I flew straight back from Napa when I heard. You hit your head pretty hard. Jason struggles to sit up, his equilibrium not fully restored. \nJASON Where's Mom? -- How's Mom? Alex sits down on the bed with him to break the news. \nALEX \n(QUIETLY) I'm sorry, Jason... I'm so sorry. Jason stares at him. He hasn't absorbed the fact. \nALEX She didn't make it as far as the hospital. Horror and rage flood Jason's face. \nJASON \nN000! He seizes the empty I.V. stand and hurls it at Alex, who throws up his arm protectively. Jason tackles Alex under his guard, smashing him into the metal dresser. Alex's head snaps backward, cracking the mirror. \nJASON -- You killed her, you fuckl Alex tries to hold him, eventually in a forced bear-hug. \nALEX -- Don't, don't -- \n(CALLING OUT) I need someone in here! \nJASON \n(WEAKLY) Let go of me! Alex holds him close. He collapses in Alex's arms. An ORDERLY hurries in, followed by a Nurse. \nORDERLY We'll take care of him. \n(CONTINUED) \n163 CONTINUED: (2) Alex hesitates, then goes out. \n164 INT. ADMISSIONS OFFICE - DAY \nAlex is conferring quietly with a staff member behind the counter. \n165 EXT. SUZANNE'S CABIN - DAY 165 \nVictor picks the lock. Alex doesn't follow him inside. \n166 INT. CABIN - DAY 166 \nVictor hits every spot where amateurs hide their treasures. \nA SERIES OF CUTS 167 A) Victor's hand lifts the tub drain. B) Victor feels the back of a dresser. \nVICTOR \n(CALLING OUT) It'd be nice to have some help. C) Victor unscrews the trap under the kitchen sink. D) Et cetera. \n168 EXT. CABIN - DAY 168 \nAlex is sitting on the stairs, staring out at the Gulf. He gives no indication of having heard Victor. \n169 INT. CABIN - DAY 169 \nVictor lays his cheek along the living room wall to eyeball it for irregularity. A smile hoists his cheeks. He pops the paneling loose. His smile collapses. The niche carved between the'studs is empty. He rests his head against the wall. \n170 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nAlex walks down the corridor to Jason's room. He taps on the door. There's no answer. He pushes open the door. The room is empty, the bed stripped. Alex barrels out of the room to confront the tired young DOCTOR he sees walking down the hall. \nALEX Where's my son?? \nDOCTOR \n(PUZZLED) I released him this morning. \nALEX You let an underage boy with a head injury walk out of here by himself?? \nDOCTOR It was only a concussion. He's fine. He said you were in the lobby. Nothing to be gained, Alex whirls around and strides away. \n171 EXT. ROAD - DAY \nJason is running down the road, his face contorted. \n172 EXT. BEACH - DAY \nJason keeps running onto the sand. He kicks off his shoes and plunges into the water and swims. Swims until he's exhausted and gasping. He tips his head back in the water and screams his grief to the pitiless sky. \n173 EXT. STREET - NIGHT \n(CONTINUED) \n176 CONTINUED: (3) \nJASON Let's finish what we started. Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances. His fingers scissor her nipple. \nJASON Just don't tell me that you love me. He peels off his T-shirt. \nGABRIELLA (in a whisper) I love you. He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're both naked. They begin to make love. \nGABRIELLA Wait. Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back. \nGABRIELLA This way. She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her. Jason moves now rapidly. \nGABRIELLA Slowly. Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a young man in a long time. \nGABRIELLA \n(IN SPANISH) What are you doing to me? \n(IN ENGLISH) Don't come, not yet. They move as one, their passion enveloping them. He makes her come first. Then, when her boay flattens, he also comes and he's lying on top of her, his face alongside hers, their breath gentling. Finally, they lie side.by side. \nGABRIELLA Will you get me a towel? With warm water. \n(CONTINUED) \n176 CONTINUED: (4) He kisses her and gets up. If she didn't love him before, she does now. \n177 INT. THE BATHROOM \nWhile he runs the water to'warm it, he looks at himself naked in the mirror. His face crumples. He no longer knows what he's doing. \n178 INT. MASTER BEDROOM \nHe brings the towel back to Gabriella, who wipes herself. Her mood, too, has sobered. \nGABRIELLA (after a moment) Are you going to kill me, too? \nJASON \n(REPELLED) No! \nGABRIELLA You'll have to. I'll know. I'll be a witness. I'll know you planned it. \nJASON -- Would you do that? \nGABRIELLA \n(SOFTLY) I like-you too much to let you kill him. Jasonstarts to put on his clothes: \nGABRIELLA I need him, Jason. \nJASON \n(FURIOUS) You don't -- you don't! \nGABRIELLA I'm not going back to Caracas! You don't know how we live there. She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away. \n(CONTINUED) \n178 CONTINUED: \nGABRIELLA \n(GROWING FRANTIC) You have to leave now, Jason. \nJASON What are you talking about? This is my home. I'm home. She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade him. Jason thinks of his next step, a plan. \nGABRIELLA \n(COLDLY) This is not your room, though, is it. Jason starts toward the door. \nJASON You're never going to marry him, Gabriella. \nGABRIELLA Watch me. He closes the door with a solid CLICK. She starts to cry, and still crying, she pulls the sheets off the bed, she has to change the sheets. \n179 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nJason leans against the wall, his eyes squeezed shut, listening to her CRY. \n180 EXT. CONDO - DAY \nAlex carries his suitcase toward the condo. \n(CONVERSATIONALLY) where'd Jason go? \n184 INT. CONDO WEIGHT ROOM - DAY \nJason is working out alone in the little gym when in the mirror he sees Alex come through the door. He keeps lifting. Alex sits down on the bench beside him. Jason ignores him. \nALEX You have something that belongs to .me, Jason -- and I want it back. \nJASON It's not yours. \nALEX \n(HARDER) Either way. Jason continues to lift. Finally: \nJASON Did you know the thing's worth over a million dollars? What a fucking stupid way to spend money. \nALEX I was holding it for someone. These are dangerous people. \n(CONTINUED) \n184 CONTINUED: The bar wobbles with Jason's laugh.. Alex moves behind and spots him, unnecessarily. \nALEX Don't screw around with me, Jason. He's in a position to crush Jason's windpipe. Jason shoves the barbell up in his face, finishing the set and re-racking. He reaches for his towel and wipes his face, his expression hidden. \nJASON I don't know where it is anymore. You killed the only person who did. \nALEX It was an accident! What did I have to do with it? Jason wads up his towel and throws it at Alex. \nJASON There was a car following us! \nALEX Did you see who was in it? Jason shakes his head no. \nALEX I met one of these guys. Tall, weird-looking fucker with.a gray crew-cut. (letting out a breath) These people you don't steal from. Whoever was following Suzanne is going to come after you, too. Haven't you figured that out? For the first time Jason wavers.; it's a plausible alternative, but one that makes him guilty instead. \nJASON Who are they? Alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper. \nALEX Doesn't matter. Give the necklace back to me, and we'll split the handling commission. His ingratiating smile offends Jason. He doesn't trust Alex. He shakes his head. \n(CONTINUED) \n184 CONTINUED: (2) \nJASON She never told me where she kept it. Alex doesn't believe him either. His hand. rests on a dumbbell, and for a murderous instant he's about to pick it up and use it on Jason. He lifts his hand away. \n185 INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nVictor is lying on his bed, the respirator beside him, while he talks on the phone to Alex. He looks dreadful. \nVICTOR Nice boy like that, the money means diddlyshit. And, personally, I suspect he'd rather die than tell you. So get a blowtorch, and use it on the girl until he cooperates. \n186 INT. ALEX'S.DEN - NIGHT \nAlex sits hunched over the desk, the phone in his hand, thinking. \nVICTOR (V.0.) .. Just as an example, Alex. \nALEX He's gonna make a move. \nVICTOR (V.0.) When he does, I'll be there. \nALEX Okay. He hangs up and rocks back in his chair. \n187 INT. VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 187 \nVictor attaches his mask, breathes in oxygen. He turns off the light. His breathing deepens. \n188 INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 188 \nGabriella has already gone to bed. The lights are off. Alex slides into bed beside her with a soft groan. He reaches for her comfort. \n(CONTINUED) \n188 CONTINUED: \nALEX (muffled against her \nSKIN) I'm never leaving you again. He starts to caress her. \nGABRIELLA -- I'm already asleep, honey. \nALEX \n(LIGHTLY) Wake up. She realizes he isn't going away. She rolls onto her back. Her arms go around him.- Alex kisses her, long and deep. \nWAITRESS Refill, hon? He doesn't even hear her. \n195 INT. CONDO - DAY \nGabriella goes out the door. \n196 EXT. CONDO TERRACE - DAY \nFoot up on the lowest crossbar of the balcony railing, Alex leans on his crossed arms and watches her step into a cab. He's pleased. \nHIS POV Gabriella waves to him. \n197 INT. MARKETPLACE - DAY (LATER) 197 \nGabriella walks through the stalls, looking for Jason and spies him at the counter. The paper is folded beside him. She sits down next to him. \nGABRIELLA Okay. Here I am. What is it? Do you know how much a cab costs? \nJASON I saw a guy following me... I thought you weren't safe. I was going to tell you to go stay at your \nCOUSIN'S -- She starts to swivel off the stool to leave. He grabs her hand. \nJASON \n(HARDER) -- Hey! \nGABRIELLA I'm so sick of this. You'd say anything! He hands her the newspaper. \nGABRIELLA \nWHAT -- \nJASON Read it. \n198 INSERT: THE HEADLINE 198 at the bottom of the page reads, \"Duchess of Windsor Jewels/Stolen From Socialite,\" with a picture of the Duchess herself in her glory days, necklace around her throat. \nGABRIELLA reads the headline and starts to laugh. \nGABRIELLA There is such a thing as justicel Dina's necklace. Couldn't happen to a better person. \nJASON Alex stole it. \n(CONTINUED) \n198 CONTINUED: \nGABRIELLA You really hate him. \nJASON The reason I know is because I stole it from him. Her eyes widen. \nVICTOR his face concealed among the candles is trying to figure out what drama is going on between Jason and Gabriella. He can read their faces, but not their lips. \nJASON AND GABRIELLA \nGABRIELLA ... The sonofabitch. That's why he went out with me. He was trying to use me! (the thought hits her) They'll think I'm part of it! The maid who got fired?? \nJASON You weren't a maid. \nGABRIELLA What difference does it make?? \nJASON We're going to the Gulf. He throws money down for the check. \n199 EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY \nJason guns the motorcycle into the street, Gabriella holds him tight. Victor's car merges into traffic several cars behind them. \n(TRAVELING) 200 \n200 INT. VICTOR'S CAR - DAY \nvictor is enjoying himself a bit. He fiddles with the RADIO, finds MUSIC he likes. \n201 EXT. CAR - DAY \nThe RADIO MUSIC playing, Victor weaves through traffic. He keeps the motorcycle in sight. \n202 EXT. MOTORCYCLE - DAY \nJason checks in his mirrors. \nIN THE MIRROR- He catches sight of victor's car, the same one that was following his mother. \nJASON accelerates. Gabriella nuzzles his neck. \n", "test1_input": "BLOOD AND WINE \nWritten by \nNick Villiers \nSECOND DRAFT \nDECEMBER 12, 1994 \nFADE IN: \nA PAIR OF HANDS men's hands, nicely groomed, hold a small white terry towel spoiled by blood-red spots. The hands rinse the towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay. A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the floor. \nALL IN CLOSEUP The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a hook and walks from \nTHE CELLAR and up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid- forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying the open bottle by the neck. \n2 INT. WINE STORE - NIGHT \nStill seen from behind, the man emerges from the cellar into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed. ceiling, vaguely European. He walks along a narrow aisle of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He glances about nervously. There are shutters on the storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man. He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store, the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile. ALEX GATES. He speaks nonchalantly toward the room. \nALEX Twenty people tonight. I got a South Beach widow, a plastic surgeon -- they actually came together. \n(A BEAT) These people -- all they really want is something to brag about at dinner parties. He swigs from the bottle of white wine, grimaces, detours behind the counter, and spits the mouthful into the plastic lined wastebasket. He throws the bottle away. \n(CONTINUED) \n2 CONTINUED: There's a basket of baguettes on the counter. Alex breaks off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of the wine. Still chewing, he walks toward the tasting room. \nALEX There I was, passing the wine, passing the bread, I suddenly felt like the priest at Masst Or maybe Mass started out as a wine tasting, and Jesus was a salesman. what do you think? He goes into \nTHE TASTING ROOM It seems empty except for a large wooden table, folding chairs in disarray, open bottles clustered at one end of the table. A chalkboard on the wall has CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE written across it at the top, vintages listed underneath. The woman's voice that replies is Gabriella's. \nGABRIELLA (0.S.) (with a throaty laugh) Maybe I should get dressed. Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her panties and a shirt. In her mid-twenties she has striking South American looks. GABRIELLA VASQUEZ. She's sipping red wine from a plastic glass. \nGABRIETM I don't want to spoil a religious experience. \nALEX -- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf? He throws away some of the glasses. \nALEX Duboeuf has a nose and a palate -- like a gift from God. He can taste a single grape before the harvest... and describe the beaujolais it's going to produce. She laughs. \nGABRIELLA Oh, you have competition. \n(CONTINUED) \n2 CONTINUED: (2) \nALEX \n(SLIGHTLY ANNOYED) You know how many bottles I have in this store? Open any one of 'em, I'll tell you the vintage and vintner, b lindfolded. He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on the floor. He doesn't see her slip off her panties. She walks behind him, twirling them into a tight band. She whips them over his eyes. He laughs. \nGABRIELLA Okay. Show me. \nALEX Victoria's Secret 95. She passes her glass under his nose. \nALEX Gabriella, I picked these wines. \nGABRIELLA So what is it? \nALEX All I can smell is your perfume. She laughs. \nGABRIELLA I'm not wearing any. \nALEX I even bought it for you. She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers her breast to the glass and then to his mouth. \nGABRIELLA Tell me now. He kisses her wet breast. \nALEX \n(WITHOUT HESITATION) Beychevelle '83. Lot of body. Very aggressive. He pulls off the panty blindfold, kisses her on the mouth softly, then fully. \n(CONTINUED) \n2 CONTINUED: (3) \nGABRIELLA \n(LOW) -- I lo e y u, Alex. \nV O \n3 INT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER) \n", "test1_true": "GABRIELLA Don't think you have to say it because .1 say it, Alex. \n(SMILING BRIGHTLY) Doesn't mean anything.. \nALEX It means something to me. \nGABRIELLA \n(EASED) We're good together, aren't we. Alex lets out a breath. \nALEX Oh, yeah... We're pretty good. He kisses her goodbye, unlocks the door. She goes out to her Honda Civic. Alex doesn't wait to see her drive off before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting room. \n4 INT. TASTING ROOM - NIGHT \nAlex straightens the last chair and starts to extract air from the open bottles. He hears a quiet CLANK of METAL. Instantly alert, he reaches for his jacket and turns off the-light. \n5 INT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT \nBehind the cash register Alex opens a drawer and takes out a revolver. ze thumbs the safety off. The NOISES RECUR, like someone trying to break in through the back door from the parking lot. Alex slings his jacket casually over the gun. \n6 EXT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT \nAlex throws open the back door; he's counting on the element of surprise. \nHIS POV His red Cadillac convertible is idling nose.to the chain locked across the parking lot. A MAN in his twenties, whose tropical shirt fairly glows under the security lights, is using a pair of bolt cutters on the chain. \nALEX \n(ADVANCING) You think you're gonna steal my car, asshole? The younger man whirls around. \nYOUNG MAN You scared me, man. A middle-aged man, a REPO MAN, calls out lazily from behind the wheel. \nREPO MAN This is not your car, sir. This car belongs to the Star Leasing Company. Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a higher wattage than the security lights. \nREPO MAN I can collect either the money or the car. Given how much you owe, I figure it's the car. The younger man has almost hacked through the chain. \nALEX Pop the. trunk. \nREPO MAN We inventory the property at the yard. He keeps his eye on the chain, ready to gun the engine as soon as the exit is clear. \nALEX I just want to show you something. Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alex's charm; the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the still-running car. \n(CONTINUED) \n6 CONTINUED: In his hand he has the locking \"Club\" Alex usually uses to secure his. steering wheel. He's not stupid. Amused, Alex takes a step back, palms up. \nYOUNG MAN What are you doing? The repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk. \nALEX Do you drink? \nREPO MAN Not on the job. What is this, booze? \nALEX Two cases of single malt whiskey aged in the barrel before he was born. \nREPO MAN The Caddy's overdue. \nALEX So are you. Drink it with the kid. Teach him what smooth is. Enjoy yourselves. Isn't that worth a few days' breather... \n(A BEAT) My accountant's a fuck-up. So am I, maybe, for not firing him. The bolt cutters clip through. The chain falls. \nYOUNG MAN We're clear. \n7 INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nAlex is driving fast, top down, Samba MUSIC loud on the STEREO. He keeps time on the wheel as the Miami skyline cruises by. \nEXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nAlex turns into the garage of an expensive condominium building before the gate has slid all the way open. The TIRES SQUEAL as he powers the car around the corner. \n(CONTINUED) \n8 CONTINUED: \nA DUCATI MOTORCYCLE hogs his space. Alex lays the car in tightly. He has to squeeze out the door. He bumps the Ducati. It starts to topple; he grabs it before it goes over. \n9 INT. CONDO - NIGHT \nAlex lets himself in. The entry ALARM starts to BEEP. He turns it off and resets it. The light has been left on in the kitchen. \n10 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJASON, a handsome, troubled 17-year-old with long, dark hair, is filing barbs off a pile of fishing hooks on the center island. He looks harder and wiser than his years. Tackle is strewn everywhere. Some spaghetti remains in the pot it was cooked in and Jason's knife is standing upright in it. Alex walks into the kitchen. He makes an effort to be pleasant, although he's irritated by the mess, by the motorcycle. \n", "test1_id": 2889, "test2_input": "SUZANNE' -- Extra syrup? Jason returns. \nJASON We'll starve. The waitress laughs as she strolls away. \nSUZANNE I'm hungry. He's worried about the jeweler. \nJASON Let's pack it up, picnic on the beach someplace. \nSUZANNE (with a grin) What a romantic. \n95 EXT. CAR - DAY 95 \nAs Jason and Suzanne reach the car, he sees the jeweler on the sidewalk now, outside the store, gesticulating to a sign painter. \nJASON \nMOM -- He wants to tell her he took the necklace. \nSUZANNE \n(BREEZILY) -- No, 1111 drive. The jeweler happens to glance in their direction. Jason ducks into the car, unnoticed. \n96 EXT. PIER - DAY 96 \nJason and Suzanne are sitting on a small, rickety pier, eating from the takeout boxes open on their laps. \nSUZANNE -- I feel... exhilarated. \nJASON Adrenalin does that. \nSUZANNE -- It ain't adrenalin, it's freedom. And she slips her wedding ring off her finger and hurls it overhand as far as she can. It drops into the sea. \nSUZANNE \n(EXULTANT) I don't want one goddamn thing of \nHISS She eats with gusto. Jason is staring at the water. \nJASON I can't believe you did that. \n97 INT. CAR - LATE DAY (TRAVEL?NG) 97 \nSuzanne is driving now.

She doesn't think he's going to answer her. \n(CONTINUED) \n97 CONTINUED: \nJASON I didn't even say goodbye. \nSUZANNE It'll work itself out. People manage. We're here. This is what you always wanted. \nJASON -- How much money do we have? Suzanne doesn't reply. \n98 EXT. MOTEL - LATE DAY 98 \nAt the reception window Suzanne is checking in with the MOTEL OWNER, a solidly-built, ruddy woman in her fifties who shouldn't wear sleeveless blouses. Suzanne has her wallet open. Her fingers hesitate at the credit card. \nOWNER There's a cash discount. Ten percent. \nSUZANNE \n(SMILING) Sounds like cash. She starts to count it out. \n99 EXT. MOTEL POOL - LATE DAY 99 \nEnsconced at a table under an umbrella, Jason is writing on a paper towel. \nJASON (V.O.) Dear Gabriella. I don't know if you'll get this letter. I don't know if I'll send it. All I know is that for some reason I need to write it... \nSUZANNE AND THE OWNER cross the parking lot. \nSUZANNE \n(CALLING) Jase! He crumples the paper towel.

Suzanne laughs. \n100 EXT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 100 \nJason is sitting on the lawn chair outside the room door, working on his letter again under the yellow bug light. The Coke MACHINE HUMS noisily next to him. \nJASON (V.0.) That day on the boat made me realize I understand the sea better than I do the world. \n101 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 101 \nSuzanne stirs awake, disoriented, spooked. \nSUZANNE Jason? She sits up in bed. Jason comes in from outside. \nJASON I'm right here. Suzanne shoves her fingers through her damp hair, swallows to clear her voice. \nSUZANNE ... I dreamed I was in jail. You'd come to see me, you were on the other side of the plastic -- like at the bank?. And you were talking, but I couldn't hear you. I put my ear to the holes and I couldn't hear you, but your mouth was moving. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n101 CONTINUED: \nSUZANNE (CONT'D) And then I realized you couldn't talk anymore. He'd cut your vocal cords, like that dog next door. \nJASON What dog? She lies down again. \nSUZANNE- When you were a kid? \nJASON \n(GENTLY) -- I'm on watch. Don't worry. \n102 EXT. CAR - DAY \nThe. car speeds north. Alongside, the Gulf shimmers under the mirror of the sky. \nJASON (V.O.) -- I know what lure to use to catch any fish in the water, but what's the lure for a woman? Truth? Lies? \n103 INT. ANOTHER MOTEL - DAY 103 \nA tint combed through her hair, the plastic cap tied in a rakish bow, Suzanne lays out what remains of her cash by denomination.

PIER - DAY 104 \nJason is fishing. \nJASON (V.0.) -- I caught a fish that had three hooks grown through his lips. Three times he'd gotten away. He kept taking the hook. \n105 EXT. PIER - DAY (LATER) 105 \nJason is gutting and skinning his catch. \nJASON (V.0.) It occurs to me that you're the fisherman, not me. I can feel the tension of the line. I've taken the hook just like he did. \nCUT TO: \nA MAP OF THE GULF 106 Coastal towns have been crossed out, one after the other. \n107 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 107 \nAlex, stitches in his head, pores over the map while Victor talks on the phone. He circles a new town on the Gulf, farther north. \nVICTOR -- eight-faceted cut... quite unique... could be the whole piece or individual stones, preference for the whole piece. Will you put out the word?... \n(LAUGHING) No, I'm consulting for the insurance company, isn't life strange? -- Love and kisses. He hangs up. His cheeriness vanishes. He coughs, more like a gag, and heads for the bathroom. \n108 INT. BATHROOM - DAY 108 \nVictor spits blood in the sink. Then, after catching his breath, squirts medicine down his throat with his inhaler, exits. \n109 INT.

HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe motorcycle cruises up the coast road. The surf glows with plankton. \nGABRIELLA presses her cheek against Jason's back. \n211 EXT. DOCK - NIGHT \nJason secures the motorcycle. He puts his arm around Gabriella, they walk down the dock to his boat. He helps her aboard. \nJASON \n(CALLING OUT) \nHENRY -- Henry emerges from the cabin. He eyes Gabriella. \nHENRY Oh, my. \n(CONTINUED) \n211 CONTINUED: \nJASON This is Gabriella. She's my contraband. She looks quickly at Jason, who smiles. Henry reaches out to shake her hand. \nHENRY Kid's a sucker for dark skin. \n212 INT. BOAT - NIGHT 212 \nGabriella and Jason tenderly make love in the swaying cabin. \n213 EXT. BOAT - NIGHT 213 \nOn watch, Henry finds his gaze sliding to the NOISY dockside BAR, its beer sign beacon-bright. The SOUNDS BELOW embarrass him. He makes up his mind. He swings off the boat and heads toward the bar. He doesn't notice Alex's Cadillac idling in the alley. The headlights click off, the motor goes silent. The BOATS CREAK against the slips. \n214 INT. BOAT - DAY 214 \nJason wakes up with a start. He senses something. He slides out from under the sleeping weight of Gabriella's arm and pulls on his jeans, reaches up to open the cabin hatch. \nHIS POV Alex's foot swinging. More of him comes INTO SIGHT as Jason climbs to deck. The financial pages open on his lap, he's drinking a Styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a donut; the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him. \nALEX Good morning! I brought donuts. Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the boat, his arms around his ribs. \nALEX Oh, it's not as bad as all that. \nJASON She fucking called you. \n(CONTINUED) \n214 CONTINUED: Alex shrugs. \nALEX She has some residual loyalty, yeah. \n(MODESTLY) Which I didn't expect either. Jason moves to the helm, switches on the engine. Alex quickly finishes his donut. He brushes off his fingers. \nALEX Where are we going? \nJASON I'm going fishing. Get off if you want. \nALEX No, it's a beautiful day for a boat ride. Give us a chance to talk. He makes himself comfortable. \nJASON Then make yourself useful and cast off the stern line. Alex moves to the stern while Jason casts off the bow line. \nALEX This one? \nJASON There's not a lot of choice. Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him. \nALEX -- If we could manage to ignore the personal history here, I think we could work something out between us. Jason turns the boat toward the open sea. \nALEX You want Gabriella? This is the way to have her. Life costs, Jason. Love costs. And you love her more than I do. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n214 CONTINUED: (2) \nALEX (CONT'D) (as Jason glances at \nHIM) So stake yourself to a life together.

She's staring out to sea. \nJASON \n(TO GABRIELLA) Alex wants to make me an offer. She gives no sign of having heard him. \nALEX We're giving you a hard choice, Gabby. Two rich men. Gabriella swivels her head slowly. \nGABRIELLA I don't want either one of you. A line quivers. Jason reels in a little. \n(CONTINUED) \n215 CONTINUED: \nJASON Something's going to bite, just \nABOUT -- (his biceps tightening) -- now. And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it. Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in a little, making the line taut, testing the weight. He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to the surface a big, dark green fish. _ \nALEX Jesus! What the hell is that? \nJASON Hammerhead. Young. Male. Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared. \nGABRIELLA Help him, Alex. \nALEX I'd just get in his way. His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared without either of them noticing. \n216 INT. CABIN - DAY 216 \nAlex is searching frantically. \nJASON (O.S.) No luck? Alex whirls around. His gun materializes in his hand.

He'll kill \nUSL Jason grabs her-and holds her with both arms to keep her from going any closer. Alex turns his head, puzzled, warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark continues to tear at him. \nALEX Help me, help.mel! Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges. forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The shark slowly changes color to a dull brown. \nALEX You knew it wasn't dead. Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries. \nJASON Mom didn't take the necklace. did. \n(CONTINUED) \n217 CONTINUED: 217 Alex struggles to stay conscious. \nALEX Then you killed her yourself. Jason slowly nods. \nJASON And you were in the car behind us. Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying slightly. \nGABRIELLA We were supposed to turn him ini I didn't think you were going to kill him! \nJASON Well, I didn't. Alex manages to laugh. \nALEX Jesus.

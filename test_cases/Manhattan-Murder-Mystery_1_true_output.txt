CAROL (with a disgusted tone in her voice) Ooh. 
TED Eh ? Come on. No, come on. Come on. You gotta get into it. 
CAROL Okay. 
TED Oh my God. Look, look, look, look, look ! 
The camera pans to the other corner of the street. Two people, a male and a female, are coming out of the brick building. CAROL (voice over) What ? What ? What ? What ? 
TED (yelling in voice over) Helen ! Helen ! (Back to a normal low voice) Duck, duck, duck ! 
Neither one of the couple has turned around at the sound of Ted's yelling, and they start walking down the street, away from the corner. 
CAROL (voice over) Ted! God, oh...Oh. 
TED (yelling in voice over) Helen ! 
The camera pans back to the car, looking through the open window on the passenger's side. Carol is hiding under the dashboard. Ted is hiding his face with his paper bag, holding a paper cup in the other hand. TED It's not her. 
CAROL It's not her ? 
She sits back in her seat. 
TED No, it's not her. 
Carol laughs. 
TED What... 
CAROL Oh, God, you really have this worked out, don't you ? 
She keeps on laughing. Ted starts laughing too. 
Slightly later. It is raining. It is still the same medium shot through the passenger's window, but the window is now closed, with the rain pouring on the window-pane. 
TED I figured she'd come out and go to work, you know ? 
CAROL Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's like... you and she has writers hours. 
TED I'm writing a play about something that happened to you and me. 
CAROL Oh, God. Oh, dear. What ? 
TED Remember-Remember that time... you and... you and I and Larry and Julie were all on that-that eating tour of France ? 
CAROL Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. 
TED And they, and then they wandered off and they forgot to pick us up ? You remember ? We had to share that bed-and- breakfast place. 
CAROL Right. Do you remember those wonderful cottages ? 
TED Yeah. 
CAROL And I remember... that we shared a bedroom together, right ? 
TED Yeah, but not a bed. 
The camera pans away from the car to the other corner of the street. Someone is coming out of the brick building. It is apparently a male wearing white pants. He opens an umbrella. 
CAROL (voice over) No, not a... Well, God. You were too gentlemanly to suggest that. 
TED Well, it's not... Not that I didn't think of it. 
The camera follows the man with white pants, while he is crossing the street on the other side of the street from the car. 
CAROL No. Well, I knew what was going on in your mind... because of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux, remember ? 
The camera is back behind the passenger's window of the car. Though the car-windows, we see the white-pants-man walking on the sidewalk on the other side of the street. Ted and Carol do not seem to notice him at all. 
TED It could have been our little secret, then you passed out. 
CAROL Well, you... Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago, doesn't it ? 
TED Not that long ago. 
Slightly later. The rain has stopped. Same shot through the passenger's window of the car, but the window is now open again. 
A long pause. Ted and Carol seem to be both lost them in their own thoughts. Then Ted gives a look outside and comes back to attention. 
TED Look, look, look, look. 
CAROL Oh, what ? 
The camera pans to the other side of the street. A woman is coming out of the brick building. 
TED (yelling in voice over) Helen ! (with a softer voice) Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck ! On the other side of the street, the woman has stopped and is looking around her. 
CAROL (voice over) Oh, god, yeah. Right. 
TED (voice over) She didn't see us. She didn't see us. 
CAROL (voice over) No ? No. That's gotta be her. 
TED (voice over) I'll bet it's... 
The woman starts walking again on the sidewalk. 
CAROL (voice over) Are you sure ? 
TED (voice over) I mean, she answered to Helen. 
CAROL (voice over) She answers to... She's pretty. 
TED (voice over) Yeah, I'll say. 
The woman has reached the corner of the street and she lifts her arm. CAROL (voice over) She's... What is she doing ? She's getting a... 
TED (voice over) She's getting a cab. A yellow cab stops near the woman. 
CAROL (voice over) Okay, okay. Hold on. 
TED (voice over) Keep-Keep down. 
CAROL (voice over) Okay, don't worry. Don't worry. 
TED (voice over) I'm gonna follow her. 
CAROL (voice over) All right. 
The woman opens the cab door and climbs into it. 
NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY 
Long shot of a street covered with a metal structure. We could be under a commuter train bridge. The yellow cab is driving toward us. The cab stops at the corner of the street with another street. The woman comes out of the cab, and walks away on the sidewalk of the other street. The camera pans back to the first street and we see Ted's car coming toward us. The camera stops at the corner of the street and Carol walks out of the car. She runs in the direction of Helen, and waves Ted to join her. The camera pans to the end of the street, which actually is a dead end street with the back door of a movie house. The woman enters the movie house. 
PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - INTERIOR DAY 
Medium shot of a door leading to an emergency stair way. Helen, the woman we just saw coming out of the yellow cab, is coming down the steps and through the door. She is blonde, young and pretty. 
PAUL (voice over) Watch your step. It's very steep. Be careful. 
Behind Helen, Paul is coming out of the stairway. Helen has stopped to look around her. 
HELEN Oh, this is beautiful. 
PAUL Isn't it ? 
HELEN Yeah. 
The camera pans away from the couple toward the main hall of the movie house. It is an old-fashioned movie house, with red velvet seats, and a carved balcony.

{"train": "INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nJINA, Jessica's mother, opens the front door and enters the living room wearing a grocery checkout clerk's uniform. Jina drops her old, worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway. She opens the bathroom door and enters. \nINT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nJessica is brushing her teeth when Jina enters. \nJINA Aren't you supposed to be watching Katie right now? \nJina reaches around Jessica and opens the medicine cabinet, grabs a bottle of ASPIRIN, and shuts it. Jessica continues brushing as if her mother were not there. \nJINA (CONT'D) Did you get my message? \nJessica shakes her head in the negative sense. Jina exits the bathroom and Jessica follows, still brushing her teeth. \nINT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nJessica walks over to the ANSWERING MACHINE and hits a button. The Answering Machine clicks on as Jessica brushes unenthusiastically. \nANSWERING MACHINE (electronic voice) You have one new message. (Jina's voice) Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say happy birthday, since you'll be gone when I get home. I'm driving your sister to school and I'm leaving the car for her, so I'll be taking the train back. \nJessica starts up as if she'd been struck. She spins around to an open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste \nto the concrete sidewalk below. Her mother's voice continues to pour forth from the Answering Machine. \nANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D) By the way, you should call your sister and stop this not-talking nonsense. \nJessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back towards the Answering Machine. \nANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D) Anyway, I know how you hate long messages, so I'll see you tomorrow... \nSuddenly wide awake, Jessica turns to her mother. \nJESSICA That's fucking bullshit. \nJINA Here we go again. \nJESSICA What about my car?! \nJINA Jessica, your sister got into beauty school, and she's going. Now I've got about two hours sleep before I have to drive her all the way the hell up there. \nJESSICA Yeah, I heard that. \nJINA Jess, you're still living here for free. \nJESSICA On the couch! \nJINA Jessica, it's still my car, and she needs it. Can't you be happy for your sister? \nJESSICA Oh yeah, I'm real happy. She gets my car, and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a favor and tell her how fucking happy I am for her. \nJINA If you're going to be like this, I'm just going to bed. \nJessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with water. \nJessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads \"Athens Youth Group\" in large letters along the front. Jina is gone. Jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it haphazardly. She grabs a pair of large SUNGLASSES off of the coffee table and places them over her eyes. \nShe opens the door and exits the apartment. \nEXT. RON'S GYM -- MORNING \nJimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT hatchback is parked in front of the small bare-bones gym. \nINT. RON'S GYM, LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nJimmy now dressed in worn-out heavily-frayed khaki shorts and a short-sleeve button down shirt with a \"Ron's Gym\" emblem on the pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with one hand while rotating steel CHINESE STRESS BALLS with his other hand. He opens the locker and pulls out a large brown LUNCH BAG propped prominently at the base. \nRON (O.S.) Hey Jimmy.   You fix the lat machine? \nRON, the tall, well-built, forty-something owner of the gym, approaches. Jimmy turns toward Ron. The row of lockers serves as a backdrop. \nJIMMY Yeah. \nRON Jimmy, I'm just gonna say this, alright? I gotta let you go. I can't afford two employees. \nJIMMY So you're keeping Melinda? \nRON Yeah. \nJIMMY Ron, that is totally fucked!   I been here way longer than her! \nRON Yeah, but I'm running a business. There're guys who pay me dues just 'cause she works here. \nJIMMY But she doesn't do anything! She just sits at the front desk all day. \nRON I know that. \nJIMMY Tell her to fix the fucking lat machine, she'll look at you cross-eyed. \nRON I can't afford two employees, and she attracts business. That's it. \nJIMMY Fucking great. Thanks. \nKATIE But it's okay to drink. \nJESSICA When you're older it'll be okay. \nKATIE How old are you? \nJESSICA Old enough. \nKATIE But you're not twenty-one yet. The law says you have to be twenty-one. \nJESSICA Katie, can you not ask so many questions today? I've got too much to think about. \nKATIE Cause it's your birthday? \nJESSICA Yes. \nKATIE Happy Birthday! \nJESSICA Thank you. \nJessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run, the weight of Katie bearing down on her. They reach their destination - a rickety old merry-go-round. Jessica turns her back to the merry-go-round, allowing Katie to step onto it. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) Hold on tight or you'll get hurt. \nKATIE I will. \nKatie grabs a handle as Jessica begins to spin the machine. Katie sails around happily as Jessica steps back to watch, Katie's youthful enthusiasm lulling Jessica into a nostalgic gloom. \nINT. AMBULANCE -- MORNING \nHEATHER is driving the AMBULANCE, sirens blaring, a CIGARETTE hanging out of her mouth, with ALLISON riding shotgun. HARRY, mild- mannered, rotund, middle-aged and slightly balding, is in the back sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance, adjacent to a stretcher. Harry sits expressionless, adjusting his spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving. \nALLISON (pointing) Turn left at the light. \nEXT. ROAD -- CONTINUOUS \nWIDE on the ambulance tearing through town, lights flashing. Heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation, recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to running through a red light. In the rear of the ambulance, Harry whips back and forth on the bench, yet remains calm, as if unaware of Heather's reckless driving. \nEXT. POOL, PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS \nWithin the parking lot, the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in front of a large picket fence encircling the pool. At the gate stands the LIFEGUARD. \nAll three climb out of the ambulance.    Harry rushes toward the Lifeguard. Heather takes a final puff    of her Cigarette and flicks it aside before continuing in the same   direction as Harry. Allison lags behind, pulling a BACKBOARD and a   large FIRST AID KIT out of the ambulance. \nLIFEGUARD She's in here. \nThey enter the gate. \nEXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUS \nHeather and Harry follow the Lifeguard into the pool area, where several BYSTANDERS have gathered around the VICTIM, BYSTANDER #1 and PETE among them. Heather gets to the Victim first, but stops short - she recognizes the Victim. Harry brushes past Heather. \nHARRY (to Bystanders) Can you give us some room, please? \nThe crowd backs up a bit, and Harry checks for vitals. \nHARRY (CONT'D) (looking up to Heather) She's breathing. \nHarry looks the Victim over a bit. \nHARRY (CONT'D) (to Lifeguard) What happened? \nLIFEGUARD I'm not sure. She just passed out, right where you see her. \nHARRY Did you see her eat anything? \nLIFEGUARD Uh-uh. \nHeather turns and walks back toward Allison coming through the gate carrying the Backboard and First Aid Kit - she wants a word with Allison. They talk in hushed tones. \nHEATHER I know her. \nALLISON Yeah?    How? \nAllison hands Heather the First Aid Kit as they move back toward Harry. \nHEATHER When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked him. \nALLISON How do you know? \nHEATHER She started dating Steve right after we broke up. I mean right after. I asked him if there was another girl, and he never answered. He couldn't answer, because he was fucking that slut. \nALLISON That doesn't mean they fucked. \nHeather gives Allison a disapproving look, as if to say \"don't be stupid, stupid.\" \nAs Heather and Allison approach the Victim, Harry looks up. \nHARRY Alright, she ain't comin' around. \nAllison lays the Backboard adjacent to the Victim, and the three place her on the Backboard. Heather is a bit rough. \nHARRY (CONT'D) (instinctively) Whoa, easy. \nCARLOS Jess, you just passed me!        In my car! \nCarlos continues to look as his Car makes a right turn and disappears from view. \nCARLOS (CONT'D) Jess, this is bullshit! Bring back my car! \nA horn honks, and Carlos steps toward the side of the road as a STATION WAGON passes right by him. He continues to stand in the street, although to the side. \nCARLOS (CONT'D) Jess, I know you're coming back here. I know you're not leaving me standing here. \nCarlos waits impatiently. Jessica pulls up in the Car and comes to a stop alongside him - she had gone around the block to pick him up. He gets in the passenger-side door. \nJESSICA Sorry. \nThe Car pulls away. \nINT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nCarlos has a look of disgust on his face. \nJESSICA I would have brought the car back, but I need it. \nCARLOS So you ask. \nJESSICA I said I'm sorry. \nCARLOS Yeah right. And why the hell are you still driving? \nJESSICA Fine. \nThe Car stops, Carlos and Jessica climb out of the Car and pass in back of it without a word. Carlos climbs into the driver seat, and Jessica the passenger seat. Jessica grabs Carlos's Nachos and starts munching them down, dipping each one into the CHEESE SAUCE that is on the side. \nCARLOS Where's the squirt? \nJESSICA At my place watching TV. \nCARLOS You left her alone? \nJESSICA Just for a minute. I left my novel at Aaron's. \nCARLOS You need it now? Aren't you supposed to be watching her? \nJESSICA Yeah, I'm stuck with her all weekend. I'm just gonna get through these last few weeks like I promised, and I'm done, I did a good thing, and some other moron can take a turn being her big sister. \nCARLOS Don't know why you wanted another sister when you hate the one you got. \nJessica needs to change the subject. \nJESSICA What're you up to? \nCARLOS Guess who stopped by. \nJESSICA Who? \nCARLOS Guess. \nJESSICA Mary Lynn. \nCARLOS Yes.     Gigantic beast of a woman that she is. \nJessica is obviously delighting in this. She enjoys Carlos fighting off the affections of this very unattractive girl. \nJESSICA Aw Carlos, I think you should give her a shot. She's probably one of those personality girls. \nCARLOS Yeah, what you know about personality? \nJESSICA I bet she'll give it up right away. \nCARLOS Now that's something you know about. \nJESSICA You should go for it.   Drain them pipes. \nCARLOS Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. \nCarlos reaches down and blasts the radio as the Car speeds down the road. \nEXT. PIZZA SHOP -- MORNING \nJimmy is carrying several full insulated pizza CARRYING BAGS, with several brown LUNCH BAGS full of food on top. Although the pile looks unwieldy, Jimmy has no trouble with it. He places the pile on the roof of his PIECE-OF-SHIT, opens the passenger door, and places the pile on the passenger seat. \nHe closes the door, and pulls a DELIVERY LIST out of his pocket to examine while walking around to the driver's side. Jimmy gets into the driver's seat and pulls out his CELL PHONE. \nJIMMY (into his cell phone) Hey, Car, it's me. I got a delivery in the area so I'm stopping by a little early. See you in a little while. \nJimmy hangs up, starts his Piece-of-Shit, and pulls out of the parking lot. \nEXT. COUNTY ROAD -- MORNING \nA POLICE CAR is sitting off the road, positioned to surprise unsuspecting speeders. The lone occupant, DEREK, twenty, about 6' tall with athletic build, in his police-officer uniform, is reading the SPORTS SECTION of a newspaper. \nINT. DEREK'S POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nOTS on Derek as he turns the page and continues reading the sports section. A young preppy high school PUNK speeds by in a CORVETTE - the RADAR GUN reads 93 m.p.h. As he passes, the punk looks straight at Derek, mouth open, clearly surprised by Derek's presence. Derek picks up his head and returns the stare of the surprised Punk as he passes. \nJessica throws the Nachos on the coffee table and sits on the couch, head in her hands, on the verge of tears. \nJESSICA Shit, shit... \nPITT Yeah, you did it. \nJESSICA Fuck you, Pitt. \nINT. POOL, MEN'S BATHROOM -- MORNING \nCOREY is MOPPING the floor. He glances up as Pedro steps over to him. Corey and Pedro talk and argue like two kids on a playground. \nPEDRO Hey, mehn. \nCOREY What're you doing back? \nPEDRO I got your sister. (forming breasts with his hands) She got big. \nCOREY That's my little sister. \nPEDRO She's hot, mehn. Esta buenisima. \nCOREY Just take her back to our place! \nPEDRO I can't because we got no place.   We got thrown out. \nCOREY He threw us out?! \nPEDRO Si! And all our shit's still in there! And Pancho, too! \nCOREY That's illegal, isn't it?!   He can't just lock us out! \nPEDRO Si, he sucks cock. I mean, I gotta go find a job, I smell like shit, I'm fucked! \nCOREY Maybe you should talk to your boss.    Like, ask him to take you back. \nPEDRO No, fuck him, mehn! Just gimme Mr. Cocksucker's address. \nCOREY What for? \nPEDRO I take care of this. \nCOREY Don't do anything that'll get us into trouble. \nPEDRO Do you think I'm stupid, mehn? Don't worry about this. I talk to him. But first I take care of business. \nPedro bangs on a stall door, with no response.    Pedro pushes the door to the stall open. \nPEDRO (CONT'D) Okay, mehn.     Good. Voy a cagar. \nPedro disappears behind the door of the stall.    Corey leans his Mop against the wall and exits. \nEXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- DAY \nJIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT into the driveway of what appears to be a one-story house, next to a RANGE ROVER. He climbs out with the strap of his BACKPACK hanging over one shoulder and walks around the house to the back yard. \nThe yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard, and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories. As Jimmy turns the corner, he spots a black CAT walking up to him. He grabs the Cat. \nINT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nWIDE on Jimmy holding the Cat behind a set of sliding glass doors, one door partially open. He enters and shuts the door behind him. Music is playing through stereo speakers, and a black-and-white movie is playing on the TV with the sound shut off. CAR, an Asian- American late-twenty-something, is sitting back on the couch facing \nthe TV. Magazines, junk food, remote controls and a CORDLESS PHONE are spread out on the coffee table. If Car notices Jimmy enter the room, he shows no sign of it. \nJIMMY Saw your cat outside. \nJimmy tosses the Cat on the floor, and it scurries off to another part of the house. Jimmy sits in a recliner beside the couch, glad to take a load off. Jimmy takes a peak at the TV. \nJIMMY (CONT'D) I gotta get back to work. I got more pies in the car. \nNo response. The Cordless Phone starts ringing.    Car remains perfectly still. \nJIMMY (CONT'D) Car? \nNo response.   The Cordless Phone continues to ring. \nJimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of Car. Nothing. Jimmy jumps up from his recliner. He stares at Car. He steps over, takes two fingers and checks Car's pulse. He stands back, unsure of what to do. \nHesitant, Jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a GYM BAG out into the room. He opens the Gym Bag and pulls out a large bag of MARIJUANA and a few jars of K. He throws them into his Backpack, zips up the Gym Bag, and puts it back into the closet. \nJimmy exits through the sliding glass doors. \nEXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nJimmy shuts the doors behind him. He stops in his tracks just outside the doors, thoughts running through his mind. \nINT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nWIDE on Jimmy through the doors as he about faces and stares into the house. He slides the doors open and re-enters. \nHe picks up the Gym Bag and carries it to the front of the couch. He sets down Gym Bag and drops to his knees, all while noticing that Car appears to be staring at him. He unloads the remaining contents of the Gym Bag into his Backpack, including a few bags of PILLS, a few more jars of K, and two large bags of WHITE POWDER. \nHe throws one strap of his Backpack over his shoulder and stands in front of Car. Jimmy stares at Car. \nJIMMY That's retarded. \nThe Female Passenger begins to slowly stir.    It is clear she is out of it - still very woozy. \nDAVE See?   I told ya. \nJIMMY Dave, you're a sick fuck.   I'm calling 911. Look at the blood! \nJimmy reaches for his Cell Phone, but Dave again objects. \nDAVE Put that shit away. I'll take her home and give her some K, she'll be fine. \nJIMMY She needs a doctor.   What the hell's K gonna do? \nDAVE Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine. A guy like you should be avoidin' that kinda' attention. \nJIMMY You should take better care of your girl. \nDAVE Bro, she ain't my girl. She plows through all my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam whore. She's a whore. \nFEMALE PASSENGER (O.S.) Fuck you, Dave, you asshole! \nDAVE See, she's fine. \nDave lights a CIGARETTE. \nJIMMY Holy shit. You're fucked up. (seeing an opportunity) Hey, you need any juice or anythin'? \nDAVE No, man, I'm good. \nJIMMY You sure? Look, man, I just got a buncha' stuff. Coke, e, K. I gotta sell it fast, you can sell it to your crackhead friends whenever. \nDAVE You been placin' bets with Bobby the Bookie again? \nJIMMY No. I'm just, I'm payin', like, twenty percent on my cards and shit, and it drives me fuckin' nuts, pissin' all my money away. \nDAVE Sellin' drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh? \nJIMMY You want it? \nDAVE Look, I'm definitely interested in a little bit for myself, definitely, but I ain't no dealer like you. Lemme think about it. \nJIMMY Hey, your nose is bleedin'. \nDave reflexively puts a finger to his nostril and examines it for blood. \nDAVE Seriously? \nJIMMY No, just horsin' around. \nDAVE Listen, I gotta get going.    Patch her head up and shit. \nJIMMY Yeah. (regarding Dave's Car) Sorry, man. \nDAVE Don't even sweat it, man, I told ya. \nJimmy and Dave get in their respective cars and drive off. \nEXT. POOL, SWINGS -- DAY \nEMILY is seated on a swing off to the side of the gated pool area, smoking a CIGARETTE, looking in through the gate at the pool. She's wearing an old, yet barely worn, BASEBALL CAP. \nCOREY (O.S.) You smoke?! \nEMILY Yeah, so?     You do drugs. \nCorey enters the frame, grabs the Cigarette and stomps it out, but Emily's nonchalant demeanor remains. \nCOREY How would you know? \nEMILY Everybody knows my brother does drugs. \nCOREY So you heard about that thing that happened? \nEMILY Yeah.   Everybody knows about that, too. \nCOREY If you think so highly of me, what the hell are you doing here? \nEMILY I'm just saying. Why'd you try to put everything back in the house? \nCOREY We ran outta of gas. We were right outside his house - what the hell else were we supposed to do? He wasn't supposed to be home for another hour. At least he took it easy on us. \nEMILY (changing the subject) Here, I brought this. \nEmily hands Corey the Baseball Cap.     Corey is caught off-guard. \nCOREY What for? \nEMILY Dad gave it to you, remember?     You left it. I brought it for you. \nCOREY Keep it.     I don't wear hats. \nEMILY I don't want it. \nHEATHER Five-thirty, and I'm not missing it. \nALLISON Derek probably thinks you're sleeping with your doctor. There's nothing wrong with you. \nHEATHER (holding the lower portion of her right ribcage) Ally, I have a pain right here that has nothing to do with my head. My dad died of heart disease, and if that asshole taught me anything, it's better to be paranoid than dead. \nA FEMALE POLICE OFFICER, a prim-and-proper plain-jane 5'5\" woman in her early twenties, exits the building and walks over to talk with the two Male Police Officers. \nHEATHER (CONT'D) That's her.   Tess. \nALLISON You're just guessing. \nHEATHER Ally, I know that's her.     That's his type, too. That little slut. \nBoth Heather's and Allison's BEEPERS go off.    They both look down at their Beepers and sit up in their seats. \nALLISON Harry's waiting. \nHEATHER Sorry if I snapped. \nALLISON You didn't snap. \nHEATHER I mean this morning. \nALLISON Oh.   That's okay. \nHeather starts the Ambulance and starts to pull out of the lot. \nHEATHER I'm just afraid its gonna be the whole thing all over again with Derek, and then I've got to find some other asshole, and do it all again. I'm sick of the whole cycle. \nALLISON So do something different. \nHEATHER I'm trying, but he's fucking it all up. \nAs they pull out of the lot, the two Male Police Officers head toward their Police Cars and the Female Police Officer heads back inside the station. \nINT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nJESSICA is on a PHONE, holding a bookmarked trash NOVEL in her hand. PITT is sitting on the couch watching TV. \nJESSICA Yeah, where are you? \nCARLOS' VOICE Right down the street, gettin' some more nachos. \nJESSICA Can you just come back and get me?     Hurry up. \nJessica looks up to see TROY entering the house with AARON behind him. TROY is a shaggy, 5'10\" pothead slacker in his late teens, wearing beat-up jeans, a t-shirt with a faded logo on it, and light hair above his lip and on his chin. AARON, a burly mutt, about the same age and only slightly shorter, wearing cut-off cargo pants with one of the thigh pockets ripped off, a sleeveless shirt and a tattoo on his left shoulder. Troy notices Jessica immediately. \nTROY Holy shit. \nJESSICA Aaron, I don't know how the hell you got... \nAARON (interrupting) Fucking bitch! \nAaron shoves Troy roughly out of the way as Jessica bolts out of the room. \nPITT (to Jessica) Use the back door, yo! \nJessica runs out the back door and around the front of the house. Aaron sees her turn the corner of the house, and he turns around to cut her off. \nAARON (to Pitt) Man, don't be helpin' that bitch! \nPITT I don't want to see you be hittin' no girl. Just calm your ass down. \nAARON Fuck you! \nAaron runs out the front door after Jessica. \nTROY He's gonna kill her. \nEXT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nAaron is out the front door, yelling at Jessica who is further down the street. \nAARON Where you goin', bitch?! \nJessica runs to Carlos's CAR, opens the door, throws the Novel in and jumps in after it. She throws on her seatbelt and rifles through her purse, looking for her pepper spray. \nJESSICA Drive! \nCARLOS (starting the Car) What's the deal? \nAaron, holding a ROCK slightly bigger than his fist, smashes the passenger-side window. \nCARLOS (CONT'D) What the fuck! \nJESSICA Fucking drive! \nAaron reaches in and grabs Jessica's hair and begins to rip her out of the car, cutting his own arm while doing so. Aaron growls, more in anger than pain, as he yanks with all his might. Jessica is holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand, and is scratching and clawing at Aaron to get Aaron to release her with her other hand. Jessica's seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping her in the car. Carlos is pulling away slowly. Aaron releases one hand from Jessica's hair and punches at the top of her head. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) Fuck you! \nAARON Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore! \nJIMMY No.     Nobody answered the door. \nKWON Well, you want to come by now? I'll be here. You can make your pick-up. \nJIMMY Can't do it now. I'm delivering on the other side of town. \nKWON Deliveries? Jimmy, fuck the pizza.     Stop by and get your shit. \nJIMMY I can't.   What's the big deal? \nJimmy, very anxious, runs a red light.    A CAR going the other way stops and honks. \nKWON Jimmy, my cousin's dead, and there's a shitload 'a shit missing from our house. \nJIMMY Car? \nKWON What do you think? \nJIMMY I don't know. \nThe TRAFFIC in front of Jimmy slows, and Jimmy coasts to a standstill at the tail of the traffic and in the middle of a busy intersection. \nKWON I want you to come over here and tell me everything that happened when you stopped by. \nJIMMY Nothing happened, Kwon.   I knocked and no one answered. \nKWON You didn't ring the doorbell? \nJimmy's light turns yellow while he is still at a standstill in the middle of the intersection. \nJIMMY That's what I meant. \nKWON And no one answered. \nJIMMY No.     No one answered. \nKWON You left a message on our house phone this morning. Why didn't you call our cells when you got here? \nJimmy's light turns red, and he is still at a standstill in the middle of the intersection. A CAR at the head of the cross traffic inches up to Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit and honks, but Jimmy does not seem to notice. \nJIMMY (stumped) Why didn't I call.     Good question. \nKWON What the fuck do I care, you think it's a good question?! Are you fucking kidding me?! \nJIMMY Look, I didn't think of it.    I got a lotta shit on my mind right now. \nKWON Jimmy, do you have my drugs? \nJIMMY No. \nThe cross traffic honking grows louder, even though there is nowhere for Jimmy to go. \nKWON Alright.     If you hear anything, you call me. \nJIMMY I will.     Sorry about Car. \nKWON Thanks, Jimmy. \nJimmy hangs up. \nEXT. INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS \nCars are still honking at Jimmy as he continues to sit at a standstill in the intersection. \nJIMMY (generally to the other drivers) Fuck off! \nJimmy throws his Piece-of-Shit in reverse, then cuts left, through and out of the intersection. \nEXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nJIMMY parallel parks his PIECE-OF-SHIT in front of his apartment and exits carrying his BACKPACK. He unlocks the door to his apartment, opens it, and steps one foot inside. \nINT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS \nJimmy slides the Backpack into his apartment. TIGHT on the backpack as it slides across the hardwood floor, straight towards the camera, to a halt immediately in front of the camera. Jimmy steps back outside and shuts the door. \nEXT. ROB'S HOUSE -- DAY \nCOREY is standing in the middle of an unkept lawn, watching ROB, about eighteen and wearing Corey's HELMET, ride Corey's MOPED in circles around him on the lawn. He's treating the Moped rather roughly, pulling wheelies and kicking the tail end out repeatedly. Corey is watching impatiently, holding the BASEBALL CAP at his side. \nRob jumps the Moped over the curb into the street, then turns up the driveway and pulls up alongside Corey. Rob removes the Helmet. \nROB I'll take it. \nINT. AARON'S HOUSE -- DAY \nAARON returns from the kitchen drinking from a can of SODA. TROY and PITT are on the couch, VIDEO GAME CONTROLLERS in their hands, waiting for the VIDEO GAME to load. Troy is lighting a CIGARETTE. \nAARON (to Troy) C'mon, let's go find her. \nTROY I'm not gonna go scouring the countryside lookin' fer her. \nAARON Gimme yer keys. \nJESSICA (not exactly confident) I can be more... persuasive in person. \nJessica punches another number into her Cell Phone. \nCARLOS (disappointed) Swell. \nKATIE'S VOICE Hello, this is Katie Kinney! \nJESSICA Katie, it's Jessica. \nKATIE'S VOICE Where are you? \nJESSICA Have you eaten? \nKATIE'S VOICE I'm starving! \nJESSICA Okay, I'm going to be home in a little bit, okay? \nKATIE'S VOICE Alright. \nJessica hangs up and throws her Cell Phone on top of the dashboard. \nJESSICA Drive. \nCarlos starts the Car. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- CONTINUOUS \nESTABLISHING SHOT on the Car pulling back out onto the street as Kwon continues talking to the Police Officer in the background. \nEXT. LANDLORD'S HOUSE -- DAY \nROB is riding his newly-acquired MOPED, with COREY on the back. Corey is holding Rob with one hand, his BASEBALL CAP with the other. He drops Corey off in front of Mr. Carson's house. \nAs Rob pulls a wheelie and exits the frame, Corey walks up to the front door of the house. He rings the doorbell, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a wad of BILLS as he waits. Mr. Carson opens the door. \nCOREY Hey Mr. Carson. I got the rent. \nMr. Carson opens the screen door, and Corey hands him the Bills. Mr. Carson begins counting them. \nCOREY (CONT'D) Can you let us back into our apartment now? \nMR. CARSON This is only one month.   You boys owe three. \nCOREY That's all we have. We'll give you the rest later, as soon as we can. \nMR. CARSON When you get me the rest, I'll let you back in. \nCOREY Mr. Carson, c'mon! This is just temporary. Pedro lost his job. \nMR. CARSON Bullshit. You're always late. You should spend less time trying to rob houses, and more time working. \nCOREY Aren't you supposed to take us to court before you throw us out? \nMRS. CARSON (O.S.) Holy fuck, Shelby! Shut the goddam door already you stupid bastard! You're letting the cold air out! \nMR. CARSON (suddenly in a hurry) Tell it to my lawyer. \nCOREY Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! We're doin' our best! We're gonna be homeless! \nMRS. CARSON (O.S.) Shut the goddam door! \nMR. CARSON Three months! \nMr. Carson slams the door. \nCOREY (banging on the door) C'mon! \nCorey stands and stares at the door a moment.   He turns and leaves, resigned to a long walk back to the pool. \nEXT. DINER, BACK-LOT -- DAY \nPEDRO is driving nonchalantly toward the back-lot.     A song is playing on the car radio. \nWIDE on a parked MUSTANG, a couple empty parking spaces on the passenger side of it. Pedro's TOW TRUCK backs up into the frame so that it's back end is almost touching the front end of the Mustang. \nPedro climbs out of his Tow Truck, leaving it on, and starts walking around to the back of it. Suddenly remembering, he doubles back and sticks his head in through the driver-side window, checking the gas gage. It's more than 3/4 full. \nSatisfied, Pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and hitches the Mustang to the back of it. An older couple pulls into the parking lot and parks one car length from the Mustang. OLDER MAN and OLDER WOMAN climb out of their CAR. The Older Man has taken an interest in what Pedro is doing. \nOLDER MAN Hey, can I park here? \nPEDRO (very friendly) Si, si, of course. (motioning toward the Mustang) The transmission is broke.   Transmissions on these cars suck. \nOlder Woman notices that the front passenger-side tire is flat. \nOLDER WOMAN (pointing) Oh, and the tire's flat, too. \nPedro steps around to the passenger side of the Mustang, surprised to see the FLAT TIRE. \nPEDRO Ah, si, but that's no big deal.   That's fine, believe me. \nOlder Man and Older Woman begin walking toward the entrance to the diner. \nJimmy is sitting in an alley behind the pizza shop, finishing a COKE with plenty of ice. Kwon emerges from the back door of the pizza shop. Jimmy sees Kwon, and hides his displeasure as best he can. \nKWON Hey, Jimmy. \nJIMMY What's up. \nKWON I'm just looking for my stuff.   Let's take a ride. \nJIMMY Where? \nKWON Your place. \nJIMMY Can't do it 'til after work. \nKWON You're sitting here on your ass! \nJIMMY I gotta eat. I'm going back to work now. My boss needs me - I'm the only delivery guy. \nKWON Is that your piece-of-shit out front? \nJIMMY Yeah. \nKWON Let's check that out. \nJIMMY I told you, I ain't got your shit. \nKWON Hey! Until I find the drugs, everyone is a suspect! \nJimmy's Cell Phone rings. \nKWON (CONT'D) (regarding the call) Fuck that. Let's look in your car. \nJimmy reaches into his pocket, but instead of a cell phone, he pulls out his car KEYS, which he tosses at Kwon. Kwon storms off, and Jimmy grabs his CELL PHONE out of his other pocket and answers it. \nJIMMY Hey, it's Jimmy. \nINT. DAVE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS \nDave is standing in front of finishing up blending a PROTEIN DRINK, holding a CORDLESS PHONE to his ear. Cut back and forth between Jimmy and Dave. \nDAVE Hey man, it's Dave.   I got happy news for you. \nJIMMY You want the juice? \nDAVE I told ya, I got plenty. But about the other stuff, I been thinkin' 'bout your problem, and I know a guy who could help you out. Buy a lot a' your shit all at once. \nJIMMY The juice? \nDAVE No, no. I'm talkin' 'bout the coke an' shit. I might know somebody. \nJIMMY (lowering his voice in case Kwon comes back) Who? \nDAVE This spear-chucker from Manville. Sold me some fake D-ball once. I tied his brother's dog to my front bumper and we talked it out. Turned out to be an okay guy. I gave him a call and he's definitely lookin'. \nJIMMY For how much? \nDave, having walked into the living room, takes a seat on the couch next to the FEMALE PASSENGER we saw earlier, her head now bandaged. She is snorting a line of COKE off of the coffee table. \nDAVE Well, he's pretty small time, but he's itchin' to move up a few notches. \nJIMMY He's got money? \nDAVE He talks so much shit it's hard to tell. You need to talk to him. \nJimmy considers, then pulls a PEN and his DELIVERY LIST out of his pocket. He turns the Delivery List over to write on the back. \nJIMMY Gimme his number, man. \nEXT. PIZZA SHOP -- CONTINUOUS \nThe doors of Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT are flung wide open.    Kwon is hauling Jimmy's spare TIRE out of the trunk. \nJIMMY Kwon, what the hell are you doing? \nKwon dumps the Tire on the ground and, seeing nowhere to hide anything, stands straight up and looks at Jimmy. \nKWON When you off work? \nJIMMY Don't know.     Maybe nine or nine-thirty. \nKwon tosses Jimmy his KEYS back, jumps in his BMW, and takes off. Jimmy becomes increasingly resolved as he watches him leave. Jimmy pulls out his Delivery List and his Cell Phone. He turns the Delivery List over to the number on the back and punches it into his Cell Phone. He paces as he talks. \nSINJIN'S VOICE Hello? \nJIMMY Is this Sinjin? \nSINJIN'S VOICE Yeah, who's this? \nJIMMY This is Jimmy. Juicehead Dave's friend. \nSINJIN'S VOICE Yeah, I know. \nEXT. POOL -- DAY \nHEATHER (busting Carter's chops with a mocking tone) What's up. \nAs Heather passes, Carter mockingly shows Heather the back of his hand as if to smack her. Heather and Allison pass, and Carter holds the door open with his foot as he looks for something to prop it open. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS \nFrom the inside we can see that Carter's house is the same house that Jerry moved out of this morning - Jerry was Carter's housemate. Heather and Allison walk in as if they know their way around. Carter spots a large clay LAWN DWARF on the back porch. He reaches for it. \nCARTER Stay outta my room. \nHeather holds out the vodka. \nHEATHER Wanna shot? \nCARTER Later.   I wanna see how crazy it gets. \nHEATHER Skirt. \nCarter props the screen door open with the Lawn Dwarf. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- EVENING \nPEDRO, EMILY and COREY, now wearing the BASEBALL CAP, are parked in the TOW TRUCK across the street from the front of Carter's house. Porno magazines lie on the dashboard and the floor. BERUBI, walking along the side of the house from the back yard, spots Pedro behind the wheel. He approaches. \nEMILY (to Corey, disapproving) I can't believe you're doing this. \nCOREY (aside to Pedro) Ya think it's a good idea we leave it out here on the street like this? \nPEDRO (aside to Corey) Forget about that, mehn. (referring to Berubi) \nI'll talk to Berubi. I know what to say to this guy. Don't worry. \nBERUBI Hey, Pedro, what's up with the Mustang? \nBerubi motions to the MUSTANG hitched to the back of it. \nPEDRO Que?    Ah, el Mustang? \nPedro starts to climb out of the Tow Truck. \nBERUBI Yeah. \nPEDRO Nada.    I'm doing a favor for a friend. \nBERUBI So you're driving around with his car hitched to your tow truck? \nPedro shuts the door to his Tow Truck and pulls up his shorts. \nPEDRO Bueno, he's a good friend. \nBERUBI Sounds good.    Come on an' grab a beer. \nPEDRO (to Berubi) Hey, listen, can I sleep on your couch? \nBERUBI Kimmock's got couch. \nPEDRO Come on, mehn, we're in trouble here.      We got thrown out of our home. \nBERUBI You got evicted? \nPEDRO Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk for my dog, I come back, my keys don't work, and the cocksucker put an eviction notice on the door. He didn't even tell us! Now my milk's spoiling in my truck, Pancho's probably pissing all over the place, I'm fucked. \nBERUBI Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in Jerry's room. He moved out. \nPEDRO He did? \nBERUBI Don't park there. Park in back. \nPEDRO Si, si.     No problem, mehn. \nBERUBI (to Corey) What's up, Becker. \nCorey sticks his hand up to say hello. \nINT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nCarlos's CAR is parked in street in front of Carter's house, just down the street from where Pedro has parked, but on the opposite side of the street and facing in the opposite direction. Through the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top, before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto the road. Carlos has noticed Pedro, but Jessica, silent as she stares at the house, has not. \nFinally, Carlos speaks up. \nCARLOS Did you know he was having a party? \nJessica grabs the rear view mirror and aims it toward herself.   She begins fixing her hair in the mirror. \nShe pulls her LIPSTICK out of her PURSE and begins to apply it as Carlos watches. She puts her Lipstick away and stares at Carter's house another moment. She checks to see that her SUNGLASSES are still hanging on the front of her shirt. \nJESSICA Let's go. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- CONTINUOUS \nJessica climbs out of the car and shuts the door. Carlos follows suit. They move around the side of the house toward the back porch. Jessica stops in her tracks and turns to face Carlos. \nJESSICA Wait here a second and let me talk to him. \nJESSICA Look, don't even get into the cheating thing, 'cause you're seein' Rachel still. Don't call me the slut. \nCARTER Look, I'm not gettin' into it with you. I'm through with that bullshit. \nJESSICA Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron. Just help me this one last time, that's it. \nCARTER He's probably gonna be here tonight, Aaron. \nJESSICA You're kidding. You barely even know who he is! \nCARTER No, but I know Troy real good. He said he'd be bringin' him. I ain't got nothin' against Aaron, so I said \"what the hell.\" \nJESSICA Look, can you just kick his ass for me? Please? \nCARTER Shit, Jess, I don't wanna be fightin' no friend 'a Troy's. Can't you just work this shit out? \nJESSICA Carter, he hit me! And sprayed me with pepper spray! \nCARTER What the hell. \nCarter contemplates, and Jessica realizes that the best thing to do is keep silent and let Carter's good side take over. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Look, if he tries anything tonight, I'll do something. \nJESSICA What'll you do? \nCARTER Whadda you mean what'll I do?! (facetious) I'm gonna dance with him! Fuckin' I'll beat his ass! I don't wanna, but if he shows up tonight and makes like he's gonna hit you, I'll beat his ass. \nJESSICA What if he doesn't come? \nCARTER Troy said he was bringin' him. If he doesn't, call him or somethin'. But I'm not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna chase Aaron across the goddam country. \nJessica is not completely satisfied, but Carter has decided what he's going to do, and that's that. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Alright? \nJESSICA Alright, fine. \nCARTER You're welcome. \nCarter exits, leaving the door open, but Jessica doesn't follow. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT \nJIMMY has parked his PIECE-OF-SHIT in the rear of the back yard behind all of the other CARS that have pulled in. He climbs out, slides his CHINESE STRESS BALLS into his pocket, and walks toward the house, his BACKPACK strapped over both shoulders like a schoolboy. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER \nJimmy steps through the open screen door into the kitchen. \nHEATHER (O.S.) Hey, there he is! Jimmy! \nHEATHER and ALLISON are playing CARDS at the kitchen table with a male PARTYGOER. They jump up from the table and approach Jimmy. \nJimmy pulls three small bags of MARIJUANA out of his BACKPACK. Allison pulls out some BILLS. \nJIMMY Thirty bucks. \nALLISON (counting Bills) I only got ten. \nJIMMY I don't believe this shit. \nALLISON (finishing counting) Nine. \nJIMMY You got nine! Jesus Christ!      You knew what you asked for! \nHEATHER Jimmy, relax. My God. \nJIMMY No, this is fuckin' ridiculous. What'd you call me for? I ain't runnin' a goddam soup kitchen here. \nHEATHER (mock seductive) Can't you just take care of us for tonight? \nJIMMY Yes, for thirty bucks. \nALLISON Here then, take nine for one. \nJIMMY It's ten. \nHEATHER You know what? You need to get laid, Jimmy. Maybe you'd relax a little. \nJIMMY Fine.     Enjoy your night. \nJimmy as he stuffs the Marijuana back in his Backpack and heads into the hallway. \nHEATHER Well I'm not going to drop to my knees for a lousy dimebag, so fuck him. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- NIGHT \nThe door is shut.    JESSICA is talking on her CELL PHONE. \nJESSICA (trying to muster a sweet voice) What are you doing? \nKATIE'S VOICE Watching TV. \nCARLOS Is he gonna help? \nJESSICA He said he would. \nCarlos pulls a pint of WHISKEY out of his back pocket. \nCARLOS Look.   Wanna shot? \nJessica accepts the Whiskey and takes a long pull. She holds onto the Whiskey without saying anything, and Carlos does not object. She begins to take in the sights and sounds of the party, and notices COREY leaning against a rusty old washing machine near the KEG as PEDRO hands him another BEER. \nJessica's POV as Corey spots her standing next to Carlos. He continues to stare at Jessica, clearly taken by the sight of her, his eyes locking onto hers. The desperation of their individual struggles is lost for a moment. \nPEDRO You want me to talk to her? \nThe moment quickly passes as Corey turns his attention back to Pedro. \nCOREY No. \nPEDRO Si. So let's go fix the tire on the Mustang. \nCorey attention is again drawn to the ping pong game, and Jessica takes note. \nCARLOS (to Jessica) You wanna play? \nCarlos motions toward the large kitchen window.   Jessica turns to look through it. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS \nJessica and Carlos are staring through the window at the CARD game taking place at the kitchen table. HEATHER and ALLISON are back at it with the male PARTYGOER they were playing with earlier, as well as CARD PLAYER, who has recently joined them. Heather is smoking a CIGARETTE. Card Player is dealing a round of asshole. All are visibly drunk. \nHEATHER (examining her Cards) What's dickhead doing? I knew he was lying. \nJessica turns toward the steps leading out onto the back yard, and Carlos follows. Heather and Card Player each place one card face- down on the table, exchanging one for the other. \nHEATHER (CONT'D) (to Card Player) This is your best card? \nCARD PLAYER I ain't happy about it. \nHEATHER Shut up and drink, asshole. (to Allison) I should call him. \nCard Player obeys and drinks. \nALLISON He said he'll be here. \nHEATHER He's probably got that Tess on all fours, fucking the shit out of her like the skank she is. (thinking about it) No, you're right, fuck him. (throwing three fours down on the table face- up) Drink. Fucking everyone drink. \nAll obey Heather. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nWe recognize the room as Jerry's old bedroom, empty except for a bed stripped of it's sheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, and a few posters and scraps of trash that have been left behind. JIMMY and RJ are looking across the room at SINJIN, a young African-American male about RJ's age, with an average build, sharply dressed in a button-down, and sport coat. Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his stylish threads. LOUIE, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap rests a BOWLING BALL BAG. Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy fondles his WATER BOTTLE nervously. He turns around to watch RJ closing the door behind them. \nLOUIE Sinjin! \nSinjin spins on the Pogo Stick and spots RJ and Jimmy standing at the entrance. Sinjin loses his balance and places a foot on the ground. He steps off the Pogo Stick and composes himself after his exhaustive venture. \nSINJIN Mr. Pizzaman! What's up? (referring to Jimmy's BACKPACK) Got any calzones in there? \nSinjin tosses the Pogo Stick aside. \nSINJIN (CONT'D) (re the Pogo Stick) It's harder than it looks. \nSinjin turns the GARBAGE CAN over and sits on it while motioning to the bed. \nSINJIN (CONT'D) (comfortably, to Jimmy) Sit down, man, sit down. \nRJ walks over to lock the door as Jimmy inches closer into the room. \nRJ Yo, door don't lock. \nSINJIN Well you got to stand your big muthafuckin' ass outside then, 'cause ain't nobody comin' in here. \nEverybody looks at RJ. \nRJ I don't give a shit. \nRJ steps out and shuts the door behind him. \nSINJIN Alright.     Jimmy, sit down, sit down. \nJimmy is clearly uncomfortable at the sight of these two. \nJIMMY I like to stand usually. \nSINJIN Alright. I'm Sinjin.      That legless waste is Louie. \nLOUIE I got legs little Massey muthafucka. \nJIMMY (to Sinjin) I thought it was gonna be just me an' you. \nSINJIN It is. Don't be worryin' Louie - he's just here to have a good time. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT \nHeather takes another hit of Vodka. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, SIDE YARD -- NIGHT \nJIMMY has his CELL PHONE to his ear, waiting for voicemail, anxious. \nJIMMY Bobby, where the hell are you? I gotta talk to you. Call me back right away. \nJimmy hangs up and takes a moment to think about his options. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT \nCOREY and BARNES are continue to play as PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES' GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS continue to watch. In the background, JESSICA paces back and forth as CARLOS sits on the ground indian-style watching the Partygoers on the back porch. Carlos takes a shot of WHISKEY. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT \nEMILY stands against the garage door, keeping to herself. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nALLISON has her head back on the couch as HEATHER lights a CIGARETTE. MITCH approaches the ladies with a BEER in his hand. Mitch is a staunch thirty-something mechanic with a beer-gut, dressed in Levis overalls, and wearing a backwards baseball cap and a beard that together hide much of his head. \nMITCH (primarily to Heather) Hey girls, what're you drinking? \nHEATHER Vodka. \nMITCH What're you mixing it with? \nHEATHER Vodka. \nMITCH Really? A little girl like you. You think I might get you to share a little of that? \nHEATHER I don't know. There's not much left. \nMITCH If you do something nice for me, I might do something nice for you. \nHEATHER I'm not that kind of girl. \nMITCH No? (regarding Allison) How about your friend here? \nALLISON Oh, now you want to talk to me? \nWhile Mitch is searching for an answer, a familiar voice cuts over the background noise. \nPEDRO (O.S.) Mitch!   There you are! \nPEDRO is approaching from the kitchen carrying a nearly-full BEER. Mitch seems a bit disappointed to see him. \nMITCH Hey. \nPEDRO We're outside by the woods. We got the Mustang, mehn. It's beautiful. \nMITCH Yeah, I'll be out in a minute. \nALLISON I feel nauseous. \nMITCH (to Heather and Allison, regarding Pedro) This is Pedro. We worked together 'til last week. \nPEDRO (to Mitch) Vamos, these girls aren't interested in you. \nMITCH (dumbfounded) Pedro... what the fuck... \nPEDRO Come on, mehn. Come check out the Mustang. \nPedro leaves and Mitch follows. \nALLISON Oh shit, I think I'm gonna be sick. \nAllison plops down on all fours, and begins vomiting violently. Heather kneels down next to Allison and pulls her hair back so it doesn't get hit by the vomit. \nHEATHER That's nasty. \nAllison has a few more convulsions. \nALLISON Fuck you. \nHEATHER Wanna wash your mouth out? \nAllison sits up, fixes her hair, then grabs the VODKA from Heather. Allison takes a mouthful, rinses, and spits. Allison then takes a drink. \nHEATHER (CONT'D) My God, Ally. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS \nPEDRO and MITCH make their way into the back yard towards the ping pong table. PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES' GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS are gathered around COREY and BARNES. Corey functions mechanically - his mind is not on the game. Barnes is openly frustrated as Corey finishes him off. \nBARNES One more. \nPING PONG PLAYER 2 (reaching for Barnes' RACKET) Let someone else play, Barnes. \nBARNES (to Ping Pong Player 2) You guys suck - he'll be at the table all night. \nPING PONG PLAYER 1 So let him beat someone else. \nDrunk Partygoer hangs up and turns over to a couple of other Partygoers. \nDRUNK PARTYGOER (CONT'D) (to Partygoers) Cops are comin'! I'm tellin' Carter. \nThe other Partygoers are not impressed - they continue to sit and drink. Drunk Partygoer loses focus and rejoins them. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT \nCOREY and MITCH barter over the Mustang, though Mitch seems more interested in his BEER than the car. PEDRO is putting the last touches on putting on the NEW TIRE. He picks the FLAT TIRE up and tosses it in the trunk. \nCOREY It's a good car. \nMITCH It's alright. I'd have to ask Jeremy. What do you want for it? \nCOREY Make an offer. \nMITCH Twelve hundred. \nCOREY Twelve hundred! That's nothing! \nMITCH Look, there's a lotta shit that Jeremy's gotta do with it. It's not like he can just switch the fuckin' plates and it's a go. \nPEDRO Co\u00f1o, we got thrown outta our apartment! We need more money! \nMITCH Steal some more cars.   I'll see what I can do. \nMitch polishes off his Beer and holds the empty cup up. \nMITCH (CONT'D) You want another? \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT \nAARON and TROY step out onto the back porch and spot JESSICA and CARLOS. Upon seeing them, Carlos stands straight up. \nCARLOS Aaron's here. \nJessica, still pacing, stops in her tracks and turns around beside Carlos. It's too late to gracefully exit, so Carlos stands there frozen. Jessica does not seem afraid. \nAaron and Troy approach.    It's clear Troy doesn't really want to be there. \nAARON (to Carlos) Hey guy. \nCARLOS Hey. \nAARON You like talking to my girl? \nCARLOS Aaron, I didn't mean nothin'. \nAARON No?     Just friends? \nCARLOS Yeah. \nAARON What's the matter, don't like her that way? \nCarlos painfully does not answer. Jessica, unfazed, takes another hit of WHISKEY. Jessica is confident because of the booze and because of Carter's promise. Jessica and Aaron begin arguing in calm \"I'm above this\" mannerisms. \nAARON (CONT'D) (to Carlos) Go 'head, take her home. Fuck 'er brains out. She'll give you a little surprise. \nCarlos simply stands there, ashamed of his inability to act. \nJESSICA Fuck you, I'm clean. You're the cheatin' asshole with bumps on your cock. \nAARON (to Troy) Hold this. \nAaron hands his beer to Troy and then grabs the Whiskey Jessica is holding. Jessica flinches as if afraid Aaron would hit her. \nAARON (CONT'D) Better wipe this off good. You never know. \nAaron uses his shirt to vigorously rub the mouth of the bottle before taking a long pull. The Whiskey is almost gone. Jessica grabs back the Whiskey, wipes it off as Aaron did, and polishes it off. \nAARON (CONT'D) You're good at that. You ready yet to go bang some dude? Maybe Carlos here? \nJESSICA Fuck you. I'm going to get Carter, and he's gonna kick your ass. \nAARON Carter ain't gonna kick shit. \nJESSICA We'll see, right? \nJessica moves to leave, but Aaron grabs her arm. \nAARON Hold on a minute ... \nJessica smashes the bottle over Aaron's head, knocking Aaron to the floor in a daze. \nJESSICA That's for the pepper spray, asshole! \nThe PARTYGOERS in the back yard are now fixed on Jessica and Aaron. CARTER runs over, holding his CIGAR and a BEER. BERUBI is behind Carter, eager for a fight. \nCARTER What's goin' on? \nTROY She smashed a whiskey bottle over his head. \nJESSICA He grabbed me! I'm not gonna sit and wait until he hits me again! He can just keep his fuckin' hands off me! \nHEATHER I don't mean it! You're my best friend! My sister! I love you so much! \nALLISON No, maybe you shouldn't.     Maybe I don't deserve it! \nHEATHER You deserve it! You're so perfect! \nALLISON Don't say that! I'm not, I'm not! \nHEATHER Yes you are! \nWIDE on Heather and Allison. The noise of the party drowns out their conversation. Allison is whispering forcefully into Heather's ear. Heather is listening, but cannot hear. We see her lips form the word \"what?\" Allison continues whispering, and Heather's face becomes furious. She pushes Allison back. \nHEATHER (CONT'D) You fucking slut! \nHeather shoves Allison hard off the couch. As Allison stumbles roughly and attempts to recover, PARTYGOERS, mostly guys, gather around, cheering wildly. Heather kicks furiously at Allison, who is on all fours employing the turtle defense. We catch a glimpse of Allison's face - she is in utter panic. Heather's foot catches Allison square in the face, knocking her limp. \nMost of the crowd has stopped cheering. Heather continues to kick at Allison's limp body, and two SKINNY GUYS pull Heather away. Heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is tending to Allison. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, HALLWAY -- MOMENT'S LATER \nHEATHER, visibly psychotic, and still very drunk, is making a beeline straight for RJ, who shows no sign of noticing Heather until she is directly in front of him. \nHEATHER (pointing to Berubi's bedroom) Wanna take me in there and fuck my brains out? \nRJ Sure, I don't give a shit. \nHEATHER Fucking great, let's go. \nHeather heads towards Berubi's bedroom, and RJ follows, passing JIMMY and BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES. Jimmy looks back at RJ as he passes. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nJimmy reenters the room he retreated from earlier, with Bobby in tow. The room is empty. \nBOBBY What the fuck Jimmy? \nJIMMY Just hold on. \nJimmy steps further into the room and stands pensive as Bobby takes a seat. Bobby lights up a CIGARETTE. \nBOBBY I can't figure you Jimmy. \nSINJIN (O.S.) Where the fuck is RJ? \nThe door bursts open again with a violent thrash, and LOUIE fires into view on his WHEELCHAIR with SINJIN pushing from behind. \nLOUIE Take it easy you stupid motherfucker! \nSinjin kicks the door shut with the back of his foot and wheels Louie into the room. Louie is holding a half-full bottle of JACK DANIELS in his hand, the BOWLING BALL BAG still in his lap. \nSINJIN This your partner? \nJIMMY Where you been? \nSINJIN Just gettin' a drink, Jimmy.     You took long enough. \nSinjin wheels Louie in a haphazard, indirect arc somehow closing on the center of the room. The doorknob rattles. \nSINJIN (CONT'D) (to Louie) Thought that shit didn't lock. \nSinjin is staring at the door, but Louie is pre-occuppied. \nLOUIE (to Bobby) You're Buggerin' Bobby Bales. \nBOBBY Excuse me you cripple motherfucker? \nLOUIE Buggerin' Bobby Bales.     Sayeed knows you. \nBOBBY Call me that again. \nLouie takes a strong pull from the bottle of Jack. \nSINJIN Louie, shut the fuck up.     Let's just do this. \nLOUIE Call you what again?     What everyone calls you? \nBOBBY Yeah.   Call me that. \nLOUIE Buggerin' Bobby Bales. \nBobby stands, tosses his Cigarette aside, and marches toward Louie. Sinjin knowingly looses his grip on the Wheelchair and steps back. \nSINJIN Bobby, let's relax now.   Louie may be a fool... \nBobby grabs Louie by the collar and throws him from the Wheelchair. Louis lands heavily on his crippled frame, dazed, the Bowling Ball Bag dribbling onto the floor near Sinjin. Bobby grabs the Wheelchair in both hands and begins smashing it against the wall and into the floor. \nAs Jimmy and Sinjin watch, dumbfounded, the large clay LAWN DWARF we saw earlier bursts trough the window and lands in the center of the room. Everyone stops to stare at the Lawn Dwarf, including Bobby. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT \nJESSICA storms through the yard toward Carlos' CAR.   CARLOS is right behind. \nJESSICA Where'd we park? \nJESSICA Thank you. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT \nEMILY, her back up against a tree, continues making out with an aggressive MALE PARTYGOER 1. As MALE PARTYGOER 1 comes up for air, we see that he has a hand down Emily's pants, fingering her. Emily's mind is somewhere else. \nEmily snaps back to reality and removes Male Partygoer 1's hand and pushes him away from her - she won't become another slut in a town full of them. \nMALE PARTYGOER 1 Hey, what's wrong? \nEmily makes for the front door and into the house. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT \nMITCH has refilled his BEER and patiently waits for a counteroffer from COREY. \nCOREY How about two thousand even? \nImpatient with the proceedings, PEDRO walks over to the passenger door of the Mustang, swings it open, and leans inside, struggling a bit. \nMITCH Can't do it. \nCOREY Why not? \nMITCH It's not economically... (searching for the word) Good, right, sound, whatever. \nPedro reappears from the backseat, holding an expensive STEREO. \nPEDRO Okay, give us two thousand and I give you this nice stereo for free. \nMITCH Where the hell you get that? \nCOREY Yeah, what the hell is that?! \nPEDRO (to Mitch) It was in the car. \nMITCH I don't want a stereo. \nPEDRO You can have it for free, mehn. \nMITCH Where's the speakers? \nPEDRO In the back. \nCorey walks over, opens the door and looks in the back.   His gaze falls upon an item on the floor in the back seat area. \nPEDRO (CONT'D) (O.S.) This stereo's a motherfucker, mehn, I'm telling you. I was gonna keep it myself. \nCorey pulls out from the back seat of the Mustang holding a large red and blue POLICE LIGHT. He is dumbfounded. Corey looks to Pedro for an explanation. \nPEDRO (CONT'D) What's that? \nCOREY I thought you'd tell me! \nMITCH It looks like police cherries. \nCOREY It can't be. \nMITCH Look fellas, I'd like to help you out, but I'm not into buying stolen cop cars. It don't seem right somehow. \nCorey and Pedro struggle for an explanation, but are left speechless. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT \nJESSICA and AARON are leaning against a random partygoer's CAR. They look very calm. \nJESSICA I didn't cheat. \nAARON Fine, you say so, fine. \nJESSICA That's it? \nAARON Well what the hell can I do? There's nothin'. I got your goddam initials tattoo'd next to my balls. \nJESSICA It was a stupid thing to do. \nAARON You don't like it?! \nJESSICA Well of course I like it!       But what if we break up? \nAARON Yeah, I thought about that.    I'll say it's for Jesus H. Christ. \nJESSICA Great. Then you could start going to church. \nTwo POLICE CARS pull onto the lawn to break up the party, both cars flashing their red and blue lights. TROY approaches Jessica and Aaron. \nTROY Cops're here. I'm goin'. \nAARON (to Jessica) You need a lift? \nJESSICA Okay. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS \nSINJIN Alright everybody calm the fuck down! This shit's gettin' outta hand- \nBANG! Everybody freezes as the sound and smoke of a gunshot lingers, then checks to make sure they weren't hit. As doorknob starts rattling with increasing intensity, everyone checks to make sure they weren't hit, then turns to the source of the gunshot. Louie is holding the Gun as he lays on his side, having scrambled to grab the Gun. \nThe door bursts open - it's RJ, out of breath. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS \nPOLICE OFFICER 1 is using one hand to hold onto PEDRO, still HANDCUFFED, by his upper arm, and the other hand to unlock and open the rear driver side door of his POLICE CAR. POLICE OFFICER 2 watches as he keeps hold of COREY by his HANDCUFFS. \nPOLICE OFFICER 2 (to Police Officer 1) Holy shit, you hear that? \nThe two officers hasten their actions. Police Officer 1 lowers Pedro into the Police Car, then moves to the front seat of the vehicle and grabs the C.B. \nPOLICE OFFICER 1 This is Unit one five seven. Shot fired at 15 Saddlebrook. Repeat, shot fired at 15 Saddlebrook. Request backup immediately. \nINT. POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nPolice Officer 2 shoves Corey into the POLICE CAR next to Pedro. Corey and Pedro sit in the rear of the police car, and Police Officer 2 slams the door. Through the windshield we see Police \nOfficer 2 run toward the house as he draws his PISTOL.   He moves up the porch past... \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- NIGHT \nDEREK walks up the steps onto the back porch as PARTYGOERS move out of the house away from the sound of the gunshot. He notices POLICE OFFICER 2 behind him. \nDEREK You call that in? \nPOLICE OFFICER 2 (moving up the porch and into the house) We should get everybody out of the house. \nHEATHER (O.S.) (friendly) Derek? \nDerek and Police Officer 2 turn to see HEATHER walking onto the back porch from the kitchen. \nDEREK Heather, go home. This is gonna get- \nHeather interrupts Derek's statement with a swift, unexpected knee to Derek's groin. Derek doubles over, and Heather grabs him by the hair. \nPOLICE OFFICER 2 Hey! \nPolice Officer 2 shoves Heather to the ground, grabs Derek's HANDCUFFS, and cuffs her hands behind her. Derek is still stunned from the assault. \nPOLICE OFFICER 2 (CONT'D) Derek, you alright? \nALLISON, who had been standing back watching the assault, approaches Heather, who is getting up onto her knees. Allison gets on her knees and hugs Heather, who cannot hug back because of the handcuffs. Allison is bawling. \nALLISON I'm so sorry, Heather, I'm so sorry. \nHeather is shutting her eyes extremely tightly, struggling not to cry. She does not attempt to pull away from Allison's tight embrace. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nSINJIN marches straight toward LOUIE, who wears the pathetic look of a child about to be disciplined. \nSINJIN Louie!   What the fuck are you shootin' at? \nLOUIE (pointing at BOBBY) Him! \nBOBBY You missed. \nSINJIN Gimme that motherfuckin' gun. \nSinjin grabs the GUN from Louie. KWON is sitting up, still dazed, holding a HANDKERCHIEF to stem the flow of blood streaming out of his nose. \nRJ Cops're here. \nSinjin turns to inspect the room, contemplating the situation.   He walks toward Jimmy's BACKPACK. \nRJ (CONT'D) We should go, Sinjin. \nSINJIN (facetious) I'm not sure about that, RJ! Let's break out the chalk board, some X's and O's, an' make fer certain! (taking command) Just toss Louie out the fuckin' window! \nKWON Sinjin, those are my drugs. \nSINJIN (holding out the Backpack) These are my drugs, (pointing at the BOWLING BALL BAG) That's your money. \nLOUIE (to RJ) Easy motherfucker! \nRJ drops Louie out the window like a sack of bird seed, Louie is followed by the remains of his wheelchair, then by RJ himself. Kwon stands up and grabs the bowling ball bag. \nKWON That's my gun, too. \nSINJIN (heading out the window after RJ) I'll send it UPS. \nSinjin disappears out the window.   Bobby is about to follow, but turns back toward Jimmy. \nBOBBY You owe me. \nBobby exits.   Kwon stands over Jimmy. \nKWON (foreboding) I'll see you around, Jimmy. \nJimmy watches as Kwon exits out the window. \n", "test1_input": "LITTLE ATHENS \nWritten by \nJeff Zuber & Tom Zuber \nDraft: 3/17/04 \nFADE IN: \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING \nThe room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t- shirt. He has not quite woken up yet. \nJerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER \nJerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nJerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the sink. \nHe catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and exits the bathroom. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III. He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it. \nHe turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen door slam shut behind him. \nTITLE CARD: \nLittle Athens \nEXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- MORNING \nThe old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job.   A faded sign reading \"ATHENS RESCUE SQUAD\" stands in front. \nHEATHER (O.S.) You hear about your ex? \nALLISON (O.S.) Jerry? \nINT. RESCUE SQUAD, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS \nThe kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON, both about nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with \"EMS\" stitched conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden table. Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9\" and built like a lingerie model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine. Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she has a lot on her mind. \nHEATHER Yeah, asshole Jerry. He's moving to Middletown. He left this morning. \nALLISON No way.   How do you know? \nHEATHER Carter said. He got some job at some company, giving his uncle hand-jobs. \nHaving put away the last of her food, Heather lights a CIGARETTE and stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the window. \nALLISON Doesn't sound so bad. \nHEATHER I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow. \nALLISON I don't want to go to a baseball game. You're going with Derek anyway. \nHEATHER Ally, I don't want to go either, but Derek told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by myself. \nALLISON I thought Adam was hurt. \nHEATHER I wish. \nHeather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out the window. \nEXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING \nBRAD, in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is standing in front of the door, waiting. MEGAN, in shorts, a t-shirt and a baseball cap, and AMY, in a sunskirt, look on. All in their late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept last night. \nBrad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. Brad walks over to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through the shades. Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's MAIL out of the mailbox that hangs next to the door. \nBRAD (banging on the window pane) Hey! Jimmy! \nThe door opens and JIMMY answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4\" and thin, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt and bedroom slippers. Jimmy's tired, but Brad's a friendly face. \nBRAD (CONT'D) Finally! \nJIMMY Office hours are nine to five. \nMEGAN You have a lot of credit card bills in there, Jimmy. \nJIMMY (holding his hand out for the Mail) I know. \nMegan hands Jimmy the Mail. \n", "test1_true": "JIMMY It's no big deal, but let's hurry up.    I gotta go to work. \nMEGAN (explaining to Amy) Jimmy's got like, six jobs. \nJimmy stands aside, allowing Megan and Amy into his apartment. Megan and Amy step inside, but Brad holds back. He needs to talk to Jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear. \nBRAD Hey Jimmy, hold up a sec. Look, not for nothin', but you know Buggerin' Bobby Bales is askin' about you? \nJIMMY Askin'?   Like how? \nBRAD Like how you owe him money on the Dallas fiasco, those chokin' motherfuckers, and you haven't been returnin' his calls. \nJIMMY How you hear this? \nBRAD Yesterday. I was puttin' a twenty-timer on Indiana for tonight, and he up and out- of-the-blue asks about you. Jimmy, man. Goddam. \nJIMMY (unconvincing) It ain't nothin'. He's just makin' conversation. \nBRAD It ain't nothin'? That faggot juicehead's gonna make a playground outta your asshole like he's back in the joint, and it ain't nothin'? And you heard all the stories I heard, about that horse-cock, and how he can't stop shootin' his mouth off about it too, like when he whipped it out at Tomlinson's party... \nJIMMY Alright Brad! Christ Jesus, I owe a little, shit, but I'll pay. Believe me, that guy wants his juice, his e, he comes to me. It's fine. \nBRAD Put some cash on Indy tonight, Jimmy. \nJIMMY Yeah. Alright, come inside and let's do this thing. I got work. \nBrad steps past Jimmy into the apartment, and Jimmy shuts the door after them. \nEXT. POOL -- MORNING \nThe slender white board extends majestically over the glistening blue water. PEDRO, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as if expecting an invitation. COREY, a late teenager covered with tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many pool skimmer drains. Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up, down, up, down. Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic. Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful. \nCOREY Nice. \nPEDRO Fuck you, conjo. This is my shower. \nCOREY Maybe back in Mexico that's a shower, in Athens that's just dirty. \nPEDRO Clean the pool, conjo, clean the pool. \nCOREY At least I'm paid to be here. \nPedro smiles as he paddles away from Corey, starting to enjoy his morning swim. A PAYPHONE hanging on the pool house starts ringing. Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone. In the background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly. \nCOREY (CONT'D) Wynwood Pool House, Corey speaking. \nEMILY, the voice on the other end, is hushed and uncertain. \nEMILY'S VOICE It's me. \nCOREY Emily? \nEMILY'S VOICE Some other girl would be calling you? \nCOREY How'd you get this number? \nEMILY'S VOICE Don't you work there? \nCOREY What do you want? \nEMILY'S VOICE I need you to come pick me up. \nCOREY Are you kidding? Where are you? \nEMILY'S VOICE At home. \nCOREY What for? \nEMILY'S VOICE Just because. I need to stay with you for a couple days. \nCOREY Emily, our place is tiny, we got no water. Our phone just got shut off, too. You'd be miserable like us. What for anyway? \nEMILY'S VOICE It's no big deal. Just come pick me up. \nCOREY Fine, forget it then. \nEMILY'S VOICE Corey, come on! How many times have I called you since you left? I wouldn't ask, except I don't have anywhere to go. Please. \nCOREY Fine. Alright, fine. If you wanna stay in our little dump, fine. \nEMILY'S VOICE Fine.   Thanks, then. \nINT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT -- MORNING \nJESSICA, about eighteen, wire-thin and plain, yet attractive in an unkept sort of way, with dirty-blond hair past her shoulders, lies on a couch sleeping. Her chokingly small living room is in a \ndevastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food containers flung in every direction. \nAn ALARM on a table next to the couch begins blaring, and Jessica stretches out her arm to silence it. \nINT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nJessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself, still half asleep. The bathroom is tiny like the living room - pathetic rather than endearing. She puts TOOTHPASTE on her TOOTHBRUSH. \n", "test1_id": 162, "test2_input": "Jimmy opens his trunk and pulls his BACKPACK out. \nJIMMY (CONT'D) Where's my Grand Theft Auto? \nMATT I lent it to Jerry. \nJIMMY What'd you do that for?

Pete approaches, looking for Corey. \nPETE Corey. \nCorey tries to phase out Pete's voice. \nPETE (CONT'D) The Blandinos just called again.   The broken glass is still there. \nROB'S VOICE (via the Payphone) Hello? \nPETE And the grass needs to be cut. \nCOREY (hurriedly to Pete) Okay, I'll take care of it. \nPETE (sarcastic) Don't forget to put gas in it. \nPete exits. \nCOREY Rob?     It's Corey Becker. \nROB'S VOICE Hey. \nCOREY You got any spare cash? \nEXT. POOL -- MOMENTS LATER \nEMILY is laying back in a lounge chair. Corey enters the pool area from clubhouse carrying the BASEBALL CAP. He walks over to his MOPED chained to the gate, throws on his Baseball Cap, unlocks his Moped, and pushes it through the gate where resident KIDS are gathered around a ping pong table. Emily watches as he hops on the Moped and throws on his HELMET. KID #1, one of the younger kids at the table, spot Corey in the distance. \nKID #1 Corey!

If he's drunk and having fun, and you just work it in on him real casual, he may slip. He'll never admit shit to me. \nALLISON He won't to me either. \nHEATHER Ally!   Just fucking try it! \nALLISON I don't wanna spy on him for you! \nHEATHER Ally, look, he's cheating on me, I know it in my heart, but I want him to admit it, alright? Before I fucking flush what's left of this shithole relationship down the toilet, I want him to admit it. \nALLISON Fine, I'll see. \nHEATHER Fine. \nEXT. PIZZA SHOP -- DAY \n", "test3_id": 164}

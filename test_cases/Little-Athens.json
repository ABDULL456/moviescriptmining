{"test1_input": "HEATHER Five-thirty, and I'm not missing it. \nALLISON Derek probably thinks you're sleeping with your doctor. There's nothing wrong with you. \nHEATHER (holding the lower portion of her right ribcage) Ally, I have a pain right here that has nothing to do with my head. My dad died of heart disease, and if that asshole taught me anything, it's better to be paranoid than dead. \nA FEMALE POLICE OFFICER, a prim-and-proper plain-jane 5'5\" woman in her early twenties, exits the building and walks over to talk with the two Male Police Officers. \nHEATHER (CONT'D) That's her.   Tess. \nALLISON You're just guessing. \nHEATHER Ally, I know that's her.     That's his type, too. That little slut. \nBoth Heather's and Allison's BEEPERS go off.    They both look down at their Beepers and sit up in their seats. \nALLISON Harry's waiting. \nHEATHER Sorry if I snapped. \nALLISON You didn't snap. \nHEATHER I mean this morning. \nALLISON Oh.   That's okay. \nHeather starts the Ambulance and starts to pull out of the lot. \nHEATHER I'm just afraid its gonna be the whole thing all over again with Derek, and then I've got to find some other asshole, and do it all again. I'm sick of the whole cycle. \nALLISON So do something different. \nHEATHER I'm trying, but he's fucking it all up. \nAs they pull out of the lot, the two Male Police Officers head toward their Police Cars and the Female Police Officer heads back inside the station. \nINT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nJESSICA is on a PHONE, holding a bookmarked trash NOVEL in her hand. PITT is sitting on the couch watching TV. \nJESSICA Yeah, where are you? \nCARLOS' VOICE Right down the street, gettin' some more nachos. \nJESSICA Can you just come back and get me?     Hurry up. \nJessica looks up to see TROY entering the house with AARON behind him. TROY is a shaggy, 5'10\" pothead slacker in his late teens, wearing beat-up jeans, a t-shirt with a faded logo on it, and light hair above his lip and on his chin. AARON, a burly mutt, about the same age and only slightly shorter, wearing cut-off cargo pants with one of the thigh pockets ripped off, a sleeveless shirt and a tattoo on his left shoulder. Troy notices Jessica immediately. \nTROY Holy shit. \nJESSICA Aaron, I don't know how the hell you got... \nAARON (interrupting) Fucking bitch! \nAaron shoves Troy roughly out of the way as Jessica bolts out of the room. \nPITT (to Jessica) Use the back door, yo! \nJessica runs out the back door and around the front of the house. Aaron sees her turn the corner of the house, and he turns around to cut her off. \nAARON (to Pitt) Man, don't be helpin' that bitch! \nPITT I don't want to see you be hittin' no girl. Just calm your ass down. \nAARON Fuck you! \nAaron runs out the front door after Jessica. \nTROY He's gonna kill her. \nEXT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nAaron is out the front door, yelling at Jessica who is further down the street. \nAARON Where you goin', bitch?! \nJessica runs to Carlos's CAR, opens the door, throws the Novel in and jumps in after it. She throws on her seatbelt and rifles through her purse, looking for her pepper spray. \nJESSICA Drive! \nCARLOS (starting the Car) What's the deal? \nAaron, holding a ROCK slightly bigger than his fist, smashes the passenger-side window. \nCARLOS (CONT'D) What the fuck! \nJESSICA Fucking drive! \nAaron reaches in and grabs Jessica's hair and begins to rip her out of the car, cutting his own arm while doing so. Aaron growls, more in anger than pain, as he yanks with all his might. Jessica is holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand, and is scratching and clawing at Aaron to get Aaron to release her with her other hand. Jessica's seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping her in the car. Carlos is pulling away slowly. Aaron releases one hand from Jessica's hair and punches at the top of her head. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) Fuck you! \nAARON Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore! \n", "test1_true": "AARON (CONT'D) You like that, bitch?! Huh?! \nCarlos swerves violently to the side towards a parked CAR along the side of the road. Aaron is plowed along toward the Car, but releases Jessica at the last possible second, just avoiding a collision with the Car. Carlos was not fooling around. \nAaron watches them tear down the street before he about-faces and walks briskly back toward the house, where Troy is standing on the front porch watching the action. \nINT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nJessica is still reeling from the pepper spray.   She can barely stammer out her words. \nJESSICA Oh my God, my fucking eyes! \nCARLOS Jesus, look at my car, Jess! \nJESSICA That fucking... asshole! \nCARLOS Now I'm screwed too. \nCarlos turns to look through the rear window of his car - all clear. \nJESSICA (practically sobbing) I'm so sorry. \nAn otherwise believable apology, except that Carlos knows Jessica too well. Jessica does not want to be in this alone. Carlos cuts the wheel to the right and tears down a side street. \nEXT. LANDLORD'S HOUSE -- DAY \nPedro pulls his TOW TRUCK and parallel parks on the street in front of the house. \nPedro gets out of his Tow Truck and walks up to the front door. He rings the doorbell. There is no answer, so he rings the doorbell again, then knocks on the door. Again no answer, so he bangs on the door vigorously. He leans over and peers inside the window. As he does so, MR. CARSON opens the front door, apparently having just woken up. \nMR. CARSON Pedro? What're you doing here?    Get the hell off my porch. \nPEDRO Hey, mehn, let me into my fucking apartment. \nMR. CARSON Either pay me or get off my porch. \nMr. Carson shuts the door. Pedro turns around and eyes the gray FORD TAURUS parked behind his Tow Truck. He walks back to his Tow Truck and grabs some tools. He begins hitching up the Ford Taurus to his Tow Truck. \nMr. Carson parts the curtain behind his front window, eyes wide as he watches Pedro. The front door opens, and Mr. Carson comes storming out. \nMR. CARSON (CONT'D) Pedro!   What the hell are you doing?! \nPEDRO I'm hitching up your car to my tow truck. \nMR. CARSON Let it down right now you psychotic sonuvabitch! \nPEDRO Let me in my fucking apartment, mehn! \nMR. CARSON Pay the damn rent! \nPEDRO I'm gonna pay, mehn!   I got fired! \nMR. CARSON Bullshit! You never pay rent, and I know you've had a job! I'm sicka' this shit! Put down my car, or I'm callin' the cops to haul your ass outta here! \nPEDRO Listen, don't be a cocksucker.   It's not needed. \nMR. CARSON I'm done with it. Let my car down. \nPEDRO I need a job, mehn, then I pay you. \nMR. CARSON Margaret wants you out of the house anyway. Now let my car down. \nPEDRO You need some balls, mehn!     Why do you let her slap you around?! \nMR. CARSON Nobody slaps nobody around. \nPEDRO Hay, por favor! I come by here to pay rent, I always hear her slapping your ass around. \nMR. CARSON I'm going inside to get the phone. If you're still here when I come back out I'm gonna dial the police with you standing right here next to me. \nMr. Carson proceeds inside. Pedro watches Mr. Carson proceed back into the house as he releases the Ford Taurus back down to the ground. \nEXT. BASEBALL FIELD, PARKING LOT-- DAY \nThe baseball field is empty. MATT is leaning against the driver- side door of his CAR, which is parked all by itself near a dumpster at the edge of the lot. JIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT up and parks next to the driver-side door of Matt's Car. \nJimmy climbs out of his Piece-of-Shit. \nMATT Dude, what the hell?! I'm ready to go here! Where the hell were you?! \nJIMMY I got into a freakin' accident! \nMatt starts walking to meet Jimmy at the rear of the cars. \nMATT Bullshit, man, fucking bullshit! You make me come all the way out here! I been waitin'! \nJIMMY Look, you're pissin' me off now! Remember who's doin' fuckin' who the favor! I got shit I gotta do! \nMatt pulls his WALLET out of his back pocket. \nMATT (about to blow, then controls himself) Fine, fine! Just give it to me. \nJIMMY I didn't want to bring my bag to your house, with your fuckin' parents home. \n", "test1_id": 162, "test2_input": "JESSICA (not exactly confident) I can be more... persuasive in person. \nJessica punches another number into her Cell Phone. \nCARLOS (disappointed) Swell. \nKATIE'S VOICE Hello, this is Katie Kinney! \nJESSICA Katie, it's Jessica. \nKATIE'S VOICE Where are you? \nJESSICA Have you eaten? \nKATIE'S VOICE I'm starving! \nJESSICA Okay, I'm going to be home in a little bit, okay? \nKATIE'S VOICE Alright. \nJessica hangs up and throws her Cell Phone on top of the dashboard. \nJESSICA Drive. \nCarlos starts the Car. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- CONTINUOUS \nESTABLISHING SHOT on the Car pulling back out onto the street as Kwon continues talking to the Police Officer in the background. \nEXT. LANDLORD'S HOUSE -- DAY \nROB is riding his newly-acquired MOPED, with COREY on the back. Corey is holding Rob with one hand, his BASEBALL CAP with the other. He drops Corey off in front of Mr. Carson's house. \nAs Rob pulls a wheelie and exits the frame, Corey walks up to the front door of the house. He rings the doorbell, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a wad of BILLS as he waits. Mr. Carson opens the door. \nCOREY Hey Mr. Carson. I got the rent. \nMr. Carson opens the screen door, and Corey hands him the Bills. Mr. Carson begins counting them. \nCOREY (CONT'D) Can you let us back into our apartment now? \nMR. CARSON This is only one month.   You boys owe three. \nCOREY That's all we have. We'll give you the rest later, as soon as we can. \nMR. CARSON When you get me the rest, I'll let you back in. \nCOREY Mr. Carson, c'mon! This is just temporary. Pedro lost his job. \nMR. CARSON Bullshit. You're always late. You should spend less time trying to rob houses, and more time working. \nCOREY Aren't you supposed to take us to court before you throw us out? \nMRS. CARSON (O.S.) Holy fuck, Shelby! Shut the goddam door already you stupid bastard! You're letting the cold air out! \nMR. CARSON (suddenly in a hurry) Tell it to my lawyer. \nCOREY Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! We're doin' our best! We're gonna be homeless! \nMRS. CARSON (O.S.) Shut the goddam door! \nMR. CARSON Three months! \nMr. Carson slams the door. \nCOREY (banging on the door) C'mon! \nCorey stands and stares at the door a moment.   He turns and leaves, resigned to a long walk back to the pool. \nEXT. DINER, BACK-LOT -- DAY \nPEDRO is driving nonchalantly toward the back-lot.     A song is playing on the car radio. \nWIDE on a parked MUSTANG, a couple empty parking spaces on the passenger side of it. Pedro's TOW TRUCK backs up into the frame so that it's back end is almost touching the front end of the Mustang. \nPedro climbs out of his Tow Truck, leaving it on, and starts walking around to the back of it. Suddenly remembering, he doubles back and sticks his head in through the driver-side window, checking the gas gage. It's more than 3/4 full. \nSatisfied, Pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and hitches the Mustang to the back of it. An older couple pulls into the parking lot and parks one car length from the Mustang. OLDER MAN and OLDER WOMAN climb out of their CAR. The Older Man has taken an interest in what Pedro is doing. \nOLDER MAN Hey, can I park here? \nPEDRO (very friendly) Si, si, of course. (motioning toward the Mustang) The transmission is broke.   Transmissions on these cars suck. \nOlder Woman notices that the front passenger-side tire is flat. \nOLDER WOMAN (pointing) Oh, and the tire's flat, too. \nPedro steps around to the passenger side of the Mustang, surprised to see the FLAT TIRE. \nPEDRO Ah, si, but that's no big deal.   That's fine, believe me. \nOlder Man and Older Woman begin walking toward the entrance to the diner. \n", "test2_true": "PEDRO Gracias! \nAs Older Man and Older Woman proceed toward the diner, Pedro opens the door to his Tow Truck, and reaches in to hit the control which lifts the Mustang. \nEXT. DINER -- MOMENTS LATER \nThrough the window we see PATRONS eating. Pedro drives by in his Tow Truck with the Mustang hitched to the back. \nINT. DR. COOK'S OFFICE, EXAMINING ROOM -- DAY \nHEATHER is sitting on the examining table, topless, holding her breath as DR. COOK runs a STETHOSCOPE on different areas of her back. Heather's BLOUSE and PURSE are lying on the examining table beside her. \nDR. COOK Breathe out. \nHeather lets her breath out. \nDR. COOK (CONT'D) It's official. You're as healthy as you were last week, and last week you were as healthy as an ox. \nHEATHER Are you sure you're using that thing right? I feel this ache (indicating her chest) Right here, like I'm being crushed between two boards. \nDR. COOK Nobody's crushing you.     Honest. I'm sure. It's all in your head.     I know a couple quacks... \nHEATHER I don't need a head doctor! \nDR. COOK I was just kidding there. \nHeather reaches into her PURSE and lights a CIGARETTE. Dr. Cook sighs - they've had a discussion about Heather's smoking before. \nDR. COOK (CONT'D) Heather, if you're going to insist on ignoring my rules, at least put your blouse on before you light up. \nHeather hops off the bench and makes a sudden about-face. She is gesturing wildly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she is half- naked. \nHEATHER Can't I be concerned about my health?!   Is that so outrageous?! \nDr. Cook is clearly uncomfortable conversing with Heather while her breasts are exposed. \nDR. COOK Heather... \nHEATHER I just don't want to be walking around tomorrow and drop dead because my heart collapses, and so that makes me weird or paranoid... \nDR. COOK Heather, there's nothing wrong with being concerned about your health. Please put your blouse back on. \nHeather grabs her Blouse from the table and puts it back on. \nDR. COOK (CONT'D) So I'll see you next week then. \nHEATHER (suddenly friendly again) Okay, yeah, see you next week. \nHeather leaves and shuts the door behind her. \nEXT. DEREK'S HOUSE -- DAY \nThe sound of panting can be heard. Two people are having sex. There are no words, although the girl regularly lets out high- pitched groans, indicative of at least a little pain. \nINT. DEREK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nLOW ANGLE MEDIUM on ALLISON bent over the bed, mouth agape. She buries her face in the mattress, revealing DEREK thrusting from behind. Derek climaxes. Allison pops up from below. \nALLISON I'm two pounds heavier I think. \nDerek lies back to put his head on the pillow. \nDEREK Sorry. \nAllison lies on top, nestling her head in his chest. \nALLISON It hurt. I knew it would hurt, but that was kinda worse than I thought. Does Heather... like it? \nDEREK She never let's me do it. \nALLISON She doesn't?    Why not? \nDEREK I don't know. She does shave though.    How come you don't shave? \nALLISON I don't know. I don't want to.     Do you love her? \nDEREK I don't know. \nALLISON How can you not know? \nDEREK She's got problems. \nALLISON I don't understand you. Why do you even cheat on her with me? She's so pretty. So much prettier than me. \nDEREK She's   a nutcase. I'll tell you what, I don't   know why you do it. You should have a man   of your own - we say it all the time,   me and Heather. \nALLISON Yeah, who? That slob you and Heather introduced me to last time? \nDEREK He outranks me. He's a good guy. \nALLISON Like me, I'm a good girl, and the best I can do is a guy that looks like that? \nDEREK No. \n", "test2_id": 163, "test3_input": "Heather takes another hit of Vodka. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, SIDE YARD -- NIGHT \nJIMMY has his CELL PHONE to his ear, waiting for voicemail, anxious. \nJIMMY Bobby, where the hell are you? I gotta talk to you. Call me back right away. \nJimmy hangs up and takes a moment to think about his options. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT \nCOREY and BARNES are continue to play as PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES' GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS continue to watch.

CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT \nEMILY stands against the garage door, keeping to herself. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nALLISON has her head back on the couch as HEATHER lights a CIGARETTE. MITCH approaches the ladies with a BEER in his hand. Mitch is a staunch thirty-something mechanic with a beer-gut, dressed in Levis overalls, and wearing a backwards baseball cap and a beard that together hide much of his head. \nMITCH (primarily to Heather) Hey girls, what're you drinking? \nHEATHER Vodka. \nMITCH What're you mixing it with? \nHEATHER Vodka. \nMITCH Really? A little girl like you. You think I might get you to share a little of that? \nHEATHER I don't know. There's not much left. \nMITCH If you do something nice for me, I might do something nice for you. \nHEATHER I'm not that kind of girl. \nMITCH No? (regarding Allison) How about your friend here? \nALLISON Oh, now you want to talk to me? \nWhile Mitch is searching for an answer, a familiar voice cuts over the background noise. \nPEDRO (O.S.) Mitch!   There you are! \nPEDRO is approaching from the kitchen carrying a nearly-full BEER. Mitch seems a bit disappointed to see him. \nMITCH Hey. \nPEDRO We're outside by the woods. We got the Mustang, mehn. It's beautiful. \nMITCH Yeah, I'll be out in a minute. \nALLISON I feel nauseous. \nMITCH (to Heather and Allison, regarding Pedro) This is Pedro. We worked together 'til last week. \nPEDRO (to Mitch) Vamos, these girls aren't interested in you. \nMITCH (dumbfounded) Pedro... what the fuck... \nPEDRO Come on, mehn. Come check out the Mustang. \nPedro leaves and Mitch follows. \nALLISON Oh shit, I think I'm gonna be sick. \nAllison plops down on all fours, and begins vomiting violently. Heather kneels down next to Allison and pulls her hair back so it doesn't get hit by the vomit. \nHEATHER That's nasty. \nAllison has a few more convulsions. \nALLISON Fuck you. \nHEATHER Wanna wash your mouth out? \nAllison sits up, fixes her hair, then grabs the VODKA from Heather. Allison takes a mouthful, rinses, and spits. Allison then takes a drink. \nHEATHER (CONT'D) My God, Ally. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS \nPEDRO and MITCH make their way into the back yard towards the ping pong table. PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES' GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS are gathered around COREY and BARNES. Corey functions mechanically - his mind is not on the game. Barnes is openly frustrated as Corey finishes him off. \nBARNES One more. \nPING PONG PLAYER 2 (reaching for Barnes' RACKET) Let someone else play, Barnes. \nBARNES (to Ping Pong Player 2) You guys suck - he'll be at the table all night. \nPING PONG PLAYER 1 So let him beat someone else. \n", "test3_true": "COREY You're Mitch? \nMITCH Nice ta meet ya. \nCOREY (tossing his RACKET to other side the table in front of Ping Pong Player Follow me. \nCorey heads toward the Mustang, and Pedro and Mitch follow. \nPING PONG PLAYER 2 (wanting to play Corey) Where you going Becker? \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, CARTER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nPARTYGOERS yell in unison at various events displayed on the screen. JIMMY is off to the side of the room talking to BOBBY. \nBOBBY You know I don't get involved with that shit. You sell your drugs and pay what you owe. \nJIMMY That's what I'm doing! Bob, just listen to me! I'm selling, but it's Sinjin. \nBOBBY Sayeed's little brother? \nJIMMY Yes. And Louie and RJ.     Fucking three guys. \nBOBBY One of 'em's a cripple.    Don't make such a big deal. \nJIMMY A cripple 'cause he got shot!     All I want you to do is just sit there! \nBOBBY Fuckin' sit there and what?     Pull my fuckin' cock... \nJIMMY (interrupting) And nothin'! Goddamit fuckin' Bob, I'll handle everything. Everything. You just sit your big fuckin' ass there, it'll be enough. They won't fuck with you, bein' in prison and shit. \nBOBBY Jimmy, I ain't in a mood to help you right now. I really ain't. You're wreckin' my livelihood. Soon no one pays me. And I fuckin' help you? You're a thorn in my balls. \nJIMMY Look Bobby, alright, I told 'em I had a partner, that's you. You're gonna help me now or you're not. And if you don't, I'm a little fucked. \nBOBBY What the hell's the matter with you? What the fuck is going on in your head? You comin' to me, knowin' I'm pissed at you, and what for. \nJimmy is losing it, his grip on reality.   He's drowning, grasping for anything that floats. \nJIMMY Jesus, Bobby, I'll owe you. Alright? I'll owe you. Just help me out here. Help me. \nEXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT \nEMILY is standing with her back to the garage door talking to MALE PARTYGOER 1, an average size boy about Corey's age. \nMALE PARTYGOER 1 How come I haven't seen you before?    Did you go to Athens? \nEMILY I still go there. I'm a freshman. \nMALE PARTYGOER 1 Really? I graduated last year.    You know anyone my year? \nEMILY My brother.   Corey.   Becker. \nMALE PARTYGOER 1 Oh yeah, I know Becker. He dropped out our senior year, though. He's your bro? \nEMILY Unfortunately. \nMALE PARTYGOER 1 Yeah, he's kind of a loser. \nEMILY (defending her brother) So what are you? \nChanging the subject, Male Partygoer 1 pulls a couple of white TABLETS out of his pocket. \nMALE PARTYGOER 1 Ever try this? \nEMILY Yeah... \nMale Partygoer 1 hands a Tablet to Emily, but she waits to see how Male Partygoer 1 take it, which he does by biting it in half and chasing it with his DRINK. Emily takes Male Partygoer 1's Drink and does the same. \nINT. DEREK'S POLICE CAR -- NIGHT \nDEREK is traveling on a busy road, with the sirens of his Police Car activated. CARS are pulling over to let him pass, but it is taking some time. He pulls out his CELL PHONE and punches in some numbers. \nINT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS \nThe room is crowded with PARTYGOERS. The CORDLESS PHONE is ringing, and DRUNK PARTYGOER answers it, clearly drunk. We cut back and forth between Derek and Drunk Partygoer. \nDRUNK PARTYGOER (yelling above the noise) Who is this?! \nDEREK A friend 'a Carter's. \nDRUNK PARTYGOER Oh, yeah, Carter! He's here!

He talks to Manolo but watches Manolo's wife, ANNA, 20's, a nice-looking, ostensibly demure young woman, as she moves around the kitchen. 
JAVIER Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert. 
MANOLO They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone. 
Manolo tenses, and throws open the window. 
MANOLO (yelling out the window) Away from the car.  Now! 
MANOLO'S POV out the window as KIDS play in the car, sitting behind the wheel. 
JAVIER Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them. 
ANNA He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime. 
MANOLO Shut your fucking mouth.  Nobody's talking to you. 
Anna sets a cup of coffee in front of Javi and stares at him. 
INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY 
Javi and Manolo cruise through the streets of Tijuana. 
JAVIER If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret. 
MANOLO She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone. 
JAVIER Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal. 
EXT. TIJUANA STREET - DAY 
Tourist hell.  A cacophony of street venders, panhandlers, and vehicular traffic.  Javier and Manolo are speaking with a flustered young American TOURIST COUPLE. 
TOURIST WOMAN You're a police officer.  Aren't you going to take a report or something? Don't you want to know what kind of car it is? 
TOURIST MAN It's a Brown Ford Explorer -- 
TOURIST WOMAN It was right here.  It's been stolen. I want to file a report. 
MANOLO Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car. 
JAVIER The police won't find your car. 
TOURIST WOMAN But you're the police. 
Javier pulls out a note pad and scribbles a number. 
JAVIER Call this man, he'll find your car for you. 
TOURIST MAN I don't get it -- 
TOURIST WOMAN How will this guy know who has our car? 
JAVIER The police will tell him. 
There's a beat of confusion. 
TOURIST MAN Why will they tell him but they won't tell us? 
TOURIST WOMAN (getting it) Because we pay him, stupid. (to Javier) Right?  And he pays the police. 
And then our car appears. 
JAVIER Yes.  Better than filling out forms, right? 
The man reaches in his wallet and offers Javier a twenty. Javi waves him off. 
Javier and Manolo walk back to their squad car when two SUV's come to a stop in front of them. 
Javier and Manolo exchange a look.  The doors SLAM and FOOTSTEPS approach. 
OFFICER (O.S.) Javier Rodriguez. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LA JOLLA GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB - DAY 
A ladies luncheon in the Nancy Reagan Dining Room overlooking a putting green.  The bejewelled WIVES of successful men yammer at one another around tables with rich flower centerpieces. 
SUPERTITLE: LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA, JUST OUTSIDE SAN DIEGO 
One wife, HELENA AYALA, 32, ex-model, with a sweetness and intelligence that almost contradicts her beauty, stares out the window at a small BOY, 5, using a putter as tall as he is.  Helena is six months pregnant and radiant. 
A waiter brings Helena's starter course.  Her friends, NAN DOBBS, early 40's, post Junior League, a little tipsy, 
STEWIE and ALEX, same League, watch her -- 
NAN Duck salad? 
HELENA Mmm. 
Nan can't believe it. 
NAN Helena, you never order duck salad. 
HELENA Well, that's true.  I don't. (re: her belly) I think someone else is asking for it. 
NAN Well, he's got good taste.  Isn't it the most wonderful thing you ever tasted?  I mean ever. 
HELENA It's delicious -- 
STEWIE They're the most marvelous little creatures.  Canard.  They fly, swim, walk.  And so cute with their babies marching along behind. 
NAN Looking for a nice sauce ala orange.

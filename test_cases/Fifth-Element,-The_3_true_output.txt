MUNRO (worried) What is it? 
Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro. 
KORBEN It's my wife. 
MUNRO I thought you were divorced. 
KORBEN I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please... 
He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's hands. 
KORBEN ...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back. 
MUNRO Three of us will never fit in there! 
KORBEN (pushing him) Oh, yes you will... 
Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again. 
KORBEN ...Coming! 
He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying about, shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his hair back and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between his eyes held by Cornelius. 
LEELOO Apipoulai! 
KORBEN I suppose that means "Hi" ? 
CORNELIUS I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston. 
KORBEN Is that the usual way priests go on vacation? 
CORNELIUS We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission.. 
KORBEN What kind of mission? 
CORNELIUS (sincere) We have to save the world. 
KORBEN (skeptical) Good luck.. 
CORNELIUS Of course. 
KORBEN Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks. 
Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen. 
KORBEN I'm sorry.. 
VOICE This is a police control action.. 
Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic voice. 
111	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING 
A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a flashing light-siren, a VOICE fills the air. 
VOICE This is not an exercise. This is a police control. 
Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge. 
CORNELIUS Oh my god oh my god.. 
Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower takes it's place. 
KORBEN Leeloo, hide in here and don't move! 
Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed. 
CORNELIUS What are you doing? 
KORBEN Trying to save your ass so you can save the world. 
..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall. 
Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt. 
112	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY 
Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues. 
VOICE ...Spread your legs and place your hands in the yellow circles, please. 
A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben's door which makes part of it transparent. 
COP 1 Put your hands in the yellow circles, please. 
Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's looking for a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair and beard. 
COP 1 (to COP 2) Sir? Are you a human? 
KORBEN No, I'm a meat popsicle. 
COP 3 (at the other end of the hall) I found him! 
C.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the neighbor's apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door. The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1 arrives with Korben's picture. 
COP 1 Sir, this is a control.  Please put your hands in the yellow circles.

SALLY AND PATIENCE are near the front of the line. Sally has transformed herself, with heavy make-up, a revealing skin-tight outfit that shows plenty of cleavage. Patience is in a conservative dress, one she might wear to work. Sally HOWLS with LAUGHTER at something Patience has just said. Patience looks grim. \nPATIENCE \nIt isn't funny. \nSALLY \n(still chuckling) Yes it is. All this time you've spent mooning over that hottie neighbor and he points a gun at you -- \nPATIENCE \nAt least it broke the ice -- \nSALLY \nI told you men go for trashy women. Patience rolls her eyes, looks over Sally's clothes. \nPATIENCE \nSpeaking of which -- how do you even stay in that outfit? \nSALLY \nWith any luck, I won't need to. \nPATIENCE \nI hardly recognize you. \nSALLY \nThat's the idea.

A TRENDY COUPLE -- call them RANDY and SANDY -- push their way past PATIENCE, almost knocking her over. Randy's ELBOW gets her in the gut, Sandy's SPIKE HEEL drives into her foot. \nPATIENCE \nOw! SANDY looks at her blankly as PATIENCE hops, injured. \nPATIENCE \nYou could say I'm sorry? \nRANDY \nOkay, you're sorry. He and Sandy laugh as the BOUNCER unhooks the rope, steps aside for them to enter. \nPATIENCE \nGod, people are so rude. \nSALLY \nYes! Sally has just gotten the NOD, hurries forward. Patience follows, limping a bit. The BOUNCER blocks Patience's path, looking her over from head to toe, disapproving. \nSALLY \nShe's with me. \nBOUNCER \nThen you can stay out here too. \nSALLY \nShe happens to be a very fine human being -- \nBOUNCER \n", "test1_true": "PATIENCE \nSally, just -- go in without me -- \nSALLY \nSee, you shoulda bought the dress.

Her eyes drift to an AD for AVENAL BEAUTY overhead -- LAUREL and GEORGES AVENAL, arms around each other. Patience sighs and stares out the window. \nEXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - NIGHT \nPATIENCE walks toward her building, the bus kiosk behind her, the BUS MOVING AWAY. The street is deserted at this hour. Patience feels very alone, until she looks up to see -- -- MIDNIGHT, perched in her window, awaiting her arrival. A smile appears on Patience's face. She quickens her step, crossing the empty street, almost to the sidewalk when -- -- AN ENGINE ROARS behind her.     Patience spins just as -- -- THE MERCEDES, LIGHTS OFF, barrels out of the darkness and \nWHAM!   Hits her full-on. MIDNIGHT at the WINDOW -- the cat lets out a HOWL. ANGLE DOWN, the MERCEDES has stopped, Patience lies a short distance behind... in bad shape. The PASSENGER DOOR OPENS. WITH PATIENCE, barely conscious. ANGEL approaches, studies her, turns her over with his foot. He nods, a job well done. \nINT.

A BODY (we don't get a good look) hits DARK WATER hard and vanishes below. MOVE UP TO REVEAL we're at a bridge over a river, CITY LIGHTS in the distance. ON THE ROADWAY, CAR DOORS CLOSE and the MERCEDES SEDAN SCREECHES away. CLOSER ON THE SKYLINE. A HOWL rises -- FIND MIDNIGHT, CRYING from a rooftop. Unseen CATS join in, a feline TELEGRAPH. \nEXT. EDNA'S HOME - NIGHT \nThe CAT CRY, just audible, far off. Then -- a CAT squeezes out a WINDOW at the gap in the sill... more CATS SCRAMBLE out dormers... yet MORE SHOOT OUT the flapping CAT DOOR. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT \nEDNA'S CATS scramble through alleyways, joined by STRAYS converging from all directions, picking up the CHORUS. It's like a flowing RIVER OF CATS. \nEXT.

LIGHTS of the CITY further away, the BRIDGE visible. CAMERA FINDS a nylon-encased FOOT... PAN OVER a woman's CORPSE, her clothes TORN, SOAKED and MUDDY, strewn with RIVER WEEDS. The body bobs amidst REEDS by this soggy shoreline. We reach the woman's FACE -- unnaturally pale, eyes fixed... it's PATIENCE PRICE. Dead. THE HOWLING is CLOSE now... THE CATS have gathered here, parting for MIDNIGHT, a feline VIP. The Mau steps tentatively out onto Patience's corpse, careful not to get too wet. She crouches on her chest, and -- CLOSE, BREATHES audibly into her parted lips. A brief, barely visible GLOW flickers at Patience's mouth. THE CAT shudders, then moves aside, BLINKS as if drugged. ANOTHER CAT climbs out onto Patience to take Midnight's place and perform the same ritual. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHIGH ANGLE.

CLOSE TO GROUND, FATSO the KITTEN dashes after a BELL BALL. POV, YOUNG PATIENCE at a mirror in a Halloween CAT COSTUME. POV, CLIMBING A TREE in a suburban backyard.    We see her MOM below, searching for young Patience. POV, TWO CLOSED COFFINS, surrounded by FLOWERS... now we hear \nYOUNG PATIENCE SOBBING. \nPOV, the BLACK MERCEDES ROCKETS AT CAMERA and -- \nEXT. MARSHLAND - NIGHT (PRESENT) \n-- PATIENCE sits up INTO FRAME with a SCREAM. She thrashes in the shallows of the marsh, gasping for air, disoriented... reborn. There's no sign of the cats. PATIENCE crawls onto shore amidst the reeds, slightly clumsy at first, almost like a newborn kitten. Her ragged, wet clothes cling to her body. TIGHT on her terrified expression. She has no idea what she's doing here -- or who, or what she is. She opens her mouth to speak -- all that comes out is a strangled CAT CRY. She works her jaw, but can't produce human speech. She darts her head, seems disoriented and overwhelmed. HER POV -- SOUNDS AMPLIFIED, IMAGE perhaps SOLARIZED, the darkness BRIGHTENED, objects of interest HIGHLIGHTED as she takes in the marshland. The EYES of any creature in sight GLOW. We'll call this CATVISION. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWHIP   PAN TO a nearby CRICKET perched on a blade of grass -- then   UP TO an OWL in the distance, soaring over the park. WHIP   DOWN TO its prey, a SCURRYING MOUSE. THE OWL swoops with   a SCREECH, nailing the MOUSE, we hear its SQUEAL. PATIENCE, frightened at first, becomes increasingly delighted by her heightened senses. She spots -- MIDNIGHT in the tall grass. The cat turns, looks over her shoulder once -- her EYES catch moonlight and GLOW. Patience is clearly meant to follow. PATIENCE follows MIDNIGHT on all fours, tenuously at first. But as she proceeds, her shoulders and hips roll in distinctly feline fashion. Her body seems slimmer, more muscular. She rises on two legs, moving in a slinky crouch. MIDNIGHT pauses to sharpen her claws on the bark of a gnarled old TREE. PATIENCE follows Midnight's lead, leans forward against the trunk, arms straight out, head arched back. She stretches her neck, her back -- her every movement is graceful, sensual, the awkwardness gone. She tries to pull her hands from the tree -- but can't for a moment, finding her FINGER-NAILS stuck into the bark (like a cat at a scratching post). A DOG BARKS -- without thinking about it, PATIENCE scrambles up the side of the tree like a streak. HER POV FROM TREE -- A LARGE DOG tugs on its OWNER'S leash, some distance away. The dog walker yanks the dog onward. PATIENCE takes this in, hears a MEOW -- MIDNIGHT is perched above her, very Cheshire Cat-like. PATIENCE looks around, self-conscious for a moment -- what is she doing up a tree? Bad idea to think. She loses her balance, clutching at branches, tumbles out of the tree -- IN MIDAIR for an instant, she flails spastically, letting out a SHRIEK -- then her body instinctively TWISTS and -- PATIENCE LANDS on all fours, one leg kicked out, haunches low. MIDNIGHT lands beside her, nods approvingly at her landing. Then the cat darts away again, Patience pursues. \nEXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT \nMIDNIGHT leaps to the top of a FENCE, staring down at Patience -- \"come on.\" Patience hesitates, then crouches and SPRINGS UP (with more than human ability), lands triumphantly on the fence -- then teeters and TUMBLES to the other side. MIDNIGHT looks disappointed. Patience jumps up again quickly, as if pretending this never happened, this time managing to hold her balance. MIDNIGHT gives her a look and leads onward. At first she's like a tightrope walker, careful of falling, but her steps become more confident. Soon she's moving as quickly and smoothly as the cat. MIDNIGHT leaps off the fence and darts across a road, PATIENCE follows. \nEXT. PUBLIC GARDEN/ZOO - NIGHT \nA tall wrought-iron FENCE surrounds greenery and distant cages in an urban area. A SIGN: \"ARBORETUM - ZOO.\" MIDNIGHT squeezes through a gap between the uprights. PATIENCE hesitates -- this is too narrow for a normal human. MIDNIGHT waits impatiently on the other side, tail twitching. PATIENCE makes a dubious SOUND, but manages to slip a foot -- then a leg -- into the opening, twisting and contorting. Amazingly, she's succeeding, her torso ripples and contracts as she insinuates herself between the bars. Finally only her head is on the wrong side. With a final TUG, she's through. MIDNIGHT crouches low, stalking. PATIENCE copies the behavior. MIDNIGHT slowly approaches -- A MOTH, fluttering near a FLOWER in this botanical garden. MIDNIGHT sneaks up close, then POUNCES, but the MOTH flies out of the cat's grasp. \nPATIENCE GIGGLES, MIDNIGHT turns on her and HISSES. The woman and the cat roll together in this neat BOTANICAL GARDEN, playing and batting at each other. CAMERA MOVES TO a small sign nearby, which labels this planting as \"CATNIP.\" MIDNIGHT HURTLES a CONCRETE MOAT, PATIENCE follows, still high, giggly. She suddenly finds herself face to face with: A BENGAL TIGER.   He lets out a small ROAR. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE blinks, crouches -- and ROARS back, unafraid. The tiger springs forward... and LICKS HER. She wrestles with him playfully, he's just a bigger version of Midnight. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. EDNA'S HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING \nEDNA POWERS sleeps in bed. MIDNIGHT climbs atop her, starts kneading. She makes a NOISE, rolls over, opens her eyes. \nEDNA \nMidnight?   What are you doing here? She squints, sees morning light through a window.    She climbs out of bed in her nightdress. \nEXT. EDNA'S HOME - DAY \nEDNA emerges in a bathrobe, crossing her overgrown lawn, MIDNIGHT bounding ahead of her.

PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPATIENCE'S SLEEPING FACE.     She stirs, stretches. WIDER, she's lying on top of a BOOKCASE in a twisted, awkward position. MIDNIGHT jumps up and brushes against her. CLOSE ON PATIENCE'S EYES -- they FLY OPEN, GOLD-FLECKED and (for a moment) ELLIPTICAL. PATIENCE -- now pure CATWOMAN -- springs down gracefully and scans the dark apartment. She stretches her limbs languorously, licks her lips. She flexes her fingers, watching appreciatively as her CLAWS EMERGE. She reaches out and SPEARS LONE'S CARD on a fingernail, regards it as she picks up the receiver. With another CLAW she unhesitatingly punches in the number. When she speaks, after a beat, her voice is throaty, sexier -- whenever she's Catwoman, she'll talk this way. During the following, she toys with the long PHONE CORD like a cat. \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \n(on phone) Mmm, too bad you're not there... guess I'll have to go out and play by myself. She tosses the receiver aside and prowls the room, moving casually atop the back of the couch, from there to other pieces of furniture and the counter, hops down to the floor. She studies the place as if seeing it for the first time. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \nWhat a dump. PATIENCE plucks at the clothing she wears, frowning. She opens a DRESSER DRAWER and PAWS through the contents, like a cat digging in a litterbox, SHREDDING the clothes. \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \nUgh -- please -- frowsy -- She moves to a closet, throws open the door, rifling through the outfits, RIPPING them to bits, hurling them aside. \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \nDamn, I haven't got a thing to wear!

All eyes turn toward an approaching FIGURE whom we don't see at first... LOW ANGLE -- a sleek pair of black patent leather BOOTS appears. A purring rendition of a familiar children's tune: \nCATWOMAN \nAnd the cat came back, the very next day... MOVE UP SLOWLY to reveal the rest of the ensemble -- long legs in BLACK TIGHTS, the short SKIRT and bodice TOP of the dress. A WHIP is wrapped around her waist, the tip dangles almost like a tail. Her stride is confident, sexy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATWOMAN \nThe cat came back, they thought she was a goner... Her arms are encased in long, satiny BLACK GLOVES. A half MASK with eyeholes and subtle cat's ears covers the top half of her face, her hair falls free like a mane behind. \nCATWOMAN \nBut the cat came back, she just wouldn't stay awa- a-ay... CATWOMAN -- the former PATIENCE PRICE -- comes to a stop in front of the slack-jawed BOUNCER. \nCATWOMAN \nWhat's the word I'm looking for?   Oh yes... Meow. So saying, she strokes a finger under the bouncer's chin -- CLOSE, the CLAW emerges from a SLIT in the glove's fingertip, but doesn't draw blood. THE BOUNCER recovers himself, unhooking the rope and stepping aside. Catwoman strides past him into the club. \nINT. TRENDY CLUB - NIGHT \nDramatic DECOR, throbbing MUSIC, DANCING TRENDIES. CATWOMAN moves confidently through the club. PATRONS can't help but stare, getting out of her path as she crosses the room. RANDY and SANDY, the rude couple, are bellied up to the bar. CATWOMAN slithers between them, almost unnoticed at first. RANDY starts as something FLICKS against his back -- CATWOMAN holds the end of her WHIP/TAIL, smacking it lightly against his rear end. He looks up at her. \nCATWOMAN \nBuy me a drink. SANDY stares daggers at Catwoman with her drooling boyfriend, but Catwoman ignores her, leaning close to the attentive BARTENDER and almost whispering: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATWOMAN \nWhite Russian, no ice, hold the vodka and Kahlua. The man blinks, retreats to fill the order. SANDY taps Catwoman on the shoulder as she makes eyes at Randy. \nSANDY \nExcuse me.     Excuse me, earth to slut -- he's taken. Without looking at her, Catwoman COUGHS discreetly into her hand, then drops something in SANDY'S martini glass \n-- SPLASH. \nCLOSE -- a FURBALL in the woman's drink. SANDY backs away, making a horrified noise. \nSANDY \nEuw! The bartender produces a SHOT-GLASS full of cream. \nBARTENDER \nCream, straight up. Catwoman knocks this back, licks white residue from her lips. \nCATWOMAN \nLet's dance. She grabs RANDY by the lapel and drags him toward the dance floor -- not that he needs a lot of encouragement. CATWOMAN shoves the man onto the dance floor ahead of her. She begins to writhe sensuously to the music, instantly the center of attention. Catwoman's distinctive movements combine catlike grace with acrobatics and martial arts. \nRANDY does his best to keep up.         He moves near, puts his hands on her ass. She hisses: \nCATWOMAN \nDon't touch my tail. CATWOMAN pulls her WHIP from around her waist, FLICKS it in the air -- Randy backs off. But Catwoman swings the whip so that the braided leather wraps repeatedly around his torso. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe pulls him against her, clutches his butt -- then PUSHES HIM AWAY, spinning him out on the whip like a top -- his TROUSERS have been SHREDDED, the belt SLICED. His pants drop to his ankles, he stumbles back in his loud bikini underwear, losing his balance and falling. THE CROWD reacts, laughter. \nBOUNCER \nThat's enough for one night, honey. HE LUNGES at her from behind, but she drops down and slithers out of his grasp -- it's like she's vanished into thin air -- then CATWOMAN rises behind him, plants a foot in his ass -- -- and boots him into the DJ'S STATION -- CRASH!   MUSIC \nSTOPS. \nMORE CLUB GOONS appear from the back, approach angrily. \nCATWOMAN \nGuess the party's over. CATWOMAN springs upward, atop a BANK OF SPEAKERS. She moves with incredible agility, near the roof of the club, from the speakers to a LIGHT RIG -- she leaps and grabs a MIRROR BALL, which SWINGS and deposits her close to the door. \nEXT. TRENDY CLUB - NIGHT \nCATWOMAN hurls open the front doors, kicks aside the velvet rope. She addresses the impatient CROWD: \nCATWOMAN \nC'mon in, wanna-bes! Free drinks! THE CROWD stampedes the door. Catwoman struts away down the sidewalk, recoiling the whip around her waist. \nA couple of CLUB GOONS make it past the throng. CATWOMAN, moving onto a highway OVERPASS, notes she's being pursued.

LONE sways, losing his balance, she springs and grabs his gun arm, saving him.

She bounds away, comfortable on the narrow railings. Lone pursues, moving more carefully now. Accompanied by the ballet music, the two perform their private dance, high above the TOMBSTONES and GRAVES. CATWOMAN winds up in a corner on a MESH PLATFORM, no way out from here, but for a 25-foot drop to -- THE FLOOR, where POLICE await, pointing upward. LONE advances, he has her trapped.     He pulls HANDCUFFS. \nCATWOMAN \nHandcuffs.   Yummy. He lunges at her -- she dodges, kicks a leg out from under him. No slouch at fighting, Lone recovers, plants a kick in her mid-section. She gasps, surprised. \nCATWOMAN \nYou play rough. \nLONE \nThis isn't a game. He charges at her, but she parries a blow, lands a SLASH across his shoulder. As he comes at her again, she jumps and grabs an overhead ELECTRICAL cable, swinging away -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLone has too much momentum, he loses balance, about to go over the edge -- CATWOMAN swings back like a pendulum, wrapping her legs around his neck, saving him from falling. She swings him back over the platform, tries to kick him off, but he grabs her legs, pulling her and SNAPPING THE CABLE -- STAGE LIGHTS go out, ELECTRICAL SPARKS fly as they hit the platform together, she lands straddling him, catching the SPARKING CABLE just before it strikes the mesh. \nLONE \nBe careful!   That thing hits the metal, we're both fried! CATWOMAN leans close, whispers: \nCATWOMAN \nI knew there was a spark between us. She turns and flings the cable away, it dangles free of the mesh floor, still spitting SPARKS. A second later, CLICK -- LONE has slapped a handcuff on her wrist, CLICKS the other cuff over his own. CATWOMAN spins back on him, looking hurt. He reaches to pull off her mask. She slaps his hand. \nCATWOMAN \nPlease, it's our first date. I wouldn't want the mystery to go out of our relationship. LONE struggles to push her off, but she keeps her thighs locked around him. He finally rolls on top of her. \nLONE \nWe don't have a relationship. \nCATWOMAN \n(mock sadness) You men love the chase, but once you catch us, you always lose interest.

From the ground, CATWOMAN plants a kick in his back from behind, he falls forward and SLAMS his FACE HARD into a LIGHT RIG. Catwoman winces, sounding a lot like Patience: \nCATWOMAN \nSorry. She's on her feet, ready to scamper off, but -- MORE COPS have made it to the grid, blocking every way down - \nANGLE DOWN, COPS have covered every exit below. LONE glares up at her. \nLONE \nIt's over. \nCATWOMAN \nAnd here I thought we were hitting it off... With that, she leaps and grabs the dangling POWER LINE which TEARS LOOSE from the ceiling -- She DROPS to the floor, still holding the CABLE.

She lifts her own hand daintily, then violently SWINGS THE POWER CABLE into the CIRCUIT BREAKERS -- \nA FLASH, a BANG, a SHOWER OF SPARKS -- then -- PITCH DARKNESS.

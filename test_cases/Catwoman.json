{"train": "Cats see things we don't.   Our secret selves -- our souls. \nPATIENCE \nMm.   Do you have any Band-Aids? \nCUT TO: \nINT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCAMERA MOVES THROUGH this modest, neat studio apartment, PAST a BULLETIN BOARD with numerous PHOTOS. One or two show a YOUNG PATIENCE, there's a picture of a LITTLE GIRL between TWO SMILING PARENTS on a ROLLER COASTER. Mostly, though, they're snapshots of a chubby TABBY CAT, from kitten hood to old age. Suddenly, MIDNIGHT LUNGES INTO FRAME, attacking a picture of FATSO, ripping it from the bulletin board. KEEP MOVING PAST WINDOWS facing on the street and an adjacent BUILDING across an alley -- it's a corner apartment on the second floor. CAMERA HOLDS ON A TV, where a classic OLD MOVIE like Now, Voyager plays. At a key, romantic moment, \nCUT TO COMMERCIAL -- \nLAUREL AVENAL strides TOWARD CAMERA -- statuesque, perfect, a supermodel. We hear the VOICE of GEORGES AVENAL: \nGEORGES (V.O.) \nYou know who you are. You know what you're after. A MALE MODEL steps INTO FRAME, reaches for her -- \nGEORGES (V.O.) \nYou know you're too good for any man... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLaurel raises an eyebrow haughtily and SLAPS his face.     She moves past the male model to -- -- GEORGES AVENAL. He's Laurel's husband and the company C.E.O., handsome and charismatic. LAUREL falls into his arms. He caresses her, deeply in love. Georges WINKS. \nGEORGES \n... almost. CUT TO a PRODUCT SHOT of a JAR OF CREAM, the name \"BEAUNIQUE\" and the AVENAL LOGO. \nGEORGES (V.O.) \nBeaunique by Avenal. You know you want it. CLOSE ON LAUREL as she tosses her hair back, Gilda-style, with a seductive pout. She purses her lips in a kiss. REVERSE ANGLE -- PATIENCE watches with a curled lip, on the couch in a T-shirt and shorts, EATING CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM directly from a pint carton, a dark smear around her mouth. Suddenly, MIDNIGHT POUNCES at the SPOON OF ICE CREAM. Patience jerks back, startled, raises the spoon out of reach. \nPATIENCE \nNo -- this is mine! MIDNIGHT doesn't back off, jumping repeatedly at the spoon, climbing over Patience, getting a rear PAW in the open pint. \nPATIENCE \nOh, gross, you -- just take it. Patience offers the cat the half-empty pint. As MIDNIGHT digs in happily, burying his head in the container -- \nLIGHTS COME ON in the apartment across the way. PATIENCE hesitates only an instant, sticks the spoon in her mouth, CLICKS OFF the TV and flips off a LAMP by the sofa. THROUGH THE WINDOW, A HANDSOME MAN -- his name is TOM LONE -- crosses past. PATIENCE sighs in the dark, moving for a better view.      This voyeurism is a guilty habit. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLONE checks his mail, loosens his tie, unbuttons his shirt. \nPATIENCE \nWelcome home, sweetie. How was work today...? (male voice) Same old same old. All I wanna do is get out of this shirt and give you a big old hug... LONE is distracted, reading his mail, shirt still on. MIDNIGHT, meanwhile, pulls her head out of the ice cream and leaps onto the windowsill -- she looks first at Lone, then at Patience, who looks around her. \nPATIENCE \nDown in front... Come on, you, off with the shirt. Instead, LONE is moving out of view.    PATIENCE moves in the same direction, into her BATHROOM. \nINT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nTHE BATHROOM WINDOW faces into Lone's bedroom. He starts to unbutton his shirt, glances casually out the window -- PATIENCE immediately ducks out of sight.     A moment later, she rises slowly to peek out again -- THE WINDOW is DARK, LONE has turned off THE LIGHT. PATIENCE flips ON THE LIGHT, studies her face in the mirror. \nPATIENCE \nLame, lame, lame. She wipes a bit of chocolate from the corner of her mouth. She tries a seductive pout, a la Laurel, gives her hair a seductive toss -- it winds up in her eyes and mouth. ON PATIENCE'S WINDOW -- from across the alley, we see PATIENCE before her mirror, brushing her hair. PULL BACK to reveal we're watching with TOM LONE, who spies on Patience through his own window, lights off. He SIGHS. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AVENAL HQ - SHOWROOM - DAY \nMOVING CAMERA delivers an assault on the senses: MIRRORS, oversized versions of the BEAUTY PRODUCTS, charts of COLOR CHOICES, shelves upon shelves of slickly-packaged COSMETICS. Prominent is a DISPLAY for BEAUNIQUE. HIP MUSIC in BG. AVENAL GIRLS, perfectly coiffed and made-up Barbie dolls, busily paint the faces of CLIENTS, women of all ages and backgrounds, in high-tech MAKE-UP CHAIRS that resemble torture devices. PATIENCE crosses through, pausing to take off her sneakers and pull on a pair of high heels. SALLY -- an Avenal girl in a prim outfit, working on a matronly CUSTOMER -- looks up to greet PATIENCE. We now see Patience has a small SCRATCH on her cheek, poorly covered with makeup. \nSALLY \nLook what the cat dragged in. \nPATIENCE \n(touching her cheek) I know, I know, I'm late -- Midnight thought there was a mouse in my pillow. \nSALLY \nThis is why I only sleep with my own species. Lunch at Joey's? PATIENCE nods and waves as she hurries through a set of doors to an ELEVATOR BANK. \nINT. AVENAL HQ - ACCOUNTING BULLPEN - DAY \nOVERHEAD ANGLE on a rat's maze of office cubicles, peopled with ACCOUNTING STAFF. FIND PATIENCE tapping at her terminal, sipping COFFEE. It's a grim little space, enlivened by a GARFIELD toy, some New Yorker cartoons. PATIENCE seems bored by the drone work -- then she cocks her head at something on the screen, leans closer. She double- checks DATA in the print-outs. Something doesn't tally. ON SCREEN -- among a long list of figures, we see \"YP-3\" highlighted, followed by a series of numbers. PATIENCE gets up quickly with the printouts, she spills a few drops of COFFEE on her white blouse. She dabs at these distractedly as she moves through the bullpen toward a glassed-in office. She knocks on the open door, where we see the name \"D. BERGER - ACCOUNTING.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \nDave, I was just going over the first quarter expenses. Our lab fees for this one additive -- YP-3 -- have gone through the roof. BERGER, a balding, bespectacled accountant, looks up as Patience moves around his desk to show him some figures. \nPATIENCE \nLook at this, an overage of eight hundred percent on \"extruded pellets\" alone -- I'm not even sure what that is -- \nYou can afford some peroxide, can't you?    Do something about this mousy hair. GEORGES runs a hand distastefully through her frizzy hair, then takes a moment to study her. \nGEORGES \nStain on your blouse, run in your pantyhose -- and that color's awful on you. (fingering her outfit) Do you own an iron? Show me your hands. Shaking, Patience extends her hands. Georges inspects her trembling fingers. He seems saddened, clucks his tongue. \nGEORGES \nA nail-biter... my my, you really are the \"before\" picture, aren't you? \nLAUREL \nI could give her the number for my manicurist -- \nGEORGES \n(waving Laurel off) What's your name? \nPATIENCE \nPatience... \nGEORGES \nI haven't got all day -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \nNo, my name's Patience, Patience Price.   I'm in accounting. \nGEORGES \nI'm afraid that's no excuse. Regardless of your position, you do represent Avenal Beauty. I simply can't allow that to continue. \nPATIENCE \nWait.   You're not -- firing me? \nGEORGES \nI have no choice. All we have to sell is an image -- and you are not it. You've got to go. DING! The DOOR OPENS. Patience stares at the man in disbelief, then bolts out into the SHOWROOM. STAY WITH GEORGES, LAUREL and ANGEL as the doors close. \nLAUREL \nPoor girl. GEORGES studies Laurel's face a moment, leans closer, amazed. \nGEORGES \nIs that a pimple? \nINT. JOEY'S DINER - DAY \nA retro place, PATIENCE and SALLY sit in a booth over SALADS and SODAS. Sally leans across the table, fixing Patience's make-up -- her mascara's run from crying, her nose is red. An open MAKE-UP POUCH rests between them. \nPATIENCE \nI try, Sally, I really do. I read Vogue, I wear uncomfortable shoes... I've been a female all my life, you'd think I'd be better at it by now. \nSALLY \nWatch the frown lines, you'll need a lift before you're forty. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \nHe's right, I'm not even presentable enough to be an accountant. Maybe the church needs a new bell- ringer. \nSALLY \nLook, he was just in a bad mood.   Sales are down, his marriage is on the rocks -- \nPATIENCE \nHow do you know that? \nSALLY \nI have an enquiring mind. This is \"Nympho,\" very hot, I snagged it from the showroom... She opens a tube of LIPSTICK, starts applying it expertly to Patience's lips as she speaks. \nSALLY \nLaurel's losing her looks, she's dumber than her cockapoo -- buzz is, Georges is trading her in for next year's model. All I'm saying is, by now he's probably forgotten about canning you. \nPATIENCE \nI don't care.    No way am I going back there. \nSALLY \nShut up, you'll smear... voila, now suck your finger. Patience puts her finger in her mouth, pulls it out with a pop, to keep the lipstick off her teeth. She studies the residue on her finger. \nPATIENCE \nI can't believe we put this stuff on our mouths. Grease, acid and ground-up fish scales... who knows what they put in our mascara... \nSALLY \nGEORGES \nImpossible, this has to be an error.     Are you responsible for this data? \nBERGER \nWell, actually Patience Price brought the matter to my attention -- \nGEORGES \nYes, yes, I'm familiar with Ms. Price. Obviously her bookkeeping is as sloppy as her appearance. \nBERGER \nSir, she's a very reliable employee -- \nGEORGES \nI've heard enough, Berger. In the future, double- check your figures before you waste my time -- and then put it in a memo. \nWITH BERGER \nBERGER \n(on phone) In all fairness, Mr. Avenal, I think -- \nBEEP. He's talking to a dial tone.      Berger hangs up, frustrated and chagrined. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY \nSTART on a JEWELRY DISPLAY, a ritzy DIAMOND NECKLACE. SALLY's face appears in the window, beaming. \nSALLY \nWow... sorry, Patience, I just found a new best friend. PATIENCE, beside her, WHISTLES appreciatively, then moves on. \nPATIENCE \nI'm sick of drooling over things I'll never have. The two are WINDOW-SHOPPING, passing a SHOE STORE, boots and high-heels... A WESTERNWEAR SHOP, belt buckles, WHIPS... \nSALLY \nOh, you're a ray of sunshine. Tell you what, let me take you clubbing this weekend -- \nPATIENCE \nI'm not sure I'm fit to be seen in public. \nSALLY \nYou will be in that dress.   I've had my eye on it for weeks. SALLY points at a MANNEQUIN in the window of a trendy boutique, garbed in a dramatic, sexy outfit -- a short bodice, a tiny skirt, plenty of plastic skin showing. \nPATIENCE \nSally, that is not a dress, it's a rumor of a dress. It's barely forensic evidence of a dress. \nSALLY \nIt's a genuine Gaultier knock-off -- \nPATIENCE \nIt's not me. \nSALLY \nBut don't you ever wanna be somebody else? \nPATIENCE \nI just wish I could be ten years old again -- it didn't matter what I wore as long as I could climb a tree in it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSALLY \nYour tomboy days are over. \nPATIENCE \nThat's my bus, Sal, see you later. PATIENCE trots toward a BUS, SALLY calls after her. \nSALLY \nThis weekend, Patience. I swear, I'm gonna make you have fun if it kills you... As Sally moves on, CAMERA LINGERS ON the window of A LINGERIE STORE, scantily-clad MANNEQUINS, including one in BLACK UNDIES and a CAT MASK. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nDAVE BERGER, the accountant, dressed casually, gets out of a CAB and heads into his modest home. \nINT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nBerger SNIFFS the air quizzically as he lets himself in. He moves toward the KITCHEN. In the kitchen DOORWAY, he fumbles for a LIGHT SWITCH, flicks it on and -- \nEXT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nKA-BOOM!     The WINDOWS BLOW OUT with a HUGE EXPLOSION. ACROSS THE STREET, a BLACK MERCEDES pulls from the curb, HEADLIGHTS OFF, and ACCELERATES away. \nLONE \nDon't mention it. I can't resist a damsel in distress. PATIENCE smiles and cocks her head... flirtatious body language. She runs a hand through her hair, pulls out some sticky TISSUE PAPER, looks at it with disgust. \nPATIENCE \nOh God, what -- what is that?! \nHe looks over her shoulder, winces. \nLONE \nI could run it over to the lab... She tosses it in the dumpster, finally registering that she's drenched in WET GARBAGE. \nPATIENCE \nI'm sorry, it was nice talking to you, but -- I'm completely disgusting. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMortified, she hurries back to the entrance to her building. Lone looks after her, amused. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRENDY CLUB - NIGHT \nSPOTLIGHTS before a NIGHTCLUB, a CROWD behind a VELVET ROPE. A HANDSOME BOUNCER stands guard. SALLY AND PATIENCE are near the front of the line. Sally has transformed herself, with heavy make-up, a revealing skin-tight outfit that shows plenty of cleavage. Patience is in a conservative dress, one she might wear to work. Sally HOWLS with LAUGHTER at something Patience has just said. Patience looks grim. \nPATIENCE \nIt isn't funny. \nSALLY \n(still chuckling) Yes it is. All this time you've spent mooning over that hottie neighbor and he points a gun at you -- \nPATIENCE \nAt least it broke the ice -- \nSALLY \nI told you men go for trashy women. Patience rolls her eyes, looks over Sally's clothes. \nPATIENCE \nSpeaking of which -- how do you even stay in that outfit? \nSALLY \nWith any luck, I won't need to. \nPATIENCE \nI hardly recognize you. \nSALLY \nThat's the idea. I go out at night, I leave daytime Sally behind, become a different person. All women do. Except you, of course. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \n(shrugs, checks her watch) How long have we been here, an hour?    We're never getting in... A TRENDY COUPLE -- call them RANDY and SANDY -- push their way past PATIENCE, almost knocking her over. Randy's ELBOW gets her in the gut, Sandy's SPIKE HEEL drives into her foot. \nPATIENCE \nOw! SANDY looks at her blankly as PATIENCE hops, injured. \nPATIENCE \nYou could say I'm sorry? \nRANDY \nOkay, you're sorry. He and Sandy laugh as the BOUNCER unhooks the rope, steps aside for them to enter. \nPATIENCE \nGod, people are so rude. \nSALLY \nYes! Sally has just gotten the NOD, hurries forward. Patience follows, limping a bit. The BOUNCER blocks Patience's path, looking her over from head to toe, disapproving. \nSALLY \nShe's with me. \nBOUNCER \nThen you can stay out here too. \nSALLY \nShe happens to be a very fine human being -- \nBOUNCER \nPATIENCE \nI guess not... \nLONE \nThen -- bye, now. He sounds disappointed. As the door shuts, Patience clutches her hair, makes a SOUND of frustration, almost like a MEOW. \nINT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY \nPATIENCE flings open the door, calls after Lone: \nPATIENCE \nI want you... He turns, startled. Patience has a sultry, come-hither look in her eye, her VOICE has a lower, sexier tone. \nLONE \nExcuse me? She shudders. The sexy expression turns to one of shock and anxiety -- what has she done? Then, vamping: \nPATIENCE \nI want you, um, to forgive me.   For hitting you like that. \nLONE \nNo need -- woman living alone, you can't take any chances. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE nods unsurely, starts to retreat into the apartment. LONE thinks, calls out to her. \nLONE \nListen, I was gonna grab a cup of coffee... \nCUT TO: \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nLONE and PATIENCE move from a COUNTER with COFFEE CUPS in hand. Patience has cleaned up, dressed a little sexier than usual -- she looks good. \nPATIENCE \nSo, did you always want to be a policeman? (beat, rolling her eyes) God, listen to me, Conversation 101. \nLONE \n(a laugh) Hey, we gotta start somewhere. Actually, when I was a kid, I wanted to be a rock star. They take seats at a small table. \nLONE \nI was kind of a delinquent back then, got into some trouble. There was a cop who helped me out. Made a difference. I figured... maybe I could do the same. \nPATIENCE \nPlus you can still get into trouble. \nLONE \nRight, but for the good guys... So what do you do? When you're not dumpster diving or cleaning chimneys, I mean. \nPATIENCE \nAccounting.   That is, I used to, I just lost my job. \nLONE \nI'm sorry. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \nDon't be, it was pretty dull.   I guess when you get down to it, I'm pretty dull. Patience realizes she's not making for a great first date. \nPATIENCE \nLet me start over. It's just... I never got into any trouble or anything -- \nLONE \nCome on, never? \nPATIENCE \nWell, when I was little, but -- after I lost my folks I... I guess I turned into sort of a scaredy- ca -- um, pretty risk-averse. \nLONE \nThat's not a bad thing.   It's a pretty dangerous world. \nPATIENCE \nSometimes I just wish I was less of a wimp. \nLONE \nYou're not afraid to admit you're afraid -- that takes guts. \nAs if I don't have enough on my mind. GEORGES moves to a nearby SHREDDER.     He starts feeding in the \nMEDICAL PHOTOS. \nGEORGES \nChanges are going to have to be made... and change can be painful. He glances at a MAGAZINE AD lying on his desk. \nGEORGES \nIt isn't easy to eliminate an established brand... Finished shredding the medical photos, he picks up the AD -- it's an AD for BEAUNIQUE, featuring LAUREL'S FACE. \nWESLEY \nSir, are you seriously thinking of recalling Beaunique --? \nGEORGES \nI'm not talking about Beaunique. \nHe slips the AD into the SHREDDER. CLOSE -- as the machine turns THE AD into CONFETTI, we hear the VOICE of LAUREL \nAVENAL OVER: \nLAUREL (V.O.) \nA famous poet once said, beauty is truth, truth beauty... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. URBAN PARK - DAY \nA HOMELESS CAMP -- tents, boxes, etc. -- nearby. BAG LADIES stand in a line near MAKE-UP STOOLS, AVENAL GIRLS are busy painting their faces, doing their best. \nLAUREL (O.S.) \n...or maybe it's the other way around... FIND LAUREL AVENAL at a TABLE with a BANNER: \"AVENAL CARES.\" VIDEO CAMERAS are trained on her as she signs POSTERS, PERFUME BOXES, etc. while talking into a MIC. \nLAUREL \nThe point is, everyone deserves to look in the mirror and feel good about themselves. Be we rich or poor, we all must strive to be more beautiful than we can be... A PROCESS SERVER in a suit with a briefcase reaches Laurel, places a stack of papers in front of her. She starts to sign automatically, then stops, turns off the mic. \nLAUREL \nWhat is this? \nPROCESS SERVER \nLaurel Avenal, I am hereby serving you with a restraining order. \nLAUREL \nWhat? \nPROCESS SERVER \nYou are not to set foot within one hundred yards of any property owned or occupied by Avenal Beauty Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. \nLAUREL \nI -- this must be some sort of mistake -- \nPROCESS SERVER \nYou will, however, have sixty days to remain in residence at the Avenal estate, at the end of which time you and all your personal property must be -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAUREL \n(a desperate cry) Georges Avenal is my husband! The man pulls another document from his briefcase. \nPROCESS SERVER \nThat brings me to this petition for divorce... LAUREL looks shell-shocked. A CAMERA FLASHES. She turns and manages to force a stiff, trembling smile for the photographer. CAMERA FLASHES again, WHITING OUT the frame -- \nIRIS DOWN TO: \nINT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPATIENCE'S SLEEPING FACE.     She stirs, stretches. WIDER, she's lying on top of a BOOKCASE in a twisted, awkward position. MIDNIGHT jumps up and brushes against her. CLOSE ON PATIENCE'S EYES -- they FLY OPEN, GOLD-FLECKED and (for a moment) ELLIPTICAL. PATIENCE -- now pure CATWOMAN -- springs down gracefully and scans the dark apartment. She stretches her limbs languorously, licks her lips. She flexes her fingers, watching appreciatively as her CLAWS EMERGE. She reaches out and SPEARS LONE'S CARD on a fingernail, regards it as she picks up the receiver. With another CLAW she unhesitatingly punches in the number. When she speaks, after a beat, her voice is throaty, sexier -- whenever she's Catwoman, she'll talk this way. During the following, she toys with the long PHONE CORD like a cat. \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \n(on phone) Mmm, too bad you're not there... guess I'll have to go out and play by myself. She tosses the receiver aside and prowls the room, moving casually atop the back of the couch, from there to other pieces of furniture and the counter, hops down to the floor. She studies the place as if seeing it for the first time. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \nWhat a dump. PATIENCE plucks at the clothing she wears, frowning. She opens a DRESSER DRAWER and PAWS through the contents, like a cat digging in a litterbox, SHREDDING the clothes. \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \nUgh -- please -- frowsy -- She moves to a closet, throws open the door, rifling through the outfits, RIPPING them to bits, hurling them aside. \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \nDamn, I haven't got a thing to wear! True -- she's emptied and trashed the closet, SLAMS the door. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nCATWOMAN strutting confidently down the narrow GUARDRAIL between the two directions of SPEEDING TRAFFIC. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe could be out for an evening stroll, ignoring the SCREECHING BRAKES, HORNS, and STARTLED DRIVERS. She gives them a wave without bothering to look over her shoulder. \nEXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nA CHICKEN-WIRE DOOR explodes open and a FLOCK OF PIGEONS ROCKETS OUT of a COOP AT CAMERA. CATWOMAN emerges in a CLOUD OF FEATHERS, brushing a few stray ones off her outfit, with a cat-that-ate-the-canary smile. She cocks her head, listening in different directions for a new source of amusement -- snippets of VOICES, MUSIC, PLUMBING SFX, passing VEHICLES... it's like tuning a radio. Then she picks up a distant TINKLE of breaking GLASS -- \nINT. JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT \nDimly lit, an older, discount place. THIEF #1 methodically breaks DISPLAY CASES with a wrapped hammer, snatches up the contents -- necklaces, rings, etc. -- stuffing them into a \nBAG. \nAs he moves, a SHADOWY FIGURE -- CATWOMAN -- moves with him, looking over his shoulder, close enough to touch but unseen. Each time he turns his head, she has just slinked out of his view -- her timing is impeccable. THIEF #2, with a SHOTGUN, stands guard over a blindfolded, bound-and-gagged NIGHT WATCHMAN. CATWOMAN appears on the periphery of his vision, but when he turns his head she's disappeared behind a case -- she emerges on the other side just before he turns back. THIEF #3 is at work on a LOCKED STEEL CASE of DRAWERS with a BLOWTORCH and TOOLS. CATWOMAN STEPS LIGHTLY across the CASE above him, he looks up -- but there's nobody there. He returns to his work, gets the CASE open and pulls out a DRAWER revealing a RACK full of glittering DIAMONDS. \nCATWOMAN (O.S.) \nOooh, pretty. THE THREE THIEVES spin, looking around -- \nTHIEF #1 \nUp there! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHIEF #2 aims his SHOTGUN at -- CATWOMAN, perched on a narrow LEDGE at the ceiling moulding. She VAULTS down just as he FIRES, a SPRAY OF PLASTER. THIEF #2 pumps his shotgun, looking around frantically. \nTHIEF #2 \nWhat the hell was that?! CATWOMAN springs out from behind a DISPLAY CASE, gives Thief #2 a roundhouse KICK in the head that sends the man into a wall, knocking him cold. THIEF #1 pulls a HANDGUN, but the END OF THE WHIP wraps around it in a flash, yanks it from his hand. CATWOMAN SNAPS HER WHIP at Thief #1 and Thief #3, backing them into a corner. As she passes the tied-up GUARD, she uses her claws to SLASH his ropes. In time with WHIP CRACKS \nCATWOMAN \nYou boys -- thought you could just barge -- in here and take -- all these beautiful things -- that don't belong to you... The guard quickly tears off his GAG and BLINDFOLD, untying his own feet, then picks up the fallen handgun and trains it on the thieves. We hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING. CATWOMAN meanwhile swiftly gathers up fallen jewels, sweeping them into the swag bag. She pauses for a moment, thoughtful. \nCATWOMAN \n(to herself) What a lovely idea. \nWith lightning speed, she vanishes out the back with the bag. THE GUARD, totally focused on the thieves, doesn't even register she's gone. THIEF #3 points -- \nTHIEF #3 \nHey... \nEXT. JEWELRY STORE ALLEY - NIGHT \nCATWOMAN bounds out the exit, leaps atop BOXES, onto a window A/C UNIT, which totters with her weight, just as -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAN UNMARKED SEDAN screeches to a halt, and TOM LONE leaps out, GUN ready. He trains it on CATWOMAN -- \nLONE \nFreeze! CATWOMAN freezes. She blinks down at LONE, he's got a clean shot at her. She cocks her head, licks her lips. \nCATWOMAN \nYou are cute. LONE blinks at this uncommon response to a pointed weapon, continues to play it by the book. \nLONE \nI'm a police officer! \nCATWOMAN \nBet you look sweet in uniform.   And such a big gun... \nLONE \nI, I -- Come down here, now! \nCATWOMAN \nObviously you don't know much about cats.   I come when I want, not when I'm told. With that, she SPRINGS to the rooftop -- the force of her leap knocks the A/C free of the window, LONE has to dive out of the way as it CRASHES to the ground. \nEXT. ROOFTOPS/CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nCATWOMAN, silhouetted against the sky, is having a great time, leaping from building to building, scrambling across rooftops. POLICE SIRENS recede in the distance. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ZOO - DAWN \nTHE SUN is rising. PAN OVER a couple of GLITTERING JEWELS in the dirt. FIND CATWOMAN in the GOLDEN MORNING LIGHT, curled against what looks like a TIGER-SKIN PILLOW. She stirs and groans in her sleep, like someone waking with a hangover. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe blinks and frowns at the SUNLIGHT. Where am I? She sits up and realizes -- she was sleeping against the belly of the BENGAL TIGER, lying on his side in his sunken ENCLOSURE. CATWOMAN SHRIEKS and leaps to her feet, terrified, yanks OFF HER MASK. With the daylight, she's back to being plain old PATIENCE. She looks down in shock at her revealing outfit; the swag bag is looped into the whip around her waist. She's awakened the TIGER. Patience lets out another frightened CRY as he eyes her, no longer recognizing her as a friend. The tiger GROWLS, gets to his feet menacingly, starts moving in for the kill. PATIENCE scrambles for a heavily LATCHED DOOR, which she frantically wrestles to open, getting through and SLAMMING IT just as the TIGER LUNGES -- \nHow many have there been? \nEDNA \nNo one can be sure. I've found references scattered through history, but catwomen tend to lead solitary, secretive lives. Hard to blame them, it seems most were murder victims. PATIENCE has heard enough.     She rises, freaked out. \nPATIENCE \nI was murdered? Why would anybody kill me? No, I never did anything to... I don't want to break the rules! She moves out of the room, Edna follows. \nINT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nPATIENCE paces, EDNA looks on sympathetically. \nPATIENCE \nShe's like some demon, possessing me in the night, but -- but I can keep it under control during the day -- \nEDNA \nWell, cats do sleep most of the day -- \nPATIENCE \nWhen she takes over -- it's like, she just does whatever she feels like, she doesn't care what people think -- \nEDNA \nIs that so bad? \nPATIENCE \nYou don't understand -- I'm afraid she's going to hurt someone -- or get me killed. Again. PATIENCE is near tears.     EDNA puts her arms around her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \nThere's got to be a way to make it stop.   Some kind of, I don't know, garlic or wolfsbane or something... \nEDNA \n(thinking) A domestic cat can return to its natural state effortlessly. But once a cat's gone feral, it can never be tamed. \nPATIENCE \nOkay... that isn't helping. EDNA pulls back, looks Patience in the eye. \nEDNA \nRelax a little, learn to live with your inner cat. Even love her -- she has many admirable qualities -- integrate her into your life. If you accept the darker impulses, try to channel them -- maybe she'll come to be domesticated -- \nPATIENCE \nNo. I'm going to fight her.   I'm stronger than she is -- \nEDNA \nBut you're only fighting yourself -- \nPATIENCE \n-- and I'm going to win. Patience heads out the door.     Edna shakes her head; Patience isn't getting it. \nEXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY \nPOLICE TAPE across the entrance to the storefront. PATIENCE approaches warily, looking around to make sure no one's watching, nervous as hell. She sees an elderly JEWELER and a UNIFORM COP through the window. Patience withdraws a PAPER BAG from under her coat. She drops this beyond the police tape, KNOCKS on the door and RUNS. THE JEWELER comes out, looks down on the ground. He picks up the bag -- and sees the word \"SORRY!\" written on the paper. Opening the bag, he finds -- THE DIAMONDS AND JEWELS that Catwoman stole. \nEXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - ALLEY - DAY \nPATIENCE comes out of a back door of her building with a GARBAGE BAG, still looking around nervously, moving toward the dumpster in the alley. She tosses in the bag -- ANGLE IN DUMPSTER, the BAG spills open to reveal pieces of the CATWOMAN OUTFIT. PATIENCE moves back for the door -- \nLONE (O.S.) \nWe've got to stop meeting like this. She spins to see TOM LONE approaching from his sedan, parked in a LOT off the alley. PATIENCE is wary of him now, but he seems casual, smiling. She glances at the dumpster anxiously, he follows her sight-line, snooping as always. \nLONE \nDoing some spring cleaning? \nPATIENCE \nEmptying the catbox, actually. LONE quickly takes a step back from the dumpster. \nLONE \nSo -- that was a... surprising message you left for me. \nPATIENCE \n(embarrassed) Oh, well, uh -- musta been my cold medication talking. She sniffles and coughs unconvincingly. \nLONE \nWell anyway, if you still wanted to get together -- maybe we could get a bite to eat Friday night? PATIENCE pretends to think it over. \nPATIENCE \nYeah, maybe... \nINT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nLAUREL \n(thinking frantically) He never comes home anymore -- I, I know he's got a box for the ballet Friday night -- \nCATWOMAN \nI can't wait that long.    I want him now. \nLAUREL \nI swear I don't know where he is, he's left me! Oh God, my career is in the toilet, my whole life is over -- go ahead, tear me to pieces -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAUREL is beginning to get hysterical. Catwoman lets out a frustrated GROWL and lets go of her, this is useless. She starts for the door, Laurel sniffs back tears then follows. \nLAUREL \nWait... try the factory. I think that's where he meets Drano, his new mistress. \nCATWOMAN \nI'll check it out. \nLAUREL \nWhat do you want with him, anyway? \nCATWOMAN \nIt's personal. \nLAUREL \nAre you going to kill him? \nCATWOMAN \nDepends on my mood. \nLAUREL \nI'll pay you to kill him. \nCATWOMAN \n(surprised, impressed) And here I thought you were just some brain-dead mannequin -- \nLAUREL \nI'll even give you a lift, if you'll let me watch - \nCATWOMAN \nSorry, I work alone. But I like your attitude. \nCatwoman disappears into the night.       LAUREL looks after her admiringly. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AVENAL FACTORY - GEORGES' OFFICE - NIGHT \nMOOD MUSIC plays, GEORGES is    on the sofa, in a silk robe, beside DRINA. Drinks are on     hand, Georges is attempting to neck with her. She pays him     no mind, a remote in hand, rewinding a VIDEO that plays    on a plasma SCREEN. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nON TV, IMAGES OF DRINA dissolve into each other quickly -- she DANCES IN A BALL-GOWN, CHAIRS a CORPORATE BOARD MEETING, finally pulls into the winners' circle in a FORMULA RACE CAR, pulls off her helmet and shakes her hair out. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) \nDiscover the fountain of youth... in a jar. Beaunique by Avenal. DRINA hits pause, wrinkles her nose. \nDRINA \nI look fat. \nGEORGES \nWe'll shoot another. Georges moves in on Drina, as the CAMERA discreetly pans to the WINDOW over the factory. \nINT. AVENAL FACTORY - NIGHT \nA small crew of NIGHT WORKERS wearing JUMPERS and PAPER MASKS tend the elaborate industrial MACHINERY, it's DEAFENING here. SWIRLING GOO the color of HUMAN SKIN PUMPS through PLASTIC PIPES into a huge SEALED VAT. RAINBOWS of NAIL POLISHES squirt out of NOZZLES into BOTTLES. LIPSTICK STICKS screw down into their TUBES and are CAPPED on \nCONVEYOR BELTS. \nOVERHEAD, amidst DUCTING and PIPES, CATWOMAN is on the move. HER CLAWS rake across a row of RUBBER TUBES, which spray multi-colored FLUIDS. \nHER GLOVED HANDS spin hydraulic VALVES. HER BOOT kicks a CONVEYOR BELT WHEEL, twisting it sideways -- the BELT JAMS, SMOKE rises from the clogged gears. A PANEL slides open over a bank of SWITCHES and WHACK-IT buttons. Her gloved fingers start HITTING THEM at random. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWITH A WORKER DRONE, CLICKING a hand counter by rote as CASES of neatly-packed jars of NAIL POLISH pass by his station. The man is half-asleep. A CASE COMES BY, a bit crooked on the belt, which is beginning to VIBRATE... The next CASE is missing half its bottles. An ALARM BLEEPS, RED LIGHTS FLASHING in b.g. The next CASE is filled with BROKEN GLASS, DRENCHED in NAIL POLISH -- it gets his attention. He THROWS LEVERS to stop the belt. WIDER, THE FACTORY is in CHAOS. STEAM     shoots out of PRESSURE TUBES, COLORED LIQUIDS bubble    out of overflowing TANKS, FACE POWDER sprays into the air    from a disconnected HOSE. WORKERS dash about frantically,     SHOUTING and PANICKED. \nINT. AVENAL FACTORY - GEORGES' OFFICE - NIGHT \nTHE CHAOS in the factory is clearly visible through the window, but GEORGES can't hear a thing -- he and DRINA are groping each other on the couch now. A nearby INTERCOM is BUZZING, Georges finally pushes a talk button, angry. \nIvan Nevski -- His head tilts back -- she's face-to-face with a CORPSE, he's been shot a couple of times in the chest. He's bluish, eyes glazed -- very dead. \nCATWOMAN \n(annoyed) You're no help. She SNIFFS the air, turns toward -- -- a SMOLDERING FIRE in the FIREPLACE. Catwoman moves toward this, studies the ASHES and BURNED PAPERS, then reaches in and snatches out -- -- the REMAINS of a TEXTBOOK.     The cover reads \"YERSINIA \nPESTIS - A NATURAL HISTORY.\" \nThe book is hot to the touch, she DROPS it, studies it. \nCATWOMAN \nYersinia Pestis... YP... A SINGED NEWS CLIPPING protrudes from between the pages, she plucks this out. CLOSE -- \"BUSINESSMAN DENIES TERRORIST LINK,\" with a PHOTO of XAVIER BARTOK, his name in the caption below. CATWOMAN is reading, absorbed, when -- THE FRONT DOOR swings open -- A UNIFORM COP and a LANDLADY with a ring of keys step inside -- \nLANDLADY \nDr. Nevski, are you all -- aah! They see CATWOMAN. She HISSES, bolts for the window and vanishes while the COP still fumbles for his gun. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ARMS CACHE - DAY \nLush vegetation and tropical sunlight through walls of netting in this immense camouflage tent. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAMERA MOVES PAST racks of AIR-TO-AIR MISSILES, RPGs, a JET FIGHTER and a large military CARGO CHOPPER. XAVIER BARTOK, a well-dressed, heavyset man with a CIGAR in his mouth, accompanied by a couple of BODYGUARDS, is showing off a crate of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS to a couple of REBELS in combat fatigues. They speak in rapid SPANISH, examining the guns, sighting them, etc. XAVIER excuses himself to answer a ringing CELL PHONE.       He speaks with a vague European ACCENT. \nXAVIER (V.O.) \n(on phone) Acquisitions -- \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. AVENAL FACTORY - DAY \nWESLEY is on his cell phone on the main FACTORY FLOOR. The place is a WRECK, as WORKERS clean up the mess Catwoman made. \nWESLEY (V.O.) \n(on phone) This is supply. There's been a slight complication, my employer wishes to move up the exchange -- tomorrow night. \nXAVIER \n(snorts) Impossible -- there are issues of transport, available funds -- \nWESLEY \nWe're willing to adjust the price. But if you can't pick up the goods tomorrow, we'll have to take our business elsewhere. \nXAVIER \nThis isn't your first 'complication.' WESLEY unlocks a door to -- \nEXT. LOADING DOCK - DAY \nA FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises to reveal MANY CANISTERS of \nYP-3. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWESLEY waves to ANGEL at the controls of a FORKLIFT -- Angel still has dried flecks of MAKE-UP on his skin. He pulls forward, ready to load the YP-3 into a waiting TRUCK. \nWESLEY (V.O.) \n(on phone) It'll be eliminated, like the others.   We just don't want to take any chances. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nON TV, AN ARTIST'S RENDITION of CATWOMAN, made to look far more menacing and mean. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) \nCatwoman has struck again -- FOOTAGE of a sheet-covered CORPSE being wheeled out of Nevski's duplex. A BANNER: \"CRIME BREAK,\" a LOCAL NEWS LOGO. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) \nThis costumed criminal has now added murder to her resume of mischief and mayhem... REVERSE ANGLE -- PATIENCE, sprawled on the couch in baggy sweat-clothes, reacts to this with a stunned expression. ON TV, \"NEWS VIDEO\" of SANDY from the club. \nSANDY (V.O.) \n-- she attacked us for no reason! And her outfit, I mean, that whole S & M thing is so 90s -- THE DOORBELL RINGS, PATIENCE moves to answer, attention still on the TV. She throws the door open quickly -- \nTOM LONE takes a step backward, hands up defensively. \nLONE \nJust me -- \nPATIENCE \nOh my God.   Our date... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWell, she is interesting, isn't she?     Kind of a... colorful character? \nLONE \nShe's a thief and a killer. \nPATIENCE \n(heatedly) I don't believe that. (covering) I mean -- whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty? LONE seems a little taken aback at her vehemence. Just then, a JAPANESE WAITER places a HUGE TRAY OF SUSHI between them. \nPATIENCE \nGuess I went a little crazy ordering. \nLONE \nIt's refreshing. A lot of women won't let a man see them eat. \nPATIENCE \nRight, then we go home and binge on Haagan-Dazs. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDuring the following, Lone meticulously mixes soy sauce and wasabi, uses chopsticks, etc. Patience simply peels the fish off the rice and pops it in her mouth, as if eating potato chips, then licking her fingers like a cat licking its paw. \nLONE \nYou do hide things, don't you. You may seem all sweet and shy, but you've got a secret wild side. \nPATIENCE \nWomen in general, you mean. \nLONE \nRight.  Women in general... (watching her reaction) You know, I actually saw Catwoman the other night. From a distance. Goofy costume. \nPATIENCE \nReally?     I heard it was... sexy. \nLONE \nIn a way. \nPATIENCE \nSo it could be sexier... with what, maybe a wide belt? \nLONE \nWhy so interested? \nPATIENCE \nYou brought it up. LONE studies her for a few seconds. He seems on the verge of saying something important. But instead: \nLONE \nYou want that toro? LONE is already reaching for another piece of sushi -- with lightning reflexes, PATIENCE grabs his hand to stop him -- he looks up at her, surprised. She backs off with a smile: \nPATIENCE \nNo no, it's yours. She eyes the fish hungrily as he eats it. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE AREA - DAY \nLONE and PATIENCE walk close together, near the water. \nLONE \nGonna have to get back to the station, I'm working nights. \nPATIENCE \nCatwoman again? \nLONE \nAfraid so. But I have a feeling she'll be in custody within the week. \nPATIENCE \n(alarmed) Why do you say that? \nLONE \nIndividuals who feel compelled to act out through an animal alter-ego -- bats, birds, bugs, there have been a number of cases in other cities -- they catch themselves. Take too many risks, think they can play with the cops. See, they like to be watched... He's staring right at her now.     Patience looks away. HER POV -- THE SUN GETTING LOW, vanishing behind a cloud. CLOSE, PATIENCE'S PUPILS become ELLIPTICAL for a blink. LONE pauses, standing close. \nLONE \nSorry.   Seems like all I can do is talk about work. PATIENCE spins on him, a glint in her eye. \nPATIENCE \nSo stop talking. So saying, she throws her arm around his neck, the other around his back, pulls him close for a KISS. Lone takes only a moment to respond -- it's a good one -- until -- CLOSE ON LONE'S BACK as her CLAWS involuntarily emerge, tearing right through his shirt and an inch down his back -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE (O.S.) \nEdna, it worked. I think... I think I've beaten her. I'm Patience again. I've won. \nEDNA \nOh, I'm so glad... Edna looks terribly relieved as she throws aside the bolt and begins to open the cellar door. But before she can -- -- THE DOOR FLIES OPEN, knocking her off her feet.        A FIGURE STREAKS PAST. We hear her voice as she retreats: \nCATWOMAN \nSucker. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT \nA BALLET in progress -- \"Giselle.\" Lithe DANCERS spin gracefully across the stage, a rustic village setting. FIND a HIGH BOX to one side. GEORGES and DRINA, in formal clothes. GEORGES is absorbed in the performance, DRINA looks bored, wrinkles her nose. \nDRINA \nWhat is this about? \nGEORGES \nSsh. (impatient whisper) Giselle is mistreated by a cruel prince and kills herself. Later, the souls of betrayed women come back from the grave for revenge. DRINA makes a SNORING NOISE, puts on a WALKMAN, and is soon bobbing her head to faint ROCK MUSIC. \nEXT. CITY STREET - CONCERT HALL - NIGHT \nBALLET MUSIC CONTINUES OVER. A CITY BUS passes, an AD FOR AVENAL on the side -- it's been VANDALIZED, CLAW MARKS across the length of it. CRANE UP to find CATWOMAN crouched on the roof of the bus. She leaps off from the still-moving bus -- -- onto the ROOF of a TAXI passing the other way -- -- and finally landing at the curb near -- A classical-looking CONCERT HALL, FOUNTAINS in front. CATWOMAN creeps amongst bushes, approaching the building. Numerous COPS patrol the entrance -- no way to get past them. \nCATWOMAN creeps around the perimeter, looking for another way in. By the curb she spots -- ANGEL, alone, near a parked LIMOUSINE, lighting a cigarette. \nCATWOMAN \nThose things'll kill you. She SMACKS the cigarette out of his hand, BOOTS him into the BUSHES and leaps on top of him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIN THE BUSHES, CATWOMAN straddles ANGEL, bangs his head against a cement curb. \nCATWOMAN \nYP-3 -- the plague -- what's it for? \nANGEL \nI have no idea what you're -- BANG!   She whams his head again. \nCATWOMAN \nTell me about Xavier Bartok. \nANGEL \nHow do you know -- She BANGS his head again. \nCATWOMAN \nI'm asking the questions. \nANGEL \nI -- I can't tell you -- She bares her CLAWS over his eyes. \nCATWOMAN \nThen it's time to brush up on your Braille. \nANGEL \nNo, no, not my eyes!      Xavier, he's the one who's buying the stuff! \nCATWOMAN \nWhen? \nANGEL \nThe deal goes down tomorrow night -- at the Avenal offices -- \nCATWOMAN \nWrong.   Your boss won't live to see it. She BANGS his head hard again, ANGEL loses consciousness. \nCATWOMAN \nThanks for your help. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATWOMAN moves around the side of the building, keeping low, ducking behind parked cars. Fewer COPS here, but the place looks impregnable, no way to scale the walls. She tries an EMERGENCY DOOR -- locked, no good. She hisses in frustration, starts to move on when -- THE DOOR OPENS behind her.     CATWOMAN spins to see -- LAUREL, her face hidden with dark glasses and a wide-brimmed hat. She gestures frantically. Catwoman darts inside. \nINT. CONCERT HALL - BASEMENT - NIGHT \nLAUREL whips off the hat and glasses, gives a girly hug to Catwoman, who pulls back immediately. \nLAUREL \nI knew you'd come. Laurel leads Catwoman through this basement boiler room. \nINT. CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nCATWOMAN darts effortlessly across the overhead grid, when -- \nLONE \nFreeze! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOM LONE, anticipating her move, has climbed a ladder to the grid. He trains a gun on her -- CATWOMAN freezes. She stares at him, breathing hard, taking a moment to come to grips with this adversary. LONE advances on her, stepping gingerly. \nLONE \nYou're under arrest -- He steps on a flimsy support, which starts to give way. Catwoman is alarmed. \nCATWOMAN \nWatch out! LONE sways, losing his balance, she springs and grabs his gun arm, saving him. A beat as they look at each other, then -- -- she SNATCHES the gun out of his hand, tosses it aside, then grabs his tie and pulls his face to her to LICK his cheek. \nCATWOMAN \nTag, you're it. She bounds away, comfortable on the narrow railings. Lone pursues, moving more carefully now. Accompanied by the ballet music, the two perform their private dance, high above the TOMBSTONES and GRAVES. CATWOMAN winds up in a corner on a MESH PLATFORM, no way out from here, but for a 25-foot drop to -- THE FLOOR, where POLICE await, pointing upward. LONE advances, he has her trapped.     He pulls HANDCUFFS. \nCATWOMAN \nHandcuffs.   Yummy. He lunges at her -- she dodges, kicks a leg out from under him. No slouch at fighting, Lone recovers, plants a kick in her mid-section. She gasps, surprised. \nCATWOMAN \nYou play rough. \nLONE \nThis isn't a game. He charges at her, but she parries a blow, lands a SLASH across his shoulder. As he comes at her again, she jumps and grabs an overhead ELECTRICAL cable, swinging away -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLone has too much momentum, he loses balance, about to go over the edge -- CATWOMAN swings back like a pendulum, wrapping her legs around his neck, saving him from falling. She swings him back over the platform, tries to kick him off, but he grabs her legs, pulling her and SNAPPING THE CABLE -- STAGE LIGHTS go out, ELECTRICAL SPARKS fly as they hit the platform together, she lands straddling him, catching the SPARKING CABLE just before it strikes the mesh. \nLONE \nBe careful!   That thing hits the metal, we're both fried! CATWOMAN leans close, whispers: \nCATWOMAN \nI knew there was a spark between us. She turns and flings the cable away, it dangles free of the mesh floor, still spitting SPARKS. A second later, CLICK -- LONE has slapped a handcuff on her wrist, CLICKS the other cuff over his own. CATWOMAN spins back on him, looking hurt. He reaches to pull off her mask. She slaps his hand. \nCATWOMAN \nPlease, it's our first date. I wouldn't want the mystery to go out of our relationship. LONE struggles to push her off, but she keeps her thighs locked around him. He finally rolls on top of her. \nLONE \nWe don't have a relationship. \nCATWOMAN \n(mock sadness) You men love the chase, but once you catch us, you always lose interest. As she speaks, CLOSE on her cuffed hand -- her fingers squeeze together, her hand slithers out of the cuff like a cat's paw. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLONE rises, tries to pull Catwoman to her feet -- but he comes up with an empty, dangling HANDCUFF. From the ground, CATWOMAN plants a kick in his back from behind, he falls forward and SLAMS his FACE HARD into a LIGHT RIG. Catwoman winces, sounding a lot like Patience: \nCATWOMAN \nSorry. She's on her feet, ready to scamper off, but -- MORE COPS have made it to the grid, blocking every way down - \nANGLE DOWN, COPS have covered every exit below. LONE glares up at her. \nLONE \nIt's over. \nCATWOMAN \nAnd here I thought we were hitting it off... With that, she leaps and grabs the dangling POWER LINE which TEARS LOOSE from the ceiling -- She DROPS to the floor, still holding the CABLE.     COPS surround her, moving in quickly, guns drawn -- She backs toward the wall, near a CIRCUIT BREAKER PANEL. \nCATWOMAN \nShow of hands -- who can see in the dark? She lifts her own hand daintily, then violently SWINGS THE POWER CABLE into the CIRCUIT BREAKERS -- \nA FLASH, a BANG, a SHOWER OF SPARKS -- then -- PITCH DARKNESS. We hear SHOUTS from the theatre, people PANICKING, and a series of GRUNTS and OOFS as Catwoman takes out the nearest adversaries -- CATWOMAN POV -- CATVISION, FIGURES have a pale outline, their EYES GLOW, as CATWOMAN dispatches her unseeing opponents. \nEXT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE DOOR & SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nA SIDE DOOR swings open and CATWOMAN darts out.    She's almost home free when SHOTS RING OUT behind her -- ANGEL, staggering out from the bushes where she clocked him, FIRES his handgun after her. CATWOMAN stumbles and rolls, but keeps moving. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EDNA'S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEDNA holds a few CATS in her arms, WEEPING quietly, tissue close at hand. There's a sound of SCRATCHING at the window, she moves to open it, revealing -- CATWOMAN, exhausted and bruised from her battle.   She crawls in the window, as Edna stares in astonishment. \nEDNA \nPatience? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLONE \n(shakes his head sadly) One thing you learn in this line of work -- you never really know anybody, not completely. (professional tone) You're being charged with vandalism, burglary and the murder of Doctor Ivan Nevski -- \nPATIENCE \nHe was dead when... um, Ivan who? (a beat, floundering) You, you have no proof that I -- what are you doing? LONE is unbuttoning his shirt.     He pulls down one side to reveal his shoulder. \nLONE \nThese scratches were inflicted last night by Catwoman. Forensics also tested this scratch -- He turns around to show the claw-mark she left when they kissed. He turns to face her, rebuttoning his shirt. \nLONE \nThey were made by the same implement. \nPATIENCE \nSo this whole time, you've been flirting, buying me dinner, acting like you were interested -- I was a suspect? It was just some cat and mouse thing? LONE's a little offended, his tone becomes more aggrieved: \nLONE \nNo, not at first -- I really bought the act, vulnerable girl all alone in the big city -- \nPATIENCE \nSorry if I don't fit into your damsel in distress fantasy. \nLONE \nThat's not what -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \nReal people are a little more complicated. \nLONE \nLook, I didn't want to believe it, but -- \nPATIENCE \nI guess a strong woman can be intimidating to a certain kind of man -- \nLONE \nDid you really think I wasn't gonna recognize you in a little mask? I'm not blind. \nPATIENCE \nSo if they don't need rescuing, you better lock them up yourself -- They're now talking over each other, sounding just like bickering lovers. LONE glances at the mirror, embarrassed; they're obviously being watched. Through his teeth: \nLONE \nKnock it off. (flat, Sgt. Friday) It'll go a lot easier on you if you just confess now. \nPATIENCE \nI've been doing some investigating of my own. A real crime. Georges Avenal is stockpiling YP-3, a variant of black plague bacteria -- \nLONE \nOh yes, your little hobby.   Please, Patience -- \nPATIENCE \nIt's a bioweapon! Ivan Nevski developed it, they must've killed him to keep it a secret -- \nLONE \nSo now you've constructed a paranoid fantasy with your former boss at the center. A disgruntled employee -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \nThe deal's going down tonight, they're meeting an arms dealer named Xavier Bartok at the Avenal offices -- \nLONE \nYou're hallucinating. Georges Avenal is world famous, worth millions, a respected businessman -- why in God's name would he get involved in arms trafficking? \nPATIENCE \nI don't know!    Why don't you ask him? \nLONE \nEnough.   Are you denying you're Catwoman? \nPATIENCE \n(looks away from him) It doesn't matter what I say.   You'll make me whoever you want me to be. LONE looks at her for a moment, then exits, leaving Patience to study her own defiant expression in the mirror. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe hits a SPEED-DIAL button, we hear a phone RINGING as she PEELS off the CAT MASK -- and a WIG... it's LAUREL AVENAL. We hear XAVIER'S VOICE: \nXAVIER (V.O.) (FILTER) \nAre we on? \nLAUREL \nOh honey, we are so on. \nINT. CHURCH - NIGHT \nCHAOS, PARAMEDICS, COPS, a FORENSICS TEAM photographing George's corpse. Nearby, other COPS bag the HANDGUN. TOM LONE is here, on his cell phone, heading for the exit. \nLONE \n(on phone) Yeah, we got a couple dozen witnesses, it was Catwoman. Looks like it might be the same weapon that killed Nevski... \nEXT. CHURCH - NIGHT \nLONE moves outside, past FILM TRUCKS outside this urban church, still on the phone. \nLONE \n(on phone) Nah, couldn't have been Price after all, musta been a lab error. You better cut her loose right away or she's gonna have a hell of a lawsuit on her hands... yeah, be there soon, I just gotta tie up a couple loose ends. He climbs in his sedan and moves off. \nEXT. AVENAL HQ - NIGHT \nLONE'S SEDAN pulls up near the entrance to the office tower. As he gets out, he hears a CHOPPER coming in overhead and looks up to see -- The AVENAL BEAUTY sign high above, a TWIN-ROTOR CHOPPER approaching the helipad. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLONE moves toward the showroom entrance, tries the door -- locked. He sees the entrance to the PARKING GARAGE, moves down the ramp. \nEXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT \nTHE MILITARY CARGO CHOPPER touches down. XAVIER and FOUR MERCENARIES emerge. Two mercs carry ALUMINUM SUITCASES, all are armed with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. In addition to chopper SOUNDS, there's a WHISTLING WIND up here and the WHITE NOISE ROAR of A.C. DUCTS. LAUREL, still in the cat suit but without the mask, is waiting. XAVIER approaches, a small BRIEFCASE in hand. Laurel's manner is cold, professional, all business -- she couldn't be more different from the victimized female we met up here at the outset. \nXAVIER \nYour husband? \nLAUREL \nHe won't be a problem.    Ever again.   And I'm not even a suspect. She gestures to her outfit.       Xavier nods. \nXAVIER \nAmerican women. I'm always impressed. \nLAUREL \nLet's do some business. They head down the stairs. CAMERA MOVES, off the roof, to the roof of an adjacent, lower SKYSCRAPER -- and finds -- \nEXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nTHE REAL CATWOMAN. She paces, breathing hard, steeling herself for something, looking toward the Avenal building. A WINDOW WASHER RIG hangs halfway down the building, but it's quite a distance from this roof edge. \nCATWOMAN \nI can do this... right? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe's addressing MIDNIGHT, who non-commitally licks a paw. CATWOMAN moves to the far end of the roof and sprints toward the edge, leaps for all she's worth -- CATWOMAN sails through the air in a perfect arc, toward the window-washer rig... but she's going to fall short and plunge twenty stories. At the last second, she pulls out her whip and snaps it out around -- -- the cables of the rig. CATWOMAN SLAMS HARD against the side of the building, dangling from the whip. \nCATWOMAN \nOw. She struggles to pull herself upward. \nINT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nAn ALUMINUM SUITCASE opens -- STACKS of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. WIDER, WESLEY handles the suitcase. He starts to count the stacks of money, testing random bills with a COUNTERFEIT PEN. Meanwhile, Xavier's MERCS are moving aside the LADDERS and PAINT CANS. One yanks down the frilly DRAPERIES to reveal -- CANISTERS OF YP-3, dozens of them in a cutout portion of wall, more than we've seen before. Laurel's been hiding them here all along. Xavier opens his briefcase -- there's a TESTING KIT inside. \nXAVIER \nMay I? \nSo saying, XAVIER plucks a WHITE ROSE from an arrangement. He seals it into a clear PLASTIC CONTAINER, moves to a random canister, and attaches a NOZZLE tightly to the VALVE. Cautiously, he releases a small amount of PRESSURIZED LIQUID into the container. CLOSE -- as the MIST makes contact with the ROSE, the PETALS turn PINK, then RED BLOTCHES appear. Abruptly, the petals BLACKEN, WITHER and ULCERATE. The flower is a shriveled mess in seconds. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nXAVIER \nNice. XAVIER carefully removes the nozzle, nodding appreciatively at the canisters. \nXAVIER \nAvenal should think about getting out of cosmetics altogether -- chemical weapons are a growth industry. THE MERCS, with slightly nervous looks, begin carefully moving the canisters out of the penthouse, up the stairs to the helicopter. THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN -- it's ANGEL. \nANGEL \nLook what I found. He lifts the semi-conscious LONE from the floor -- the man's been bound, gagged and blindfolded with DUCT TAPE, there's a bruise on his head. ANGEL flashes LONE'S BADGE. \nEXT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE GARDEN - NIGHT \nWESLEY and ANGEL have emerged from the penthouse, alarmed, just as LAUREL and XAVIER nearly trip over the groaning \nMERCENARY #2. \nXAVIER \nWhat the hell --? Xavier takes the man's AUTOMATIC WEAPON, he and Laurel hurry up to the helipad. \nEXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT \nLAUREL and XAVIER reach the top of the stairs, followed by WESLEY and ANGEL, just as -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATWOMAN leaps down to the penthouse level from the helipad. The group is stunned to see the injured men. MERCENARY #1 is crawling out from behind the A.C. DUCT. LAUREL angrily grabs a MACHINE GUN from the dazed MERCENARY #3. To Xavier: \nLAUREL \nWhere did you find these clowns?! MERCENARY #4 and ANGEL scout the helipad's perimeter, guns at the ready. WESLEY nervously backs toward the stairs. \nWESLEY \nIf it's all right with you, Laurel, I'd just as soon be going... Xavier is looking around frantically. \nXAVIER \nThese are good soldiers.    It would take a team of men -- \nLAUREL \n(realizing) Or one woman. \nCATWOMAN (O.S.) \nLook what I found! All spin to see -- CATWOMAN standing at the edge of the helipad, above the sheer drop, holding THE TWO SUITCASES out to either side of her. She has a lit CIGAR clenched between her teeth. Behind her, the SKY is LIGHTENING with approaching dawn. ALL GUNS are trained on Catwoman, except Laurel's. \nLAUREL \nDon't shoot, you idiots!    She'll drop the money-- They don't lower their guns.        Catwoman narrows her eyes, speaks around the cigar. \nCATWOMAN \nHenchmen, Laurel? How tacky. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe jerks one of the cases -- the latch has been loosened, it POPS OPEN and CASH GOES FLYING into the wind -- DRIFTING from the rooftop to the city streets below. LAUREL reacts in agony. \nLAUREL \nNo, please-- don't do that again! CATWOMAN drops the emptied case and pulls the cigar from her mouth with a distasteful expression. Eying Laurel: \nCATWOMAN \nDon't you hate it when somebody shows up at a party wearing the same dress? LAUREL advances on Catwoman. \nLAUREL \nLet's face it -- we're alike, you and me. Catwoman ignores her, shouts to XAVIER and his men: \nCATWOMAN \nYou guys gotta be careful with this YP-3 stuff. It's a living thing, you know, a bacteria. If it gets too hot -- it dies. XAVIER looks from Catwoman to the FUEL pooling on the helipad, putting two and two together. He jerks his head at his mercs -- they start backing away toward the stairs. LAUREL is still focused on the money. \nLAUREL \nLet's split the rest of the money -- and there's more where that came from -- \nCATWOMAN \nTempting offer... We would make a pretty good team. Beyond the law, fighting the yoke of male oppression, sisters under the skin... LAUREL nods hopefully.     CATWOMAN looks thoughtfully at the cigar in her hand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATWOMAN \nNah, I still have to live with myself. So saying, she flicks the LIT CIGAR to the helipad -- IGNITING the spreading pool of gasoline -- XAVIER ET AL. sprint to LEAP OFF THE HELIPAD or CHARGE DOWN THE STAIRS as -- THE HELICOPTER EXPLODES in a glorious FIREBALL. LAUREL is thrown across the helipad by the BLAST, showered with CHOPPER DEBRIS. The men are hightailing it out of there, but Laurel gets slowly to her feet, machine gun ready, bent on revenge. Spotting CATWOMAN darting through the SMOKE and FLAMES toward the stairs, LAUREL FIRES a volley with a SCREAM of rage and charges after her in pursuit. \nEXT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE GARDEN - DAWN \nLAUREL hurries down the stairs to the garden, FIRING at -- CATWOMAN, as she darts into the penthouse.         Catwoman's nearly hit, showered with broken glass. \nINT. AVENAL HQ - LAUREL'S PENTHOUSE - DAWN \nThe roof CREAKS ominously, the room is thick with SMOKE. LAUREL charges in, sees movement near THE ELEVATOR and FIRES \nA BODY goes down with a CRY.          LAUREL laughs triumphantly, moves to find -- ANGEL, dead on the floor.       LAUREL winces. \nLAUREL \nSorry, Angel. CATWOMAN leaps at Laurel from behind, the GUN goes flying. The two women CRASH into the CLASSICAL SCULPTURES, shattering them in the course of their struggle. Laurel keeps going for the gun, but Catwoman won't let her get near it. \nINT. AVENAL HQ - SHOWROOM - DAWN \nWESLEY, XAVIER and his MERCS hurry from the elevators. They've almost made it out the exit to safety when an EERIE HOWL erupts -- \nLAUREL \nNo!   My face! PATIENCE/CATWOMAN knocks her to the ground, straddles her. The fight's gone out of LAUREL now, she clutches at her disfigured features. Patience/Catwoman cocks her head, looking at the shredded LATEX hanging from her claws. \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \nSo I'm not the only one hiding behind a mask. \nLAUREL \nI was the first to try Beaunique -- I was over 30, I had nothing to lose. When the symptoms started to show, it was too late... As she speaks, Laurel peels away the remains of the LATEX. \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \nSo you upped production and sold the stuff to an arms dealer. \nLAUREL \nLife hands you lemons, you make lemonade. \nA FLAMING BEAM gives way, blocking the STAIRWELL, part of the CEILING collapses -- this gives Laurel the chance to squirm out from under PATIENCE/CATWOMAN. But instead of going for the gun, she runs straight for the make-up mirror. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN runs to Lone's side, pulling him away from the spreading flames toward the ELEVATOR. She SLASHES the tape that binds his wrists. LAUREL, meanwhile, opens a hidden COMPARTMENT by her mirror, revealing numerous LATEX MASKS. She begins to apply a new one, using adhesive, smoothing wrinkles, hiding the seams, etc. Nearby, her PORTRAIT starts to MELT and turn to ASH. THE CEILING BUCKLES, chunks of MASONRY falling. PATIENCE/CATWOMAN is prying open the elevator doors. \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN \nLaurel, you better get out of here -- \nLAUREL \nIn a minute -- I have to finish putting on my face \nTHE DOORS OPEN on the empty shaft -- almost as an afterthought, PATIENCE/CATWOMAN snatches up her MASK, pulling LONE to her with her other arm. THE CEILING gives way with a BURST OF FLAME -- \nINT. AVENAL HQ - ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY \nPATIENCE/CATWOMAN leaps into the open elevator shaft, LONE has his arms around her -- together they slide down a CABLE as FLAMES ERUPT from above. \nINT. AVENAL HQ - LAUREL'S PENTHOUSE - DAY \nLAUREL is now trapped in the make-up alcove, illuminated by flames surrounding her, but she doesn't seem to care, working frantically to get a new face on. She whispers a mantra: \nLAUREL \nYou're still beautiful... you'll always be beautiful... CRASH! CHUNKS OF HELIPAD and the remains of the FLAMING CHOPPER come through the ceiling, obliterating Laurel. \nEXT. AVENAL HQ - DAY \nPOLICE charge into the building from a number of COP CARS. As they do so, we see the ARMY OF CATS fleeing. \nINT. AVENAL HQ - SHOWROOM - DAY \nWESLEY, XAVIER and the MERCS are on the ground, SCRATCHED and BLEEDING. They raise their hands for the puzzled, gun- wielding COPS. \nWESLEY \nThank God you're here... \nINT. AVENAL HQ - PARKING GARAGE - DAY \nELEVATOR DOORS OPEN in this parking garage. PATIENCE/ CATWOMAN pulls LONE out, he seems woozy, his arms around her neck. They collapse together against a wall. She tears the DUCT TAPE off Lone's mouth.   He winces. \nLONE \nWho are you? PATIENCE/CATWOMAN hesitates, about to answer -- but instead gives him a long kiss. Then she darts OUT OF FRAME. LONE reels from the kiss, then collects himself and pulls the duct tape from his eyes. WIDE SHOT -- he's alone, no sign of her. \nEXT. AVENAL HQ - DAY \nOVERHEAD ANGLE as COPS hustle XAVIER and the OTHERS into police vehicles. CAMERA KEEPS PULLING UP, until we see the ruined ROOF of the building, IN FLAMES. The \"A\" in \"AVENAL BEAUTY\" has been knocked out by the conflagration ... for a few moments the sign reads \"VENAL BEAUTY,\" until the whole thing EXPLODES and SPARKS OUT. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nEDNA lies on the couch, a hand over her eyes, asleep in a robe. She stirs as a TONGUE laps at her face. As she sits up, dozens of CATS are all over her, begging for attention. She laughs and cries at the same time then sees -- CATWOMAN, masked again, who has entered behind the cats. \nEDNA \nThank you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATWOMAN \nA promise is a promise. Her tone is soft, more like Patience's.       EDNA takes in the blood on her, her torn clothes. \nEDNA \nWhat happened to you? \nCATWOMAN \nI found out the truth. Edna notes the SUNLIGHT pouring through the window, eyes her. \nEDNA \nBut the sun is up... you're still Catwoman? CATWOMAN pulls off the mask and looks at it, puzzled. \n", "test1_input": "CATWOMAN \nby Dan Waters \nbased on characters from DC Comics Batman by Bob Kane \nprevious revisions by John Brancato & Michael Ferris Laeta Kalogridis Theresa Rebeck Kate Kondell John Rogers \nSECOND DRAFT POLISH \nFebruary 11, 2003 \nFADE IN ON: \nINT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT \nSTART ON THE FACE of A GOLDEN CAT STATUE. This is the cat- god BAST, lithe, noble, beautiful. CAMERA MOVES to reveal the statue is 50 feet tall, dominating this space. Other images of CATS -- hieroglyphics, ceramics -- abound, as do -- REAL CATS, hundreds of them, slinking in the shadows on ramps cut into the sandstone walls of this Egyptian temple. At Bast's feet, EIGHT ACOLYTES in GOWNS kneel in a semi- circle around a flaming BRAZIER. Some of the women WEEP, others PRAY or stare stoically ahead. From outside, we now hear DISTANT SCREAMS, the sounds of MARAUDERS. There's a RHYTHMIC BANGING at the massive BRONZE TEMPLE DOORS. \nEXT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT \nTHE TEMPLE is an impressive place of worship -- tapered columns and an ornate Egyptian facade -- at the apex of a hilltop VILLAGE, in FLAMES, under ATTACK by a PERSIAN ARMY. \nSUPERIMPOSE:   \"496 B.C.\" \nWHAM! THE STEEL PRONG of a mounted BATTERING RAM swings into the ornate DOORS of the temple. PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the brutal siege engine, SLAM the doors again and again. \nINT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT \nThe HIGH PRIESTESS wears a special HOODED WHITE GOWN that mostly conceals her face. She moves from one ACOLYTE to the next, pours a DARK LIQUID from a bejeweled decanter into golden goblets, then pours one for herself. She raises her goblet toward BAST, as do the others -- they drink in unison. \nHIGH ANGLE as the GOBLETS CLATTER to the floor and the WOMEN SLUMP to the ground... dead. PULL BACK -- we're watching this from the PERSPECTIVE of an EGYPTIAN MAU CAT -- slim, elegant, dark-spotted gray and black fur, a SCARAB MARK on its head. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHE MAU lets out a CRY... which prompts an eerie, growing CHORUS of MEOWS and HOWLS from the other CATS. THE CATS emerge from the hiding places en masse, leaping from niches, converging on the bodies. The MAU leads the way, moves to the high priestess and puts its mouth to hers... ON THE TEMPLE DOORS - at last they BUCKLE and swing open. THE SOLDIERS, bearing TORCHES and SWORDS, storm inside. They grab anything of value, SMASH and DEFACE everything else. At the foot of BAST lie nine ROBES... but there's no sign of the women who wore them. SOLDIERS slash the robes with their swords anyway, then snatch up the goblets for booty. An unearthly CRY -- half-human, half-feline -- from somewhere high above the rampaging soldiers. They freeze, looking around frantically. More EERIE CRIES echo off the walls, from all directions. The SOLDIERS raise their weapons, clustering defensively. From out of the shadows above them, DARK HUMAN FORMS suddenly leap down with impossible agility. STAY ON THE FACE OF BAST, peering down impassively. The torch-cast SHADOWS of the violence below play upon the statue's golden surface... FLAILING SWORDS, the swift SILHOUETTES of NAKED WOMEN. We hear the GUTTURAL CRIES of the soldiers, clearly outmatched in this mortal combat. MOVE TO THE CATS, perched above the fray, looking downward as they pace the temple's ledges and ramps excitedly. THE MAU takes a final look at its handiwork, then leaps up, slinks through a crevice at the roof, and emerges on -- \nCUT TO: \nA ROOFTOP \nWe hear the modern SOUNDS of passing AUTO TRAFFIC.    CAMERA ROTATES to reveal -- \nEXT. EDNA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nTHE MAU settles by a SATELLITE DISH, looking down on a present-day suburban street, a busy main drag. MARSHLAND and WATER are visible not far away, light RAIN FALLS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSUPERIMPOSE:        \"2500 YEARS LATER.\" \nThe MAU watches as, ACROSS THE STREET, a BUS pulls away from the curb to reveal a WOMAN in a HOODED WHITE PONCHO -- the outfit recalls the high priestess of Bast. The HOOD is thrown back, revealing PATIENCE PRICE, 25-35, attractive but inclined to conceal her looks -- hair over her face, baggy clothes under her poncho. She's cautious, eager to please, to do what's expected of her -- a bit of a doormat. Patience looks up from an address scribbled on a scrap of paper, and straight toward the cat on the roof -- almost as if she'd sensed its presence. She smiles. THE MAU holds her gaze for a beat, then slinks out of sight. \nEXT. EDNA'S HOME - DAY \nAn eccentric, ramshackle home amongst neat, well-kept houses. PATIENCE moves to the front door, RINGS. As she waits, she notes the lawn GRASS grown high, CLIMBING CAT SCULPTURES on the shingles. A SIGN by the door: \"FELINE RESCUE SOCIETY.\" EDNA POWERS opens the door on a chain. She's 50-70, a former academic, intelligent, charming, but quite intimidating. \nEDNA \nYes? \nPATIENCE \nHi, Edna Powers? (off her nod) I'm Patience Price, I called about adopting a cat? I saw your flyer at my vet's office -- \nEDNA \nOh yes, do come inside. EDNA undoes the chain, opens the door for her. \nINT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nPATIENCE, out of her poncho, fills out a questionnaire on a clipboard. Numerous CATS roam the premises. Feline artwork and curios, scratching posts, furry toys... cat paradise. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \n... Ma'am? EDNA is putting out DRY CAT FOOD in numerous BOWLS. \nEDNA \nYou may call me Edna. \nPATIENCE \nEdna. Some of these questions are... kind of personal. Do you really need to know how many, um, partners I've had in the past year? \nEDNA \nI'm not interested in your love life. But I do want to know what sort of home environment you're offering, your degree of commitment... \nPATIENCE \nGuess I wouldn't need the cat if... Patience forces a laugh, fills in a ZERO and passes the clipboard to EDNA. The woman puts down the cat food, slips on the reading glasses she wears on a chain around her neck. \nEDNA \nThe application is mostly a formality.   I have a sense about people. \n", "test1_true": "Well, I've always liked animals. (not enough) Cats specifically. I mean, I love them... worship them, even. EDNA seems satisfied, returns to reading Patience's answers. THE MAU, meanwhile, comes around a corner into the room, peering curiously at Patience -- who dangles her hand invitingly. He rubs his face against her hand. PATIENCE smiles, coos at the cat -- which grabs her hand hard in his CLAWS. PATIENCE stifles a yelp, yanks her hand back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE \nSon of a -- \nEDNA \nExcuse me? \nPATIENCE \nNothing... handsome cat.   I've never seen one like him. THE MAU jumps into Patience's lap, settling in.      Edna, surprised and almost suspicious, eyes the cat. \nEDNA \nHer. That's Midnight, an Egyptian Mau.     Normally she doesn't trust people -- EDNA reaches a hand toward MIDNIGHT -- the cat's fur stands up, she HISSES and SWIPES at Edna. \nEDNA \nSee?    Even I can't get near her... Very strange. (glancing at the application) So.    You left out your parents' address. \nPATIENCE \nWell... they're both dead. \nEDNA \nNo hereditary illnesses, I hope. \nPATIENCE \nPrivate plane crash. I was eleven. Actually, the last thing they gave me was a kitten... Fatso. EDNA sucks her breath in at this insulting name. \nPATIENCE \nHe was very round -- not from overfeeding or anything, just -- really, he didn't mind. Anyway, he was with me a long time, till early this year. He didn't come at the sound of the can-opener, which kind of freaked me out... I found him just, curled up there in his little bed... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE is getting a bit emotional. EDNA reaches across and squeezes her hand, with genuine sympathy. MIDNIGHT snuggles into Patience's lap, PURRING as she strokes the cat. \nEDNA \nIt's very hard, dear, I know... you must be in so much pain. Midnight digs her long NAILS into Patience's thigh, kneading. PATIENCE winces, tries to dislodge cat's claws from her leg -- Midnight \"playfully\" attacks her hand. Stifling a gasp: \nPATIENCE \nMm-hmm. \nEDNA \nFunny how cats get under our skin. They do exactly as they please, they don't care what anyone thinks about them... they're the ultimate predators. So self-contained, so independent, so wild... sometimes I wonder, why do they even put up with us? \nPATIENCE \nThe free food? \nEDNA \n(putting the papers aside) Well, congratulations. It seems you've been chosen. \nPATIENCE \nSo you think you might have a kitten for me...? \nEDNA \nKitten? No, that wouldn't be appropriate. Midnight has chosen you. \nPATIENCE looks a little unnerved at this. MIDNIGHT, rolling on her back, seems to be baring her fangs at Patience. \nEDNA \nIt's a great honor. Maus are a very rare breed, descended from the sacred cats of ancient Egypt. They were believed to have magical gifts. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIDNIGHT has wrapped herself around Patience's arm, kicking and biting \"playfully.\" \nPATIENCE \nI'm not sure she likes me -- \nEDNA \nNonsense, she perceives something very special in you. \nPATIENCE \nThere's nothing special about me. \nEDNA \n", "test2_input": "NEIGHBOR \nEdna, your cats have been using my garden as a litter box again. \nEDNA \n(gravely) You can't change their nature. The neighbor scowls and returns to her weeding. As EDNA bends down for her newspaper, she hears a MEOW and sees -- -- Midnight licking a HAND, which protrudes from under a bush. Edna GASPS, moves closer, crouching to get a better look. It's PATIENCE, sound asleep, body twisted sideways in an unnatural position. Quietly: \nEDNA \nHello...? \nPatience starts awake, looking around, confused. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEDNA \nWhat are you doing in my hedge? Patience rolls out from under the bushes, crouches on her haunches now, a panicky look in her eyes. Leaves and dirt cling to her clothes. She has no idea how she got here. \nINT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nPATIENCE is wrapped in a BLANKET, sitting on the couch, MIDNIGHT nuzzling her, as EDNA brings her a cup of TEA.      Edna picks up a CLIPBOARD from a coffee table. \nEDNA \nYour name is Patience Price, you live on South 87th. (beat) You love chocolate -- you're afraid of heights? Any of this ring a bell? Patience nods slowly, puts her face in her hands. \nPATIENCE \nI... it's coming back to me. But last night... it's just... it's like a dream. \nEDNA \n(chiding) You said in your application that you don't drink or take drugs. \nPATIENCE \n(rising) I don't. I think... something must have happened. I need to... \nEDNA \nYou need to rest. Patience takes a few steps from the couch and lets the blanket slip from her shoulders. \nEDNA \nOh my God... Edna stares at PATIENCE'S BACK. The fabric of her dress is torn, the skin discolored beneath with a hint of dried blood -- and we make out the marks left by a TIRE TREAD. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEDNA \nYou're in no condition to -- EDNA moves beside Patience and GRABS HER by the wrist -- ON PATIENCE'S HAND, the fingers CURL and FIVE SHARP CAT CLAWS (SPFX) emerge from her fingertips -- only for an instant. EDNA blinks at this, PATIENCE whirls on her with an abrupt and frightening HISS -- CLOSE, Patience's pupils become ELLIPTICAL for a blink, flecked with GOLD, then -- She yanks her hand away quickly, immediately looks contrite, and a bit dazed from the momentary transformation. \nPATIENCE \nSorry, you -- you startled me... look, Edna, thanks for everything, but -- I just want to get home and take a bath. Edna nods, unnerved. PATIENCE picks MIDNIGHT up in her arms and hurries out the door. Edna stares after her, a disturbing thought forming. \nINT. EDNA'S HOME - OFFICE - DAY \nEDNA moves purposefully to a FILE CABINET in this cluttered, book-lined room and opens a drawer. She thumbs past many years' worth of scholarly research, finally pulling a thick, dog-eared MANILA FILE from near the back. She moves to her desk, slips on reading glasses and opens the folder -- ANGLE ON FILE -- an old, thick type-written SCHOLARLY PAPER entitled \"MYTHS OF FELIGYNY, by E. POWERS Ph.D.\" She puts this aside, revealing a WOODCUT of an AFRICAN Catwoman in leopard skin, surrounded by cats. Next, an ASIAN CATWOMAN, a print of a 19th Century watercolor. She wears a Chinese- style MASK, close-fitting robes, a long tail. Both illustrations show the women with CLAWS and ELLIPTICAL \nPUPILS. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY \nPATIENCE stares at her dirty face in the MIRROR, still reeling from the events of the previous night. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBehind her, THE BATHTUB RUNS, almost filled. She moves to the edge of the tub, starting to undo her ragged clothes, stares down at -- THE RIPPLING WATER.     She blinks, her expression far away -- \nFLASHBACK - INT. PATIENCE'S HEAD \nA vertiginous PLUNGE from the bridge toward DARK WATER -- \nINT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY (PRESENT) \nPATIENCE starts, shaking off this momentary vision. She dips a finger in the water, jerks back -- much as a cat might. She shakes drops off her hand, repelled by the water. \nINT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThere's KNOCKING at the door. The PHONE IS RINGING, a MACHINE picks up. We hear RUNNING WATER from beyond the closed bathroom door. \nPATIENCE (V.O.) \nThis is Patience, you can leave a message if you want... \nBEEP. \nINT.

MIDNIGHT lets out a menacing GROWL. THE KNOB TURNS, the door swings open -- a MAN starts to enter \nCLANG!   PATIENCE whacks him over the head with a FRYING PAN. THE MAN is knocked hard into the door and slumps to the ground, stunned... it's TOM LONE. PATIENCE recognizes him with horror, looks at the door -- PATIENCE'S KEYS with the \"HELLO KITTY\" emblem dangle from the lock, her PURSE is on the ground. \nPATIENCE \nI am so, so sorry -- TOM LONE groans, painfully coming to and sitting up. PATIENCE crouches at his side. \nLONE \nYou actually hit me with a frying pan? \nPATIENCE \nI didn't know it was you. \nLONE \nGuess we're even now.    Name's Tom Lone, by the way. \nPATIENCE \n(shakes his hand) Patience Price. \nLONE \nYeah, I know, I checked your ID. \nPATIENCE \nOh God, not that awful driver's license picture -- \nLONE \n(rubbing his head) Got any ice? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATIENCE hurries to assemble an ice pack, MIDNIGHT is eating happily at the table, LONE gets to his feet. \nLONE \nI found your purse in the street right outside this morning. I tried calling -- I was afraid something might've happened to you... PATIENCE returns with a washcloth full of ice. \nPATIENCE \nThat was really nice of you. \nLONE \nWell, it's part of my job... I'm a detective, burglary-robbery division. So what did happen to you? He applies the ice-pack to his head while eying her clothes. She suddenly becomes aware of her disheveled appearance. \nPATIENCE \nOh no, I'm a mess. It seems every time you see me I -- I was just cleaning. (this isn't flying) The um, the chimney. \nLONE \nWhere's the fireplace? \nPATIENCE \nIt wasn't mine. \nLONE \nYou're a freelance chimney sweep? LONE is now looking around the apartment, taking it all in with a careful detective's eye. He sees the shredded PHOTOGRAPHS, the BROKEN WINDOW, points -- \nLONE \nYou should get that fixed. \nPATIENCE \nOh yeah, I hadn't noticed... I mean, I had to break it to get in because... I lost my purse. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLONE \n(studying the windowsill) Funny, looks like it was broken from inside. Lone is now regarding her with open curiosity.     Patience shrugs helplessly. \nLONE \nSo everything's all right now? (off her nod) Well, I'd better be getting to the station, then... unless there's anything else.

CATWOMAN moves stealthily, crouching, senses alert. \nHER POV - CATVISION \nThe dark hallway GLOWS.   An amplified NOISE from a distance... SNORING. \nON CATWOMAN'S HANDS \nHer NAILS emerge from her gloved fingertips, ready to rumble. CATWOMAN rounds a corner toward a large formal staircase that wraps around a huge chandelier. She nears a door which is slightly ajar, pushes it open silently and enters -- \n", "test3_true": "HER POV -- CATVISION, nearing a huge, curtained CANOPY BED. CATWOMAN slashes the curtain aside, to reveal -- TIPPY THE LAP DOG, curled up in the center of the otherwise unoccupied bed, SNORING away. The dog awakens, raises its head, and starts BARKING FURIOUSLY. CATWOMAN hisses at the creature.   It cringes and shivers, seeking cover beneath a pillow. \nINT. AVENAL MANSION - HALLWAY & FOYER - NIGHT \nAs CATWOMAN comes out of the bedroom, a FIGURE emerges from the darkness swinging a GOLF CLUB -- WHAM! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe's struck hard in the back and the head -- she topples forward, ROLLS DOWN THE STAIRS. She hits a LANDING, curled up, dazed, clutching her skull. LIGHTS COME ON -- LAUREL looks down at her from the top of the stairs, wearing silk pajamas, golf club in hand. She descends cautiously, club raised. LAUREL tentatively pokes at the prone, black-clad Catwoman with her foot. CATWOMAN instantly SPRINGS UP. As Laurel starts to bring the club down, Catwoman grabs it and yanks it away, hurling it into the foyer below, then grabs LAUREL and slams her against the wall. Laurel seems utterly terrified - \nLAUREL \nOh God, please -- please don't hurt me! CATWOMAN studies the frightened woman, easing her grip. Laurel drops the act, and with a martial arts SHRIEK drives a KNEE and a FIST into Catwoman in rapid succession -- CATWOMAN flies over the banister, grabbing a hold of the chandelier. It swings in the open foyer -- THE CHAIN creaks ominously, starts to rip from the ceiling -- CATWOMAN snaps the whip around an upper BALUSTRADE, just as - \nTHE CHANDELIER rips loose from the ceiling.     As it CRASHES to the ground, CATWOMAN swings back at LAUREL and -- KICKS HER in the chest.     LAUREL goes down hard on the stairs. CATWOMAN stands over her. LAUREL looks up at her, outraged. The two women are of similar size and shape, well-matched. \nLAUREL \nThat was Venetian crystal, you bitch -- LAUREL launches a karate KICK at her, CATWOMAN deflects it, lands a blow of her own. \nCATWOMAN \nA bitch is a dog. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe two engage in martial arts combat, moving down the stairs into the marble foyer. They exchange lines between BLOWS: \nCATWOMAN \nYou're tougher than you look. \nLAUREL \nTook classes when I was modeling in Hong Kong. (lands a good one, then:) Damn it, I broke a nail. She's a skilled fighter, but CATWOMAN is faster, more nimble, able to avoid her attacks. Laurel suddenly pauses, looking winded, ready to give up the fight. \nCATWOMAN \nHad enough? \nLAUREL \n(nods, eying her outfit) Is that a Gaultier? Catwoman looks down at her clothes, giving Laurel the chance to grab a VASE OF FLOWERS, which she hurls at her -- IT SHATTERS, soaking Catwoman.          She shakes off water. \nCATWOMAN \nI hate water. Suddenly enraged, she lunges toward LAUREL, who hits the ground -- but CATWOMAN springs over her head, up to the landing where the LAPDOG yaps. She snatches it up by its collar, bares her CLAWS near its face. THE DOG shuts up, petrified. \nLAUREL \nNo, please -- not Tippy! \nCATWOMAN \nWhere's your husband? A BEAT as Laurel takes this in.         She lets out a little laugh. \nLAUREL \nGeorges? Why didn't you say you wanted him in the first place? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCATWOMAN slowly puts the dog down, it scampers upstairs. \nLAUREL \nYou one of his girlfriends? CATWOMAN springs back down, shoves Laurel against a wall, flexing her CLAWS. \nCATWOMAN \nI don't belong to anybody. \nLAUREL \nNot my face, not my face! \nCATWOMAN \nIf I can't get to Georges, I can at least scratch up something he loves -- \nLAUREL \nGeorges doesn't love me!    I don't know if he ever did -- \nCATWOMAN \nHow sad.   I'd cry if I cared. \nLAUREL \nHe never took me seriously, I was just a, a trophy. And now he's bored, he found himself a new toy -- \nCATWOMAN \nI've heard this story before.    Where is he? \n"}

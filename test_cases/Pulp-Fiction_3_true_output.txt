YOLANDA (crying) Don't you hurt him. 
JULES Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three Fonzies. And what' Fonzie like? 
No answer. 
JULES C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like? 
YOLANDA (through tears, unsure) He's cool? 
JULES Correct-amundo! And that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool. (to Pumpkin) Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when you do it, do it cool. Ready? 
Pumpkin looks at him. 
JULES One... two... three. 
Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table. 
Yolanda can't stand it anymore. 
YOLANDA Okay, now let him go! 
JULES Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool.  When you yell at me, it makes me nervous.  When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot. 
YOLANDA (more conversational) Just know: you hurt him, you die. 
JULES That seems to be the situation. Now I don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do. (to Ringo) Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. But you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass. 
VINCENT (O.S.) What the fuck's goin' on here? 
Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger. 
Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at Yolanda. 
JULES It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed. We're still just talkin'. (to Pumpkin) Tell her we're still cool. 
PUMPKIN It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still cool. 
VINCENT (gun raised) What the hell's goin' on, Jules? 
JULES Nothin' I can't handle. I want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary. 
VINCENT Check. 
JULES Yolanda, how we doin, baby? 
YOLANDA I gotta go pee! I want to go home. 
JULES Just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, Ringo's proud of you and so am I.  It's almost over. (to Pumpkin) Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet. 
PUMPKIN Which one is it? 
JULES It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it. 
Pumpkin looks in the bag and  sure enough  there's a wallet with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it. 
JULES That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there? 
PUMPKIN About fifteen hundred dollars. 
JULES Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score. 
VINCENT Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle. 
JULES You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo? 
PUMPKIN What? 
JULES Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible? 
PUMPKIN Not regularly. 
JULES There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years.  And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.  I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd. 
Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table. 
Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to Yolanda. 
She looks back. 
Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the door. 
Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a sip of coffee. 
JULES (to himself) It's cold. 
He pushes it aside. 
Vincent appears next to Jules. 
VINCENT I think we oughta leave now. 
JULES That's probably a good idea. 
Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the briefcase. 
Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes  wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics  walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word. 
FADE OUT

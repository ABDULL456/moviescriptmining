INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK 
FAUST (whispering) It's in the main air lock.  Blow the lock. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH. 
INTERIOR - AIR LOCK 
With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK 
The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK- HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR. 
FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST, crushing him to a thickness of about three inches. 
On the wall, a green light goes on: 
"INNER DOOR CLOSED" 
INTERIOR - AIR LOCK 
Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN. IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into the vacuum under pressure. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is sucked out toward the lock. 
A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES: 
"CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION" 
After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control room. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS 
Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways, as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along by the air current. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS 
Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance, HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR. 
Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running again. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK 
Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound is a DEAFENING WHISTLE. 
Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT. 
Done in, he collapses to the floor. 
Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD -- THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking underwater. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS 
Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses bleed. 
They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can only hear distant croaks. 
Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others follow him. 
INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM 
The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks. 
Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully. 
Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up. 
ROBY How much oxygen did we lose? 
Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges. 
STANDARD We've got six hours left. 
HUNTER (groans) Oh my God. 
STANDARD Does anybody know what happened?

- the computer monitor POV. 
Behind CALEB, a few of the people behind CALEB in the office are reacting. 
One stands and applauds. A GIRL comes out from behind her desk, runs over to CALEB, and embraces him from behind planting a kiss on his cheek. 
CALEB still looks dazed. 
He still has his headphones in. Still in the audio bubble, which, despite the commotion around him, remains unburst. 
TITLE: 
EX MACHINA 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY 
A spectacular mountain landscape. Waterfalls drop down massive rock faces to inland lakes. Rivers push through forest. Forest spreads across valley floors, which rise to snow peaks. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
CALEB wakes abruptly - 
- to find himself in the front seat of a helicopter. 
The pilot, JAY, is a man in his forties. 
Outside the window is the mountain landscape. 
CALEB How long was I out? 
JAY You fell asleep almost as soon as we left the airport. 
CALEB looks around.   Wipes sleep out of his eyes.   Gets his bearings. 
CALEB Damn. Can't believe I've been missing this. I was so psyched to be coming here, I was awake all night. 
JAY smiles. 
JAY You're a programmer, right? 
CALEB Yeah. 
JAY Bay facility? 
CALEB Long Island. I work on algorithms for the search engine. 
JAY Algorithms. Nice. 
CALEB You know what they are? 
JAY Nope. But I knew you were a programmer. Soon as I set eyes on you. 
CALEB Is that a good thing? 
JAY Means you and Mr Bateman speak the same language. I'd say that's a good thing. 
Beat. 
CALEB I guess you know him pretty well. 
The pilot laughs. 
JAY I've never even met him. I only fly this shuttle between the airport and his residence. (MORE) JAY (CONT'D) I did see him one time. Stood on one of these mountain ridges. 
JAY shrugs. 
JAY (CONT'D) Assume it was him, anyway. No one else around for a hundred miles. 
JAY glances over at CALEB. 
JAY (CONT'D) So how does a programmer from Long Island get to be meeting the CEO? 
CALEB I won a competition. It was kind of like a lottery, for employees. The winner got to spend a week with him. 
JAY The president can't get Mr Bateman on the phone, but you got the golden ticket. 
CALEB Yep. 
JAY Hell of an opportunity. 
CALEB Believe me. I know it. 
CALEB looks out of the window. 
CALEB (CONT'D) Incredible here. 
JAY Alaska.   Most beautiful place on Earth. 
Beat. 
CALEB How long until we get to his estate? 
JAY chuckles. 
JAY We've been flying over his estate for the past two hours. 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY 
The helicopter flies over a vast white glacier. 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY 
CUT 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY 
The helicopter flies over the lip of a WATERFALL, revealing a valley. 
The valley floor is a forest, and a single bright green meadow. Sunlit, like a jewel in the icy mountains.

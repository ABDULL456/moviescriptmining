{"train": "He nods, head down.  He doesn't want eye contact. \nREED Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and -- \nSUE I was talking about us.  Working together. \nSue holds her eyes on Reed.  He is clearly uncomfortable in her gaze.  Did the elevator just get smaller? \nREED (thinking, talking fast) Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho-- \nSUE (droll, a little annoyed) Right.  That's exactly what I meant. \nShe shakes her head -- same old Reed.  He looks at her -- what did he say wrong?  Ben smiles, patting Reed on the shoulder. \nBEN Way to not overthink it. (to Sue) So when do we leave? \nSUE I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew. \nShe offers a business card.  Reed doesn't take it. \nREED I, uh, think I remember the number. \nSUE It's been changed. \nBeat.  Ben grimaces.  Reed takes the card, his eyes down. \nREED As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission -- \nSUE Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny... \nOff Ben's curdling smile, we DISSOLVE TO -- \nEXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY \nA helicopter shot through trees.  We soar over timberland, and find something massive looming on the horizon: \nA SPACECRAFT.  A sleek take on a space shuttle.  Modern tech combined with industrial design that NASA could never afford. The craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch. WORKERS IN JUMPSUITS are scattered around the two-hundred foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks. \nEXT. GANTRY OVERLOOK - DAY \nBen stares up at the craft.  A sneer on his face. \nBEN Can't do it.  I cannot do it. \nREED External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in -- \nBEN No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator. \nREED Youthful high spirits. \nThey walk toward the base of the scaffolding. \nBEN They crashed it into a wall.  A flight simulator. \nREED I'm sure he's matured since then. \nCLOSE on JOHNNY STORM, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead. PULL BACK TO REVEAL he's riding a MOTORCYCLE, and she's driving a red CORVETTE with license plate: FRANKIE.  PICK UP Reed and Ben, watching through binoculars. \nREED (CONT'D) When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do? \nBEN Five times. \nREED I had it at four. \nBEN This makes five. \nINT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT \nReed and Ben unpack gear into lockers.  Suddenly -- \nJOHNNY (O.S.) Captain on the bridge! \nBen goes to attention on reflex: Johnny snaps a picture with a digital camera.  Then advances, as Ben realizes who it is... \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) Digital camera: $254.  Memory stick: $59.  The look on your hard-ass former CO's grill when he finds out he's your junior officer: priceless. \nBen eyeballs Johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him. Johnny flinches.  But Ben just reaches for Johnny's zipper, adjusts his uniform. \nBEN I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them? \nSUE Victor did. \nSue enters, wearing her blue, wetsuit-like uniform, carrying a stack of flightsuits.  She hands them out to the guys. \nSUE (CONT'D) The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to -- \nJOHNNY Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool! \nREED Wow.  Fantastic. \nReed stares at Sue in the skintight outfit.  She wonders, maybe hopes -- is he actually checking her out? \nREED (CONT'D) Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this. \nSUE Great minds think alike. \nVictor, annoyed by the indecisiveness, marches right up to Sue.  Practically shoves her aside as he hits the INTERCOM. \nVICTOR Reed, you need to get up here so we can close the shields!  Now! \nSue glares at Victor.  His lack of compassion shocks her. \nREED (ON RADIO) Not until Ben is back inside! \nVICTOR It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us. \nVictor doesn't bother to wait for a response.  He takes over the console, punching keys. \nSUE What are you doing? \nVICTOR Raising the shields. \nSUE You can't leave them out there. \nSue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster. \nVICTOR Watch me.  Reed had his chance.  You can't help them any more than I can. \nBeat.  She takes a step toward the door.  Not sure what to do. \nSUE I can try. \nWith one final glare, she bolts from the room. \nINT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME \nReed bites his lip.  Thinks.  He decides. \nREED Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields. \nJOHNNY What about you? \nOne look from Reed tells Johnny, he won't leave without Ben. Johnny eyes Ben, steels his courage.  He's not going either. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) (to Ben) Come on big guy, you can do it! \nINT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY \nVictor watches the shields slide down.  Alone.  An island. \nAUTOMATED VOICE Event threshold in thirty seconds. \nINT. SPACE STATION - CORRIDOR - SAME TIME \nSue races down the hall.  Not panicked.  With determination. \nEXT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY \nThe exterior air lock door slides open.  In agonizing, weightless slow motion Ben reaches to haul himself inside. \nThe leading edge of the cloud hits: Ben is pelted by a hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange stains.  Larger particles, small pellets, pepper him.  Ben hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether. \nINT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK/COMMAND CENTER - DAY \nAUTOMATED VOICE Event threshold in ten seconds. TEN... \nJohnny punches controls to close the exterior airlock door... \nReed opens a first aid kit, grabs a thermo-elastic blanket... \nINT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME \nClutching the diamond ring, Victor stands defiantly.  Showing absolutely no concern for the others.  Interested only in the event itself.  Lights and equipment FALL, CRASHING around him. \nA control panel EXPLODES in Victor's face.  He jumps back, and into the falling equipment.  Collapses under the weight. \nINT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - SAME TIME \nSue rounds a corner, sees Reed and Johnny. \nSUE Johnny!  Reed! \nAUTOMATED VOICE FIVE...FOOOOUUUR... \nSLOW MOTION: Everyone frozen in position as: \n-- JOHNNY is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel. -- REED REACHES out for Ben and the airlock door. -- VAPOR STREAM pours down on Sue from a blown gasket. -- THE SPACE DUST burns into Ben's skin. \nSLOW MOTION: Just BEFORE the exterior air-lock door closes, a SINGLE PARTICLE zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben in the back, ripping through his suit.  The exterior door shuts and seals.  The station loses all power.  DARKNESS. \nEXT. SPACE STATION - DAY \nAs quickly as it came, the cloud passes on and whirls away, leaving the space station intact.  Power quietly flickers on. \nSilence.  Time resumes.  All four pick up exactly where they left off, unaware of anything that just happened to them. \nINT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY \nVictor emerges from the rubble.  He stands, checks his body. A few scrapes, nothing serious.  A thin, throbbing CUT on his head.  He touches the wound, but it is not bleeding. \nINT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY \nReed exits, dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash. \nSue opens one eye, as the big lilies land by the bed. \nINT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nA SEXY NURSE wheels a testing station into Johnny's room. He's stripped down to Calvins, changing into a ski outfit. \nSEXY NURSE And where do we think we're going? \nJOHNNY I don't know if \"we've\" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window -- \nNURSE I've noticed... But doctor's orders, you're not allowed to leave until we -- \nJOHNNY Finish the tests, I know -- could you give me a hand with this zipper? \nNURSE You know this is not a ski resort. \nJOHNNY Not yet. \nJohnny opens the cardboard box, revealing a colorful fiberglass object the size of a briefcase.  In the blink of an eye, he unfolds it into a LONG SNOWBOARD. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) Luckily grandma still sends care packages. \nThe nurse pops a thermometer in his mouth to shut him up. \nNURSE You are trouble. \nJOHNNY (thermometer in his mouth) Brubbles my Triddle Name. \nThey both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital read-out: it runs right up past 98.6, then accelerates fast. \nSEXY NURSE You're hot! \nJOHNNY So are you! \nSEXY NURSE I mean, you feel a little feverish. \nJOHNNY I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work? \nSEXY NURSE My shift ends at four, but I couldn't -- \nJOHNNY Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up. \nHe hands her the thermometer, a quick kiss and he's out the door.  The machine beeps: Johnny's temperature is 209 DEGREES. \nEXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL PATIO - DAY \nBen finds Reed on a patio with a panoramic view.  Reed works at a laptop computer. \nBEN How long was I out? \nREED Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling? \nBEN Solid. \nBen can see Reed doesn't look too solid. \nBEN (CONT'D) How you doing? \nReed shakes his head, looking back at his screen. \nREED I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers. \nBEN Reed.  Even you can't compute every little thing. \nREED I should have done more, run more tests -- \nBen gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen. \nBEN It was a freak of nature.  Last I checked, you don't have a crystal ball.  Let it go. \nReed considers.  But he can't let it go.  He opens his computer back up, returning to work.  Ben shakes his head, looks out at the view.  His eyes catch on something, wheels turning. \nBEN (CONT'D) You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life. \nREED Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect -- \nBEN Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie. \nReed follows Ben's eyes to a lower level patio: SUE. \nREED What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor -- \nBEN I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws? \nREED He's smart, powerful, successful -- \nBEN Well maybe you should date him. \nReed looks at Ben, resigned. \nREED Ben.  He'll give her the life she deserves.  She ended up with the right guy.  Things worked out for the best. \nReed steps away.  Ben stands alone, an idea sparking. \nBEN (CONT'D) Hey Reed, what are you doing here? (before he can answer) Great, why don't you join us? \nHe quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table. Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it. \nBEN (CONT'D) God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the buffet. \nBen's stomach growls again, even louder this time. \nINT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING \nThe sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners.  The room is darker, more romantic.  Ben finishes the last shrimp on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously. \nBEN Pardon me... \nSue and Reed stare at him.  Ben's stomach growls again. \nREED Are you alright? \nBEN I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp. \nThis was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well, unsteady when he walks away.  He looks down at his stomach. \nBEN (CONT'D) Really bad shrimp. \nANGLE: Fireplace.  Sue looks gorgeous in the light.  A beat. A long beat.  Reed doesn't know where to start with this woman. \nREED Feeling better? \nSUE Yes, thanks. \nREED That's good.  That's uh...good. \nSUE You always had a way with words. (an awkward beat) I should be getting back. \nSue gets up to leave.  Exasperated, Reed tries to think of something, anything, to say. \nREED I'm really happy for you and Victor. \nShe slows down, looking at him.  She was hoping for more. \nSUE You're happy for me and Victor. \nREED I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship -- \nSUE Which was? \nREED Passion. \nWe see surprise on Sue's face, and... \nREED (CONT'D) For science. \nSUE (frustrated) You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics. \nAs if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around her BENDS.  The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze. \nREED What?  What did I say? \nShe looks more disappointed than angry. \nSUE It's never what you say.  It's what you don't say. What you don't do... \nShe lets that hang.  A lot of history here.  Quiet, hurt -- she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion. \nREED I...I...I just wanted to -- \nAs Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears. \nSUE It's been two years, and all you can say is you're happy for me and some other guy... (standing up, hurt) You know, Victor may be a lot of things, but at least he's not afraid to fight for what he wants... (Reed looks down) And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. To be heard...seen... Reed, look at me. \nHe looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her cheek and her bewitching eyes.  He drops his fork, shocked. \nREED Uh, Sue...?  I can't. \nSUE What?  What do you mean you -- \nREED Sue...look at your hands. \nShe raises her hands, but we don't see them.  We only see a medical waistband...floating.  Her watch...floating.  Her clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air. \nSue is invisible.  She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a GLASS off the table... \nSLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits -- \nThen snaps back into place.  Reed stares at his arm in disbelief.  Sue's eyes widen as well.  The rest of Sue reappears.  They look at each other: mutual alarm. \nJOHNNY (O.S.) You guys will not believe what just happened! \nThey look up to see JOHNNY in the doorway, NAKED except for the nurse's PINK PARKA wrapped around his midsection. \nINT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING \nCLUNK.  The candles burn low on the table.  Victor strides out, heading for the door.  He runs his hand through his hair to comb some strays.  A CLUMP comes off in his fingers.  He PAUSES.  He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair.  His SCAR. \nIt is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD).  Victor peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray. Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected... \nREED He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one. \nSUE We need to find him. \nVictor redirects his attention to Sue. \nSUE (CONT'D) Victor, I'm sorry I -- \nVICTOR (cold) Just find him. \nVictor strides off, leaving the others. \nJOHNNY Anybody know where the big guy's going? \nWe PUSH IN on a picture of Debbie lying on the floor, Reed knows exactly where Ben is going. \nREED He's going home. \nEXT. TRAIN YARD - NIGHT \nA view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance. CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo trains.  We PUSH IN on the main track, where... \nA CARGO TRAIN has just stopped.  We hear a cargo DOOR slide open, then WHUMP!  Big FEET hit the ground.  Someone, or someTHING barrels into the night. \nEXT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT \nA locked storefront on Flatbush Ave.  SOUND of breaking glass. \nINT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT \nSERIES OF SHOTS: Ben tries on clothes, shoes.  Jackets rip, shoes split.  He needs an extra extra extra large. \nEXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT \nA HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow.  It's Ben. \nCLOSE ON: The dial pad.  Big fingers try to push keys but they're too large.  Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more and more frustrated.  He manages to press \"0\" with his pinky. \nBEN Hello, Operator? \nBen looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a modest, working-class home.  His eyes go soft when he sees Debbie grab the phone. \nBEN (CONT'D) Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front. \nDEBBIE Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you. \nHe blinks hard.  Sad, dark. \nBEN I got a surprise for you too. \nEXT. BROOKLYN HOUSE - NIGHT \nDebbie steps out.  There is \"WELCOME HOME\" sign over the door.  She looks out.  The wind blows softly.  Something shifts in the darkness.  Debbie pulls her robe tighter. \nDEBBIE Ben? \nBEN (O.S.) Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said \"together forever no matter what\"? \nDEBBIE Baby, you're scaring me. \nA hanging beat.  And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY. \nDebbie sees him.  Fear washes over her, not sure what to think.  He reaches out, a little tentative.  She flinches back. \nDEBBIE Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben? \nBEN Deb, it's me.  It's still me. \nHe reaches out.  She recoils.  It's too much for her.  Tears swell in her eyes.  Covering her mouth, she backs away. \nHe takes a step closer.  She backs away faster, tripping over her robe, falling into the street.  A car screeches to a halt.  Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries back. \nDEBBIE Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME! \nHer shout wakes NEIGHBORS.  Lights flicker on.  Ben knows he has to go.  He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time he'll see her.  She trembles, terrified.  His eyes go moist. \nBEN I love you, Deb. \nWith that, he turns away.  The \"WELCOME HOME\" sign flutters, falls to the ground.  A tragic tableau.  As more lights go on around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn. \nINT. VICTOR'S COMPOUND OFFICE - DAY \nVictor packs a monogrammed Armani briefcase: \"VDM\" emblazoned on a gold plate.  Leonard waits not-so-patiently. \nVICTOR Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press. \nLEONARD Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal -- \nVICTOR Front page? \nLEONARD Top left, like you asked. (a smile) Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington. \nVictor turns to Leonard, disappointed with him. \nVICTOR Leonard.  Think bigger. \nHe motions to her body.  She understands.  She concentrates, and starts to turn invisible. \nBRIDGE COP #1 What the hell is this?  A magic show? \nBut her clothes don't go invisible.  Beat.  Reed mutters: \nREED Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them. \nSUE What...? (realizes) Oh. \nShe unbuttons her blouse.  Not thrilled with the idea.  She wriggles out of her pants.  Down to her skivvies.  She reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses concentration and becomes visible.  The sight of Sue in her undies grabs the COPS' attention.  Everyone watches, stunned. \nThe realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of bricks.  Cops are transfixed.  So is Reed. \nJOHNNY This is wrong in so many ways. \nREED You've been working out. \nSUE Shut up. \nSue takes a deep breath.  Closes her eyes.  Focuses.  Nothing happens.  She's embarrassed and furious. \nSUE (CONT'D) Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you should strip down next, see how it feels to have fifty people staring -- \n...and she DISAPPEARS.  Entirely.  Undies float.  Jaws drop. \nREED Uh, Sue? \nShe stops ranting.  Realizes she's gone invisible. \nSUE (INVISIBLE) Oh.  Well then... \nThe undies drop.  The cops stare open-mouthed.  They turn to look at Reed, astonished.  He sheepishly shrugs his shoulders. \nJOHNNY I'm gonna need serious therapy. \nA beat.  She walks away.  The cops watch her, gaping.  By the time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone, disappearing into the clouds of smoke. \nEXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY \nA news CHOPPER flies around the bridge, fighting for the best angle on the action. \nEXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - ACCIDENT - DAY \nReed races through wreckage.  He tries to see over a big TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES! \nHe finally sees...BEN.  Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO! His face snakes right in front of Ben.  Ben jumps. \nBEN What the --! \nREED Ben.  Are you okay? \nBEN Am I okay?!  You wanna explain that?! \nHe motions to Reed's neck.  Then to his own body: \nBEN (CONT'D) Or this?!  What the hell am I? 'Cause I sure ain't Ben anymore. \nReed opens his mouth, but he has no answer.  Not yet. \nSUE (O.S.) REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT! \nBen spins, looking for Sue.  He can't see her.  But he does see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING! \nBOOOOM!  The first car BLOWS!  BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM!  Empty cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.  The flames are mushrooming! \nReed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.  His arms FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin. \nFLAMES lash out.  A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream. Johnny LEAPS toward them.  His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women, SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile. \nSue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).  The air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS. \nShe looks at them, surprised, confused.  Her invisible fields SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.  But the flames hurtle closer.  She fights the pressure.  Blood trickles from her nose.  Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her... \nSue is dressed again.  Visible.  She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!  She collapses, as the blast deflects off the street and into... \nAn oncoming FIRETRUCK!  BOOOOM!  The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.  Brakes scream.  Its tail slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail. \nTHE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE WATER!  FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.  The truck TEETERS, falling!  Ben wastes no time.  He GRABS onto the front of the truck, just as it goes off the side! \nHe DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across the concrete, digging grooves into the street. \nON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward the bridge.  Their truck SWINGS.  Bits and pieces tumble down at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.  All deadly now.  The HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT! \nBen SCREAMS!  STRAINING with all his might.  Ben SCREAMS! His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back. Another scream.  Another step.  Another.  Another.  Epic, painful. \nHe is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. His footsteps THUD.  With monumental effort, he levels the truck.  Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing over Ben. \nReed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.  Ben steps back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.  Wary cops close in to cover him with weapons, but... \nThe FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.  The crowd of onlookers joins in as well.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised, touched by the reaction.  But Ben seems uncomfortable. \nFiremen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats; he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue. \nEXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY \nReed, Sue, and Ben get up to go.  The press waits a beat, then surges.  Ben spins, holding up one finger.  A giant. \nBEN Be nice. \nThe press step back, intimidated.  Flashbulbs POP, and Ben's FACE FREEZES.  It goes BLACK-AND-WHITE on a NEW YORK POST in -- \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nEstablishing shot of a historic New York building. \nINT. BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nBANKERS sit around a table.  LAPTOPS hum.  The lead banker is power-broker NED CECIL.  The men keep their eyes on Victor. \nNED CECIL Well, Victor, the bank would like to congratulate you.  On the fastest freefall since the Depression.  We can't even give your stock away. \nVICTOR Ned, you know I can turn this around. \nNed motions to the paper, the picture of BEN. \nNED CECIL You promised a cure-all, and came back with this.  Who the hell's going to invest in a biotech company that turns its workers into circus freaks? \nVictor's grip tightens around the table, and...the LAPTOPS FLICKER, losing feeds. \nVictor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did I do that?)  He lets go of the table; screens go back to normal. \nVICTOR (pointed) I really appreciate all your support. \nNED CECIL You've got a week, Victor.  One week to turn this around.  Or we pull out... (a beat) This meeting is over. \nVictor looks at him, blood boiling, and we CUT HARD TO -- \nINT. BANK - HALLWAY - DAY \nVictor and Leonard stride out.  Victor is writhing. \nVICTOR Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know preferred stock from livestock. \nLeonard is thinking all business. \nLEONARD Sir.  Reed's comments at that press conference killed us.  How are we going to turn this around? \nVictor considers.  His mind races, eyes narrow. \nVICTOR Very simple.  I cure them.  If I can cure these freaks, then I can cure anyone.  What better way to restore my reputation? \nLeonard nods, impressed.  Victor is a man in motion.  As they step into sunlight, we cut to...CLICKCLICKCLICK in -- \nEXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY \nREPORTERS snap pictures.  A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping in front of a towering HIGH-RISE.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny and get out of a police-car. Ben steps out of a BIG PADDY-WAGON, which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle position. \nCOPS hold back the surging press.  Ben keeps his head down, self-conscious.  He passes Johnny, smiling for the cameras. \nJOHNNY Smile, Ben.  They want to like you. Give 'em your good side.  Or your less bad side. \nBen turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS.  Stiff, tentative: \nBEN Uh...don't do drugs. \nThe kids FLINCH.  Ben trudges on.  Johnny smiles bright, doing hand-signs for F4.  Sue pulls him toward -- \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY \nThe Fantastic Four enter.  They are greeted by JIMMY O'HOOLIHAN, an old-time doorman with a kind smile. \nO'HOOLIHAN Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards.  All that for you? \nHe motions to the flashing cameras outside. \nREED I'm afraid so... \nHe searches for the name.  Sue steps up. \nSUE Jimmy.  Good to see you again. \nHe smiles at Sue, then at Reed. \nO'HOOLIHAN Good to see you too... Don't worry, sir.  I know how crowded that head of yours is. \nREED Any visitors while I was away? \nO'HOOLIHAN Just the usual.  Told 'em you were circling round outer space. \nHe opens a drawer full of LETTERS from the BANK.  Reed looks sheepish.  He shuts the drawer, looks to Johnny and Sue. \nREED We had a tough year. \nBEN Yeah, nine years straight. \nReed looks at Ben.  Thanks a lot.  DING.  Elevator doors open. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY \nThey enter.  Reed hits the top button, for the 20TH FLOOR. \nReed looks at his hand.  Shakes his wrist.  He looks at Victor. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALL - DAY \nVictor moves fast, holds tight to his anger.  Reed catches up. \nREED Victor wait... I just wanted to say, I'm sorry the mission didn't go as planned -- \nVictor suddenly WHEELS on Reed.  Lights flicker. \nVICTOR Didn't go as planned?  It was a catastrophe.  You ruined the lives of four people -- \nREED I ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort -- \nVICTOR Abort?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool -- \nREED Victor, if we could understand what happened to us -- \nVICTOR I don't want to understand it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to fix it.  Fast! \nReed sees Victor's SCAR maybe growing.  Lights dim. \nVOICE (O.S.) There a problem, Vic? \nThey turn to see...BEN down the hall, leaning in a doorway. Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body. \nVICTOR No problem, Ben. \nHe turns back to Reed.  Close, quiet.  Lights flicker. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Just pay your goddamn electric bill, and get to work on a cure. \nVictor steps away, toward the elevator.  He passes Ben, who just smiles and waves \"goodbye.\"  Before Victor's finger taps the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit responded to him).  Reed exhales, shaken.  Victor steps into -- \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY \nThe doors close, and Victor really LETS LOOSE.  He SLAMS his fist into a STEEL WALL.  The wall BUCKLES, steel DENTING. \nVictor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling METALLIC SHELL under the skin.  He stares at it in horror.  The dark surface pulsates with electric energy.  What is he becoming...? \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY \nSue works the controls.  Reed approaches Ben with an ELECTRODE NEEDLE.  He tries to stick the needle into Ben, but it SNAPS. \nBEN You got a chisel round here? \nREED If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes. \nBen looks to Sue for translation. \nSUE We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped. \nBEN Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something? \nReed shakes his head.  He approaches with an X-RAY MACHINE. \nREED No, just sit back.  We have a good sense of your strength from the firetruck.  We need to find the source of your strength. \nHe turns on the X-ray machine.  The graph shows SOLID ROCK. The rays don't penetrate.  Sue and Reed look confused. \nBEN How bad is it?  You know I used to smoke. \nReed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too short to wrap around Ben's arm.  Reed stands stumped.  He looks at his tray full of instruments.  He picks up the little rubber REFLEX-HAMMER.  But it looks miniscule compared to Ben. \nReed has an idea.  He opens a drawer full of HARDWARE TOOLS. He pulls of a real HAMMER.  He approaches Ben. \nREED Okay, this might smart a little. \nHe taps Ben's knee lightly, and BEN'S LEG KICKS!  SLAMMING UP!  RIGHT BETWEEN REED'S LEGS!  The ultimate kick in the crotch.  Reed STRETCHES UP a few feet, then SNAPS BACK, wincing. \nREED (CONT'D) (high-pitched voice) We'll...continue this later. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY \nFrom their second level control room, Reed and Sue observe Johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber.  Flames escape through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched! \nReed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000 degrees Kelvin.  They are essentially taking his temperature. \nINSIDE THE CHAMBER: Johnny turns white hot, blinding to look at: the chamber walls begin to glow red.  Machines go haywire. \nHis feet even start to LIFT OFF THE GROUND, LEVITATING a foot or two.  He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter. \nREED Back it down, Johnny! \nJOHNNY I can go hotter! \nHe won't stop.  Reed pulls a switch on the wall.  FOAM sprays out of nozzles, dousing Johnny's flames.  He stands there, covered in thick FOAM.  His body steams.  So does his temper. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) You're really cramping my style here. \nSUE You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova -- \nJOHNNY Sweet. \nSUE That's the temperature of the sun. \nREED I think it was a little more complicated than -- \nSUE I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that? \nThe question stumps him.  A beat.  He struggles. \nREED There were a lot of variables to consider -- \nSUE No.  There weren't.  There was you. And me.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does. \nHer words penetrate.  He knows she's right.  He looks away. \nREED Sue...I just...I thought... \nHe struggles for the words. \nSUE Same old Reed.  Too much thinking... \nHe opens his mouth, but...WHAM!  Doors open.  Johnny enters, wearing a CHARRED SHIRT.  He points to the burned scraps of his shirt. \nJOHNNY Okay guys, we have a serious problem. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY \nANGLES of Reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from various closets/containers: \nREED (V.O.) Our uniforms were exposed to the storm like us.  So they can transform like us, becoming invisible, changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame. \nREVEAL: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at themselves in a mirror wearing the uniforms.  No boots, no gloves.  Not yet.  (The uniforms will develop, like our heroes). \nBEN You look like an eighties rock band. \nSUE (to Ben) The suit will stretch.  You should try it -- \nBEN I wouldn't be caught dead in that. \nJOHNNY He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it -- \nREED They're not costumes. \nSUE We're not taking them out.  Johnny, we need to stay here till we've stabilized. \nJohnny shakes his head, frustrated. \nJOHNNY I'm getting sick of being trapped here.  NASA wasn't even this strict! \nHe marches out.  Sue turns to Reed, who says nothing.  Sue heads out, leaving Ben and Reed.  A beat.  Ben looks at Reed. \nBEN (looking at uniform) Maybe it's missing a utility belt. \nOff Reed's dark look, we hear: \nVICTOR (V.O.) So what's the prognosis? \nINT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nCLOSE ON: an X-RAY.  Victor's ARM.  The metallic transformation is higher now.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor and his DOCTOR.  In the wall behind them: ancient armor (maybe we noticed it before, maybe not).  It adds a little menace to the room. \nDOCTOR Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow -- \nVICTOR And they're changing into... \nDOCTOR I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds -- \nVICTOR Like the shields Reed said would protect us. (cold fury, deadly focus) How long? \nDOCTOR At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks -- \nVICTOR What do you mean \"complete\"? \nDOCTOR I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and -- \nVictor hardens, razor sharp. \nVICTOR What? \nDOCTOR The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious -- \nWHHM!  Victor GRABS the Doctor by the throat. \nVICTOR Look at me.  I have a life.  I'm the face of a billion-dollar-company... We need to keep this confidential, understand? \nVictor's grip TIGHTENS around the man's throat. \nDOCTOR But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative... \nVICTOR That's terrible news... \nWith one cobra-swift move, Victor thrusts his metallic arm into the doctor, killing him instantly.  Victor retracts his arm, and looks at it, shocked by his own strength. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) ...but I think I'll get a second opinion. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nA SERIES OF TIME-LAPSE SHOTS: REED works around the Baxter Building, spending hours searching for the cure.  He checks charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated. \nVictor opens a drawer, pulls out an old VIDEOTAPE. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) And get this over to Ben Grimm. \nVictor leans forward, fixated on that machine.  As he gets closer, his screens go STATICKY.  He absentmindedly picks at his SCAR.  In shadows, we see skin peeling off. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) Close your eyes, baby.  Keep 'em closed. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT \nBEN GRIMM stands front and center.  Not the Thing.  But BEN GRIMM.  A normal man.  He smiles wide, shaking his head. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) You surprised? \nNow we PULL BACK to reveal DEBBIE and BEN on a SCREEN.  The Thing watches the old videotape.  He smiles sadly at his old life.  He mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart. \nBEN (ON SCREEN) Yeah I'm surprised.  Surprised the fire department didn't shut this down. \nON SCREEN: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a SURPRISE PARTY.  Full of people.  Ben Grimm is a popular guy. On screen: Reed hugs Ben.  They pose for pictures together. \nTHE THING God.  I was good looking. \nWe hear the party sing \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY.\"  Debbie kisses Ben. Thing's eyes start to mist.  On screen: Ben blows out candles. \nDEBBIE (ON SCREEN) What did you wish for, honey? \nBEN (ON SCREEN) I already got it.  Everything I want. \nAs they kiss, a tear runs down Thing's cheek.  The tape ends, and he sits in darkness for a beat.  A long, lonely beat. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLS - NIGHT \nBen stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat. As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight: \nREED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall.  His ARM is STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner.  Ben just shakes his head, keeps moving.  And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM... \nUP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL.  The muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut.  Finally, we reach... \nREED.  He steps slowly.  He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in his other hand, measuring distance.  His skin STREEETCHES. His face tightens, pained.  We hear the faint SQUEAK of his skin. \nVOICE (O.S.) Damn, Stretch! \nReed turns his head around, seeing JOHNNY come down the hall. \nJOHNNY How far's that rubber bend? \nReed keeps moving, slowly.  His muscles and tendons laboring. \nREED That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to -- \nJOHNNY Right, whatever, have fun. \nAnd Johnny is GONE, ducking under Reed's arm into -- \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJohnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some JIFFY POP.  It starts to POP in his hand, the bag swelling.  He casually turns on a TV, flipping to...the X- GAMES.  The Jiffy Pop swells, ready to blow.  He rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the games: \nCool stunts, hot girls.  Johnny's brow furrows, a thought forming, a mischievous smile on his lips. \nEXT. BAXTER BUILDING - SIDE EXIT - NIGHT \nA FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora. Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO -- \nEXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT \nDark.  Lights flicker.  Steam rises through the grates.  A shadow emerges.  Ben.  He heads toward O'DONNEL'S PUB, a classic Brooklyn tavern.  Neon sign.  Music, life inside. Ben pulls his hat low, turns up his collar, and squeezes through the door into -- \nINT. O'DONNEL'S PUB - NIGHT \nA big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a place over the bar.  Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT.  He moves through the crowd.  People clear out of the way. \nBen reaches the bar.  He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH!  SMASH! The stool SNAPS like a toothpick.  He hits the ground hard. Glasses shake.  A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly. \nBEN That's not funny! \nThey go silent.  They drop bills onto tables, filing out, scared of this monster.  ERNIE works the bar. \nERNIE Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first mook from Brooklyn to go to outer space, so pay him some respect! \nBut the patrons keep filing out.  Ben looks down, weary. \nBEN Ernie.  Sorry for killing your business.  I'll take the usual, then I'm out... Better make it a double. \nErnie heads for the booze.  Ben gives a sad shake of his head.  Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the bar.  A beautiful young woman nursing a drink.  Meet ALICIA MASTERS. \nALICIA Who killed the party? \nShe turns to him, unafraid.  He notices her blank stare, lack of focus, and white cane.  Alicia is blind. \nERNIE (O.S.) Make it a triple.  On the house, Benny. \nBen takes his drink, but SMASH!  His grip shatters the glass, spilling all over himself.  He smiles ruefully. \nBEN If there's a God, she hates me. \nJOHNNY Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I'm a big fan. \nRonnie gives a tight nod.  He doesn't like being upstaged by this circus freak. \nThe other bikers approach. \nKENNY BARTRAM Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take her for a spin? \nHe motions to his BIKE.  Johnny eyes this mean machine. \nRONNIE RENNER Come on, bro.  I'll teach you some tricks...if you can keep up. \nWe PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO -- \nINT. NYC ARENA - TRACK - DAY \nRonnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny. Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with the number \"004\" on the back and a small 4 over his heart. Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH! \nX GAMES ANNOUNCER A rock-solid double-flip! \nThe CROWD goes wild.  Now it's Johnny's turn.  He hits the hill and pulls the exact same move.  With even more height! \nX GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Look at that lift, ladies and gentlemen! \nJohnny sticks the landing.  The crowd swells.  Ronnie tightens, pulls his throttle harder, taking the next jump, and...MAKING AN INSANE MOVE, CORKSCREWING IN THE AIR! \nX GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Frontside 360!  He's totally flat and whipped! \nHe lands clean.  The crowd is ready to explode.  Johnny REVS his engine, his body starting to STEAM, adrenaline burning. He hits the hill, and pulls an even gnarlier SPIN! \nX GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Whoa!  That's a...what is that?  A \nJohnny lands.  The crowd roars.  Ronnie bears down on the last hill.  He leans over his handlebars. \nX GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) He's going for a Kiss of Death! \nRonnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING STUNT!  The crowd is deafening!  Ronnie smiles.  And... \nJOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER.  Trails of FLAME start to streak off his back!  He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL! LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS!  SPINNING LIKE A TOP!  A FLAMING BLUR! \nAnd now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING!  He FLAMES ON, spiraling upward!  For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying. \nX GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) (hand over mic) Is he......flying? \nA beat.  Time suspended.  And...WHHM!  He PLUMMETS back down! LANDS on his bike in mid-air!  And sticks a perfect landing, maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie.  Johnny swerves to a stop, with a \"holy shit\" look on his face.  What the hell just happened?? \nX GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! You've just seen the first...the first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH! \nA new name is born.  The crowd goes berserk.  Standing ovation.  Riders rush up to Johnny.  Kenny sees his bike: \nTHE SEAT MELTED, WHEELS BURNED OFF.  Johnny smiles. \nJOHNNY My bad.  Sorry about that. (a glance to Ronnie) Thanks for the lesson, bro. \nHOT GIRLS swarm.  As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - MORNING \nSue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail.  She focuses on one piece of mail that she's holding.  Her hand begins to disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as well.  Sue smiles at the success.  Intrigued.  Quiet: \nSUE That's new... \nReed enters -- overworked, unshaved.  He keeps his head down, preoccupied.  Sue shifts focus. \nSUE (CONT'D) Have you read these...?  From all over.  People want us to fight crimes... save their kids...solve their problems... (no response from Reed) ...when we can't even solve our own. \nShe puts the letters down, steps closer to Reed. \nSUE (CONT'D) Reed.  How close are we to a cure? \nREED No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments. \nShe considers.  Victor's words echo in her head. \nSUE We're not specimens, we're patients. This isn't just another science project to you, is it...? \nReed looks up, a little surprised.  He opens his mouth, but -- \nBEN (O.S.) NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!! \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - DAY \nCRASH!  BANG!  Ben stalks around the room, furious.  Reed and Sue rush in. \nREED BEN!  What?  What's going on!? \nBen points to the wall-sized TV: the ESPN MOTO X GAMES. \nX GAMES REPORTER (ON TV) So what can you tell us about the outfit? \nREVEAL: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER.  He is peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit, revealing his FF UNIFORM, with a \"4\" STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST. \nBehind them, STEP UP RIDERS launch their MOTO-BIKES off huge 18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air. \nJOHNNY (ON TV) Not too much, but I will say that it's all weather and no leather.  Kind of Armani meets Astronaut. \nBen reels back a FIST the size of an anvil.  Stops himself. Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off. \nJohnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the head.  Ben stops.  Turns around more shocked than hurt. \nBEN Did you just -- \nBen gets hit with ANOTHER FIREBALL.  This time in the face. \nBEN (CONT'D) Okay, that's it, tinkerbell!  You want to fly?  Fly. \nBen charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps in the way!  Too late!  WHAMM!  Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS.  Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet. \nBAM!  Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side.  WHOOSH!  He leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty. \nThe crowd stands stunned.  So do Reed and Sue.  Cameras pop. \nJohnny slowly pulls himself up.  The paint on the truck begins to bubble around his hand.  Beaten, bruised, he stands.  Heating up.  Both his hands are now flaming fists of fury. \nJOHNNY Let's see if we can get blood from a stone. \nHe and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them. High Noon.  They start to RUN toward each other... \nWhen they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM, stops them both in their tracks with just a look.  Like a mom: \nSUE You two need a time-out. \nJOHNNY Blockhead started it! \nBen just stalks off.  The crowd clears, scared.  A PAPARAZZI snaps a picture.  Ben GRABS his camera, and flicks the lens. \nEXT. STREETS - DAY \nSue looks at Johnny, more disappointed than angry. \nSUE Damn it, Johnny. \nShe goes after Ben, leaving Reed and Johnny on the sidewalk. \nREED You need to control yourself and think before you -- \nJOHNNY Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling? \nREED A higher calling like getting girls and making money? \nJohnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm. \nJOHNNY Is there any higher? \nReed looks at him, disgusted.  Johnny waves to the crowd, hand flaming.  People SHRIEK, snap pictures.  Johnny smiles at Reed. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) This is who we are Reed.  Accept it. Or better yet: enjoy it. \nJohnny steps into the sea of fans.  Reed stands alone. \nEXT. STREET/ALLEY - DAY \nSue wades through the throng of New Yorkers.  Tries to catch up with Ben...whose presence parts the crowd like Moses. \nSUE Ben!  Slow down... \nBen glances sideways at her, doesn't stop.  She catches up. \nSUE (CONT'D) He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead -- \nBEN It's not him.  It's them. (pointing to crowd) I can't live like this. \nSUE Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one -- \nBEN It's easy for you to be patient. \nSUE No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben. \nHe slows down, gets closer, intense. \nBEN Together?  Look at me, Susie.  You got no idea what I'd give...to be invisible.  Your nightmare...is my dream. \nShe opens her mouth, but has no response.  She doesn't know his depth of pain.  As he disappears into the alley, we CUT TO -- \nINT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe news plays on the TV.  Head Banker Ned Cecil freezes the screen on an image of...THE THING.  He turns to Victor, who sits with the rest of the bankers.  Cold, sterile environment. \nNED CECIL This is how you \"turn things around\"? These freaks are on the front page and your company's in the obituaries. \nVictor has a larger bandage on his face now. \nVICTOR I have a plan to use their publicity for -- \nNED CECIL Victor, stop.  The bank's lost enough already.  This isn't a negotiation. It's a notification.  We're pulling out. \nA cold, silent beat.  Victor leans forward. \nVICTOR You need to look long-term here. Without risk, there's no -- \nNED CECIL Reward.  We all know the sales pitch, Vic.  And frankly, we're done buying... Gentlemen. \nREED The storm needs to be handled exactly right, or it could make our mutations worse, much worse, maybe even kill us... \nVictor slows.  Is Reed getting to him?  Or giving him ideas? \nREED (CONT'D) Victor, please.  We need time to verify the data... We can't afford any mistakes -- there's only enough ions for two or three attempts. \nVictor considers.  He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle. \nVICTOR Reed.  I'm not asking permission. (a final verdict) We'll build it, while you check the specs. \nVictor walks out.  Reed looks unsure, as we CUT TO -- \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY \nThe SHIELDS slowly rise.  FIVE TECHNICIANS go to work.  They wear the VDI jackets.  Reed watches, worried. \nSue enters.  She sees the shields, the technicians, the VDI logo.  And she is deeply worried.  She steps over to Reed. Sparks fly behind them.  Drills scream. \nSUE Can I talk to you? \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - DAY \nSue steps into the office, followed by Reed.  Quiet, urgent: \nSUE Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake -- \nREED He was going to take away all my data, equipment -- \nSUE Better than your life.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  We are. \nReed starts to snap, losing his studied cool. \nREED Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable -- \nSUE Every variable but yourself.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like -- \nREED (finally losing it) I'm not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there. \nSue stands there, shocked by his outburst.  A beat. \nSUE So clear it out.  Get out of your head.  Get out of here... \nHe looks at her, knowing what she means.  Where she means. \nEXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY \nBen nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street, mind tossing and turning.  People stare, point.  A LITTLE GIRL and FRIEND run up to him. \nLITTLE GIRL Mister, Mister!  Please help me!  My kitty is stuck in a tree. \nShe gestures to a tree next to Ben.  Looks up. \nLITTLE GIRL (CONT'D) Please save Miss Lucy. \nBen rolls his eyes.  Looks up.  Considers climbing the tree, but thinks better of it.  He has another idea... \nBen grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap out of it.  MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!! \nThe cat falls into frame.  At the last instant, Ben sticks out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.  He hands the cat to the girl.  Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks. He just moves on. \nEXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT \nBen passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE SCULPTURE of his bust. \nHe stops, steps back to take a look.  It's exquisitely rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the haunting anguish in his eyes.  Ben is amazed, and touched, but... \nBEN (under breath) Eyebrows are a little big... \nA beat.  He stares at these images of himself. \nVOICE (O.S.) I figured the only way to get you here was to stick that in the window. \nHe turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway. \nBEN How'd you know it was me? \nALICIA I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in? \nHe steps toward her.  But he sees...a PARTY in the back part of the gallery.  Ben pauses, a little insecure. \nBEN I'm not really dressed for a party. \nALICIA Relax, it's casual. \nBEN No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty... \nShe smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO -- \nINT. GALLERY - STUDIO - NIGHT \nWHOOSH!  A SCULPTOR'S HOSE sprays a thin stream of water at BEN.  Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin CARVING CHISELS for his cracks.  Intricate, intimate work. \nBen enjoys every moment.  He eyes a couple, large PUPPETS in the corner. \nBEN Those yours too? \nShe knows.  He trails off.  Sue looks at him. \nREED (CONT'D) You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted. \nSUE I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted you to be that man. \nSomeone SHUSHES them.  They slump down further.  Closer. \nSUE (CONT'D) When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me. \nREED Why didn't you say something? \nSUE That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed... (closer, emotional) I'm saying it now. \nTheir eyes lock.  A heated beat.  No more secrets.  Their faces are close.  A kiss is coming.  Closer, closer.  Sue disappears. \nSUE (CONT'D) (quiet, playful) Come find me. \nReed tentatively leans into the kiss, and... \nSUE (O.S.) (CONT'D) That's my nose, genius... These are my lips. \nReed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible hands.  She pulls him into a KISS.  Lips touch.  Soft, tender.  Stars twinkle.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO -- \nEXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT \nBen and Alicia step out together.  The crowd quiets, turns. A few whispers flutter.  Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips her arm into his.  The party goes back to normal. \nALICIA Look around.  I'll get us drinks. They always let blind girls cut the line. \nShe walks off.  He watches her go.  The way her hair moves. The lines of her neck.  The light on her skin.  This woman is the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.  He's falling hard. \nBen steps through the crowd.  The swanky guests give strained smiles, polite.  Ben is starting to feel comfortable here. He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests. \nBen hangs back, happy to watch her.  A few patrons pass him, thinking he's just an inanimate statue. \nPATRON I don't know about this one.  It lacks a certain...realism. \nBen keeps his eyes on Alicia.  He overhears two BOHEMIAN GIRLS, who assume he's a statue. \nBOHEMIAN GIRL #1 She's always had a thing for runaways and strays, but this is ridiculous. \nBOHEMIAN GIRL #2 I know.  Did she really think these sculptures would sell? \nBOHEMIAN GIRL #1 Like anybody would want this thing in their house.  That girl's a one-woman charity. \nBen just stands there, frozen.  His eyes dart around the room, paranoid now.  Aware of people staring, laughing.  He glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.  Now it's damning. \nWe stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging where she left Ben.  She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for him.  But Ben is gone.  She looks disappointed, hearing his heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance. \nTHUNDER booms on the CUT TO -- \nEXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT \nA pitstop in Queens.  Heavy RAIN swims down windows.  BEN sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. Nobody sits within four chairs of him.  He sips coffee in a metal bowl.  A long beat.  Then... \nVICTOR (O.S.) This seat taken? \nBen turns to see...VICTOR. \nBEN What are you doing here? \nVICTOR I'm worried about you. \nBEN About me?  How sweet. \nVICTOR Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company. \nBen considers.  A man deeply alone.  A beat. \nINT. DINER - LATER \nVictor and Ben sit in a window booth.  A waitress sets a foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge plates he's just cleared.  Victor's aware of the other customers in the diner staring at Ben.  Ben burps: it rattles the plates. \nTHE THING 'Scuse me. \nVICTOR I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back... \nTHE THING If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job -- \nVICTOR I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back. \nThe Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth. \nTHE THING Reed's gonna fix me up -- \nVICTOR For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical. \nTHE THING Skeptical...? \nBen doesn't trust him.  But Victor is hitting pressure points. \nVICTOR Look, he's a brilliant man, we should trust he's working as hard as he can. You're his best friend.  So what possible reason could he have for taking his time? (a beat) I mean, other than getting close to Sue? \nOff The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  He can't help but find truth in the words.  And we CUT TO -- \nAnd then it's over.  The light dies down...somewhat.  It still pulses along with the chamber.  The chamber door SLIDES OPEN. \nBeat.  And...BEN GRIMM steps out.  Not The Thing.  No more rocks.  BEN GRIMM.  Naked, tired, but finally A NORMAL MAN. \nHe slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large.  He collapses.  He stares at his hands, his arms...it worked. \nBEN Oh my God... Th-thank you.  THANK YOU...VIC?! \nBen sees a SPARK in shadows.  That spark is... \nVICTOR'S ARM.  Victor steps forward, and reveals himself to Ben: ELECTRICITY PUMPS THROUGH HIS BODY.  His skin is part flesh, part metal.  Cheekbone exposed, steel tissue. \nHE IS DOOM. \nBEN (CONT'D) Vic... What the...? \nDOOM Everyone thought I was safe behind those shields... \nBEN Victor, the machine worked for me.  It can work for you -- \nDOOM It did, Ben.  It worked perfectly. \nBen starts to realize... \nBEN You planned this...? \nDoom smiles, reaches out his hand -- ELECTRICITY builds from his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips. \nDOOM I've always wanted power.  Now I've got an unlimited supply... \nBEN And no Thing to stand in your way. \nDOOM smiles, nods, stronger than Ben now. \nDOOM Take a good look, Ben.  This is what a man looks like who embraces his destiny. \nDoom clenches his fist and BLASTS Ben, sending him flying backwards across the room -- knocked unconscious. \nDOOM (CONT'D) One down, three to go. \nSuddenly, WHOOSH!  The lab door flies open.  Reed enters. Doom steps back into the shadows. \nDOOM (CONT'D) Right on cue. \nReed's eyes go wide.  He sees Ben crumpled in the corner. \nREED Oh god Ben.  Are you okay? (amazed) You did it, you really did it... \nDOOM No, Reed.  I did. \nReed slowly turns to see...DOOM.  His body, his face. \nREED Victor...?  What, what happened to you?  What did you do to your -- \nDOOM Exactly what I said I would: I built a better, stronger being.  And outsmarted the great Reed Richards -- \nREED Victor, this isn't the way to -- \nDOOM (a dark smile) You always know best.  So tell me. What happens when you superheat rubber? \nDoom BLASTS an electrical BOLT at Reed, KNOCKING Reed through the huge window!  Reed's body RUBBER-BANDS from the blast. \nEXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT \nReed SLINKIES down the face of the building, skin rippling. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT \nDoom looks out the window, smiling at his old friend's fall. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - FRONT LOBBY - NIGHT \nDING!  The elevator opens.  Doom strides out.  He passes our friend O'HOOLIHAN, who looks scared. \nO'HOOLIHAN Mr. Von Doom?  Are you oka-- \nDoom casually SWIPES, sending him through revolving doors. \nDOOM Never better, Jimmy.  And it's Doctor Doom now. \nEXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT \nReed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali watch.  He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't get a grip.  His ARM streeetches, and SNAP!  He falls like a SLINKY, out of control.  Half his body loose, half hard. \nHe drips to the sidewalk, where...Doom steps out.  He catches Reed's face, holds it close. \nDOOM Why the long face? \nDoom whips Reed into the night.  As Doom turns, people cower, horrified by his face.  They clear out, and... \nDoom sees his REFLECTION in a window: scarred skin, metallic veins.  A monster.  Infuriated, he SHATTERS the window with an iron fist, and bounds into the night. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT \nSmoke billows, windows are shattered.  Sue races inside, seeing Doom's devastation.  Silence, deadly silence. Then...she sees a pile of WRECKAGE shift.  BEN crawls out. \nSue shakes her head, sympathetic. \nSUE Ben, you got what we all wanted. You need to stay here.  It's too dangerous. \nShe heads off.  Ben watches her go, helpless. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT \nBen steps back into this ravaged room.  Through the shattered window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away.  A hard beat. \nBEN What...what have I done? \nEXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT \nJohnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and turn, gaining on him, bearing down.  Cars slow, stop.  More people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight. \nINT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nEerily silent.  Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN.  He hears a footstep.  But the room is EMPTY.  No sign of Doom even.  A beat.  He hears a CREAK.  Another CREAK, closer. And... \nA FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT.  It goes taut, clearly being manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND.  Sue APPEARS next to Reed, tube in hand.  She tries to stay calm. \nSUE What has he done to you? \nReed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness. \nDOOM (O.S.) How romantic. \nSUE Victor, please -- \nDOOM It's Doctor Doom to you. \nHe steps closer.  Electrodes course over his metal skin. \nSUE We know the machine works.  It worked on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can turn you back -- \nDOOM Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts? \nShe hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her. \nSUE Victor.  You always thought you were god. \nDoom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast. \nDOOM Sue please, let's not fight. \nSUE No, Victor... Let's. \nShe HURLS a force-field at him.  It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him back a half-step.  But he simply shakes it off, and steps up. Too powerful.  He smiles.  His arms CRACKLE with electricity. \nDOOM Susan...... You're fired. \nBOOM!  He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back. She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING to the floor.  As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her strength to...GO INVISIBLE. \nDOOM (CONT'D) Marco... \nA hanging beat.  We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him. \nDOOM (CONT'D) Polo. \nHe SPINS, GRABS her!  Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to the ground beside Reed.  She lays there, beaten, visible. \nIn the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and out.  Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through the machine).  Reed looks up.  Could it be...? \nEXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT \nJohnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet behind him.  He's running out of options, when he spots: \nA GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.  Thinking fast, Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge. VWOOSH!  The flames ignite and spread quickly. \nHe loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes in on him.  Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit -- \nJOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.  As he tumbles through the air, we CUT BACK TO -- \nINT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nFrom their vantage point, they see the missile explode. Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck. \nReed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN.  It takes every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes a CRACCCKKKKING sound. \nDOOM One more down.  Now it's just the scientist and his specimen. \nSue and Reed lock eyes.  Reed tries to move his mouth.  He has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips and get the words out. \nREED Sue.  The only thing I ever knew without thinking was... (his lips fully freezing) I...love... \nHe starts to say \"you,\" but his lips FREEZE, mid-word.  Sue whispers to him: \nSUE Me too, Reed. \nDoom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow. \nDOOM (quiet, cruel) And so four became none.  It's my time now. \nBOOOOM!  An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM!  SMASH! \nDOOM (CONT'D) Hello Susan. \nShe turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD. Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.  It skids along the street.  Reed helps Ben to his feet. \nDoom turns to these three wounded soldiers. \nDOOM (CONT'D) What is this?  The pitiful three? \nDoom steps toward them, but -- \nVOICE (O.S.) Four. \nWHOOOSH!  Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back. \nJohnny takes his place alongside the others.  The four of them stand as one.  Johnny turns to Thing. \nJOHNNY Had a little relapse, huh? \nThing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) Welcome back. \nThey turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed and melted, making him look all the more menacing. \nDOOM This is going to be fun. \nElectricity starts to course through his body.  He stands at the foot of the crater Ben made.  He THRUSTS down, grabbing a thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street! \nHe SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.  He holds tight, ABSORBING the power.  Lights FLICKER and DIM in buildings around him.  Windows BLOW!  Doom GLOWS, amped up. \nHe LETS GO of the cables!  The two deadly wires SNAKE out of control!  PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.  Reed sees the wires SLASHING through the air.  He makes a move: \nReed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables. \nDoom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.  The electric charges surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but -- \nSue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid- flight.  She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize fighter.  One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field and -- \nSMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!  The pillar starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang! They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!  But -- \nSuddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is holding it up!  He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas holding the world.  People run out, safe. \nON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire. \nREED JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD! \nJohnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the wires back together.  Sparks fly.  The cables start to FUSE. \nDoom keeps FIRING.  Sue struggles with her force-fields.  The impact is too much.  Her nose starts to bleed. \nSUE Can't...hold...on... \nDoom smiles.  Reed sees her.  She is about to drop her hands, vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY! \nHe EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he forms a WALL between Sue and Doom. \nDoom keeps FIRING his bolts.  They SLAM into Reed's body, RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without breaking.  He strains, agonizing. \nREED Johnny.  SUPERNOVA. \nJOHNNY But all these people... \nREED Now. \nJohnny charges toward Doom -- flames on his body starting build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything. Johnny GRABS DOOM. \nTHING (quiet, smiling) Flame on, kid. \nFLASH!  Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT, which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it.  Reed doesn't miss a beat.  He's in total command now. \nREED Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration -- \nSUE (looking at Doom) I'm sure I can come up with something. \nShe concentrates.  She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT. \nSue shuts her eyes.  A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER BODY.  A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.  It SWOOPS past a car, which WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field). \nThing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them. Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.  The light increases, to the point that it's blinding.  People look away. \nFinally, Johnny's supernova fades.  He collapses to the ground, exhausted, smoking.  Sue exhales and falls to her knees.  Her force field fades.  The light flickers out.  As everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.  THUD.  And -- \nDOOM steps through the smoke.  Unharmed.  His metallic body GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.  Sue, Ben, Johnny look devastated.  They can't beat him.  He looks at Reed. \nDOOM Is that the best you can do...?  A little heat...? \nReed stays perfectly calm.  He shakes his head. \nREED Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...? (to Ben) Ben... \nBEN Got it, teach. \nHe KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT.  The water GEYSERS UP!  Ben kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so... \nThe water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom! \n", "test1_input": "FANTASTIC FOUR \nby \nMark Frost and Michael France \nbased on the Marvel comic book by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby \nShooting Script \nFADE IN: \nCLOSE ON A MASSIVE STEEL HEAD \nOur first thought: DR.

His face is chiseled, angular, perfect (too perfect).  Past sparks, we MOVE down to pick up... \nEXT. STREET/VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY \nREED RICHARDS and BEN GRIMM head toward the soaring glass-box atrium of VDI Headquarters.  Designed to inspire awe, it does. \nREED High open space, exposed structural elements.  Obviously aimed at first time visitors to create feelings of... smallness, inadequacy. \nBen glances at Reed, who looks a little nervous. \nBEN Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science -- \nREED This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little... (seeing the statue) Larger than life. \nINT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY \nThey move past the statue, into the sprawling atrium. \nREED He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century. \nBEN You'd never know it. \nHe motions to a high-tech ORB, showing FOOTAGE of VDI's accomplishments: a safe and clean nuclear facility, the first private Space Station. \nAll images have VICTOR front and center, glad-handling George Bush, Tony Blair, shady International Leaders.  The last image is Victor holding the AMERICA'S CUP. \nBEN (CONT'D) Jesus.  That too? \nThey reach three stern RECEPTIONISTS. \nREED Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see -- \nA receptionist cuts him off, handing them each a pass. \nFEMALE RECEPTIONIST Executive elevator, top floor. \nBEN What's the price for a smile round here? \nThey head for the elevator.  Reed carries a small, black box. As they enter the elevator, steel doors shut and we CUT TO -- \nINT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - OFFICE - DAY \nA large, dark office.  Ben in the corner.  He yawns, watches... \nBRIGHT HOLOGRAMS: Stars.  Planets.  They hover in the air, making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space. \nREED (O.S.) My research suggests that exposure to a high-energy cosmic storm born on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life. \nREED stands among the holograms, speaking to a MYSTERIOUS FIGURE in shadow behind a desk.  An ominous, PULSATING RED CLOUD covers the stars.  It washes over a hologram of EARTH. \nREED (CONT'D) In six weeks another cloud with the same elemental profile will pass Earth's orbit.  A study in space could advance our knowledge about the structure of the human genome, and help cure countless diseases, extend human life -- \nThe SHADOW clears his throat.  Reed speeds up, emotional. \nREED (CONT'D) Give kids the chance to be stronger, healthier, less prone to -- \nSHADOWED FIGURE Turn it off.  Please. \nThe figure's DEEP VOICE pierces the darkness. \nREED But I haven't fully explained my -- \nSHADOWED FIGURE Yes you have... Imagination. Creativity.  Passion.  Those were always your trademarks. \nLights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: VICTOR VON DOOM.  35, handsome, commanding.  He looks almost... airbrushed.  He drops a WIRED magazine to the desk.  REED is on the cover over the words: RICHARDS BANKRUPT, GRANT CUTBACKS. \nVICTOR But dreams don't pay the bills, do they? (a condescending smile) Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back. \nREED You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain... \nReed presses the remote.  Another hologram appears: A SHUTTLE slowly approaching AN ORBITING SPACE STATION.  Both bear the VON DOOM INDUSTRIES logo.  Victor smiles, more intrigued. \nVICTOR So it's not my money you want.  It's my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't trust you, why should I? \nVictor is a step ahead.  Reed pauses, thrown for a beat.  Ben wakes up, suspicious.  Victor notices.  He notices everything. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) That's my job.  To stay a step ahead. To know what other men don't. \nBen gets close to Reed, turning toward the door. \nBEN I can't take this. \n", "test1_true": "A beat.  Victor cracks a smile, enjoying the tension.

A little cold: \nSUE (CONT'D) It's just business. \nVICTOR I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm. \nBEN Heya Susie. (under breath, to Reed) One more thing he's got. \nSue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes off of Reed to give Ben a warm hug. \nSUE Ben, it's been too long. \nShe gives Reed a polite handshake.  Victor watches carefully. Reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze.  A little tongue-tied. \nREED You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee-- \nSUE Never better. \nVictor sizes them up.  He puts a hand on Sue's shoulder. \nVICTOR This isn't going to be a problem, is it? \nREED Not at all. \nSUE Ancient history. \nVictor smiles, eyeing Sue. \nVICTOR Good.  Then you're just in time to hear the great Reed Richards ask me for help. (to Reed) You know, you made a lot of folks at MIT feel like a junior high science fair.  So you'll excuse me if I savor the moment. \nBen tightens.  A hard beat.  Reed sucks it up. \nREED You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or -- \nVICTOR The number's seventy-five.  And it's applications and patents. \nBEN What about his first born? \nREED (quiet) Ben, the money's not important.  We could save lives. \nSue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings. \nVICTOR Twenty-five percent of a billion is enough to keep the lights on, isn't it?  Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the Baxter Building. \nThey look at Victor.  How does he know all this...? \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Deal...? \nReed looks at Ben, who shakes his head softly no.  But Reed...drops a nod.  Done.  Victor smiles, offers a handshake. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Well then, to our future.  Together. \nVictor squeezes.  Hard.  His other hand on Sue's shoulder. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Funny how things turn out, isn't it? \nREED Hilarious. \nAs Reed and Sue lock eyes, Ben watches Victor.  Wary. \nINT.

It's the first time she's been nice to him so far.  He smiles, gently, hesitantly, always hesitant with Sue. \nREED Yes.  Yes it is. \nJohnny and Ben exchange a look.

Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly. \nVictor glances at a camera mounted into the console. \nSUE We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here. \nBEN Is it safe? \nREED The shields on the station should protect us. \nBEN Should? \nVICTOR What's wrong, Ben?  Eighty-million dollars worth of equipment not enough for you? \nBen turns to Victor.  A little tension.  Reed cuts it: \nREED Let's start loading those samples. Get your suit ready, Ben. \nVictor keeps his eyes on Ben. \nVICTOR So you still do all the heavy lifting? \nVictor gives a friendly smile, patting Reed. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Maybe you should have stayed back in the lab.

Strictly business. \nJOHNNY Yeah, well, his eyes say different. \nBEN Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either. \nJOHNNY Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up. \nBEN Put your tiny little mind at ease. \nJOHNNY Don't you wander off, boy. \nJohnny steps out of the air-lock and shuts the door.

But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with -- \nSUE Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think... \nVICTOR Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a promotion.  A merger of sorts...

You're just a fad to them. \nHe pulls away from her, taking a step out the door. \nJOHNNY Let's try something new: you live your life.  And I'll live mine. (beat) And just for the record: they LOVE me. \nHe strides into the night, leaving Sue alone.  A dark night. The Fantastic Four is no more.  The family is split apart. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT \nThe transformation chamber is up and running.  Numbers count down.  The storm swirls in the chamber.  Reed now wears the UNIFORM.  He opens the door: \nHE'S GOING TO USE IT ON HIMSELF.  HE IS FINALLY TAKING ACTION. \nINT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nVictor sits enthralled.  He leans forward, breathless. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT \nReed gets closer.  His heart races.  So does Victor's.  A moment of truth for both of them.  REED STEPS INTO THE MACHINE. \nReed looks up at the cosmic storm.  He opens his arms, ready to risk his life.  And...WHHHM!  He JOLTS in JUMP-CUT-MOTION, RECONFIGURING, JERKING out of control, and we CUT TO -- \nVICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nHis screens GO BLACK.  He looks out the window to see...a flash atop the BAXTER BUILDING.  The tip of the Baxter glows. The rest of its lights GO OUT, FLICKERING in a power surge. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT \nLights go haywire.  Sue knows immediately... \nSUE Oh god, Reed. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT \nLights flicker in darkness.  The door rips open.  Sue lunges inside.  She sees through smoke and sparks...REED sways in the chamber.  A beat.  Did it work?  Then... \nReed SLUMPS TO THE GROUND.  His eyes flutter back.  Dead...? His body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard, while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted. \nSUE What did you do, Reed?  What did you do? \nINT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nVictor watches every second on his monitors. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT \nSue struggles to lift Reed -- half of his body is STRETCHED OUT, devoid of any semblance of bone structure.  One side of his face looks like it's MELTING OFF. \nREED I can...make it work. \nSUE Reed, stop, you need to rest your -- \nREED The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm -- \nSUE You need a doctor. \nReed loses consciousness.  Sue carries him out. \nINT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nVictor watches, his eyes narrow, looking at his hands. \nVICTOR More power...? \nHe reaches out for his phone, and...his SPEAKERPHONE AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON.  His powers growing. \nVICTOR (TO PHONE) (CONT'D) Leonard.  Bring me our lab rat. \nEXT. UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT \nBen sits alone, looking at city lights.  A man without a home.  Without a family.  A hard beat.  HEADLIGHTS slash across Ben.  He slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a LIMO. \nLEONARD Ben!  They need you back at the Baxter building.  It's...Reed. \nBen considers.  Despite it all, he's a good friend.  And a good man.  As he gets into the car, we hear THROBBING MUSIC IN -- \nINT. MANHATTAN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT \nLOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS.  A young crowd dances and grinds to the beat.  Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF FLAME swirl around the ceiling.  We follow them to: \nA BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section. He's surrounded by \"groupies\" climbing over each other to get a look at his various parlour tricks. \nHe leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN.  Closer.  Candles around them start to melt.  Beads of sweat drip down her face. \nJOHNNY What do you say we get out of here? \nShe pauses.  And...a very LARGE MAN steps up. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) This your boyfriend? \n", "test3_true": "BOYFRIEND Is that all you do?  Bar tricks and stealing chicks... \nJohnny does one more trick...taps the guy's drink...igniting it into a burst of flame.  The Boyfriend drops the glass, which SMASHES on the ground...catches the floor on fire. \nThe boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out. \nGIRLFRIEND What are you doing?!  You could have burned somebody! \nThe boyfriend takes his girlfriend's hand, they start to walk off.  She turns back for one last comment... \nGIRLFRIEND (CONT'D) You know, if I had your power I'd be doing something with it, not wasting my time doing cheap bar tricks, hitting on some other guy's girl. \nJohnny looks a little embarrassed.  The couple leaves. Johnny glances around.  His FANS look down, away.  He sees how quickly they can turn.  The crowd parts slightly.  He looks very alone. \nINT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT \nLeonard leads The Thing inside.  The ominous chamber sits with its door open.  Victor enters from the control station. \nVICTOR Ben, come in. \nBEN What is this?  Where's Reed? \nVICTOR Where do you think?  With Sue. \nBen looks at the flickering lights.  Suspicious.  Victor turns to Leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark room. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) (quiet) I'll take it from here, Leonard. \nLeonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here. \nLEONARD Yes sir. \nLeonard disappears fast, as Victor turns back to Ben. \nBEN What do you want, Vic? \nVICTOR To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready. \nBen shakes his head, wanting to believe, but... \nBEN Reed said it'd be weeks till -- \nVICTOR He also said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out. \nBen nods.  Reed was wrong before.  Ben gets closer to the machine, drawn to it.  He wants to believe, so badly. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for \"Mr. Fantastic.\" \nBEN And you can?  Power it up? \nVictor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little SPARK around him.  The lights...?  Or his skin...? \nVICTOR Yes.  I've found a new energy source. \nHe keeps his arm behind his back -- his fingertips course with ELECTRICITY.  It starts to build, sparking up his arm. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Tell me...do you want to be Ben Grimm again? \nBen keeps his eyes on the machine.  His dream is alive. \nBEN Let's do it. \nINT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT \nThe chamber doors open.  Thing enters.  He looks around this sterile box.  An animal in a cage.  Victor pushes a control; the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal.  Thing shuts his eyes.  He just wants to be Ben again. \nFROM THE CONTROLS: Victor initiates the transformation sequence.  As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in the lab.  Energy pumps into the chamber.  The storm swirls faster.  Lights flicker...there's not enough power, until -- \n-- Victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both hands...and WHHHM!  A countdown begins in the control panels. \nSLOW MOVE IN on the chamber, The Thing's face in the window. The chamber activates.  The storm strikes hard. \nThe Thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony. Struggling violently inside.  To escape?  Extend the moment: Condensation obscures the chamber window: The Thing vanishes. \nEXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT \nThe city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie glow.  Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of the Baxter Building.  The rest of the city lights dim slightly. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT \nReed lies in bed, weak, recuperating.  When the power surges, we MOVE in on him: he looks up in alarm, knowing that someone's using the chamber.  He starts to get out of bed, straining to stand with every muscle left in his body. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM - SAME TIME \nSue sifts through a cabinet full of medications.  The lights dim.  Power failure.  She looks up... \nEXT. CLUB - NIGHT \nJohnny walks alone.  A WAVE OF LIGHT spreads through the sky. He looks up.  His eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes where it's coming from.  He starts RUNNING toward the Baxter. \nINT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT \nINSIDE THE MACHINE, the RED CLOUD swirls with debris, crackling with light.  The chamber rattles dangerously, as the power seems to SHAKE the very foundation of the building. \n", "test3_id": 773}

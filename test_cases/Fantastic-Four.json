The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best -- \nBEN (O.S.)

Give me the god damn mirror! \nBen grabs it from him.  Then slowly raises it to look and see that...except for some serious stubble, Ben's totally normal. \nJOHNNY Unfortunately, the doctors just couldn't do anything to fix your face! \nHe cackles as he heads for the door.

Johnny slows, looking at Reed's hair. \nJOHNNY Nice 'do.  Going for the \"grandpa\" look? \nReed passes a mirror, slowing, seeing his gray hairs.  He keeps going.  He passes a partially open door.  He stops when he catches a glimpse of Sue asleep in bed.  He sees a vase of flowers.  He grabs a couple lilies, and enters. \nBut Reed sees...the room is already FILLED with expensive flowers.  All from VICTOR.  Reed is trumped once again. \nA DOCTOR writes on Sue's chart.  A wall TV plays a press conference with Victor, outside the FACILITY.  He looks worse for wear.  A few hairs out of place, and a small BANDAGE on his face.  We PUSH INTO the press conference -- \nREPORTER #1 You've been accused in the past of moving science a little too fast -- \nVICTOR Accused by who?  My competitors? \nREPORTER #2 But surely this accident gives you pause -- \nVICTOR Danger is always part of discovery. What would have happened if Ben Franklin never went out in a storm? Without risk, there's no reward. \nREPORTER #3 So where's the reward?  You promised a cure-all. \nVictor pauses.  For the first time.  Just a flicker. \nVICTOR And you'll have it.  I've never come up short.  And I'm not going to start now. \nREPORTER #2 So you're still taking VDI public -- \nVICTOR Yes, of course.

We know what we're doing... One more day of observation, then you're all cleared. \nThe Doctor takes his clipboard, and walks out.  Reed steps to Sue, with the drooping flowers in his hand.  Quiet: \nREED Sue...I want to tell you...I'm... \nWHOOSH.  A NURSE rolls in with a tray bearing ten more extravagant bouquets.  Reed looks resigned.  He walks out. \nREED (CONT'D) She's allergic to orchids.  Put that Amaryllis Apapathos by her bed.  The African lilies?

You surprised? \nNow we PULL BACK to reveal DEBBIE and BEN on a SCREEN.  The Thing watches the old videotape.  He smiles sadly at his old life.  He mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart. \nBEN (ON SCREEN) Yeah I'm surprised.  Surprised the fire department didn't shut this down. \nON SCREEN: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a SURPRISE PARTY.  Full of people.  Ben Grimm is a popular guy. On screen: Reed hugs Ben.  They pose for pictures together. \nTHE THING God.  I was good looking. \nWe hear the party sing \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY.\"  Debbie kisses Ben. Thing's eyes start to mist.  On screen: Ben blows out candles. \nDEBBIE (ON SCREEN) What did you wish for, honey? \nBEN (ON SCREEN) I already got it.  Everything I want. \nAs they kiss, a tear runs down Thing's cheek.

As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight: \nREED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall.  His ARM is STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner.  Ben just shakes his head, keeps moving.  And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM... \nUP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL.  The muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut.  Finally, we reach... \nREED.  He steps slowly.  He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in his other hand, measuring distance.  His skin STREEETCHES. His face tightens, pained.  We hear the faint SQUEAK of his skin. \nVOICE (O.S.) Damn, Stretch! \nReed turns his head around, seeing JOHNNY come down the hall. \nJOHNNY How far's that rubber bend? \nReed keeps moving, slowly.  His muscles and tendons laboring. \nREED That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.

Johnny's brow furrows, a thought forming, a mischievous smile on his lips. \nEXT. BAXTER BUILDING - SIDE EXIT - NIGHT \nA FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora. Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO -- \nEXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT \nDark.  Lights flicker.  Steam rises through the grates.  A shadow emerges.  Ben.

O'DONNEL'S PUB - NIGHT \nA big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a place over the bar.  Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT.  He moves through the crowd.  People clear out of the way. \nBen reaches the bar.  He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH!  SMASH! The stool SNAPS like a toothpick.  He hits the ground hard. Glasses shake.  A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly. \nBEN That's not funny! \nThey go silent.  They drop bills onto tables, filing out, scared of this monster.  ERNIE works the bar. \nERNIE Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first mook from Brooklyn to go to outer space, so pay him some respect! \nBut the patrons keep filing out.  Ben looks down, weary. \nBEN Ernie.  Sorry for killing your business.  I'll take the usual, then I'm out... Better make it a double. \nErnie heads for the booze.  Ben gives a sad shake of his head.  Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the bar.  A beautiful young woman nursing a drink.  Meet ALICIA MASTERS. \nALICIA Who killed the party? \nShe turns to him, unafraid.  He notices her blank stare, lack of focus, and white cane.  Alicia is blind. \nERNIE (O.S.) Make it a triple.  On the house, Benny. \nBen takes his drink, but SMASH!

(feeling his arm) ...not that I could. \nShe puts a hand on his face -- something in her tone and gentle touch allows Ben to let her.  She smiles softly. \nALICIA (CONT'D) Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing. \nBEN Trust me, this ain't one of those times. \nShe smiles softly, takes her cane, and starts to head out. \nALICIA See you round, Benny... \nRight as she hits the door, over her shoulder -- \nALICIA (CONT'D) I'm Alicia, by the way. \nBen watches her disappear.

There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you... \nSue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short. \nSUE (slow, careful) Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't -- \nVICTOR Susan.  What are you doing? \nHe is cold as ice.  If he's hurt, he'll never show it. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) You think I brought you here to talk about us?  Please.  This is business. (leaning forward, intense) I need to know: how close is Reed to finding to a cure? \nShe pauses.  Then: \nSUE He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before -- \nVICTOR Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two? \nShe holds tight, keeping cool. \nSUE If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us. \nVICTOR Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass... (closer, cruel) It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his science project. \nThe words sting.  She can't help but hear some truth in them. \nSUE Please don't make this personal -- \nVICTOR Oh, I think you already have. \nSUE Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready. \nVictor's fist CLENCHES -- metal SFX. \nVICTOR \"We,\" huh? \nVictor SCREECHES his chair back, PUSHING the table so hard that he SPILLS water.  Heads turn, all eyes on Sue.  Victor gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder. \nVICTOR (CONT'D) Don't forget who you work for, Susan. So get to work.  And do your job. \nHe walks out.  As he goes, he slips the engagement ring out of his pocket.  He crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night. \nSue sits embarrassed.  She slowly...disappears.  People gasp. She walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which DRIFT through the air.  At a TABLE FULL OF BUSINESSMEN -- \nBUSINESSMAN I wish my wife would disappear. \nThe other men laugh, but WHHM!  The man's wine SPILLS into his LAP!  Sue walks out.  The restaurant is left buzzing.

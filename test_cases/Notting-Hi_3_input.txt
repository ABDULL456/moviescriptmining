Mix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide open -- thinking. 
INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Morning.  Max, all in his suit for the city... Bella kisses him goodbye.  William sees this from the kitchen.  She is also dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her briefcase with law books from the kitchen table. 
EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY 
William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night away from home, a heads off. 
EXT. NEWSAGENT - DAY 
William walks past the newsagent, heading for home.  We see, though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front page.  Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!' and 'Scott of Pantartica.' 
INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY 
William is shaving.  The bell goes.  He heads out to answer it. 
EXT./INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -DAY 
William arrives at the door and opens it.  There stands a dark- glassed Anna. 
ANNA Hi.  Can I come in? 
WILLIAM Come in. 
She moves inside.  Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired. Nothing idealized. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The two of them. 
ANNA They were taken years ago -- I know it was... well, I was poor and it happens a lot -- that's not an excuse -- but to make things worse, it now appears someone was filming me as well.  So what was a stupid photo- shoot now looks like a porno film. And well... the pictures have been solid and they're everywhere. 
William shakes his head. 
ANNA I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded. 
WILLIAM This is the place. 
ANNA Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be. 
She's very shaken. 
ANNA These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like... 
WILLIAM Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...? 
ANNA A bath would be great. 
INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY 
Spike enters through the front door.  William doesn't hear him. Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it. 
SPIKE Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic .... magnificent... 
He heads up the stairs.  Opens the bathroom door, walks in. 
INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Spike heads for the toilet -- undoes his zip... 
ANNA You must be Spike. 
She's in the bath.  Spike turns in shock -- and sidles out of the bathroom. 
INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY 
Spike calms himself down.  He then opens the bathroom door again -- and looks in.

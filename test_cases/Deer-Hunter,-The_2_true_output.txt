JOHN Fucking women, man... 
ALBERT (shakes his head) I know... 
INT. CADILLAC NIGHT 
NICK'S head is sunk below the upper rim of the steering wheel. One eye is entirely shut and the open one seems close to death. Suddenly his head snaps up. He slams his foot down on the brake and the Cadillac fishtails, rubber screaming, to a jolting stop. 
EVERYONE in the car comes awake ten bleary eyes staring out through the windshield. 
There are deer in the road, fifteen or twenty of them standing in the headlights. 
EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
VINCE, ALBERT, NICK and JOHN pile out with their rifles. VINCE immediately slips and falls down. 
VINCE Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em! 
JOHN Who's got the ammo? 
ALBERT Ammo! Get the ammo! 
VINCE I'll get it! Where is it? 
JOHN It's in the trunk!... It's in the trunk! I'm telling you, it's in the trunk! 
VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush around to the trunk. ALBERT begins pounding on it. 
VINCE There, Albert! Hit it there! 
Pushing and shoving each other, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush around to the side of the car. As they pass along the embankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound, like a sigh, and all three of them simultaneously vanish. 
NICK, who has been watching, stares at the place where his three friends disappeared. He takes a few steps forward, realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle of the road, helpless with laughter. 
VINCE (CONT'D) (getting out of the car) Man, let's go hunting!... Where are they? 
NICK makes a gesture, a downward pointing of his finger. VINCE crosses to the side of the road. 
EXT. RAVINE - NIGHT 
The slope is a good 45 plus. At the bottom, barely visible, three tiny figures flop in the snow. 
EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
VINCE looks down at the three hunters with an expression of absolute disgust. He looks at NICK -- flat on his back, pounding his feet, howling -- and then he looks at the deer. The deer are still watching. If anything they have edged closer and their massed expression of polite curiosity throws VINCE into a blind rage. 
VINCE Get out of here, damn you! Go home!... Scat!... Shoo! 
VINCE, whose rifle is fully loaded, slams a shell into the chamber and lets off a barrage of shots above the deer. 
VINCE (CONT'D) Bastards! Assholes! Get lost! 
EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAWN 
The sky is cold -- first light -- with low, wind-driven clouds. CAMERA TILTS DOWN and we see NICK's Cadillac coming up a narrow road flanked by precipitous, heavily forested ridges on both sides. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN 
The Cadillac seems minuscule, overwhelmed by the massive, black slopes looming up from the road. 
INT. CADILLAC - DAWN 
Everyone is eating cold hot dogs, ripping them out of a half dozen plastic packages, dipping them in a jar of mustard and stuffing them down. Hot dog juice has dripped over everything, potato chips are littered everywhere and both beer and milk are being passed around. 
ALBERT Fuel up. Need fuel. 
JOHN Those are mine! 
ALBERT You want 'em? 
JOHN Damn right! 
ALBERT Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle. 
MERLE Here's a Hershey. 
ALBERT tears off the wrapper, dips it in the mustard and glomps it down. 
JOHN That's mustard! 
ALBERT (mouth jammed full) What?

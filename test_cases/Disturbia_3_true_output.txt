Ashley and Kale glance around for weapons. Ashley pockets the scissors, grabs a letter opener off dad's desk. Kale finds his racketball racket and the ball. Pockets the ball, slips the racket in the back of his shorts, then grabs the baseball bat as he heads for the bookshelves near the door that leads to the outside porch. He reaches up, runs his fingers to the third book on the middle shelf, pulls it out, flips it open to reveal a KEY that drops in his hand. 
KALE (CONT'D) Once I have his attention, you go get her. 
Ashley nods. Kale takes the key, heads to the porch door, unlocks it with a quiet CLICK. He swings the door open, steps out onto... 
106   EXT. 2ND FL PORCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                             106 
Kale raises the bat, swings it at the 2nd floor hallway window that separates the interior of the house from the porch. The window SHATTERS. Kale tosses the bat back to Ashley. 
KALE (to Giles O.S.) We're out here, asshole! 
There's a lull in the thunder. All becomes eerily quiet for a beat as Kale waits for Giles to appear at the window. He glances back at Ashley who ducks behind the wall inside dad's office -- she glances to the office door. No more BANGING. She shrugs to Kale: "where is he?" 
Another beat, then suddenly -- a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals 
GILES 
Standing in the other porch doorway BEHIND KALE! 
ASHLEY Kale! 
Kale whirls around just as Giles reaches out, grabs him by the throat, pulls him off his feet and HURLS KALE through the shattered window into the hallway! 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) NO!   You son of a -- 
Ashley charges out onto the porch with the bat. Swings it at Giles who promptly RIPS it from her hand and hurls it off the porch. Ashley whips out the letter opener, spins around, about to stab Giles, but he backhands her. Ashley falls, SMACKS her head on the porch railing.

She drops to the floor, half conscious as Giles picks up the letter opener, turns his attention back to the 2nd floor hallway window -- 
HIS POV - THE HALLWAY - KALE'S GONE. 
WHIP PAN to behind Giles -- REVEAL KALE - CHARGING OUT the same porch door Giles just came out! Kale uses his FULL BODY WEIGHT to SHOVE Giles back through the SAME BROKEN WINDOW and into the hallway! 
KALE Ashley!   Are you okay? 
ASHLEY I wanna kill him -- 
KALE Stick to the plan -- 
Over this, Kale pulls Ashley to her feet. They share a smile as Ashley ducks into the porch door leading to Kale's room. Kale turns back -- 
KALE'S POV - A BLOODY GILES 
Gets to his feet and heads toward the window.   Kale turns for the ladder, starts climbing up. 
Giles pursues, steps out the window as we see Ashley, in the b.g., appear from Kale's bedroom and race for the stairs! 
107   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                      107 
Kale reaches the top of the ladder, steps onto the roof, but Giles, from below, HEAVES THE LADDER UPWARD, tripping Kale. Kale SLAMS down on the roof, smacks the back of his head. 
KALE'S BLURRY POV - against a fury of lightning flashes, Giles races up the ladder and steps onto the roof. Stalks toward Kale. 
Kale gets to his feet, draws the racketball racket from his shorts, takes out the ball, assumes a professional looking serving position and WHAM! Kale beams the ball at Giles -- and misses completely. 
KALE That was a warning! 
Giles rushes Kale who wails on him with the racket. Giles ducks, spins around, brings his fist up and punches Kale in the chest.

Kale drops the racket. It slides away down the roof as Kale doubles over. But Giles grabs Kale before he can fall. He pulls Kale up off his feet, pulls him closer, gets in his face. Kale summons some strength, tilts his head up and HEADBUTTS GILES. 
Giles stumbles back, pulling Kale with him. Giles SLAMS down on the roof. He and Kale roll down the incline and stop just short of the edge -- 
Kale looks over, spots his STEREO SPEAKER a few feet away. 
108   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                 108 
Ashley rounds the corner, heads to Julie. 
ASHLEY Hi, Mrs. Brecht, I'm Ashley -- (re: duct tape) It's gonna hurt. 
Julie nods as Ashley RIPS the tape off Julie's mouth. 
JULIE (not flinching) Where's Kale? 
109   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                        109 
Kale HURLS the speaker at Giles', SMACKING him hard.        Giles shakes it off, grabs the speaker wire -- 
WITH KALE - he gets to his feet, heads back up the roof as Giles suddenly whips out the letter opener and hurls it like a THROWING KNIFE at Kale. 
The letter opener embeds itself in the back of Kale's thigh. Kale screams, falls to his knees.

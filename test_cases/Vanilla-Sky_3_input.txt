DAVID I'm sorry to do this early. I gotta be done by 10. Car phone rings. David checks Caller ID - it's his office. He clicks on. 
ASSISTANT VOICE   (RACHEL) You're not going to make the 8:45, are you? 
DAVID How did you find me? 
RACHEL'S VOICE David Aames, you have to check the colors of the letters for the new issue of Rise. 
DAVID What are the colors? 
RACHEL'S VOICE Yellow-and-red... or the traditional white. 
DAVID Let, me think about it. 
RACHEL'S VOICE David, please. Don't be late for the ten o'clock with the board. 
DAVID Okay, but. don't tell anybody where I am I don't care if God calls. I'm very busy. 
BRIAN Can't you just get rid of that board? 
DAVID The Seven Dwarves? No. 
BRIAN Those people drive you nuts. 
DAVID And that was the desire of my father, who hired them. 
BRIAN (suspicious pause) You fucked Julie Gianni again, didn't you? David takes off driving. 
INT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY - DRIVING 
BRIAN I know someone was there when I called. You had that tone. (imitates nasal phone voice) Oh, no man, I've got a cold. I'm hanging in tonight. 
DAVID (shaky defense) I had a cold. I was alone. 
BRIAN Fine. You can do whatever you want with your life - 
DAVID Thanks. 
BRIAN -- but one day you'll know what love truly is. It's the sour and the sweet. And I know sour which allows me to appreciate the sweet. 
DAVID Julie Gi.anni is a friend. Sometimes we sleep together. Brian howls in pain, like a hurt dog. 
DAVID What -- 
BRIAN My dream girl... Julie Gianni... is your... fuck buddy. Brian emits another pained howl. David reaches over to change the music. 
DAVID What do you want to listen to? 
BRIAN Slow down, man. 
DAVID What have we got here - Barcelona, Looper... Radiohead? Brian freezes at what he sees. 
BRIAN Look out! Look out! David turns and sees he's hurtling into the back of a car stopped just in front of him. Clenching he hits the brakes, narrowly avoiding a high-speech collision. And then... to his right... another car comes hurtling toward him... and stops within an inch of deadly impact.           There is an awful moment, as the second car blares on the horn. Traffic continues, but the lingering feeling of dread and confusion is still in the air. 
BRIAN Fuck! 
DAVID (annoyed) We almost died. 
BRIAN I know. My own death was right there in front of me, and you know what happened? Your life flashed before my eyes.

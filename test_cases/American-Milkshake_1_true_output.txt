JOLIE Are you sure you wanna do that? We're in the middle of C hall. 
HAROON I told you. I don't give a fuck. 
JOLIE Really? On Mr. Applebaum's door? Yall have been warring. He's gonna know it was you. 
HAROON So what? 
Haroon pulls out a spray-paint can and writes the words 'Thugg Life' over Mr. Applebaum's classroom door and wall. 
JOLIE (SOFT) Jesus Christ, man. (MORE) 
JOLIE (CONT'D) You just sprayed painted `thugg life' on Mr. Applebaum's door. 
HAROON I know. Duh. 
They admire the work for a moment. Then run for cover. 
They burst through an exit and out into the blinding light. 
EXT. SCHOOL ZONE 
Haroon and Jolie run into the teachers' parking lot ducking between cars as they catch their breath. 
JOLIE You could get suspended for that. 
HAROON Who cares? What does school even matter? 
JOLIE What's gotten into you? 
HAROON I don't know. (BEAT) Maybe my parents are getting divorced and you don't even know about it. 
JOLIE Are you serious? 
Haroon draws the spray can like he's about to go to work on the cars, but Jolie fights him for it. 
HAROON Gimmie my spray-paint! Owww. Fuck you. 
JOLIE It's for your own good. This car belongs to Principal Ganus. 
They stair each other down. 
HAROON I swear, of all the things you have to worry about. 
JOLIE What's that supposed to mean. 
HAROON Come on dude. 
JOLIE Come on what? 
HAROON Are you numb? The whole school knows Christine is pregnant with your baby. 
JOLIE Dude. It's not like that. She's gonna get an abortion. She comes from a wealthy family. 
HAROON So what if she does. Doesn't it mean anything to you? 
JOLIE I don't know. I don't know what it means. It just happened. 
Jolie ponders the situation. Haroon shakes his head. 
Jolie pulls out a magic marker and begins to write on the car. 
HAROON Magic marker? That is so lame. Don't get me started. 
Haroon pops the top of his spray can and begins to shake it. 
INT. JOLIE'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
Lit by a TV, the room could be it's own apartment. 
Wendel sleeps with a Super Nintendo controllers in his laps, on a futon. Arius, Codroy and a few kids from the team are asleep all around the room. 
JOLIE (V.O.) Once everyone heard that I got Christine pregnant, it was like I was the coolest kid in school. (MORE) 
JOLIE (CONT'D) All the kids from the team wanted to hang at my place while my parents were gone. And even some cheerleaders came too. 
Christine and Jolie make-out, lying on the floor/power pad.

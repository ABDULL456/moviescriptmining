Hawk scopes out the cafeteria to make sure the coast is clear. 
HAWK Ok, dudes, follow my lead. 
LEX Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school? 
TRIP About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway. 
LEX Hello summer detention. 
HAWK As I was saying, follow my lead. And maintain. Elvis just showed up. 
Hawk points across the cafeteria and sure enough Elvis has just entered. Luckily, he hasn't noticed the boys yet. 
Elvis swaggers to a table of CHEERLEADERS, puts his leg on a chair and starts a one-sided conversation with them. They promptly push their trays away, having lost their appetites. 
Meanwhile, back at the condiment tray, Hawk and Trip each grab a big handful of ketchup packets and head to a table. Lex reluctantly follows suit grabbing a big handful of ketchup packets too. All three of them put their trays down and sit. 
HAWK (eyeing Elvis) Five second rule, boys. See you on the other side. 
Hawk approaches the exit door, glances either way, then leaves. 
Trip and Lex look at their watches for five seconds. Then Trip heads for the exit door also. 
Lex still stares at his watch. After five, he looks at Elvis, who stops talking to the cheerleaders. As if possessing some sixth sense, Elvis turns quickly and looks STRAIGHT INTO CAMERA. 
ELVIS'S POV -- He spots the swinging exit door and an empty table with three full lunch trays sitting on it. 
ELVIS Excuse me, ladies. 
Relieved he's gone, the cheerleaders start eating again. 
Elvis moves through the cafeteria in SLOW MOTION toward the exit door. The hunter in action. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Elvis pushes through the door and into a hall, dead-eye stare focused up ahead where the hallway turns sharply. He catches a glimpse of Lex. Smiling like the devil, Elvis bolts. 
INT. OTHER HALLWAY - DAY 
Lex catches up with Hawk and Trip just as Elvis swings around the corner and marauds after them CACKLING maniacally. A mad chase ensues. Down hallways. Around corners. Upstairs. Down ramps. 
Hawk, Trip, and Lex scramble as fast as they can to escape the clutches of their sideburn-clad nemesis. 
As the boys pass a classroom, a NERD comes out pushing a projector on an AV cart. Thinking fast, Hawk grabs it out of the nerd's hands and pushes it down the hall at Elvis. 
NERD Hey, I'm responsible for that! 
CRASH! Elvis bashes face-first into the rolling cart. He and the projector go tumbling. Not wasting a second, Elvis is back on his feet and after them again. The nerd grabs his hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector. 
AROUND A CORNER 
Elvis SKIDS around the corner and trips on a fire hose stretched across the floor from its glass box to a water fountain pipe. He slides on his belly along the polished floor unable to stop. 
INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY 
Old MISS HIBBS is lecturing on MOBY DICK. The kids are dozing. 
MISS HIBBS Then a cry from the crow's nest... "Thar she blows!" 
Suddenly, a screaming Elvis slides into the open door on his stomach and bowls Miss Hibbs over like a Brunswick. He clamors to his feet and shoots out the room leaving everyone stunned. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Pausing at the corner, Elvis takes a breath and leaps around it. He smiles at what he sees. 
Up ahead, Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand on a 3-stair stoop, desperately pulling at a locked door. Elvis smiles. They GULP. 
ELVIS KISS concert? Kiss my ass morelike. A nice, fat detention oughta put a crimp in this evening's plans. 
Elvis takes his key ring off his belt and begins twirling it. The boys turn and face him. He savors the moment. 
ELVIS Looking for something, rodents? 
HAWK Yeah, Elvis... 
Hawk's brow furrows as he pulls about fifty ketchup packets out of his pocket. Trip and Lex do the same. 
HAWK ..Your ass on a lunch tray.

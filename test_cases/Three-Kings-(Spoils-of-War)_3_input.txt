Jaeger and Wes watch as, shielded by their bodies, Epps palms a grenade from his belt.  Wes and Jaeger don't quite smile, but they know now they at least have a chance.  As Epps stands the other two turn to face the Iraqis.  They all fold their hands behind their necks which, for Epps, hides the grenade from view.  Slowly they walk towards the gunship. One of the Iraqis starts to yell something.  He lifts his weapon and aims it at our boys.  With his thumb Epps yanks the pin from the grenade and lets fly.  It's a perfect toss, landing in the chopter's bay.  The Iraqis see the grenade land, they scramble for it.  One of them grabs it up and is about to throw it back out of the gunship. 
Too late. 
The grenade explodes in the Iraqi's hand killing him instantly.  It also touches off a fire ball that severely damages the gunship.  It rocks, lists, spins wildly out of control. 
EPPS(CONT) Get down! 
Our three hug the ground as the chopter's rotors go whipping through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among them.  Worse still the gunship, now a lame bird, drops from the sky towards Epps, Jaeger and Wes.  All they can do is cover their heads, as if that would do any good against two tons of crashing steel.  The chopter rushes down...down, but it just misses them.  It slams into the ground skipping over the edge of the plateau, to the rocks below. 
Our three pick themselves up.  They walk to the edge of the plateau and look down on the crash. 
Jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees and looks as if he's about to go into shock. 
JAEGER Oh, God... 
Wes looks down at Jaeger with a bit of a disdainful sneer. 
WES Yeah.  Just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it? 
They stare for awhile, then one by one move off.  Us?  We: 
FADE TO: 
BLACK 
FADE TO: 
EXT. DESERT/MESA - LATER 
Epps, Wes and Jaeger trek to a large crevice that runs straight down into the ground.  Jaeger takes out his maps and photos.  Epps consults the navicom. 
WES What do you think? 
JAEGER Lines up with the map and the photos. 
EPPS We're right where we should be. 
Epps tucks the navicom away on his belt and takes a look around.  Not much to see. 
EPPS(CONT) I sure don't see much place else around here to hide anything. 
Wes pulls a lantern/flashlight from his pack.  Going to his belly he shines it down into the crevice. 
WES Can't see anything. 
He tosses a rock into it.  We can hear it hit the ground below. 
WES(CONT) It's got a bottom. 
JAEGER Guess we know what the next stop is. 
EPPS All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see. 
WES What am I supposed to do? 
EPPS Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either. 
JAEGER Think there might be more Iraqis? 
EPPS Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns. 
CUT TO: 
WE SEE A FEW QUICK SHOTS of Wes securing a line down into the crevice, Epps and Jaeger clipping on rapeling harnesses, the two men lowering themselves down into the great unknown. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CREVICES - CONTINUOUS 
The lantern punches a hole through the darkness as Epps uses it like a machete to blaze a trial.  He sinks down...down until finally they touch bottom.  He unclips himself from the rope and Jaeger starts down. 
The space isn't that big, like a small cave really.  It's tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole of it.  But it's big enough that one wouldn't have any idea where to start digging. 
Jaeger makes it to the bottom.  Wes yells down. 
WES You down? 
JAEGER Yeah, we're down. 
WES What do you see? 
EPPS Nothing.

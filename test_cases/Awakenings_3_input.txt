REV. 10/13/89   p. 17 He glances around. Sees an orderly reading a newspaper. (P\   Borrows a section, returns with it, slides it under the pen and waits. The man doesn't write. Doesn't move. Sayer takes the pen back, returns it to his coat pocket, hesitates, pulls it out again, holds it out . . . and lets it go. The man, lightning quick, catches it.

Another man rigid as stone (FRANK). This one peering up at a television set with a horizontal hold problem. Sayer drags a chair over, stands       on it, adjusts the set, corrects it, gets a picture . . .      but the man's "attention" slowly drifts away. Sayer "read       justs" it, gets the jumping horizontal lines again, and the       man's vacant eyes return. 
26.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY                                . 26. Another dayroom crowded with patients, one of which stands before a table, absolutely motionless, on thin bird-like legs. It is Lucy, the one who caught/the tennis ball. The movement of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness. Sayer considers her from all      angles as    one considers an abstract art piece that baff     les but in   trigues. Unlike the others, she's on her feet. A      nd unlike    the others, she seems, to Sayer, to have been headed      somewhere    before turning to stone again. He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain across the room. And that it's the table, like a barrier, that has arrested her progress. He moves the table. In what appears to be slow motion, she takes a tiny step. And another. And another before encountering and being "blocked" by an empty wheelchair. She stops. Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her path. She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the fountain before mysteriously stopping again. Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers in her way, but she's not moving. Defeated, he goes to the fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her. Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another "ghost" (LEONARD), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive. "At" Sayer.

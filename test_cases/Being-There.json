{"train": "Being There - December 16, 1978 Draft \nFADE IN: \nEXT. TOWNHOUSE GARDEN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON \nAn afternoon in late November, the leaves have left the trees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches. The garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a high brick wall. At one end stands the rear of a three-story brick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building. CLASSICAL MUSIC is heard in the distance. A MAN, handsomely dressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the garden. A gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth as he turns the loam along one of the walkways. He works slowly,-precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings. This man is called CHANCE. \nChance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from inside his coat, checks the time. He looks to the darkening skies, returns the watch to his pocket. As Chance starts toward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of his pitchfork. \nINT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON \nThe sound of the music increases as Chance enters the garage from the garden. A gleaming 1921 TOURING CAR is revealed as he walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a wall. Chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf, carefully puts it over the car. When he finishes covering the car for the night, Chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the garage through a side entry. \nINT. POTTING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nThe Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener, everything arranged in an orderly fashion. Rows of small pots are on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. A small, 1940's table model black-and-white TV rests on a shelf. It is playing, tuned to the BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA. Attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing colored gels. The wheels spins, creates an early form of color TV. As Chance enters, his attention is on the television set. He watches it as he oils the tines of the pitchfork and puts it away. Chance turns off the TV and leaves the room, but the sound of the Boston Pops continues. \nINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON \nA room adjacent to the Potting Room. A large screen remote control color television set dominates the room. It is on, tuned to the Boston Pops. In contrast to the new TV, the rest of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with expensive furniture of the twenties. There are no books, magazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be seen. Chance comes in, watches the TV with a detached gaze as he removes his apron. He changes the channel with the remote control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a laundry bag. He takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the closet where it is accompanied by several others, all of like quality. Chance changes the channel once again. \nEXT. GARDEN - NIGHT \nChance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry bag, crosses from the rear building to the main house. \nINT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the warmth of oak. White dropcloths and sheets cover all of the furniture. Chance enters, walks through the hallway. \nINT. MAIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs. It is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and place setting uncovered. A small portable color TV is next to the place setting. \nChance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near the doorway. He sits at the dining room table, turns on the TV, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as he watches the screen. LOUISE, an elderly black maid, enters with a tray of food and Chance's clean laundry. \nLOUISE (sets dinner before Chance) ... Evening, Chance. \nCHANCE (slowly, perfect diction, no accent of any kind) ... Good evening, Louise. \nLouise sets Chance's clean clothes on the small table, picks up his laundry bag. \nLOUISE ... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance. \nCHANCE (begins to eat) I see. \nLOUISE I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by... \nChance, his manners impeccable, concentrates on the TV as he eats. A buzzer SOUNDS, Louise looks upstairs. \nLOUISE (CONT'D) ... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again... \nCHANCE (still watches TV) Is his back feeling better? \nLouise gives Chance a look. \nLOUISE ... Gobbledegook... You and your gobbledegook. You're gonna be the death of me yet, Chance... (she turns to leave) ... Unless those stairs are... The Good Lord's liable to snatch up two unwillin' souls at the same time if I keep on trampin' up those stairs... I don't want none of that... \nLouise disappears through the doorway. Chance continues to eat and watch TV. \nINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN \nChance is asleep, lying on his back. His eyes slowly open, and, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on the TV with the remote control. Chance gets out of bed, goes to the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer, checks the time. He crosses to the closet, his eyes never straying from an early morning show on television. He puts on a bathrobe and leaves the room. \nINT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN \nChance enters, turns on the TV with the spinning color wheel, then waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can. He turns off the TV and exits. \nINT. GARAGE - DAWN \nChance comes into the garage, takes the cover off of the touring car, folds it and puts it on a shelf. He leaves the garage. \nINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN \nChance returns to his room, changes channels on the television, takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the closet, then goes into the bathroom. \nEXT. GARDEN - MORNING \nCHANCE No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television. \nHAYES How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes? \nCHANCE No. \nChance picks up his slippers and leads the attorneys outside. \nEXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON \nChance describes his garden with pride as they walk toward the rear building. \nCHANCE (points) Those trees were very young when I first arrived. \nFRANKLIN Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance? \nCHANCE No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers. \nHAYES Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance? \nCHANCE No. (points to wall) That's where Joe fixed the bricks. \nThey arrive at the rear building and Chance opens the door to the garage. Franklin and Hayes follow him inside. \nINT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON \nFranklin and Hayes are taken aback by the touring car. \nFRANKLIN (admires car) ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance? \nCHANCE No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile. \nHAYES (amazed) You never been in a car? \nChance is silent for a moment, he blushes slightly. \nCHANCE ... Well... From time to time I did sit in it... Just in here... It hasn't been outside since the Old Man hurt himself. (he turns) I live in here. \nChance moves toward his room, Franklin and Hayes follow. \nINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON \nChance sits on the bed to remove his boots as Hayes and Franklin inspect the room. \nCHANCE The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control. (he turns it on with the remote) He has one just like it. \nFRANKLIN Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased. \nCHANCE Yes, I understand. \nChance puts on his slippers, crosses to the closet, opens the door. It is filled with men's wear. \nCHANCE I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats. \nHAYES It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style. \nCHANCE Yes. I have seen styles on television. \nFRANKLIN (getting back to business) What are your plans now, Mr. Chance? \nCHANCE I would like to stay and work in my garden. \nChance turns to watch TV. Franklin takes Hayes to a side of the room. \nFRANKLIN (quietly) ... What do you make of all this? \nHAYES I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming... \nFRANKLIN (looks at Chance) ... Yeah... \nHAYES ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think... \nFRANKLIN Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure... (he unzips briefcase) ... Let's just keep everything legal. \nFranklin takes out some papers, approaches Chance. \nFRANKLIN Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate. \nCHANCE Yes. I understand. (he takes out his remote control TV changer) If I see Raphael I will tell him. \nChance points the changer at Abbaz and clicks it three times, tries to change the picture. Abbaz immediately pulls out a switchblade, whips the blade open. \nABBAZ (holds knife at Chance) Now, move, honkie! Before I cut your white ass! \nChance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns it to his pocket. \nCHANCE Yes. Of course. (as he leaves) Good day. \nAbbaz, Lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz with excitement: \"Who the fuck died?\" \"Why'd he pull that changer on us, man?\" \"The Old Man died, must be Papa Joe!\" \"He's some weird honkie, man.\" \nEXT. CHINATOWN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON \nA Bulletin board affixed to a storefront in Chinatown. Chance gazes at the notes pinned to it, written in Chinese. Smiling, he turns from it, walks on through the area. \nEXT. PORNO AREA - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON \nA street lined with adult book stores, X-rated movies and strip joints. An elderly Black woman approaches carrying a bag of groceries. Chance steps in front of the woman, stops her. \nCHANCE I'm very hungry now. Would you please bring me my lunch? \nThe woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened. She turns and half-runs into a sleazy bar for safety. Chance watches after her for a moment, then continues along. \nEXT. PARK - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON \nChance stands looking through a chain-link fence watching some teenage boys playing basketball. He bangs on the fence, calls to them. \nCHANCE I have seen your game! I have watched Elvin Hayes play it many times! They call him \"Big E!\" \nThe boys ignore him, Chance walks away. \nEXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON \nChance walks down the center meridian of a divided street. He seems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either side. In the background can be seen the Washington Monument. \nEXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON \nChance seems stumped on which way to go. He looks up one street, then the other, has no idea where they lead. He turns, looks behind him and sees a large statue of Benito Juarez pointing. Chance smiles and goes off in the direction that Benito points. \nEXT. REAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DUSK \nTourists are gathered around gaping through the fence at the White House. Chance is turned the other way, inspecting the branches of a dying tree. Chance moves to a POLICEMAN standing nearby. \nCHANCE Excuse me... (points to tree) ... That tree is very sick. It should be cared for. \nThe Policeman looks at the tree, then at Chance, figures a man dressed that well must be important. \nPOLICEMAN Yes sir. I'll report it right away. \nCHANCE Yes. That would be a good thing to do. Good day. \nPOLICEMAN Good day. \nThe Policeman takes out his walkie-talkie as Chance walks away. \nEXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - EVENING \nA fashionable area. Expensive shops, well-kept streets and sidewalks. A television store has caught Chance's eye. He stands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color TVs, all turned on, playing various channels. A video camera points outward from a corner of the window and is focused on the sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves live on an Advent TV. Chance is intrigued by his own image. He poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it is really him on television. He moves forward, smiles, then moves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the screen. He steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness disappears from frame on the Advent. Standing between two parked cars, Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it at the Advent. Four or five other sets in the window change channels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen. As he does this, the car to his,left, a large, American-made limousine, backs up. The car bumps Chance, pins him against the car to his right. Chance cries out in pain, drops his suitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the limo. The chauffeur, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY, immediately jump from the car, run back to Chance. \nDAVID I'm very sorry, sir... I... \nDavid and Jeffrey reach out to help, but Chance is wedged solidly between the two cars. \nCHANCE (in pain) ... I can't move... My leg... \nDAVID (rushes back to limo) ... My Lord... \nJEFFREY This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured... \nCHANCE No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore. \nDavid pulls the car forward, freeing Chance. A few bystanders begin to gather as Jeffrey helps Chance to the sidewalk. \nJEFFREY Can you walk? It's not broken, is it? \nCHANCE (leans against limo, holds leg) It's very sore. \nCHANCE (doesn't understand) Your family doctor? \nEVE Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated... \nCHANCE I agree. \nEVE Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you... (leans forward) David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know? \nJEFFREY Yes ma'am. \nEve presses a button, the glass partition closes. As the window rolls up behind him, Jeffrey dials the limo telephone. \nThere is a moment of silence. Eve, still a bit on edge from the accident and feeling a bit uncomfortable with a stranger in the car, presses another button. The limo's bar moves out, revealing a row of decanters and glasses. \nEVE Would you care for a drink? \nCHANCE Yes. Thank you. \nAs Eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass, Chance notices the limo's TV set. \nCHANCE (CONT'D) I would like to watch television. \nEVE (a bit surprised) Oh? Certainly... \nShe hands Chance the cognac, turns on the TV. \nEVE (CONT'D) Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand. \nCHANCE Hello, Eve. \nChance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed to alcohol, coughs. There is another moment of silence. \nEVE May I ask your name? \nCHANCE (with a slight cough) My name is Chance. \nEVE Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance? \nCHANCE (still indistinct) No. I'm a gardener. \nEVE Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you? \nCHANCE No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita. \nEVE Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often. \nChance reaches out to change the channel on the TV, suddenly realizes he doesn't have his remote control. He starts going through his pockets, searches for it. \nEVE (CONT'D) Did you lose something? \nCHANCE Yes. I lost my remote control. \nEVE Oh... Well, I'm very sorry... \nAnother pause, Chance reaches out, changes channels on TV. \nEVE (CONT'D) ... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer... (Chance still watches TV) ... Is there anything special you would like to watch? \nCHANCE I like to watch. This is fine. \nChance watches the news. Eve sips on her cognac as David eases the limo out of the city of Washington. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - WOODED AREA - NIGHT \nThe limo approaches, then turns into the entrance-way of the Rand Estate. Two guards stand on either side of the open gate, salute as the car passes through. \nEXT. RAND DRIVE - NIGHT \nThe drive runs alongside a stream, then turns and crosses a large meadow. The limousine passes, still no sign of the house. It is a very, very long driveway. \nINT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nChance is glued to the TV, switches channels, again watches the news. Eve takes his fascination with television as a sign of intelligence. \nEVE I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events. \nCHANCE Yes. \nRAND Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well. \nEVE No headaches? \nRAND No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told. \nEVE (holds his hand against her cheek) You heard? \nRAND I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that. \nEVE Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable. \nRAND Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner? \nEVE (sits on the side of the bed) Do you feel well enough for that? \nRAND (smiles) Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man? \nThere is silence from Eve. Rand squeezes her hand, turns to Constance. \nRAND (CONT'D) Constance! I want new blood tonight, I'm getting up for dinner. \nCONSTANCE But, Mr. Rand... \nRAND Don't argue, tell Robert I want new blood! (turns to Eve) ... Ask him to dinner. \nRand pulls Eve's hand close, kisses it. \nINT. EAST WING GUEST SUITE - NIGHT \nAn enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique furniture. DR. ROBERT ALLENBY dabs Chance's ass with a piece of cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection. Chance stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the television which is not turned on. \nALLENBY The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner. \nCHANCE I understand. I've seen it done before. \nALLENBY Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all. \nAllenby administers the injection, Chance reacts from the pain. \nCHANCE You were wrong, it did hurt. \nALLENBY (a chuckle) But not for long... \nAs Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots a remote control for the TV on the bedside table. He reaches out, picks it up. \nALLENBY (CONT'D) It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone. \nCHANCE Yes. I think so, too. \nALLENBY However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after. \nCHANCE I see. \nChance turns on the TV. \nALLENBY (a look to the TV, then to Chance) You can pull your trousers up, now. \nCHANCE Oh, fine. \nALLENBY (as Chance pulls up pants) Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg. (no reaction from Chance, Allenby takes a long look at him) ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out. \nCHANCE (doesn't understand) ... Straight out? \nALLENBY Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's? \nCHANCE (after a beat) Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me. \nALLENBY Thomas? Who's Thomas? \nCHANCE Thomas Franklin, an attorney. \nALLENBY An attorney? \nCHANCE (turns back to TV) Yes. \nALLENBY (suddenly very cold) Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys? \nCHANCE Yes. I like that very much. \nBILLINGS (lining up Chance's leg) This won't take long, Mr. Gardiner. Please hold still when I ask. \nChance stares at Billings, reacts to him being Black. \nCHANCE (to Billings) Do you know Raphael? \nBILLINGS No sir, I don't believe I do. \nCHANCE Oh. I have a message for him. \nBILLINGS Yes, sir. \nCHANCE A Black man gave me the message. \nBILLINGS Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still. \nRand looks over as Billings takes the X-Ray. \nRAND Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner - aplastic anemia. \nChance smiles to Rand. \nRAND (CONT'D) Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease... \nCHANCE (still smiles at Rand) Yes. You look very sick. \nBILLINGS Hold still, please, Mr. Gardiner. \nRAND (a laugh) I am very sick, and, as you can see by all this paraphernalia, I am very wealthy. I think I would rather be wealthy and sick than poor and sick. \nCHANCE (looks around the room) I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television. \nBILLINGS Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner. \nCONSTANCE You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay quiet. \nRand lays his head back. \nRAND ... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology. \nCHANCE I agree. \nRAND (flat on his back) ... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner? \nCHANCE (also flat on his back) Yes. I am very hungry. \nRAND ... So am I, my boy - so am I. \nINT. RAND DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nTHURMAND, a waiter, and MARIANNE, a waitress, enter into the Rand dining room carrying trays of food. The dining room is immense, a 70-foot ceiling, huge fireplace. Allenby, Eve, Rand, and Chance (both in wheelchairs) sit around the table. Rand speaks slowly, with obvious weakness. \nRAND I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country! \nALLENBY To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence. \nRAND Of course! By kid-lawyers! \nEve turns to Chance. \nEVE Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner? \nCHANCE No. It won't do that. \nEVE ... Would you like us to notify anyone for you? \nCHANCE No. The Old Man died and Louise left. \nThere is a moment of silence. \nEVE Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask. \nRAND Do you need a secretary? \nCHANCE No, thank you. My house has been closed. \nAllenby watches Chance trying to light the cigar as Rand speaks on, shooting pool as he talks. \nRAND ... I'd like to offer the decent 'Gardeners' of the business community a helping hand. After all, they are our strongest defense against the pollutants who so threaten our basic freedoms and the well-being of our middle class. Tell me, would you have any thoughts on such a program? \nChance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at Allenby, then answers Rand. \nCHANCE No, Ben. \nRAND (a smile) Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days. \nCHANCE I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore. \nRAND ... Oh? (looks to Allenby) Robert, take a look, would you? \nALLENBY Some pain is to be expected... (bends to Chance, looks at leg) ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest. (checks watch) ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed. \nRAND (puts down pool cue) We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician! \nCHANCE I agree. \nAllenby laughs as he takes Rand's cigar from him, snuffs it in the ashtray. \nINT. MANSION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nWilson stands behind Chance in the wheelchair. Chance glances slowly and inquisitively around the elevator. When his eyes meet Wilson's, the valet breaks out in laughter. \nWILSON (laughing, trying to apologize) ... Sorry, sir - I just couldn't contain myself... I knew you were going to come out with another one of your jests about the elevator... Excuse me, sir... \nThe elevator stops, the door opens. \nINT. MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT \nWilson wheels Chance out of the elevator. \nCHANCE (looks back as the door closes) ... Hmmm... Elevator. \nWILSON (laughs again) ... Yes sir - elevator! \nWilson stops laughing, becomes the stone-faced servant once again as he notices Eve coming out of her bedroom. Wilson stops wheeling Chance, stands stiffly at attention as Eve and Chance talk. \nEVE Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us. \nCHANCE Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much. \nEVE ... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us. \nCHANCE Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before. \nEVE Yes... I know, Chauncey. \nCHANCE I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man... \nEVE He does...? \nCHANCE Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies? \nEve is not prepared for such a question. \nEVE ... Why... No, I don't think so... \nCHANCE That's good. \nChance smiles at Eve and there is a moment of silence before Eve steps back into her bedroom. \nEVE ... Good night, Chauncey. \nCHANCE Good night, Eve. \nEve closes the door. Wilson wheels Chance down the hallway toward the guest room. \nEXT. FRONT OF RAND MANSION - MORNING \nEve comes out of the house, Jeffrey holds the door for her as she gets into \"RAND l.\" Jeffrey gets in and the limo pulls away. Chance comes out of the front door, walking with a limp. His first view of the Rand grounds in the daylight, he is taken by the extent of the greenery. An attendant, LEWIS, hurries to Chance. \nLEWIS Did you want a car, sir? \nCHANCE Yes. I would like a car. \nCHANCE Yes, I would like to see Ben. \nSMYTHE Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir. \nChance follows Smythe down the hall. \nINT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING \nRand is in an easy chair, dressed for his meeting with the President. The two nurses are working at the disinfecting table. Rand smiles as Chance is shown into the room by Smythe. \nRAND Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you? \nCHANCE Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore. \nRAND Well, that's good news, my boy. \nCHANCE You're looking much better today, Ben. \nRAND Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk. \nCHANCE I understand. \nRAND No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man. \nCHANCE Thank you, Ben. (looks at Rand closely) ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben. \nThe nurses turn, look at Chance. \nEXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING \nWilson is at the head of eight servants lined up on the front steps. Two black PLYMOUTH SEDANS pull up and park. EIGHT MEN in grey business suits get out. One of them, WOLTZ, goes directly to Wilson. \nWOLTZ Good morning, Mr. Wilson. \nWILSON Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice to see you again. \nWOLTZ Thank you. How have you been? \nWILSON Fine, thank you. (hands Woltz paper) We have an additional guest with us today, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner. \nWOLTZ (reads list) I see... (turns to other men) Okay, let's go to work. \nThe eight servants pair up with the eight men in suits and go into the house. \nINT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING \nAllenby gets off the elevator, stands and thinks for a moment, then heads off down the hallway in the direction of Chance's room. \nINT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING \nChance watches television as Rand speaks. \nRAND Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself... \nCHANCE (changing channels) I see, Ben. \nRAND ... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day... \nEXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING \nTwo black limousines followed by a station wagon with small holes in the side pull up in front of the mansion. As men from the first limousine and the station wagon jump out and take positions around the driveway, Lewis hurries to his post, picks up his phone. \nINT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - MORNING \nThe nerve center of the Rand Enterprises since he has become ill. Four or five desks, all the latest electronic office equipment, three TV's with video taping facilities, countless telephones. MRS. AUBREY, Rand's senior secretary, is at her desk, answers her phone. \nMRS. AUBREY (into phone) Yes... Oh, very good, Lewis, thank you. \nMrs. Aubrey hangs up, picks up another phone, pushes a button. \nINT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING \nRand smiles at Chance as the phone rings. \nRAND He's here. (into phone) Yes, Mrs. Aubrey? (listens) Fine. Show the President to the library, we'll be along in a few minutes. \nRand hangs up the phone, turns to Chance with a twinkle in his eyes. \nPRESIDENT Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner... \nCHANCE (sitting) Yes, I will. \nPRESIDENT (also sits) Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to... \nChance perks up at the mention of his name, interrupts. \nCHANCE Yes? \nThere is a beat as the President looks at Chance quizzically, then he continues. \nPRESIDENT I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben. \nRAND Yes, I did. \nPRESIDENT ... Well? \nRAND Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game. \nPRESIDENT Well, Ben... I... \nRAND I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos. \nPRESIDENT That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance. \nCHANCE (again perks up) Yes? \nOnce again, the President gives Chance a puzzled look. \nINT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING \nPerkins accompanies Secret Service Agent RIFF as he checks out the third floor. Riff knocks on each door, looks inside, then moves in. \nINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING \nAllenby is searching through Chancels clothes looking for some sort of identification. There is a knock at the door, Allenby pulls back from the closet as Riff opens the door, looks inside. \nALLENBY Oh... Hello. \nRIFF (entering) Good morning. I'm Riff, Secret Service. \nALLENBY ... Yes. Of course. \nPerkins watches curiously as Riff passes the metal detector over Allenby's clothing. \nINT. LIBRARY - MORNING \nThe President is worried about what Rand is telling him. He paces, smokes a cigarette. Chance smiles through it all. \nRAND ... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible. \nPRESIDENT It's that serious, huh? \nRAND I'm afraid so. \nThe President now looks nearly as bad as Rand. He sits, turns to Chance. \nPRESIDENT Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives? \nCHANCE (a beat) As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden. \nPRESIDENT (a pause) ... In the garden? \nCHANCE That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again... \nPRESIDENT (staring at Chance) ... Spring and summer... (confused) Yes, I see... Fall and winter. (smiles at Chance) Yes, indeed... (a beat) Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner? \nRAND I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy. \nCHANCE Yes. That is correct. \nPRESIDENT (pleased) ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must admit, that is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements I've heard in a very, very long time. \nThe President puts out his cigarette, rises. \nPRESIDENT (CONT'D) ... Many of us forget that nature and society are one! Yes, though we have tried to cut ourselves off from nature, we are still a part of it! Like nature, our economic system remains, in the long run, stable and rational. And that is why we must not fear to be at its mercy! (he smiles at Chance, who is absorbed in looking around the room at the books) ... I envy your good, solid sense, Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely what we lack on Capitol Hill. (glances at watch) I must be going. (holds out hand to Chance) Mr. Gardiner, this visit has been enlightening... \nEVE (approaches Chance, calls) Chauncey! \nCHANCE (stops, turns) Hello, Eve. \nEVE Your leg must be getting better. \nCHANCE Yes. It's feeling much better now. \nEVE Good. I'm glad to hear that. (they walk together) ... How did you like meeting the President? \nCHANCE Fine. He's very nice. \nEVE Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him. \nThey walk along in silence for a moment. Chance sees a huge greenhouse not far from them, heads toward it. Eve turns to him, hesitates, then questions. \nEVE (CONT'D) ... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died. \nCHANCE Yes. \nEVE Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend? \nCHANCE (looking at greenhouse) He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young. \nEVE Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps? \nCHANCE (quizzically) ... Mentor...? \nEve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the Old Man. \nEVE Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him. \nCHANCE Yes. I was. \nEVE I'm sorry... (getting more to the point) ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also? \nCHANCE Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid. \nEVE (relieved) Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with. \nCHANCE Oh, no. She brought me my meals. \nEVE (pleased) Of course. \nEve edges slightly closer to Chance. Chance edges slightly closer to the greenhouse, is fascinated by it. \nCHANCE What is that? \nEVE Our greenhouse. \nCHANCE (pleased) Oh, I like that very much. \nEVE Yes, so do we. \nChance peeks through one of the windows. \nINT. RAND'S BEDROOM - DAY \nRand is in bed. Eve, Chance and Allenby are seated around him, the two nurses standing to one side. They all watch the President's address to the Financial Institute on TV. Chance inhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room. Rand is looking weaker. Every so often, Allenby casts a concerned glance his way. \nPRESIDENT'S VOICE ... And there are so many of you that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial crisis in this nation's history. And there are so many of you demanding that we put into effect drastic measures to alter its course. Well, let me tell you, gentlemen, I have been conducting multiple-level consultations with members of the Cabinet, House and Senate. I have conducted meetings with prominent business leaders throughout the country. And this very morning I had an in-depth discussion with your founder and Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand and his close friend and advisor Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... \nRand perks up a bit at this mention. Allenby manages a smile, once again looks at Rand, checking his condition. Eve looks proudly at Chance, who continues to enjoy the oxygen. \nPRESIDENT'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... Well, gentlemen, I found this to be a most rewarding conference... To quote Mr. Gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'As long as the roots of industry remain firmly planted in the national soil, the economic prospects are undoubtedly sunny.' \nRand starts coughing, breathing heavily. Allenby and the nurses rush to his bedside. Allenby shoots a quick look to Eve and Chance. \nALLENBY (motioning toward door) Excuse us, please. \nEve and Chance leave the room as Allenby administers aid to Rand. \nPRESIDENT'S VOICE Gentlemen, let us not fear the inevitable chill and storms of autumn and winter, instead, let us anticipate the rapid growth of springtime, let us await the rewards of summer. As in a garden of the earth, let us learn to accept and appreciate the times when the trees are bare as well as the times when we pick the fruit. \nEXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - DAY \nEve and Chance sit in silence on the patio. Eve's eyes are swollen, red, she has been crying. She turns to Chance, reaches out, touches his hand. \nCHANCE Hmmm. Elevator. \nHe gets in the elevator. \nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY \nChance looks at the row of buttons, presses one. He smiles as he feels the elevator move. \nINT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT - DAY \nOne of Mrs. Aubrey's secretaries, JENNIFER, waits with an arm load of paperwork for the elevator. The door opens, Chance smiles at her as he steps out. \nJENNIFER (surprised to see him) Why, hello, Mr. Gardiner - are you looking for someone? \nCHANCE No. \nJennifer gets in the elevator, the doors Close. Chance looks around the basement, puzzled. He had expected to be on the third floor. \nINT. MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY \nMrs. Aubrey is at her desk, buzzing her inter-house phone. As Jennifer enters, Mrs. Aubrey hangs up in frustration. \nMRS. AUBREY I can't find Mr. Gardiner anywhere. \nJENNIFER He's in the basement. \nMRS. AUBREY What's he doing in the basement? \nJENNIFER I don't know, Mrs. Aubrey. \nMrs. Aubrey grabs a notepad, leaves the office. \nINT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT - DAY \nMrs. Aubrey comes out of the service elevator, hurries through the basement. She checks: The boiler room. The electrical room. The photographer's studio (Eve is sitting for a portrait) The gym (Allenby is working out) \nINT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT BOWLING ALLEY - DAY \nChance stands in the middle of the two-lane bowling alley, totally confused. Mrs. Aubrey enters, he smiles at her. \nMRS. AUBREY Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over. \nCHANCE Oh, yes. \nMRS. AUBREY Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called. \nCHANCE Yes, I have seen that show on television. \nMRS. AUBREY Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested. \nCHANCE Yes. I would like to be on that show. \nMRS. AUBREY Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice. (Chance nods, there is a pause) ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something? \nCHANCE No. I like this attic very much. \nMrs. Aubrey gives him a look, leaves. \nEXT. SKY - DUSK \nAIR FORCE 1 passes through the clouds. \nINT. AIR FORCE 1 - DUSK \nThe President sits on a couch in one of the compartments on the jet. Before him, stand six of his STAFF, Kaufman included. \nPRESIDENT ... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown. \nKAUFMAN Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to... \nPRESIDENT (interrupts) He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin! \nKAUFMAN Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to... \nPRESIDENT (again interrupts) I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt. (he stands) I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time. (he starts for door) I've got to take a leak. \nKAUFMAN Right, Chief. \nCHANCE (over TV) ... Some plants do well in the sun, and others grow better in the cool of the shade. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT \nA group of ELDERLY BLACK PEOPLE sit in the lobby, watch \"This Evening\" on an old black-and-white TV. \nCHANCE (over TV) ... It is the gardener's responsibility to take water from the flooded area and run it to the area that is dry. It is the gardener's responsibility not to plant a sun-loving flower in the shade of a high wall... \nDuring the preceding speech, Louise, the maid from the Old Man's house, chatters. \nLOUISE Gobbledegook! All the time he talked gobbledegook! An' it's for sure a White man's world in America, hell, I raised that boy since he was the size of a pissant an' I'll say right now he never learned to read an' write - no sir! Had no brains at all, was stuffed with rice puddin' between the ears! Shortchanged by the Lord and dumb as a jackass an' look at him now! Yes, sir - all you gotta be is white in America an' you get whatever you want! Just listen to that boy - gobbledegook! \nThere is a chorus of \"Amens\" as she finishes. \nINT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT \nChance continues. \nCHANCE ... It is the responsibility of the gardener to adjust to the bad seasons as well as enjoy the good ones. If the gardener does his job, everything will be fine. \nINT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nAudience applause is heard over TV. Rand claps weakly along with the TV sound. Eve and Teresa also clap. \nRAND (smiling) Splendid. Just splendid... \nRand looks up as Constance comes into the room. \nRAND (CONT'D) Damn, Constance, get in here! You shouldn't miss any of this! \nConstance hurries to Teresa's side. Rand turns to Eve. \nRAND (CONT'D) I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached... (Eve smiles) ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve. \nEVE (a beat) ... Yes, I am, Ben. \nRAND (reaches out, takes her hand) That's good... That's good. \nDUPONT (over TV) Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others... \nCHANCE (over TV) Thank you. \nINT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT \nDupont asks another question. \nDUPONT I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be? \nCHANCE (with confidence) I am a very serious gardener. \nINT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMore applause over the TV. The President pales. \nPRESIDENT Oh, Jesus... \nHe rolls over in bed. The First Lady reaches out, puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. \nINT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nFranklin holds a phone to his ear with one hand, shuts off the TV with the other. \nFRANKLIN Okay, I'll see you in twenty minutes. \nFranklin hangs up the phone, scurries around getting dressed. His wife, Johanna, sits grimly in bed. \nJOHANNA (coldly) ... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar... \nFRANKLIN Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner... \nJOHANNA (turns over in bed) Good night. \nFRANKLIN Look, Johanna... \nJOHANNA (cuts him off) I said good night! \nFranklin gives up, hurries from the room. \nCHANCE Certainly, Ben. \nRAND Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve? \nCHANCE Yes. I would like to escort Eve. \nRAND Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip. \nEVE (with a blush) ... Ben, really... \nRAND (reaches out a tired hand to Chance - Chance holds it) ... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much. (takes back hand) ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours. \nEve and Chance quietly leave the room. Allenby watches Chance go, then readies Rand for the injection. \nINT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe elevator door opens, Eve and Chance come into the hallway. Chance looks back at the elevator for a beat, then the two walk quietly down the hall. \nEVE (stopping by bedroom door) ... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you? \nCHANCE No, thank you. \nEVE Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie. \nCHANCE I see. \nEVE (a pause, softly) ... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older... \nEve gives Chance a long look, then kisses him on the lips. She steps back, smiles. \nEVE (CONT'D) ... Good night, Chauncey. \nCHANCE Good night, Eve. \nEve goes into her bedroom, closes the door. Chance heads for his room as though nothing had happened. \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE ANTE ROOM - MORNING \nKaufman and the five other Aides nervously await the President's arrival. The door opens, the President briskly enters the room. \nPRESIDENT Good morning, gentlemen. \nAIDES (as one) Good morning, sir. \nThe President leads the way into the Oval Office. \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING \nAs the President goes to his desk, Kaufman hands him a folder. The President sits, reads it quickly, it is very brief. \nPRESIDENT (to Kaufman) This is not what I requested. \nKAUFMAN No, sir. \nPRESIDENT This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that. \nKAUFMAN Right, Chief. \nPRESIDENT So...? Where the hell is it? \nKAUFMAN We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh... \nPRESIDENT What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman? \nKAUFMAN Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent. \nPRESIDENT I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman. \nKAUFMAN Yes, sir. \nKaufman takes a clipboard from the man at his right. \nKAUFMAN (CONT'D) (reading) Suits hand-made by a tailor in Chicago in 1918. The tailor went out of business in 1929, then took his own life. ... His shoes were hand-made in 1928. The cobbler has long since been dead. Underwear, all of the finest cloth, factory destroyed by fire in 1938. The man carries no identification; no wallet, no driver's license, no credit cards. ... He carries one item along with him, a fine Swiss pocket-watch crafted at the turn of the century; so far they have been unable to ascertain where or when purchase was made. ... He has never dyed his hair. ... Computers have analyzed Gardiner's vocal characteristics; it is impossible to determine his ethnic background, they feel his accent may be northeastern, but they will not commit to that. ... Fingerprint check proved negative, no identification possible. (a pause) ... That's it, Mr. President. \nThe President stares at Kaufman for a beat, then speaks into his intercom. \nPRESIDENT (into intercom) Miss Davis - I'd like my eggs poached this morning, please. \nCHANCE Yes, Eve. I shall yield too. \nEVE (smiling) I'll be back soon... \nEve and Sophie leave. Skrapinov leads his wife and Chance to their table. \nSKRAPINOV (as they walk) I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President. (quietly) ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail. \nCHANCE Ben is very ill. \nSKRAPINOV Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover. (arrive at table) Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner. \nChance sits between Skrapinov and Mrs. Skrapinov. \nSKRAPINOV (CONT'D) (moves chair close to Chance) ... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often? \nCHANCE Yes, I agree, I think so too. \nSKRAPINOV To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy? \nCHANCE Yes, I understand. \nSKRAPINOV And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far! \nCHANCE (an engaging smile) We are not far... (motions at nearness of their chairs) ... our chairs almost touch. \nSKRAPINOV (laughs) Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree? \nCHANCE I certainly do. \nSKRAPINOV Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you. \nCHANCE Do you think so? Do you think so? \nSKRAPINOV So you know Krylov! \nSkrapinov pauses, then leans close to Chance, speaks softly in Russian. Chance, having never heard this language, raises his eyebrows and laughs. Mrs. Skrapinov remains impassive. \nSKRAPINOV (CONT'D) (amazed) So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one! \nCHANCE Oh, good. \nSKRAPINOV Yes, it is very good! \nCHANCE Yes, it is. (beat) Would you tell me your name again, please? \nSKRAPINOV (slaps Chance on the back) Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov! \nCHANCE Yes. I like that name very much. \nSKRAPINOV And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner! (in Russian) How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend! \nAs he speaks in Russian, Eve comes to the table, taps Skrapinov on the shoulder. \nSKRAPINOV (CONT'D) (immediately rises) Mrs. Rand! You have returned to us! \nEVE Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if I might. (to Chance) Everyone wants to meet you. \nCHANCE Yes, Eve. That would be good. \nSKRAPINOV (shakes Chance's hand) We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times! \nCHANCE Thank you. \nAs Eve and Chance leave, Skrapinov turns and nods to a MAN standing a short distance away. The man, KARPATOV, hurries to the table. \nSKRAPINOV Yes? What have you found? \nKARPATOV (in Russian) We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov. \nSKRAPINOV (holds up hand, looks around) Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language. \nKARPATOV (in English, softly) Sorry, Comrade Ambassador. \nSKRAPINOV What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible. \nKARPATOV There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government. \nRAND (speaks slowly, with effort) Everything. I said everything and that's exactly what I mean. \nMONROE But, Mr. Rand, the holdings are so extensive, I would like to be more precise in... \nRAND (interrupts) What could be more precise than everything...? \nAllenby enters the room, stands by the door, unnoticed. \nMONROE (turns to Townsend) Everything to Mrs. Rand. \nTOWNSEND (drafting a will) Right - everything. \nRAND You two don't have to lecture me on the complexities of the situation, no one knows that better than myself... But you must understand that I have an endless faith in Mrs. Rand's abilities - I know that she will select the right person for guidance when she has the need... She has shared my life, gentlemen, she has given me far more pleasure than any of my so called assets... Life has suddenly become very simple for me now - I may be older than my years, and you might think me to be somewhat feeble... But I am still in love, gentlemen, thank God for that... \nAllenby silently leaves the room. \nINT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - DINNER PARTY - NIGHT \nDennis Watson, of the State Department, talks with Chance in a corner of the living room. Dennis whispers something into Chance's ear and Chance gives him an innocent smile. Dennis is encouraged by the smile. \nDENNIS We could do it now, we can go upstairs. (no reaction from Chance) ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs. \nCHANCE (blankly) I like to watch. \nDENNIS Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone? \nCHANCE Yes. I like to watch very much. \nDENNIS Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too. (takes Chance's arm) We can go this way. \nCHANCE I want to tell Eve. \nDENNIS Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand? \nCHANCE Yes. \nDENNIS (pulling Chance) Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd. \nDennis leads Chance out of the crowded room. \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA light from the adjoining bathroom filters into the darkened bedroom. The President and the First Lady are in bed. They each lie on their backs, a distance apart and are silent. \nFIRST LADY (after some time) ... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling. \nPRESIDENT No, that won't do any good. \nFIRST LADY (another pause) ... Is it me? Is there something I've done? \nPRESIDENT Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you... \nFIRST LADY (another pause) It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator... \nPRESIDENT It's not that, I just... \nThe inter-White House phone rings, the President reaches for it. \nPRESIDENT (CONT'D) (into phone) Yeah, Kaufman - what is it? \nKAUFMAN'S VOICE (over phone) Chief, we have a break in the case. Our man at the Washington Post says they are working on a story that either the CIA or the FBI destroyed Gardiner's files before anyone could get to them. \nPRESIDENT What? Why? \nKAUFMAN'S VOICE (over phone) I can't say at this time - neither agency will admit to a thing. \nPRESIDENT (getting out of bed) Okay, get both Directors over here, I'll be right down. \nThe President hangs up the phone as the First Lady stares at the ceiling. \nINT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT \nA small room exquisitely decorated in pale lilac tapestry. The lights are very dim, and Dennis, who we cannot see, is lying on the floor. Dennis' clothes are draped over a chair. Chance sees a very small pocket television on a desk. He turns the TV on. \nDENNIS' VOICE (softly) Can you see well? \nCHANCE (squints at small screen) Yes, very well, thank you. \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe President sits behind his desk in a bathrobe, his hair mussed. Standing before him are GROVER HONEYCUTT, the Director of the F.B.I., and CLIFFORD BALDWIN, C.I.A. Chief. Kaufman stands to one side. All are red-eyed, tired, and frustrated. \nHONEYCUTT I never gave such a directive, Mr. President. \nBALDWIN Nor I, sir - it would be out of the question. \nPRESIDENT Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers. \nBALDWIN Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out. \nPRESIDENT Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...? \nThere is silence in the room. A couple of looks, but silence. \nPRESIDENT (CONT'D) I see. What about question three? Is it possible to erase all traces of a man? \nHONEYCUTT Highly unlikely, sir... In fact, the boys around the Bureau feel that the only person capable of pulling it off would be an ex F.B.I. man. \nBALDWIN (a look to Honeycutt) I don't think that's entirely true, Grover. \nPRESIDENT (to Baldwin) And what do the boys around Intelligence think? \nBALDWIN Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think. \nPRESIDENT (rising) Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations. (goes to door) Good night. \nThe President leaves the Oval Office. \nINT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT \nEve and Chance walk down the hallway. \nEVE (holding his hand) I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey... (stops at her bedroom door) ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you... \nCHANCE Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise. \nEVE (opens her door) ... Come in, Chauncey - please come in... \nCHANCE Thank you. \nChance enters, Eve closes the door behind them. \nINT. EVE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nEve turns on a soft lamp, Chance goes directly to her TV, turns it on. \nEVE I can sense that you've been through a lot, Chauncey. But one day, when you feel like it, you'll tell me all about your life... (Chance watches an old movie) ... But, even if you tell me nothing, even if it's too painful for you to reveal your past... \nAs she talks, Chance watches a love scene on TV. The hero gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace. The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's mind. He abruptly turns, takes Eve into his arms and kisses her full on the mouth. Just as abruptly, he turns away and changes channels on TV. \nEVE (breathless) Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so much! \nShe takes Chance in her arms, kisses him wildly. They fall to her bed in an embrace. As she holds him, kisses him, runs her hands over his body, Chance watches television, neither resists nor responds to Eve's caresses. Suddenly she stops, lets her head fall on Chance's chest. \nEVE (CONT'D) ... You don't want me, Chauncey... You don't feel anything for me... Nothing at all... \nChance sits up on the bed, then, feeling her sadness, gently strokes her hair as he looks at TV. \nEVE (CONT'D) I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like... \nCHANCE I like to watch. \nEVE (not understanding) To watch...? To watch me...? \nCHANCE Yes. I like to watch. \nEVE (uncertain) ... Is that all you want...? (a hesitation) ... To watch me...? \nCHANCE Yes. It's very good, Eve. \nEVE ... But I've never done... (another hesitation) ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...? \nEve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bedroom as Chance watches TV. She makes a decision, moves to Chance, kisses him. \nEVE (CONT'D) (getting aroused) Oh, Chauncey... \nChance reaches out, uncovers Rand's face, gently touches the man's forehead, feels the coldness. Allenby eyes him as Chance stays with Rand for a moment, then replaces the sheet. \nCHANCE (turns to Allenby) Will you be leaving now, Robert? \nALLENBY In a day or two, yes. \nCHANCE Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed. \nALLENBY (a moment, a look) ... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr... (a beat) ... Chance...? \nCHANCE Yes. I love Eve very much. \nALLENBY I see... (another beat) ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you? \nCHANCE (brightens) Yes, Robert - I am. (a smile at Allenby) I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert. \nChance leaves the bedroom. Allenby watches him go, then sits back in a chair, his head spinning. \nEXT. RAND MANSION - DAY \nA cloudy, cold day patches of snow are on the ground. The Rand servants are lined up in front of the mansion, listen to funeral services for Rand on a pair of loudspeakers. PAN AROUND, reveal the services being held on a hill overlooking the mansion. Fifty mourners are gathered around the Rand family mausoleum. Chance stands with Eve and Allenby. The President of the United States stands before a microphone. \nPRESIDENT ... Millions of people across the world have heard of the passing of Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately, only relatively few will feel the pain and sadness at such a loss. To most, Benjamin Rand was a legend; to those of us gathered here today, Benjamin was a beloved friend. My personal association with Benjamin dates back many years, and my memories of our friendship will stay with me forever. \nAs the President speaks, Chance turns and walks away. Eve and Allenby watch as he goes into the trees surrounding the area. \nPRESIDENT (CONT'D) I initially came in contact with the Rand name in 1943. 1 was a young lieutenant in the Air Corps, a navigator flying missions over Europe. That plane that I learned to know so well was manufactured by the Rand Aeronautics Corporation. (a beat) Benjamin Rand was an industrial giant, known to be powerful and uncompromising, and yet, on a personal level, we have all felt his warmth and humor... (a beat) ... I would like to share with you a few quotes, and a few feelings from our dear friend. (holds up paper, reads) ... 'I do not regret having political differences with men that I respect; I do regret, however, that our philosophies kept us apart.' ... 'I have no use for those on welfare, no patience whatsoever... But, if I am to be honest with myself, I must admit that they have no use for me, either.' ... 'I was born into a position of extreme wealth, I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty -  I do not know the feelings of being poor, and that is not to know the feelings of the majority of people in this world. For a man in my position, that is inexcusable.' 'Life is a state of mind.' ... 'When I was a boy, I was told that the Lord fashioned us from his own image. That's when I decided to manufacture mirrors.' \nINT. LARGE AUDITORIUM - DAY \nAh auditorium with row upon row of empty seats. Huddled together at one end of the hall are six important businessmen, speaking in hushed tones. JAMES DUDLEY, a powerful industrialist, speaks. \nDUDLEY But what do we know of the man? Nothing! We have no inkling of his past! \nSEWELL NELSON, a corporation chairman, joins in. \nNELSON Correct, and that is an asset. A man's past can cripple him, his background turns into a swamp and invites scrutiny. \nAnother executive, PETER CALDWELL, agrees. \nCALDWELL To this time, he hasn't said anything that could be used against him. \nCHARLIE BOB BENNET, a Texas oil millionaire; \nBENNET Well, I'm certainly open to the thought - it would be sheer lunacy to support the President for another term. \nNELSON No one will go along with that... Look at the facts, gentlemen, the response from his appearance on 'This Evening' was overwhelming; he has excited and awakened the people of this country at a time of despair. \nLYMAN MURRAY, a banker; \nMURRAY He's personable, elusive, yet seemingly honest. He's riding a crest of popularity that builds with every statement. As far as his thinking goes, he appears to be one of us. I firmly believe, gentlemen, that he is our only chance - Mr. Chauncey Gardiner! \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nChance, his umbrella under his arm, walks through the woods. \nEXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY \nThe services are over. Eve, Allenby talk with the President and the First Lady. \nEVE It was very moving, Bobby - thank you so much... \nPRESIDENT We're all going to miss him, Eve... (glances around) ... Where's Mr. Gardiner? \nALLENBY ... He walked off... \nEVE Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief... \nPRESIDENT I can certainly understand that... \nFIRST LADY Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve... \nEVE Thank you, Nancy. \nFIRST LADY I'll call you soon. \nThe President and First Lady head toward their limousine. \n", "test1_input": "Louise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit cases waiting by the door. She stops as she sees TWO MEN in white carrying a stretcher down the main staircase. She notices the ease with which they bring the Old Man's body down the stairs. \nLOUISE ... He used to be a big man... 'Spose he wasted away to about nothin'... (a beat - then she talks to the body of the old Man) ... I guess I'll be goin' off to find me some folks, Old Man... I'm not batty enough to stay around this neighborhood any longer... \nThe stretcher bearers move to the front door. Louise steps in front of them. \nLOUISE (CONT'D) (to stretcher bearers) Wait up! I'm goin' out that door first. \nLouise takes one more look at the covered body, then opens the front door, leaves. \nINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAY \nThe TV plays offstage as Chance washes up in the bathroom. He finishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house slippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves the room. \nEXT. GARDEN - DAY \nChance, carrying his slippers, crosses through the layer of fresh snow to the townhouse. \nINT. DINING ROOM - DAY \nChance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place. He turns on the TV, puts the napkin on his lap. He watches TV for a moment, then turns, looks for Louise. She does not appear so he resumes watching TV. He changes channels, views a wildly exciting FOOTBALL game. At a peak in the excitement, he again switches channels. Chance watches TV News coverage of the PRESIDENT of the United States greeting foreign dignitaries at the White House. CLOSE SHOTS on television reveal that the President uses a two-handed handshake when meeting his guests. Unconsciously, Chance grips one hand with the other, the scene on TV seeming to have 'sunk into' his mind. \nINT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY \nA key is heard in the lock. The door opens and THOMAS FRANKLIN and SALLY HAYES enter. Franklin, an attorney, is in his late thirties, carries a large briefcase. Hayes is younger, attractive, also an attorney. She totes a briefcase, has the look of a modern, liberated woman. Hayes appears to be surprised at the interior of the house. \nHAYES (looks around) ... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it... \nFRANKLIN Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born... \nHAYES ... Would you take me on a tour? \nFRANKLIN Gladly... (he smiles) ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one. \nFranklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they,go off down the hall. \nINT. DINING ROOM - DAY \nChance still watches TV, waits for Louise to serve him. Franklin and Hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room. They are both surprised to see Chance. \nFRANKLIN ... Why... Hello, we thought we heard something... (moves to Chance, hand outstretched) I'm Thomas Franklin. \nChance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in both of his like the President did on TV. \nCHANCE Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener. \nFRANKLIN (a beat) ... The gardener? (thinks it's a joke, laughs) ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes. \nHayes moves to shake Chance's hand. \nHAYES Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you. \nCHANCE (doesn't rise, again shakes with both hands) Yes. \nChance turns back to the TV and Hayes and Franklin exchange looks. \nFRANKLIN (after an uneasy pause) ... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate. \nCHANCE (a smile, totally at ease) Yes, Thomas - I understand. \nAnother period of silence. Franklin and Hayes seem perplexed. \nFRANKLIN ... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment? \nCHANCE Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch. \nFRANKLIN Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here? \nCHANCE Yes. Louise will bring me lunch. \nFRANKLIN Louise?... The maid?... (a look to Hayes) But she should have left earlier today... \nCHANCE (smiles at Hayes) I see... \nFRANKLIN (a beat) ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here? \nCHANCE I live here. \n", "test1_true": "CHANCE Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas? \nFRANKLIN (a beat) ... How long have you been living here? \nCHANCE Ever since I can remember, since I was a child. \nFRANKLIN (doubting) Since you were a child? \nCHANCE Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden. \nHAYES ... Then you really are a gardener? \nCHANCE Yes. \nHAYES Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance. \nCHANCE Oh. Thank you. \nFRANKLIN Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents? \nCHANCE No. \nFRANKLIN How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed? \nCHANCE Compensated...? \nFRANKLIN How were you paid? \nCHANCE I was given meals, and a home... \nHAYES What about money? \nCHANCE I never needed money. \nFranklin steps to the TV, turns it off. \nFRANKLIN Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook? \nCHANCE No, I do not have any of those. \nFRANKLIN Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist? \nCHANCE I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors. \nFRANKLIN ... Joe? Who's Joe? \nCHANCE (turns TV back on) Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952. \nFRANKLIN \nCHANCE (changes channels) Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book. \nHAYES Some pictures...? \nCHANCE Yes. Of men and women. \nHAYES ... Oh. \nFRANKLIN Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago. \nCHANCE Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there. \nFRANKLIN Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine. \nCHANCE Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden. \nFRANKLIN (a beat) ... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance. \nCHANCE You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need? \nFranklin and Hayes exchange looks. \nINT. TOWNHOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - AFTERNOON \nChance puts on his snow-boots as Franklin and Hayes continue their questioning. \nFRANKLIN Have you served in the Army? \n", "test1_id": 2952, "test2_input": "INT. RAND MANSION - CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nConstance is in the closet, searching through Chance's pockets, finding nothing. She takes out a small knife, cuts a label from one of the jackets. Quickly, she examines one of Chance's shoes, copies the name of the shoemaker in a notebook. Constance hurries to the dresser, continues her search. \nINT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR/MAKEUP ROOM  NIGHT \nCOLSON, the makeup man, comes through the corridor carrying a glass of water. He turns into the makeup room, goes to Chance who sits in front of the lights. Hull sits next to Chance, briefs him on the show. Chance has his eyes on a TV monitor, watches the guest preceding him on \"This Evening.\" \nCOLSON (gives Chance water) Here you go, Mr. Gardiner. \nCHANCE Thank you. I'm very thirsty. \nCOLSON Yes, sir - it's hot under those lights. \nColson applies finishing touches to Chance. \nHULL Now, if the host wants to ask you a question, he'll raise his left forefinger to his left eyebrow. (Chance watches TV) Then you'll stop, and he'll say something, and then you'll answer. \nOn the TV, WILLIAM DUPONT, the host, wraps up his talk with his guest. \nCOLSON (a last-minute dab) Okay, Mr. Gardiner, you're all set. \nHull leads Chance out of the makeup room. Colson closes the door, then carefully picks up Chance's water glass, wraps it in Kleenex, puts it in his overcoat pocket. \nINT. TV STATION - \"THIS EVENING\" STUDIO - NIGHT \nWilliam Dupont introduces Chance. \nDUPONT Ladies and gentlemen, our very distinguished quest, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner! \nThe BAND plays as Chance comes onto the stage. An audience of about three hundred applauds Chance as he appears. Two TV cameras move with him as he walks, with a smile and a limp, to center stage. Dupont shakes Chance's hand, Chance holds Dupont's hand with both of his own. \nDUPONT (CONT'D) Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening. \nCHANCE Yes. \nDUPONT (showing Chance to chair) I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President. \nCHANCE (sits) You're welcome. \nDUPONT (also sitting) I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown. \nCHANCE Yes. That is surprising. \nDUPONT (a beat) ... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on. \nCHANCE (doesn't understand) I hope so. \nDUPONT Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that. \nCHANCE No. I don't object. \nDUPONT Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy? \nCHANCE Which view? \nApplause and laughter from the audience. Dupont accustomed to parrying with his guests, asks again. \nDUPONT Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not? \nCHANCE Yes. I was there with Ben. \nDUPONT I know that, Mr. Gardiner. \nCHANCE Yes. \nDUPONT (a beat) Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief? \nCHANCE Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds. \nThe audience applauds Chance's apparent metaphor. Dupont waits for it all to subside, then asks another question. \nINT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nRand is in bed. Eve sits in a chair next to the bed, squeezes Rand's hand in excitement as they both watch Chance on television. Teresa, the nurse, watches in the background. \nDUPONT (over TV) ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, that was very well put indeed, and I feel it was a booster for all of us who do not like to wallow in complaints or take delight in gloomy predictions. \n", "test2_true": "The President and First Lady are in bed together watching the show. \nPRESIDENT Gloomy predictions? That insolent son of a bitch! \nDUPONT (over TV) Let's make it clear, Mr. Gardiner, it's your view that the collapse of the Stock Market, the dramatic increase in unemployment, you feel that this is just another season, so to speak, in the garden? \nThe First Lady cuddles close the President, ruffles his hair, tries to cheer him up. \nINT. TV STUDIO - \"THIS EVENING SHOW\" - NIGHT \nChance answers. \nCHANCE In a garden, things grow - but first some things must wither; some trees lose their leaves before they grow new leaves... \nINT. CIA ROOM - NIGHT \nA small, dark room. A videotape machine is running. Also, a machine is turning that records the harmonics of Chance's voice. TWO CIA MEN run the equipment, watch as a needle charts Chance's voice onto paper. \nCHANCE (over TV) ... Then they grow thicker and stronger and taller. Some trees die, but fresh saplings replace them. Gardens need a lot of care and a lot of love. \nINT. THOMAS FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nFranklin, the attorney that evicted Chance, comes out of the bathroom brushing his teeth. His wife, JOHANNA, is in bed absorbed in \"This Evening.\" Franklin sits on the end of the bed, watches the show. \nCHANCE (over TV) ... And if you give your garden a lot of love, and if you work very hard and have a lot of patience, in the proper season you will see it grow to be very beautiful... \nMore applause from the TV. Franklin leans closer to the set. \nFRANKLIN (puzzled) It's that gardener! \nJOHANNA Yes, Chauncey Gardiner. \nFRANKLIN No! He's a real gardener! \nJOHANNA (laughs) He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant. \nDUPONT (over TV) I think your metaphors are quite interesting, Mr. Gardiner, but, haven't we seen seasons that have been devastating to certain countries? \nINT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe President and First Lady continue to watch. \nDUPONT (over TV) Such as disasterous winters, prolonged droughts that have wiped out crops, hurricanes that have all but swept away island communities? Doesn't a country need to have someone in charge that can see it through such crises? \nPRESIDENT ... That bastard... \nThe First Lady moves closer to him. \nINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe TV, its volume low, plays in the background as Constance, with a pair of tweezers, plucks a hair from Chance's pillow, puts it into a small vial. \nDUPONT (over TV) Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good? \nCHANCE (over TV) Yes. We need a very good gardener. \nINT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT \nDupont continues his questions. \nDUPONT Do you feel that we have a 'Very good gardener' in office at this time, Mr. Gardiner? \nAt the end of the question, Dupont glances over Chance's shoulder to look at the monitor. \nCHANCE (a beat) I understand. \nChance turns to see what Dupont is looking at, sees the back of his own head on the TV screen. \nDUPONT I realize that might be a difficult question for you, Mr. Gardiner - but there are a lot of us around the country that would like to hear your thoughts on the matter. \nChance is still turned to the monitor. \nCHANCE Oh, yes. It is possible for one side of the garden to be flooded, and the other side to be dry... \nINT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAllenby watches Chance on television. The camera that covered Dupont in close-up has now pulled back, includes Dupont and Chance, both looking into camera. Allenby is concerned, he is unsure of Chance. \n", "test2_id": 2953, "test3_input": "CHANCE (smiling for photogs) I didn't read it. \nREPORTER #2 (surprised) But air - you must have at least glanced at it. \nCHANCE No. I did not glance at it. \nREPORTER #3 Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of optimism,' what was your reaction to that? \nCHANCE (continues to pose for pictures) I did not read that either. \nREPORTER #3 Well, how do you feel about that phrase, 'Peculiar brand of optimism?' \nCHANCE I do not know what it means. \nREPORTER #2 Sorry to persist, air, but it would be of great interest to me to know what newspapers you do read. \nCHANCE I do not read any newspapers. I watch TV. \nThere is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this. The TV Reporter smiles, questions Chance. \nTV REPORTER ... Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that you find television's coverage of the news superior to that of the newspapers? \nCHANCE (flatly) I like to watch TV. \nTV REPORTER (pleased) ) Thank you, Mr. Gardiner, for what is probably the most honest admission to come from a public figure in years. Few men in public life have the courage not to read newspapers none have the guts to admit it. \nCHANCE You're welcome. \nEve and Chance walk toward the front door, leaving the newsmen to talk among themselves. \nEVE I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it. \nCHANCE Thank you, Eve. \nThe front door is opened for them by an attendant. \nINT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING \nThe Black Tie reception is in progress. The house is crowded, possibly a hundred guests, mostly foreign ambassadors and other such dignitaries. Eve and Chance enter, are greeted by DENNIS WATSON, a State Department official. \nWATSON Mrs. Rand, how good to see you. \nEVE Mr. Watson. \nWATSON (looks to Chance) And you must be Mr. Gardiner, correct? \nCHANCE Yes. \nEVE Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department. \nCHANCE (they shake) Hello, Dennis. \nWATSON A pleasure to meet you, sir. \nCHANCE Yes. It is. \nSOPHIE, an older woman bedecked with jewelry, approaches, embraces Eve. \nSOPHIE Eve, child! How nice of you to come. \nEVE Hello, Sophie. \nSophie steps back, looks at Chance. \nSOPHIE And look who you brought with! \nEVE Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner... \nSOPHIE (hugs Chance) Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner! \nEVE Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley. \nCHANCE (being hugged) Hello, Sophia. \nSOPHIE (steps back, admires Chance) Sophie, please - call me Sophie! \nSophie pulls them both into the party, leaving Dennis looking after Chance as he walks away. \n", "test3_true": "They disappear into the crowd. \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe President is hunched over his desk, absorbed in constructing a model airplane, a World War II flying fortress bomber. The First Lady sits nearby, plays solitaire on a small table. The President glances to her, then back to his work. \nPRESIDENT (gluing the wing) ... How are the kids getting along? \nFIRST LADY Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy... \nPRESIDENT Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack? \nFIRST LADY Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you... \nPRESIDENT Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as... \nA KNOCK at the door interrupts the President. \nPRESIDENT (CONT'D) (calls out) ... Yes, come in! \nKaufman enters. \nKAUFMAN Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments. \nPRESIDENT Oh? What? \nKAUFMAN We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time. \nPRESIDENT Good. Anything else? \nKAUFMAN Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted. \nThe President nods, Kaufman leaves. The President puts some more glue on the wing. \nINT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT \nSophie pulls Eve and Chance to AMBASSADOR SKRAPINOV and his WIFE. Skrapinov smiles as he sees Eve. \nSKRAPINOV Mrs. Rand. How delightful. \nSkrapinov kisses Eve's hand. \nEVE It seems like ages, Mr. Ambassador. (a nod to his wife) Mrs. Skrapinov. \nMrs. Skrapinov returns the nod as Sophie introduces Chance. \nSOPHIE Mr. Gardiner, let me introduce you to our guest of honor, His Excellency Vladimar Skrapinov, Ambassador of the Soviet Union. \nChance warmly shakes Skrapinov's hand with both of his own. \nCHANCE (stumbles over name) Hello... His... His... \nSOPHIE Ambassador Skrapinov, this is Mr. Chauncey Gardiner. \nSKRAPINOV Delighted. Delighted. \nSOPHIE And this is Mrs. Skrapinov. \nChance smiles at Mrs. Skrapinov as The Ambassador puts an arm around him. \nSKRAPINOV You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss. \nCHANCE I agree. \nSKRAPINOV (to Eve) How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling? \nEVE He's doing as well as could be expected, Mr. Ambassador. He still speaks of the stimulating discussions he's had with you. \nSKRAPINOV Ah, Yes. Please give him my regards. \nEVE Of course. \nSOPHIE (tugs at Eve) Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you. \nEVE (to Chance and Skrapinov) Would you two excuse me for a moment? \nSKRAPINOV Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others. \n", "test3_id": 2954}

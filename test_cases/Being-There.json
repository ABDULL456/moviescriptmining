{"test1_input": "RAND Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well. \nEVE No headaches? \nRAND No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told. \nEVE (holds his hand against her cheek) You heard? \nRAND I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that. \nEVE Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable. \nRAND Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner? \nEVE (sits on the side of the bed) Do you feel well enough for that? \nRAND (smiles) Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man? \nThere is silence from Eve. Rand squeezes her hand, turns to Constance. \nRAND (CONT'D) Constance! I want new blood tonight, I'm getting up for dinner. \nCONSTANCE But, Mr. Rand... \nRAND Don't argue, tell Robert I want new blood! (turns to Eve) ... Ask him to dinner. \nRand pulls Eve's hand close, kisses it. \nINT. EAST WING GUEST SUITE - NIGHT \nAn enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique furniture. DR. ROBERT ALLENBY dabs Chance's ass with a piece of cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection. Chance stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the television which is not turned on. \nALLENBY The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner. \nCHANCE I understand. I've seen it done before. \nALLENBY Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all. \nAllenby administers the injection, Chance reacts from the pain. \nCHANCE You were wrong, it did hurt. \nALLENBY (a chuckle) But not for long... \nAs Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots a remote control for the TV on the bedside table. He reaches out, picks it up. \nALLENBY (CONT'D) It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone. \nCHANCE Yes. I think so, too. \nALLENBY However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after. \nCHANCE I see. \nChance turns on the TV. \nALLENBY (a look to the TV, then to Chance) You can pull your trousers up, now. \nCHANCE Oh, fine. \nALLENBY (as Chance pulls up pants) Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg. (no reaction from Chance, Allenby takes a long look at him) ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out. \nCHANCE (doesn't understand) ... Straight out? \nALLENBY Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's? \nCHANCE (after a beat) Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me. \nALLENBY Thomas? Who's Thomas? \nCHANCE Thomas Franklin, an attorney. \nALLENBY An attorney? \nCHANCE (turns back to TV) Yes. \nALLENBY (suddenly very cold) Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys? \n", "test1_true": "ALLENBY (gives Chance a look) Oh, I see... (warms up) ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit... \nCHANCE (changes channels, sits on bed) Thank you. \nALLENBY Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere. \nCHANCE Yes, I could stay here. Thank you. \nALLENBY Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician? \nCHANCE No. \nAllenby waits for Chance to say more, he does not. Finally, Allenby picks up his bag, heads for the door. \nALLENBY (stops by door) I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort. \nCHANCE (clicking changer) Yes, I will. \nAllenby gives him a look, then leaves. Chance watches an old movie of a man lighting a cigar. The man enjoys the cigar, blows out smoke. The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's mind. \nEXT. MANSION - PATIO - NIGHT \nEve sits next to a roaring patio fireplace with a steaming cup of tea. Allenby comes outside, joins her. \nALLENBY Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here. \nEVE I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner? \nALLENBY A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days. \nEVE Stay here? Is that necessary? \nALLENBY Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man. \nEVE Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington. \nALLENBY How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace. \nEVE He's very intense, and internal, don't you think? \nALLENBY At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor. \nEVE Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days. (Eve puts down her tea) ... Robert... Is there any improvement...? \nALLENBY No, Eve... I'm sorry. \nEve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness. \nEVE ... Sometimes when I see Ben I could swear that he's getting stronger... Something that he might say, the way he moves, or a look in his eyes - makes me feel that this is all a nightmare and that he'll be better soon... It's just so hard to believe what's really happening... \nAllenby reaches out, holds Eve's hand. \nINT. RAND MANSION - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe elevator door opens, Wilson guides Chance in the wheelchair into the hallway. \nCHANCE (looks back to elevator) ... That is a very small room. \nWILSON (laughs) Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house. \nCHANCE (glancing around) Yes. It seems to be. \nWilson takes this as another joke, chuckles as he wheels Chance toward Rand's hospital room. \nINT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nCONSTANCE and another nurse, TERESA, stand by as Rand is being given a transfusion. Rand lifts his head as Wilson wheels Chance into the room. \nRAND Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner. \nCHANCE (looks around room) ... I see. \nWilson pushes Chance to the X-Ray machine, where the technician, BILLINGS, a Black man, waits. As Wilson and Billings help Chance onto the X-Ray table, Chance's face brightens up. \nCHANCE (CONT'D) I feel very good in here. \nRAND Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up. \n", "test1_id": 2952, "test2_input": "CHANCE Yes, Eve. I shall yield too. \nEVE (smiling) I'll be back soon... \nEve and Sophie leave. Skrapinov leads his wife and Chance to their table. \nSKRAPINOV (as they walk) I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President. (quietly) ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail. \nCHANCE Ben is very ill. \nSKRAPINOV Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover. (arrive at table) Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner. \nChance sits between Skrapinov and Mrs. Skrapinov. \nSKRAPINOV (CONT'D) (moves chair close to Chance) ... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often? \nCHANCE Yes, I agree, I think so too. \nSKRAPINOV To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy? \nCHANCE Yes, I understand. \nSKRAPINOV And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far! \nCHANCE (an engaging smile) We are not far... (motions at nearness of their chairs) ... our chairs almost touch. \nSKRAPINOV (laughs) Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree? \nCHANCE I certainly do. \nSKRAPINOV Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you. \nCHANCE Do you think so? Do you think so? \nSKRAPINOV So you know Krylov! \nSkrapinov pauses, then leans close to Chance, speaks softly in Russian. Chance, having never heard this language, raises his eyebrows and laughs. Mrs. Skrapinov remains impassive. \nSKRAPINOV (CONT'D) (amazed) So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one! \nCHANCE Oh, good. \nSKRAPINOV Yes, it is very good! \nCHANCE Yes, it is. (beat) Would you tell me your name again, please? \nSKRAPINOV (slaps Chance on the back) Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov! \nCHANCE Yes. I like that name very much. \nSKRAPINOV And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner! (in Russian) How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend! \nAs he speaks in Russian, Eve comes to the table, taps Skrapinov on the shoulder. \nSKRAPINOV (CONT'D) (immediately rises) Mrs. Rand! You have returned to us! \nEVE Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if I might. (to Chance) Everyone wants to meet you. \nCHANCE Yes, Eve. That would be good. \nSKRAPINOV (shakes Chance's hand) We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times! \nCHANCE Thank you. \nAs Eve and Chance leave, Skrapinov turns and nods to a MAN standing a short distance away. The man, KARPATOV, hurries to the table. \nSKRAPINOV Yes? What have you found? \nKARPATOV (in Russian) We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov. \nSKRAPINOV (holds up hand, looks around) Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language. \nKARPATOV (in English, softly) Sorry, Comrade Ambassador. \nSKRAPINOV What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible. \nKARPATOV There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government. \n", "test2_true": "SKRAPINOV But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week? \nKARPATOV Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success. \nSKRAPINOV I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance. \nKARPATOV Clearly, yes comrade. \nSKRAPINOV Hmmm... Take this down. (Karpatov takes out notepad) I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that \"Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes.\"' \nKARPATOV Very good, Your Excellency. \nKarpatov leaves the table. \nINT. WASHINGTON, D.C. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT \nThe same lounge as before. Sidney Courtney sits at the same table as earlier, only this time with the editor of the Washington Post, LYMAN STUART. Courtney puffs on his pipe as he speaks. \nCOURTNEY ... It's strictly rumor at this stage, Lyman - just something in the wind... \nSTUART Something rather big in the wind, I'd say. So whose files were destroyed? The CIA's or the FBI's? \nCOURTNEY I don't know. Like I said, it's just rumor so far, but we should start nosing around, see if we can talk to some people... \nThe CAMERA begins to slowly MOVE AWAY from their table. \nSTUART ... But why? The question is why? Why would they destroy Gardiner's files? What is it about his past they are trying to cover up? (his voice fades) ... A criminal record? A membership in a subversive organization? Homosexual, perhaps? \nThe SOUND of Stuart's voice dissolves into Thomas Franklin's as the CAMERA SETTLES on Dr. Allenby and Franklin sitting at a table nearby. \nFRANKLIN ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act? \nALLENBY I have no idea... \nFRANKLIN Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions. \nALLENBY Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden? \nFRANKLIN Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it. \nALLENBY I see. (leans close to Franklin) Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word. \nFRANKLIN Of course, Doctor, I understand. \nALLENBY Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin. \nFRANKLIN Certainly, glad to be of help. \nAllenby rises, leaves the bar. \nINT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - DINNER PARTY - NIGHT \nEve and Sophie are talking to a small group. Chance moves away to get an hors d'oeuvre and is approached by RONALD STIEGLER, a publisher. \nSTIEGLER Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books. \nCHANCE (a two-handed handshake) Hello, Ronald. \nSTIEGLER Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say? \nCHANCE I can't write. \nSTIEGLER (smiles) Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers... \nCHANCE I can't read. \nSTIEGLER Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television... \nCHANCE Yes. I like to watch. \nSTIEGLER Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days... \nCHANCE (mild interest) What sort of bed is it? \nINT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nRand is in bed. Sitting nearby are two attorneys, MONROE and TOWNSEND. Mrs. Aubrey stands to one side and Constance and Teresa prepare an IV for Rand. \n", "test2_id": 2953, "test3_input": "RAND (speaks slowly, with effort) Everything. I said everything and that's exactly what I mean. \nMONROE But, Mr. Rand, the holdings are so extensive, I would like to be more precise in... \nRAND (interrupts) What could be more precise than everything...? \nAllenby enters the room, stands by the door, unnoticed. \nMONROE (turns to Townsend) Everything to Mrs. Rand. \nTOWNSEND (drafting a will) Right - everything. \nRAND You two don't have to lecture me on the complexities of the situation, no one knows that better than myself... But you must understand that I have an endless faith in Mrs. Rand's abilities - I know that she will select the right person for guidance when she has the need... She has shared my life, gentlemen, she has given me far more pleasure than any of my so called assets... Life has suddenly become very simple for me now - I may be older than my years, and you might think me to be somewhat feeble... But I am still in love, gentlemen, thank God for that... \nAllenby silently leaves the room. \nINT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - DINNER PARTY - NIGHT \nDennis Watson, of the State Department, talks with Chance in a corner of the living room. Dennis whispers something into Chance's ear and Chance gives him an innocent smile. Dennis is encouraged by the smile. \nDENNIS We could do it now, we can go upstairs. (no reaction from Chance) ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs. \nCHANCE (blankly) I like to watch. \nDENNIS Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone? \nCHANCE Yes. I like to watch very much. \nDENNIS Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too. (takes Chance's arm) We can go this way. \nCHANCE I want to tell Eve. \nDENNIS Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand? \nCHANCE Yes. \nDENNIS (pulling Chance) Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd. \nDennis leads Chance out of the crowded room. \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA light from the adjoining bathroom filters into the darkened bedroom. The President and the First Lady are in bed. They each lie on their backs, a distance apart and are silent. \nFIRST LADY (after some time) ... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling. \nPRESIDENT No, that won't do any good. \nFIRST LADY (another pause) ... Is it me? Is there something I've done? \nPRESIDENT Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you... \nFIRST LADY (another pause) It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator... \nPRESIDENT It's not that, I just... \nThe inter-White House phone rings, the President reaches for it. \nPRESIDENT (CONT'D) (into phone) Yeah, Kaufman - what is it? \nKAUFMAN'S VOICE (over phone) Chief, we have a break in the case. Our man at the Washington Post says they are working on a story that either the CIA or the FBI destroyed Gardiner's files before anyone could get to them. \nPRESIDENT What? Why? \nKAUFMAN'S VOICE (over phone) I can't say at this time - neither agency will admit to a thing. \nPRESIDENT (getting out of bed) Okay, get both Directors over here, I'll be right down. \nThe President hangs up the phone as the First Lady stares at the ceiling. \nINT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT \nA small room exquisitely decorated in pale lilac tapestry. The lights are very dim, and Dennis, who we cannot see, is lying on the floor. Dennis' clothes are draped over a chair. Chance sees a very small pocket television on a desk. He turns the TV on. \nDENNIS' VOICE (softly) Can you see well? \nCHANCE (squints at small screen) Yes, very well, thank you. \n", "test3_true": "CHANCE Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good. \nDENNIS' VOICE (disappointed at it being 'tiny') ... Are you sure you like it? \nCHANCE Yes, I do, it's very good. \nDENNIS' VOICE (excited) Really? Really!!! \nChance reacts to the change in tone of Dennis' voice, turns to look at him on the floor. Hearing the groans and heavy breathing, Chance thinks Dennis is ill. \nCHANCE Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert... \nDENNIS' VOICE I don't want Robert. \nCHANCE I see. \nDENNIS' VOICE (through the groans) Your foot! Give me your foot!! \nDennis reaches out with his free hand, grabs Chance's foot, pulls it to himself. \nCHANCE (some pain) Thank you. But my leg is still a little sore. \nChance watches as Dennis goes through some spasms, then his body relaxes. Chance is concerned for Dennis' health. \nCHANCE (CONT'D) Are you sure you're not ill? \nWe hear a contented sigh from the man on the floor. \nEXT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT \nA long, black limousine with a Red Star on the door pulls away from Sophie's house. \nINT. RED STAR LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nALEXIS NOVOGROD, a high-ranking KGB officer, and two of his underlings are in the limousine, along with Skrapinov, his wife and Karpatov. Novogrod and his men wear heavy clothing, fresh from Moscow. They all drink vodka. \n(Dialogue in Russian, English subtitles) \nNOVOGROD The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files. \nSKRAPINOV That could be possible... \nNOVOGROD But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat. \nSKRAPINOV A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself! \nNOVOGROD That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government. \nSKRAPINOV Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod. \nNOVOGROD You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship. \nSKRAPINOV Thank you, Colonel. \nNOVOGROD (raising his glass) Let us toast to the success of the coup. \nThey all raise their glasses. \nGROUP TOAST Na zdorov'e! \nThe men and Mrs. Skrapinov drink their vodkas. \nINT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe reception is breaking up. Eve, wearing her coat, searches for Chance in the crowd. She sees him, taps him on the shoulder from behind. \nEVE Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman. \nCHANCE No. I was with a man. We went upstairs. \nEVE Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion... \nCHANCE He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while. \nEVE It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort. \nEve and Chance leave the reception. \n", "test3_id": 2954}

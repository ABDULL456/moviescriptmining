The older woman is still just staring, trying not to breathe. The horse flicks her in the face with his tail. 
99   INT. /EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT                                       * 
The rooftop has a spectacular view of the city.  TRACKING WITH   * Malik as he comes out of the elevator, rides to the far edge of  * the roof and slides to a stop.  He looks  down twenty stories. 
THE SECOND ELEVATOR  arrives.  The doors part and Harry comes    * out, with his Glock poised and ready.  He sees Malik revving     * his bike.  The terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one- eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof.  Amazingly, he increases speed, ROARING RIGHT OFF THE EDGE,  ARCING THE BIKE SUICIDALLY OUT INTO SPACE! 
Harry rides to the edge in time to see Malik, on his bike, CLEAR A 60 FOOT JUMP and SPLASH INTO THE ROOFTOP POOL of a       * LOWER BUILDING next to the hotel! 
Harry is out of control now, seeing the guy setting away.  He wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some running space.  Then he turns again, back toward the edge Malik jumped from.  He kicks the horse's flanks and yells HAAHH!! The horse's hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt toward the edge. 
But a horse is not a motorcycle.  It is slightly smarter.  It slams its front hoofs down together, stopping suddenly.  Harry goes right over its head.  He flies forward, almost going right off the roof.  He slams to the edge, with his legs dangling over, holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand.  His Glock tumbles down into darkness. 
Harry sees Malik far below, climb out of the pool, running to the roof door of the other building.  Getting away.  Harry clambers up onto his own roof, breathing hard.  He walks over to the horse. 
HARRY What the hell were you thinking? We had the guy and you let him get away. 
He looks into the horse's innocent brown eyes.  Pats its neck fondly. 
HARRY What kind of  cop are you? 
100   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT 
Helen is asleep at the dining room table next to a half-eaten cake and some melted ice cream.  His unopened presents are piled at one end of the table.  She raises her head as Harry enters sheepishly. 
HARRY Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick-- 
HELEN It's okay, don't bother, Harry. 
He goes to her and puts his arms around her.  He is tender with her.  He wishes he can tell her the truth. 
HARRY I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party. 
HELEN Yeah.  It was great. 
Helen finds a smile for him somewhere.  She really does love him, though more and more often lately she finds her heart in pain. 
HELEN Let's go to bed, Harry.  There's only one present you have to open tonight. 
She grins and arches one eyebrow meaningfully. 
101   INT. BEDROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Helen walks Harry to the edge of the bed and sits him down. She puts her hand on his chest and pushes, causing him to lie back. 
HELEN Don't move.  I'll be right back. 
She turns on the stereo.  A Kenny G disc she put in there earlier.  Soft tenor sax flows around the room.  Helen enters the BATHROOM and shuts the door partway.  She opens a cupboard and quickly pulls out some things she hid there earlier.  A bottle of champagne on ice.  Two glasses.  Some trashy lingerie. 
HARRY Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth. 
HELEN I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office? 
HARRY I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it-- 
Helen is hurrying to put on the unfamiliar lingerie.  G-string panties and low-cut bra.  She holds up the garter belt, turning it backward and forward, trying to figure out which way it goes. 
ON HARRY, yawning.  Lying with the ease of years of practice. 
HARRY It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown-- 
HELEN (keeping him talking) What'd you do, honey? 
HARRY Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server... 
Helen is pulling up the black stockings.  She fastens the garters to the tops.  Her features are a scowl of concentration.  She is very earnest in her preparations. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild. 
HELEN (putting on black pumps) It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system. 
HARRY (faintly) Uh huh. 
HELEN My husband the hero. 
Red lipstick.  Then she puts a little perfume on her wrists. 
HELEN I'll be right there, honey.  Just a minute. 
Harry doesn't answer.  Helen puts a little perfume down the front of her panties. 
HELEN Just a second. 
Helen quickly pours two glasses of champagne.  Then she slinks around the doorframe, making her entrance.  She looks like a living 900 number.  Helen stands before the bed, looking down, holding the champagne glasses. 
ON HARRY: sprawled on the bed, fully clothed, snoring softly. A little bit of drool is coming out the side of his mouth. 
HOLD ON HELEN, all dressed up with no place to go.  She gazes down at him, her shoulders slumping. 
HELEN Happy Birthday, Harry. 
She sighs deeply and downs her champagne in one long gulp.

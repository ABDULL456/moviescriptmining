DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT HILDY 
at typewriter, smoke rising from her cigarette. As the CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS we see a fairly disheveled Hildy typing away furiously. 
BURNS' VOICE (Into phone) "The Blackest cesspool in American city life!" Hold on Duffy, I'll see if she's got any more. 
Burns comes into the scene, tears a page out of Hildy's typewriter. She inserts another one without noticing. 
MED. SHOT 
Burns goes back to the phone as Hildy continues to type furiously. 
BURNS (into phone) Duffy -- Duffy! (clicking the phone furiously) Operator! Operator! Get me Duffy back. Somebody cut us off! 
ANOTHER ANGLE FAVORING DOOR 
as Bruce Baldwin enters. 
BRUCE Hildy! 
BURNS What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy! (suddenly, into phone) Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that? 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY 
typing away madly. Bruce comes into the scene. 
BRUCE Hildy! 
HILDY (looking up, very casually) Hello, Bruce... 
She resumes her typing, then suddenly realizes the situation and jumps up. 
HILDY BRUCE!! How'd you get out? 
BRUCE (the hands-off attitude) Not through any help of yours, Hildy. 
HILDY Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam -- 
BURNS' VOICE Hildy! 
MED. SHOT 
As Hildy turns toward his voice, Burns, still with the phone in his hand, keeps talking to her. 
BURNS For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story! 
HILDY (resignedly) Okay, Walter. (sits down at her typewriter again) 
CLOSE TWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY 
Hildy begins typing again. 
BRUCE I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail... (desperately) I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station! 
HILDY (she barely stops typing) We'll explain the whole thing to them. (resumes typing) 
BRUCE I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours. 
HILDY Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that. (calling o.s. to Walter) Walter! 
CLOSE SHOT BURNS 
BURNS (into phone) Take the President's speech and run it on the funny page... (turns to Hildy, o.s.) What is it, Hildy? 
HILDY'S VOICE What was the name of the Mayor's first wife? 
BURNS You mean the one who drank so much? Tillie! 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND BRUCE 
HILDY Thanks. (she types furiously) 
CLOSE SHOT THE DESK 
Its top opens slowly and Williams' head sticks out. 
CLOSEUP BURNS INCLUDING DESK IN B.G 
BURNS (screaming) Get back in there, you mock turtle! 
The desk-top falls, the fugitive disappearing within. 
CLOSEUP BRUCE 
turning around toward Burns. 
BRUCE Did you say anything, Mister Burns? 
CLOSEUP BURNS 
covering up, fast. 
BURNS No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. (indicating phone in his hand) 
MED. CLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY 
BRUCE (to Burns) Oh. (turns to Hildy) I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you. 
HILDY Oh, she was here. 
BRUCE Where'd she go? 
HILDY Out some place. 
She types away. Bruce grabs her and stops her. 
BRUCE Hildy! Where's mother? 
HILDY Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went. 
BRUCE Did you give her the money? 
HILDY No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly. 
BRUCE Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars. 
HILDY Oh, yes. Here it is. 
She gets the wallet. Burns comes into the scene and pulls another page out of her machine. 
HILDY Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars. 
BRUCE (drily) Thank you.

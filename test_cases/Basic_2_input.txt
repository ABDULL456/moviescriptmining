KENDALL (V.O.) It was the regular Tuesday night drill. He'd let us sleep for an hour and then wake us up, drag us out to the bayou, and work us all night, separate from the others. The door SLAMS OPEN, revealing West. 
WEST Get up, get up, get up! We're going on a little night hike, boys - muster in five on the south tarmac! 
He leaves as the Sectioners rise, groaning. 
PIKE Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out? 
MUELLER Toughens us up, Pike.    You don't like it, quit. 
Pike pulls on his pants and shoots him the finger. 
KENDALL Maybe we shouldn't go.

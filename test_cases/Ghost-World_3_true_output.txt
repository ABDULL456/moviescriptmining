ROBERTA These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this. 
ENID Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture... 
ROBERTA Did you actually do this painting? 
ENID Well, no - it's more like a "found art object." 
ROBERTA And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism? 
ENID It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something... 
ROBERTA And how does an image like this help us to see that? 
ENID I'm not sure... I mean... (thinks) I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking? 
A long pause as Roberta and the class stare at the painting. 
ROBERTA I don't really know what to say, Enid... (another over-long pause) ...It's a remarkable achievement. 
INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING 
Enid is lying on her back with her head on Rebecca's stomach. 
Both stare blankly at the ceiling. 
REBECCA Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job... 
ENID (trying to generate some enthusiasm) Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated... 
REBECCA When are you finally going to get your diploma? 
ENID I dunno, but next week is my last class... 
REBECCA Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment... (waits for some response from Enid, but there is none) Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment? 
ENID Wasn't it like eighth grade? 
REBECCA Seventh... you wanted to move out right then! 
ENID That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine... 
REBECCA I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him. 
ENID We were such desperate sluts back then. 
INT. PACIFIC THEATER - AFTERNOON 
Enid is behind the candy counter dressed in a brown and orange uniform. 
MANAGER I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds. 
ENID You can count on me, sir! 
A customer, an ALCOHOLIC LOSER, approaches the candy counter. 
LOSER Do you serve beer or any alcohol? 
ENID I wish!... actually you wish... after about five minutes of this movie you'll wish to God you had about ten beers! 
LOSER stares blankly, hesitates, then goes into theater. 
MANAGER (pulling her aside) What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature! 
ENID Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money... 
MANAGER Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater... 
ENID But I was only trying to be friendly... 
MANAGER Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job. 
ENID Okay, okay... I won't say a word... 
ANOTHER ANGLE - an hour has gone by. 
CUSTOMER Medium popcorn. 
ENID That's three dollars. 
CUSTOMER Let me have plenty of butter on that. 
ENID Ewww!... (making a face) Here you go -- smothered in delicious yellow-chemical sludge! 
MANAGER (pulling her aside) What the hell is wrong with you?!

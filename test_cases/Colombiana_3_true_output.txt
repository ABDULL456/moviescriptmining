They shoot the liquor down. Fabio rises. 
DON LUIS So. Business is all clear? 
FABIO All clear. 
He hands Don Luis a computer disc. 
FABIO It's all here. 
DON LUIS No other copies? 
FABIO You even have to ask? 
DON LUIS Hey. 
He shrugs. Opens his arms. The two men embrace. Close as brothers. 
FABIO Adios Marco. Make sure he doesn't get in too much trouble. 
MARCO Adios Don Fabio. I'll do my best. 
And with that, Fabio exits the garden. Don Luis watches him, sad to see his friend go. Sighs deeply, pours himself a whiskey, downs it, turns to Marco. 
DON LUIS Kill this motherfucker. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Two men, holding automatics in their laps sit in the back, the driver in the front. They see Fabio very contained, calm, walking towards them. The driver turns the engine on. Fabio slips into the passenger seat. The car takes off. 
Fabio explodes. Smashes the dashboard. Over and over. 
FABIO This fucker! The motherfucker! 
He keeps banging the dash. 
DRIVER Not OK Boss? 
FABIO This bastard thinks I'm an idiot. Playing it all mellow and shit. If he would have yelled and screamed and threatened to kill my whole family, it would have been OK. We have an hour to get out of here. At most. 
Off the nervous looks of the guys in the car... 
EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY 
Fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. Fabio exits to three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. The gunmen from the car take defensive positions. Fabio runs up the stairs. 
INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY 
Cat is still at the table drawing, when she hears the screeching of tires, the fast footsteps outside. She senses a storm coming. Fabio bursts in. His wife sees his tension filled face. 
MOTHER Fabio? 
FABIO We've got ten minutes. 
MOTHER (PANICKED) Cataleya, go pack! 
CAT I'm packed Mama. 
Cat is strangely calm, just sits at the table. Watches as Fabio takes the family picture off the wall, pries the frame back, extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame, comes over to Cat. 
FABIO Listen to me my darling. Just in case of anything. This... 
He holds the chip up. 
FABIO This is your passport. Do you understand? 
She nods. He places the chip in her hand, takes a card out of his pocket. 
FABIO You find yourself alone? You go to the address on this card. Show it to the man at the front gate. 
CAT I don't understand papa. 
FABIO You don't have to understand. You just have to listen, and remember. 
As Cat looks at the chip. 
EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY 
As Fabio's men keep a sharp lookout, two SUV's come rolling down the street. Their fingers work the triggers of their weapons. The two SUV's roll up. The blacked out windows roll down. 
MAN (polite. smiling) Hola. We want to see Don Fabio. 
BODYGUARD He's not home. 
MAN You mind if we wait? 
BODYGUARD Your time. 
INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY 
Fabio writes on top of Cat's drawing, rips the page off, folds it, puts it in her pocket, removes a medal from around his neck, drapes it over hers. 
FABIO And this will keep you safe. 
Cat looks down at the medal. 
CLOSE ON THE MEDAL 
An imprint of a flower. 
FABIO The Cataleya orchid. It comes from one place on Earth. Our place. My mother, your grandmother, used to grow them. Every morning I would wake up to the sight of them. The smell of them. That's why I named you after them. It reminds us of who we are. 
He kisses her on the forehead. His wife appears at the doorway with two suitcases. 
MOTHER I'm ready.

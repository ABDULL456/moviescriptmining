SCOTT SMITH Are you on uppers or what? 
HARVEY MILK No. This is just... plain old me. 
SCOTT SMITH You're afraid of the cops? 
HARVEY MILK I'm just discreet. I know a lot of people here. If they found out, I could lose my job. 
SCOTT SMITH (meaning a closet case) Oh. You're one of "those." (examines Harvey's eyes) I think you need a change of scenery. New friends. 
HARVEY MILK I need a change. 
SCOTT SMITH (looks at the clock) You're forty now. 
HARVEY MILK (just the truth) Forty years old and I haven't done a thing I'm proud of. 
SCOTT SMITH (re: the desert tray) You keep eating like this and you'll be a fat ass by fifty. 
HARVEY MILK (laughs it off) No. Don't you worry. I won't make it to fifty. Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding, he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face. Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) (an idea, half-jokingly, 
HALF-SERIOUSLY) Why don't we run away together? 
SCOTT SMITH Where to? 
16 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT 
RETURN TO: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder. (Throughout the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is telling us things no one else knows.) 
HARVEY MILK In those days, San Francisco was the place where everyone wanted to go... To drop out... To fall in love... 
16A INT. DODGE CHARGER - MONTAGE - (1972) 
8MM HOME MOVIE MONTAGE of Harvey and Scott DRESSED FULL-OUT LIKE HIPPIES, long hair, beard, beads, sunglasses, driving 
through the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into San Francisco. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) But by 1972, The Haight was boarded up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The new place for us refugees was this run down Irish Catholic neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six blocks square... The Castro. 
17 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY 
Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of Castro Street. 
WE SEE WHAT HARVEY SEES THROUGH THE LENS: A HARDWARE STORE, a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows... Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro Theater, big letters spelling out... "C A S T R O..." Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray- haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his face, an expression of distrust. Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads: 
"EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY." Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling. Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT SIGN hanging out front. 
19 INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY 
The place is FILLED with OPERA MUSIC from a record player. Harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera. Scott is getting high, lying in the sun that pours through the large, empty windows. 
SCOTT SMITH I cashed my last unemployment check yesterday... 
HARVEY MILK Well, I hope you did something useful with it. 
SCOTT SMITH I bought an ounce of pot. I was just wondering if you had any

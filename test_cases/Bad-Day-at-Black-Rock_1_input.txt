He drives his right fist against Smith's chin. Smith's head snaps back as far as it can go and then wobbles to rest on his chest. He collapses. Macreedy blows out his breath hard. He staggers to Liz. As he bends over her...

EXT. BLACK ROCK - DAY (DAWN) 
Liz's jeep, driven by Macreedy, rolls slowly down the empty main street of the sleeping town. Behind him, under a tarp, the body of the girl lies lifeless across the seat. On the seat beside him is Smith's rifle, the balance a few inches from Macreedy's elbow. On the right front fender of the jeep Smith sits precariously, his shirt scorched and ragged. He wears a sullen expression of pained indifference. 
In b.g., as the jeep passes, isolated lights go on, first in Doc's house, then in two or three others. Macreedy is oblivious to them. 
EXT. JAIL - CLOSE SHOT - A MAN 
almost completely hidden, looks out grimly from a corner of the jail window. Protruding through the bars, swiveling to follow the progress of the jeep down the street, is the long, ugly muzzle of a rifle. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - JEEP 
as Macreedy pulls up to the curb in front of the jail and cuts the ignition. He grabs the rifle, and steps around to Smith. 
MACREEDY (tonelessly, prodding Smith off the fender with his rifle) Hands behind your head. 
Smith complies. 
EXT. JAIL 
as Macreedy marches Smith up the steps. The jail door opens. A man emerges, wearing a Mackinaw over his vest and carrying a rifle. It is Tim. For a moment Macreedy eyes him in silence. His gun finger tightens on the rifle in his hand. Tim's rifle, too, is at the ready... 
MACREEDY (after a beat) Am I going to have trouble with you? 
TIM Nope. But I sure thought the situation was going to be like reversed. I thought I was going to have trouble... (nodding sharply in Smith's direction) ...with him. I'll take care of him. 
MACREEDY (still hesitating) Just as you took care of his buddies? 
TIM Just as I took care of his buddies. Me, an' Doc, and Pete... 
The SOUND of running feet padding along the dirt road increases on SOUND TRACK. Macreedy turns slightly, to see Doc huffing toward him. The older man climbs the jail steps and comes to an abrupt halt, his eyes going from one to the other of the two men in the stand-off. 
DOC (to Macreedy) It's all right, Macreedy... 
He pulls Tim's Mackinaw to one side, revealing the silver- plated star pinned at the breast. 
DOC Old Tim here's got his badge back. 
Macreedy swings his rifle from Tim to Smith. Tim lowers his, stepping to one side, allowing Smith, covered by Macreedy, to enter the jail. He goes in, Doc following. Pete sits silently at Tim's desk. 
INT. JAIL 
In one of the two cells are Coley and Hector. In the other, Sam and Hastings. 
MACREEDY (looking around) Well. The gang is all here. 
TIM I thought I'd take one last whack at my job. Even if Smith killed me for it. 
MACREEDY (jerking his head toward Smith) Put him in with Hastings. 
Tim turns his key in the cell door. Macreedy tiredly goes to Pete at the desk. 
MACREEDY Your sister's outside, Pete. 
Pete rises. Macreedy halts him momentarily, gripping his arm... 
MACREEDY (flatly) She's dead. 
Pete walks dazedly out the door. Tim grabs Smith's shoulder and propels him roughly through the cell door. He slams it hard. As the clatter of the iron door reverberates harshly...

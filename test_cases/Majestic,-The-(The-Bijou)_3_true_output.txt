Luke smiles at this scene as Harry wipes his eyes and puts his arm around Luke's shoulder, pulls him close and kisses him on the forehead.

THE SAME - LATER 
The Lawson High School Marching Band is set up on the steps of City Hall, playing the "Star Spangled Banner."  They are being conducted by their director, MR. PHILLIPS.  Luke and Harry, hands over their hearts, watch and sing along.  Then, Luke takes a closer look at the DRUM MAJOR... 
ON THE DRUM MAJOR, 
a tall young man wearing an ornate brocaded red and white uniform with "LHS" emblazoned across the chest. 
ON LUKE 
He has an idea.  The anthem ends, and Luke excuses himself and moves forward, buttonholing Mr. Phillips as he comes down the steps... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  BIJOU - DAY 
Luke and Adele are on ladders, hanging letters on the marquee, which reads: 
GRAND RE-OPENING TONIGHT! GENE KELLY AN AMERICAN IN PARIS 
Harry comes outside and gets their attention.  Grandly, he gestures toward the door, and out strides 
OLD TIM, 
wearing his new uniform -- it's the Lawson High School drum major's uniform, modified here and there.  "B-I-J-O-U" is proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters. 
Luke and Adele applaud.  Old Time looks up at them -- AND SMILES! 
INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT 
Old Tim stands at attention, clutching the front door handle. Mrs. Terwilliger, wearing a new dress, her hair newly and perfectly coiffed, stands at the ready at her candy counter, ready to sell tickets and refreshments. 
Harry and Luke nervously pace the lobby.  Luke checks his watch.  It's time.  He shakes Harry's hand, and nods to Old Tim, who swings the door open... 
ON THE DOOR 
Immediately, PATRONS come flooding into the theater.  Luke exchanges surprised glances with Harry -- then walks outside. 
OUTSIDE THE THEATER 
Luke comes out and looks down the block. 
HIS POV 
The line of PATRONS stretches two deep down the block and around the corner. 
Luke smiles.  Success.

THE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- "FRED ASTAIRE - ROYAL WEDDING" 
INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY 
Luke's selling tickets from behind the candy counter while Mrs. Terwilliger sells refreshments to a line of CUSTOMERS. Luke sells a ticket to a WOMAN, who moves away, revealing 
BOB LEFFERT AND MABEL. 
Luke smiles at Bob, who smiles back, his eyes now fairly dancing with life.  He plunks down his admission, and Luke hands him two tickets, which he takes with his hook-hand. Mabel smiles at Luke, takes Bob's good hand, and they move away, revealing A FARMER AND HIS WIFE, 50s. 
The Farmer steps up and holds out a plucked chicken by its neck. 
Luke, surprised, jumps back -- then smiles, pulls off two tickets, and exchanges them for the chicken.

THE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" 
INT.  BEHIND THE SCREEN - NIGHT 
The only light back here is the light of the movie, spilling through the screen.  Luke is straightening up the backstage storage area, when Adele taps him on the shoulder.  He turns, and she throws her arms around his neck and kisses him.  She hands him a paper to read. 
ON THE PAPER 
Luke angles it so he can read it by the light of the screen. It says: 
California State Bar Association ADELE LOUISE LARDNER has PASSED the State Bar examination. 
Luke, thrilled, grabs Adele and picks her up, twirling her around with joy.  He sets her down and kisses her passionately. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" 
INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT 
Harry is frantically threading the changeover projector.  The bell on the running projector DINGS! once, signalling that the reel is coming to an end.  Harry looks out the window at the screen, then back to the task at hand. 
INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT 
Luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster. With a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring how handsome the old place looks.  Old Tim, snappily attired in his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a dustpan.  Mrs. Terwilliger is straightening up the candy counter.  All is well. 
Luke goes to the lobby's poster case.  He opens it, and unfolds a brand-new one-sheet poster for "SAND PIRATES" -- the same design as the one-sheet we saw in Pete's apartment. Methodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the case.

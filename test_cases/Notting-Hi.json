{"train": "N O T T I N G   H I L L \nScreenplay by Richard Curtis \nTitle \nEXT. VARIOUS DAYS \n'She' plays through the credits. \nExquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of glamour and sophistication and mystery. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nMix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.  We follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of bread.  It is spring. \nWILLIAM (V.O.) Of course, I've seen her films and always thought she was, well, fabulous -- but, you know, million miles from the world I live in.  Which is here -- Notting Hill -- not a bad place to be... \nEXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY \nIt's a full fruit market day. \nWILLIAM (V.O.) There's the market on weekdays, selling every fruit and vegetable known to man... \nEXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY \nA man in denims exits the tattoo studio. \nWILLIAM (V.O.) The tattoo parlour -- with a guy outside who got drunk and now can't remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'... \nEXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY \nWILLIAM (V.O.) The racial hair-dressers where everyone comes out looking like the Cookie Monster, whether they like it or not... \nSure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant. \nEXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SATURDAY \nWILLIAM (V.O.) Then suddenly it's the weekend, and from break of day, hundreds of stalls appears out of nowhere, filling Portobello Road right up to Notting Hill Gate... \nA frantic crowded Portobello market. \nWILLIAM (V.O.) ... and thousands of people buy millions of antiques, some genuine... \nThe camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes and saints. \nWILLIAM (V.O.) ... and some not so genuine. \nEXT. GOLBORNE ROAD - DAY \nWILLIAM (V.O.) And what's great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London -- that's Tony, architect turned chef, who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new restaurant... \nShot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant, the sign still being painted.  He receives and approves a huge fresh salmon. \nEXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY \nWILLIAM (V.O.) So this is where I spend my days and years -- in this small village in the middle of a city -- in a house with a blue door that my wife and I bought together... before she left me for a man who looked like Harrison Ford, only even handsomer... \nWe arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello. \nWILLIAM (V.O.) ... and where I now lead a strange half-life with a lodger called... \nINT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY \nWILLIAM Spike! \nThe house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two- bachelor flat. \nSpike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears only shorts. \nSPIKE Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you? \nANNA Really? \nWILLIAM Yes.  This one though is... very good. \nHe picks up a book on the counter. \nWILLIAM I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab. \nANNA Thanks.  I'll think about it. \nWilliam suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor beside him. \nWILLIAM If you could just give me a second. \nHer eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes. \nWILLIAM Excuse me. \nTHIEF Yes. \nWILLIAM Bad news. \nTHIEF What? \nWILLIAM We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop. \nTHIEF So? \nWILLIAM So, I saw you put that book down your trousers. \nTHIEF What book? \nWILLIAM The one down your trousers. \nTHIEF I haven't got a book down my trousers. \nWILLIAM Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,  what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize. \nTHIEF Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers? \nWILLIAM Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec. \nHe returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter. \nWILLIAM Sorry about that... \nANNA No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see. \nWILLIAM Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune. \nShe smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there. \nTHIEF Excuse me. \nANNA Yes. \nTHIEF Can I have your autograph? \nANNA What's your name? \nTHIEF Rufus. \nShe signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it. \nTHIEF What does it say? \nANNA Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.' \nTHIEF Nice one.  Would you like my phone number? \nANNA Tempting but... no, thank you. \nHe jumps back. \nWILLIAM Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up. \nANNA No thank you.  I need to get my car back. \nWILLIAM I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously. \nIn his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him. \nANNA Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards. \nWILLIAM Eighteen yards.  That's my house there. \nHe doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down. She looks up at him. \nINT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY \nThey enter.  She carries a few stylish bags. \nWILLIAM Come on in.  I'll just... \nWilliam runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen. \nWILLIAM It's not that tidy, I fear. \nAnd he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books from her... \nWILLIAM The bathroom is right at the top of the stairs and there's a phone on the desk up there. \nShe heads upstairs. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nWilliam is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He is dazzled by the sight of her. \nWILLIAM Would you like a cup of tea before you go? \nANNA No thanks. \nWILLIAM Coffee? \nANNA No. \nWILLIAM Orange juice -- probably not. \nHe moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents. \nWILLIAM Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest? \nANNA Really, no. \nWILLIAM Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them. \nANNA No. \nWILLIAM Do you always say 'no' to everything? \nPause.  She looks at him deep. \nANNA No. (pause) I better be going.  Thanks for your help. \nWILLIAM You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly. \nIt has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth- talking man. \nWILLIAM Take my one chance to say it.  After you've read that terrible book, you're certainly not going to be coming back to the shop. \nShe smiles.  She's cool. \nANNA Thank you. \nMICHAEL Smile. \nANNA No. \nMICHAEL Smile. \nANNA I've got nothing to smile about. \nMICHAEL Okay in about 7 seconds, I'm going to ask you to marry me. \nAnd after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles. \nINT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nSPIKE Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her. \nWILLIAM Yes, she is fairly fabulous. \nINT. BOOKSHOP - DAY \nThe next day.  William and Martin quietly co-existing.  An annoy- ing customer enters.  Mr. Smith. \nMR. SMITH Do you have any books by Dickens? \nWILLIAM No, we're a travel bookshop.  We only sell travel books. \nMR. SMITH Oh right.  How about that new John Grisham thriller? \nWILLIAM No, that's a novel too. \nMR. SMITH Oh right.  Have you got a copy of 'Winnie the Pooh'? \nPause. \nWILLIAM Martin -- your customer. \nMARTIN Can I help you? \nWilliam looks up.  At that moment the entire window is suddenly taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film, 'Helix.' \nINT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CONDOR/LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWilliam heads upstairs and pauses.  Spike coming down, wearing full body scuba diving gear. \nSPIKE Hey. \nWILLIAM Hi... \nINT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY \nThe two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen. \nWILLIAM Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that? \nSPIKE Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes... \nWILLIAM There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes. \nSPIKE Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey. \nEXT. WILLIAM'S TERRACE - DAY \nThe two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day. William is reading 'The bookseller.'  The terrace is small and the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather wonderful way.  Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on. \nSPIKE There's something wrong with the goggles though... \nWILLIAM No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly. \nSPIKE Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff. \nWILLIAM So -- any messages? \nANNA (V.O.) Hi. \nWe hear her voice -- don't see her. \nWILLIAM (caught out) Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop. \nANNA (V.O.) You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call. \nWILLIAM No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message. \nANNA (V.O.) Oh -- Okay. \nWILLIAM Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something? \nANNA (V.O.) Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good. \nWILLIAM Right.  Great. (he hangs up) Classic.  Classic. \nEXT. RITZ - DAY \nWilliam jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz.  He carries a small bunch of roses. \nINT. RITZ HOTEL - DAY \nHe approaches the lifts.  At the lift, he pushes the button and the doors open.  As he is getting in, William is joined by a young man.  His name is Tarquin. \nWILLIAM Which floor? \nTARQUIN Three. \nWilliam pushes the button.  They wait for the doors to close. \nINT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY \nThe lift lands.  William gets out.  So does Tarquin.  Rooms 30-35 are to the left.  35-39 to the right.  William heads right. So does Tarquin. \nWilliam is puzzled.  He slows down as he approaches room 38.  So does Tarquin.  William spots, so does Tarquin.  William points at the number. \nWILLIAM Are you sure you...? \nTARQUIN Yes. \nWILLIAM Oh.  Right. \nHe knocks.  A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door. \nKAREN Hello, I'm Karen.  Sorry -- things are running a bit late.  Here's the thing... \nShe hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits, with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix.' \nINT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE ANTE-ROOM - DAY \nA few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room.  There are a number of journalists waiting for their audience. \nKAREN What did you think of the film? \nTARQUIN Marvellous.  'Close Encounters' meets 'Jean De Florette.'  Oscar- winning stuff. \nThey both turn to William for his opinion. \nWILLIAM I agree. \nKAREN I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from. \nTARQUIN 'Time Out.' \nKAREN Great.  And you... \nWILLIAM (seeing it on a coffee table) 'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me. \nKAREN Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check. \nWILLIAM I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do. \nANNA No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it. \nWILLIAM Absolutely fine about it. \nRe-enter Jeremy. \nJEREMY Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to talk about her next project, which is shooting later in the summer. \nWILLIAM Oh yes -- excellent.  Ahm -- any horses in that one?  Or hounds, of course.  Our readers are equally intrigued by both species. ANNA It takes place on a submarine. \nWILLIAM Yes.  Right... But if there were horses, would you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing? \nJeremy exits. \nWILLIAM I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you. \nANNA And what happens next in the dream? \nIt's a challenge. \nWILLIAM Well, I suppose in the dream dream scenario.  I just... ahm, change my personality, because you can do that in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the girl but you know it'll never happen. \nPause.  Then they move towards each other when... Jeremy enters. \nJEREMY Time's up, I'm afraid.  Sorry it was so short.  Did you get what you wanted? \nWILLIAM Very nearly. \nJEREMY Maybe time for one last question? \nWILLIAM Right. \nJeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds. \nWILLIAM Are you busy tonight? \nANNA Yes. \nThey look at each other.  Jeremy enters, with another journalists in tow.  Anna and William stand and shake hands formally. \nANNA Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice. \nWILLIAM Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied. \nINT. TRAFALGAR SUITE CORRIDOR - DAY \nWilliam exits fairly despondent and heads for the door.  Tarquin is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone. \nTARQUIN How was she? \nWILLIAM Fabulous. \nTARQUIN Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers? \nWilliam can't think his way out of this. \nWILLIAM Yes.  That's right.  Bitch. \nHe turns to go, but is accosted by Karen. \nKAREN If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others. \nWILLIAM The others? \nINT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY \nKAREN Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.' \nA forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes William's hand. \nANNA Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist. \nWILLIAM Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner. \nANNA Okay -- fine. \nWILLIAM But no, I'm sure I can get out of it. \nANNA No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date. \nWILLIAM You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party? \nANNA If that's all right. \nWILLIAM I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something. \nANNA Okay. \nWILLIAM Okay. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBella and Max are in the kitchen. \nMAX He's bringing a girl? \nBELLA Miracles do happen. \nMAX Does the girl have a name? \nBELLA He wouldn't say. \nMAX Christ, what is going on in there? \nThe oven seems to be smoking a little.  Then the bell rings. \nMAX (cont'd) Oh God. \nIt's bad timing.  Max shoots out of the kitchen. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nMax heads for the door impatiently.  He opens it and turns back without looking at William and Anna standing there. \nMAX Come on in.  Vague food crisis. \nWilliam and Anna move along the corridor to the kitchen. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBella is there. \nBELLA Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected. \nWILLIAM He's cooking guinea fowl? \nBELLA Don't even ask. \nANNA Hi. \nBELLA Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of... \nWILLIAM Bella -- this is Anna. \nBELLA Right. (pause) \nMAX Okay.  Crisis over. \nHe rises from his stove position. \nWILLIAM Max.  This is Anna. \nMAX 'No comment' means 'yes.' \nWILLIAM No, it doesn't. \nMAX Do you ever masturbate? \nWILLIAM Definitely no comment. \nMAX You see -- it means 'yes.' \nThen on to Bernie's conversation. \nBERNIE So tell me Anna -- what do you do? \nANNA I'm an actress. \nBERNIE Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they? \nANNA Well, they can be. \nBERNIE I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do? \nANNA Films mainly. \nBERNIE Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid? \nANNA Fifteen million dollars. \nBERNIE Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts? \nMAX Right -- I think we're ready. \nThey all move towards the kitchen. \nANNA (to Bella) I wonder if you could tell me where the...? \nBELLA Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right. \nHONEY I'll show you. \nA moment's silence as they leave -- then in a split second the others all turn to William. \nBELLA Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott? \nBERNIE Anna Scott? \nBELLA Yes. \nBERNIE The movie star? \nBELLA Yup. \nBERNIE Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God. \nThe horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds. Honey re-enters. \nHONEY I don't believe it.  I walked into the loo with her.  I was still talking when she started unbuttoning her jeans... She had to ask me to leave. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT \nA little later.  They are sat at dinner.  Bella next to Anna. \nBELLA What do you think of the guinea fowl? \nANNA (whispering) I'm a vegetarian. \nBELLA Oh God. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT \nMoving on through the evening -- they are very relaxed, as they eat dinner.  A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing. And there's a cake.  Honey wears Bernie's unsuitable hat.  Anna watches William laughing at something and then putting his head in his hands with mock shame. \nShe leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first time -- she kisses him.  This time a proper kiss.  A tiny pause. \nWILLIAM Nice garden. \nEXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHT \nThey walk around the garden.  It's a moonlit dream.  We see the lights of the houses that surround the garden.  They come across a single, simple wooden bench. \nANNA 'For June, who loved this garden -- from Joseph who always sat beside her.' \nWe cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  She doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917 - 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it. \nANNA Some people do spend their whole lives together. \nHe nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench, looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, up into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Music plays. \nINT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nWilliam in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower. He shoots past Spike. \nWILLIAM Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses? \nSPIKE No, 'fraid not. \nWILLIAM Bollocks. (still searching -- with no help from Spike) This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties. \nSPIKE That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer? \nWILLIAM Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go. \nINT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING \nHe sprints downstairs, now fully dressed. \nWILLIAM (not meaning it) Thanks for your help on the glasses thing. \nSPIKE (sincerely) You're welcome.  Did you find them? \nWILLIAM Sort of. \nINT. CINEMA - NIGHT \nMid-film.  We move across the audience.  And there is in the middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba- diving goggles. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA very smart Japanese restaurant.  We see Anna and William sitting, near the end of their meal. \nANNA So who left who? \nWILLIAM She left me. \nANNA Why? \nWILLIAM She saw through me. \nANNA Uh-oh.  That's not good. \nWe've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table -- now we can hear it.  Two slightly rowdy men. \nLAWRENCE No - No- No!  Give me Anna Scott any day. \nWilliam and Anna look at each other. \nGERALD I didn't like that last film of hers. Fast asleep from the moment the lights went down. \nAgain -- Anna reacts. \nLAWRENCE Don't really care what the films are like.  Any film with her in it -- fine by me. \nGERALD No -- not my type at all really.  I prefer that other one -- blonde -- sweet looking -- has an orgasm every time you take her out for a cup of coffee. \nThey have arrived at the end of the arcade. \nANNA Here we are. (pause) Do you want to come up? \nWILLIAM (he hoes) There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't. \nANNA There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up? \nHis look says yes. \nANNA Give me five minutes. \nHe watches her go -- and stands in the street.  Music plays. \nINT. RITZ CORRIDOR/ANNA'S SUITE - NIGHT \nWilliam coming along the hotel corridor.  He knocks on the door. \nANNA Hiya. \nThere's something slightly awry.  He doesn't notice. \nWILLIAM Hi. \nHe kisses her gently on the cheek. \nWILLIAM To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing. \nANNA (pause) You've got to go. \nWILLIAM Why? \nANNA Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room. \nWILLIAM Your boyfriend? \nHe is duly shocked.  She's trying to be calm. \nANNA Yes... \nJEFF (V.O.) Who is it? \nJeff drifts into view behind.  He is a very famous film star and looks the part -- well built, very handsome.  Unshaven, he has magic charm, whatever he says.  Over a t-shirt, he wears a shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks. \nWILLIAM Ahm... room service. \nJEFF How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats. \nWILLIAM Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call. \nJEFF Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here? \nWILLIAM I'll see what I can do. \nJEFF Still, not sparkling. \nWILLIAM Absolutely.  Ice cold still water. \nJEFF Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims... \nWILLIAM No, I'm sure it'll be fine. \nJEFF And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash. \nWILLIAM Right. \nAnd he does just that.  Scoops up the two used plates and heads to the bin. \nANNA Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job. \nJEFF I'm sorry.  Is this a problem? \nHe roars with laughter.  William smiles. \nWILLIAM Thanks.  Yes -- very helpful. \nINT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nOnly two tables are being used.  William and his friends are on their first course.  Bernie reads an \"Evening Standard,\" with a picture of Anna and Jeff at Heathrow Airport. \nMAX You didn't know she had a boyfriend? \nWILLIAM No -- did you? \nTheir looks make it obvious that everyone did. \nWILLIAM Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine. \nMAX Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods. \nWILLIAM Buggered? \nMAX Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems. \nWILLIAM Really? \nThey all look to him for wise words. \nMAX Her name is Tessa and she works in the contracts department.  The hair, I admit, is unfashionable frizzy -- but she's as bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row.  Apparently. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe kitchen.  William is looking uneasy.  A doorbell rings. \nMAX Now -- try. \nWilliam nods.  Max heads off to the door.  We stay with William -- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the corridor. \nTESSA (V.O.) I got completely lost -- it's real difficult, isn't it?  Everything's got the word 'Kensington' in it -- Kensington Park Road, Kensington Gardens, Kensington bloody Park Gardens... \nThey reach the kitchen.  Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair. \nMAX Tessa -- this is Bella my wife. \nTESSA Oh hello, you're in a wheelchair. \nBELLA That's right. \nMAX And this is William. \nTESSA Hello William.  Max has told me everything about you. \nWILLIAM (frightened) Has he? \nMAX Wine? \nTESSA Oh yes please.  Come on, Willie, let's get sloshed. \nShe turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send a message of panic to Bella.  She agrees -- it's bad. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/CONSERVATORY - NIGHT \nMax walks over to the table.  Honey, Bella, William and another girl. \nMAX Keziah -- some woodcock? \nKEZIAH No, thank you  -- I'm a fruitarian. \nMAX I don't realize that. \nIt is left to William, who has been set up here, to fill the pause. \nWILLIAM And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly? \nMix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide open -- thinking. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMorning.  Max, all in his suit for the city... Bella kisses him goodbye.  William sees this from the kitchen.  She is also dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her briefcase with law books from the kitchen table. \nEXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY \nWilliam emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night away from home, a heads off. \nEXT. NEWSAGENT - DAY \nWilliam walks past the newsagent, heading for home.  We see, though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front page.  Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!' and 'Scott of Pantartica.' \nINT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY \nWilliam is shaving.  The bell goes.  He heads out to answer it. \nEXT./INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -DAY \nWilliam arrives at the door and opens it.  There stands a dark- glassed Anna. \nANNA Hi.  Can I come in? \nWILLIAM Come in. \nShe moves inside.  Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired. Nothing idealized. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe two of them. \nANNA They were taken years ago -- I know it was... well, I was poor and it happens a lot -- that's not an excuse -- but to make things worse, it now appears someone was filming me as well.  So what was a stupid photo- shoot now looks like a porno film. And well... the pictures have been solid and they're everywhere. \nWilliam shakes his head. \nANNA I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded. \nWILLIAM This is the place. \nANNA Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be. \nShe's very shaken. \nANNA These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like... \nWILLIAM Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...? \nANNA A bath would be great. \nINT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY \nSpike enters through the front door.  William doesn't hear him. Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it. \nSPIKE Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic .... magnificent... \nHe heads up the stairs.  Opens the bathroom door, walks in. \nINT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY \nSpike heads for the toilet -- undoes his zip... \nANNA You must be Spike. \nShe's in the bath.  Spike turns in shock -- and sidles out of the bathroom. \nINT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY \nSpike calms himself down.  He then opens the bathroom door again -- and looks in. \nINT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY \nThe darkness of the living room.  We see Anna in the shadow. \nINT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA few moments later.  William and Anna stand in the middle of the room.  He kisses her neck.  Then her shoulder.  What a miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.  Then he looks at her face.  That face.  He is suddenly struck by who it is. \nWILLIAM Wow. \nANNA What? \nAnd then gets over it straight away. \nWILLIAM Nothing. \nAnd kisses her. \nINT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe middle of the night.  They are both asleep -- a yard apart. In sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right next to him.  He is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this all is. \nINT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThe morning. \nWILLIAM It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked. \nANNA You and every person in this country. \nWILLIAM Oh God yes -- I'm sorry. \nANNA What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them? \nWILLIAM Well... \nANNA No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them... \nWILLIAM More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair... \nANNA But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about? \nWILLIAM (pause) Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look... \nHe looks under the sheet at her breasts. \nWILLIAM No, beats me. \nShe laughs... \nANNA Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that? \nWILLIAM Who was Gilda? \nANNA Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me? \nWILLIAM (pause) You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been. \nANNA (very touched) Oh. \nShe looks at him carefully.  Then leaps out of bed. \nANNA I'll be back. \nINT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nWilliam on the bed.  The door opens.  It is Anna with a tray of toast and tea. \nANNA Breakfast in bed.  Or lunch, or brunch. \nShe heads across.  She smiles and sits on the bed. \nANNA Can I stay a bit longer? \nThey toast him. \nHONEY Since it's an evening of announcements ... I've also got one, Ahm... I've decided to get engaged. \nTotal bewilderment from the others. \nHONEY I've found myself a nice, slightly odd looking bloke who I know is going to make me happy for the rest of my life. \nSpecial cut to Bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings for Honey. \nWILLIAM Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this. \nMAX Is it someone we know? \nHONEY Yes.  I will keep you informed. \nAs she sits down, Honey leans towards Spike and whispers. \nHONEY By the way -- it's you. \nSPIKE Me? \nHONEY Yes.  What do you think? \nSPIKE Well, yes.  Groovy. \nMAX Any more announcements? \nWILLIAM Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth. \nMAX There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form. \nWILLIAM But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy. \nINT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nTwo hours later.  They've had a very good time.  There's been a chocolate cake.  Lots of alcohol.  Tony is playing 'Blue Moon' on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing. \nAt one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table. \nBELLA I'm really horribly drunk. \nElsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together. \nMAX So -- you've laid the ghost. \nWILLIAM I believe I have. \nMAX Don't give a damn about the famous girl. \nWILLIAM No, don't think I do. \nMAX Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath. \nHe puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of Anna on its cover. \nWILLIAM (immediate gloom) Oh God no. \nMAX So not over her, in fact. \nEXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY \nCut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath.  William entirely alone.  He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes. \nEXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY \nNow closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where he is himself approached. \nSECURITY Can I help you? \nWILLIAM Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott... \nJAMES No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed. \nANNA I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet. \nBack by the desk, William is listening and laughs.  That's his girl.  Anna prepares. \nANNA So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...? \nJAMES 'Tomorrow will be soon enough.' \nANNA And then I... right. \nJAMES Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up? \nANNA Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation. \nEXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY \nCut back to William -- he has heard. \nWILLIAM Of course. \nHe takes off the headphones and puts them gently down. \nWILLIAM Thank you. \nHARRY Anytime. \nWilliam walks away.  The moment of hope is gone.  He couldn't have had a clear reminder. \nINT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nWilliam is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box. \nSPIKE What's going on? \nWILLIAM I'm going to throw out these old videos. \nSPIKE No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this. \nWILLIAM Right -- let's talk about rent... \nSPIKE Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives. \nINT. BACKROOM OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY \nThe next day.  William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a dark small room with files in it.  Martin pops his head in. \nMARTIN I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery. \nWILLIAM Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself? \nMARTIN But it's not for the shop.  It's for you. \nWILLIAM Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you? \nThey head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing his hands -- he's in a very good mood. \nINT. BOOKSHOP - DAY \nWilliam enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue skirt and top. \nANNA Hi. \nWILLIAM Hello. \nANNA You disappeared. \nWILLIAM Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you. \nANNA Well... how have you been? \nANNA That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict. \nShe's awaiting an answer. \nWILLIAM Anna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level- headed bloke.  Not often in and out of love.  But... \nHe can't really express what he feels. \nWILLIAM ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that? \nANNA ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you. \nWILLIAM The truth is... \nHe feels he must explain. \nWILLIAM ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically. \nANNA I see. (pause) That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it? \nWILLIAM I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name. \nANNA Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision. \nPause. \nANNA The fame thing isn't really real, you know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a girl.  Standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. \nPause.  She kisses him on the cheek. \nANNA Bye. \nThen turns and leaves.  Leaving him. \nINT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nThe restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed.  The pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension lead is on the bare table behind.  They're all sitting there. \nWILLIAM What do you think?  Good move? \nHONEY Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there. \nBELLA Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes. \nWILLIAM Tony -- what do you think? \nTONY Never met her, never want to. \nWILLIAM Brilliant.  Max? \nMAX Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian. \nWILLIAM Great.  Excellent.  Thanks. \nSpike enters. \nSPIKE I was called and I came.  What's up? \nHONEY William has just turned down Anna Scott. \nSPIKE You daft prick! \nBella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside William.  It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which was on his wall. \nBELLA This painting isn't the original, is it? \nWILLIAM Yes, I think that one may be. \nBERNIE But she said she wanted to go out with you? \nWILLIAM Yes -- sort of... \nRITZ MAN No, sir. \nWILLIAM Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead? \nMan shakes his head. \nRITZ MAN No, sir. \nWILLIAM Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks. \nHe turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops him in his tracks. \nRITZ MAN There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126 -- but she checked out an hour ago.  I believe she's holding a press conference at The Savoy before flying to America. \nWilliam is very grateful.  He kisses the Ritz Man.  Bernie's also gratuful.  He kisses him too. \nBERNIE We have lift off!! \nA Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz Man gets kissed a third time. \nEXT. LONDON STREET - DAY \nThe car speeds through London.  It gets totally stuck at a junction where no one will let them in. \nSPIKE Bugger this for a bunch of bananas. \nHe gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the opposite direction.  Our car shoots past him. \nSPIKE Go! \nThey leave him behind.  Honey leans out the window and shouts... \nHONEY You're my hero. \nSpike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly hit by a car. \nEXT. THE SAVOY - DAY \nThey pull to a stop.  William leaps out. \nMAX Go! \nINT. THE SAVOY - DAY \nWilliam rushes up to the main desk. \nWILLIAM Excuse me, where's the press conference? \nMAN AT SAVOY Are you an accredited member of the press? \nWILLIAM Yes... \nHe flashes a card. \nMAN AT SAVOY That's a Blockbuster video membership card, sir. \nWILLIAM That's right... I work for their in- house magazine. (mimes quotation marks) 'Movies are our business.' \nMAN AT SAVOY I'm sorry, sir... \nHoney shoots into shot, pushing Bella's chair. \nBELLA He's with me. \nMAN AT SAVOY And you are? \nBELLA Writing an article about how London hotels treat people in wheelchairs. \nMAN AT SAVOY Of course, madam.  It's in the Lancaster Room.  I'm afraid you're very late. \nHONEY (to William) Run! \n", "test1_input": "WILLIAM Pathetic effort to hog the brownie. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nAnna and William are leaving. \nANNA That was such a great evening. \nMAX I'm delighted. \nHe holds out his hand to shake.  She kisses him on the cheek. He stumbles back with joy. \nANNA And may I say that's a gorgeous tie. \nMAX Now you're lying. \nANNA You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting. \nMax loves this. \nANNA (to Bella) Lovely to meet you. \nBELLA And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian. \nMAX No! \nANNA Night, night, Honey. \nHONEY I'm so sorry about the loo thing. I meant to leave but I just... look, ring me if you need someone to go shopping with.  I know lots of nice, cheap places... not that money necessarily... (gives up) nice to meet you. \nAnd Honey gives her a huge hug. \nANNA You too -- from now on you are my style guru. \nAnna and William head out... Bernie tries to save some dignity. \nBERNIE Love your work. \nThey move to the door and wave goodbye. \nEXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWilliam and Anna step outside.  From inside they hear a massive and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true feelings.  William is a little embarrassed. \nWILLIAM Sorry -- they always do that when I leave the house. \nThe house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill. They walk for a moment.  A bit of silence. \nANNA Floppy, huh? \nWILLIAM It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair. \nANNA Why is she in a wheelchair? \nWILLIAM It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago. \nANNA And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident? \nWILLIAM You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it. \nThey walk in silence for a moment.  Then... \nWILLIAM Would you like to come... my house is just...? \nShe smiles and shakes her head. \nANNA Too complicated. \nWILLIAM That's fine. \nANNA Busy tomorrow? \n", "test1_true": "ANNA I was. \nEXT. NOTTING HILL GARDEN - NIGHT \nA little later in the walk. \nANNA What's in there? \nThey are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage behind it. \nWILLIAM Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages. \nANNA Let's go in. \nWILLIAM Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in. \nANNA You abide by rules like that? \nWILLIAM Ahm... \nHer look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on the answer to this. \nWILLIAM Heck no -- other people do -- but not me -- I just do what I want. \nHe rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite make it, and falls back onto the pavement... \nWILLIAM (casually) Whoopsidaisies. \nANNA What did you say? \nWILLIAM Nothing. \nANNA Yes, you did. \nWILLIAM No, I didn't. \nANNA You said 'whoopsidaisies.' \nTiny pause. \nWILLIAM I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're... \nANNA There's no 'unless.'  No one has said \"whoopsidaisies\" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets. \nWILLIAM Exactly.  Here we go again. \nHe fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously... \nWILLIAM Whoopsidaisies. \nThey look at each other. \nWILLIAM It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long. \nANNA Step aside. \nShe starts to climb. \nWILLIAM Actually be careful Anna -- it's harder than it looks... \nBut she's already almost over. \nWILLIAM Oh no it's not -- it's easy. \nA few seconds later.  Anna jumps down into the garden. \nANNA Come on, Flops. \nWilliam clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself off, and heads towards where she stands. \nWILLIAM Now seriously -- what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile? \n", "test1_id": 348, "test2_input": "WILLIAM Brilliant. (the scene's over) Word perfect I'd say. \nANNA What do you think? \nWILLIAM Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping. \nANNA You think I should do Henry James instead? \nWILLIAM I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too. \nANNA Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.' \nWILLIAM And I think the book is the poorer for it. \nAnna smiles her biggest smile of the day.  He is helping. \nINT. WILLIAM'S DINING ROOM \nAnna and William.  Sat down at table.  There's a picture hanging on the wall behind. \nANNA I can't believe you have that picture on your wall. \nIt is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple, with a goat as company. \nWILLIAM You like Chagall? \nANNA I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky. \nWILLIAM With a goat playing a violin. \nANNA Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat. \nSpike enters with three pizzas. \nSPIKE Voila.  Carnival Calypso, for the Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni, pineapple and a little more pepperoni. \nANNA Fantastic. \nWILLIAM I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I? \nSPIKE (pause) I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect. \nINT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nLater in the evening.  William and Anna on their own.  They're sipping coffee.  A few seconds of just co-existing.  Anna looks up. \nANNA You've got big feet. \nWILLIAM Yes.  Always have had. \nANNA You know what they say about men with big feet? \nWILLIAM No.  What's that? \nANNA Big feet -- large shoes. \nHe laughs. \nINT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub. \nANNA The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses. \nWILLIAM You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity? \nANNA Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.' \nWILLIAM You have a stunt bottom? \nANNA I could have a stunt bottom, yes. \n", "test2_true": "ANNA Definitely.  Ths is important stuff. \nWILLIAM It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom. \nANNA Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious. \nWILLIAM The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom? \nANNA Both. \nINT. WILLIAM'S UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThey are walking up the stairs -- and stop at the top. \nANNA Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected. \nWILLIAM Well, thank you. (awkward pause) Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed. \nANNA Right. \nPause.  She leans forward, kisses him gently, then steps into the bedroom and closes the door. \nINT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWilliam downstairs -- on a sofa -- under a duvet.  Eyes open. Thinking.  Pause and pause. \nHe waits and waits -- the ultimate 'yearn.'  But nothing happens.  William gets off the sofa decisively.  Sits on the side of it.  Then gets back in again. \nPause, pause, then... in the darkness, a stair creaks.  There's someone there. \nWILLIAM (to himself) Oh my God... (then...) Hello. \nSPIKE Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word. \nHe drifts round the corner, half-naked. \nWILLIAM Spike. \nSPIKE I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it? \nWILLIAM Maybe. \nSPIKE And she's in your house. \nWILLIAM Yes. \nSPIKE And you get on very well. \nWILLIAM Yes. \nSPIKE Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one? \nWILLIAM Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip. \nSPIKE Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough. (pause) Do you mind if I have a go? \nWILLIAM Spike! \nSPIKE No -- you're right. \nWILLIAM I'll talk to you in the morning. \nSPIKE Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay. \nBack to William thinking again.  Dreamy atmosphere.  And then... more footsteps on the stairs. \nWILLIAM Oh please sod off. \nANNA Okay. \nWILLIAM No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not. \n", "test2_id": 349, "test3_input": "WILLIAM I don't know what happened. \nANNA I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was. \nShe's packing. \nWILLIAM That's not true. \nANNA Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear. \nSPIKE (dropping in) I went out in my goddamn underwear too. \nWILLIAM Get out, Spike. (he does) I'm so sorry. \nANNA This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend. \nWILLIAM You do? \nIt's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand. \nANNA As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu. \nWILLIAM I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm... \nANNA You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.' \nWILLIAM That's spectacularly unfair. \nANNA Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott. \nShe heads out. \nINT. STAIRS/LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWILLIAM Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea. \nANNA I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home. \nThe doorbell goes. \nWILLIAM Spike, check who that is... and for God's sake put some clothes on. \nSpike leans merrily out of the window. \nSPIKE Looks like a chauffeur to me. \nINT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY \nThey move from the kitchen into the corridor. \nANNA And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal. \nWILLIAM That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter. \nSPIKE What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan. \nWILLIAM Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective. \nANNA You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different. \nWILLIAM I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins. \nANNA Excuse me? \nWILLIAM Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow. \nANNA You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever. \nHe takes this in.  That's the end. \nWILLIAM Right.  Fine.  I will do the opposite, if it's all right by you -- and always be glad you came.  But you're right -- you probably better go. \n", "test3_true": "INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY \nSpike and William sitting there.  Pause. \nWILLIAM Was it you? \nSPIKE I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub. \nWILLIAM Right. \nHe puts his head in his hands.  It's over now. \nEXT. LONDON - DAY \nAs full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through Notting Hill. \nThis walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter, back into spring... \nFirst it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend. \nAs he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat collar -- umbrellas appear.  Followed by winter coats -- chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint of snow. \nThen he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape, for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove. \nBy the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and in a few yards, it is spring again.  He passes Honey again -- arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.  Then turns past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby. The camera holds on her. \nINT. BOOKSHOP - DAY \nA grey day in the bookshop.  Martin and William.  As ever.  A feeling that things in there ever change. \nTen seconds pass.  Honey rushes in.  Spike, still feeling in disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway. \nHONEY Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life. \nWILLIAM Blimey.  What's that? \nHONEY The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her! \nWILLIAM Well, thanks, that's great. \nHONEY It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy. \nAnd she rushes out.  William looks at the piece of paper, folds it and then places it gently in the garbage bin. \nINT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nBella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle.  All the friends are gathered in the restaurant. \nBELLA I have a little speech to make -- I won't stand up because I can't... be bothered. Exactly a year ago today, this man here started the finest restaurant in London. \nTONY Thank you very much. \nBELLA Unfortunately -- no one ever came to eat here. \nTONY A tiny hiccough. \nBELLA And so we must face the fact that from next week, we have to find somewhere near to eat. \nTony's brave face breaks.  The dream is over. \nBELLA I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us... \nBERNIE ... get fired. \nBELLA No! \nBERNIE Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course... (he owns up) I was total crap. \nThey're all rather stunned. \nTONY So we go down together!  A toast to Bernie -- the worst stockbroker in the whole world! \n", "test3_id": 350}

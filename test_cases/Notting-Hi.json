{"test1_input": "They have arrived at the end of the arcade. \nANNA Here we are. (pause) Do you want to come up? \nWILLIAM (he hoes) There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't. \nANNA There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up? \nHis look says yes. \nANNA Give me five minutes. \nHe watches her go -- and stands in the street.  Music plays. \nINT. RITZ CORRIDOR/ANNA'S SUITE - NIGHT \nWilliam coming along the hotel corridor.  He knocks on the door. \nANNA Hiya. \nThere's something slightly awry.  He doesn't notice. \nWILLIAM Hi. \nHe kisses her gently on the cheek. \nWILLIAM To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing. \nANNA (pause) You've got to go. \nWILLIAM Why? \nANNA Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room. \nWILLIAM Your boyfriend? \nHe is duly shocked.  She's trying to be calm. \nANNA Yes... \nJEFF (V.O.) Who is it? \nJeff drifts into view behind.  He is a very famous film star and looks the part -- well built, very handsome.  Unshaven, he has magic charm, whatever he says.  Over a t-shirt, he wears a shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks. \nWILLIAM Ahm... room service. \nJEFF How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats. \nWILLIAM Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call. \nJEFF Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here? \nWILLIAM I'll see what I can do. \nJEFF Still, not sparkling. \nWILLIAM Absolutely.  Ice cold still water. \nJEFF Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims... \nWILLIAM No, I'm sure it'll be fine. \nJEFF And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash. \nWILLIAM Right. \nAnd he does just that.  Scoops up the two used plates and heads to the bin. \nANNA Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job. \nJEFF I'm sorry.  Is this a problem? \n", "test1_true": "JEFF What's your name? \nWILLIAM Ahm... Bernie. \nJeff slips him a fiver. \nJEFF Thank you, Bernie. (to Anna) Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise? \nANNA Nice surprise. \nHe kisses her. \nJEFF Liar. (to William) She hates surprises.  What are you ordering? \nANNA I haven't decided. \nJEFF Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend.\" \nHe wanders off taking off his t-shirt. \nWILLIAM I better leave. \nAnna just nods. \nWILLIAM -- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize... \nANNA I'm sorry... I don't know what to say. \nWILLIAM I think goodbye is traditional. \nINT. RITZ CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nWilliam walks away. \nEXT. RITZ - NIGHT \nWilliam walks down the arcade outside the hotel.  He is stunned. \nEXT. LONDON BUS - NIGHT \nWilliam sits alone on a bus.  We see him through the side window.  As it drives away, we see that the whole back of the bus is taken up with a huge picture of Anna. \nINT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHe gets into his room and sits on the bed. \nINT. SPACESHIP - NIGHT \nSpace Anna, in the very hi-tech environment and a serious moods, fastens the last clasps on her uniform.  She takes a helmet type thing, and places it on her head. \nINT. CONNECT CINEMA - NIGHT \nCut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing. It's not full.  The camera moves and finds, sitting on his own...William.  Just watching.  We see a momentous flash of light from the screen explode, reflected in his eye. \nINT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nWilliam is looking out the window, lost in thought.  Spike enters. \nSPIKE Come on -- open up -- this is me -- Spikey -- I'm in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrations. What's wrong? \nSpike settles on the arm of a chair.  William decides to open up a bit... \nWILLIAM Well, okay.  There's this girl... \nSPIKE Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend. \nWILLIAM She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside. \nSpike nods thoughtfully. \nSPIKE Yeh.  Yeh... tricky... tricky... I knew a girl at school called Pandora ... never got to see her box though. \n", "test1_id": 348, "test2_input": "He roars with laughter.  William smiles. \nWILLIAM Thanks.  Yes -- very helpful. \nINT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nOnly two tables are being used.  William and his friends are on their first course.  Bernie reads an \"Evening Standard,\" with a picture of Anna and Jeff at Heathrow Airport. \nMAX You didn't know she had a boyfriend? \nWILLIAM No -- did you? \nTheir looks make it obvious that everyone did. \nWILLIAM Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine. \nMAX Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods. \nWILLIAM Buggered? \nMAX Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems. \nWILLIAM Really? \nThey all look to him for wise words. \nMAX Her name is Tessa and she works in the contracts department.  The hair, I admit, is unfashionable frizzy -- but she's as bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row.  Apparently. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe kitchen.  William is looking uneasy.  A doorbell rings. \nMAX Now -- try. \nWilliam nods.  Max heads off to the door.  We stay with William -- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the corridor. \nTESSA (V.O.) I got completely lost -- it's real difficult, isn't it?  Everything's got the word 'Kensington' in it -- Kensington Park Road, Kensington Gardens, Kensington bloody Park Gardens... \nThey reach the kitchen.  Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair. \nMAX Tessa -- this is Bella my wife. \nTESSA Oh hello, you're in a wheelchair. \nBELLA That's right. \nMAX And this is William. \nTESSA Hello William.  Max has told me everything about you. \nWILLIAM (frightened) Has he? \nMAX Wine? \nTESSA Oh yes please.  Come on, Willie, let's get sloshed. \nShe turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send a message of panic to Bella.  She agrees -- it's bad. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/CONSERVATORY - NIGHT \nMax walks over to the table.  Honey, Bella, William and another girl. \nMAX Keziah -- some woodcock? \nKEZIAH No, thank you  -- I'm a fruitarian. \nMAX I don't realize that. \nIt is left to William, who has been set up here, to fill the pause. \nWILLIAM And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly? \n", "test2_true": "WILLIAM Right.  Right.  Interesting stuff. (pause) So these carrots... \nKEZIAH Have been murdered, yes. \nWILLIAM Murdered?  Poor carrots.  How beastly. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT \nTime for coffee and chocolates.  Beside William sits the final, perfect girl.  She is Rosie, quite young, smartly dressed, open-hearted.  It is just Max and William and Bella and her. \nROSIE Delicious coffee. \nMAX Thank you.  I'm sorry about the lamb. \nROSIE No -- I thought it was really, you know, interesting. \nWILLIAM Interesting means inedible. \nROSIE Really inedible -- yes that's right. \nThey all laugh.  It's going very well. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nWilliam is with Rosie by the door -- just about to say goodbye. \nROSIE Maybe we'll meet again some time. \nWILLIAM Yes.  That would be... great. \nShe kisses him gently on the cheek.  He opens the door -- she walks out.  He shuts the door quietly and heads back into the living room... \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMax and Bella wait excitedly. \nMAX Well? \nWILLIAM She's perfect, perfect. \nBELLA And? \nWilliam makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then... \nWILLIAM I think you have forgotten... (he looks at them) what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters. \nMAX That's not fair. \nWILLIAM No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend. \nBELLA (pause) Still loves you though. \nWILLIAM In a depressingly asexual way. \nBELLA (pause) I never fancied you much actually... \nThey all roar with laughter. \nBELLA I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears... \nWILLIAM Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch. \nBELLA Do you want to stay? \nWILLIAM Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman. \nMusic starts to play to take us through these silent scenes. \nINT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMax lifts Bella off her couch and carries her upstairs. \n", "test2_id": 349, "test3_input": "ANNA That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict. \nShe's awaiting an answer. \nWILLIAM Anna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level- headed bloke.  Not often in and out of love.  But... \nHe can't really express what he feels. \nWILLIAM ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that? \nANNA ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you. \nWILLIAM The truth is... \nHe feels he must explain. \nWILLIAM ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically. \nANNA I see. (pause) That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it? \nWILLIAM I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name. \nANNA Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision. \nPause. \nANNA The fame thing isn't really real, you know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a girl.  Standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. \nPause.  She kisses him on the cheek. \nANNA Bye. \nThen turns and leaves.  Leaving him. \nINT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nThe restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed.  The pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension lead is on the bare table behind.  They're all sitting there. \nWILLIAM What do you think?  Good move? \nHONEY Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there. \nBELLA Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes. \nWILLIAM Tony -- what do you think? \nTONY Never met her, never want to. \nWILLIAM Brilliant.  Max? \nMAX Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian. \nWILLIAM Great.  Excellent.  Thanks. \nSpike enters. \nSPIKE I was called and I came.  What's up? \nHONEY William has just turned down Anna Scott. \nSPIKE You daft prick! \nBella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside William.  It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which was on his wall. \nBELLA This painting isn't the original, is it? \nWILLIAM Yes, I think that one may be. \nBERNIE But she said she wanted to go out with you? \nWILLIAM Yes -- sort of... \n", "test3_true": "WILLIAM What? \nBERNIE Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it... \nWILLIAM It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. \nThey take in the line.  It totally reverses their attitudes. A pause. \nWILLIAM Oh sod a dog.  I've made the wrong decision, haven't I? \nThey look at him.  Spike does a big nod. \nWILLIAM Max, how fast is your car? \nEXT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nMax's car arrives in the street outside.  They pile into the car. \nMAX If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices. \nBERNIE And we intend to use them! \nMAX Where's Bella? \nHONEY She's not coming. \nMAX Sod that.  Bernie -- in the back! \nHe shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of the chair. \nMAX Come on, babe. \nEXT./INT. CAR. STANLEY CRESCENT/NOTTING HILL GATE - DAY \nMax's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent.  We are inside and outside the car. \nBELLA Where are you going? \nMAX Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner. \nBELLA Crazy.  Go along Bayswater... \nHONEY That's right -- then Park Lane. \nBERNIE Or you could go right down to Cromwell Road, and left. \nWILLIAM No! \nSuddenly the car slams to a halt. \nMAX Stop right there!  I will decide the route.  All right? \nALL All right. \nMAX James Bond never has to put up with this sort of shit. \nEXT. PICCADILLY - DAY \nThe car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz.  William sprints into the hotel.  Bernie follows. \nBERNIE Bloody hell, this is fun. \nIT. RITZ LOBBY - DAY \nWILLIAM Is Miss Scott staying here? \nIt is the same man. \nRITZ MAN No, sir. \nWILLIAM How about Miss Flintstone? \n", "test3_id": 350}

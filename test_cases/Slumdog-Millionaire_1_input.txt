Cuts the call off and slings the phone in a drawer. Takes the gun from his waist, and throws that in too. Slams the drawer shut with as much force as he can. 
150B   INT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                           150B 
JAMAL Salim...! 
The line goes dead. Jamal slides to the floor... 
151    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                            151 
...the camera pulls out from Jamal's face revealing that Jamal is sitting on the floor of Salim's apartment. In the background can be heard the sound of the television. Jamal looks at the knife in his hand, wonders what he might do with it. The sound of Prem's voice on the tv. 
PREM O/S ...if you want a chance to play Who Wants to be a Millionaire, call now...! 
Jamal looks up. Stares at the tv. 
152    INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                            152 
PREM This way, Jamal, this way. Great show, my friend. See you tomorrow, huh? 
In the half-light, Prem guides him to a stage door. 
153    EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                            153 
Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens screaming. 
DIRECTOR What's going on? 
PREM He's a cheat. 
DIRECTOR This was you? You called them? 
Prem shrugs. 
DIRECTOR (CONT'D) How d'you know he's cheating? 
(CONTINUED) 
153   CONTINUED:                                             153 
PREM Oh, come on! Of course he is. He's a bloody village boy. Even when I fed him the wrong answer the little shit got it right. 
Director stares at him. 
DIRECTOR You gave him an answer? 
PREM Well, I didn't exactly- 
The Director walks away shaking his head. In the doorway, Nita is standing there, watching. 
PREM (CONT'D) Nita? 
But she too turns and walks away. 
154   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                            154 
INSPECTOR It is all bizarrely plausible. And yet... 
JAMAL Because I am a slum dog, chi- wallah, I am a liar, right? 
INSPECTOR Most of you are. 
Srinivas comes hurrying in carrying a file, very pleased with himself. 
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS Shooting at Pila Street, October 19th...Maman Hossani....Victim pronounced dead at scene. Suspects absconded: two males, early teens, one female, early teen. 
The Inspector takes the file. Stares at it. Shakes his head. 
INSPECTOR But you: you're not a liar, Mister Malik, that is for sure. You are too truthful. 
He turns to Srinivas. 
(CONTINUED) 
154    CONTINUED:                                                 154 
INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Thank you, Constable. All that remains is to work out whether it was manslaughter or murder. Ten years, or life. 
The Young Constable sticks his head around the door. 
YOUNG CONSTABLE The Commissioner's here, Sir. 
The Inspector sighs. Gets up. Accompanied by Srinivas, he leaves the room. Jamal sits there. Lets his head drop. The camera floats from the room, down the dingy corridor and out through a window... 
155    EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY.                                  155 
....alighting on a crowd of hundreds of people jostling to get a view of the building. News crews are setting up around them. A tv Reporter is doing a piece to camera. 
TV REPORTER ....behind the walls of this police station lies the mystery all of India is talking about. Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated, eighteen year-old boy from the slums of Mumbai win one Crore rupees by fair means or foul? And in the crowds all around me there is an even bigger question. Will he be back on the show tonight to play for twenty million rupees... 
156    OMITTED                                                    156

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE So? Have you charged him yet? 
INSPECTOR I- progress is being made sir.

RAILLY (o.s.) PLEASE, SOMEBODY -- STOP HIM! 
ANGLE ON DETECTIVES, reaching RAILLY and COLE. 
FIRST DETECTIVE (raising his badge) Police Officers.  Would you step over here, please. 
ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something behind the DETECTIVES! 
COLE'S POV:  SCARFACE, dressed like a "businessman"!  He gives COLE a cold look. 
A beat.  COLE lunges at the SECOND DETECTIVE, knocking him off balance, then sprints toward the magnetic arch and through it. 
The ALARM goes off!!!! 
The FIRST SECURITY OFFICER tries to stop COLE, but COLE knocks him aside like a rag doll. 
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, fifty yards up the concourse, glancing back. 
ANGLE ON COLE, pulling his pistol. 
ANGLE ON THE SECOND SECURITY OFFICER. 
FIRST SECURITY OFFICER HE'S GOT A GUN! 
ANGLE ON THE FIRST DETECTIVE, raising his pistol at COLE. 
FIRST DETECTIVE STOP OR I'LL SHOOT! ANGLE ON COLE, gun in hand, sprinting along the concourse toward DR. PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover. 
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, standing at a concourse window, watching a plane land, flanked by his parents whose faces we don't see. 
IT'S SUDDENLY AS IF THE DREAM IS HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE!!!  THE SAME MOKENTS INTERSPERSED WITH "NEW" MOMENTS FROM THE POV OF YOUNG COLE who, hearing the commotion, turns just as DR. PETERS hurries by.  DR. PETERS bumps into YOUNG COLE and reacts by pulling his Bulls bag close to his body and calling... 
DR. PETERS WATCH IT! 
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, wide eyed, watching... 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BLONDE MAN. dashing up the concourse, his moustache slipping over his lip, a pistol in his hand. 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE aims, looking for a clear shot in the crowded passageway. 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BRUNETTE in flashy clothes, gaudy earrings, high heels, and sun glasses SCREAMS... 
BRUNETTE (RAILLY) N0OOOOO0O!!!!!! 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE, firing!  CRACK! 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, shuddering, staggering, falling. 
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, stunned, as his PARENTS try to shield him. 
MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.) My God!  They shot that man! 
Mesmerized, YOUNG COLE watches the BRUNETTE rush to the BLONDE MAN, kneel beside him, minister to his bloody wound. 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, fatalistically reaching up and tenderly touching the BRUNETTE'S cheek, touching her tears. (WE'VE SEEN THIS EXACT IMAGE IN COLE'S DREAM, A POWERFUL MOMENT, UNFOLDING UNNATURALLY SLOWLY, OPENING LIKE A FLOWER.) 
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, not able to hear their words, but he can see emotion as the BLONDE MAN tries to tell the sobbing BRUNETTE something. 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  PARAMEDICS, breaking the spell, pushing the BRUNETTE aside as they crouch beside the BLONDE MAN. 
FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.) Come along, son, this is no place for us. 
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, as his FATHER'S ARM drapes over his shoulder, steering him.  YOUNG COLE turns to look back as he's led away. 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the PARAMEDICS, exchanging glances, shrugging helplessly.  It's too late.  The BLONDE MAN is dead. 
YOUNG COLE sees the BRUNETTE, her face streaked with tears, suddenly turn and look around, scanning the crowd, searching for something.  POLICE OFFICERS approach her, say something to her. Even as she responds, her eyes continue to scan the concourse. 
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, being hurried toward the lobby by his PARENTS (whose faces remain out of view).  He can't help sneaking another look back. 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  POLICE, handcuffing a distracted, unresisting RAILLY.  Even now, she continues to look around almost frantically. 
Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts...she's found what she's looking for! 
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, reacting to the intensity of her look. 
ANGLE ON RAILLY, her eyes speaking to the boy across the crowded concourse. 
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, overwhelmed by the look. 
FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.) Hurry up, son. 
With a last lingering look toward the mysterious BRUNETTE, YOUNG COLE turns away, tears welling in his eyes.  WE MOVE IN...CLOSE... CLOSE...CLOSER...on his eyes.  WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TEAR MEANS, BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS THINKING, BUT WE KNOW VERY WELL WHAT HE WILL REMEMBER! 
MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.) Pretend it was just a bad dream, Jimmy. 
INT.  747 CABIN - DAY 
DR. PETERS closes the door to the overhead luggage rack containing his Chicago Bulls bag and takes his seat.  Next to him, a FELLOW TRAVELER, unseen, says... 
FELLOW TRAVELER'S VOICE (o.s.) It's obscene, all the violence, all the lunacy.  Shootings even at airports now. You might say...we're the next endangered species...human beings! 
CLOSE ON DR. PETERS, smiling affably, turning to his neighbor. 
DR. PETERS I think you're right. sir.  I think you've hit the nail on the head.

125  INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - DAY                                  125 
Long waiting lines for people trying to leave town. People sleeping on the floors. Chaos. One group gathered around a television set. 
T.V. NEWS BROADCAST - VIDEO 
We see images from crowed refugee shelters. 
REPORTER (filtered) ...every shelter in the tri-state area has been overflowing with displaced people. Tent cities have begun to spring up all over the county... 
As we TRACK away from the t.v. we FIND Nick taking a seat at a small bar next to the gate. A WAITER comes over. 
WAITER Can I get you something? 
Before Nick can answer... 
RAYMOND Pernot, no ice. 
Taking a seat directly across from Nick, Raymond sits down, sizing him up. Nick is confused. 
NICK Do I know you? 
RAYMOND We've met before. 
NICK (remembering) Oh yeah, the insurance guy. 
Raymond pulls out his badge and lays it on the table in front of Nick. 
RAYMOND SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond. 
NICK Sounds like a big company. 
RAYMOND It's the French Secret Service. 
NICK Oh. 
RAYMOND We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest. 
NICK (alarmed) Are you sure? How do you know? 
RAYMOND We know. 
NICK Why are you telling this to me? 
RAYMOND I need you to trust me. 
NICK Why do you need that? 
RAYMOND I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest. 
NICK Oh, my bags. I've checked them in. 
RAYMOND We, have already taken care of them. 
Nick realizes Raymond is serious. The waiter hands Raymond his drink. Raymond toasts Nick. 
RAYMOND Bon Chance! 
CUT TO: 
126  EXT. TENT CITY - AFTERNOON                                 126 
A makeshift tent city has been set up in the park. Animal video tapes an interview with a displaced person. 
DISPLACED PERSON No one tells us a Goddamned thing. My family is getting soaked out here. We have no place else to go. We just want to go back to our home. 
Animal begins to PAN his camera around the tent city when he SEES a SEDAN in the distance. He focus in on it and SEES... 
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - SEDAN - NICK AND RAYMOND 
Coming to stop at a light. Animal quickly lowers his camera and hands it off to the Reporter he's working with. 
ANIMAL I'll be right back. 
Animal rushes over to the news van and takes off after them, following. 
127  EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - AFTERNOON                 127 
Pulling up in front of a warehouse, Nick and Raymond step out of the sedan. Staying hidden from view, Animal pulls over. Intrigued, he watches them enter the building. 
128  INT. WAREHOUSE - RAYMOND'S MEN - AFTERNOON                 128 
Raymond enters with Nick. The room is filled with equipment; radios, guns, explosives and armored vehicles. We notice that more of Raymond's support team are here. 
NICK How did you get all of this stuff into the country? 
RAYMOND This is America. There is nothing you can not buy. 
Raymond gives Nick a tour. 
NICK So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military? 
RAYMOND I am not permitted to speak of such things. 
Nick stops and confronts Raymond. 
NICK You said you wanted my trust, then I need yours.

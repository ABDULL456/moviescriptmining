There's a knock on the front door and Davina answers. She opens the door and tries to shut it immediately. SKINHEAD FAT SETH, from the game earlier, wears a GOOD GUYS STEREO UNIFORM. He pushes the door back open. 
DAVINA What do you want!? 
SETH Open up, bitch! 
Davina relents and Seth enters. 
DAVINA (examining him) Jesus! Are you sure you can fit through the door? 
SETH Fuck off. (excited) Where is he? 
DAVINA Back in his bedroom. 
Seth pushes Danny to the side, passes Doris and yells. 
SETH (smiling) Where are you, you free motherfucker? 
Seth moves down the hall and bangs on Derek's door. 
SETH Vinyard! 
DAVINA He's on the phone, asshole! 
SETH Fuck off. 
DEREK (O.S.) I'll be out in a minute! 
Without pushing it, Seth undoes his pants and moves into the bathroom. Danny walks down the hall. 
INT. BATHROOM - THE CAN 
Seth sits on the toilet. Danny pushes the door slightly and stares at Seth's GUN on the bathroom counter. Danny looks at him. After a few seconds-- 
SETH What are you lookin' at? 
DANNY I'm still trying to figure it out. 
SETH Come in here and I'll show you, maggot. 
DANNY Fuck off. When'd you start carryin'? 
SETH I'm dropping the kids off at the pool, junior. Shut the fuckin' door! 
Danny grabs his nose and turns to the door behind him. 
DANNY Jesus!  Chew your food, dude! 
INT. BEDROOM - DEREK 
He continues into the phone receiver. 
DEREK All right. Thanks.  I'll take care of it. Yeah. 
DANNY'S POV. He opens the door and sees Derek on the phone with his back to him. Above Derek is Danny's surfboard, hanging on ropes hooked to the ceiling. 
Blue jeans, black boots and slicked back hair, Derek holds his hand up and motions for Dan to be quiet. The sleeves of tats covering his arms, shoulders and back (D.O.C.) define the hatred that has engulfed his past. 
DEREK (into the receiver) Okay.  Okay. I'm what?  What channel? 
He covers the receiver, turns on a ten inch TV, and flips to the correct channel. 
DEREK (without turning) What is it, Danny? 
DANNY You got pigs outside. 
DEREK 
I know. 
Derek leans over the computer to check it out. 
INT./EXT. BEDROOM - DEREM'S POV 
He looks through the blinds and stares at the UNMARKED CAR. Danny throws his backpack on the bed and exits. 
TIGHT ON DEREK. He listens to the television. 
TV ANCROR (O.S.) Saturday's prison release of a former skinhead gang leader has many community leaders up in arms tonight.

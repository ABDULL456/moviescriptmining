Connor, Murphy and Rocco sit in a parked van, down the street from the Beaver Cleaver house. The three are sitting next to each other in the longer back seat. They have a counter in front of them with all their guns and accessories on it. 
The clicking of bullets into clips, and smacking of clips into guns are heard. Smecker sits in the captain's chair directly across from them, calmly smoking a cigarette. They finish their preparation. Rocco holds up his guns. 
SMECKER They waited in a parked car down the street for the kid to leave. 
Murphy spies a young boy peddling his bike out of the driveway. He goes to the front of the van. 
MURPHY There he goes. (turns back to them, pulls his guns) Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord? 
CONNOR (cocks his pistol) A-fuckin'-men! 
ROCCO This is so fuckin' cool! 
EXT.  SUBURBAN BEAVER CLEAVER TYPE HOUSE  DAY 
Connor, Murphy, and Rocco make a frenzied exit from the van and walk across the front lawn, each carrying a black duffle bag and clutching a mask. The garage is opened a crack. 
They pull it up all the way. The sun shines in on Smecker who stands there smoking. 
INT.  SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  GARAGE  DAY 
They enter and close the door behind them 
SMECKER They went in through the garage. The kid says he leaves it open when he takes his bike out. 
They dive into their bags and suit up with leather gloves, masks, navy P-coats and their guns. 
INT.  SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  DAY 
The three open the door and enter the house and walk deliberately down the hallway. 
SMECKER (V.O.) Now, they know the wife is the gate keeper. She knows the code. 
EXT. SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  BACKYARD  DAY 
They walk with the terrified woman around the pool to a steel door pool house entrance. There is a number pad next to the door. Rocco positions her in front of it. 
ROCCO Don't fuck with me lady. I'll kill you. 
She slowly punches in the numbers. Smecker is standing there smoking. 
SMECKER The wife says she doesn't know what happened after she hit the code. She just remembers going down. But, judging by the burn mark on her back, I think what they did... 
Rocco pulls a stun gun and zaps her with it. She goes down. 
SMECKER ...was use a stun gun on her. 
Connor reaches for the knob but Rocco stops him. They wait, guns drawn and focus on the door knob. 
SMECKER Now the guy knows a friend is coming to the game. And they know that this door can only be opened from the inside. So they wait... and when that door opens, man... 
The knob turns and they kick it in. 
INT.  POOLHOUSE - DAY 
They burst in and line up shoulder to shoulder, guns aimed. 
Smecker stands beside Rocco with his thumb and forefinger extended to mimic guns. Five mafiosos sit around a poker table in front of time. Two men are playing pool to their left. Rocco quickly scans the room. 
ROCCO All of them. 
They begin firing. Men are dying, their chests exploding. 
Smecker moves his hands like firing guns and yells over the noise. 
SMECKER Nobody was ready for it. Devastation, panic! This was like shooting fish in a fuckin' barrel! 
Smecker points to the pool table as the two players dive under it. 
SMECKER Now these guys dove under the table. The trajectory on the bullets show they came from straight across. So this means one of our shooters... dropped to his knees... 
Smecker drops to his knees in perfect synchronicity with Rocco. They are side by side and leaning back.

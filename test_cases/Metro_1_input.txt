ROPER Oh you thought I was going to ask you... 
Ronnie averts her eyes, a bit embarrassed. 
ROPER Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to Tahiti first and see if that works out... 
Roper picks up his menu and peruses it. 
ROPER I assume you're having your usual -- the "air dried venison". 
INT. HALLWAY JAIL - DAY CLOSE ON 
The wheels of a laundry cart, moving slowly down the hall. A white metal door slides open, and the cart passes through. 
INT. PROPERTY ROOM JAIL - CONTINUOUS 
As the cart rolls into the room TILT UP to see 
KORDA 
pushing the cart. He stops. A GUARD (guard #3) stands with his back to Korda. He's on the phone. 
KORDA Got another load. 
JAIL GUARD #3 Rack 'em up. (into the phone) Look, man, if it doesn't make it down here by five it's not my problem. 
As the guard continues, Korda hangs several garment bags, zipped and tagged, onto an ELECTRIC TROLLEY -- similar to the kind used by dry-cleaners to move clothing. 
KORDA All done. 
Korda pushes a button and the trolley STARTS TO MOVE. The guard, still on the phone, buzzes open the door. 
ON THE GUARDS BACK 
We hear Korda wheeling the cart out the door. 
CLOSE ANGLE 
on the door sliding shut. 
ON THE GUARDS BACK - CLOSE 
Hold a beat. PANNING SLOWLY around the room to FIND -- suit bag's moving on the trolley. BOOM DOWN to FIND Korda's feet just as they lift off the ground and disappear behind the bags. 
ANGLE ON KORDA 
hanging onto the trolley as it moves along the wall and then down through an opening in the floor and into... 
INT. BASEMENT JAIL - CONTINUOUS 
as it loops around a large room, carrying him toward the back wall. The metal ridges of the trolley CUT into his fingers, drawing blood. Then he drops down, and quietly rummages through other bags of clothing. He tries on a pair of pants but they come up to his ankles. He looks like he's about to go wading. As he rips them off and reaches for another pair... 
CUT TO: 
INT. LONG HALLWAY JAIL - LATER 
Korda appears around a corner, dressed in street clothes, holding a CLIPBOARD -- moving steadily toward camera. 
KORDA'S POV - DOWN THE HALLWAY 
A female civilian EMPLOYEE heading in his direction. As they pass he nods and she nods back. Then Korda passes through a door at the end of the hallway and into... 
OMITTED 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. CELL BLOCK - CONTINUOUS 
The door closes behind him and locks with the loud SNAP of metal. 
Slowly, with deliberate steps, he moves down the corridor toward the door at the other end, past the first GUARD (guard #3) -- enclosed in bullet proof glass. 
TRACKING - KORDA'S FEET 
step by step. The voices of prisoners, muffled behind thick glass. 
CLOSE ON KORDA'S FACE 
trying to stay cool, his heart pounding. Then... 
A VOICE (O.S.) Hey! 
Korda FREEZES, then slowly turns to FIND... A prison GUARD (#1) moving toward him. 
THE GUARD POV - MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO KORDA 
KORDA ...Yeah? 
The guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand. 
JAIL GUARD #1 You dropped your card. 
Korda takes THE CARD given to him by the bail bondsman. 
JAIL GUARD #1 You guys are the scum of the earth. 
KORDA Just tryin' to make a living. 
Korda turns and walks out the door into... 
INT. SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
It's the final step before getting out of the building. A small room with another GUARD (Latino; guard #2) behind glass, and several TV monitors. A BLACK WOMAN (forty-five) is arguing with a LATINO GUARD. 
JAIL GUARD #2 I don't know what to tell you, mam, your brother ain't here. Try San Bruno. 
WOMAN I just came from San Bruno -- they sent me here!

{"train": "LOOPER \nWritten by \nRian Johnson \nProduction draft \nEXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY \nA pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain. Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas corn field. Sky pregnant with rain. Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones, stands. Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged. With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man apart with a single cough of a shot. \nLATER Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck. Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them. \nEXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY \nMassive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke. \nJOE (V.O.) Time travel has not yet been invented. But twenty five years from now it will be. Once the technology exists, it will be relatively cheap and available to the public at large. And so. It will be instantly outlawed, used only in secret by the largest criminal organizations. And then only for a very specific purpose. Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse from the flatbed. \nJOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It's nearly impossible to dispose of a body in the future. I'm told. Tagging techniques, whatnot. So when these future criminal organizations in the future need someone gone, they use specialized assassins in our present, called loopers. \nINT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY \nCavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch, opens it, and dumps him in. \nJOE (V.O.) And so. Thirty years from now. My employers in the future nab the target, they zap him back to me, their looper. And I do the necessaries. So the target has vanished from the future, and I've just disposed of a body that technically does not exist. Clean. The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little flare of angry red fire. \nEXT. DINER - DAY \nA sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's truck in front. \nINT. DINER \nNearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A waitress sets down coffee. Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX. \nBEATRIX Bon jour, Joe. \nJOE Bon jour, Beatrix. \nBEATRIX How's the French? \nJOE Slow. How's the coffee? \nBEATRIX Burnt. Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down. \nEXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY \nJoe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized city on the horizon. \nINT. PAWN SHOP - DAY \nGrungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a basket labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSES\u00e2\u0080\u009d Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with a protruding duct taped camera and microphone. \nJOE Two, Jedd. \nJoe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket. A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again. In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open. The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash. Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper. \nDALE Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight? \nJOE Yup. Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves his gun and exits. \nDALE Four, Jedd. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON \nHigh ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city. Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a coffee table in place over it. Puts a bebop LP on a turntable. \nJOE We'll stick backstage, just meeting up. In and out. \nBIG CRAIG Packing your blunderbusses? \nJOE Hardly. Right Seth? \nSETH Hardly. I'm with Joe. Big Craig pats them down, waves them in. \nINT. BACKSTAGE \nA claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages. DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through. Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth struggles to keep up. \nSETH So are we - hey - Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men. \nINT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE \nAn ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet curtained doorway leads to back rooms. Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular, SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained. A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger. \nMADAME No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat Men only. \nJOE So I've read. He ducks out. \nINT. BACKSTAGE \nJoe plods. Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast. Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them. \nSETH Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what- Joe? And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men. \nINT. STEEP STAIRS \nA starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them. \nJOE What? \nDALE Zach. In there right now, with Abe. Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his eyes. \nJOE For what? \nDALE He closed his loop. This lands heavily on Joe. \nJOE No shit? The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder then retracts into the door. The loopers watch him in awe. \nJOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) There's a reason we're called loopers. \nEXT. ABANDONED LOT - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nZach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand. Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's. \nJOE (V.O.) Time travel in the future is so illegal, that when we sign up for this job we agree to a very specific proviso. \nZach raises his gun. \nJOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) If our employers in the future get busted up by the law, their first priority is going to be erasing any trace of their relationship with us ever existing. A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his head kneels in front of Zach. Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes. \nJOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) So. If they're busted, and if we're still alive 30 years from now, they'll find our older self and zap him back to us, like any other job. Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing several dozen gold bars taped to his back. \nJOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) This is called closing your loop. Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face through the sack. \nJOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And you get paid out a mythic amount of money, and you get a handshake and get released from your contract. Enjoy the next 30 years. \nINT. STEEP STAIRS \nZach reaches the top of the stairs, a grin on his face. \nJOE (V.O.) This job doesn't tend to attract the most forward thinking people. \nZACH So are we celebrating? At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty jeans. This is KID BLUE. \nDressed now, Joe double-checks his french book for a phrase and heads out. \nEXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY \nJoe's truck zooms away from the city, into corn fields. \nEXT. CORN FIELD \nJoe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears before Joe. Shoots the man in the chest, without hesitation. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nJoe sits at a booth, the waitress Beatrix brings his coffee. \nBEATRIX Bon jour Joe. \nJOE Ravi de te voir, Beatrix. \nBEATRIX Ooh la la. \nINT. PAWN SHOP BACK ROOM - DAY \nJEDD, 70s and knarled, sits in a tiny closet of a work room. Following a BUZZ, Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in the hall. \nJOE (OVER SPEAKER) Two, Jedd. Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then hands him out a small stack of cash. Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number \u00e2\u0080\u00982'. All the other transactions have the number \u00e2\u0080\u00984'. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT \nJoe smooths out the oriental rug. \nINT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT \nJoe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating at another table. \nDALE What's that, fourth loop closed this month? Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his eyebrows at passing ladies. \nJOE Fourth. On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage. \nINT. BACKSTAGE \nSuzie weaves towards her dressing room. Joe catches her. \nSUZIE Hey. \nJOE You working a shift tonight? \nSUZIE Yeah. \n(REALIZES) Yeah, but one of the gat men bought me out already. For the night. \nJOE Oh. \nSUZIE Sweetie. I gotta work. She leaves him watching her go. He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen this whole exchange. The Kid smirks. \nINT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB \nJoe bursts back into the club with a vengeance. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER \nJoe staggers in. Not doing so hot. \nINT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nLooks at himself in the mirror. Eyes red as candy. He pops open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out an eye dropper and puts one in each. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT \nJoe spins from the door. Considers briefly. \nJOE I can't do anything for you Seth. Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand. \nSETH No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide me, please Christ please Joe please hide me tell em something to buy time and I'll leave please- \nPOUND POUND POUND. \nJOE Hold on! Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug. A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it. Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big enough for a man. Seth scrambles in. Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face, framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the oriental rug. POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door. Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the apartment with over-eager purpose. One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face. \nKID BLUE That took awhile. \nJOE You think it's easy looking this good? \nKID BLUE Tye's going to watch your apartment while we go have a talk with Abe. Joe grabs a jacket. \nJOE There's coffee in the tin. \nTYE Thank you. \nEXT. LA BELLE AURORE - DAWN - ESTABLISHING \nINT. STEEP STAIRS \nKid Blue leads Joe down the stairs and into the door at their base. \nINT. WAITING ROOM \nDingy with a few benches. In one wall three steep stairs lead to a high door. Kid Blue knocks. Muffled voice from \nWITHIN: \nABE (O.S.) Two minutes. \nLATER Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to engage. \nKID BLUE You know why they call that pea shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's impossible to hit anything farther than 15 feet, and impossible to miss anything closer. A gun for fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat. A gat has range. Accuracy. His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome. \nJOE Alright, cut it out Kid. You're gonna blow your foot off again. The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins. \nKID BLUE You're right, it'd be real easy for it to accidentally go off. He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably. \nJOE C'mon. \nKID BLUE Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper. Joe stifles a chuckle. In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe. Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory. Lowers his gun. \nABE (O.S.) What the hell is going on out there- The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the side of the head. His gun goes off, firing into the wall. Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn. ABE, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway. \nKID BLUE S'alright, s'alright. Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again. After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the tension breaks. \nABE Alright. Joe. Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily. \nABE (CONT'D) You didn't shoot your other foot off, didja kid? The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid. \nINT. ABE'S OFFICE \nCluttered, with a big desk. Joe sits, Abe hands him a handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek. \nABE My great grandfather always told my grandfather, men's like spiders. It's the little ones you gotta be careful of. \nJOE Dunno I agree with that. \nABE Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did my great grandfather know. \nJOE (V.O.) This man is from the future. He was sent back here by the mob, a one way ticket, to run the Loopers. That's low effort even for Abe, so to pass the time he recruited some real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he runs the city. Any other city, that'd be impressive. Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe. \nABE How can you kids stand those chokers? This, the cravats. \nINT. SUZIE'S BEDROOM - LATER \nSuzie naked at the mirror. She goes to Joe, lying on the bed, distant. \nJOE I can't remember my mother's face. I remember her touching my hair. Like this. He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in his eyes. \nJOE (CONT'D) Do you want to go overseas? \nSUZIE Do I want to go overseas? With you? Now? \nJOE Soon, maybe. \nSUZIE Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet boy. You gotta be careful, it's easy to think you know someone once you been like this. What's in here is services rendered. \nJOE Is that how it aughta be? \nSUZIE What, in nature? \n(BEAT) You know I get this a lot. Especially young guys. I must have wife eyes or something. His face clouds. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJoe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe. All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side, knocked out of place. He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a bright smear of fresh red blood. \nEXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT \nA hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a train yard. It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence bordering the train yard. Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and wraps first his left hand then his right. But stops. On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist. Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve, revealing his clean bare forearm. Then his face changes. Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere, more intricate scarring has appeared down its length. The scars spell out clearly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15 \nMINUTES\u00c2\u0080\u009d Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast. He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist himself over... and stops again. His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just gone, its stump worn with age. Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well. A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting, leading out of town. Behind him, the city. Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing has changed to a ragged whistle. \nHe lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face... and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be. \nEXT. CITY STREETS \nThe train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back into town. He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his thumb. He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no right hand, just a stump. \nOLD SETH No no no no no! A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying on the sidewalk. He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing. Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the street and into the headlights of an oncoming car. The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face. \nIN THE CAR Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the DRIVER. Jams on the gas. Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel. His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals. \nEXT. WIRE STREET \nThe car hits a pole. Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing a foot, one arm gone to the elbow. Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45. He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone. Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling, an animal form, bellowing wordlessly. Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one arm, slams it. Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings open. \nWith no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement. Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside. Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nJoe wakes with a start. \nEXT. CORN FIELD \nJoe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons. A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots the man in the chest. Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them. Similar. He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the shape of the man's face under the cloth sack. Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror. Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens. \nINT. PLANT - DAY \nJoe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and vanish in a puff of distant fire. \nBEGIN MONTAGE: 1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers celebrate. 2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man. 3. Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars. 4. Joe in the field, BANG. 5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair. 6. Joe in the field, BANG. 7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire. 8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more determined with each shot. \nEXT. CORN FIELD - DAY \nOur montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent. Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch, confused. 2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the man is supposed to appear. Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong. 2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is. But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED. Holy shit. Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on the trigger. Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face that stares back at Joe is his own. 57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe. And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his finger eases on the trigger. It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body into a spin. Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER. The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They caught the blast. In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt and the bar back towards Joe. Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late. Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's head, a fist and then \nTHE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him, still squawking French lessons. Sits up. \nJOE Oh god. Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But realizing. \nLoud and dark. Joe shotguns eye drops right out in the open, dances like a madman. \nINT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY \nJoe's apartment, unpacked and lived in. Joe smokes. In a NOOK behind a wall panel - stacks of CASH. \nEXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY \nCloudy and cold. Joe wanders alone. Buffeted by strangers. \nEXT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT \nMusic pumping, Joe deadened at a table, in another world. Beside him a YOUNG PUNK makes a glass float using his TK power, then shatters the glass. Red liquid goes everywhere. \nINT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY \nJoe takes money from the stacks in the nook, which have grown drastically low. LATER - sets a hypo down in the ashtray. \nINT. PARIS BODEGA - DAY \nA GUN in the face of the shop's OWNER. Held by Joe. Several years older now, in his mid thirties. Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow GANGSTERS. Now part of their gang. \nEXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT \nA shoot-out between rival gangs. Joe's guns blaze. A remorseless killer. Blasting away, cold and skillful. Smashing up shops that won't pay protection. He's muscle. \nINT. PARIS GANG HEADQUARTERS \nA dingy dark hallway. Distant thumping bass indicates it's maybe behind a club. The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly dressed. Reminiscent of the Gat Men. It takes us a moment to recognize Joe among them. In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A soldier. (Note - it is here we transition from the actor playing Young Joe to the one playing Old Joe.) \nEXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY \nSnow on the ground. \nINT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT \nOld Joe high as a kite, in an all out brawl. Punched to the ground. Laughing his ass off. A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around. Old Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his WIFE for the first time. Long red hair (reminiscent of but NOT Suzie.) In a green dress. She flees the fighting, towards the exit. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSORTIE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her. Puts his hand on her shoulder. She turns, looks him over. Flips him off. Leaves. Old Joe watches her go. In love. \nINT. PARIS CAFE - DAY \nOld Joe hits on his future Wife, she tells him to fuck off. \nINT. PARIS BEDROOM - DAY \nOld Joe in bed with his future Wife. They kiss. \nEXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY \nOld Joe shoots up a storefront with his gang. \nINT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY \nOld Joe's future wife yells at him, holding his gun holsters accusingly. She throws them across the room. LATER - He holds her in bed, both of them troubled. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nOld Joe driving. Deep in thought. His future Wife beside him, her hand on his. He hits the brakes. \nEXT. FRENCH BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe car screeches to a halt on a beach side road. Old Joe gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun out of its holster. He fires it out to sea till its empty, then throws the gun into the ocean. He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss. They fall to the sand, and kiss. \nEXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nA cottage in the country. \nJoe wakes slowly, pained. Lying alone in an abandoned lot on the outskirts of town. Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight bandage on his ear. A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason. A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car, heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry. Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard. Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards the city. \nINT. LA BELLE AURORE BACKSTAGE \nA swarm of activity, Gat Men rushing in and out. \nABE (PRE-LAP) He ain't dumb like the last, we gotta get lucky now. Cover the roads out of town. Sweep the streets, pull in his social circle, pound the pavement. \nINT. ABE'S DEN \nMap spread on a table. Gat men gathered around Abe. \nGAT MAN 3 He'll hop a train. Fast and untraceable. \nABE Maybe. Sweep the train yard. Every second that passes is bad, go. \nINT. ABE'S OFFICE \nKid Blue slumps in a chair, holding a rag to a wound on his head. Eyes wet from crying. Abe storms in. \nABE Stupid little shit. \nKID BLUE I can't hear you Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts \nABE Well that's what happens when you fire a gat in a steel box you stupid little shit. \nKID BLUE I can fix this. I can find him. \nABE Go home and let the grown ups work. Kid Blue. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nMore helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing. Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights themselves. Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely avoiding the light. He won't last long out here. \nJOE Where would I go if I were me. \nHe sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the other side with flashlights. Goes back the way he came, turns a corner. \nEXT. SETH'S APARTMENT \nJoe finds himself in front of a familiar BRIGHT RED GARAGE. Seth's apartment. Three stories up, Seth's darkened window. He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate. \nINT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT \nA window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist. A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens, Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables, finds what he's looking for at a desk. A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer. Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and windows, information flashing, searching. \nEXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT \nGat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets. Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An idea. \nEXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit window. Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed on his boot, enters the building. \nINT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT \nOld Joe finishes printing several large documents that look like maps. He folds them up, pockets them. Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops. On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to his wrist. Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve, revealing \u00e2\u0080\u009cB\u00e2\u0080\u009d then \u00e2\u0080\u009cE\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then \u00e2\u0080\u009cA then \u00e2\u0080\u009cT\u00e2\u0080\u009d... He bares his arm, reading the entire message. \nINT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door. Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the screen out momentarily, and the door swings open. Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the apartment with over-eager purpose. Empty. He deflates. Thinks. Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up. A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding. An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe. Kid Blue stops scanning, hits \u00e2\u0080\u0098PLAY'. Joe feels around the door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment. Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here. Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's about to step away when his eye catches something. He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment. Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour. On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring into space. Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something. Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly exits. Kid Blue stops the screen. He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared. The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOFFEE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open. It's full of knives. Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook. Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces together. Lights a cigarette. \nEXT. CORN FIELD - DAWN - ESTABLISHING \nThe sun rises over a flat endless field of corn stalks. \nEXT. CORN FIELD \nOLD JOE (CONT'D) No? Well you'll get there eventually. Obviously. \nJOE I don't care what you're here for, whatever you think you're going to get from me. More time or whatever you want. I can't let you walk away from this diner alive. Because the next 30 years of my \nLIFE- \nOLD JOE JOE I'm sorry to cut off - sorry -are mine they're not yours to cut off this spiel you've they're not yours anymore you been practicing all night, can say anything you want but but I need you to need you to you're not walking outta here listen. Listen. alive \nOLD JOE You know what the voice of god sounds like? See now good you're confused now but you're listening. I hope the voice of god sounds like an old man speaking French. Old men speaking French sound like primeval trees in a strong wind, just irrefutable. Wise, strong, gentle, all these things in harmony, complimentary. At once. Old men speaking French. Young men speaking French sound, without exception, like weenies. Fact. You ever hear a Frenchman under 40 try to sound threatening? It's hilarious. English is a tight t- shirt, flatters the young. Rat a tat tat. French is a double breasted suit. Young man can put it on, but it always feels like he's putting something on. Some things, you just need the years. It's my favorite language. \nJOE I've got a life ahead of me that's mine and I'm not giving it up for you or anybody \nOLD JOE Well you know what you have to do then why don't you take your little gun out from between your knees and do it. One in the head, two in the heart. Boy. It's all \u00e2\u0080\u009canybody\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then you show up here and think you can talk me into dying. Well bullshit we both know you're not going to kill me. Christ you ordered eggs. Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath. \nOLD JOE (CONT'D) I know why you couldn't pull that trigger. When you're tasked to do the unthinkable, your mind, it'll do anything it can to stop you. Only way is you gotta know why you're doing it, in your bones, so you can say it out loud to someone without apologizing. Or you gotta cut yourself off, go numb. But that'll kill you, down the line. \n(BEAT) It's hard to make eye contact with you. It's too strange. \nJOE Your face looks backwards. \nOLD JOE Yeah, that helps actually. That little twist of unfamiliar. \n(BEAT) You're not winning some pissing contest by looking me in the eye, you didn't know what I looked like until yesterday, it makes sense that it's easier for you. \nJOE I wasn't trying to. Do you know what's going to happen? Have you already done all this, right now, as me? \nOLD JOE No not - exactly - I don't want to talk about time travel shit, because we'll start talking about it and then we'll be here all day making diagrams with straws. It doesn't matter. \nJOE When I hurt myself now, it changes your body. Do my actions change your memories? \nOLD JOE It doesn't matter because I don't know how it works. Nobody knows how it works. Time travel was an accident, thirty years from now the smartest men in the world know exactly one thing about it that you don't: they know to be scared to death of it. \n(BEAT) My memory is cloudy, there's a cloud. It's a, it starts clear then gets cloudy as it goes back.. Goddammit hand me those. Straws. Joe passes him two. \nOLD JOE (CONT'D) And the salt. No, the pepper. The pepper. Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and pours pepper between them, thus: \nOLD JOE (CONT'D) Ok, the span between the straws is a timeline of the next 30 years. \nTHIS (the left straw) is the present moment, right now. \nAND THIS (the right straw) is the moment thirty years from now when I was sent back. The machine is tuned to a fixed time, you know that, 30 some years, it's not adjustable. \nJOE What's the pepper? \nOLD JOE The pepper is a sort of fog. See my memories start clear here, (at the right straw) but as they go back they get cloudier, until they're totally obscured. It's like a fog. Because my memories aren't really memories, they're one possible eventuality now, and they grow clearer or cloudier as they become more or less likely. But then they get to the present moment (the left straw) And they're instantly clear again. Like a wall of fog moving forward with the present moment. I can remember what you do after you do it. He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it pushes the pepper with it. \nJOE So you can \nOLD JOE And it hurts. \nJOE So when we're apart you can remember what I do. After I do it. \nOLD JOE Uh huh. But Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws. \nOLD JOE (CONT'D) This is a precise description of a fuzzy mechanism. Time travel fucks everything, my brain and body try to catch up. It's messy. That's why it's dangerous. And it hurts. All I know I know two things for sure. I know what's happening in my head. And I know that you're still going to meet her. \nJOE Who? Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he stares at it intently. \nJOE (CONT'D) This is a woman, what? I'm going to fall in love with? \nOLD JOE She's gonna save your life. Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time, and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it, he breaks off his gaze. The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he turns it into anger. \nOLD JOE (CONT'D) For a long time at the beginning she thought we'd have a baby. She would have been a good mother. She wanted that so much. And now I'm saying sorry to a picture. \nJOE She's. How is she, you said save my life. \nOLD JOE Your life. Let's look. At your life. You're a killer and a junkie. And a fucking child mentality, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat's mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Save your life, you're asking how? The question is why. Why would someone waste themselves on you, give up the good life they had, sacrifice a good life to love you. \nINT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL \nUnderground. We move through it. \nINT. RUNOFF ROOM \nCavernous space beneath a high street grating, damp and cold. Old Joe sits on the ground, methodically cleaning and loading his gun. He finishes. Places the gun on top of his folded, torn maps. Closes his eyes. Sees: \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY) \nA bank of fog clears, revealing Sara's face looking down at us. She slaps us hard. \nSARA Hey. \nINT. RUNOFF ROOM \nOld Joe touches his temple. Head aching. Remembering. \nOLD JOE The first time I saw her face. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY) \nSara's face. SLAP! \nSARA Hey. \nINT. RUNOFF ROOM \nOLD JOE No. No no. His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY) \nSara's face. SLAP! \nINT. RUNOFF ROOM \nOld Joe holds his pocket watch tight like a talisman. Fingers dug deep in his head. \nOLD JOE No. The first time I saw her face. \nINT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT \nA fist comes straight at us. SMACK! We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy. A piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before. Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing hysterically at a YOUNG PUNK who has just hit him. A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around. Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the first time. In her green dress. Whisps of fog drift into frame. \nINT. RUNOFF ROOM \nInside Old Joe's pocket watch, a picture. Of his WIFE. The sun breaks in through the grate above. Old Joe closes the pocket watch, holds in tight. Then he stands and picks up the gun and goes. \nCUT TO: A child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light beaming through. JOE'S FACE - wrecked, but his eyes flutter. Blink. \nINT. BARN - MORNING \nJoe lies on the cot. Blinks. The barn doors, the morning sun rising through. If the child was there, he's gone now. \nINT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING \nCid draws at the kitchen table. Sara enters. \nSARA Morning monkey. \nCID The man's up. Sara stiffens, looks out the window. \nCID (CONT'D) Is he staying here now? \nSARA No. \nA WALL OF LEAVES Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense foliage. \nHEY- And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and SHOOTS HIM. BLAST! Rips his shirt open bloody, blows him back screaming. \nEXT. PARK \nOld Joe STOPS in his tracks, children running around him. His hand goes to his temple. \nEXT. BARN - DAY (OLD JOE MEMORY) \nFog clears from Sara blasting us with her shotgun. \nEXT. PARK \nOld Joe's hand runs from his temple to his neck. Feels a new but old scar, just a little divot behind his ear. \nINT. BARN \nSara drags Joe in by the foot. She heaves the barn door closed. In the lamp lit dark Joe rolls and groans in the dirt. \nSARA Who are you? She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury \nSARA (CONT'D) You're right I'm not a killer but I am fine with how a blast of rock salt to your face won't kill you. Who are you and what are you here for? Who are you? Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his nose. But he forces calm. A beat. Then he starts talking. \nJOE Time travel hasn't been invented yet. But in thirty years it will be. \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nA suburban park. On its far end, a birthday party. The YOUNG BOY in the bright jacket we saw run out of the house earlier sits alone under a tree. Old Joe approaches him. \nOLD JOE Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's father. Aren't you going to come over? We're doing cake. \nDANIEL It's ice cream cake and I can't eat ice cream. Cause of the milk. \nOLD JOE Well you should join the party even if you don't have cake. You have a birthday coming up? \nDANIEL In July. We were gonna go to the lake but I don't think we are now. \nOLD JOE I'm sorry. Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble breathing. \nINT. BARN \nSara sits. Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation. \nJOE I can't go back to the city and find him cause Abe, the boss, all his men are going to search the streets 24/7 till they turn up me or... him. All I have is this map. And that he's coming here. Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought. \nSARA A Looper. \nJOE Yeah. Did you know about Loopers, what we do \nSARA I've heard stories. So he's coming here to murder me and my son because he thinks we might be this Rainmaker. And once he kills the Rainmaker, what happens? \nJOE I think... he thinks, the instant the rainmaker dies, he'll never have been sent back, so he'll just vanish, and be back with his wife. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET \nThe same track home Old Joe studied from the trees earlier. Daniel trots towards it, coming home from the birthday party. \nINT. BARN \nSARA Who is he? The guy you let run? Just some random guy from the future? \nJOE Yeah. Someone. You know what these numbers mean. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD - DAY \nWell tended by someone who loves growing things. Laurels, ivy on trellises, flowers and trees. Daniel comes through the side gate. Lifts the back door matt, revealing a dusty key. \nINT. BARN \nJOE If I'm out here and you're in the house we're gonna need some way to communicate. \nSARA There's a dinner bell down by the barn, ring that if someone's coming, I'll hear it. \nJOE Dinner bell. We need walkies, or buzzers. \nSARA Dunno what we've got but I'll look. She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them. \nSARA (CONT'D) Cid. She goes to take him inside. \nJOE Got any ammo for that shotgun? That isn't a seasoning? \nINT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nSara leads Cid back into the house. \nSARA How's the maths coming? \nCID I wanna help the man. \nSARA Help him what? \nCID I could help him with my toys. \nSARA Baby. Listen. I need you to stay away from that man. Okay? Let him- \nHEY Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but angry slap. She grabs his arm harder. \nSARA (CONT'D) Let him do his thing, but you stay with me. \nCID Is he not good? \nSARA Well we're gonna see what he is. But you stick with me. Yeah? \nINT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - EVENING \nOld Joe's little hide-out. He violently washes his hands in a trench of water. Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face. Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above. Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water. His eyes close. His breathing shallows. In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other on the gat. The map beneath it. Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining. And the missing corner, edge torn. CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep. Then from nowhere a CHILD'S HAND enters frame and rests on his forehead. Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror \nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT \nbut it's Joe who wakes up with a start. Slumped against the steps, gun in hand. Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his finger to his lips. Shhh. \nINT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT \nCid leads Joe inside, beckoning him to follow. \nINT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN \nDark. Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table. Laid out on it: an arrangement of toys. With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a flashlight and sets it on the table. Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid. \nCID Hand me that Phillips. Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working. \nCID (CONT'D) Tell me if you hear her coming. \nJOE What are we doing here? \nCID Commundication. He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and an identical one next to Joe lights up. The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly. \nCID (CONT'D) But I need to make it stronger. \nJOE How do you do that? \nCID Bigger battery. Joe idly fingers a toy. \nJOE Smart. \nCID Do you kill people? Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows. \nSARA What? \nJOE You said you were his mom. \nSARA Uh huh. \nJOE He told me you're not. This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it. \nSARA He said that? \nJOE If he's not your son who is he? \nSARA \n(SHARP) He's my son. \n(BEAT) I had Cid when I was twenty two. But I didn't want to give up my life. In the city. The word \u00e2\u0080\u009ccity\u00e2\u0080\u009d has weight for her. Implies volumes. \nSARA (CONT'D) So I dropped Cid with my mom, here. And my sister. And they saw how I was living and they took him. My sister raised him here, she loved him. He called her mom. \nJOE How'd she get killed? When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers. \nJOE (CONT'D) Cid told me. You have to talk to him about it. Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare. \nSARA I told you one thing, I told you to stay away from my son. \nJOE He asked about my gun. You think this is going to go away if you don't talk to him about it but it's just gonna grow \nSARA Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away from my son. \nShe goes back to chopping. Joe lingers, then leaves. She hacks away. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING \nSara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in thought. She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette. \nEXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING \nA motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed. Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205. Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot. Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath. The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping exhausted, up the stairs. And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by. It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face, pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be. He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing. Towards apartment 205. Jesus it can't be. Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes, relieved. She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely indistinct conversation between her and the girl that answers. \nSUZIE Sorry, I know I promised five, you know how it gets. \nGIRL NEIGHBOR Don't worry sugar. She was no problem. Gat men searched through here, lookin for god knows... Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters. \nOld Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to be shitting me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205. Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window. On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap. Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife. Old Joe watches them for a long time. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY \nJoe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand on his blunderbuss. Beside it, his frog buzzer. The tension is constant. And it's a long, long day. \nINT. FARMHOUSE HALLWAY - LATER \nSara vacuums while Cid plays with toy trucks. \nINT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER \nIn the basement, bare concrete. Sara empties the dryer. \nINT. CID'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nSara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a plastic multiplication table. \nSARA Where does 56 go? Good. 21. \nCID How long can you not sleep? \nSARA I don't know, awhile. That's a good question. Where's it go. Good, there. 32. \nCid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes back away from him. Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens. And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts out of the room. \nEXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY \nSara walks fast down the hall \nINT. SARA'S BEDROOM \nNot slowing, through her bedroom \nINT. SARA'S CLOSET \nInto her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back. She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside. \nINT. SAFE \nCloses the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light. And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening. \nEXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nCid's screams from the house, clear as day. Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards the house, not sure what to think. The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying corn. \nINT. CID'S BEDROOM \nThe math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies face down on the bed, cried out. Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other tight. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - DAY \nA Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in hand, and gets in his car. \nINT. CANADY'S CAR \nCanady starts the car up, starts driving. \nSomehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the passenger side foot-well. \nKID BLUE Hey Can. Can. Canady sees him, jumps and yelps. The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car. Coffee everywhere. \nCANADY Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the \nFUCK \nKID BLUE Pull into that alley. \nCANADY You get the fuck outta \nKID BLUE You don't wanna be seen with me Canady, pull in the alley. Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley, parks it. \nCANADY The fuck are you still doing in town, Abe wants you dead man \nKID BLUE All Abe wants right now is the looper. Unless he got him last night? \nCANADY Jssshhh. No we didn't get him. Spotted and lost him. West End, near Whore's Alley. \nKID BLUE Whore's Alley? \nCANADY That area, Mott & Talbott, little working girl colony. \nKID BLUE (has a thought) Whore's Alley.. \nCANADY You shoulda left town man. \nKID BLUE I'm gonna bring him in, get right with Abe. \nCANADY Yeah, maybe you bring him the looper, but short of that Abe don't get right with priced men. \nKID BLUE I got a price? \nSARA Eight. Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe slipping through the hall and into the living room. He lifts his glass, drinks. \nJESSE Thank you. \nSARA I'll show you round the grounds, then the house, then you can be on your way. Sara holds the screen door open for him. \nJESSE We'll start with the house. Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him. \nINT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM \nHe sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara follows him. \nJESSE Eight, you said? Boy? And your husband. Just gotta, check in. With the home office. This goddamn thing. \nSARA This man dangerous? \nJESSE Tween you me and a lamppost? No. Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My boss has half the city's looking for him. Half the city and me. So. And if you find him, there's a helluva price. Think on that if he comes by, acting sweet. Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs. \nIf Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day. Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a GUN with his hand. Asking Joe. Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently creeps down the stairs. He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't look up from his phone. Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands. \nJESSE (CONT'D) Alright, show me upstairs. The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks sharply at Sara. \nSARA Drafts, in the house. Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway. Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe. \nJESSE (O.S.) This door doesn't latch? \nSARA (O.S.) It used to, it's busted. Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in. \nINT. FARMHOUSE FOYER \nCid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him. \nJESSE Drafty house. \nSARA Farm house. Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it. CREAK. He looks at Sara. \nJESSE What's down there? \nSARA Laundry room. Door must've blown open. \nJesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely. \nJESSE Two things. First, I have a family of my own back in the city, and I want to see them again. Second if anything happens to me, and I don't report back to my boss people in fifteen minutes, they're gonna know I disappeared searching this house, and inside of another fifteen you'll have an army of more me's kicking down your door. Ok? \nSARA It's a laundry room. Jesse motions - her first. \nINT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM \nBare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge. No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the hamper. \nJESSE You want to call out whoever's hiding in that hamper? \nSARA If someone was hiding in the house, that's what I'd do. But nobody is in the house. Open it up. \nJESSE No I think I'm gonna put a shot through it just to be safe. He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly. \nJESSE (CONT'D) You wanna call him out? Sara stays silent. A long beat. Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty. She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's empty. \nSARA Now if you promise not to wag your gun at my shoe rack I'll show you upstairs then show you the fuck out. She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his gun and follows her. The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the room, and into a drain hole under the hamper. \nINT. TUNNEL \nDark and earthy. Cid leads Joe with his flashlight. \nEXT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON \nJust outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens two inches. Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the house. \nJESSE We're going now. We're gonna go to my truck, you're gonna CREAK. Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed. Jesse, purely on instinct, spins and draws on Cid. Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls back. Everything slows down. \nINT. APARTMENT 205 \nOld Joe pushes the door open. Blackness within. \nINT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM \nThe room darkens. As if the sun passed behind a cloud. Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid- scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles down the stairs. Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to catch Cid. Sara runs behind him. The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room rattle, then LIFT INTO THE AIR. All of them. Floating. Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES into the air. \nINT. APARTMENT 205 \nOld Joe readies his gun, staring into the blackness. But his eyes lower. He touches his temple. Remembering. \nINT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (OLD JOE'S MEMORIES) \nFog clears - Joe is almost to Cid, who is still tumbling, nearly at the bottom of the stairs. \nINT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (NORMAL) \nBut just before he reaches him, Sara shoves Joe from behind. Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR. He's confused but her face is set. Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched. Screaming. His scream louder than it should be. \nBigger things in the living room RISE OFF THE GROUND. Chairs. The couch. And Jesse. He rises five feet in the air, terrified. Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground screaming like an animal, and just as they cross the threshold, Jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood. \nINT. APARTMENT 205 \nOld Joe's face. Remembering. \nINT. FARMHOUSE FOYER (OLD JOE MEMORY) \nFrozen in a tableau - Cid screaming, raw power. Jesse EXPLODING. A bright red fan. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH \nJoe and Sara fall out and down the stairs. The front door and windows EXPLODE in a burst of splinters and glass. \nINT. APARTMENT 205 \nOld Joe's eyes lift. Realizing. \nOLD JOE The Rainmaker. A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on. A six year old girl's room. But the only person in it is Kid Blue. He shoots Old Joe with a blue tazer. Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed. Knowing the answer now, knowing the who and the how but helpless and defeated. Kid Blue kicks him in the face. \nCID \nINT. ABE'S OFFICE \nA Gat Man circles a spot on the map in red ink, Sara's farm. \nGAT MAN 1 He's there. Lost his signal five minutes ago, right after he sent word he had him. Joe. Abe slumps in a chair, taking oxygen from a tank. \nABE Call everyone, every Gat Man in the city, call \u00e2\u0080\u0098em here. Gather em all up here first. No mistakes this time. We're gonna take an army to that farm, all at once, and sweep it like hellfire. Now. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING \nFrom a high vantage point. Cars, bikes, Gat Men on foot, all heading towards the club. An army, all meeting at the Belle Aurore. Massing to attack. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING \nMoments after the blast. Joe and Sara lie in the dirt. Jesse's TRUCK parked nearby. Joe stirs first. Stands shakily. The front door jam is splintered. Windows broken. He goes inside. Sara gets up, staggers in after him. \nSARA Cid! Cid! \nJOE (O.S.) Cid! \nEXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE \nJoe bursts out of the screen door, holding his Blunderbuss and wiping off Jesse's gat. Bloody Cid-sized footprints lead out the screen door and streak across the lawn, into the corn. Sara comes out after Joe, sees him heading for the corn. \nOld Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle into the smoky aftermath. And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man. The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that. Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys. It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper. \nINT. ABE'S OFFICE \nEmpty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find the door to Abe's inner den. \nINT. ABE'S DEN \nAbe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table. Watching the door. A display screen shows Old Joe on the other side. Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door \nABE Joe. Guess I put the gun in that kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess everything comes back around. Like your goddamn ties. \nINT. ABE'S OFFICE \nOld Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun. \nEXT. HIGHWAY \nJoe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the middle of the highway. Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his Blunderbuss. \nINT. COAT CHECK - LATER \nKid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully. Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his chest is grazed. The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead. \nINT. BACKSTAGE \nKid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men. \nINT. ABE'S DEN \nAbe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes. Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING \nClothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat. \nSARA Ok baby, we're going. \nEXT. HIGHWAY \nJoe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored truck. Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in. The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between them. \nOLD JOE Bon jour. You take this truck, you take your money, and you go live your life. No one's coming after you. I fixed it. \nJOE And you go kill the boy. That's how you fix it. \nOLD JOE That's how. You got your life back, you better think right now about what that's worth to you. \nJOE My life? Your life. Becoming you. \nJoe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot scatters. The old man flinches, backs away. Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold. \nOLD JOE Stupid little shit! You let him live, he's gonna take away everything that's yours, everything that's mine! You seen what the boy's gonna become. \nJOE I haven't seen that yet. Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's chest and knock him back. Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has until now blocked our line of sight down the highway. Kid Blue. The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to the dusty pavement. The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a stop and spin it around. Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss. Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as a rock. Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires scattershot. Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe. Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round after fiery round. Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud. KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to slow the bike but can't in time. In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him. He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly FIRES his buss. A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without a driver. It skids, crashes. When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head. \nBesides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue. Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes: Old Joe is gone. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN \nSara starts the truck up. \nSARA Here we go. Give it a wave goodbye. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD \nThey roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway. At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them, is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand. Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him. \nCid stands. Intense, eyes dark, in another place. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE \nOld Joe, suspended mid-air, realizes what's about to happen. He lifts his hand defensively and SCREAMS \nEXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA \nCid's face straining, about to scream. Cid's focus adjusts from Old Joe to Sara. She floats, reaching out to him. Frightened. Yelling something he can't hear but he can see her eyes. Cid's face breaks. He barely mouths the word \nCID \nMOM And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes crashing down. \nEXT. EDGE OF FIELD - CONTINUOUS \nThe corn stalks shiver then are still. \nJoe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field. Gasping for breath. Gets his bearings. In the far distance across the field, Old Joe, Sara and Cid. Too far. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA \nCid runs to Sara, who sits up slowly. They embrace. \nSARA You did good, baby. You did so good. I love you. Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid. \nSARA (CONT'D) Into the fields. Run now baby. Go. \nCID \nNO \nSARA \nGO NOW \nCID No no mom no \nSARA You go! She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing her ground. Directly between Old Joe and Cid. Old Joe TRIPS in the mud, fumbles his gun. Sees Cid approaching the safety of the CORN STALKS. Blocked by Sara. \nOLD JOE Move! \nEXT. FIELD - WITH JOE \nStill too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as Old Joe closes in on Sara. He fires his buss at Old Joe, but is way out of range. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA \nOld Joe gets his gun, rises with it. Cid about to hit the stalks. Sara between them. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH CID \nCid nears the corn fields, running. Seconds from safety. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA \nOld Joe. Gun raised. Pocket watch wrapped around it. His wife's picture in it. Clear as day. No time to move around Sara. Now or never. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH JOE \nJoe running, useless gun in hand. \nJOE No! \nEXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA \nSara, not going anywhere. \n", "test1_input": "OLD JOE It's been thirty years for me, so it's hard to remember. When you stole Seth's bike you stripped out the security tracker. Right? Joe's fearful face says \u00e2\u0080\u0098no.' Old Joe draws his gat. \nOLD JOE (CONT'D) Make it to the field, you can lose them in the field. Go east and hop \nA TRAIN Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES. \nJOE I've got him! He's here! A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old Joe gets the gat. With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe returns fire, glass breaking and chaos. Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks. Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet. Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe. \nOLD JOE Shit. Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the broken window, jumps... \nEXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING \n...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn. \nEXT. FRONT OF DINER \nKid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out, followed by Joe. \nDINER GAT MAN The back, he's running! \nJOE Around back! \nThey all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the corn but not there yet. The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after him while running but they're too far away (and they're running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly, sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the dust. When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated. It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the Gat Men fires. \nKID BLUE Alive! No, alive! Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition. \nCLICK. \nJOE No fuck no fucking piece of shit CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike the engine turns over with a ROAR. The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground. Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running back to the Gat Men. \nKID BLUE The tracker! Get the tracker! \nEXT. CORN FIELD \nJoe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out of sight. Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map. Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and scattered farm houses. One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK. \nSARA \nEXT. FIELD - DAWN \nA bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts the dead stump of an old tree. A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart. Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn. Sara focused on her work as the sun rises. \nEXT. CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING \nSara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn fields, spraying something chemical. \nINT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING \nSara makes coffee. \nEXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING \nShe sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible cigarette. Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it has been here for awhile. The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white. Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going anywhere. \nINT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING \nBlinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in, puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot. \nSARA C'mon baby. Time to get up. \nINT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING \nCooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up. \nINT. FARM HOUSE FOYER \nThe screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The latch is broken. She sighs. Then freezes. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN \nSara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn, shotgun extended. Not fucking around. Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn fields, where she plants herself and shouts: \nSARA Listen up fucker. I have shot and buried three vagrants in the past year. If you want to know the Christ's honest truth I'm starting to get a taste for it. So I don't care what hobo sob story you've got, I get a dozen a week and it cuts no cash with me. It's me and my husband here, we're broke and angry at our lot in this world and heavily armed. So take some corn and move on, but if you show your face again I will cut you the fuck in half. Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara turns, walks briskly back. Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field. \nLATER Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a clear sight line at the house. His gun on his knee. JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces. Pinches his eyes. Headache. The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map. \nJOE C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. \nEXT. CITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nHelicopters sweep by. \nINT. ABE'S OFFICE \nAbe stands fuming, flanked by two Gat Men. Kid Blue sits like a kid in detention. \nABE Well. You found him. And you russeled up a posse and went to git \u00e2\u0080\u0098em. Like a good little cowboy from one of your movie movies. Without telling me. \nKID BLUE I can do it again. \nABE You can fuck up again? Really. You know what happens to me if I don't get that old bastard? I got too much riding, Kid, I can't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy. Put your gat on the table. Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he doesn't take his hand off it. \nKID BLUE I wanted you to say I did good, that's all I wanted. This is all I have. Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the table. \nKID BLUE (CONT'D) Please just give me one more chance, I'll bring him here alive and hold him and you can put a bullet in his brain yourself- Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing it. Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him. \nINT. STEEP STAIRS \nKid is literally dragged up the stairs by a Gat Man. \nINT. BACKSTAGE \nThe Gat Man shoves Kid Blue through the twisty maze of backstage, past girls and Loopers and men. \nThe Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls himself halfway together. Make a show: \nKID BLUE I'm gonna make this good again. I will. I'm gonna be back. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY \nRaining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards the street. But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes. \nKID BLUE Oh no. Oh no no no no He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps, begs, clasps at whatever he can grab. The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end. \nKID BLUE (CONT'D) No! No! No no no no! Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the concrete. The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without ceremony. BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES into the wall. He drops like a doll. Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg hiked up, showing his boot with its holster. In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps stashed. His pinkie on the trigger. \nKID BLUE (CONT'D) Oh. Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a soaked rat. \nEXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT \nSilent and still. Sara comes out onto the front porch. She gathers up a few things, turns out the porch light. Notices a floodlight still lit on the BARN across the yard. She turns the porch light back on. The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening. She steps back in the house, emerging again with the shotgun. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT \nSara stalks towards the barn, shotgun in hand. Shadows loom across the yard. All is silent. \nEXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nShe reaches the barn. A hard pool of light from a mounted floodlight falls off to inky darkness. Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps off. In its absence the darkness swarms. She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops. Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch. And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark. \nSARA Hey. Who's there. Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back. Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a shape. A man. coming towards her. \nSARA (CONT'D) Stop right there. Stop! \nEXT. CORN FIELD - CONTINUOUS \n", "test1_id": 2571, "test2_input": "Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn. Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty. Disoriented. Something is wrong with him. In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man pursues her slowly but steadily. \nJOE \nSHIT His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he scrambles in the dirt for it. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN \nSara backing up still, shotgun leveled. The man, still in darkness, comes towards her. \nSARA You stop right there, you stop! She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS. \nINT. 2ND STORY BEDROOM - NIGHT \nFrom a CHILD'S POV - We run across a darkened bedroom to the WINDOW. A child's hand smacks the glass, and framed through the pane, through the unseen child's eyes, this is what we \nSEE: Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun. In trouble. The DARK MAN, advancing towards her menacingly. At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised at the Dark Man. And the Dark Man STOPS. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS \nJoe's gun leveled, face set. But the porch light on the man's face: it is not Old Joe. It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A greasy sign around his neck: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPLEASE HELP MUWTE FOOD $ GOD \nBLESS YOU\u00c2\u0080\u009d Joe lowers his gun, face melting. \nSARA Jee sus. (to the MUTE VAGRANT) Hey, hey. I'm going to get you \nSOME FOOD- But the man scampers off, leaving his sign. \nSARA (CONT'D) ...great. \nEXT. SECOND STORY BEDROOM WINDOW \nThe child, in darkness, watching. He recedes into the bedroom, his hand slipping off the glass. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN \nSara stands, picks up the sign, calls after the MUTE. \nSARA Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn hobo sign oh for godssakes. (turns to Joe) Alright, what are you? Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling to a heap on the grass. Sara checks his face. \nSARA (CONT'D) Hey. Look at - hey. The fuck- ehh. Joe PUKES. She steps away. Takes a moment. Breathes. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER \nShe drags Joe up onto the porch, under the light. \nSARA Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey. Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face. She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined, swollen under the lids. \nJOE \n(TOTALLY GONE) My head... splitting apart... time eventualities, he said- \nSARA How long since you dropped? \nJOE \nDROPPED Sara mimes an eye dropper. \nSARA Dropped, or what the kids call it. \nJOE A day. \nSARA One day. Wow. She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in thought. Deciding what to do. Joe lies prone, shaking, sweating. \nJOE Thirsty. I can't feel my legs \nSARA You're withdrawing from a synthetic barbiturate. It's a quick punch but it's this bad a day in, without care you might not make it through the night. Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold. \n", "test2_true": "JOE Thirsty. Thirsty. Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the porch, 6 years old, named CID. Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks. \nSARA (O.S.) \n(SHARP) Cid. C'mere monkey. Cid goes back into the house, leaving his cup with Joe. \nINT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nSara tries to pick Cid up but he dodges, walks up the stairs. \nCID Who's that man? \nSARA Just a vagrant babe. \nINT. FARMHOUSE UPPER HALL \nSara leads him down the hall and into his bedroom. \nCID No he's not. \nSARA Oh yeah? \nCID His shoes are too shiny. \nSARA Well aren't you a smart monkey. \nINT. CID'S BEDROOM \nHe gets in bed. \nCID Is he sick? \nSARA Yup. \nCID Will he get better? \nSARA Yup. \nCID Promise? \nSARA Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby boy. Kisses him. \nCID Night Sara. Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nA darkened highway, the lights of the farm house distant. A small STAKE BED TRUCK rumbles up, stops on the soft shoulder. Sara at the wheel. Sits a second. Then climbs out. Roughly pulls Joe out of the flatbed. He lands in the dirt. Sara avoids looking at him, closes up the flatbed. Joe weakly grabs her ankle. She pries his hand off, and discovers CID'S CUP in the dirt beside him. Takes it angrily, strides back to the truck. \nINT. STAKE BED TRUCK - CONTINUOUS \nSara gets in, drops Cid's cup on the seat beside her. Looks in her rear view mirror. Leaving a man to die. Looks down at Cid's cup. For a long moment. \nSARA Ssssshhit. \nINT. BARN - NIGHT \nSara lights a gas lamp. Threads a hose from a tank of water around the cot. Joe on a metal cot, covered with blankets. \nSARA Water. Drink it, all night, more than you think you want. Moves a metal bucket next to the bed. Adjusts the blankets. \nSARA (CONT'D) Aim for the bucket. And don't chew your tongue off. In the morning we're gonna talk. \nThe last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and take his gun. On her way out she puts it on a bench beside the door, and turns out the floodlight. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING \nDawn breaks. Exhausted Gat Men dutifully patrol the streets with flashlights, stopping every passerby. On the outskirts of the city. Vagrant fires burn distant orange. A large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek. \n", "test2_id": 2572, "test3_input": "The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea. THROWS his gun in the ocean.

CHURCH - EVENING \nRain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew. Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out. \nEXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE - EVENING \nOddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered. In plain sight. Not caring. Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a street garbage can. He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can. His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain. The picture of his Wife inside. Spinning. His gun slowly slipping from his grasp. \nWith each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears cloudier. Blurred. Indistinct. Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the photo is nearly gone. \nOLD JOE'S EYES. \nINT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nOld Joe staggering to his feet from a fight. We've seen this before, it's the IDENTICAL SCENE to the previous flashback. But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG grow, blotting out the scene. Deep in the fog are other backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces. Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory. Erasing it. \nOLD JOE'S EYES. \nINT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nOld Joe in bed with his wife. Baby crying outside. Her face. Then, whisps of FOG thickens, obscuring them. \nOLD JOE'S EYES. \nEXT. FRENCH BEACH - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nThe thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to the beach. But where his Wife was in the previous memory, now there is the FOG. A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of nothingness falling towards him. \nOLD JOE'S EYES. The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of decision. \nINT. SARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSara lies in bed. Eyes wide open. Still and quiet in the dark. Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her. A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it. Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then sound: a door opening in the house below. \nQuick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door flies open. Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other. His eyes adjust to the dark. \nJOE What? Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head doesn't know where to go. \nSARA Don't wake Cid. She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain starts to fall against the windows. \nLATER Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned. Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the air, spinning, then drops. \nJOE That's pretty good. \nSARA In the city, young guys would hit on me by floating fucking quarters, I wouldn't tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em I was TK but I'd keep their quarters down. One guy busted a blood vessel in his eye trying to get it up. \n(BEAT) He's you. Your loop. You lied to me. She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious. Joe sits up. \nSARA (CONT'D) But you protected Cid. And I know you're not lying that you're gonna kill this guy, your own self. Even though he's protecting your future. \nJOE He's protecting his future. Not mine. A beat. \nSARA When I came back, after my sister died. Cid was sitting on the porch, I remember seeing him for the first time, in two years. \n(MORE) \nSARA (CONT'D) Saw him on the porch. I drove up crying and I had been at a party in the city when I got the call, I was wearing this ridiculous party dress. All my ridiculous shit. I don't know if he remembered me, but he looked at me. I abandoned him. I abandoned my baby. \n(BEAT) Maybe I can't be a mother to him, is that something I can't get back. When he looked at me then, on the porch, he was mine again, he was my son. I seen so many men in the city, who I look in their eyes and they're lost. Whether he loves me back or not I'm gonna love my son I said. And he's never gonna get lost.

PAWN SHOP BACK ROOM - DAY \nJEDD, 70s and knarled, sits in a tiny closet of a work room. Following a BUZZ, Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in the hall. \nJOE (OVER SPEAKER) Two, Jedd. Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then hands him out a small stack of cash. Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number \u00e2\u0080\u00982'. All the other transactions have the number \u00e2\u0080\u00984'. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT \nJoe smooths out the oriental rug. \nINT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT \nJoe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating at another table. \nDALE What's that, fourth loop closed this month? Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his eyebrows at passing ladies. \nJOE Fourth. On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage. \nINT. BACKSTAGE \nSuzie weaves towards her dressing room. Joe catches her. \nSUZIE Hey. \nJOE You working a shift tonight? \nSUZIE Yeah. \n(REALIZES) Yeah, but one of the gat men bought me out already. For the night. \nJOE Oh. \nSUZIE Sweetie. I gotta work. She leaves him watching her go. He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen this whole exchange. The Kid smirks. \nINT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB \nJoe bursts back into the club with a vengeance. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER \nJoe staggers in. Not doing so hot. \nINT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nLooks at himself in the mirror. Eyes red as candy. He pops open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out an eye dropper and puts one in each. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "JOE Jesus, Seth. \nSETH They're gonna be here any minute, are they here? \nJOE No, they're not here. Who? \nSETH Christ. Joe. Christ. Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns the apartment lights off. \nSETH (CONT'D) (re: the lights) What are you doing? Right. Smart. \nJOE Seth, sit down here. CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table. \nSETH Late to my own funeral. Mom always said... \nJOE Tell me now. \nSETH Christ, Joe. Late to my own goddamn funeral. Can you help me? \nJOE Seth, what did you do? \nSETH You can protect me a little, right? Just so they don't... jeez. Oh jeez. This is like a nightmare. This is a nightmare. \nJOE (V.O.) I knew then what he did so I don't know why I asked. \nJOE (CONT'D) What did you do? Seth lifts his eyes to Joe. \nSETH He was singing. \nEXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nFLASH: a hog-tied man with a sack over his head appears. Singing. Seth, with his gun raised, hesitates. \nSETH (V.O.) Through the gag and mask, but I could hear the tune. Deep memories, my mom in a dark room, singing. Back warm and safe, when I coulda still been good. And once I knew it was him... Joe I couldn't. I couldn't. I had to see. Seth pulls the sack off the man's head. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT \nSETH Joe I can't even tell you. Looking in his eyes. I had to let him talk, then. I don't even remember the words, but I remember believing every one of them, or not even believing, but submitting. I've never felt that small before. I've never felt that happy. He told me. I remember, there's a new holy terror boss-man in the future, and he's closing all the loops. The Rainmaker, they call him. He told me. \n(MORE) \nSETH (CONT'D) Then he wanted a cigarette and I untied him, and he gives me this look. And he just starts running. \nEXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nSeth standing with his gun in his limp arm, receding behind us as we run away. \nSETH (V.O.) And I had my blunderbuss so I know he's got about fifteen strides till he's out of my range. And they come and go, and I just watch him till he's gone. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT \nSeth breaks down crying. \nJOE (V.O.) This is called letting your loop run. It's not a good thing. \nSETH What do I do? You're the only friend I got Joe you gotta help me \nJOE You fucking idiot coming here. Seth, sucker punched. \nJOE (CONT'D) You can't be here, I'll give you a little money but you gotta \nSETH Joe? A little - where am I gonna - \nJOE You hop a freight train, you beat it the hell out POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses \nJOE (CONT'D) Shut up. Don't move. Goes to the door. Two GAT MEN and Kid Blue stand outside. \nKID BLUE Open up Joe! (to the gat man) Watch the window. \n", "test1_id": 2571, "test2_input": "SARA Eight. Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe slipping through the hall and into the living room. He lifts his glass, drinks. \nJESSE Thank you. \nSARA I'll show you round the grounds, then the house, then you can be on your way. Sara holds the screen door open for him. \nJESSE We'll start with the house. Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him. \nINT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM \nHe sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara follows him. \nJESSE Eight, you said? Boy? And your husband. Just gotta, check in. With the home office. This goddamn thing. \nSARA This man dangerous? \nJESSE Tween you me and a lamppost? No. Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My boss has half the city's looking for him. Half the city and me. So. And if you find him, there's a helluva price. Think on that if he comes by, acting sweet. Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs. \nIf Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day. Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a GUN with his hand. Asking Joe. Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently creeps down the stairs. He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't look up from his phone. Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands. \nJESSE (CONT'D) Alright, show me upstairs. The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks sharply at Sara. \nSARA Drafts, in the house. Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway. Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe. \nJESSE (O.S.) This door doesn't latch? \nSARA (O.S.) It used to, it's busted. Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in. \nINT. FARMHOUSE FOYER \nCid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him. \nJESSE Drafty house. \nSARA Farm house. Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it. CREAK. He looks at Sara. \nJESSE What's down there? \nSARA Laundry room. Door must've blown open. \nJesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely. \nJESSE Two things. First, I have a family of my own back in the city, and I want to see them again. Second if anything happens to me, and I don't report back to my boss people in fifteen minutes, they're gonna know I disappeared searching this house, and inside of another fifteen you'll have an army of more me's kicking down your door. Ok? \nSARA It's a laundry room. Jesse motions - her first. \nINT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM \nBare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge. No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the hamper. \nJESSE You want to call out whoever's hiding in that hamper? \nSARA If someone was hiding in the house, that's what I'd do. But nobody is in the house. Open it up. \nJESSE No I think I'm gonna put a shot through it just to be safe. He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly. \nJESSE (CONT'D) You wanna call him out? Sara stays silent. A long beat. Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty. She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's empty. \nSARA Now if you promise not to wag your gun at my shoe rack I'll show you upstairs then show you the fuck out. She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his gun and follows her. The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the room, and into a drain hole under the hamper. \nINT. TUNNEL \nDark and earthy. Cid leads Joe with his flashlight. \nEXT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON \nJust outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens two inches. Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the house. \n", "test2_true": "A deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door. Joe squats, Cid stands. \nCID My granddad built it, but he didn't tell anyone of us why. Nanna said cuz he was nuts. \nJOE Thank you granddad. \nCID That wasn't the man. \nJOE No. I know him, that's what's funny. His name's Jesse. I like him. He'll go away when he doesn't find me, he won't hurt her. They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking back towards the highway. \nJOE (CONT'D) My mom gave me up. I was younger than you. We were vagrants, and she was alone, for a long time I thought she was stupid for getting on the drug she was on, it was bad stuff, it probably ended up killing her. \n(MORE) \nJOE (CONT'D) But now I see, she was so alone. And it was what she had. She sold me. To a panhandle gang. QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into darkness by rough men, screaming. Then we're back to the scene. \nJOE (CONT'D) But I got away. And I ran and I ended on a train, sitting in the dark in an empty freight, going to the city, and I saw myself over and over killing those men who bought me and who got my mom on what she was on. Finding them and tearing them apart. Saving my mom. \nCID But you didn't. \nJOE A man in the city found me, put a gun in my hand, and gave me some things. I didn't have my mom anymore. I had my work, my money. My plans. For my life. That's what I'd kill for. Not something I don't have, and can't ever get back. \n(BEAT) There's just men figuring out what they'd do to keep what's theirs, what they got. That's the only kind of man there is. \nCID I'm not gonna let Sara get killed. Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but doesn't. \nJOE I think we're clear. He opens the trap door, climbs out. \nEXT. BARN \nJoe reaches down to help Cid out. Looking down at Cid in a hole with a trap door. Like Seth. He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out. Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief. Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace. \nSara and Joe share a look. Joe quickly turns his eyes back to the corn fields. \nINT. SECURITY MONITOR ROOM - EVENING \nA tiny, dark concrete room. Kid Blue watches a screen, his hand on a toggle wheel. A security cam view of Suzie's apartment building upper landing. Playback of last night. It scans quickly forward. The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him, counting money. \nKID BLUE All working girls, yeah? \nSUPER Uh huh. This whole block. You wanna check those too, I can arrange. \nKID BLUE I do. On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the playback. \nKID BLUE (CONT'D) \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lo Joe. Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him intently. Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves. Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket. \nSUPER I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha. But you don't see what you wanna see, no refunds. Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels. \nEXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING \nKid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot. Looks up at Suzie's apartment door. Then down the street. A few drops of rain fall. \nEXT. FRENCH CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nDriving on a highway along the beach. A few drops of rain on the windshield. Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense conversation, her hand on his. \nOLD JOE (IN FRENCH) But I will. \nWIFE (IN FRENCH) You want to, I know that. But you won't. \nOLD JOE (IN FRENCH) I'd do anything for you. \nWIFE (IN FRENCH) You'd do. You'd kill for me, you'd take life for me. But I don't want that. You kill for what you love, but someone loves the person you kill, and it starts again. I don't want that. I can't love a killer. What would you give up for me? That's yours? \nOLD JOE (IN FRENCH) Anything. She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A moment, in thought. \nEXT. BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS \n", "test2_id": 2572, "test3_input": "Cid stands. Intense, eyes dark, in another place. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE \nOld Joe, suspended mid-air, realizes what's about to happen. He lifts his hand defensively and SCREAMS \nEXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA \nCid's face straining, about to scream. Cid's focus adjusts from Old Joe to Sara. She floats, reaching out to him. Frightened. Yelling something he can't hear but he can see her eyes. Cid's face breaks. He barely mouths the word \nCID \nMOM And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes crashing down. \nEXT. EDGE OF FIELD - CONTINUOUS \nThe corn stalks shiver then are still. \nJoe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field. Gasping for breath. Gets his bearings. In the far distance across the field, Old Joe, Sara and Cid. Too far. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA \nCid runs to Sara, who sits up slowly. They embrace. \nSARA You did good, baby. You did so good. I love you. Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid. \nSARA (CONT'D) Into the fields. Run now baby. Go. \nCID \nNO \nSARA \nGO NOW \nCID No no mom no \nSARA You go! She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing her ground. Directly between Old Joe and Cid. Old Joe TRIPS in the mud, fumbles his gun. Sees Cid approaching the safety of the CORN STALKS. Blocked by Sara. \nOLD JOE Move! \nEXT. FIELD - WITH JOE \nStill too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as Old Joe closes in on Sara. He fires his buss at Old Joe, but is way out of range. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA \nOld Joe gets his gun, rises with it. Cid about to hit the stalks. Sara between them. \nEXT.

Dream-like. Slow. Old Joe shoots Sara. We hear no gunshot. Just the wind in the corn, and young Joe's breathing. She falls, giving him a clear shot at Cid. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH JOE \nJOE WATCHING: \nEXT. FIELD - WITH CID \nJust as Old Joe gets him in his sights, Cid breaches the corn fields and is gone, vanishing in the stalks. Old Joe lowers his gun, stunned but still frantic. He stumbles towards the corn, still far off, his face breaking. Trips, falls in the mud. Corn field vast in front of him. Cid is gone. He lost him. He holds his pocket watch. Sobs. Lost. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH JOE \nJOE WATCHING: \nEXT. CORN FIELDS \nOn the horizon, a train. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH JOE \nJOE WATCHING: \nINT./EXT.

And Joe breathing. Time hanging, slowed nearly to a stop. A moment of decision. Joe turns his blunderbuss back on himself and FIRES. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA \nRevealing that all we saw was in Joe's head, and we are still in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara. But this time, just as he's pulling the trigger, a distant shot is heard. And Old Joe DISAPPEARS. Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment. Then she doesn't process any of it, she just turns and yells \nSARA \nCID! \nEXT. FIELD - WITH CID \nCid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field. There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is gone. The field is empty. \nEXT. FIELD - SEEN FROM JOE'S POV \nWe don't see Joe, but far across the field Cid runs to his mom, into her arms. Sara lifts him, holds him. \nEXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA \nShe carries him. Walking fast back towards a far distant figure lying still on the edge of the field. Joe. Then a faint buzz. The flasher, in her pocket. She pulls it out. Two flashes. She slows. Stops. Looking at him, far away. Two flashes. \nCID Where's Joe? \nSARA He had to go away, baby. \n", "test3_id": 2573}

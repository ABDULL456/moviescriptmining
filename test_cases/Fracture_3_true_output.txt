Willy savors the moment. Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy briefcase - goes to shut off the light and open the door - - which swings about six inches, then clonks into something. Willy grimaces.   Peeks out, goes to pound on a wall. 
WILLY Mrs. Demello? (Beat) MRS. DEMELLO!    Your CAR! Silence. He sighs.    Shuts the door and presses a button near the light-switch. There's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves. He presses the garage-door-opener button again, and hurries across the apartment to duck out under the closing door. 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
Willy straightens and takes a breath, re-settling his suit jacket with an irritable glance at his landlady's car, parked sloppily next to the garage, blocking his door. As he walks away, down the alley, we rise up to reveal the hazy sprawling landscape of L.A. - and the towers of Downtown, rising ahead of Willy like Oz. 
WILLY (V.O.) Come on, Phil: I called you as a courtesy, and you start looking to take advantage? 
INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING 
An ancient fluorescent-lit cubby crammed with documents, case files, notes, reference books. Willy on the phone: 
WILLY I'm not knocking it down to a Class C. My backlog of open cases does not mitigate the fact that your client tried to kill his brother-in-law with - oh, right, a "golfing accident"? Your client owns one golf club and no golf 
(MORE) 
WILLY (cont'd) balls - and the "accident" took place in the stairway of an illegal after- hours gambling club. Yeah, okay - I'll see you in court. His cell phone rings.   As he gets it: 
WILLY Well, I won't see you in court, but someone from this office will. You take it up with them, I gotta go. (switching phones) Willy Slocum. Oh - hey, hi, yes. Assistant District Attorney NORMAN CHANG (mid-30s) throws the door open without looking: 
NORMAN Wooton Sims?! Willy holds up a finger, talking into his cell: 
WILLY No, I didn't.     Wow.   Okay. Norman mouths "WOOTON SIMS?!" repeatedly during: 
WILLY No - short notice is...fine. No, I can. Black tie. Sure. What time? Okay. Yes. Thank her. He hangs up, exhales slowly.    Looks at Norman. 
NORMAN Wooton - SIMS?! Wooton Sims?! 
WILLY Please stop saying, "Wooton Sims" over and over. It's starting to sound like nonsense words. 
NORMAN You asshole! 
WILLY Okay: go back to "Wooton Sims." As Willy gets up and goes out, past Norman - 
NORMAN How the hell did you get a job at Wooton Sims?! I can't even get an interview! 
INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Norman follows Willy out to a central bullpen area where the shared ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS work: MONA and GLADYS. 
NORMAN I've been here five years. I'm your supervisor. I graduated USC, summa! 
WILLY We're just going to pretend he's not talking, okay? 
MONA                            NORMAN No problem.                     I'm serious. 
WILLY I'm really jammed-up all day, and I need to rent a tuxedo - for tonight. 
NORMAN A tuxedo?! Oh, come on!     You are so full of shit. 
WILLY (Jotting notes) There must be a place that does that, right - same day? I'm also gonna need a messenger to bring it here. This is my suit size and my shirt size...I really appreciate this. Mona nods, taking notes as Willy gets out a credit card. Other DDAs are gathering to soak up some vicarious kicks. 
MONA What's going on? 
WILLY Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats to this charity opera thing every year, because Bob Wooton is the chairman of this committee - 
NORMAN "Bob" Wooton?!

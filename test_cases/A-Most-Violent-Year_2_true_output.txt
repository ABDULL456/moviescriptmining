ABEL Let me see it. Is this going to make you safe? 
With that he uses brute force, probably hurting her arm, but she doesn't let on. He takes the purse from her. He opens it and takes out the small gun. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You know who uses guns like this? (HE SCREAMS) Whores! 
With that, she SLAPS him across the face. They just stare at each other for a very long time. ABEL (CONT'D) It's a trap... and you are walking right into it... You need to get that thing out of our house. 
ANNA You need to protect us. ABEL That is what I'm doing. 
He walks out the front door. 
INT. MAIN LIVING/DINING ROOM OF MORALES HOUSE - NEXT DAY 
There are twelve SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS sitting around the dining room table yelling "Happy Birthday" to one of the Morales daughters as she blows out the candles. A large GROUP of the PARENTS surround the table. 
GROUP Happy Birthday! Just as ELIZABETH blows out the candles the doorbell rings. NANNY MARIA heads to the front door. The camera stays with the party. NANNY MARIA comes back into the room and standing behind her, we see a POLICE OFFICER holding some kind of clipboard. 
ABEL walks over quickly trying not to create a scene. He leads the POLICE OFFICER back over to the front door. The PARENTS certainly notice and start stirring. 
EXT. FRONT STEPS - DAY 
ABEL leads the OFFICER outside, and as he looks up he sees that his driveway is packed with four police cars, some unmarked and there are about five OFFICERS waiting to come into the house. 
ABEL I understand. But as you can see this is a terrible time for us. I am having my daughter's birthday party. 
ABEL is trying to remain calm and not lose his temper. 
POLICE OFFICER I understand and I apologize, I do. But this is a warrant and we need to gain complete access to the property. 
They stare at each other just as ANNA comes to the door. She sees the scene in her driveway. 
ANNA What is this? 
POLICE OFFICER Let me go check something. 
ANNA Are they serious? 
ABEL is seething and can only manage a slight nod. 
As they look across the driveway they see the OFFICER talking to someone. The officer shifts out of the way and they see he is talking to ASSISTANT D.A. LAWRENCE. 
ABEL I'm going to kill this guy. ANNA Abel. 
ANNA is trying to get his attention quietly. 
ABEL Abel. 
He turns and they look at each other. She signals towards the library and they share a knowing, concerned glance. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Give me five minutes. 
She nods and heads down the path towards the police and LAWRENCE. Abel heads back in the doorway. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Maria. Keep the kids playing for a few minutes. 
ANNA walks up to the LAWRENCE. 
ANNA Mr. Lawrence is it? 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE Yes. ANNA Anna Morales. 
She reaches out her hand to shake his with a smile. 
ANNA (CONT'D) May I speak with you for a minute. A.D.A. LAWRENCE (thinks, then) Yeah. 
They walk away from the others down the driveway a stretch. 
ANNA I understand you and your men have a job to do here. But we are in the middle of a seven-year-old's birthday party. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE I understand, and I'm sorry. But we are coming in. She turns a little on him. 
ANNA That's not a problem, as we have nothing to hide from you. It's just that, we recently moved to this area, and there are twenty guests in our house... please... can you give me five minutes so we can ask everyone to leave calmly before you come into my home? 
He thinks this through. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE You can get them out of the house. 
ANNA Thank you.

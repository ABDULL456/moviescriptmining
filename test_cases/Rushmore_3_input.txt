DIRK 
Who sold you that crock? 
MAGNUS 
He told me himself. He says she gave him a hand job in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar. 
DIRK 
Max would never say that. 
MAGNUS 
(smiles) 
Yeah. You're probably right. After all, the son of a brain doctor doesn't need to impress anybody. 
Buchan laughs wickedly and fires off another throwing star. 
INT. GROVE CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. NIGHT 
The school auditorium . Max is onstage dressed as a South Central lowrider called Little Juan. He is opposite a senior named 40 OUNCE and Margaret Yang, who plays Blue Eyes. While they are rehearsing the scene a MESSENGER comes in with an envelope for Max. 
LITTLE JUAN 
The killing has got to stop, esse. It's getting too loco. No more gats. 
40 OUNCE 
Nigger, you're the crazy one. Motherfuckers be wanting to kill you. Are you talking about getting rid of your gun? 
LITTLE JUAN 
It's time, homey. 
BLUE EYES 
Kiss me, Little Juan. 
MAX 
(suddenly out of character) 
Then he kisses her and we're out. OK. 
(pointing to the messenger) 
Is that for me? 
The messenger gives Max the envelope. Max opens it. 
INSERT LETTER: 
Written neatly in blue crayon on paper torn from a spiral notebook. Dirk reads in VOICEOVER dripping with sarcasm. 
Dear Max, 
I'm sorry to say that I have secretly found out that Mr. Blume is having an affair with Miss Cross. My first suspicions came when I saw them frenching at the museum, and then I knew for sure when they went skinny dipping in Mr. Blume's swimming pool, giving each other hand jobs while you were taking a nap on the front porch. Why am I telling you this now? Because you're such a good friend. Take care, pal. 
Fondly, 
Dirk Calloway 
EXT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. NIGHT 
Mr. Blume puts on his jacket as he walks down the front path from Miss Cross' house. He gets in his Bentley and starts the engine. He looks in the rearview mirror and sees the glowing red tip of a cigarette. He wheels around fast. 
Max is sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette. 
BLUME 
Max! 
MAX 
How was she, Herman? 
BLUME 
Jesus Christ! 
MAX 
Was she good? I bet she was. Although I wouldn't know cause I never screwed her. 
Blume flicks on the lights. Max has tears all over his face. 
MAX 
(with bitter contempt) 
Going skinny-dipping while I took a nap. Are you comfortable, Max? I'll just be out nude getting hand jobs from the woman you love. 
MR. BLUME 
(frowns) 
We never went skipping dipping. 
MAX 
Sure, you didn't. And next you're going to tell me you didn't just walk out of her house at two o'clock in the morning. 
MR. BLUME 
(pause) 
I'm in love with her. 
MAX 
Well, I was in love with her first. And all that crap about, I don't think she's that great, I don't think she's right for you, Max. That was all bullshit, wasn't it? 
Silence. 
MAX 
Do you think she's in love with you? 
MR. BLUME 
I don't know. 
MAX 
Well, I guarantee you she's not. 
And she never will be. 
MR. BLUME 
Look, Max - 
MAX 
I saved Latin! 
Max glares at Mr. Blume. He shakes his head. 
MAX 
What'd you ever do?

Behind him, Ellie sweeps the floor.    Their dream has gone unfulfilled. 
Carl has an idea.

Carl buys two tickets to South America. 
EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON

He runs to her. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
Ellie lies in a hospital bed.    She looks through her 
ADVENTURE BOOK. 
A BLUE BALLOON floats in to the room.

Ellie pushes her Adventure Book toward him.    She weakly pats his cheek and adjusts his tie. 
He kisses her on the forehead.

FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. CARL'S BEDROOM - MORNING - SEVERAL YEARS LATER 
An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES.    An aged hand shuts it off and picks up the nearby glasses. 
CARL sits alone in his double bed.   He rubs his face. GRUNTS. He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES. 
He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom spokes. 
INT. CARL'S STAIRCASE - LATER 
Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the staircase. This takes a LONG, LONG time. 
Three quarters of the way down, the chair stops.    He bangs the armrest and the chair restarts. 
INT. CARL'S KITCHEN - LATER 
Carl eats breakfast by himself.

INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - LATER 
Carl looks in the hall mirror. He puts on his hat and considers his reflection. He straightens his GRAPE SODA PIN. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS 
Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside. The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain.      Carl GRUMBLES in frustration. Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door shut, and looks as if he's about to go somewhere. 
He sits in his porch chair. 
EXT. CARL'S NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

110 COFFER SWINGS OFF HIS HORSE FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL OTHERS. 
COFFER I knowed I wounded' three -- but I wasn't sure about -- 
THORNTON (as the others yell in 
PROTEST) Jabali:... 111 JABALI, AN AGING NAVAHO INDIAN trots up to.him'. 
THORNTON This pelt should clear you up -- take him back to town...and tell Harrigan to get me a list of every Army garrison and payroll schedule on the border. (to.the.others, crossing to his horse) We got another half hour of light and they might be just up ahead counting their money. 
EXT. BANDIT CAMP - DAY (SUNSET EFFECT) 
112 PIKE AND HIS MEN RIDE INTO THE RUINS OF A SMALL RANCHERO. A young boy takes their horses while an old.man and his wounded son (the father of the boy) watch. Behind them, an ancient woman pays no attention as she slaps tortillas into shape. Two small children watch, big-eyed. ;113 THE MEN ARE QUIET WITH FATIGUE AS THEY DISMOUNT AND TIE. j THEIR HORSES.. FREDDY SYKES, a skinny old man in tattered range clothes, crosses to Pike as he unloads his saddle bags. 
SYKES Them others ain't comin'? 
PIKE No. 
SYKES (after a moment) None of 'em? 111 PIKE TAKES THE BAGS OUT OF THE CORRAL TO THE FIRE that burns near an adobe wall and drops them on a poncho, watches as the others do the same. 
SYKES (joining him again; worried) But I got horses and gear for all them fellers like you said -- 
PIKE They won't need them -- we will. Sykes thinks this over, finally nods. a little and turns away. 115 LYLE AND HIS BROTHER AND DUTCH STAND in a half. circle around the poncho. waiting. Angel, the last, drops his saddle bag, then crosses to the wall and drops down to rest. For a long moment the men look down.a-t the pile of saddle bags. 
LYLE About the sharing up... 
PIKE 
(WEARILY) The sharing up's going to be the some as always.

115 CONTINUED 
LYLE (whining; pointing to 
ANGEL) Tector and I don? t like the idea of him getting the same as us...He's just starting out and this is our stake for new territory. Pike looks at him silently. He has heard this kind of argument many times in the past and it is obvious he is sick to death of it. Lyle finally looks awa- at his brother; 
TECTOR And I figure a 'share to that old man for watching the horses is a share too much. ll& PIKE TAKES A KNIFE OUT OF HIS BELT, opens a saddle bag,. takes out a sack of silver, kneels to slit the bag open. 
LYLE You hear me, Pike? -- I said it ain't fair... Pike stands,. flips the knife into the ground, faces the brothers. 
P IKE 
(SOFTLY) If you two boys don't like equal shares why in hell don't you just take it all? They look at him silently. 
117 DUTCH DRIFTS AWAY A LITTLE TO TIE SIDE OF PIKE. â¢SYKES MOVES OUT OF THE BACKGROUND, a buffalo gun now dangling from one arm. The brothers tense. Angel laughs softly. 
PIKE (almost a whisper) Well,..why don't you answer me, you dapnned yellow.-livered trash? The brothers fide, et., look at each other. 
LYLE Ah.--' Pike, you know... 
CONTINUED 
117 CONTINUED 
PIKE (his voice a whip) I don't know a damned thing except I either lead this bunch or I end it -- right now; 
LYLE No, sir -- we divide just as you say. Pike looks at them a moment, then picks up his knife and alicea open a bag and -turns it upside down and dumps the contents onto the spread-out poncho watching as: 
118 STEEL WASHERS POUR 01 0 THE PONCHO 119 THE GROUP IS SILENT IN DISBEL'EF staring at the pile of worthless steel. Hykes eases up, takes a cautious look. 
TECTOR Rings:, Steel rings! 
DUTCH. (quietly). Washers! 
120 PIKE TURNS AWAY. LYLE TAKES ANOTHER BAG AND CUTS INTO IT. More-washers pour out. _ 
PIKE (under his breath) Son of a bitch! 121 LYLE'S BOOT FLASHES INTO THE PILE. The washers fly in all directions. Lyle whirls on Pike. 
LYLE Washers...we shot our way out of that town for a dollar's worth of steel holes. He kicks into the pile and scatters Washers across the clearing. 
PIKE They set it up:

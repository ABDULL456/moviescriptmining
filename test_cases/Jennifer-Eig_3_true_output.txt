An academic question considering the Zippo went down a ravine. 
BERLIN No! Get me to that garbage dump! I'm gonna find that fucking dog! 
36:  EXT.  CITY DUMP.  CITY OF EUREKA.  NIGHT. 
Gloom congeals around flashlights. A winter mist falling down. TRIMBLE and Doberman watch as BERLIN goes at it with a shovel. A dozen graves already dug and he's halfway into another. Des- pite the cold he sweats in shirt sleeves. Also breathless and rests to catch his wind. "Don't you have to go to bed?" No he doesn't. He wants to see the victim. Digging recommences with TRIMBLE supplying the light. BERLIN suddenly stops. "Get that lamp down here." White lime. Black fur. They've found the Dog. 
BERLIN begins an examination holding a tiny flashlight in his teeth. Eyes excitedly back to TRIMBLE and gesturing towards a bag. "That bag there. You find a knife and a paira long-nosed pliers." TRIMBLE does it relishing the snap of a switch-blade. 
BERLIN still busy with the light in his mouth. TRIMBLE pissed because he can't see what's happening. BERLIN removes a crump- led bullet from the back of the Labrador's skull. Holds it up for scrutiny. Small calibre. Badly distorted. "Looks like a 22?" 
BERLIN You didn't shoot him did you? 
TRIMBLE Me .. I love dogs .. Ask him? 
37:  INT.  ANTI ROOM/ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. 
LETTERS BIG AS A HOUSE. And Loud. The printer reciprocates as fast as its mechanics are capable. Details coming in from San Diego. VICAP Case Number/F.B.I. Case Number/Victim Status/etc etc. Letters smacking into paper too fast to read. But one de- tail is repeated constantly and underlined. "Identity Unknown." 
Transmission ends and BERLIN hauls at least a yard of homicide out of the machine. Can't believe what he's looking at. "Jesus. He hit six." Reads as he walks back into the big room and gets interrupted by a call. "Miss Robertson. Holding." He heads for the phone with eyes following ANN "Find Ross for me, will you?" 
BERLIN (Phone) Berlin .. yeah .. that's nice of you, Helena, but I already found out .. black, yes .. No, no, of course not, good of you to call .. You heard a what? .. A hollow car? 
A hand shoves papers at the edge of his vision. TAYLOR looks a mite cheesy. "You got a minute for this?" And BERLIN nods sure. 
Yes, I'm still here .. Why didn't you mention that? .. I see .. Al- right, we should talk again .. No, I'm just south of my eye-lids in it right now .. How about Sunday? 
38:  EXT.  COAST ROAD.  HUMBOLDT BAY.  EUREKA.  DAY. 
The first shining day of November. Sand dunes and an infinite stretch of beach. Behind the sea-break is a lagoon and a tiny harbor.  Berlin's Mercedes descends the coast road towards it. 
39:  EXT.  HARBOR.  HUMBOLDT BAY.  EUREKA.  DAY. 
Ross's boat is a 35 foot fisherman. Shining brass and varnish. But like him it's getting on and often grumpy. This last qual- ity presently evident in both. Engine roaring and ROSS is cov- ered in oil. BERLIN has to shout above the racket to be heard. 
BERLIN .. I put the slug in for a ballis- tics report, the man tells me, for get it. Soft lead, it's worthless .. I think, fuck it. And fuck Citrine. I call a friend of mine in Los Ang- eles, and he runs our whole damned show through a main-frame looking for anything similar to our ladies shot with a twenty-two - you don't believe what he finds in San Diego .. 
ROSS detours eyes to wave at his Son. "Watch those revs there." 
Would you shut it down a min- ute, Ross? This is important. 
ROSS signals BOBBY to turn off. And the diesel splutters down. 
ROSS Alright, let's take a walk around the block .. I gotta buy a gasket .. 
40:  EXT.  QUAY/HARBOR.  HUMBOLDT BAY.  DAY. 
Seagulls and sunshine and probably Saturday because the place is busy. ROSS walks with BERLIN up a wooden quay. Their journ- ey will take them across a small bridge towards a Marine Shop. 
BERLIN Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head. 
ROSS How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months? 
BERLIN They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity. 
ROSS Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this. 
BERLIN That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you. 
ROSS Listen to me saying what? 
BERLIN I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years .. 
ROSS For a dead dog? 
BERLIN We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer Eight." 
And this is the second time they stop and stare at each other. 
That old Wino on the heap wasn't a suicide. He stumbled into some- thing, saw something, and whoever took him out knew how to fake it. 
ROSS That isn't what you said before. 
BERLIN I was wrong. 
Says it with remarkable humility considering he's the "expert." 
I'm going in to see Citrine this afternoon. Will you come with me? 
ROSS You're not .. He's in hospital .. He was trying out a new pair of skis in his hallway. The phone rings, and he goes for it, and falls off. He must be the only skier in Northern California to break a leg in his living room. 
They arrive at the Chandler's with BERLIN in no mood to smile. 
BERLIN You believe me, don't you? 
ROSS What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes .. 
But he doesn't really believe it. And doesn't enjoy saying no. 
But I can't help you with this. We can't go through the door with two contentious issues, you with a mass murderer, and me with the Mayor's best friend. Do that, we lose both. I'm sorry, Bro, you're on your own.

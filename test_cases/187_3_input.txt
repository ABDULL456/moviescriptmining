ELLEN Trevor... 
TREVOR (unravelling) I'm sorry but everyone can't always get what they want. Sometimes you gotta take responsibility for your actions. Have you ever been ready to die for a fundamental principle? They haven't. You think those punks would die protecting your Civil Rights? 
ELLEN Trevor, don't. 
TREVOR Did you know Cesar hits his mother? Steals money from her purse? Did you know that? 
Ellen blanches. 
TREVOR Did you know he was here that night? In the alley? 
ELLEN (confused) What are you talking about? 
TREVOR Cesar. Jack was provoked.     It wasn't an accident, Ellen.    Cesar killed him. 
Ellen just stares at him.       Traumatized... 
ELLEN (momentous deliberation) Where'd you get the rosary beads?

TREVOR (pause and...) I like you, Ellen. I like you so much. Do you believe that? 
ELLEN (riveted) Yes. 
Trevor can't find words. 
ELLEN ... I don't know you. 
With that, Ellen turns and walks out of the house as quickly as she came. 
TREVOR (plaintively) ... You do know me. I'm a teacher, just like you. 
123A   EXT. STUDENT QUAD/QUEBRADITA - AFTER SCHOOL                  123A (CINCO DE MAYO) 
ESTABLISH hoardes of cowboy hats, belt sashes and boots as they dance to the loud Mexican band music on the patio... 
Non-Hispanics, along with non-Quebradita cliques, look on from the lawn area... 
DAVE CHILDRESS 
hanging back, on the fringes, scoping out the crowd. Notices a pack of cigarettes in the chest pocket of a 15-year-old kid standing next to him. Kid's wrapped up in talking to another kid, points to something O.S. 
CHILDRESS (to the kid with cigarettes) ... Don't you know it's not polite to point at people. Everytime you point a finger at someone else... (demonstrates) ... There's three fingers pointing back at you. (lesson over) Lemme have a cigarette.

122   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - MEN'S BATHROOM - AFTER SCHOOL          122 
... Cinco de Mayo. The sounds of a QUEBRADITA waft in from outside in the quad. 
At the same time, Steve follows him into the rest room. They're all alone. 
STEVIE Eh, Mr. G? 
Bracing himself with a fixed, straight-ahead look. 
STEVIE (boldly) I'm talkin' ta you, Garfield. (beat) Know what you did to Cesar. (wild notion) ... I'm thinkin' maybe you did Benny, too. (incredulously) That possible? You crush my friend's skull? Fuck 'im up wit' a two-by-four, maybe a baseball bat? 
No response.   As Trevor starts to leave, Stevie blocks his path. 
Trevor steps to one side to go around... but Stevie blocks his path again. 
TREVOR (trying to maintain) Please, step out of the way. 
STEVIE ... You kill my friend?   Huh? 
Trevor's head begins to swim. His life's falling apart. Like a trapped animal, he back-pedals a step to escape... but then suddenly snaps. 
He explodes into Stevie, crushing him against the bath- room wall. 
Trevor impales Stevie with a look that says it all. 
Stevie immediately shrinks. Trevor now blinks. Cooling himself down. Slowing his breathing. Stevie slips out from under his hold and bolts for the exit.

123   EXT. STUDENT QUAD/QUEBRADITA - CONTINUOUS ACTION             123 
Cesar and his tag-bangers... Cesar holds court, drowned out by the MUSIC. Now Stevie arrives. Out of breath. Urgent to tell his story. 
Rita... Makeup subdued, wearing a cotton button-down blouse. She watches the Quebradita from behind a tree. A desire to be part of it, she moves a little closer... 
... as Cesar notices her. His head races from Stevie's news. Eyes penetrating. Now galvanized. On a rampage, he shoves his way through the crowd. 
Victor Sifuentes... on the opposite side of the patio, snapping a look, spotting Cesar moving in for the kill. With a start, Victor barks something into his walkie- talkie and squeezes his way into the Quebradita crowd... 
Cesar shoves Rita to the ground. 
CESAR School girl bitch!

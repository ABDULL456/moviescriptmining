SERGEANT (from behind the door, 
ROARS) 
BLOODY HELL! WHAT'S GOING ON OUT 
THERE! Zed and Oh exchange worried looks. Then the door flies open and the SERGEANT, a huge, angry, sadistic rhino of a man, fills the door frame. SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd) Who the hell screamed? They all point at Oh. SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd) (glowers at him) I thought it was a woman. He lumbers over and gets his face very close to Oh's. SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd) You don't look like a woman, but maybe you want to kiss me anyway. Is that right? You want to kiss me? Oh turns away from his foul breath. The sergeant grabs Oh by the throat and practically lifts him off the ground. SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd) By morning you'll be sorry you were born. 
OH Don't have to wait 'til morning. 
ZED Hey! Why don't you pick on someone your own size? The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed. ZED                                                             (cont'd) (quickly backpedaling) Which would be difficult since there are probably very few people around who actually are your size-- He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head. 
Official White                                                                                   66. 
SERGEANT (to another guard) Get my big stick. I'll deal with the fat one first. 
ZED 
(INSULTED) Relatively fat one. I wouldn't be talking about fat, if I were you. Another blow from the sergeant. ZED                                                           (cont'd) Right. Enough said. The sergeant rips open Zed's shirt exposing his back, then steps up behind Oh and does the same. A guard hands him a lethal-looking bat studded with sharp spikes. 
SERGEANT (to Zed and Oh) Welcome to Sodom. As he takes a big backswing, Zed and Oh shut their eyes and prepare for the worst. 
VOICE                                                         (O.C.) Stop! Zed and Oh turn to see Cain at the door, dressed like the other guards in breastplate and helmet. 
CAIN Wait! I know these guys! 
ZED AND OH Cain? 
CAIN Brothers!! He embraces them. They look confused and doubtful, but relieved. 
CUT TO: 
40                                                            EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT - LATER   40 
Cain leads them through the narrow crowded streets. People avoid Cain's gaze and part like the Red Sea to allow him through. 
Official White                                                            67. 
CAIN You know, you guys are lucky that sergeant is a friend of mine. I let him sodomize me once right after I got here and he's been real nice to me ever since. 
OH 
(SARCASTIC) Yeah, thanks for saving us. What are you going to do to us now? Cain stops and looks at them. 
CAIN wait a second. Do I detect a tone here? 
ZED All right, honestly? You did sell us into slavery. 
CAIN (instantly offended) Whoa whoa whoa! Hold a grudge much? That was like a fortnight ago. 
ZED That was way less than a fortnight. Half a fortnight, maybe. 
CAIN Give me a break! I was dealing with the death of a close family member and I needed some space. But now I realize that you guys are like my brothers. And it's so rare to find a brother that you love. Right? He embraces them. 
ZED AND OH 
(UNEASILY) Right. 
CAIN 
(EXUBERANT) Now, you guys hungry? Watch this. Cain walks up to a food vendor's stall and stares menacingly at the VENDOR. He raises his fist. The vendor cowers. 
Official White                                                             68. CAIN                                                            (CONT'D)   (cont'd) (to Vendor) That's two for flinching. Cain grabs two lamb kebabs and hands them to Zed and Oh. CAIN                                                            (cont'd) That's the kind of love I'm talkin' about. As they eat hungrily, Zed makes eye contact with a prostitute lounging in a doorway. 
ZED Check out that woman across the street! She's looking at us. The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth. 
OH We are so in! She's eye-knowing us like crazy. 
CAIN You're gonna love Sodom. Trust me. It's crazy. This morning, I almost got a handie behind that pita stand.

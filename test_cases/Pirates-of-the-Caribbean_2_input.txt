Will heads for the door. Jack searches the desk, cupboards. 
JACK Not without my effects. 
WILL We need to go! 
Jack finds his pistol, sword belt, and compass. Straps on the belt, checks the shot in his pistol. 
WILL (CONT'D) Why are you bothering with that? 
JACK My business, Will. As for your business -one question, or there's no use going. (joins Will at the door) This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her? 
WILL (no hesitation) I'd die for her. 
JACK Good. 
EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - MORNING 
The Jolly Mon, four inches of water in the bottom, squats low in the water, heeled to one side, creaking on its lines. 
JACK (O.S.) Ah, now there's a lovely sight! 
Jack hops down into the boat. Prepares to make way. 
JACK (CONT'D) I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report her. Honest men are slaves to their conscience, and there's no predicting 'em. But you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way... 
Jack notices that Will is standing, frozen on the dock, staring at the boat in dismay. 
JACK (CONT'D) Come aboard. 
WILL I haven't set foot off dry land I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded. (regards the boat) It's been a sound policy. 
JACK No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us. 
Will steels himself, steps into the boat as if its going to capsize with the slightest movement. Jack hoists the sail. 
JACK (CONT'D) Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably. 
He nods toward the H.M.S. Dauntless, looming in the harbor. Will whiteknuckles the gunwales. 
WILL We're going to steal a ship? That ship? 
JACK Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term. 
WILL It's still against the law. 
JACK 
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start. (smiling) My advice -- smile and enjoy it. 
EXT. PORT ROYAL - MORNING 
The Jolly Mon bobs its way across the bay, dwarfed against the H.M.S. Dauntless. Will holds a stay line with iron fists. 
WILL This is either crazy, or brilliant. 
JACK Remarkable how often those two traits coincide. 
The Jolly Man nears the rudder of the much larger ship - 
EXT. H. M. S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - MORNING 
There's been a breakdown in discipline; about a dozen Navy sailors are gathered together on the main deck, playing dice. Murtogg and Mullroy among them. 
Suddenly, Jack and Will jump out, into the open - 
brandishing pistols. 
JACK Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship! 
WILL (a beat) Aye! Avast! 
Jack gives him a look, shakes his head: don't do that. 
The sailors all look   at them -- and then burst out LAUGHING. They grin,   shake their heads. Jack stands there, grinning with them --   but his gun is still level. The Lieutenant, GILLETTE,   steps forward. 
GILLETTE 
You're serious about this. 
Jack moves his pistol across, points it at Gillette. 
JACK Dead serious. 
GILLETTE You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay. 
JACK We'll see about that. 
More guffaws from the crew. A couple sailors move forward, hands on swords -- Gillette holds up a hand. 
GILLETTE Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise. 
JACK Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.

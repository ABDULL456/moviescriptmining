{"train": "Deep Rising \nDeep Rising formerly known as TENTACLE by Steven Sommers & Robert Mark Kamen extended revisions by Robert Mark Kamen Revised Draft Jan. 1st, 1996 \nOPEN TO: \nA FLASH OF LIGHTNING rips the HOLLYWOOD PICTURES LOGO away, and we find ourselves in the middle of... \n1     STORMY SEA - NIGHT                                       1 \nSUPERIMPOSED: SOUTH CHINA SEA \nThe dark blue waters roil and boil and foam. THUNDER CRACKS. LIGHTING FLASHES. \nCUT TO: \n2     UNDERWATER - NIGHT                                       2 \nAn enormous Japanese BATHYSCAPHE free-falls through the water. An autonomous fifteen-man submersible. Almost futuristic in its design. The nose cone is an amazing ultra high-pressure plexi-dome. LETTERING along the side tells us this is the \"SHINKAI 90000.\" \nCOMPUTER PRINTED across the SCREEN are the WORDS: ASSIGNMENT:\t\tGEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION. SUB-OCEANIC SEISMIC RESEARCH. TECTONIC PLATE SURVEILLANCE. ADDENDUM:\t\tABOUT TO BREAK THE WORLD'S RECORD FOR THE DEEPEST DIVE... \n3     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     3 \nThe JAPANESE CAPTAIN watches a DLD laser tracking system and barks one-word questions to his JAPANESE CREW. The Sailors work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers. The JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic position board, a contiuously-shifting graphic representation of the ocean contours below. Behind them is an elaborate DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet and dropping. The Crew works at a fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS as the depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes on the depth gauge. Several Science Officers share excited looks. \n4     ON THE DEPTH GAUGE: 35,100 -- 35,200 -- 35,300 -- 35,400...4 \nThe excitement builds. Even the Captain's weathered eyes widen. And then, as the depth gauge hits 35,801 feet below sea level, the entire Crew breaks into CHEERS, WHOOPS, HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES. \nCUT TO: \n5     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     5 \nAs it continues its descent, it passes corroding metal drums leaking toxic waste, radioactive waste, dumped in the depths, away from prying eyes, and populated areas. The vessel drops into the SULU BASIN. Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty thousand feet of water. \nBut the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon. \nDown here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm. \nThe dual TURBO-PROPS on the ear of the submersible KICK ON. The Bathysaphe is now mobile. It glides down the side of an enormous rock face, carefully avoiding massive sandstone pinnacles which jut up from the ocean floor far below. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n6     DEEP SEA - NIGHT                                         6 \nTHE SHINKAI hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate. A ROBOTIC ARM extends out from under the plexi-dome. Its \"hand\" is a high-tech LASER CUTTER. It approaches the plate, steadies, then fires a direct BLUE BEAM at the bedrock, burns the rock into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern. \nAnother ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward, its CLAW rips out the cut rock from inside the pattern, then takes the sample and sets it inside a hydro-basket on the submersible's port side. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n7     MINDINAO DEEP - NIGHT                                    7 \nA desolate, barren, spooky place. Nothing breathes. Nothing lives. Or so it would appear. The creepy, foreboding MUSICAL SCORE tells us otherwise. The Shinkai ENTERS a huge ROCK FISSURE. \nCUT TO: \n8     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     8 \nThe Captain and the Science Officers stare through the plexi dome and out into the freezing, cobalt blue of the PALAWAN TROUGH. The MUSIC intensifies as they round each curve. Then, dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half-blocked by a rock-encrusted embankment. \nThe MUSIC builds. \nThe Shinkai approaches the embankment. Slowly starts to glide up the side. The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized by all the lonely creepiness. They crest the embankment. And the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror. \nAs far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is filled with WHALE BONES. A valley of death. Cluttered here and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of several ships. Seemingly ripped apart. Clusters of shark cartilage float through the water like white ghosts. \nThe Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them. \nCUT TO: \n9     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     9 \nThe vessel cruises through the valley of death. Everyone is nervously taking readings, making calculations and adjusting equipment. \nGone is the excitement and euphoria of the record breaking. \nPANTUCCI (singing) \" -- if not for the courage of the fearless crew -- \" \nHe tugs at the wires. \nPANTUCCI (CONT'D) \" -- the Minnow would be lost, the Minowwww would be lost.\" \nFinnegan's voice explodes through his headset... \nFINNEGAN (V.O.) (radio filtered) PANTUCCI!! \nUnperturbed, Pantucci works at the wires. \nPANTUCCI (into radio) Can we use our indoor voice please... \nFINNEGAN (V.O.) (radio filtered) I'm flying blind here God damn it! \nPantucci pulls two wires from the tangle. \nPANTUCCI You trying to make me feel guilty? \nHe begins to strip the wires with his teeth. \nCUT TO: \n17     PILOT HOUSE - SUNSET                                    17 \nFinnegan peers out of the windscreen, trying to see ahead of himself. \nFINNEGAN Guilty will be the least of what you feel when I run my rig into one of these god damn no name islands! Get me well here! \nCUT TO: \n18     ENGINE ROOM                                             18 \nPantucci twists one wire around another. \nPANTUCCI All better... \n19     PILOT HOUSE - SUNSET                                    19 \nThe console lights up. The screens come back on line. \nFinnegan is pleased. \nPANTUCCI (V.O.) Now tell me again... \nCUT TO: \n20     ENGINE ROOM                                             20 \nPantucci works his wrench around an engine mount. And his nervous eyes around six men, big, bad men, standing on the far side of the engines out in a narrow passage. \nA Maori(VIVO). Two Aussies(MASON and MULLIGAN). A Samoan(MAMOOLI). A Chinese(CHIN). And an Aborigine (BILLY). Tattooed, armed to the teeth, packed in Kevlar body armor. Mercenaries. Who would as soon wring your neck as shake your hand. And a sixth man. HANOVER. The obvious leader. Smoother than the rest, but still showing the edge of a man risen from their ranks. He consults his watch with a growing concern. \nPANTUCCI ...why we took this job? \nCUT TO: \n21     PILOT HOUSE - SUNSET                                    21 \nFinnegan hits a button on his console. The Stones are replaced by the first chords of LAYLA. \nFINNEGAN If I told you once...I told you a thousand times... \nCUT TO: \n22     ENGINE ROOM                                             22 \nPANTUCCI (rote) I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care... (nervous) Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried... \nPantucci notices Hanover impatiently looking at his watch again, and nods for a mass of Aussie mean and muscle named MASON to follow him up a ladder. \nPANTUCCI (CONT'D) ...and some of it's coming your way. \nHe quickly pulls out a wrench, slaps it over a bolt and tightens it down. The leak stops. He blows on the WRENCH like it's a six-shooter, then spins it at the speed of light and holsters it into his toolbelt. \nCUT TO: \n26     FUJI MARU DECK - NIGHT                                  26 \nA group of tony British passengers is shooting skeet. Being night, the CLAY PIGEONS are glow-in-the-dark. They EXPLODE over the WATERSPORTS PLATFORM, where TWO JET SKIS swing from harnesses, and TWO SPEEDBOATS are being hoisted up the side. \nCUT TO: \n27     CRYSTAL POOL DECK - NIGHT                               27 \nRigged for a formal party. Chinese lanterns sway in the breeze. A band plays. Hundreds of wealthy Passengers, the men in tuxedos, the women in drop dead gowns, dripping with jewelry, dance, flirt, gossip, as an endless stream of waiters ply the floor with champagne laden trays. CLOSE ON: The sexiest pair of spiked heels ever to grace the foot of a woman, stopping at the top of the deck. PAN UP: A shimmering golden gown, high slit on the sides to reveal a perfect set of legs, a runway model's body, a cover girl's face...and a thief's sharp ferret eyes. TRILLIAN. A class act from top to bottom. A head turner for either sex, and knows it. She holds an orchid in her hand. Trillian scans the crowd, looking for her prey...and finds him. Her POV. The Ship's smug Captain. JEAN BAPTISTE DELCROIX. She fixes the orchid in her hair just so, about to move... \nOLD WOMAN He said an orchid and a beautiful woman belonged together... It was our first date. \nTrillian looks down to a petite old woman, dressed impeccably, delicate, frail, her beauty long faded except from her eyes. Kindness becomes her, like moonlight does the night. \nOLD WOMAN (CONT'D) He said that it was the orchid I wore that made him fall in love with me... \nTRILLIAN He sounds like a real gentleman. \nOLD WOMAN The best of the best he was... This cruise was supposed to be our 60th anniversary gift to each other. He died last Spring... \nTRILLIAN I'm so sorry... \nOLD WOMAN I was going to wear one...special for him...like a memory... \nThe Old Woman looks at the orchid. And then at Trillian. \nOLD WOMAN (CONT'D) But without him here I don't know why I should. \nTrillian takes the orchid from her hair, and places it in the lapel of the woman's jacket. \nTRILLIAN Because an orchid and a beautiful woman belong together. \nThe smile Trillian bestows on the old woman is loving, sincere. The moment between them is broken by the keen clear sound of a silver spoon tapping a crystal champagne flute. \nCANTON (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen... \nANGLE ON: The deck where the band stops playing. Voices hush. Everyone turns to NIGEL CANTON, 65, tall, elegant, every white hair perfectly in place, impeccably turned out, with the energy, and enthusiasm of a man half his age. Canton stands at the head of the pool, in front of a wall sized aquarium, flanked by his Captain. \nCANTON (CONT'D) All my life I had the dream of building the greatest pleasure ship ever to sail the seven seas... tonight, seeing all of you here...so elegant...so beautiful...so rich... \nThe crowd roars with laughter. \nCANTON (CONT'D) I realize my dream has come true...I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for making it so... \nCanton lifts his glass. \nCANTON (CONT'D) To the Fuji Maru! Good times forever! \nCROWD Forever!! Here! Here! \nThe crowd swells around Canton. ANGLE ON: The Captain chatting up some passengers when a woman's voice, seductive, beguiling, turns his head to... \nTRILLIAN (French) Is it true what they say about a captain and his boat. \nThe Captain's libido rises as he gazes into Trillian's come hither eyes. \nCAPTAIN Is what true madame? \nTrillian takes one step closer, until her moist lips are pursed inches from the captain's. \nTRILLIAN (French) Madamoiselle...that the bigger the boat...the bigger the man... \nHis breath catches. \nCAPTAIN It is a theory I would be glad to put to the test. \nTrillian draws even closer. If looks could cause a man to climax. \nTRILLIAN (French) In school, the Sisters said testing was my specialty. \nPASSENGER Captain... \nDriven to distraction, The Captain turns his attention for a moment to a passenger introducing his wife. \nPASSENGER (CONT'D) My wife... \nCAPTAIN Enchante... \nCUT TO: \n59     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     59 \nMayhem... Fire spews out of the engines. Pantucci sprays a fire extinguisher frantically. Where the shrapnel entered the hull water now spurts with every wave. Smoke and water, oil and fire. \nPANTUCCI Jezebel's dead...Hercules is right behind her! We got a gusher in the hull! \nCUT TO: \n60     PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                                     60 \nAs the Saipan comes to a halt, Finnegan loses play in his remaining stick. \nFINNEGAN Shit!! \nFinnegan locks the sticks down, and runs out. \nCUT TO: \n61     HOLD - NIGHT                                            61 \nTRACK WITH Finnegan running through the smoke filled hold, past Hanover and the merc's who are pulling themselves off the floor, right into the... \nENGINE ROOM. Where Pantucci is beside himself in smoke and sputtering flame. \nPANTUCCI What did you do to my kids!! \nFINNEGAN Me?? \nPANTUCCI No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing? \nFinnegan notices something on the floor. He picks up a shard of the speedboat propeller. Strange. Hanover steps into the room. \nHANOVER What happened? \nFinnegan looks at the piece of speedboat in his hand. \nFINNEGAN We ran into a speedboat... \nHe shows the piece of speed boat to Hanover. Who stares at it. Finnegan sees the hint of recognition in his eyes. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Speedboat in the middle of the ocean... \nHANOVER How soon can we get up and running? \nFINNEGAN We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly. \nHANOVER I have a schedule... \nPANTUCCI I spent two years building these things...screw your schedule! \nMason grabs Pantucci by the throat, lifting him off the ground. \nMASON You little weasel! \nFinnegan slams the piece of speed boat into the back of Mason's knees buckling him to the floor. In the blink of an eye there is the barrel of a .45 pressed hard against his head, Hanover at the trigger end. \nHANOVER We were talking about my schedule... \nFINNEGAN You're going to have to get a new one. \nHANOVER Not an option. \nFINNEGAN Then you better start swimming. \nHanover cracks Finnegan across the face with the barrel of the gun. Finnegan's head spins. He touches the corner of his mouth, and comes away with blood, and a look of murder in his eyes. Hanover slams a round in the chamber. \nHANOVER One more joke and your comedy career is over. Now fix this. \nPANTUCCI With what? Look at them...they need gears...cylinder heads...oil pans... we're in the middle of the goddamn ocean... \nFINNEGAN I think he knows that Joey. \nPANTUCCI Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need... \nMulligan comes running in. \nA thick black hose weaves it's way across the flooded floor, sucking water. Leila up to her knees in water, wearing a blast visor, stripped down to her skivvies, wields a welder against the gaping hole in the hull. As the boat dips in the waves water sloshes in. Billy sits on the stairs trying to stay dry. He goes to light a cigarette. \nLEILA (angry) Kwan bat! Kwam bat! Booom!! \nShe points the acetalyne tank she works with. \nBILLY (bothered) Yeah...yeah...yeah... \nBilly heads for the deck. Leila looks after him in disgust. \nLEILA Asshole... \nShe ignites her torch, is about to flick her visor down again when a loud gurgling, a sucking sound, stops her. She cuts the torch. Looks around nervously...and then she spots the suction hose sucking away. \nShe smiles to herself. Flips the visor, fires the torch, and goes back to work. \nCUT TO: \n66     FUJI MARU DECK PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                       66 \nAn alert Mulligan leads Finnegan and Pantucci around a corner. Vivo brings up the rear. \nPANTUCCI You'd think they'd set a deck watch... \nFLASH TO: The deck full of people partying, carousing. The railing is lined with 15 lifeboats suspended in their harnesses. \nFLASH BACK TO: Mulligan, Finnegan, Pantucci and Vivo staring at a completely deserted deck. The lifeboat harnesses swing in the breeze, eerily empty. Mulligan looks back to Vivo. \nMULLIGAN I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through. \nVIVO Maybe plans changed... \nMULLIGAN Plans don't change... \nPANTUCCI Maybe it's the wrong ship. \nMULLIGAN Shut up! \nAnd then a strange yowl echoes from somewhere deep in the bowels of the ship. Finnegan and Pantucci trade a look. \nFINNEGAN Let's just keep going. \nMULLIGAN (nervous) You ain't giving the orders here! \nAnd again the yowl. Everyone freezes. \nMULLIGAN (CONT'D) Let's keep going! \nCUT TO: \n67     CRYSTAL POOL DECK - NIGHT                               67 \nHanover, Mason, and Chin set foot on the deserted pool deck. \nFLASH TO: The pool deck is jammed with people partying. The band playing. Two kids toss a beach ball back and forth. The ball flies over one boy's head... \nFLASH BACK TO: The ball falls into the empty pool...Where the band's instruments litter the bottom along a big jagged crack. \nMASON What the... \nUneasy, Hanover and his men look around at the over turned chairs. The smashed aquarium. Chin bends down and picks up a small squid from the bottom of the smashed aquarium. The squid wraps its tentacles around Chin's hand almost immediately. Chin regards it with curiosity. \nHANOVER Focus on the task Mr. Chin... \n...and then the yowl freezes them. C.U. on Hanover's face. His eyes flicker with uncertainty...and a tinge of fear. \nCUT TO: \n68     GRAND ATRIUM LOBBY - NIGHT                              68 \nDING! FLASH TO: A glass elevator descending through the spectacular atrium, full of elegant well-dressed people laughing, chatting. \nDING! FLASH BACK TO: Mulligan, Vivo, Pantucci, and Finnegan, standing amidst the shattered glass and broken furniture, whirling to the elevator door opening. Mulligan, nerves ajangle, and Vivo, swing their pulse rifles up hard as the door opens to reveal...and empty elevator! DING! The door closes. The car starts to ascend in the eerie silence. The mercs watch it go with growing uneasiness. \nCUT TO: \n69     FUJI MARU BRIDGE - DAWN                                 69 \nStill silence. Cautious, she taps on the wall. For a moment nothing. And then... \nWHAMM!! \nSomething slams against the wall from the other side in response. Trillian falls back against the door, her heart in her throat. \nCUT TO: \n75     ENGINE CHAMBERS - DAY                                   75 \nA MAZE of pipes, hoses, gears, engines and catwalks. THINGS are HISSING, HUMMING, RUMBLING and CLANKING. A spooky place. Dark. Damp. Eerie. Ominous. Mulligan and Vivo, looking more nervous by the moment, lead the way. Finnegan and Pantucci follow. \nPANTUCCI (rattling, nervous) You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life... \nFINNEGAN (calm) Joey... \nPANTUCCI ...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games... \nFinnegan turns to Pantucci, his voice even, calm, almost kind. \nFINNEGAN Joey...it's okay... \nPANTUCCI What? You don't think I can have a normal life? \nFINNEGAN Joey...look at me... \nHe forces Pantucci to look him in the eyes. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) We're gonna get what we gotta get... do what we gotta do...and get the hell outta here...okay? \nPantucci draws his strength from Finnegan. He forces himself to take a deep breath. \nPANTUCCI Okay... \nSuddenly, overhead, something black and veiny skitters across the mass of pipes, so fast it shocks Pantucci back into the wall. \nMULLIGAN What the...??? \nHe and Vivo spin their guns at the pipes. The red dots of their laser sights sweep the shadowy web of metal. Nothing. \nMULLIGAN (CONT'D) Come on...the sooner we get outta here the better I'll feel. Mulligan and Vivo move forward. \nPANTUCCI (quiet) Finnegan... \nFinnegan turns to Pantucci, who has not moved from where he hit the wall. \nFINNEGAN It's okay...come on... \nPANTUCCI (scared) I'm stuck... \nPantucci tries to pull away from the wall. He is stuck. \nMULLIGAN (jumpy) Hey! What are you trying to pull! \nPANTUCCI (pleading) John... \nFinnegan takes Pantucci by the front of his shirt, ignoring Mulligan. \nFINNEGAN Relax your arms...slowly...that's it... \nAs Finnegan pulls, Pantucci does as he is told. He slips away from the wall. The jacket doesn't. \nMULLIGAN What the... \nHe reaches out to touch the wall. Finnegan grabs his wrist, grabs a flashlight from Vivo's utility belt and shines it on the wall. Their POV -- the entire wall is covered in a strange, yellow, secreted GELATIN. Laid on in some sort of weird, inhuman, geometric pattern. Like a spider web. \nCUT TO: \n76     THE SAIPAN'S HOLD - DAY                                 76 \nLeila has welded half the hole shut. A GUSH OF WATER suddenly pours through the other half. Leila cuts the torch. \nLEILA Gebop!! \nThe KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK of the PUMP is like a loud scary HEARTBEAT. Leila removes her blast visor. Wipes her brow. \n-- A MANGLED CORPSE GUSHES IN through the gaping hole! \nFinnegan and Pantucci stop working. All eyes are focused on the maze of pipes. THINGS are HISSING, HUMMING and RUMBLING. Nothing moves. \nMULLIGAN Check it out! \nVIVO Hey! You hear me? Come out! Still no response. \nMULLIGAN Will you check it the hell out!! \nDisgusted, Vivo puts his feet in the water, gingerly. \nVIVO Man this shit is cold! \nHe walks toward the mass of hissing pipes. His pulse rifle rising. \nVIVO (CONT'D) I'm gonna kick your ass for putting me through this... \nThen he hears a strange SLURPING and SUCKING SOUND coming from behind some gears at the end of a little alleyway. \nVIVO (CONT'D) I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water. \nMULLIGAN What is it man? \nVIVO I'm looking... \nVivo slowly goes in for a closer look, gun out front, heading down the little alleyway. He looks behind some pipes. The SLURPING gets LOUDER. Then he sees it. His eyes widen -- \nVIVO (CONT'D) On shit! \nAnd that's the last thing he ever says. Because just then, from a dark area between the pipes, SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT! \nMulligan, Finnegan, and Pantucci stare in horrified amazement as Vivo is viciously YANKED into the pipes. A moment later a WASH OF BLOOD is FLUNG across a wall. Mulligan freaks out, aims his rifle at the pipes. \nMULLIGAN Vivo!! Vivo!! \nAs Mulligan's attention diverts, Finnegan instinctively heads for Vivo's rifle, lying on the floor. Mulligan swings around. KACHUNK!! His rifle is armed. The laser dot fixes on Finnegan's forehead. \nMULLIGAN (CONT'D) Touch it and you're dead, asshole! \nFinnegan freezes, looking up at a very freaked out Mulligan. \nPANTUCCI Don't shoot, man, don't shoot! \nMULLIGAN What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo? \nEverybody's breathing hard. Freaked out. Major tension. Blood drips down the wall. \nCUT TO: \n80     VAULT ROOM - NIGHT                                      80 \nTrillian steps up to the vault, looking around, a bit nervous, something is definitely not right here. \nTRILLIAN Helloooo? \nShe shrugs, must be her imagination. From inside her low cut dress she pulls the Captain's gold security card. She is about to run it through the reader slot when... \nV.O. \nAhem... She spins to...Hanover, Mason, Mamooli and Chin. Looking grim. \nTRILLIAN (recovering) I'm sorry... This area is for authorized personnel only. As the assistant to the Purser, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to vacate... \nMason and Chin lift their pulse-rifles. KACHUNK!! \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) Or maybe not. \nHANOVER Where is everybody? \nTrillian is confused -- \nTRILLIAN What do you mean? \nHanover steps forward, right in her face. \nHANOVER (threatening) I mean...where is everybody? \nTRILLIAN Poolside? \nHANOVER (CONT'D) Where are you going? \nTRILLIAN (freezing) Nowhere... \nFINNEGAN Hanover, listen... \nHANOVER Shut up! \nHanover hit the elevator button. The elevator starts to rise. \nHANOVER (CONT'D) Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo? \nFINNEGAN I told you... \nPANTUCCI Man, there's something here! On the boat! \nCANTON You see? You see? \nHANOVER Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job... \nFINNEGAN Did you clear this? \nHANOVER With who? \nAll of a sudden, the car is jerked to a halt, as if some giant hand was yanking on the cable. \nFINNEGAN With that... \nAnd then, the elevator jerks down again. And up. Everyone is thrown about like straw. Everyone is shouting, panicked. And then the jerking stops...and the sound of sucking surrounds the car. The cable starts twisting, creaking sickeningly above their heads. \nPANTUCCI It's gonna snap the cable! \nTrillian starts hitting the buttons frantically. \nTRILLIAN Open! Open! God damn it!! \nFinnegan is at the doors, pulling them with all his might. \nFINNEGAN Help me!! \nPantucci, then Mamooli, then Hanover and Chin pull at the doors as Trillian keeps hitting the buttons. The doors part a bit. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) They're coming! They're coming! \nThe doors fly open to...a solid wall. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Oh shit... \nAnd silence...until the doors slam shut...the cable snaps...and the car plummets! Screaming and shouting mixes with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame against the shaft. Finnegan's eyes go to the floor indicator. \nAn AUTOMATED VOICE rapidly CALLS OUT right along with it -- \nVOICE 4th floor. 3rd floor. 2nd floor. 1st floor... \nDown, down, down it goes. Faster and faster. But the elevator doesn't stop at the first floor. It keeps dropping. The FLOOR INDICATOR BLINKS: \"SUBLEVEL. SUBLEVEL. SUBLEVEL.\" \nCANTON It's taking us to the bottom of the ship! \nFINNEGAN HANG ON! \nCABLES SNAP. METAL SCREAMS. The ELEVATOR starts to BUCKLE. Which is actually good, because it's getting jammed sideways in the shaft which slows it down. The it HITS bottom with a resounding crash. \nCUT TO: \n85     SUBLEVEL LOBBY - DAY                                    85 \nThe DOORS BLOW OUT into the darkened hallway. For a long moment nothing moves, then Finnegan tumbles out of the elevator. Rising painfully. One after another the others exit into the dark lobby. \nHANOVER Where are we? \nCANTON The sublevel lobby. \nFinnegan bends down to pick up one of the pulse rifles. \nHANOVER Don't touch it! \nFinnegan looks up to Hanover standing a bit shakily, his own rifle trained on Finnegan. \nCAPTAIN He's the owner... \nFINNEGAN Why don't you want a message sent? \nCANTON I just think that... \nFINNEGAN Because you know a message can't be sent... \nThere is a moment of silence. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) You're the inside guy aren't you? The guy who knocked out the communications. \nHanover sets Mason's pulse-rifle down and claps his hands. \nHANOVER Bravo. \nCanton flashes Hanover a look. The Captain is confused. Trillian suddenly GRABS CANTON, spins him around and SLAMS him against the hull. \nTRILLIAN How the hell do we fix it?! \nA tense moment as Canton debates his situation, then relents. \nCANTON You can't... All the systems were melted at their core by nitric acid... \nCAPTAIN (confused) This was your life's work...your dreams... \nCANTON My dreams cost more than they would make...I miscalculated the market... there was no way I could recoup... \nFINNEGAN Unless you collected on the insurance... \nTRILLIAN What are you people talking about? \nFINNEGAN He's with them. \nHe motions to the mercenaries. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) They rob the joint blind and torpedo it to the bottom. He collects the insurance, and sails off into the sunset clean as a whistle. \nFinnegan fixes Hanover with a look of certainty. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Right? \nThe Captain blows. He leaps on Canton. His hands find the older man's throat. \nCAPTAIN All these people dead!! Because you screwed up on the math?? \nFinnegan pulls the Captain off. \nFINNEGAN It's not going to help us! \nCAPTAIN We're going to die here! We're going to die! \nFinnegan holds the Captain with both hands, calming him. \nFINNEGAN I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up? \nTRILLIAN (alarmed) You hear that? \nUnseen by anyone, there is MOVEMENT within the MACHINERY. The walls start to come alive with dark, SHADOWY IMPRESSIONS. HIDDEN within the maze of machinery, OBSCURED by the bad lighting, glistening abominations slither over pipes, squirm through gears, and undulate in and out of crevices and holes. The room is becoming a living, throbbing, pulsating horror. \nCAPTAIN They are...they are everywhere. \nFINNEGAN All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves. \nEverybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch. Then a loud GURGLING is HEARD. Everybody looks up at the ceiling. \nHidden within the girders, and sticking to them, a large translucent INTESTINE-like thing CROSSES the ceiling. Inside it are strange, disgusting biological workings. The GURGLING suddenly gets dramatically LOUDER. And then we SEE BILLY and LEILA, being sucked down the entire length of the fatty intestine. Still alive. And squirming wildly. EVERYBODY freaks out and HAULS ASS for the hatch. Finnegan and Hanover OPEN FIRE. Covering their asses. \nCUT TO: \n89     ENGINE CHAMBERS - NIGHT                                 89 \nEverybody pours out of the machine shop and fans out into this mechanical MAZE. The engine chambers are a labyrinth of pipe-lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks and pillars of steel. The LIGHTING is very poor, very dark. \nHanover, Pantucci, Chin and Mamooli OPEN UP. FIRING blindly and wildly at anything and everything that seems to move in the darkness. The MUZZLE FLASHES and TRACER FIRE light up the chambers in a sort of surreal horror tableau. We catch more ABSTRACT GLIMPSES of the translucent TENTACLE-SACS, strange FEELERS, groping SUCKERS, SLIME and VEINS. \nCUT TO: \nTRILLIAN Takes one to know one. \nSNAP!! A TENTACLE SHOOTS OUT between Finnegan and Trillian. Just missing them as it SLAMS into a wall. \nFinnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed. Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt. Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks -- \nThe TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach. Trying to find its prey. Finnegan is frozen in place. Watching. Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees -- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up and down the Tentacle. WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling their way across the wall. Getting closer and closer to Finnegan. \nFinnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's feet. He motions for her to push it toward him. But, frozen in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her. Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall. FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head. Then he BRUSHES against some dirt, making a SCRAPING SOUND. \nA Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm. He leaps to his feet. So does Trillian. She grabs the rifle, turns and bolts off down the dark alley. Finnegan tries to run, but the Feelers hold him tight. Two more Feelers slap onto his arm. HE YELLS. \nThe Creature starts reeling him in. \nANGLE ON: Trillian, running. Finnegan's YELL reaches her. She stops cold. Looking back the way she came, torn. \nANGLE ON: Finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle. When...out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running back. Panting hard, she aims the gun. \nFINNEGAN Shoot it! Shoot it! \nSpurred to action, Trillian jams the rifle barrel against the tentacle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) The safety! The safety! \nTrillian frantically fumbles around, looking for the right lever on the complicated, sophisticated weapon, trying to find it. \nTRILLIAN I don't know where it is! \nFINNEGAN On the side!! \nDesperate, unable to find it, she does the next best thing...she swings her rifle like it's a baseball bat. SMACKS the TENTACLE. HARD. RIPPING into its flesh. It SQUIRTS ink blood, releases Finnegan and recoils. \nFinnegan drops to his knees. Grabbing his arm, in pain. The tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again. Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to his feet, and starts to drag him backward. The tentacle coils, ready to strike. Just before it does so, Finnegan grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Let's get the hell out of here! \nFinnegan staggers to his feet. He and Trillian run off. \nCUT TO: \n91     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     91 \nTrillian and Finnegan come running around a corner, and stop to catch their breath. \nFINNEGAN (annoyed) The safety...the safety... He flicks the safety on and off. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Got it? \nTRILLIAN (pissed) Hey! I didn't have to come back. \nFINNEGAN Yeah you did... \nTRILLIAN (defensive) Right... You have a boat. \nFINNEGAN Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal. \nTRILLIAN Oh yeah? What kind is that? \nFINNEGAN The \"come back\" kind. \nTRILLIAN How do you know that? \nFINNEGAN Takes one to know one. \nFinnegan's small smile makes Trillian acutely uncomfortable. \nV.O. HEELLPP!! \nCUT TO: \n92     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     92 \nThe Captain is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web. Struggling, frantic. But the more he struggles, the more enmeshed he gets. He holds his hands out beseechingly to Canton, who stands looking at him in terror. \nCAPTAIN Help me! \nBut Canton does not move. All of a sudden Canton sees something deep in the web, behind the Captain, which makes his blood freeze. \nHANOVER (CONT'D) (whispered) ...he's a bloody taxi driver! \nChin breaks for the catwalk, hurrying after Finnegan. Hanover stands with a very antsy Mamooli, steaming. After a long moment, he strides off after Finnegan as well. \nCUT TO: \n93     BALLAST PASSAGEWAY - DAY                                93 \nIn SLOW-MO, Finnegan and the others creep down a darkened, pipe-lined passageway. Guns out front. Sight beams sweeping the path ahead. Eyes wide open. Sweat sliding down their faces. Breath coming in short nervous bursts. Hearts pounding out of chests. \nThe ominous MUSICAL SCORE adds to the tension. \nThen the EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON. A creepy-looking reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship. Finnegan continues on. Followed by the others. All sweating hard. Eyes nervously shifting. Fear thick in the air. \nLOOKING DOWN THROUGH A METAL GATE, we SEE Finnegan, Trillian and the others passing below. Then suddenly, in the dark foreground -- SOMETHING WET WRIGGLES across the gate. They come to a door. Finnegan tries the handle. No go. Finnegan turns to Canton, and mimes for keys. Canton shakes his head. He has none. \nHANOVER (whispered) Very good Finnegan...very good. \nTrillian moves up to Finnegan. She reaches into her hair, and pulls out her trusty lockpick. As he watches, somewhat mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times, and depresses the handle. Click! The door opens. Finnegan looks at her curiously, but with respect. \nCUT TO: \n94     BALLAST SECTION - DAY                                   94 \nThey ENTER the rear ballast section, where the walls are indeed far apart, half of which is now a small POND. Obviously flooded. The only way out of this room is down some STEPS which VANISH beneath the seawater, or through a single violently twisted HATCH DOOR. \nFinnegan tries to push the hatch. It will not give. \nMamooli and Chin join him, adding their considerable muscle to the task. The hatch holds tight. Finnegan turns to Canton, who stands slumped against a railing. He does not look well at all. \nFINNEGAN What's on the far side? \nCANTON I don't know. \nPANTUCCI (nerves) It's your damn ship! What the hell do you mean you don't know? \nFinnegan touches Pantucci's shoulder. \nFINNEGAN Joey, what difference does it make... \nFinnegan enters the water. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) If you hear one shot, you know I made it...start coming... \nPantucci follows Finnegan to the water. \nHANOVER How do we know you're going to signal...how do we know you're not going to just take off? \nFinnegan stops. \nFINNEGAN I'll wait here... You go check it out. \nHanover does not move. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) (contemptuous) I didn't think so. \nFinnegan wades into the water. Just before he sinks beneath the surface... \nTRILLIAN Finnegan... \nHe looks back. \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) Be careful. \nWith a smile, Finnegan dives under. Pantucci right behind him. The others stand looking around, nervous. \nCUT TO: \n95     UNDERWATER - NIGHT                                      95 \nFinnegan SWIMS down to the floor of the ballast. Then into a passageway lined with black pipes. Pantucci right behind him. STRANGE NOISES REVERBERATE through the MURKY waters. \nCREAKS and MOANS. Spooky shit. Both men are wide-eyed as they swim. Weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts. The THINGS could come out of almost anywhere. Bubbles drift up from the darkness below. \nThe MUSIC IS TENSE...VERY VERY TENSE. Pantucci falls behind. He swims around a curve and right into a SEVERED HUMAN ARM! AIR BUBBLES BLAST out of his mouth as he SCREAMS. The fingers on the dead hand seem to reach out for him. He fights his way past and swims off in a panic. \nCUT TO: \nPANTUCCI I ain't goin' up no more elevators. \nCANTON There's stairways... \nMamooli SLAMS the HATCH SHUT. Eyes bugging out of his head. \nMAMOOLI I say we stay right here! \nPANTUCCI Are you crazy? \nMAMOOLI (desperate) There's plenty of food here. We can hold out...someone'll rescue us... \nFINNEGAN Who? \nMAMOOLI Someone...maybe they sent an SOS! \nPANTUCCI On what? This son of a bitch (to Canton) zapped the communications. \nHANOVER Mamooli stand down! \nMAMOOLI We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy! \nFINNEGAN Boat or no boat...I'm going... \nFinnegan steps forward. Mamooli aims his rifle right at Finnegan's head. \nMAMOOLI They're wipin' us out one at a time. I say we make a stand. Right here! Right now! Maximum firepower! \nPANTUCCI Somebody shoot this jerk! \nFINNEGAN (calm) Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch! \nMAMOOLI I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here! \nFinnegan freezes. CLOSE ON: The hatch. As a BLACK LIQUID starts to OOZE through a tiny latch-hole. No one sees it. \nFINNEGAN I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish. \nMAMOOLI What the hell are you talking about? \nFINNEGAN Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish. \nThe LIQUID SHADOW OOZES down and hits the floor, starts to EXPAND, filling like a water balloon. It's not a liquid. It's a Tentacle. VEINS, FEELERS and SUCKERS begin to form. \nMAMOOLI And what? These things are octopuses \nFINNEGAN I don't know what these things are ...all I know is... \nThe TENTACLE slowly RISES UP right behind Mamooli. Inches behind his head. Finnegan and Hanover see it. Eyes widening. \nMAMOOLI What...? What?? \nMamooli turns to the tentacle looming over him, about to strike. \nMAMOOLI (CONT'D) EEEEYYYYYAAAAHHHH!!!! \nHe opens fire, emptying his clip into the tentacle. The tentacle retreats into the pipes. Mamooli looks around. The room is empty. He runs out. \nCUT TO: \n101     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                     101 \nMamooli rushes into the empty passageway, looks left. Then right. His POV. Down the hall another TENTACLE comes racing at him. Mamooli panics, drops his rifle. \nTRACK WITH Mamooli racing down the hallway, looking over his shoulder in fear, as the tentacle comes racing after him...gaining...gaining... almost on him... Mamooli leaps through an open hatch, and swings it shut in one swift motion. The tentacle slams into the glass portal. Stopped. Mamooli keeps his eye on the portal, and backs up two steps. He lets out a long deep breath of relief, turns... WHAM!!! Another tentacle envelops his face! \nMAMOOLI EEEYYYAAAHHHH!!!!! \nCUT TO: \n102     MECHANICAL CHAMBER - NIGHT                             102 \nDante's Inferno: STEAM, SMOKE, FIRE, STRANGE NOISES, DARK AREAS, and lots of MOVING ENGINE PARTS. \nFinnegan leads, followed by Trillian, Hanover, Pantucci, and Canton. We can HEAR their HEARTS BEATING. Scary shit. Finnegan heads for a open HATCH. It suddenly SLAMS SHUT. He instantly VEERS down another passageway. \nPANTUCCI What the hell is going on!! \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) Finnegan...do something!! Please!! \nFinnegan looks around and spots the place in the ceiling where most of the Tentacles are coming from. Their long TAILS WIGGLE down from a massive clutter of pipes. A bas-relief of horror. Finnegan reaches over and yanks two thermite grenades off Hanover's utility belt. \nHANOVER Finnegan, No!!! \n...bites the pins and spits them out. \nFINNEGAN Eat this. \nHe chucks the grenades up into the strange WRITHING FRESCO, safely clear of the passengers. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) FIRE IN THE HOLE! \nPantucci and Hanover throw themselves to the floor. Finnegan pulls Trillian down, covering her. \nBA-WOOM! GELATIN SPRAYS EVERYWHERE. \nCUT TO: \n105     FUJI MARU - SAME TIME                                  105 \nA loud, creepy, suction-like SOUND is HEARD, that strange pitter- patter of little feet running across the hull. Then the HULL begins to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE. \nCUT TO: \n106     MID HULL - NIGHT                                       106 \nAll the MOVEMENT STOPS. The remaining TENTACLES VANISH into the machinery. Pantucci, and Hanover look up from the floor, covered in slime. Finnegan and Trillian also look up...and then look at each other face to face...inches apart. Dripping with slime. \nFINNEGAN Looking good... \nTRILLIAN You should talk... \nThen the machinery shuts down. The engines go dead. ALL SOUND CUTS OUT. An expectant hush. Somewhere, WATER DRIPS... \nWE GO EXTREMELY CLOSE ON Trillian's EYES. Pantucci's EYES. Hanover's EYES. Finnegan's EYES. The air is riddled with ominous expectation. And that's when the HULL BEGINS TO TORQUE. RIVETS POP and SNAP. WATER SPRAYS. METAL BUCKLES. \n107     SHOT:                                                  107 \nAt the far end of the ship, part of the LOWER BOW RIPS OPEN! AND A WALL OF WATER RUSHES IN. FLOOD CITY! Finnegan's eyes widen as he sees (MODEL SHOT) the massive WAVE OF WATER CRASHING TOWARDS THEM. RIPPING OUT PIPES, DUCTS, WALLS, EQUIPMENT and EVERYTHING in front of it. \nFINNEGAN GO! GO! GO! \nThey all hightail it for hatches. Finnegan and Trillian make it into one hatch. Hanover and Pantucci make it into another. WATER CRASHES and SPRAYS behind them. \nCUT TO: \n108     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      108 \nMassive AIR BUBBLES EXPLODE out from under the bow. \nCUT TO: \n109     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      109 \nRED WARNING LIGHTS FLASH up and down every passageway. And a CLAXTON RINGS, in accelerating tones, giving a frenetic urgency to ALL OF THE \nFOLLOWING SCENES: \n110     A PASSAGEWAY:                                          110 \nWATER BLASTS through a hatch and CHASES Finnegan and Trillian down a passageway. They jag left at an intersection -- WATER BLASTS through the hatch directly in front of them. \nFINNEGAN We're going to sink! We've got to get on deck! \nThey backtrack. Trillian's now in the lead. They HAUL ASS down a hallway. WATER ROARING IN from everywhere behind them. All of the watertight HATCHES begin to hydraulically CLOSE. Trillian and Finnegan JAG into a hatch. It's a small room. The hatch in front of them closes. WATER BLASTS in behind them. SWEEPS them off their feet. The ROOM quickly starts to FILL UP. Trillian pulls frantically at the hatch. \nCUT TO: \n111     NARROW PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                              111 \nHanover and Pantucci quickly slog their way through knee-high water. Pantucci stumbles into the water, frantically scrambles up. He looks back -- UNDER THE WATER, INKY FORMS hurl themselves down the passageway right towards him. Pantucci YELPS, and splashes away. \nCUT TO: \n112     SUBMERGING ROOM - NIGHT                                112 \n117     FUJI MARU REAR DECK - DAY                              117 \nThe Saipan is still bobbing behind the Fuji Maru. But the HARPOON HOOK, which holds the tow-line and is embedded into the rear deck of the ship, is starting to PRY LOOSE. It JERKS and BUCKS against the metal wall. Canton doesn't notice this as he slips and slides his way up to the railing. He sees the Saipan and smiles. Then he looks off at -- \n118     ISLAND                                                 118 \nrising out of the ocean. About a mile away. Canton starts to climb over the railing. And that's when the HARPOON HOOK RIPS FREE. WHIZZES FORWARD. And IMPALES Canton's LEG. He SCREAMS. Tries to spin free. The hook hangs onto his leg for a long, agonizing BEAT as Canton continues to SCREAM. Then the HOOK RIPS FREE, grabs the METAL RAILING and starts TEARING IT off the deck. Canton drops to the deck, holding his leg and whimpering in pain. And then he sees it -- \n119     SPEEDBOAT                                              119 \ndangling from its harness down on the watersports platform. \n120     TO SCENE                                               120 \nCanton starts to crawl for it. Moaning and bleeding. \nCUT TO: \n121     CRYSTAL POOL DECK - NIGHT                              121 \nFinnegan and Trillian race up onto the pool deck. Passing beneath a colorful NEON SIGN which READS: \n\"THE FUJI MARU - YOUR FUN SHIP\" \nIn the dark, Trillian trips. She falls to the slippery, waterlogged deck, and SCREAMS... \nTRILLIAN EEEEEYYYYYAAAAHHHH! \n...clawing at her face... Finnegan pulls her hands from her face...and the thing that attached itself there...a small squid from the shattered aquarium. \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) (freaked) Ah...ah...ah... \nTries to catch her breath. \nFINNEGAN It's OK...it's not one of them... it's from the aquarium...it's... \nAnd then it dawns on Finnegan. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) It's not them...it's it... \nTRILLIAN What? \nFINNEGAN You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this... \nHe holds up the squid. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) ...can't exert that kind of pressure... And the way it tracked us? A million little things don't carry portable phones to coordinate positions... What's chasing us... it's one...thing...one giant... thing. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n122     ARIAL POV - MATTE FX SHOT - NIGHT                      122 \n...looking down on the Fuji Maru from high up in the air. Beneath the ENTIRE SHIP is an enormous, undulating BLACK SHADOW. A massive monster from the deep. \nCUT TO: \n123     CASINO - NIGHT                                         123 \nRED WARNING LIGHTS FLASH. The CLAXTON RINGS. Off to one side of a wall, behind the bar, the dumbwaiter door opens, and Pantucci tumbles out, looks around, and then hears... \nHANOVER (V.O.) Help!! Help!! \nPantucci limps around the bar, down a row of one armed bandits... rounds a corner, comes face-to-face with Hanover. \nHanover's eyes are filled with terror and despair. His face is badly constricted. His body paralyzed. He clings to a black-jack table as a Tentacle-Sac drinks its way up his leg. It's already to his hip. He grasps desperately for his pistol, just beyond his reach on the floor. This guy ain't gonna survive. \nPANTUCCI YELPS and quickly back away, eyes wide, totally tense. He looks around, sees that there's only one Tentacle, and it's completely occupied with devouring Hanover. Pantucci is wigged, but manages to lock eyes with Hanover. Then he looks at the Sac, filled with regurgitated flesh. \nPANTUCCI ...even you don't deserve this. \nPantucci picks up Hanover's pistol. Then slowly, cautiously, he creeps forward, and sticks the gun into Hanover's TWITCHING HAND. \nPANTUCCI (CONT'D) I'm sorry man... \nHe turns and quickly limps off. Hanover's EYES look down at the gun in his hand. Then, with all the strength he has left, he slowly, painfully, turns the pistol so it points at his head. \nCLOSE ON: Hanover's trembling FINGER. As it slowly squeezes the trigger. He want to kill himself. Needs to hill himself. He squeezes harder. The TRIGGER DEPRESSES! -- CLICK! The gun is empty. Hanover's mouth opens in a horrible, silent scream. \n128     SPEEDBOAT - NIGHT                                      128 \nCanton is pinned to the hood of the speedboat, his face shredded by glass, his leg mangled, screaming as his panicked eyes watch a TENTACLE slowly squirm across the hood toward him, it's hideous feelers writhe and arch. Canton backs away from it as far as he can. \nAnother TENTACLE SQUIRMS up next to him. Canton crawls away from that one. Its Feelers and Suckers unsheathe, dripping mucus. Canton's eyes widen, horrified. Then another TENTACLE SQUIRMS up. Canton crawls to the center of the hood. And another TENTACLE. Canton has nowhere to go. The Tentacles close in on him. \nCANTON No! No! No! \nAll the tentacles rise over him, about to descend. \nCANTON (CONT'D) NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! \nCUT TO: \n129     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      129 \nFinnegan and Trillian race for all they are worth, clamber over the side of the Fuji Maru, dropping to the deck of the Saipan. \nCUT TO: \n130     SAIPAN - NIGHT                                         130 \nFinnegan and Trillian slowly clamber through the hold, waist deep in water, on edge, eyes wide, watching for any sign of trouble. It's quiet in here. Maybe too quiet. \nTRILLIAN (quietly) Finnegan... \nFINNEGAN Yeah... \nTRILLIAN ...the minute you start your engines ...it's going to kill us, isn't it? \nThey step up to one of the big CRATES. Finnegan starts SMASHING it with the butt of his pulse-rifle. The CRATE BURST OPEN. REVEALING the WARHEAD of the torpedo. Trillian is stunned. \nFINNEGAN Not unless we kill it first. \nFinnegan SMASHES more of the CRATE, it falls apart, REVEALING the entire torpedo. He hands her his pulse rifle. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Anything moves, you shoot. \nFinnegan starts to yank open the top plates of the missile head. Trillian looks around nervously. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy... \nTRILLIAN If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island? \nFINNEGAN Jet ski...there's one left up there. \nThe plate comes loose. Revealing a gaggle of wires, and parts. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) ...let's see, it was red wire cross compressor blue wire...or blue cross red? \nHe starts to fiddle with the wires. -- Suddenly, there's a LOUD SLOSHING SOUND right behind them! CRATES TOPPLE! More pulse rifles spill out. Trillian spins, ready to blast away with the pulse rifle, to... \nPANTUCCI Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!! \nFINNEGAN Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red... \nHe refers to the wires. \nPANTUCCI Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg? \nFINNEGAN Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid? \nPANTUCCI (fast) Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid? \nFINNEGAN Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast? \nPANTUCCI For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast. \nTRILLIAN How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right? \nFINNEGAN Right... \nPANTUCCI Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here? \nFINNEGAN Seafood salad. (to Trillian) You ever operate a jet ski? \nTRILLIAN (nervous) You want ME to go up there? \nPANTUCCI (CONT'D) Man, don't go up there... \nFINNEGAN One whistle... Start the engine... \nFinnegan slams shells into the shotgun. \nPANTUCCI She's gone... \nFINNEGAN Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump... \nPANTUCCI All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick? \nFINNEGAN You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey? \nFinnegan hefts a pulse rifle, and runs out of the pilothouse. \nCUT TO: \n136     FUJI MARU DECK - NIGHT                                 136 \nFinnegan drops onto the deck from the tow line. Pulse-rifle leveled. Adrenaline rushing through his veins. A man on a mission. The SHIP is in its final death throes. MOANING and CREAKING. Trillian's scream pierces the night, followed by several shots. Finnegan takes off in it's direction. \nCUT TO: \n137     FUJI MARU PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                           137 \nFinnegan ENTERS. Ready to be jumped. The scary MUSIC builds. TENSION CITY. Again shots fired. This time closer. Finnegan throws caution to the winds, and runs for all he is worth. \nCUT TO: \n138     HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        138 \nTrillian is being dragged down the dark hallway by a tentacle wrapped around her legs. She struggles frantically, trying to get a clear shot off. But her shot goes wild as she is pulled this way and that, slammed against the walls on either side. She loses her rifle. \nCUT TO: \n139     GRAND ATRIUM - NIGHT                                   139 \nFinnegan ENTERS the glass-domed atrium. Sloshes through the water. Stops in the middle and looks around. Sees a Tentacle, writhing up a glass wall of the atrium. Finnegan hears TRILLIAN SCREAM. He quickly plants his feet and FIRES from the hip. GLASS SHATTERS EVERYWHERE. He arcs around. WINDOWS BLOW TO PIECES. Finnegan lets out a low, angry, guttural YELL. The TENTACLE SHREDS from the GUNFIRE. \nCUT TO: \n140     HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        140 \nThe tentacle dragging Trillian retracts. Freed, Trillian gets up, grabs her rifle, and RUNS LIKE HELL. \nCUT TO: \n141     FRISCO BAR - NIGHT                                     141 \nTrillian runs in and is immediately hit by COLORFUL SWIRLING LIGHTS and a PULSATING STROBE. FLASHING RED WARNING LIGHTS, the SOUND of the CLAXTON, the SPRAYING WATER and thick MIST...major psychedelia. Disoriented, Trillian runs towards a dark exit door -- and into a geometric gelatinous SPIDER WEB. Sticks. \nTRILLIAN NOOO!! NOOOO!! HELPP!! HELPP!! \nCUT TO: \n142     ATRIUM - NIGHT                                         142 \nFinnegan is slamming another clip into his pulse rifle when he hears TRILLIAN, YELLING for help. He takes off running through a hatch. \nCUT TO: \n143     FRISCO BAR - NIGHT                                     143 \nTrillian struggles in the web, but she's only getting herself more stuck. Behind her, deep in the web, Tentacles slowly start squirming their way towards her. Trillian feels the GELATIN start to MOVE. She struggles wildly. \nPanicked. Finnegan ENTERS the room. Spots Trillian. Starts sloshing his way through the water. Trillian sees him coming. \nTRILLIAN Finnegan! \nTrillian looks back. Sees the Tentacles coming out of the darkness of the web. Twenty feet back and closing. \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) Hurry!! Hurry!! \nFinnegan runs up and grabs her. Tries to pull her free. But she's stuck good. He looks behind her to the tentacles quickly closing in on her. Now fifteen feet away. \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) Get me out of here!! \n148     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            148 \nTrillian lifts up her feet as the jet ski touches down into the dark water. She frantically whispers to herself: \nTRILLIAN Oh my God, oh my God. \nSuddenly, twenty feet from the jet ski, SOMETHING SWIRLS through the water. Trillian aims her pulse-rifle at it. Eyes wide. Knuckles white. Breathing hard. WHAMM!! Something drops onto the ski behind her. \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) EEEEYYYYAAAHHH!!!! \nShe turns, ghost white...to Finnegan. \nFINNEGAN I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready... \nTRILLIAN Soon as I get over the heart attack... \nFinnegan whistles. Waits. No engine goes on. He whistles again. Still no response. Removes his watch, gives it to Trillian. \nFINNEGAN Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go... \nTRILLIAN No... \nFINNEGAN You don't take orders very well, do you? \nTRILLIAN I don't take orders at all. \nFINNEGAN This time, make an exception. \nHe grabs Trillian's pulse rifle, and leaps up on the side of the Saipan, and scales up to the deck. Trillian watches him, and then looks at the watch. \nCUT TO: \n149     SAIPAN PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                             149 \nFinnegan bursts in. \nFINNEGAN Pantucci!... JOEY! \nThen he spots something on the floor. He reaches down and picks it up. It's Pantucci's leather tool belt. It's been RIPPED TO SHREDS. Finnegan stares at it. His grip tightening. Tears rising in his eyes. His jaw clenching. Then he flings the belt aside. Filled with rage. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Time to die, motherfucker. \nFinnegan hits the ignition button. A desperate moment of dry cranking ...and then the one remaining engine catches, sputters, and fires to life. \nCUT TO: \n150     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      150 \nTrillian hears the Saipan's engine come to life. She hits the ignition on the jet ski. Right next to her something drops from the deck of the Saipan into the water. Finnegan clambers up in front of her. His pulse rifle still in hand. \nTRILLIAN Where's you friend? \nFINNEGAN He's not coming... \nThe Saipan strains on its leashes. ENGINES GUNNING. Finnegan swings his rifle around. OPENS UP on the tie-lines. All the TIE-LINES SHRED. The Saipan starts to break free. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Hold on! \nHe GUNS the ski...and it stalls. The jet ski stalls. Goes dead in the water. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Oh shit!! \nNearby, the WATER SWIRLS violently. He hammers the starter button. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Come on!! \nThe ENGINE STUTTERS. He tries again. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Come on!! \nAnother STUTTER. More WATER SWIRLS, getting closer now. But the third time's a charm. The jet ski comes to life and shoots off along the side of the ship. Just as a tentacle comes shooting out of the water. Finnegan fires at it, blowing it to pieces. The last TIE-LINE SNAPS. The SAIPAN LURCHES AWAY from the Fuji Maru. The jammed steering-sticks force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle. \n151     FAST:                                                  151 \nFinnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski. Pedal to the metal. Looking straight ahead. Trillian holds on for dead life. Suddenly, a WAVE EXPLODES in front of the jet ski. Finnegan cranks the handlebars. The JET SKI SLEWS SIDEWAYS. The Saipan starts to arc around. The WARHEAD gleams in the MOONLIGHT. Dripping water. Finnegan HAULS ASS away from the Fuji Maru. ENGINE ROARING. Throwing water. Another WAVE EXPLODES. A tentacle rears up. Right in front of the jet ski. Finnegan and Trillian lean hard. The JET SKI SKIDS sideways across the water. \nBOUNCING HARD. \n", "test1_input": "MASON I'll take a go and the I vote we throw the little weasel overboard... \nMULLIGAN I vote we slit his throat THEN throw him overboard... \nMason raises his ham of a fist drawing his tree trunk arm back, taking dead aim at Pantucci's face. He never gets the punch off. His arm is caught from behind. He looks over his shoulder to Finnegan. Gripping his wrist. Right in his face. \nFINNEGAN ...this is not a democracy. You don't get a vote. \nMason, enraged, swings with his free hand. Finnegan twists his arm sharply, sending Mason's head into the steel wall, knocking the big man senseless. The other mercenaries go to draw their weapons. Before the guns are out of holsters, Finnegan swings a spear gun into Hanover's face, an inch from his eye. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) I'll say it again for the hearing impaired... \nFinnegan cocks the spear. CLICK! Hanover does not blink. Everyone freezes. With his free hand Finnegan lifts Pantucci to his unsteady feet, the spear stays poised. Finnegan backs out of the room. \nHANOVER This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract. \nFINNEGAN (RECITING) 20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime. \nHANOVER And no questions asked. \nFINNEGAN Who asked any? \nHANOVER He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract. \nFINNEGAN I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indiscretion. \nWith that Finnegan leads Pantucci out of the hold, slamming the door behind him. \nPANTUCCI Thanks... \nFinnegan turns his gaze to Pantucci. It makes the smaller man quiver. \nFINNEGAN You put me in that position again I'll throw you overboard myself. \nFinnegan stalks off. Pantucci swallows hard, knowing he means it. \nCUT TO: \n32     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                       32 \nA man strides down the hall of an executive passageway, his face obscured in shadows. He has a CANISTER in his hands. Walks through a door MARKED: \n\"AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\" \nCUT TO: \n33     COMPUTER/CONTROL MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT                   33 \nThe brain center for the whole ship. Rows of computer mainframes, laser-guided imagers and D.T. processors. No humans needed. And none are present. Except one -- \nThe Man strides purposefully down a row of computers, makes a left, then a right. He knows exactly where he's going. He arrives at an ultra-high-tech CONSOLE. The cerebellum. Three similar canisters are plugged into the console. The Man unscrews the middle canister. Screws his canister into its place. Sets the TIMER to 0:300 hours. Pushes a button. The TIMER starts to COUNT DOWN. \nCUT TO: \n34     THE FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                   34 \nAll LIT UP and looking beautiful. The wind is stronger. The party is wilder. The BAND louder. The people drunker. Rain begins to fall. Everybody moans and heads for cover. \nThe deck's huge hydralic canopy begins to close, reviving the party spirit. \nCUT TO: \n35     VAULT ROOM - NIGHT                                      35 \nA gold card with a black stripe slides into the security lock of a high tech vault. Lights blink. Tumblers roll. One after another the electronic locks unlock. \nTrillian stands back as the massive vault door swings open. With a quick look over her shoulder, she enters the vault. \nCUT TO: \n36     VAULT - NIGHT                                           36 \nTrillian consults a list, looking for one very specific vault box. Finding it, she pulls a lock pick from her fabulous coiffure, and picks the lock in nothing flat. A pro. Flipping open the box, Trillian removes the only thing she came for. A dazzling diamond ring with the center stone the size of an egg. With a twist, she pops the stone from the setting, holds it up to admire it in the light... \nCANTON (V.O.) It is an amazing stone... \nTrillian grits her teeth, and turns to...Canton, the Captain, and two burly Chinese security men. \n", "test1_true": "TRILLIAN Retiring. \nCANTON Well you can still proceed with your plans then...in prison...Captain... escort the lady... \nCanton exits. The Captain steps forward, and removes the diamond ring from Trillian's hand. \nCAPTAIN Mademoiselle...you are not a lady. \nHe slaps her across the face. Trillian flushes, touches the drop of blood at her lip...and decks the Captain with a vicious right cross. \nTRILLIAN And you...Monsieur...you are not a gentleman. \nCUT TO: \n37     VEGETABLE LOCKER - NIGHT                                37 \nA hatch door bursts open. Trillian is thrown inside. The DOOR SLAMS SHUT. Trillian looks around. No windows. One door. Lots of fruit and vegetables. \nTrillian accepts the hopelessness of her situation.

The Allman Brothers Band pulses out of the speakers. Finnegan is prepping the wound over Pantucci's eye for sutures. \nAs he swabs it carefully, Leila is at the helm keeping the speeding, bouncing, boat on course. \nPANTUCCI Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit squad. \nFINNEGAN I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones... \nHe carefully threads the surgical needle. \nPANTUCCI Right now...there's some bozo sitting on his yacht at those coordinates they gave us, sipping his scotch and soda...totally unawares that we are about to deliver 500 kgs of high power torpedo to light up his ass...that's what's down there in that hold and who knows what the hell else... \nCUT TO: \n40     HOLD - NIGHT                                            40 \nThe top of another wooden crate is popped revealing the answer to Pantucci's question: a chilling display of firepower. Pulse rifles. Hand held gatling guns with laser sightings. Oblong grenades. The latest in death delivery systems. \nHanover and his men lift and load. Slamming shells into chambers. KA- CHANG! KA-CHANG! KA-CHANG! These boys know their toys. \nCUT TO: \n41     PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                                     41 \nFINNEGAN Hold still now...I was like three rows back. \nFinnegan centers the needle over Pantucci's wound. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) ...Jagger was here...I was here... \nPANTUCCI You don't give a shit about anything do you? \nFINNEGAN Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of destination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed. \nPANTUCCI That's it? That's all you give a shit about? \nFINNEGAN Oh yeah...and that my stitch job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit... \nFinnegan sinks the needle into the wound. Pantucci's SCREAM rises above the music. \nCUT TO: \n42     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                       42 \nThe Fuji Maru cruises through RAIN-LASHED waters. Accompanied by a very scary MUSICAL SCORE. Then suddenly, in the extreme foreground, AIR BUBBLES angrily GURGLE to the surface. Then a WAVE EXPLODES, as if THRASHED from below. Then another WAVE EXPLODES, forty feet to the right. Then ANOTHER, eighty feet to the left. And then ALMOST SEEN: Huge, black, ominous THINGS seem to be SQUIRMING beneath the water.

As she sits down, spreading a makeshift napkin on her lap just so, a violent SUCKING SOUND comes from above her. Trillian's eyes shoot upward. A VICIOUS GURGLING SOUND RACES through a large PIPE along the ceiling. Trillian leaps to her feet. Backs away. A little spooked. \nCUT TO: \n47     STATEROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT                              47 \nAn elegant woman sits on the toilet, her gown hiked up inelegantly, reading \"Vogue.\" As she turns the page the same strange sound, a violent sucking, comes from inside the walls, startling her.

Her eyes filled panic. She tries to stand, but she's JERKED BACK DOWN! Her ARMS FLAIL WILDLY. Scattering stuff off the counter. She tries to SCREAM, but it comes out more like a GURGLE.

Then, like a locomotive gathering speed, the grates start rising and falling, faster and faster, clanking louder and louder, headed right for the two of them. \nLOUDERFASTERLOUDERFASTER!!! \nFINNEGAN Come on!! \nFinnegan and Pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they can...just as the grate they were standing on rises and falls. Silence returns. Except for the steaming, creaking machinery...and an ominous sucking sound. \nCUT TO: \n84     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                      84 \nTrillian comes running down the passageway to a freight elevator. Looking over her shoulder, she hits the button. The elevator doors open to a freight elevator large enough to hold a dozen people. Trillian rushes in and hits the up button. She breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors close...until the elevator starts going down. \nTRILLIAN Up!! I want to go up! \nShe panics. And starts pushing the up button frantically, her heart pounding in her chest. There is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator descending...until something drops on the roof with a THUMP! Trillian screams. The elevator comes to a bumps stop. \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) No...No... \nTrillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevator...and then the car starts to move again. \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) Go up...please go up! \nTrillian pounds on ever button on the console, to no avail. The car continues its inexorable descent. Finally, in desperation, she hits the emergency stop button. The elevator stops. The emergency SIREN WHINES. A LONG BEAT. Nothing moves...and then... \nWHAM! Something beats on the roof, trying to break in. And again -- WHAM! The ELEVATOR SHUDDERS and continues its descent. Trillian backs up against the wall, staring at the ceiling, scared. The ELEVATOR DINGS! \nStartled, TRILLIAN SCREAMS. The DOORS start to OPEN. Panicked, Trillian raises the only weapon at her disposal...a high heel. The DOORS OPEN. -- SOMETHING LUNGES IN! Trillian swings her high heel...right into Pantucci's face! \nFinnegan plows in right behind him. \nPANTUCCI OWWW!! OOWWW!!! \n", "test3_true": "TRILLIAN I'm not staying here! \nFINNEGAN It ain't any better out there! \nTrillian struggles. Finnegan does not let go of her. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Lady, I'm telling you... \nTrillian buries her high heel into the back of Finnegan's hand, breaking his grip. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) OWW! \nJust then, the doors to the elevator shut, and the car starts to ascend. \nTRILLIAN Now look what you did! \nFINNEGAN I saved your life is what I did! \nTRILLIAN Who asked you to! \nPANTUCCI What the hell's going on here? \nTRILLIAN You're with that other bunch, right? \nFINNEGAN What other bunch? \nTRILLIAN The thieves. \nFINNEGAN I'm not a thief. \nTRILLIAN Then who are you? \nFINNEGAN I'm their ride. \nTrillian hears music to her ears. \nTRILLIAN You have a boat? \nHer demeanor changes, her voice goes to honey. \nPANTUCCI Finnegan! \nTrillian and Finnegan turn to Pantucci who is looking down at the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the ceiling. All look up to the yellow goo dripping from the ceiling...followed by a sucking sound. \nTRILLIAN It's up there!! \nFinnegan lifts his pulse rifle and blasts the ceiling. The sucking sound stops. \nFINNEGAN Not anymore. \nThe elevator stops. DING! The door opens. Finnegan whirls his rifle, rising. Trillian lifts her high heel, ready to strike... \nHanover, Chin, and Mamooli have their massive guns trained on the car. The Captain and Canton quiver behind them. There is a momentary stand off. \nHANOVER Where are my men? \nFINNEGAN Dead. \nCHIN YAAHHH!! \nChin charges Finnegan, the butt of his rifle raised to smash Finnegan's skull. Finnegan parries and drives Chin into the rear wall of the elevator. Mamooli jumps Finnegan from behind, wrapping his rifle against Finnegan's throat. Pantucci jumps on Mamooli's massive back, ripping at his face. Finnegan drops, buries his elbow in Mamooli's solar plexus, spins, and has his knife out of his boot and at Mamooli's throat in a flash. \nANGLE ON: Trillian. Impressed. She had no idea. \nHANOVER Drop it! \nFinnegan looks up into the barrel of Hanover's gun...and a pair of eyes that will use it. Finnegan does as he is told. \nHANOVER (CONT'D) Now, back up! \nAgain, Finnegan does as he is told. \nHANOVER (CONT'D) Everybody in! \nThe Captain and Canton are only to happy to comply. As they slip in, Trillian tries to slip out. Hanover swings his gun on her. \n", "test3_id": 365}

{"test1_input": "26     FUJI MARU DECK - NIGHT                                  26 \nA group of tony British passengers is shooting skeet. Being night, the CLAY PIGEONS are glow-in-the-dark. They EXPLODE over the WATERSPORTS PLATFORM, where TWO JET SKIS swing from harnesses, and TWO SPEEDBOATS are being hoisted up the side. \nCUT TO: \n27     CRYSTAL POOL DECK - NIGHT                               27 \nRigged for a formal party. Chinese lanterns sway in the breeze. A band plays. Hundreds of wealthy Passengers, the men in tuxedos, the women in drop dead gowns, dripping with jewelry, dance, flirt, gossip, as an endless stream of waiters ply the floor with champagne laden trays. CLOSE ON: The sexiest pair of spiked heels ever to grace the foot of a woman, stopping at the top of the deck. PAN UP: A shimmering golden gown, high slit on the sides to reveal a perfect set of legs, a runway model's body, a cover girl's face...and a thief's sharp ferret eyes. TRILLIAN. A class act from top to bottom. A head turner for either sex, and knows it. She holds an orchid in her hand. Trillian scans the crowd, looking for her prey...and finds him. Her POV. The Ship's smug Captain. JEAN BAPTISTE DELCROIX. She fixes the orchid in her hair just so, about to move... \nOLD WOMAN He said an orchid and a beautiful woman belonged together... It was our first date. \nTrillian looks down to a petite old woman, dressed impeccably, delicate, frail, her beauty long faded except from her eyes. Kindness becomes her, like moonlight does the night. \nOLD WOMAN (CONT'D) He said that it was the orchid I wore that made him fall in love with me... \nTRILLIAN He sounds like a real gentleman. \nOLD WOMAN The best of the best he was... This cruise was supposed to be our 60th anniversary gift to each other. He died last Spring... \nTRILLIAN I'm so sorry... \nOLD WOMAN I was going to wear one...special for him...like a memory... \nThe Old Woman looks at the orchid. And then at Trillian. \nOLD WOMAN (CONT'D) But without him here I don't know why I should. \nTrillian takes the orchid from her hair, and places it in the lapel of the woman's jacket. \nTRILLIAN Because an orchid and a beautiful woman belong together. \nThe smile Trillian bestows on the old woman is loving, sincere. The moment between them is broken by the keen clear sound of a silver spoon tapping a crystal champagne flute. \nCANTON (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen... \nANGLE ON: The deck where the band stops playing. Voices hush. Everyone turns to NIGEL CANTON, 65, tall, elegant, every white hair perfectly in place, impeccably turned out, with the energy, and enthusiasm of a man half his age. Canton stands at the head of the pool, in front of a wall sized aquarium, flanked by his Captain. \nCANTON (CONT'D) All my life I had the dream of building the greatest pleasure ship ever to sail the seven seas... tonight, seeing all of you here...so elegant...so beautiful...so rich... \nThe crowd roars with laughter. \nCANTON (CONT'D) I realize my dream has come true...I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for making it so... \nCanton lifts his glass. \nCANTON (CONT'D) To the Fuji Maru! Good times forever! \nCROWD Forever!! Here! Here! \nThe crowd swells around Canton. ANGLE ON: The Captain chatting up some passengers when a woman's voice, seductive, beguiling, turns his head to... \nTRILLIAN (French) Is it true what they say about a captain and his boat. \nThe Captain's libido rises as he gazes into Trillian's come hither eyes. \nCAPTAIN Is what true madame? \nTrillian takes one step closer, until her moist lips are pursed inches from the captain's. \nTRILLIAN (French) Madamoiselle...that the bigger the boat...the bigger the man... \nHis breath catches. \nCAPTAIN It is a theory I would be glad to put to the test. \nTrillian draws even closer. If looks could cause a man to climax. \nTRILLIAN (French) In school, the Sisters said testing was my specialty. \nPASSENGER Captain... \nDriven to distraction, The Captain turns his attention for a moment to a passenger introducing his wife. \nPASSENGER (CONT'D) My wife... \nCAPTAIN Enchante... \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \n28     FUJI MARU BRIDGE - NIGHT                                28 \nTop of the line. State of the art. The crew is multinational. English is the common language, but everyone has an accent. Canton, the picture of self-satisfaction, enters, sipping champagne. \nCANTON You wanted to see me Captain? \nThe Captain stands next to a bank of LASER IMAGING SYSTEMS. Canton steps up. Looks down at the THERMAL RADAR IMAGER. Multi-colored LASER IMAGES. \nCAPTAIN We have a storm rising behind us... we may have to close the canopy, I hope it doesn't ruin your party. \nCANTON (self-satisfied) Ruin my party? Captain, this ship was built to withstand a typhoon. I can't imagine there's anything on the sea today that could possibly ruin my party. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n29     JETFOIL - NIGHT                                         29 \nC.U. A crowbar quietly pops the top off a wooden crate to reveal the lethal looking tip of a torpedo...PULL BACK TO: Pantucci in the storage hold, surrounded by half a dozen crates, his wily eyes popped wide with apprehension. He licks his lips nervously, looks around and whispers into his headset. \nPANTUCCI (whispers) Finnegan...Finnegan... \nA hand falls on his shoulder, spinning him around to a fist coming right into his face. \nCUT TO: \n30     PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                                     30 \nJimi Hendrix. THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER. Blasting. As the Jet foil rockets across the waves. Leila, stripped out of her soaking wet clothes, down to her panties and bra, stands wiping her dripping wet, magnificently ripped body, with a dry towel. Leila puts her fingers in her ears. \nLEILA Gum kwa she bam dok. \nFINNEGAN It's not noise...it's genius... \nAnd then over the headset, over the Hendrix... \nPANTUCCI (V.O.) FINNEGANNNN!! \nFollowed by the unmistakable sound of fist hitting flesh. Finnegan and Leila trade a look. \nCUT TO: \n31     HOLD - NIGHT                                            31 \nA massive fist plows into Pantucci's stomach. He drops from the arms of MULLIGAN, a scar-faced Irishman with a buzz cut. As quickly as he is doubled over he is yanked up straight by the man who hit him, VIVO, a merciless Maori, covered by tattoos, topped off with venom. \nMULLIGAN You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth. \nVIVO You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countries too? \nMULLIGAN What the hell does that mean? \nVIVO Like Mamooli's country... \nMAMOOLI What you talkin'? Samoa's a county! \nVIVO It's a dot on a map... \nMULLIGAN Map...no map...I don't give a shit ...they got women on Samoa, it's on the list. \nHANOVER Mr. Billy you're in the batter's box. \nHanover watches calmly as BILLY, the Aborigine, cracks his fist against the side of Pantucci's head, knocking him out of Vivo's arms. \nBILLY At home we denosy the nosy. \nBILLY hoists Pantucci. He draws his knife under Pantucci's bloody nose. \nHANOVER We're not savage here Mr. Billy... we're professionals. Hold him...Mr. Chin... \nThe Chinese merc steps forward, and whaps Pantucci upside the head with a cruelly accurate crescent kick. Pantucci hits the wall hard, crumbling. Chin lifts him. \nHANOVER (CONT'D) Anyone else? \nMassive Mason steps forward. \n", "test1_id": 363, "test2_input": "Finnegan and Pantucci stop working. All eyes are focused on the maze of pipes. THINGS are HISSING, HUMMING and RUMBLING. Nothing moves. \nMULLIGAN Check it out! \nVIVO Hey! You hear me? Come out! Still no response. \nMULLIGAN Will you check it the hell out!! \nDisgusted, Vivo puts his feet in the water, gingerly. \nVIVO Man this shit is cold! \nHe walks toward the mass of hissing pipes. His pulse rifle rising. \nVIVO (CONT'D) I'm gonna kick your ass for putting me through this... \nThen he hears a strange SLURPING and SUCKING SOUND coming from behind some gears at the end of a little alleyway. \nVIVO (CONT'D) I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water. \nMULLIGAN What is it man? \nVIVO I'm looking... \nVivo slowly goes in for a closer look, gun out front, heading down the little alleyway. He looks behind some pipes. The SLURPING gets LOUDER. Then he sees it. His eyes widen -- \nVIVO (CONT'D) On shit! \nAnd that's the last thing he ever says. Because just then, from a dark area between the pipes, SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT! \nMulligan, Finnegan, and Pantucci stare in horrified amazement as Vivo is viciously YANKED into the pipes. A moment later a WASH OF BLOOD is FLUNG across a wall. Mulligan freaks out, aims his rifle at the pipes. \nMULLIGAN Vivo!! Vivo!! \nAs Mulligan's attention diverts, Finnegan instinctively heads for Vivo's rifle, lying on the floor. Mulligan swings around. KACHUNK!! His rifle is armed. The laser dot fixes on Finnegan's forehead. \nMULLIGAN (CONT'D) Touch it and you're dead, asshole! \nFinnegan freezes, looking up at a very freaked out Mulligan. \nPANTUCCI Don't shoot, man, don't shoot! \nMULLIGAN What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo? \nEverybody's breathing hard. Freaked out. Major tension. Blood drips down the wall. \nCUT TO: \n80     VAULT ROOM - NIGHT                                      80 \nTrillian steps up to the vault, looking around, a bit nervous, something is definitely not right here. \nTRILLIAN Helloooo? \nShe shrugs, must be her imagination. From inside her low cut dress she pulls the Captain's gold security card. She is about to run it through the reader slot when... \nV.O. \nAhem... She spins to...Hanover, Mason, Mamooli and Chin. Looking grim. \nTRILLIAN (recovering) I'm sorry... This area is for authorized personnel only. As the assistant to the Purser, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to vacate... \nMason and Chin lift their pulse-rifles. KACHUNK!! \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) Or maybe not. \nHANOVER Where is everybody? \nTrillian is confused -- \nTRILLIAN What do you mean? \nHanover steps forward, right in her face. \nHANOVER (threatening) I mean...where is everybody? \nTRILLIAN Poolside? \n", "test2_true": "HANOVER You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you? \nTRILLIAN (choking) A passenger... \nHanover blinks. \nHANOVER Where are the other passengers? \nTrillian shrugs. Mason grabs the card out of her hand. \nMASON Forget her...let's get what we came for and get the hell out of here! \nMason runs the card through the slot. The ELECTRONICS KICK IN. LIGHTS FLASH. TUMBLERS ROLL. CLICK! It unlocks. Hanover's HEADSET comes alive with Mulligan SCREAMING. \nHANOVER Mulligan?? What?? I can't hear you?? Repeat I... \n-- Mason JERKS the vault door open. A FIRE-AXE SWING DOWN into his head, WHUMP! Kills him instantly. Eyes wide open. Everybody freaks out. Jumps back. Hanover lets go of Trillian, and stares into the vault directly at Nigel Canton. Holding the axe. \nCANTON Oh my God. I didn't mean to... \nBehind Canton the Captain is on the floor, in severe pain, his clothes are ripped up, REVEALING nasty looking RED SCARS, blistered and puffy, all over his chest and arms. \nCANTON (CONT'D) I thought it was one of them! \nChin jams his rifle to the middle of Canton's forehead, and cocks a round into the chamber. \nHANOVER Stand down soldier! \nBut this is one soldier who is slow to obey the order. Hanover grabs Chin by both shoulders and gives a colossal yank. \nHANOVER (CONT'D) I said... \nHe slams Chin against the wall. In the process he loses his headset. \nHANOVER (CONT'D) Stand down!! \nChin and Hanover stare at each other, their chests heaving. Mason finally drops to the ground. All she wrote. \nCANTON I didn't mean to! I though it was one of them! \nHANOVER One of who?! \nCUT TO: \n81     MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT                                    81 \nThe machinery is sputtering, and sparking, shorting, steaming as the sea rises. Mulligan, in a panic, has backed Finnegan and Pantucci into a corner. He screams over his headset. \nMULLIGAN Hanover!...Hanover! Come in! Come in you son-of-a-bitch! \nNo response. A sucking sound comes from the dark mass of pipes. Mulligan spins. \nMULLIGAN (CONT'D) Hanover!! Hanover!! \nFINNEGAN Forget them... \nMulligan spins back to Finnegan and Pantucci. \nMULLIGAN (fried) Shut up! You hear me!! \nFINNEGAN ...we gotta get outta here -- NOW. \nMULLIGAN Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!! \nPANTUCCI What's there to think about?? That THING back there... \nMULLIGAN There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and... \nSuddenly, Mulligan's LEGS are suddenly JERKED OUT from under him. He hits the floor hard. Starts FIRING WILDLY. \nFinnegan and Pantucci hit the watery deck. \nBULLETS RICOCHET everywhere. Mulligan is WHIPPED across the floor. SCREAMING in fear. His pulse-rifle goes flying. He's SLAMMED into a metal pylon, then SUCKED into a dark void in the pipes. All in the blink of an eye. \nFinnegan grabs Mulligan's pulse-rifle. OPENS FIRE. BLASTING the shit out of anything and everything that moves. \n", "test2_id": 364, "test3_input": "128     SPEEDBOAT - NIGHT                                      128 \nCanton is pinned to the hood of the speedboat, his face shredded by glass, his leg mangled, screaming as his panicked eyes watch a TENTACLE slowly squirm across the hood toward him, it's hideous feelers writhe and arch. Canton backs away from it as far as he can. \nAnother TENTACLE SQUIRMS up next to him. Canton crawls away from that one. Its Feelers and Suckers unsheathe, dripping mucus. Canton's eyes widen, horrified. Then another TENTACLE SQUIRMS up. Canton crawls to the center of the hood. And another TENTACLE. Canton has nowhere to go. The Tentacles close in on him. \nCANTON No! No! No! \nAll the tentacles rise over him, about to descend. \nCANTON (CONT'D) NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! \nCUT TO: \n129     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      129 \nFinnegan and Trillian race for all they are worth, clamber over the side of the Fuji Maru, dropping to the deck of the Saipan. \nCUT TO: \n130     SAIPAN - NIGHT                                         130 \nFinnegan and Trillian slowly clamber through the hold, waist deep in water, on edge, eyes wide, watching for any sign of trouble. It's quiet in here. Maybe too quiet. \nTRILLIAN (quietly) Finnegan... \nFINNEGAN Yeah... \nTRILLIAN ...the minute you start your engines ...it's going to kill us, isn't it? \nThey step up to one of the big CRATES. Finnegan starts SMASHING it with the butt of his pulse-rifle. The CRATE BURST OPEN. REVEALING the WARHEAD of the torpedo. Trillian is stunned. \nFINNEGAN Not unless we kill it first. \nFinnegan SMASHES more of the CRATE, it falls apart, REVEALING the entire torpedo. He hands her his pulse rifle. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) Anything moves, you shoot. \nFinnegan starts to yank open the top plates of the missile head. Trillian looks around nervously. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy... \nTRILLIAN If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island? \nFINNEGAN Jet ski...there's one left up there. \nThe plate comes loose. Revealing a gaggle of wires, and parts. \nFINNEGAN (CONT'D) ...let's see, it was red wire cross compressor blue wire...or blue cross red? \nHe starts to fiddle with the wires. -- Suddenly, there's a LOUD SLOSHING SOUND right behind them! CRATES TOPPLE! More pulse rifles spill out. Trillian spins, ready to blast away with the pulse rifle, to... \nPANTUCCI Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!! \nFINNEGAN Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red... \nHe refers to the wires. \nPANTUCCI Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg? \nFINNEGAN Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid? \nPANTUCCI (fast) Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid? \nFINNEGAN Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast? \nPANTUCCI For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast. \nTRILLIAN How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right? \nFINNEGAN Right... \nPANTUCCI Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here? \nFINNEGAN Seafood salad. (to Trillian) You ever operate a jet ski? \nTRILLIAN (nervous) You want ME to go up there? \n", "test3_true": "TRILLIAN And what if I run into one of those things? \nFinnegan tosses her a pulse rifle from the overturned crate. \nFINNEGAN Don't forget the safety. \nShe hits the safety, slams a shell into chamber... \nTRILLIAN Don't take too long...I'm not planning on being on the menu tonight. \n...and exits. \nPANTUCCI (razzing) I've never seen you so congenial with a member of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport... \nFINNEGAN And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening. \nFinnegan attaches a wire to a sprocket. A red light starts to blink on the warhead. \nCUT TO: \n131     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      131 \nIt is VERY DARK. The RAIN is getting worse. THUNDER RUMBLES. LIGHTNING FLASHES. The FUJI MARU MOANS and CREAKS. BUBBLES EXPLODE from beneath it. The Saipan rocks against her hull. Trillian clambers along the TILTING RAILING, heading for the watersports platform. Her gorgeous eyes shift nervously. \nTRILLIAN I'm going to be OK...I'm going to be \nOK... The ship's METAL HULL SCREECHES. The SEAWATER BUBBLES and GURGLES. From somewhere deep inside the ship, we HEAR that loud primordial YOWL again. Trillian freezes, her heart double beats. She looks around, really scared. \nCUT TO: \n132     SAIPAN'S HOLD - NIGHT                                  132 \nThe missile is on a hoist being pushed forward by Pantucci and Finnegan toward a GAPING HOLE in the PORT BOW. \nPANTUCCI You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out... \nFINNEGAN A little to the left... \nPANTUCCI I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next... \nFINNEGAN Line it up now, nice and easy... \nThe missile head is right in line with the hole in the bow. \nPANTUCCI I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought. \nFINNEGAN I have been. \nPANTUCCI And what have you come up with? \nFINNEGAN How does an island sound to you? \nPantucci looks at Finnegan quizically. This is news to him. \nCUT TO: \n133     SAIPAN - NIGHT                                         133 \nThe TIP of the WARHEAD creeps out through the hole. The body of the missile is just a hair too wide, which is good, because it jams itself nice and tight into the hole. \nCUT TO: \n134     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            134 \nTrillian takes the tarp off the remaining jet ski. Pushes the swivel arm that holds it out over the railing. The PLATFORM TILTS! Trillian loses her balance. Almost goes over the side. Just barely manages to catch herself. Hangs there for a moment. Something SWISHES in the water below her. Trillian's EYES scan the darkness; scared sick. \nCUT TO: \n135     THE SAIPAN'S PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                       135 \nFinnegan LASHES the STEERING-STICKS as hard left as they'll go. The rudder locks tight. Pantucci enters. \nPANTUCCI I gerry-rigged the ignition...all you gotta do is start her up...it won't go fast but it'll go loud... \nTrillian's scream tears through the night. Finnegan's eyes go to the Fuji Maru. He kicks open a box by the side of the console, and pulls out a sawed off shot gun with a pistol handle in a holster. \n", "test3_id": 365}

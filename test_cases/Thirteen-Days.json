{"train": "KENNY Got the touch? \nPOL #2 Yeah.  Still moldable, too. \nKENNY Everyone likes a good kid... \nAnd like that, a congressional candidate is made...  Kenny accelerates, leaving the Pols behind.  Suddenly, outside the windows, the crowd swells forward with a collective ROAR. \nCROWD MR. PRESIDENT!  PRESIDENT KENNEDY! \nEXT. HOTEL - DAY \nKenny heads down the steps with New York Times Washington Bureau Chief, SCOTTY RESTON. Anonymous, they weave their way through the crowd for a police car on a side street. \nRESTON How's my favorite President? \nKENNY Busy.  But you've got his heart. \nRESTON I want an hour with him. \nKENNY I said his heart, not his attention. \nRESTON Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me. \nKENNY Well.  There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about. \nRESTON I'm doing a piece on Skybolt.  I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau. \nKenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car. A Secret Service Agent opens the door for him, another is behind the wheel. \nKENNY We're giving the Brits Polaris instead. But a story'll just aggravate things. \nScotty stares at Kenny, determined.  Kenny looks away.  And his eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.  She is talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  What they're saying is lost in the noise. \nScotty follows Kenny's gaze.  Then the two men share a look, a silent understanding.  Kenny glances at the Secret Service guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman. \nKENNY (CONT'D) Not today.  He's got tight schedule. \nThe Agent nods, heads for the other Agents and the Beautiful Woman.  Scotty acts like nothing has happened. \nRESTON Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it.  He can clear the air on Anglo American relations. \nKENNY Forget it, Scotty. \nRESTON Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you. \nThe formula's exactly what Kenny wants to hear.  He pretends to consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car. \nKENNY All right, you're in.  Half hour. \nReston's won.  But so has Kenny, and he's made Scotty feel tough in the bargain.  People like Kenny. \nINT. POLICE CAR - DAY \nIn the back seat, Kenny stares out the window at the parade goers.  The Secret Service Agents leave the Woman. Disappointed, the Woman turns and vanishes into the crowd. It's an eerie moment.  Something troubles Kenny, and he glances up at the sky.  A premonition.  But it's a clear, clear blue.  A day like this, all is right with the world... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. NPIC - NIGHT \nSix Interpreters huddle around IMAGES on a light table.  One of them shoulders his way into the group and THUMPS a black BINDER on the table.  There are grim nods of agreement. \nThe book is open to a PICTURE of an SS-4 BALLISTIC MISSILE. A photo from Moscow Mayday parade.  An icon of the nuclear age escorted like some devil-god to a holocaust... \nEND MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE \nEXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY \nThe White House casts long shadows this gorgeous October morning.  Blue sky; the first flash of color in the trees. \nSUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16TH, 1962.  DAY 1. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nBriefcase and coat in hand, Kenny enters his office - and finds THREE MEN.  Standing there.  Thin-haired, bespectacled, academic-looking MCGEORGE BUNDY, 43, the National Security Advisor.  The two men in the background: PHOTO INTERPRETERS. \nKenny hangs up his coat, sees the Interpreters' large black display cases.  And suddenly the world is slightly off kilter. \nKENNY Hey, Mac.  You're up bright and early. \nBUNDY No, Ken.  I need to see him now... \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - RESIDENTIAL FLOOR - DAY \nKenny emerges from the elevator with Bundy.  They head down the long, posh 3rd floor hall, the Presidential Detail guarding the doors at the end.  But the familiar route feels strange, and lasting an eternity.  Kenny eyes the package under Bundy's arm, its TOP SECRET stamp visible. \nKENNY Morning, Floyd. \nSECRET SERVICE AGENT Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.  Mr. Bundy. \nThe Agent opens the door.  Bundy pauses, Kenny with him. \nKENNY What's it about? \nBUNDY Cuba. \nBundy is tense.  But Kenny relaxes. \nKENNY Just Cuba?  Okay, I got work to do, see you guys downstairs. \nKenny snorts a laugh.  Bobby shoots him a cross look. \nKENNY EXCOM.  Has a ring to it.  Like F-Troop. \nThe President stops.  Bobby and Kenny stop, too. \nTHE PRESIDENT Okay.  Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into.  Impress us. And do it fast. (to Kenny) You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them. \nKENNY Then we need to do a few things right away.  No Pierre.  He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule - your movements are followed too closely.  And we need to get these guys out of the White House.  George Ball's got a conference room at State. (to Bobby) Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight. \nBobby nods. \nBOBBY I think we should bring in Dean Acheson. He was fighting Soviets while we were still working the wards in Boston. \nThe President nods his approval.  Looks at Kenny. \nTHE PRESIDENT Find him, Kenny.  We're going to need all the help we can get. \nINT. WEST WING - HALL OUTSIDE PRESS OFFICE - DAY \nKenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of hallways and tiny offices which is the West Wing.  Suddenly, Scotty Reston pops out of a doorway behind Kenny. \nRESTON Hey, Kenny!  Who died? \nKenny glances over his shoulder at Scotty who points to a window.  A beat, then Kenny returns to look out the window. Outside, the West Wing Drive is FILLED WITH LIMOUSINES. \nA flash of dismay, but Kenny covers fast. \nKENNY Way it's going, the Democratic Party. DNC strategy session.  If you can call it that. \nScotty chuckles.  Kenny moves off, leading him away.  Kenny's assistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper. \nASSISTANT Sir? \nKenny tries to look him away. \nRESTON It's Tuesday.  You said to call.  When do I get my 45 minutes? \nKENNY Tell you what.  We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff.  I'll get you up front with him during the flight. \nRESTON Deal. \nASSISTANT Sir. \nKenny turns, harsh \nKENNY What is it? \nThe Assistant eyes Scotty, holds his tongue.  Kenny takes the slips. \nASSISTANT The number you asked for. \nKENNY I ask for a lot of 'em.  Whose is it? \nASSISTANT Dean Acheson's, sir. \nThat shuts Kenny up.  Reston eyes the slip, then looks to Kenny's face.  And he knows something isn't right here. \nKENNY Gotta go, Scotty.  See you tomorrow. \nINT. TREASURY BUILDING GARAGE - NIGHT \nA car jolts to a stop.  The CAMERA PANS up over the sagging suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament revealing half of EXCOM inside.  Kenny stands nearby waiting for them. \nThe doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns: Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Ball, Martin, Dioptric, Sorensen, Stevenson, and Nitze.  They're sitting in each others' laps, banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense. \nBOBBY Screw secrecy.  You try having that fat ass sit on your lap all the way from Foggy Bottom. \nMCNAMARA You were excited.  I say no more. \nThe gang falls in behind Kenny, trails him out of the garage. \nINT. TUNNEL TO WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT \nA steel door unlocks, swings open, and Kenny marches at the head of the wedge of men into a long tunnel.  It's the infamous old passage from the Treasury to the White House. Kenny and Bobby get a little ahead of the others. \nBOBBY Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is out.  It's too slow, and they'll have the missiles finished. \nKenny looks at him.  Then there's only one alternative.  The CAMERA wipes through the ceiling to: \nEXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT \nGROUND LEVEL.  Where the brilliantly-lit flag flutters over the spotlit White House: their destination. \nINT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT \nGENERAL WALTER 'CAM' SWEENEY, head of Tactical Air Command, stands at the head of the table with a presentation board. The men of EXCOM gather around Sweeney in their rumpled shirts, nursing coffee and cigarettes. \nGENERAL SWEENEY We have 850 planes assembling at Homestead, Eglin, Opa Locka, MacDill, Patrick, Pensacola and Key West. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. HOMESTEAD AFB - FLORIDA - NIGHT \nAn F-100 Super Sabre stands under lights on a taxiway.  The CAMERA DESCENDS FROM ITS OVERHEAD SHOT, discovering the aircraft's sleek cockpit, menacing tiger-jaw paint job, the four 20mm cannons on its nose. \nGENERAL SWEENEY (V.O.) Due to the tropical foliage, the OPLAN calls for high-explosive and napalm loadouts for our ground attack sorties. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: \nRESUME \nKenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots, discreetly turning a blind eye to the President's pain. \nThe President returns from his desk, shirt untucked, disheveled, back stiff.  He eases into his rocking chair. Bobby lies sprawled on the couch.  Kenny sits down.  They all look at each other.  A beat, something like shock. \nKENNY Jesus Christ Almighty... \nThey burst out laughing.  An absurd, tension draining moment. They shoot their drinks, Kenny refills. \nKENNY (CONT'D) Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing. \nTHE PRESIDENT Acheson's scenario is unacceptable.  And he has more experience than anyone. \nKENNY There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man. \nThe President stares Kenny in the face, understanding. \nTHE PRESIDENT The thing is, Acheson's right.  Talk alone won't accomplish anything. \nKenny considers the President, his face straight as he says: \nKENNY Then let's bomb the shit out of them. Everyone wants to, even you, even me. (there's a point) It sure would feel good. \nThe President sees what Kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional response, not necessarily the intelligent one. \nBOBBY Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong. \nKENNY He's right.  And things are happening too fast.  It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again. \nBobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee table. \nBOBBY As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house. \nTHE PRESIDENT Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line.  The invasion would succeed.  Castro would be gone.  Just like that.  Easy. \nThe President is rendered mute by a wave of pain.  Kenny and Bobby aver their eyes.  When it passes, the President is hushed, grave. \nTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) There's something...immoral about abandoning your own judgement. \nKenny nods, moved.  The President reaches out for the reconnaissance photos Bobby's flipping through.  Bobby hands them to him.  The President looks them over.  And when he speaks, there's humility.  And resolve. \nTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) We can't let things get ahead of themselves.  We've got to control what happens. We're going to do what we have to make this come out right.  EXCOM is our first weapon. (beat) We'll resort to others as we need 'em. \nEXT. AIRPORT - BRIDGEPOINT, CONNECTICUT - DAY \nSUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17TH.  DAY 2 \nA LONG SHOT of an ENORMOUS CROWD thronging a bunting-trimmed platform.  The President, barely recognizable at the distance, and a cluster of political VIPS wave from it, smiling. \nKenny steps INTO FRAME, back here at the fringes of the crowd. \nTHE PRESIDENT (O.S.) Doesn't anybody in Connecticut have to work today? \nThe crowd goes nuts.  Kenny paces, checks his watch, impatient to be done with the necessary diversion.  Kenny gazes off to his right and spots Scotty Reston, along with half the White House press corps suckered along.  Scotty catches Kenny's look. \nKenny turns away, but Scotty comes weaving over.  The President continues on, but all we hear is Scotty and Kenny. \nRESTON Kenny!  What happened?  They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time. \nKENNY He was. \nRESTON Yeah?  Who was he talking to?  Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on.  What's Acheson doing in town?  And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War. \nKENNY Why don't you ask him yourself?  You can have him on the way home. \nRESTON I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me.  You can influence how this thing unfolds. \nBut Kenny stands there, mute.  Reston just shakes his head, knowing for sure something's up.  He turns and heads back for the press corps. \nEXT. STAIRS TO AIR FORCE ONE - DAY \nKenny and the President climb the stairs to the Presidential plane, the crowd cheering him.  He gives a final wave. \nTHE PRESIDENT Let's get out of here. \nKENNY Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day. \nINT. GEORGE BALL'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nEXCOM meets in George Ball's small conference room at the State Department.  Bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head of the table, very, very alone.  All eyes are on him. \nBOBBY No.  No.  No.  There is more than one option here.  If one isn't occurring to us, it's because we haven't thought hard enough. \nMcNamara squirms.  The others react in frustration.  CIA chief JOHN MCCONE, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh. \nMCCONE Sometimes there is only one right choice, and you thank God when it's clear. \nBOBBY You're talking about a sneak attack! How'll that make us look?  Big country blasting a little one into the stone age.  We'll be real favorites around the world. \nACHESON Bobby, that's naive.  This is the real world, you know that better than anybody.  Your argument is ridiculous. \nMCCONE You weren't so ethically particular when we were talking about options for removing Castro over at CIA. \nAnd there's nothing Bobby can say to that.  He props himself up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its shiny surface somewhere.  There is only the reflection of his own face. \nBOBBY I can't let my brother go down in History like a villain, like a Tojo, ordering another Pearl Harbor. \nMcCone, Acheson, and Taylor share a look.  The last resistance to airstrikes is crumbling.  Finally, Bobby looks up at McNamara. \nThe Press Corps throngs Kenny's tiny office, pushing and shoving for a vantage at the side door to the Oval Office, waiting for the Gromyko photo-op.  Kenny stands shoulder-to shoulder with Reston and Sorensen near the door. \nRESTON Are they going to discuss the military exercises going on in Florida? \nKenny doesn't even blink, but Sorensen does a poorer job at hiding his reaction. \nKENNY Come on, Scotty.  This meeting's been on the books for months.  It's just a friendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations. \nFortunately, the conversation is cut short as a dozen FLASHBULBS suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the reporters crush in on the Oval Office, and Reston is swept forward. \nKENNY'S POV: \nover the reporters.  The President, unsmiling, enters the room beside Soviet Foreign Minister, ANDREI GROMYKO.  Gromyko pauses for the photos: grim, dark haired, saturnine. \nRESUME \nKenny reacts.  At last, the face of the enemy. \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA picks up the darkened windows: the meeting has gone long.  The CAMERA MOVES PAST Kenny and Sorensen standing in the doorway to Kenny's office, FINDS the President in his chair across from Gromyko on the sofa.  Rusk, Ambassador ANATOLY DOBRINYN, and two INTERPRETERS around them. \nTHE PRESIDENT So that there should be no misunderstanding, the position of the United States, which has been made clear by the Attorney General to Ambassador Dobrynin here, I shall read a sentence from my own statement to the press dated September 13th. (beat, reading) Should missiles or offensive weapons be placed in Cuba, it would present the gravest threat to U.S. national security. \nThe President stares at Gromyko as the translator finishes translating.  Gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold, unreadable.  The translator finishes, and Gromyko stops him with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented English. \nGROMYKO Mr. President, this will never be done. You need not be concerned. \nThe President hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his glasses, asks: \nTHE PRESIDENT So I do not misunderstand you: there are no offensive weapons in Cuba. \nA beat.  And Gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady: \nGROMYKO No, Mr. President.  We have sent defensive weapons only to Cuba. \nKenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of Gromyko's head.  His gaze swings to the PRESIDENT'S DESK. \nBENEATH THE DESK sit the BRIEFING BOARDS with the evidence. \nINT. WEST WING HALLWAY - NIGHT \nKenny emerges from his office.  The Soviet delegation disappears down the hallway with Rusk.  Kenny turns as Bobby, haggard, comes up from the other direction. \nBobby gestures to the vanishing delegation, now being HARANGUED OC by the press. \nBOBBY What happened? \nThe President comes out of the next door down the hall, the Oval Office.  He turns and sees Kenny and Bobby.  He's livid. \nTHE PRESIDENT Lying bastard.  Lied to my face. \nBOBBY We're split down the middle.  If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two. \nTHE PRESIDENT I want a consensus, Bobby.  Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it.  I need it by Saturday.  Make it happen. \nBOBBY What if I can't? \nKENNY We go into this split, the Russians will know it.  And they'll use it against us. \nThe prospect disturbs the three men. \nTHE PRESIDENT Have you cancelled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet? \nKENNY You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on. \nTHE PRESIDENT I don't care.  Cancel it. \nKENNY No way. \nThe President spins on him, unsure he heard correctly. \nKENNY (CONT'D) I'm not calling and cancelling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly. \nTHE PRESIDENT You're scared to cancel on Daly. \nKENNY Damn right I'm scared. \nThe President pauses, looks at Bobby.  Bobby shakes his head: don't look at me. \nTHE PRESIDENT Well, I'm not. \nBOBBY Then you'll call, right? \nINT. HALLWAY - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE HOTEL - NIGHT \nSUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19TH.  DAY 4 \nTHEN SUPER: CHICAGO \nKenny threads his way through the host of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and ADVANCE MAN cramming the hallway on the floor of the hotel they've taken over.  From one of the rooms emerges Salinger. \nSALINGER Kenny, all right.  What's going on here? There's rumors going around an exercise in the southeast is related to Cuba. I'm the Press Secretary.  I can't do my job if I don't know what's going on.  So what's going on? \nKENNY What are you telling them? \nSALINGER The truth: I don't know. \nKENNY (deadly serious) Tell 'em you've looked into it, and all it is is an exercise.  And Pierre -- (beat, loaded) The President may have a cold tomorrow. \nADLAI There is a third option.  With either course we undertake the risk of nuclear war.  It seems to me maybe one of us in here should be a coward. \nHe smiles weakly, but gets no response from anyone. \nADLAI (CONT'D) So I guess I'll be.  Our third choice is to cut a deal.  We trade Guantanamo and our missiles in Turkey, get them to pull their missiles out.  We employ a back channel, attribute the idea to U Thant. U Thant then raises it at the U.N. \nAdlai looks for support around the room, but meets only stony gazes.  From McCone and General Taylor, contempt.  Dead silence for a long, long beat. \nKenny's heart goes out to Stevenson as he watches the man commit political suicide.  Even Sorensen, standing behind him, unconsciously moves away.  At last the President speaks. \nTHE PRESIDENT I don't think that's possible, Adlai. (beat, to the room) I will be asking the networks for air time Monday night.  I have not yet made my final decision.  We will announce our course of action then.  I want to thank you all for your advice, gentlemen. \nEXT. TRUMAN BALCONY - DAY \nKenny, Bobby, and the President lean on the railing of the Truman Balcony, stare out at the city. \nBOBBY Goddman Stevenson.  Jesus.  Peace at any price.  You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two. \nTHE PRESIDENT Somebody had to say it.  I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser. \nBOBBY We have to pull him.  He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N.  Zorin will eat him alive. \nTHE PRESIDENT We've got bigger problems right now. \nKENNY We have to try the blockades.  It probably won't work.  It may just be delaying the inevitable.  But we can't just go to war without trying not to. \nTHE PRESIDENT I don't know.  I don't know. \nHe stares out at the Ellipse where a little-league football game sweeps across the grass, the shouts and screams of the CHILDREN, so alive, floating to them on the wind. \nEXT. PATIO - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA crowded D.C. party spills out of Jim Rowe's house onto his patio.  Kenny steps INTO FRAME.  He looks at the PARTYGOERS, the Washington social set.  He stands out, oppressed by the knowledge he's unable to share.  He takes a stiff drink. \nSuddenly out of the house totters Adlai, highball in hand. Glassy-eyed, he grins at Kenny and joins him. \nADLAI Just can't get away from you guys. Escaping for a night on the town, eh? \nKENNY As the town's most popular playboy, the President felt my presence would be sorely missed.  So in the interests of National Security... \nKenny shrugs.  Adlai takes a long drink, closes his eyes. \nADLAI Gotta keep up appearances.  Of course, I don't care anymore.  I'm a political dead man.  You ever seen a man cut his own throat like I did today? \nKenny has no answer to that.  He looks down, pained for Adlai. \nADLAI (CONT'D) Well, it's all right. (beat) I came to tell you, just talked to a friend.  Reston and Frankel have the story.  It's going to run tomorrow. \nINT. BEDROOM - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - LATER \nKenny, shut in the bedroom, paces on the phone. \nKENNY We're not going to make it to Monday. I'll try to lean on Reston, but you're going to have to call Orville Dryfoos. This is the sort of decision the publisher makes himself. \nINT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nNew York Times publisher ORVILLE DRYFOOS sits at his kitchen table in his underwear, still half-asleep, phone to his ear. \nDRYFOOS Yes, sir, I understand.  But we held on Bay of Pigs and it was the biggest mistake of my life.  What makes this any different? \nINT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe President, on the phone, stops pacing by his bedside table and exhales. \nTHE PRESIDENT I'm asking you to hold the story until I can present our course of action on Monday night. \nINT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nDRYFOOS All right.  But I need a reason to give my boys.  They're going to be screaming for my head on a plate. \nINT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTHE PRESIDENT Orville.  I want you to tell them this: they'll be saving lives.  Maybe even including their own. \nINT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nAt that, Dryfoos sits up.  Serious.  All resistance gone. \nDRYFOOS Yes, Mr. President. \nINT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY \nSUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 21ST.  DAY 6 \nAVE MARIA soars over the communion meditation at a crowded Sunday mass.  Kenny, in a pew, glances off to his left. \nThe President sits nearby, head bowed.  But Kenny knows he's not thinking about the mass.  And when the President at last lifts his head, Kenny sees the calm poise. \nThe President has made up his mind... \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY \nBobby barges into Kenny's office.  Kenny, knowing his unique entry, doesn't bother to look up. \nKENNY Acheson called, DeGaulle's with us; haven't heard from anyone else yet. \nKenny finally looks up.  Bobby's grim.  And an icicle forms in Kenny's gut as Bobby relays. \nBOBBY He wants to talk to LeMay again. \n-- the voice of the Essex battlegroup: sparkling, alive, a constellation of lights scattered across the sea.  One by one the escort ships answer the carrier's SIREN with their own wailing cries, an alien chorus among the ships, disappearing and reappearing in the swells.  The communication crescendos to its fever pitch -- \n-- and then the battlegroup goes to blackout.  Like a dying universe, the answering sirens cut off, the life-lights wink out, and an appalling darkness falls across the sea... \nFADE OUT \nBLACKNESS, LIKE BEFORE A CURTAIN RISES.  And then a flickering: a FLUORESCENT LIGHT COMES ON. \nINT. BATHROOM - WEST WING - DAY \nSUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23RD.  DAY 8 \nKenny, stripped to the waist, Sorensen and Bundy shave in nearby sinks.  Bobby barges in. \nBOBBY We're getting the Soviet response. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nSpecks of shaving cream still on his face, Kenny paces, reads the inky carbon as Bobby, Bundy and Sorensen read copies. \nKENNY This is all rhetoric. (realizing) They don't know how to respond yet. \nKenny looks up.  The President enters from the Oval Office. \nTHE PRESIDENT So now you're Khurschev.  What do you do? \nINT. CABINET ROOM - DAY \nKenny, arms folded, stands behind the President, the rest of EXCOM is looking at him. \nKENNY -- run the blockade.  They'll run the blockade. \nADMIRAL GEORGE ANDERSON, 50s, dapper, the Chief of Naval Operations, nods from the far end of the table. \nADMIRAL ANDERSON Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President.  We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow. \nMCNAMARA We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier.  If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine. \nMCCONE Or they could use it as an excuse to escalate. \nBOBBY Admiral Anderson, if the ships do not stop, what exactly are our rules of engagement? \nAnderson signals A BRIEFING OFFICER who hits the lights and an overhead projector which SMASH CUTS TO: \nINT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. JOHN R. PIERCE - DAY \nThe bridge of the U.S.S. John Pierce, a Gearing class destroyer.  A RADIO OPERATOR addresses a mike in Russian. \nADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.) Russian-speakers have been transferred to all of our ships.  Once the quarantine takes effect in the morning, our ships will attempt to make radio contact with the approaching vessels. They will be ordered to reduce speed and prepare for inspection. \nINT. WEAPONS' LOCKER - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY \nMARINES in flak jackets grab M-16s off a rack, race by. \nEXT. U.S.S. PIERCE - AFT DECK - DAY \nA ship's boat full of Marines lowers away, hits the water, engine spraying as it launches forward - in dress rehearsal. \nADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.) An inspection party will then board and search the ship.  If weapons are found, the ship will be ordered to leave the quarantine area or be towed into port upon refusal. \nINT. CABINET ROOM - DAY \nAll eyes are on Admiral Anderson's overhead projections. Bobby, restless, gets up, begins pacing. \nBOBBY What happens if the ship doesn't stop for inspection or want to be towed? \nADMIRAL ANDERSON A warning shot will be fired across its bow. \nBobby stops, stares directly at the Admiral. \nBOBBY And what happens if the ship ignores the warning shot? \nADMIRAL ANDERSON Then we fire at its rudder, disable it, and carry out the inspection. \nKenny looks at the President who remains unmoved, unreadable. \nTHE PRESIDENT There will be no shooting without my explicit orders.  Is that understood? \nADMIRAL ANDERSON Yes, sir. \nThe President glances at McNamara. \nTHE PRESIDENT Well, Admiral, it looks like it's up to the Navy. \nADMIRAL ANDERSON The Navy won't let you down, sir. \nTHE PRESIDENT General, have we developed any more information on the missiles? \nGENERAL TAYLOR They are continuing to proceed with the development.  We're commencing low-level photography runs this morning. \nMCCONE The pictures will be used to firm up our estimates of the missiles' readiness and develop target packages for strikes should you order them. \nGENERAL TAYLOR Our guy running this show is the best. Commander Bill Ecker of the Navy's VFP 62, the Fightin' Photo.  Something of a character, but the highest efficiency ratings we've ever had. \nHe pushes Ecker's personnel file across the table, and as the President opens it, on ECKER'S PHOTO, we SMASH CUT TO: \nINT. READY ROOM - KEY WEST NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY \nThe man himself, COMMANDER BILL ECKER, 30s, playing cards, smoking cigars with his wingman, LIEUTENANT BRUCE WILHEMY and the PILOTS of VFP-62, the 'Fightin' Photo.'  They lounge, tinker with equipment.  Their ready room is filled with pin ups, movie posters, and all things photographic. \nSuddenly, the door opens and a pale DUTY SERGEANT enters. \nDUTY SERGEANT Sir...telephone, sir. \nINT. DUTY OFFICE - DAY \nEcker enters, marches over to the phone.  All the SOLDIERS in the room stare at him.  Ecker wiggles his cigar to a corner of his mouth, picks up, styling. \nECKER VFP-62, Fightin' Photo, here.  But what we really want to do is direct. \nINTERCUT CALL TO: \nINT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - CONTINUOUS \nMargaret works her magic. \nMARGARET This is the White House Operator.  Hold for the President. \nINT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nEcker blinks, becomes a mild lamb. \nECKER Oh shit. \nINT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - CONTINUOUS \nMARGARET Honey, you don't know what shit is. \nBEGIN INTERCUT \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nKenny, sitting on his desk, taps his fingers, looks at the phone.  He's kept Ecker on hold long enough - and picks up. \nKENNY Commander, my name is Ken O'Donnell. Special Assistant to the President. \nINTERCUT CALL TO: \nINT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nEcker exhales.  It's not the President, but Ecker is so shaken up it might as well be. \nECKER Yes, sir. \nKENNY (O.S.) The President has instructed me to pass along an order to you. (beat) You are not to get shot down. \nDid he hear right? \nECKER Uh... we'll do our best, sir. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nKENNY I don't think you understand me correctly.  You are not to get shot down under any circumstances.  Whatever happens up there, you were not shot at. Mechanical failures are fine; crashing into mountains, fine.  But you and your men are not to be shot at, fired at, launched upon. \nINT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nEcker sits down in a chair, sobered. \nECKER Excuse me, sir, what's going on here? \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nKenny stands, drops the hard nose bullshit. \nKENNY Commander, if you are fired upon, the President will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you.  He doesn't want to have to do that.  It's very important that he doesn't, or things could go very badly out of control. \nINT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nEcker lets out a long breath. \nECKER I think I understand.  What about my men?  If it comes up hot and heavy, and we don't have anyone to protect us... I'm going to be writing letters to parents.  I hate writing letters to parents. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nKenny nods to himself, feeling.  He's done it himself. \nKENNY If the President protects you, Commander, he may have to do it with the Bomb. \nINT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nEcker doesn't want to be avenged with atomic weapons.  No sane person would. \nKENNY (V.O.) I've known the man for fifteen years. The problem is, he will protect you.  So I'm asking: don't make him protect you. Don't get shot at. \nEcker down, deeply affected.  Suddenly, A BELL RINGS.  A TELETYPE goes off.  Ecker knows it's for him.  His orders. \nECKER Okay, Mr. O'Donnell.  We'll do what we can. \nEND INTERCUT. \nAs Ecker hangs up, the Duty Officer rips off the ORDERS, hands them to Ecker, who takes one look, then gazes out the window at the runway -- \nEXT. RUNWAY - KEY WEST NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY \nA CART speeds down the flight line past the waiting F8U-1P Corsairs.  One by one, the four pilots accompanying Ecker and Wilhemy jump off to mount their planes.  The cart still moving. \nECKER Get that fuel assayed? \nWILHEMY Yeah.  It sucks.  Ain't for high performance babies like ours.  Shoulda brought some from home, but what can you do?  Last-second deployments... \nAnd sees the long, canvas-covered objects on the ground.  The missiles.  They draw closer. \nECKER (CONT'D) Camera. \nA steel fragment CRACKS his window, obscuring our view. \nECKER (CONT'D) Action. \nAnd he thumbs the CAMERA SWITCH.  All twelve B-system cameras begin banging away like cannons. \nEXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - DAY \nTRACERS lace the air between the two planes as they blast over the missile site.  Over trailers.  Over tents.  Over trucks.  Over trenches.  Over bulldozers. \nAnd then they're out over forest again.  It's all over in seconds.  The triple-A stops.  In unison, the two planes bank right, heading for the distant blue, blue sea. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY \nKenny paces by the phone.  It rings.  He picks up, listens, reacts.  Relief.  And we know the planes have made it back. \nEXT. RUNWAY - CECIL FIELD, FLA. - DAY \nEcker jumps down from the cockpit ladder and turns an eye to his battered, pock-marked plane.  Wilhemy and the GROUND CREW CHIEF come running up, the Chief letting out a whistle. \nGROUND CREW CHIEF Lookit what daddy done brung home. \nWILHEMY You shoulda seen it, Chief, they -- \nECKER -- damn sparrows.  Must've been migrating.  Guess I hit a couple hundred. (to Wilhemy, stern) How many did you hit, Bruce? \nWilhemy stands there, looking at Ecker, not sure what to make of him.  The Crew Chief just starts laughing as more impressed GROUND CREW come up. \nWILHEMY A few.  I guess. \nGROUND CREW CHIEF Was them 20 or 40 million sparrows? \nEcker, sweat-plastered and foul, steps into the Chief's face. \nECKER Those are bird strikes.  Sparrows to be precise.  Got a problem with that? \nThe Chief stands there, glances at the plane one more time, and shakes his head, 'No.'  Ecker takes the Chief's maintenance clipboard from him, writes in big bold marker: BIRD STRIKES.  He thrusts it back into the Chief's hands and walks off; the astonished Wilhemy remains behind. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY \nIn Kenny's credenza, a small black and white T.V. plays. WALTER CRONKITE narrates on the television as a train laden with TANKS on flatbeds pulls out of a station. \nWALTER CRONKITE (V.O.) Massive military preparations are underway throughout the southeast in what Pentagon officials are confirming is the largest mobilization since Korea. The railways have been nationalized to assist in the deployment, here transporting elements of the U.S. 1st Armored Division from Ft. Hood, Texas. \nA PHONE RINGS.  Kenny turns from the T.V., turns down Walter Cronkite, as he answers. \nKENNY Yeah? \nINT. OAS MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nGeorge Ball stands at the back of a crowded room filled with applauding OAS DELEGATES.  It's for Rusk, at a podium up front. \nBALL Kenny.  The vote just came down. \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY \nKenny opens his door, lets Rusk in.  The President, Bobby and half of EXCOM look up.  Rusk stands there somber. \nRUSK Unanimous.  One abstenation. \nAnd then he breaks into a huge grin.  Everyone cheers him. \nTHE PRESIDENT About time something went our way. \nAn Assistant enters behind Kenny.  Kenny senses him, turns as the others move to shake hands with Rusk. \nASSISTANT Telephone, Mr. O'Donnell. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY \nKenny, grinning, ducks back into his office, closes the door after the Assistant leaves.  He picks up the phone. \nKENNY Hello? \nINTERCUT CALL TO: \nINT. READY ROOM - CECIL FIELD - DAY \nEcker stands at a phone, stares out a window at a replacement plane being fueled.  A Crusader, not his shot-up one. \nECKER Mr. O'Donnell, I've been ordered to deliver the film to the Pentagon personally.  What's going on? \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nKenny thinks fast.  Oh shit. \nKENNY The Chiefs must want to talk to you. (beat) Listen to me, Commander, they'll want to know if you were fired on.  Were you? \nECKER (O.S.) You could say that, sir. \nKENNY Commander.  Do not, under any circumstances, tell the Chiefs. \nEND INTERCUT \nINT. PENTAGON - DAY \nMCCONE (CONT'D) Mr. President! \nThe hubub dies away. \nMCCONE (CONT'D) Sir, we have the tally from NSA.  We have twenty ships stopping and or turning around.  Six, however, appear to be continuing for the line.  Including the Gagarin and Kimovsk. \nThe elation goes out of the room.  Kenny looks at the President.  The President picks up the phone again. \nTHE PRESIDENT Captain, have the ships you're observing changed course? \nCAPTAIN (O.S.) No, Mr. President.  They've just crossed the quarantine line. \nBobby grips the edge of the table, immediately believing. \nBOBBY It's an accident.  They must not have gotten their orders yet.  Let 'em go. \nGENERAL TAYLOR Unlikely, Mr. President.  We've been monitoring transmissions from both the Gagarin and Kimovsk.  Their radios are working fine. \nMCCONE One ship, an accident maybe.  Six: this is intentional. \nThe President looks to Bobby.  He has no answer.  Kenny's mind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense, suddenly understanding in a flash of insight: \nKENNY They're right.  This is intentional. \nHe glances around the room.  All of EXCOM is looking at him. Bobby stares at Kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed. \nKENNY (CONT'D) Khruschev's stopped the 20 ships which are carrying contraband, and he's letting the ones which aren't go through, hoping for an incident.  I think we should let them go. \nBobby relaxes.  Around the table there are nods. \nMCCONE If we do, it erodes the credibility of the quarantine.  He'll just send more through tomorrow. \nThe President looks at Kenny. \nKENNY Then we deal with it tomorrow.  But today he's stopped most of them.  He's done something smart here.  We gave him an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of it, preserving just enough room to save face.  We need to do something just as smart now. \nBobby's nodding, following the argument.  Kenny looks around the room for support. \nINT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS \nMcNamara, pacing on the phone, jumps in. \nMCNAMARA Mr. President, I agree.  Let them go. Four of the six continuing ships are still a day away from the line.  They've stopped all the ones we suspect have weapons aboard. It would look bad shooting up a freighter full of baby food. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe President holds Kenny's gaze, then lifts the phone. \nTHE PRESIDENT Captain, I want you to maintain contact with those ships.  Do nothing until I order otherwise.  Is that clear? \nCAPTAIN (O.S.) Yes, Mr. President.  Contact only. \nHe hangs up, turns to Kenny. \nTHE PRESIDENT I hope you're right. \nEXT. SOUTH LAWN - DAY \nKenny, Bobby and the President make their way across the lawn, out of earshot of the building. \nBOBBY What happened to speak when spoken to? \nKENNY Give it a rest.  You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat. \nBobby likes getting under Kenny's skin.  Bobby aims a punch at his head which Kenny knocks away.  The President changes gear, serious. \nTHE PRESIDENT We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships.  But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles. \nKENNY Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too. \nBOBBY We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right. \nTHE PRESIDENT McNamara's on his way back here now.  We need to pick the right ship.  No subs. No armed boarding parties either.  We need a little more time to figure this one out. \nKENNY Then let's move the quarantine line. \nIt's a simple suggestion.  The President considers him a beat, and then McNamara emerges from the White House, heads for them.  The three friends assume their more reserved, political faces as he comes up. \nMCNAMARA Mr. President.  Bobby.  Kenny.  The Essex battle group has the Gagarin, Kimovsk and the sub escort under their thumb.  We've got a few hours now before we need to worry about any more flashpoints on the line. (beat) We could use a few more hours.  I think we should consider moving the quarantine line back to 500 miles. \nBobby and the President look at Kenny like he's some kind of Svengali.  Kenny just stands there, poker faced. \nINT. WEST WING - DAY \nKenny and McNamara enter the White House from the South Lawn. They stride down the hall, side by side. \nKENNY Moving the line.  Stroke of genius. \nMCNAMARA (snappish) Of course it is.  But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually. \nThey turn a corner, silence for a beat. \nKENNY The Chiefs are looking for a provocation out there.  The President's going to come under enormous pressure.  You have to keep 'em on a short leash, Bob. \nMcNamara spares Kenny a short, nasty look. \nMCNAMARA You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby.  The President doesn't have to double-barrel me. \nKENNY Listen to me, goddamn it.  We're talking about a possible nuclear war.  You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs -- \nBundy turns back to him. \nBUNDY Thank God.  Look, everyone is furious about it.  We trade away our missiles in Turkey and we're fucked politically. \nKenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything.  He agrees. Bundy steps up to him, confiding. \nBUNDY (CONT'D) You gotta stop 'em.  We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea - they leaked it to Lippman.  The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone. \nKENNY Then they should speak up. \nBUNDY Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy. \nKENNY Yes it is. \nBUNDY No it isn't.  They don't trust the people that feel this way.  But these people are right.  And the Kennedys are wrong. (beat) We need you to tell 'em, Kenny.  They'll listen to you. \nKenny prickles, intense, but Bundy presses on, too wrapped up in his own thinking to notice. \nBUNDY (CONT'D) Jack and Bobby are good men.  But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to -- \nKENNY -- You listen to me.  Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way.  You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys.  They may be wrong.  They make mistakes.  But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds. \nBUNDY You know I don't mean they're weak. \nKenny gets in his face, intimidating. \nKENNY No, they just lack 'moral toughness.' And you think I'll play your Judas.  You WASPS and blue-bloods never understood us, thinking we want into your club. Well we got our own club now. (beat) And you guys don't realize fighting with each other is our way.  Nobody plays us off each other.  And nobody ever gets between us... \nINT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY \nKenny throws himself on a chair in the bedroom's sitting area, newspaper in hand.  The President, buttoning his shirt in a full-length mirror, sees him.  There's a TV on.  The President selects a tie from a nearby rack, eyes the paper. \nTHE PRESIDENT What's that? \nKENNY Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba. \nThe President's eyes flick over to him in the mirror. \nTHE PRESIDENT I don't want to listen to this again. \nKENNY If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again.  We'll get clobbered in world opinion. \nTHE PRESIDENT It's a goddman trial balloon.  Trial is the operative word, here. \nKENNY Then somebody'd better deny it publicly. \nThe President turns around, heads over to the T.V.  Kenny folds his arms, disgusted. \nTHE PRESIDENT Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution. \nKENNY Yeah, a good political solution. \nON THE T.V. \nLive coverage of the United Nations Security Council meetings.  Holding forth in Russian is VALERIAN ZORIN, 50s, tough, likeable, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.N. and chairman of the Security Council.  A translator relays the meaning. \nTRANSLATOR FOR ZORIN (O.S.) We call on the world to condemn the piratical actions of America... \nRESUME \nThe President's jaw tightens.  He turns to Kenny. \nTHE PRESIDENT You want to turn up the heat?  You call Adlai.  Tell him to stick it to Zorin. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY \nKenny, phone to his ear, suffers as Bobby harangues him. \nBOBBY Adlai's too weak!  We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there. \nKENNY You can't take him out this late in the game. \nBOBBY Zorin will eat him alive! \nKENNY Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble. \nBOBBY What's gotten into you? \nKenny throws the Lippman article at him. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Oh, still sore about this. \nKENNY Something your father would've come up with. \nSilence.  Terrible silence.  That paralyzes Bobby.  Kenny stares at him.  He means it, but regrets it, too. \nBOBBY My father -- \nKENNY -- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad. \nBut Bobby gets it.  Kenny shifts gears, lets it go. \nKENNY (CONT'D) Adlai can handle Zorin.  He knows the inning and the score. \nBOBBY He better.  Because nobody thinks he's up to this.  Nobody. \nINT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - DAY \nThe U.S. suite is in frantic preparation, STAFFERS coming and going.  Stevenson takes his phone from a SECRETARY. \nADLAI (CONT'D) And let me say something else.  Those weapons must be taken out of Cuba.  You, the Soviet Union, have created this new danger, not the United States. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEXCOM is transfixed by the continuing debate. \nBUNDY Come on, Adlai! \nThey all crowd the T.V. as if it were a title fight.  Except for Bobby.  Kenny glances over at him.  He has the phone pinned between his ear and shoulder.  Kenny looks back to the T.V. \nINT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS \nAdlai fixes Zorin in his seat, his voice rising. \nADLAI Mr. Zorin, I remind you that the other day you did not deny the existence of these weapons.  But today, again, if I heard you correctly, you now say they do not exist. \nZorin, headphones on, listens to his own translation, but doesn't respond, acts bored.  It gets Adlai's goat, and he begins to lose his cool.  A rumble from the U.N.  The CAMERA FINDS Adlai's hand SHAKING, gripping his pen. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY \nEXCOM is worried. \nRUSK Come on, Adlai, don't let him off! \nBOBBY John?  It's Bobby.  Get ready to send your staffer in.  He's going to be coming out. \nINT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS \nBut Adlai's tremors are not tremors of fear.  They are tremors of anger.  His voice goes hard and cold. \nADLAI All right, sir.  Let me ask you one simple question.  Do you, Ambassador Zorin, deny that the U.S.S.R. has placed and is placing medium and intermediate range missiles and sites in Cuba?  Yes or no - don't wait for the translation - yes or no? \nThe diplomatic world GASPS as Adlai drops all pretense of civility, all statesman-like grace. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEXCOM's excitement mounts.  In the chorus urging Adlai on, we find Kenny edge toward the screen. \nKENNY Yeah.  Yeah. \nINT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS \nZorin shoots Adlai a testy look. \nZORIN I am not in an American courtroom, sir, and therefore I do not wish to answer a question that is put to me in the fashion in which a prosecutor puts questions.  In due course, sir, you will have your answer. \nThere's laughter at Zorin's refusal to be bullied: but it's nervous laughter, not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a tete.  The RUMBLE in the room grows louder. \nADLAI You are in the courtroom of world opinion right now, and you can answer yes or no.  You have denied they exist, and I want to know if I have understood you correctly. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY \nEXCOM ROARS!  Fists in the air!  Bobby lets the phone dangle a beat, covers it.  And then he lifts it again. \nBOBBY John, I'll get back to you. \nHe lowers the phone to the receiver.  Kenny shoots him a triumphant smile.  The President looks at Kenny, shakes his head, a big smile on his face. \nINT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS \nAdlai presses on. \nADLAI And I'm prepared to present the evidence in this room, proving that the Soviet Union has lied to the world. \nAnd Zorin cracks.  He looks uneasily to his delegation.  They bend forward to consult.  Adlai sits back in his chair, draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of someone who knows he's kicked ass. \nAdlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his answer, managing not to smile.  The diplomatic world is scandalized.  At last Zorin regroups, lifts his head from his huddle. \nZORIN If you do not choose to continue your statement, the Chair recognizes the representative from Chile. \nThe CHILEAN DELEGATE stands. \nCHILEAN DELEGATE I yield my time and the floor to the representative to the United States. \nThe room explodes in laughter.  Not just nervous any more, not just polite.  They're laughing at Zorin's parliamentary ploy blowing up in his face. Zorin's smile is gone, his smooth facade destroyed.  And he looks like the biggest fool in the world. \nAdlai stares at the beet-faced man with disdain.  At last, Adlai stands, gestures to the door to the hall behind him. \nThe PHOTO INTERPRETERS come racing in with their briefing boards. \nADLAI Well then, ladies and gentlemen, since it appears we might be here for a while, shall we have a look at what the Soviets are doing in Cuba? \nThe Delegates RUMBLE in interest, rise from their seats to approach Adlai. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEXCOM celebrates.  Phones ring at several of the chairs at the conference table. The President and Kenny meet as Bundy picks up a phone in the b.g. \nTHE PRESIDENT Didn't know Adlai had it in him.  Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52. \nKENNY Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time. \nBundy steps forward, holding the phone. \nBUNDY Mr. President... \nKenny and the President turn to see what they already have heard in those two words: concern.  The room falls quiet. \nINT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS \nMCNAMARA I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission. \nADMIRAL ANDERSON With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship.  Firing on a ship means attacking the ship.  We were not attacking the ship.  We were firing over it. \nMCNAMARA This was not the President's intention when he gave that order.  What if the Soviets don't see the distention?  What if they make the same mistake I just did? (beat) There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral? \nADMIRAL ANDERSON Yes, sir. \nMCNAMARA And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President. (beat) John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral? \nHe passes his hand over the enormous plot below. \nMCNAMARA (CONT'D) This isn't a blockade. \nMcNamara, trembling with anger, awe, whirls to Anderson.  And his burgeoning insight is born - clear, hard and cold. \nMCNAMARA (CONT'D) This, all this, is language, a new vocabulary the likes of which the world has never seen. This is President Kennedy communicating with Secretary Khruschev. \nMcNamara JABS HIS FINGER OUT AT the plot, and -- \n-- the CAMERA RACES DOWN, TRACKING OVER IT, across the vast ebb and flow of information, the delicate ballet of symbols and numerology, this language of steel and human life. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY \nSUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26TH.  DAY 11. \nOn Kenny's T.V. Walter Cronkite reads the news to footage of a BOARDING PARTY going up a ladder to the freighter MARCULA. \nWALTER CRONKITE (V.O.) At 7:29 this morning, the U.S.S. Joseph Kennedy stopped and boarded the Soviet charter vessel Marcula. \nThe Boarding Party wears dress whites and is UNARMED. \nWALTER CRONKITE (V.O.) (CONT'D) After a 3-hour inspection, the Kennedy signaled no contraband found.  Cleared to continue.  Pentagon spokesmen expect the next encounter. \nKenny, who turns from the T.V. as the door to his office opens.  Rusk walks in. \nRUSK Kenny, we need to see the President. Something's happened. \nKenny reacts to Rusk's enigmatic expression.  And out from behind Rusk steps JOHN SCALI, the ABC News Correspondent. \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY \nOFF THEIR REACTIONS, the CAMERA FINDS an under-strength, ad hoc EXCOM - Kenny, Bobby, Taylor, Bundy, Sorensen, McCone, Ball and the President.  Guarded hope all around.  The short, balding, pugnacious Scali looks discomfited. \nSCALI I have lunch with him maybe once a month.  Way he talks, he acts like he knows Khruschev personally, but he's never elaborated.  I've used him as a source in a couple of stories. \nKenny paces behind the gathered men around the President's desk, listening, mind going a million miles an hour. \nRUSK The FBI has identified this Alexander Fomin as the Soviet Resident, the KGB equivalent of one of our station chiefs. He's their highest ranking spy in this country.  And he knows John's a friend of mine. \nBUNDY All the trademarks of a back-channel overture. \nKenny eyes Bundy, makes him uncomfortable.  The President sizes Scali up. \nTHE PRESIDENT So they'll remove the missiles, and we'll pledge not to invade Cuba, destabilize Castro or assist anyone who plans in doing so... \nNobody dares speak.  It's as if the possibility of a settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves. \nBOBBY I think... this may be our first real message from Khruschev. \nMCCONE The alternative, Mr. President, is that this could be a trap. \nKENNY Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short... \nMCCONE Why else would they approach us in this way?  It's deniable.  The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us.  This could be more of the same. \nKENNY That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy.  We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker. \nMCCONE That may be what they want us to think. \nRUSK The truth is, Mr. President, we don't even really know whom Fomin speaks for. It could be Khruschev. It could be some faction in the Politburo or the KGB itself.  We just don't know. \nBOBBY By the way, Scali, your activities now fall under the secrecy codicils of the National Security Act.  Sorry, no Pulitzer. \nThe gathered men chuckle, only Scali a bit dour but being a good sport about it.  Scali checks his watch. \nSCALI Mr. President, we don't have much time. I'm supposed to meet with him again in three and a half hours. \nTHE PRESIDENT Well, it seems the question of the day is -- is the offer legitimate? \nHe moves away from his desk.  The men watch him. \nTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) If it is... if it is, then we can't afford to ignore it. (beat, to Scali) John, we'll have instructions for you in a couple of hours. \nScali nods.  Rusk escorts him out.  They wait until the door closes.  Taylor looks over at McCone who nods. \nGENERAL TAYLOR Mr. President, I'm afraid we have some bad news.  We're getting GMAIC estimates from our latest low-level overflights. It appears the missiles are two to three days away from operational status. \nMCCONE So we don't have much time to play out back-channel communiques. \nKenny gives Bobby a hard look.  The President appears unfazed. \nGENERAL TAYLOR The quarantine, sir, is not producing results.  The Chiefs feel it's time you take another look at our options. \nThe President considers Taylor, then looks over to Kenny. \nTHE PRESIDENT Kenny, get over to your old stomping grounds.  Go through everything the FBI has on Fomin.  I need your best call: is this guy legit and is he speaking for Khruschev?  And I need you to tell me by the time I call you, because right after I call you, I'm calling Scali with his instructions. \nINT. FBI, COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT FILES - NIGHT \nEXCOM chuckles. \nTHE PRESIDENT Glad to hear we're not alone. \nThe President eyes the EXCOM members one by one, an incipient smile on his face. \nTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) Well, gentlemen, I wasn't planning on invading Cuba anyway.  I think we can live with the terms of this deal. \nThere are mostly nods of assent, big smiles around the table. Except from  McCone and Taylor.  The President takes his copy of the letter, flips through it.  He shakes his head, almost unable to believe that Khruschev has given in.  A long beat. \nTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) Ted, I want you to draft our acceptance. \nEXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT \nA long, black car stops at the end of Kenny's driveway.  The door opens, and Kenny steps out.  He says an inaudible goodnight to the driver, and the car pulls off.  He turns, facing the white two-story house with the neat front yard, the lights out.  And he smiles.  Home at last. \nEXT. O'DONNELL PATIO - NIGHT \nA screen door squeaks open.  Kenny steps out into the darkness of the back yard.  And there, in her robe, sitting startled on a lawn chair, lit only by the dim glow of the kitchen window, is Helen.  Kenny stands there tired, his coat slung over his shoulder. \nKENNY Hi. \nHelen rises, her own care-worn face turned to his.  For a silent moment they gaze at each other, searching in the lines of each others' face for the changes of a long separation. They see them.  But they've been married a long time, and the awkwardness passes. \nHELEN Hi, O'Donnell.  You look old. \nKenny drops his coat on a table as Helen comes up and folds herself into his arms. \nHELEN (CONT'D) This job's going to kill you.  If I don't first. \nThey kiss, comfortable.  But not too long, and he lets her go.  She looks at him again, sees he's suppressing a smile. \nHELEN (CONT'D) If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or -- \nKENNY -- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal.  He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President.  I think we've won. \nHELEN A thing like this... who could even think of winning? \nINT. HALL OUTSIDE KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY \nSUPER: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 27TH.  DAY 12. \nKenny, in his overcoat, steps aside as a pair of Duty Officers race past him, almost bowling him over. He slows as he nears the doors to his office and the Oval Office, DISCOVERING: \nTOTAL CHAOS.  EXCOM guys, Assistants, dart to and from the offices and halls.  On all their faces grim expressions. Kenny stands there a beat in confusion.  And then Bobby swings out of Kenny's office.  There's a desperate edge to Bobby's voice. \nBOBBY Where've you been?  We've been trying to find you all morning. \nKENNY Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight. \nBOBBY We just got a second letter from Khruschev.  The deal's off. \nINT. HALL OUTSIDE CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nKenny and Bobby walk fast for the cabinet room, Kenny still in his coat. \nBOBBY We're getting everyone together as fast as we can. \nKENNY What does the letter say? \nBOBBY They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge.  It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time. \nKenny is stunned. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) It gets worse. \nKenny gives Bobby a sharp look as they enter -- \nINT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe President, in shirtsleeves, no tie, glances up at Kenny as he and Bobby enter.  Kenny can only bear his look for a second: he blew the call on Fomin.  But the President is clearly relieved to see him, gives him a faint smile. Half of EXCOM, including McNamara, McCone, Rusk, and Taylor barely notice them as they're already there arguing. \nKenny sits down hurriedly, shucks off his coat as he joins the conversation in mid-stream. \nMCCONE My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev.  Last night's letter was. (beat) The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight. \nKENNY Jesus Christ... \nBobby gives him a look: told you things got worse. \nTHE PRESIDENT Dean? \nRUSK It doesn't necessarily mean there's been a coup.  Khruschev's name is signed to the letter. \nMCNAMARA Aw, come on, Dean! \nRUSK But at the very least... It does suggest he's been co-opted by hard line elements. \nMCNAMARA Which at the end of the day is the same thing as a coup.  A puppet Khruschev, and a hard-line Soviet government pulling the strings.  No deal.  And the missiles are almost operational. \nBitter silence.  They all look to the President.  Imminent victory has turned to ashes.  The President studies his own folded hands.  Ball and Thompson enter, take seats.  One by one, throughout the scene, other EXCOM members join the group. \nTHE PRESIDENT You know, the problem we have is that this is latest offer of theirs will seem reasonable to everyone.  We remove our missiles, they remove theirs. Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal anyway.  They're obsolete, after all. \nKenny shakes his head in mute anger.  McNamara and Rusk seem to sense the President's feelings, too. \nRUSK Mr. President, agreeing to such a trade would be tantamount to paying ransom. They'll put a gun to our head again, and expect us to pay again. \nKenny looks the President in the eye. \nMajor Anderson waves his NCOs away.  They leave the room. The Major sits on a bench in front of his locker, thinks. \nMAJOR ANDERSON When you're up there at 72,000 feet, there's a million things that can go wrong.  Is your oxygen mix right?  Will your cameras freeze up?  Are you leaving contrail... (beat) Those million things are beyond your control, mostly... But you know, when you realize that, there's a kind of peace.  You don't need to be in control. You never were in control in the first place.  If you're a good man, and your ground crew are good men, it's all you can ask for.  And with the grace of G-d, it'll get you through. \nThe young Major smiles to himself, to the phone. \nMAJOR ANDERSON (CONT'D) You sound like a good man.  You'll be all right, Mr. O'Donnell.  We believe in you guys down here. (beat) Thanks for the call. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nKenny nods to himself, deeply touched by the man's faith. \nKENNY Thank you, Major. \nINT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - CONTINUOUS \nWith a click, the line goes dead and Anderson walks the phone over to the receiver on the wall. \nEND INTERCUT \nEXT. RUNWAY - MACDILL AFB - MOMENTS LATER \nA cart speeds down the tarmac, an NCO behind the wheel. Beside him sits Major Anderson, his helmet on, visor up.  He adjusts the mix on the oxygen bottle he's carrying at his feet, breathing in preparation for the high-altitude flight. Up ahead, among a host of service vehicles, sits the U-2. \nINT. U-2 - DAY \nAnderson switches over to the U-2's oxygen supply as his NCOs belt him in.  They slap him on the helmet for good luck and lower the canopy as he brings his engines up to power. \nMAJOR ANDERSON This is flight G3132, requesting permission for take-off. \nTOWER VOICE (O.S.) G3132, you've got runway one, you are cleared to proceed to Angels 72. \nMAJOR ANDERSON Roger that. \nAnd he throws the throttle forward, \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. STRATOSPHERE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe twilight, in-between, world of the stratosphere.  Far below -- clouds, shining blue day.  Above, stars and the indigo depths of space.  We hang in utter silence. \nA silver glint appears in the center of the horizon.  It grows larger.  Then larger still.  It is the U-2.  We barely have time to register the rising hiss of its engines, when it FILLS THE SCREEN and BOOMS PAST, leaving us standing still. \nThe CAMERA PANS to follow it, but it's already dwindled to a speck, and we feel how fast 600 miles an hour really is. \nINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nAnderson's gloved hand reaches for the CAMERA HEATER switches. \nEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nThe belly door whines open like a silver eyelid, exposing the camera's lense. \nINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nAnderson double checks his position, switches to the autopilot for the stability only the machine can provide, then hits the CAMERA ACTIVATE button on his joystick. BAMABMABMABMA... The camera begins its photography. \nAnderson watches the number on the film-remaining counter spool down.  He stares out the window.  The towering clouds below rise up magnificent, glorious... a glimpse of heaven. \nRapt,  Anderson stares.  And then suddenly a BLARING ALARM GOES OFF IN THE COCKPIT.  It shocks Anderson around to the controls.  It's his MISSILE WARNING LIGHT. \nAnderson' hands flash out to the joystick, turning off the cameras, disabling autopilot.  He banks the U-2 hard. \nEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nAs the U-2 turns, far, far below, emerging from the clouds, barely visible, rises a CONTRAIL.  It arcs lazily toward us. A beat, and then another CONTRAIL. \nThen ANOTHER.  The anti-aircraft missiles creating them are too small to be seen with the naked eye. \nINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nThe cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights, the horizon outside tilted.  Anderson's breath comes fast, rasping as he does his strains going into the high-g turn. \nHe looks out the cockpit window, finds the first SA-2 missile in pursuit only several thousand feet below him now.  He waits. Waits.  Waits, still in the turn.  The black head of the missile now visible. \nHe puts the plane over, rolling out into an opposite bank. \nEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nThe spy plane's long flimsy wings weren't made for dogfighting.  They BEND terribly in the rollout.  And then the first missile STREAKS past, tries to correct its miss, but can't and vanishes into the distance at a 90-degree angle. \nINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nAnderson's breath comes faster and faster as the second missile rises up, now visible.  He puts the throttle as far as it goes, trying to outrun death.  Every second is a tenth of a mile, and every mile shortens the missile's life span. \nThe rising missile drafts aft, closing on the U-2 from behind. \nEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nThe second missile's contrail rises up behind the plane, levels off, and closes on it at a tremendous rate. \nThe third missile rises up in the far distance behind the second. \nThe second missile races up on the U-2, closer, right behind it, can't miss.  Then at a hundred yards, the contrail suddenly peters out, and the missile, out of fuel, drops away. \nBut the third missile closes. \nINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nSuddenly a car HONKS.  Kenny turns around.  Bobby is leaning out the rear passenger window of his limo.  And he sees what Kenny is doing.  He doesn't want to cut in, but has to. \nBOBBY Kenny!  We need to talk. \nKenny looks back at his son. \nKENNY Get back out there, kid.  Remember to hit 'em hard. \nKEVIN What about you?  Where are you going? \nKENNY Back to work. \nKevin puts his helmet back on his head.  Kenny watches as Kevin jogs off to rejoin his team.  Kenny turns his back on his son, and strides for Bobby's limo, dying inside. \nEXT. SANS SOUCI PARKING LOT - DAY \nKenny and Bobby stand by their car off to one side of the restaurant's parking lot.  Bobby's Secret Service Agents maintain a discreet distance. \nKENNY If we're going to make a deal, we're going to have to do it fast.  This is only getting out of control.  The only reason we're not at war this very minute is he's been able to stretch, bend and break his own rules.  He won't be able to keep it up forever. \nBobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth.  A beat. Kenny looks him in the eye. \nBOBBY And? \nKENNY And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey. \nBOBBY The Jupiters are obsolete.  They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway -- \nKENNY -- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article!  But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade? \nBobby is speechless with rage. \nKENNY (CONT'D) And if the two of you are thinking this trade is your ace in the hole, you're so wrong.  It's a deuce. \nBobby's beyond furious.  They catch their rising voices. \nKENNY (CONT'D) And it's not just me who thinks that. Everyone on this so-called EXCOM is telling you exactly the same thing: make the trade, and they're going to force us into trade after trade until finally they demand something we won't trade like Berlin, and we do end up in a war. (beat) Not to mention, that long before that happens, this government will be politically dead. \nBobby simmers for a long beat, thinking.  And boy, does this guy hate admitting he's wrong. \nBOBBY All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look.  Okay? You happy?  So now what? \nKENNY So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution. \nBOBBY And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution? \nKenny stares off at the city, agonized. \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT \nKenny enters from his office, finding Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen talking with the President.  The President gives him a brief, meaningful look. \nRUSK Whatever response we send, it will take several hours for the wire to be received by our embassy and delivered to the Kremlin.  So we're looking at early tomorrow morning at the earliest before Khruschev could respond. \nAs Rusk talks, Kenny passes close by Bobby.  Bobby whispers: \nBOBBY He gets it, but he's pissed. \nTHE PRESIDENT That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em? \nSORENSEN It depends on if we really believe there's been a coup. \nThat strikes a cord with Kenny. \nKENNY I agree.  If there has been a coup, and there's a hard-line government in power now, then it doesn't matter what we say. The end of the day we'll either agree to their terms, they'll agree to ours, or we'll go to war.  But what if there hasn't been a coup?  What if... what if what is happening is a series of accidents? \nSORENSEN The second letter is an accident? \nKENNY No.  The letter is an intentional, but it's having an effect far greater than its authors intended. (beat) What if our Jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something? Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to the hard line, not really caring if we reject it or not? (beat) And then these accidents have happened. \nBOBBY Making the second letter and the overall picture look worse than it really is. \nSORENSEN The Guns of August. \nKENNY Exactly. (beat) If they're sane and human like we are, then maybe we just refuse, and they'll let it slide, like we've been letting things slide. \nSORENSEN So we reject the second letter. \nAnd Kenny looks at Bobby.  The world stops. \nKENNY No.  We don't reject it... \nIt hits Bobby like a lightning bolt. \nBOBBY ... We accept the first letter and pretend the second doesn't exist. \nThe President, Rusk and Sorensen stare at him, mute. \nINT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT \nHOLD ON the exact same mute reaction from the entire assembled EXCOM.  Finally McCone breaks the spell. \nMCCONE It won't work -- \nBobby, Kenny and Sorensen start to object, but McCone raises his voice over theirs. \nMCCONE (CONT'D) -- because it's wishful thinking!  It's the same wishful thinking that blinded us all these months while the Soviets were sneaking those missiles in under our noses! \nMcNamara shakes his head, intrigued but skeptical. \nKenny looks him.  This isn't the way to the Justice Department.  But he complies. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) We gave so much to get here.  I don't know.  Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for? \nKENNY Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else. \nAnd Bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on Kenny - anguished, knowing his life is at its climax. \nBOBBY You know... I hate being called the brilliant one.  The ruthless one.  They guy who does the dirty work.  The one everybody's afraid of. \nKenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) I hate it.  I'm not smart, you know. And I'm not so ruthless. \nHe looks to Kenny, searching his face, then away, embarrassed. \nKENNY You're right about the smart part, but ruthless, well... \nThat breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene: \nTHROUGH THE WINDOW \nAppears the grim, square lines of the SOVIET EMBASSY.  Police cars line the streets outside it.  All the windows are dark. A cordon of KGB GUARDS in plainclothes stand by the gated entrance.  On the opposite side of the street lounge two dozen WASHINGTON D.C. POLICE. \nRESUME \nKenny gives Bobby a look.  Bobby rolls down his window. \nBOBBY Slow down.  Smell that? \nKENNY Smoke. \nBOBBY Just wanted to see for myself. (beat) They're burning their documents. \nThe final duty of an embassy before war... \nBOBBY (CONT'D) They think we're going to war.  G-d help us, Ken. \nEXT. SOVIET EMBASSY - NIGHT \nTHE CAMERA lifts away from the limo, turning toward the Embassy, past the Guards, past the brass plate which reads EMBASSY OF THE UNITED SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, up and up to the roof where black, reeking SMOKE billows from all of the Embassy's several chimneys. \nThe CAMERA races into it.  It engulfs us all. \nEXT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT \nKenny squeals the limo up to the curb in front of the Justice Department.  The doors fly open, and Kenny and Bobby jump out, head up the steps to the building. \nINT. HALL OUTSIDE BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nBobby's STAFFERS greet them as they stride down the hall, Staffer #1 taking Bobby's coat. \nSTAFFER #1 Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin is already here.  We have him waiting in your office. \nThey reach the double oak doors to Bobby's suite and stop. Bobby faces Kenny. \nKENNY I'll whistle up some luck for you. \nAnd before Kenny's eyes, all of Bobby's doubt vanishes.  In its place, a severe confidence.  A grandeur Kenny has never seen. \nIt makes Kenny pause.  He beholds his best friend become a man of the ages.  And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door. \nINT. BOBBY'S WAITING ROOM - NIGHT \nAnd a DOOR SHUTS OC like a threshold of history.  HOLD ON Bobby's waiting room.  Silent.  Cavernous.  Dim.  Plush carpet.  Heavy drapes framing dark windows.  And abandoned secretary's desk.  A row of sofas and chairs on either side of the room.  Two doorways, one at either end of the room. \nA WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors.  Dressed in gray.  Prim.  But beautiful.  A secretary of some sort. \nOne of the double doors to the hall swings silently open. Kenny glides in.  He sees the other door shut at the far end of the room.  Kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait. \nHOLD ON THE SCENE, motionless, silent. \nKenny WHISTLES two notes.  Stops.  And then he begins to WHISTLE the Irish tune, O'Donnell Aboo.  He gets a bar into it -- and there's a polite, soft COUGH. \nKenny stops.  Then notices the Woman in gray across the room. He didn't see her.  It's dim over there.  She looks at him, expressionless. \nThe CAMERA FINDS: a pin on her lapel.  A RED HAMMER AND SICKLE. \nKenny reacts.  Dobrynin's assistant?  His opposite number?  A friend?  Or more than a friend? \nHere is the face of the enemy.  Not a smile between them. Kenny resumes his ease.  And begins to WHISTLE again. \nThe haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling, filling the dim room.  Strange, sad, beautiful.  The woman listens.  And her face begins to soften. \nKenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his SONG striving to fill the empty room. \nKenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming... and the Woman's voice breaks in.  Kenny stops, looks over. Her voice is tremulous and beautiful.  Just a snatch of some song in Russian.  She stops, awkward. \nKenny stares.  The Woman stares back.  No smiles.  But in their eyes, they each see the other's fear, the other's beauty, the other's humanity. \nSo this is the enemy. \nTHE WOMAN Who are you? \nKenny glances to the door.  He considers for a long moment. \nKENNY The friend. \nKenny breaks the gaze.  He begins to whistle again.  The CAMERA drifts away, finding the far DOOR to the inner office, Kenny's tune stronger, carrying with it hope... \n-- onto the portico.  Standing there in the dark, by the white neoclassical pillars of the cloister, are Bobby and the President.  They're holding drinks.  Kenny joins them. \nThe President gestures out across the South Lawn to the gleaming Washington Monument. \nTHE PRESIDENT We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys. \nBOBBY He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons. \nTHE PRESIDENT Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet.  It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on. \nKENNY All he had was his character. \nThe President and Bobby nod at the justice of that remark. \nBOBBY How does a guy get a rep like that? \nTHE PRESIDENT Doesn't matter to me.  If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy.  All they say about him today is -- \nKENNY -- he kept the peace. \nKenny looks at the President.  The President feels it, and gazes back to him. \nThe three of them stare out at the glittering city.  The grandness of the world lies before them, and they are deciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it. The silence is beyond power. \nAnd for a long moment, they know not to disturb it.  There is nothing left to say.  The President, at last, finishes his drink. \nTHE PRESIDENT You know, we never did control it.  Not really.  Not like we think. \nHe looks at Kenny.  Kenny nods.  He knows that now too. \nTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) But we did our best.  Now it's up to them. \nEXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT \nKenny's limo pulls away, leaving Kenny, coat in hand, at the bottom of his driveway.  He watches it go, silently urging it to return for him with some call from the President telling him he's desperately needed.  But it doesn't. \nHe turns to his house.  The lights are all out. \nHe notices he's CLUTCHING the handle of his briefcase.  His knuckles are white.  With conscious effort, he unfolds his hand, letting the briefcase drop on the driveway. \nHe stands alone, stripped of his friends, his family, his job... and in that moment, mute, impotent in the shadow of Armageddon, Kenny is our Everyman of the Nuclear Age. \nINT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nHelen stands in the kitchen, a ghostly white figure in her robe, the windows open and curtain flapping as she breathes the air.  Kenny enters.  He stands in the doorway. \nHELEN I saw you out there.  You want him to call you back, need you. \nKENNY No.  I'm glad I'm home. \nAnd she knows the worst. \nHELEN How long do we have? \nKenny's voice breaks. \nKENNY If the sun rises in the morning, it is only because of men of goodwill. (beat) And that's all there is between us and the Devil. \nThey take each other in their arms, the wisdom of the atomic age so simple, so tenuous, every human life hanging by such a thread... yet a thread so powerful.  The CAMERA RISES FROM THEM, finding the OPEN WINDOW and the DARKNESS. \nINT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAWN \nThe RED DOME OF NUCLEAR FIRE rising over Washington.  It roils the air in its expanding, blood-red glory. \nIt is the sun.  The dawn in the East. \nPULL BACK THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW. \nSUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 28TH.  DAY 13 \ninto Kenny and Helen's bedroom.  And silence.  Kenny and Helen lie together on the bed.  The light burns into Kenny's half-shut eye.  Kenny is only dimly conscious of the light's meaning.  Until the PHONE SHRILLS downstairs. \nKenny is instantly up, launched out of the room. \nINT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nKenny snatches the RED PHONE from its hook. \nKENNY Yeah? \nBOBBY (O.S.) Kenny.  It's over. \nEXT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY \nTHE CHURCH BELLS TOLL in raucous celebration.  Kenny, Helen and the five O'DONNELL KIDS join the throng packing through the doors to the church.  They're all smiling except Kenny who searches fro faces in the CROWD. \nAnd then he spots Bobby with his FAMILY.  Bobby grins at him. That makes Kenny grin back. \nRADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) This is Radio Moscow.  Moscow calling. \nBut Kenny keeps looking. \nRADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D) The following statement is the text of a letter from General Secretary Khruschev to President Kennedy. \nKenny spots him emerging from the Presidential limo, surrounded by Secret Service Agents - John Kennedy.  His FAMILY also is with him. \nRADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...I regard with respect and trust the statement you made in your message of 27 October 1962 that there would be no attack, no invasion of Cuba, and not only the part of the United States, but also on the part of the Western Hemisphere, as you said in your same message.  Then the motives which induced us to render assistance of such a kind to Cuba disappear... \nKennedy, greeting well-wishers, a brilliant smile on his face, is carried through the crowd toward Kenny and the doors of the church. \n", "test1_input": "13 Days by David Self \n13 Days \nby \nDavid Self \nDARKNESS.

And then with a BANGBANGBANGBANG, its high-speed motor kicks in, shutter flying. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAY \nA simple CAMERA, snapping away furiously in the hands of a giggling MARK O'DONNELL, 4.  He's straddling and in the face of his dad, KENNY O'DONNELL, 30's, tough, Boston-Irish, with a prodigious case of morning hair.  Kenny awakens, red-eyed. \nHELEN (O.S.) Mark, get off your father! \nKenny sits up to the morning bedlam of the O'Donnell house. \nKIDS screech, doors bang all over.  Kenny pushes Mark over, rolls out of bed, snatches up the corners of the blanket and hoists Mark over his shoulder in a screaming, kicking bundle. \nINT. O'DONNELL HALLWAY - DAY \nKenny, with Mark in the bundle on his shoulder, meets his wife HELEN going the other way in the hall with LITTLE HELEN, 1, in her arms. \nKENNY Hi, hon. \nThey kiss in passing.  Daughter KATHY, 12, races by in angry pursuit of her twin, KEVIN, 12. \nHELEN Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin.  You need to do something about this. \nKENNY Kids are supposed to get detention. \nKenny dumps the bundle with Mark in a big pile of dirty laundry. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. MCCOY AIR FORCE BASE - FLORIDA - DAY \nA pair of massive FILM CANISTERS unlock and drop from the belly of the U-2.  TECHNICIANS secure them in orange carrying cases, lock them under key, fast and proficient.  They whisk them out from under the spy plane. \nThe Technicians run for an idling Jeep.  They sling the cases into the rear of the vehicle which in turn accelerates away hard, curving across the runway for another waiting plane. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - DAY \nA kitchen out of the late 1950's.  Kenny drinks coffee, ties a tie, rifles through a briefcase at the kitchen table.  The horde of kids, ages 2-14, breakfast on an array of period food.  Kenny grills the kids while he goes over papers. \nKENNY Secretary of Defense... \nKEVIN Dean Rusk! \nKENNY Wrong, and you get to wax my car. \nKENNY JR. smirk at Kevin. \nKENNY JR. Rusk is State, moron.  Robert McNamara. \nHELEN Got time for pancakes? \nKENNY Nope.  Attorney General? \nA PHONE RINGS as the kids cry out en masse. \nKIDS (chorus) Too easy!  Bobby, Bobby Kennedy! \nKenny glances up at the wall.  There are two phones, side by side.  One RED, one BLACK.  It's the black one ringing. Helen answers.  Kenny goes back to his papers. \nKENNY All right, wise guys, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. STEUART BUILDING - DAY \nA U.S. Navy truck lurches to a stop in front of the run-down, brick-faced seven-story Steuart Building on 5th and K.  Rear doors BANG open, and out hop two MARINE GUARDS, side arms drawn, film canisters in a carrying case between them. \nSUPER:  NATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION CENTER (NPIC), WASHINGTON D.C. \nAs the Marines approach the building, front doors SLAM open. \nINT. OPERATIONS OFFICE, NPIC - DAY \nA bespectacled OPERATIONS MANAGER hands a clipboard to one of the big Marine Guards who in turn hands him a set of keys. The Manager unlocks the film cases.

WASHINGTON D.C., AERIAL - DAY \nThe car threads its way through the Washington traffic, past the big administrative buildings, down tree-lined avenues, takes a turn into a gate.

NPIC - DAY \nCLOSE ON the five-thousand rolls of film spewing through processing equipment, its streaking passage leading us straight through the development machinery to: \nA SERIES OF VARIOUS SHOTS: \nPhoto Interpreters power up light tables, stereoscopic viewers, zip across the floor in wheeled chairs. \nFlying switches, flickering lights, humming motors.  It's an eerie dance of technological black magic. \nAnother pair of Interpreters loom out of the darkness, side by side, ghostly looking, their glasses reflecting the glare of the light table, like magicians staring into a crystal ball. \nIMAGES FILL THE SCREEN \nAerial shots, flashing by.

He takes a right, passes the doors to the Oval Office right next to his office, goes down a long, straight hall, into... \nINT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS \nThe formal main building, the executive mansion.  He passes the busts of Presidents past, turns left into an elevator. The doors close. \nINT. 3RD FLOOR - FAMILY QUARTERS - DAY \nThe doors open.  Kenny strides out onto a DIFFERENT FLOOR, the third.  He heads down the long, posh hall of the family quarters.  Fine furnishings, art.  The living White House. \nHe approaches the double doors at the end of the hall guarded by a cluster of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  An agent opens one of the doors. \nKENNY Morning, Floyd. \nSECRET SERVICE AGENT Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell. \nINT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nKenny enters the elegant bedroom.  The figure alone at a side table by the window, drinks coffee, breakfast still spread out before him, Washington Post obscuring his face. \nKENNY Top o' the morning, Mr. President. \nThe figure lowers the paper. \nIt is PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY.  He's wearing boxers and a tank top.  Unshaven.  Bed-head. \nKenny O'Donnell, former ward-pol and long-time Kennedy man, is his Chief of Staff... \nTHE PRESIDENT Morning, Kenny.  You see this goddamn Capehart stuff? \nThe President rattles the paper.  Kenny collapses in the chair opposite the President, sprawls, comfortable. \nKENNY Bayh's going to lose, but it's good groundwork for us for '64. \nKenny steals a piece of buttered toast off the President's plate.  The President spares him a glance. \nTHE PRESIDENT I was eating that. \nKENNY No you weren't. \nTHE PRESIDENT (scanning the paper) I was, you bastard. \nKenny takes a defiant bite. \nTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) So what've we got today? \nKENNY Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day.  We're going to Buffalo... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSE: BUFFALO, NEW YORK \nA luxury hotel crowded with LOCAL POLS: the Democratic machine of Buffalo.  Beyond the open floor-to-ceiling windows, a CROWD.  The Pulaski Day Parade, a glimpse of '69s Americana.  High School bands blare Sousa.  The scene is deafening, boisterous.  Pols trail Kenny as he crosses the room: fast, tough, on-the-go. \nPOL #1 We're putting up Potowski next time. Will you guys come out for him? \nKENNY Who else you got? \nPOL #2 There's Richardson.  Good kid. \n", "test2_input": "INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAnd they enter.  The group of men at the long, ornate Roosevelt-era table, rise as one. \nGROUP Good morning, Mr. President. \nTHE PRESIDENT Good morning, gentlemen. \nAnd the doors close on the eighteen men of EXCOM: The Executive Committee of the National Security Council.  They are the legendary \"Best and Brightest.\" \nThe President makes his way down the line: shakes hands with Secretary of State DEAN RUSK, 53, distinguished, with a soft, Georgian accent, a distant reserve. \nTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) Dean, good morning. \nRUSK Mr. President. \nThe President leans past him, grasps the hand of the Secretary of Defense ROBERT MCNAMARA, 46, a gifted managerial genius... the price of which is a cold, hard personality. \nTHE PRESIDENT Bob.  Bet you had a late night. \nMCNAMARA Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President. \nOFF TO THE SIDE, Kenny greets Vice President LYNDON JOHNSON, 54, and ADLAI STEVENSON, 62, Representative to the U.N., intellectual, well-spoken. \nKENNY Lyndon.  Adlai. \nThe silver-haired war hero and politically savvy Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff, GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR, 50s, shakes the President's hand. \nTHE PRESIDENT Max. \nGENERAL TAYLOR McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast.  Carter's here, though. \nHe gestures to GENERAL MARSHALL CARTER, Deputy Chief of Operations for the CIA.  Carter nods to the President. \nTHE CAMERA PANS OVER THE OTHERS. \nDOUGLAS DILLON, ex-banker, Secretary of the Treasury. \nROSWELL GILPATRIC, studious Deputy Secretary of Defense. \nPAUL NITZE, 55, the detail-driven facts man, Assistant Secretary of Defense. \nGEORGE BALL, 50s, Undersecretary of State.  Eloquent, a man of conscience. \nU. ALEXIS JOHNSON, Deputy Under Secretary of State. \nEDWARD MARTIN, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America. \nLLEWELLYN THOMPSON, laid back, rumpled Soviet Affairs Advisor. \nDON WILSON, Deputy Director of the USIA. \nThe President sits down at the center of the table, Rusk and McNamara to either side, and the others resume their seats. Bobby takes one of the over-stuffed chairs at the table. \nKenny finds one along the wall behind the President, under the windows to the Rose Garden to TED SORENSEN, 30s, the President's legal counsel and speech writer.  They greet each other coolly. \nKENNY Ted. \nSORENSEN Kenny. \nThe room falls silent.  The President looks across the table to GENERAL CARTER. \nTHE PRESIDENT Okay.  Let's have it. \nGENERAL CARTER Arthur Lundahl heads our photographic interpretation division at CIA.  I'll let him and his boys take you through what we've got.  Arthur? \nLundahl, standing at the end of the room with briefing boards, steps forward with a pointer. \nLUNDAHL Gentlemen, as most of you now know a U-2 over Cuba on Sunday morning took a series of disturbing photographs. \nSWINGING THE POINTER AT A BOARD SMASH CUTS US TO: \nEXT. MISSILE SITE - LOS PALACIOS, CUBA - DAY \nThe sweltering Cuban countryside.  Shouting SOVIET ROCKET TROOPS, stripped to the waist, glistening with sweat, machete a clearing under scattered, limp palm trees. \nLUNDAHL (V.O.) Our analysis at NPIC indicates the Soviet Union has followed its conventional weapons build-up in Cuba with the introduction of surface-to surface medium-range ballistic missiles, or MRBMs.  Our official estimate at this time is that this missile system is the SS-4 Sandal.  We do not believe these missiles are as yet operational. \nA bulldozer TEARS through the undergrowth.  FILLING THE SCREEN.  A 70-foot long MISSILE TRANSPORTER creeps along in the bulldozer's wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded cargo. \nINT. CABINET ROOM - DAY \nLundahl raps his second board: a map of the United States, Cuba visible in the lower corner.  An ARC is drawn clearly across the U.S., encompassing the entire Southeast. \nLUNDAHL IRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a 3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles.  So far we have identified 32 missiles served by around 3400 men, undoubtedly all Soviet personnel.  Our cities and military installations in the Southeast, as far north as Washington, are in range of these weapons, and in the event of a launch, would only have five minutes of warning. \nGENERAL CARTER Five minutes, gentlemen.  Five minutes. \nGENERAL TAYLOR In those five minutes they could kill 80 million Americans and destroy a significant number of our bomber bases, degrading our retaliatory options.  The Joint Chiefs' consensus is that this is a massively destabilizing move, upsetting the nuclear balance. \nThe President stares at Lundahl, and beating out each word. \nTHE PRESIDENT Arthur.  Are. You. Sure? \nLundahl looks around the room.  Everyone is hanging. \nLUNDAHL Yes, Mr. President.  These are nuclear missiles. \nThe men come to grips with their own fears, own anger. \n", "test2_true": "LUNDAHL General Taylor can answer that question better than I can. \nGeneral Taylor drops a memo on the table WHICH BECOMES: \nEXT. FIELD TABLE - MISSILE SITE, CUBA - DAY \nSCHEMATICS slapped down on a camp table.  A group of Soviet site ENGINEERS point and gesture as they study their ground from a shaded hillock.  CLEARING CREWS and SURVEYORS work and sweat in the distance. \nGENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.) GMAIC estimates ten to fourteen days. However, a crash program to ready the missiles could cut that time. \nINT. CABINET ROOM - DAY \nTaylor sees the grim looks all around. \nGENERAL TAYLOR I have to stress that there may be more missiles that we don't know about.  We need more U-2 coverage. \nKenny lets out his breath.  He catches Bobby's eye.  This is unbelievable. \nTHE PRESIDENT Is there any indication - anything at all - that suggests they intend to use these missiles in some sort of first strike? \nGENERAL CARTER Not at present, sir.  But I think the prudent answer is we don't know. \nTHE PRESIDENT Do we have any sort of intelligence from CIA on what Khruschev is thinking? \nGENERAL CARTER No, Mr. President.  We don't.  We just don't know what's happening inside the Kremlin at that level. \nBOBBY They lied to us.  Two weeks ago Dobrynin told me to my face Khurschev had no intention of putting missiles into Cuba. They said themselves, this is our backyard. \nThere's angry agreement.  The President cuts it off. \nTHE PRESIDENT Gentlemen, I want first reactions. Assuming for a moment Khruschev has not gone off the deep end and intends to start World War Three, what are we looking at? \nRusk glances to his team at the end of the table.  Ball, Johnson, Martin, Thompson and Stevenson. \nRUSK Mr. President, I believe my team is in agreement.  If we permit the introduction of nuclear missiles to a Soviet satellite nation in our hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences will be too terrible to contemplate. The Russians are trying to show the world they can do whatever they want, wherever they want, and we're powerless to stop them.  If they succeed... \nBOBBY It will be Munich all over again. \nRUSK Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive.  Confidence in our security commitments around the world will falter, allies will become unsure in the face of Soviet pressure, and the Soviets will be emboldened to push us even harder.  We must remove the missiles one way or another.  It seems to me the options are either to build up the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit them.  An air strike. \nThere's silence at the table.  Some nods.  Understanding. \nTHE PRESIDENT Bob? \nMCNAMARA We've worked up several military scenarios.  Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational.  Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched. \nAnd there it is.  The clock is running. \nBUNDY Sir.  We need to consider... if we decide to act, there's a good chance we'll end up in a general war. \nThe room falls silent.  The President leans back in his chair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing them. \nKenny and the others watch him in silence.  A long, dramatic pause.  A course that will change history is about to be chosen.  The President leans forward, folds his hands on the table.  Fated.  Grave. \nTHE PRESIDENT It's clear we cannot permit Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba.  We must get those missiles out. \nEXT. THE ROSE GARDEN - DAY \nKenny and Bobby follow the President down a path through the Rose Garden.  The shock of the morning has worn off.  The President stops, looks at them. \nTHE PRESIDENT I don't think it's going to matter what Khruschev's intentions are.  I tell you, right now... I don't see any way around hitting them. \nA long moment of silence as they move along again. \nKENNY If we hit 'em, kill a lot of Russians, they'll move against Berlin.  They attack Berlin, that's NATO... and we're at war. \nThe guys stop again.  The autumn day is bright, warm, alive. The air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train of logic for a beat.  And in their faces we see that all three men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its shadow over everything.  It's only a couple of steps away. Steps that they're seriously contemplating. \nBOBBY Damned if we do, but if we don't, we're in a war for sure somewhere else in six months. \nPained, the President turns away. \nTHE PRESIDENT No choice.  This is going to cost lives any way we go.  Do nothing, and it could be 80 million  of ours.  We have to get rid of those missiles. \nKENNY There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them. \nBOBBY He's right, Jack.  Taylor is saying we may have some time.  We've got to use it. \nTHE PRESIDENT So if there are alternatives that make sense - and I'm not saying there are - we need 'em.  Need 'em fast. \nBOBBY What about the allies?  Congress?  I think we may need to start letting key people know.  And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up.  Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours. \nTHE PRESIDENT We can't worry about everything right now.  We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it. \nKENNY The other thing is... \nBOBBY ... I know.  CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs. \nKENNY They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon.  We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats.  We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here. \nBOBBY We got a bunch of smart guys.  We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options. \nKenny and the President look at him.  Bobby nods. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) I'll do it. \nKENNY (to the President) It's too politicized with you in there, anyway.  They need to be able to stick their necks out. \nBOBBY It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council.  We'll call it EXCOM. \n", "test3_input": "EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT \nKenny, bundled in an overcoat, steps outside the North Entrance.  The cool air invigorates him.  He eyes the fence, Pennsylvania Avenue beyond it, seeming to isolate this world from the living city beyond.  He starts for the main gate. \nEXT. MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS \nA WHITE HOUSE POLICE OFFICER jumps up as Kenny approaches. \nPOLICE OFFICER Would you like me to call a car, Mr. O'Donnell. \nKenny checks his watch. \nKENNY How long will it take to get someone up? \nPOLICE OFFICER Fifteen minutes, maybe.  To your house, sir? \nKenny considers, shakes his head.  He wants to go home, but... \nKENNY No.  No, I'll let her sleep.  Let 'em sleep. \nKenny says it with a certain finality.  The Police Officer nods, and Kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering the weight of the world. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nKenny makes his way down a sidewalk not far from the White House.  A 24-hour drug store's doors are open.  He pauses. \nInside, a knot of PEOPLE - late-night deliverymen, a cop, the store employees - talk in undertones at the counter.  Behind it, a T.V. is signing off with the national anthem.  Sober voices, sober looks.  Kenny moves on. \nEXT. NEWS STAND - NIGHT \nA cluster of COLLEGE STUDENTS talk at a news stand.  They're waiting for the NEWSIE to cut the bands of the next day's Washington Post, the bundles just being thrown to the sidewalk from the delivery truck.  Kenny approaches. \nIn their thing beards, counter-culture clothes, the kids seem so young, Kenny so old.  Kenny buys a newspaper, its dire headlines, every story about the crisis. \nEXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NIGHT \nKenny, newspaper under his arm, continues down the street. Up ahead, the lights are on in a Catholic Church.  Lines of CHURCHGOERS are at the door.  Kenny stops, surprised at the sight this late.  And then he sees the hand-painted banner: CONFESSIONS 24 HOURS.  PRAY FOR PEACE. \nKenny is moved.  He glances over his shoulder, and then... joins the line himself. \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - DAY \nKenny's WATCH reads one minute til ten o'clock.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: \nKenny, standing just inside the open doors to the White House Situation Room, a state-of-the-art conference room.  A long, central table surrounded by leather chairs with phones and screens built in.  T.V. monitors hang from the ceilings in the corners.  There are no windows, just oppressive bunker like walls.  It's far underground. \nAcross the room the President paces, phone in hand.  Half of EXCOM is in their seats.  The other half, along with a steady stream of DUTY OFFICERS, are coming and going.  Kenny steps aside for a Duty Officer, listens to the President. \nTHE PRESIDENT Okay, Bob, I'm putting you on intercom. \nSuddenly, McNamara's VOICE fills the room. \nMCNAMARA (O.S.) Hey, guys, can you hear me? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - DAY \nMcNamara stands, phone in hand. \nMCNAMARA I have one minute til ten here -- \nTHE CAMERA TRACKS AROUND HIM, REVEALING: \nA large, elaborate war room, like Mission Control.  Big screens, plexiglass tracking boards, tiered banks of communications equipment.  A massive LIGHT TABLE on the floor at the center of the room projects a map of the Caribbean and Atlantic.  Arcing across it is a RED LINE: the blockade. \nThe map is covered with cryptic military notations; WATCH OFFICERS on a platform which swings out over it update the latest ship positions. \nMcNamara's in a booth overlooking the room.  It's open to the next tier below where Admiral Anderson is giving orders. \nMCNAMARA (CONT'D) -- and no sign of them stopping. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY \nKenny and Bobby move to the President's end of the table, sit down across from each other in mirror-image fashion.  EXCOM looks to the President.  The second hand of the clock on the wall wheels past 12.  A hush falls over the room. \nTHE PRESIDENT Bob, the quarantine is now in effect. \nINT. FLAG PLOT - DAY \nMcNamara is mute for a beat.  He turns to view the big room. \nMCNAMARA Then it looks like our first customers are the Gagarin and Kimovsk. \nHe nods to Admiral Anderson, who calls an order down to a Watch Officer on the floor, and on screens all around the room, a sector of the map MAGNIFIES the unfolding encounter -- \nEXT. BRIDGE WING - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY \n-- between the destroyer, U.S.S. Pierce and the SOVIET FREIGHTERS Gagarin and Kimovsk.  The Pierce's bridge wings are crammed with helmeted OFFICERS and LOOKOUTS.  They peer through binoculars at the distant ships, plowing ahead, straight for them.  The CAPTAIN lowers his binoculars, determined. \nCAPTAIN Helm, shape heading for intercept, zero one zero.  All ahead full -- \nOFFICER (O.S.) -- new contact!  New contact! \nEveryone whirls to the bridge.  The Captain steps forward. \nINT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY \nThe Captain ducks into the CIC.  The CHIEF SONARAN reports. \n", "test3_true": "CAPTAIN A submarine... \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY \nThe President reacts.  Kenny and Bobby react. \nGENERAL TAYLOR It's protecting the freighters. \nConsternation.  The President picks up the phone. \nTHE PRESIDENT Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first? \nMCNAMARA (O.S.) I'm afraid not, Mr. President.  The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships.  Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub. \nAll around the room frustration.  Bobby shakes his head. Kenny sinks back in his chair.  The President hesitates. \nTHE PRESIDENT Put me through to the Pierce. \nINT. FLAG PLOT - DAY \nAdmiral Anderson nods to a COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER.  The man makes the connection on a switchboard. \nMcNamara casts an eye to the map.  The two red MARKERS labeled Gagarin and Kimovsk are joined by a third: the SUB. They are ALMOST TOUCHING the blockade line.  On the other side, the single blue marker for the Pierce. \nINT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY \nThe Captain enters the bridge, takes the phone from the arm of his chair. \nCAPTAIN Mr. President? \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe President holds the phone, agonized. \nTHE PRESIDENT Captain, can you force that submarine to the surface for inspection without damaging it yourself? \nINT. BRIDGE, U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY \nCAPTAIN I can bring it up, Mr. President.  But whether it's damaged or not is up to the sub. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe President lowers the phone, looks to Bobby and Kenny. \nMCCONE Even if they force it up, that sub will be inspected over the crews' dead bodies.  They'd be executed for allowing it when they got home. \nAll eyes are on the President.  His eyes are closed tight, face gray, hand over his mouth.  The time of decision is at hand.  He lifts the phone once again. \nTHE PRESIDENT Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection. \nMCNAMARA (O.S.) Mr. President!  We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping! \nTHE PRESIDENT (to phone) Captain, belay that order! (to McNamara) Bob, where's that coming from! \nMCNAMARA (O.S.) Just a second, Mr. President. \nTHE PRESIDENT Will somebody find out what's going on?! \nMcCone jumps up, leaves the room.  The President looks at Kenny, tense.  Everyone holds their breath. \nRUSK Are they stopping? \nThe HISS of static on the open line fills the room.  Silence. \nEXT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. JOHN R. PIERCE - CONTINUOUS \nLookouts peer across the water at the oncoming Soviet Freighter. \nBINOCULAR POV: \nOf the Soviet Bridge, where their LOOKOUTS are staring right back through their binoculars. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY \nThe HISS of static.  And then. \nMCNAMARA (O.S.) Mr. President? \nINT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS \nMcNamara is grinning wildly at the chaos unfolding in the flag plot below.  Phones are ringing everywhere. \nON THE LIGHT TABLE \nThe Watch Officers' hands fly from one notation to the other, circling the Soviet ships, marking them DEAD IN THE WATER. \nMCNAMARA -- we've got reports coming from all over!  The ships are stopping!  Some... are turning around! \nINT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe room EXPLODES, victorious.  Kenny and Bobby break into big grins, grab each other.  Kenny pumps the President's hand.  Rusk and Bundy slap each other on the back. \nRUSK We were eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fellow just blinked. \nThe ruckus goes on for a minute.  McCone comes back in. \nMCCONE Mr. President. \nHis voice is lost in the celebration.  McCone calls out: \n"}

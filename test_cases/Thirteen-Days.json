{"test1_input": "The Press Corps throngs Kenny's tiny office, pushing and shoving for a vantage at the side door to the Oval Office, waiting for the Gromyko photo-op.  Kenny stands shoulder-to shoulder with Reston and Sorensen near the door. \nRESTON Are they going to discuss the military exercises going on in Florida? \nKenny doesn't even blink, but Sorensen does a poorer job at hiding his reaction. \nKENNY Come on, Scotty.  This meeting's been on the books for months.  It's just a friendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations. \nFortunately, the conversation is cut short as a dozen FLASHBULBS suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the reporters crush in on the Oval Office, and Reston is swept forward. \nKENNY'S POV: \nover the reporters.  The President, unsmiling, enters the room beside Soviet Foreign Minister, ANDREI GROMYKO.  Gromyko pauses for the photos: grim, dark haired, saturnine. \nRESUME \nKenny reacts.  At last, the face of the enemy. \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA picks up the darkened windows: the meeting has gone long.  The CAMERA MOVES PAST Kenny and Sorensen standing in the doorway to Kenny's office, FINDS the President in his chair across from Gromyko on the sofa.  Rusk, Ambassador ANATOLY DOBRINYN, and two INTERPRETERS around them. \nTHE PRESIDENT So that there should be no misunderstanding, the position of the United States, which has been made clear by the Attorney General to Ambassador Dobrynin here, I shall read a sentence from my own statement to the press dated September 13th. (beat, reading) Should missiles or offensive weapons be placed in Cuba, it would present the gravest threat to U.S. national security. \nThe President stares at Gromyko as the translator finishes translating.  Gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold, unreadable.  The translator finishes, and Gromyko stops him with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented English. \nGROMYKO Mr. President, this will never be done. You need not be concerned. \nThe President hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his glasses, asks: \nTHE PRESIDENT So I do not misunderstand you: there are no offensive weapons in Cuba. \nA beat.  And Gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady: \nGROMYKO No, Mr. President.  We have sent defensive weapons only to Cuba. \nKenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of Gromyko's head.  His gaze swings to the PRESIDENT'S DESK. \nBENEATH THE DESK sit the BRIEFING BOARDS with the evidence. \nINT. WEST WING HALLWAY - NIGHT \nKenny emerges from his office.  The Soviet delegation disappears down the hallway with Rusk.  Kenny turns as Bobby, haggard, comes up from the other direction. \nBobby gestures to the vanishing delegation, now being HARANGUED OC by the press. \nBOBBY What happened? \nThe President comes out of the next door down the hall, the Oval Office.  He turns and sees Kenny and Bobby.  He's livid. \nTHE PRESIDENT Lying bastard.  Lied to my face. \nBOBBY We're split down the middle.  If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two. \nTHE PRESIDENT I want a consensus, Bobby.  Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it.  I need it by Saturday.  Make it happen. \nBOBBY What if I can't? \nKENNY We go into this split, the Russians will know it.  And they'll use it against us. \nThe prospect disturbs the three men. \nTHE PRESIDENT Have you cancelled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet? \nKENNY You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on. \nTHE PRESIDENT I don't care.  Cancel it. \nKENNY No way. \nThe President spins on him, unsure he heard correctly. \nKENNY (CONT'D) I'm not calling and cancelling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly. \nTHE PRESIDENT You're scared to cancel on Daly. \nKENNY Damn right I'm scared. \nThe President pauses, looks at Bobby.  Bobby shakes his head: don't look at me. \nTHE PRESIDENT Well, I'm not. \nBOBBY Then you'll call, right? \nINT. HALLWAY - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE HOTEL - NIGHT \nSUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19TH.  DAY 4 \nTHEN SUPER: CHICAGO \nKenny threads his way through the host of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and ADVANCE MAN cramming the hallway on the floor of the hotel they've taken over.  From one of the rooms emerges Salinger. \nSALINGER Kenny, all right.  What's going on here? There's rumors going around an exercise in the southeast is related to Cuba. I'm the Press Secretary.  I can't do my job if I don't know what's going on.  So what's going on? \nKENNY What are you telling them? \nSALINGER The truth: I don't know. \nKENNY (deadly serious) Tell 'em you've looked into it, and all it is is an exercise.  And Pierre -- (beat, loaded) The President may have a cold tomorrow. \n", "test1_true": "SALINGER Damn it, Kenny.  Goddamn it! \nINT. RECEPTION HALL - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE - NIGHT \nA big 100-dollar-a-plate dinner is in full swing to a dinner band's tunes.  The President and Chicago MAYOR RICHARD DALY make the rounds among the fund raising CROWD.  Kenny follows them at a respectful distance, greeting old cronies. \nSuddenly a MESSENGER hustles over to Kenny, hands him a note. Kenny makes eye contact with the President, nods and leaves. \nINT. HOTEL ELEVATORS - NIGHT \nKenny waits at the elevator.  Scotty saunters up behind him. He sizes Kenny up, clears his throat.  Kenny turns around. \nRESTON There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert.  That exercise is an invasion. \nKENNY Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi. \nRESTON This is about Cuba. \nKenny freezes, then explodes. \nKENNY Cuba?  You're fucking crazy.  We are not invading Cuba.  Nobody gives a rat's ass about Cuba.  Not now, not ever. If you print something like that, all you're going to do is inflame the situation.  Nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations.  Assholes like that can find themselves cut out of the loop. \nReston is taken aback.  Stung silence for a beat.  Kenny's response is far louder than any \"yes.\"  Now Kenny realizes it. \nRESTON You've never threatened me before. \nAnd Kenny looks away, upset, but when he turns back to Reston, all that's there is his poker face.  The elevator arrives. \nRESTON (CONT'D) All right.  I'm not going to print anything until I have another source. But I promise you, I'll get one. \nKenny boards the elevator.  The doors shut on Scotty. \nINT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nKenny closes his eyes, sags against the wall, hating himself. \nINT. KENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nKenny enters his hotel room.  An Assistant waits with the phone, hands it straight to Kenny. \nKENNY (to Assistant) Tell Pierre I need to talk to him. (to phone) Bobby? \nINT.

STREET OUTSIDE SHERATON-BLACKSTONE HOTEL - DAY \nSUPER: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 20TH.  DAY 5 \nThe President emerges from the hotel, a HAT on his head.  The Press and a CROWD surge forward, crying out for the President's attention.  Kenny slides into the limo first as the President waves to the crowd. \nSalinger waits on the sidewalk, and after the limo pulls away, the Press pushes in on him.  Pierre's face is pale - he's just been told everything. \nSALINGER The President has a cold.  He is cancelling the remainder of this trip and is returning to Washington on the advice of his doctor. \nINT. WHITE HOUSE MANSION - OVAL ROOM - DAY \nThe White House Oval ROOM: opulent, filled with priceless art and furniture, but cramped.  EXCOM members crowd around the center coffee table and the President.  Kenny stands behind him with Bobby.  Rusk rises from his seat, formal. \nRUSK Mr. President, our deliberations have led us to the conclusion that, for the moment, a blockade of offensive weapons to Cuba is our best option.  But we'll still need a strong showing of support from the Organization of American States to give us an umbrella of legitimacy. \nAt long last... Kenny looks at Bobby, relieved.  They've bought time to find a settlement.  Bobby smiles a small smile: what were you so worried about? \nMCNAMARA A blockade is technically an act of war, therefore we recommend calling the action a quarantine. \nMcNamara folder in hand, opens it, SMASH CUTTING US TO: \nEXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY \nA SOVIET FREIGHTER churning its way south. \nMCNAMARA (V.O.)

He listens, looks over the briefing papers as McNamara continues.  Everyone watches the President. \nMCNAMARA A quarantine prevents more missiles from reaching Cuba, but it doesn't remove the ones already there.  It gives the Soviets a chance to pull back without war.  If they refuse to remove the missiles before they're operational, we retain the option to strike or invade. \nBOBBY We believe that a surprise attack would be counter to what the United States stands for.  We believe that an attack leaves us no room for maneuver, and the inevitable Soviet response will force us into a war we do not want.  A war that, this time, will really end all war. \nMCCONE Mr. President, there are still those of us who believe we should proceed with the strikes.  With the blockade, we lose strategic surprise and we run the risk of a first strike if the Soviets decide they have to use the missiles or lose them. \nThe President gazes from one expectant face to another.  But he himself remains unreadable. \nTHE PRESIDENT Quarantine or air strike. \nAdlai clears his throat.  Everyone looks over at him.  He stares down at his clasped hands for a beat.

Will your cameras freeze up?  Are you leaving contrail... (beat) Those million things are beyond your control, mostly... But you know, when you realize that, there's a kind of peace.  You don't need to be in control. You never were in control in the first place.  If you're a good man, and your ground crew are good men, it's all you can ask for.

He adjusts the mix on the oxygen bottle he's carrying at his feet, breathing in preparation for the high-altitude flight. Up ahead, among a host of service vehicles, sits the U-2. \nINT. U-2 - DAY \nAnderson switches over to the U-2's oxygen supply as his NCOs belt him in.  They slap him on the helmet for good luck and lower the canopy as he brings his engines up to power. \nMAJOR ANDERSON This is flight G3132, requesting permission for take-off. \nTOWER VOICE (O.S.) G3132, you've got runway one, you are cleared to proceed to Angels 72. \nMAJOR ANDERSON Roger that. \nAnd he throws the throttle forward, \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. STRATOSPHERE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe twilight, in-between, world of the stratosphere.  Far below -- clouds, shining blue day.  Above, stars and the indigo depths of space.  We hang in utter silence. \nA silver glint appears in the center of the horizon.  It grows larger.  Then larger still.  It is the U-2.  We barely have time to register the rising hiss of its engines, when it FILLS THE SCREEN and BOOMS PAST, leaving us standing still. \nThe CAMERA PANS to follow it, but it's already dwindled to a speck, and we feel how fast 600 miles an hour really is. \nINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nAnderson's gloved hand reaches for the CAMERA HEATER switches. \nEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nThe belly door whines open like a silver eyelid, exposing the camera's lense. \nINT.

BAMABMABMABMA... The camera begins its photography. \nAnderson watches the number on the film-remaining counter spool down.  He stares out the window.  The towering clouds below rise up magnificent, glorious... a glimpse of heaven. \nRapt,  Anderson stares.  And then suddenly a BLARING ALARM GOES OFF IN THE COCKPIT.  It shocks Anderson around to the controls.  It's his MISSILE WARNING LIGHT. \nAnderson' hands flash out to the joystick, turning off the cameras, disabling autopilot.  He banks the U-2 hard. \nEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nAs the U-2 turns, far, far below, emerging from the clouds, barely visible, rises a CONTRAIL.  It arcs lazily toward us. A beat, and then another CONTRAIL. \nThen ANOTHER.  The anti-aircraft missiles creating them are too small to be seen with the naked eye. \nINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nThe cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights, the horizon outside tilted.  Anderson's breath comes fast, rasping as he does his strains going into the high-g turn. \nHe looks out the cockpit window, finds the first SA-2 missile in pursuit only several thousand feet below him now.  He waits. Waits.  Waits, still in the turn.  The black head of the missile now visible. \nHe puts the plane over, rolling out into an opposite bank. \nEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nThe spy plane's long flimsy wings weren't made for dogfighting.  They BEND terribly in the rollout.  And then the first missile STREAKS past, tries to correct its miss, but can't and vanishes into the distance at a 90-degree angle. \nINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nAnderson's breath comes faster and faster as the second missile rises up, now visible.  He puts the throttle as far as it goes, trying to outrun death.  Every second is a tenth of a mile, and every mile shortens the missile's life span. \nThe rising missile drafts aft, closing on the U-2 from behind. \nEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS \nThe second missile's contrail rises up behind the plane, levels off, and closes on it at a tremendous rate. \nThe third missile rises up in the far distance behind the second. \nThe second missile races up on the U-2, closer, right behind it, can't miss.

HALL OUTSIDE BUNDY'S OFFICE - DAY \nKenny, jogging down the hall, hears form an open door. \nBUNDY (O.S.) Kenny! \nKenny goes over to the threshold.  Inside the office Bundy stands up from behind his desk, grave.  And Kenny knows. \nINT. CABINET ROOM - DAY \nAll of EXCOM is there except for Bundy.  Kenny sits behind the President, deeply distraught over Major Anderson. \nTHE PRESIDENT Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets? \nGENERAL TAYLOR The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch. \nMCCONE Mr. President, taken with the events of the past few hours, I believe this confirms our worst fears.  We're now dealing with a hard-line Soviet government, perhaps with Khruschev as a puppet head, perhaps not. \nIn the silence, Kenny reads the faces around the room. They're convinced by McCone's pronouncement.  Kenny's not. \nKENNY It could be a mistake. \nMcCone gives him a get-serious look.  But Kenny presses on. \nKENNY (CONT'D) We need to be positive before we react. \nBundy enters the room.  Everyone looks up.  He stands there in the doorway, his face tight. \nKenny sags in his chair.  Bundy, of course, has more bad news, and they all know it.  A hopeless beat.  The President just stares at Bundy, unable to ask.  Bundy nods, affirming what everyone is thinking. \nBUNDY A U-2 on a routine air-sampling mission over Siberia got lost and penetrated Soviet airspace.  The Soviets scrambled MIGs in pursuit, thinking it was a bomber.  It got out okay.  Somebody forgot to cancel the mission. \nTHE PRESIDENT Goddammitt.  There's always some sonofabitch who doesn't get the word. All we need is the Soviets thinking we're bombing them. (facetious) Anybody else? \nThe humor falls on a cold audience. \nGENERAL TAYLOR Mr. President, our pilots are in danger. We must order punitive airstrikes against the SAM site that shot down Major Anderson per our rules of engagement. \nAnd finally the moment Kenny has dreaded all this time has come to pass.  He looks at Bobby, then at the President.  The President stares at the cup of coffee in his hands, as if trying to read the Fates' design in it.  A long beat, and everyone holds their breath. \nTHE PRESIDENT No.  I want confirmation there wasn't some sort of accident first. \nLeMay clears his throat.  Everyone looks at him, expecting him to scream or jump up and down. \nLEMAY I think that's a good idea, Mr. President.  It'll be safer for my boys to get those SAMs on Monday when we get the rest of the bastards.  I can wait a day and a half. \nTHE PRESIDENT Very well, then. \nBut he says it without any belief in the words, realizing they're being tied fast to the train tracks of war. \nINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY \nAlone in his office, shattered, Kenny stares out the window, viewing the distant Ellipse through a gap in the trees.  Kids are out there playing football.  He glances at his watch, and grabs his jacket. \nEXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY \nKenny puts on his jacket as he goes down the steps into the bright autumn day, walking away from the White House.  It drops behind him -- his step is faster, more urgent. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nKenny walks down the sidewalk, drawn toward the Ellipse.  The sixth grade FOOTBALL PLAYERS sweep forward with a running play.  Kenny scans them, searching, his breath coming hard. \nEXT. ELLIPSE - DAY \nHe reaches the edge of the open field.  And then he spots the name on the jersey: O'Donnell.  It's Kevin. The players relinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field. Kevin sees his dad. \nKEVIN Hey!  Dad! \nKenny manages a smile as Kevin trots over.  Kevin pulls his helmet off.  They stand there a long beat, Kenny desperate to take him up, abandon his post... but he doesn't. \nKENNY Hey, sport.  You winning? \nKEVIN Yeah. \nBut Kevin sees the turmoil in his father's face. \nKEVIN (CONT'D) Is everything going to be okay, Dad? \nKenny's forced smile is answer enough. \nKENNY Yeah, Kev.  Everything's gonna be fine. \nBut Kevin knows.  Together they know.

Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for? \nKENNY Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else. \nAnd Bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on Kenny - anguished, knowing his life is at its climax. \nBOBBY You know... I hate being called the brilliant one.  The ruthless one.  They guy who does the dirty work.  The one everybody's afraid of. \nKenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) I hate it.  I'm not smart, you know. And I'm not so ruthless. \nHe looks to Kenny, searching his face, then away, embarrassed. \nKENNY You're right about the smart part, but ruthless, well... \nThat breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene: \nTHROUGH THE WINDOW \nAppears the grim, square lines of the SOVIET EMBASSY.  Police cars line the streets outside it.  All the windows are dark. A cordon of KGB GUARDS in plainclothes stand by the gated entrance.  On the opposite side of the street lounge two dozen WASHINGTON D.C. POLICE. \nRESUME \nKenny gives Bobby a look.  Bobby rolls down his window. \nBOBBY Slow down.  Smell that? \nKENNY Smoke. \nBOBBY Just wanted to see for myself. (beat) They're burning their documents. \nThe final duty of an embassy before war... \nBOBBY (CONT'D) They think we're going to war.  G-d help us, Ken. \nEXT. SOVIET EMBASSY - NIGHT \nTHE CAMERA lifts away from the limo, turning toward the Embassy, past the Guards, past the brass plate which reads EMBASSY OF THE UNITED SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, up and up to the roof where black, reeking SMOKE billows from all of the Embassy's several chimneys. \nThe CAMERA races into it.  It engulfs us all. \nEXT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT \nKenny squeals the limo up to the curb in front of the Justice Department.  The doors fly open, and Kenny and Bobby jump out, head up the steps to the building. \nINT. HALL OUTSIDE BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nBobby's STAFFERS greet them as they stride down the hall, Staffer #1 taking Bobby's coat. \nSTAFFER #1 Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin is already here.  We have him waiting in your office. \nThey reach the double oak doors to Bobby's suite and stop. Bobby faces Kenny. \nKENNY I'll whistle up some luck for you. \nAnd before Kenny's eyes, all of Bobby's doubt vanishes.  In its place, a severe confidence.  A grandeur Kenny has never seen. \nIt makes Kenny pause.  He beholds his best friend become a man of the ages.  And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door. \nINT. BOBBY'S WAITING ROOM - NIGHT \nAnd a DOOR SHUTS OC like a threshold of history.  HOLD ON Bobby's waiting room.  Silent.  Cavernous.  Dim.  Plush carpet.  Heavy drapes framing dark windows.  And abandoned secretary's desk.  A row of sofas and chairs on either side of the room.  Two doorways, one at either end of the room. \nA WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors.  Dressed in gray.  Prim.  But beautiful.  A secretary of some sort. \nOne of the double doors to the hall swings silently open. Kenny glides in.  He sees the other door shut at the far end of the room.  Kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait. \nHOLD ON THE SCENE, motionless, silent. \nKenny WHISTLES two notes.  Stops.  And then he begins to WHISTLE the Irish tune, O'Donnell Aboo.  He gets a bar into it -- and there's a polite, soft COUGH. \nKenny stops.  Then notices the Woman in gray across the room. He didn't see her.  It's dim over there.  She looks at him, expressionless. \nThe CAMERA FINDS: a pin on her lapel.  A RED HAMMER AND SICKLE. \nKenny reacts.  Dobrynin's assistant?  His opposite number?  A friend?  Or more than a friend? \nHere is the face of the enemy.  Not a smile between them. Kenny resumes his ease.  And begins to WHISTLE again. \nThe haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling, filling the dim room.  Strange, sad, beautiful.  The woman listens.  And her face begins to soften. \nKenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his SONG striving to fill the empty room. \nKenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming... and the Woman's voice breaks in.  Kenny stops, looks over. Her voice is tremulous and beautiful.  Just a snatch of some song in Russian.  She stops, awkward. \nKenny stares.  The Woman stares back.  No smiles.  But in their eyes, they each see the other's fear, the other's beauty, the other's humanity. \nSo this is the enemy. \nTHE WOMAN Who are you? \nKenny glances to the door.  He considers for a long moment. \nKENNY The friend. \nKenny breaks the gaze.  He begins to whistle again.  The CAMERA drifts away, finding the far DOOR to the inner office, Kenny's tune stronger, carrying with it hope... \n", "test3_true": "... to the other side of that DOOR.  Dobrynin sits in a chair opposite Bobby behind his desk.  The room is equally dim. And far more tense. \nSilence.  And then the FAINTEST STRAIN of O'Donnell Aboo. Dobrynin glances briefly over his shoulder at the door. \nBut Bobby, unseen by Dobrynin, can't help the flicker of a private smile.  It's Kenny's presence, and Bobby is the stronger for it.  And then the tune is gone. \nBobby leans forward, cool, controlled, masterful. \nBOBBY Ambassador Dobrynin, we are aware that at this moment your missiles in Cuba are at the brink of operational readiness... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - CONTINUOUS \nFloodlights illuminate MISSILES, vertical on their erectors, support VEHICLES, clustered across the man-made clearing. \nMask-wearing Technicians wave a FUEL TRUCK back to the nearest missile.  Clouds of toxic VAPOR rise from the others. They've already been fueled. \nBOBBY (V.O.) They are a vital threat to my country. If launched, they would kill 80 million Americans. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. BOBBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nDobrynin listens impassively, as is his professional duty. \nBOBBY My brother, my friends, my countrymen and I cannot and will not permit those missiles to become operational. (beat) I promise you that. \nDobrynin looks out the window.  And then, pained, looks back at Bobby. \nDOBRYNIN Then I fear our two nations will go to war.  And I fear where war will lead us. \nBobby acknowledges him with a nod. \nBOBBY If the missiles do not become operational, if you remove the missiles, then there will be no war. (beat) At this moment, the President is accepting the terms of Secretary Khruschev's letter of Friday night.  If the Soviet Union halts construction immediately, removes the missiles, and submits to U.N. inspection, the United States will pledge to never invade Cuba or aid others in that enterprise. \nDobrynin stares at Bobby.  Stares hard. \nDOBRYNIN If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey were removed also, such an accommodation could be reached. \nThe two men move their argument forward with the deliberation and formality of chess masters. \nBOBBY (tired sounding) The United States cannot agree to such terms under threat.  Any belief to the contrary -- (beat) -- was in error. \nDobrynin reels internally.  The only sign on his face is a slight tremor.  Bobby looks up, registers the calculated effect.  And to Dobrynin's horror, the Russian believes: \nDOBRYNIN You want war... \nBut not so fast.  Bobby folds his hands.  And he smoothly goes from hard-ass brinksman to sensitive deal-maker. \nBOBBY However, while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue, the United States can offer a private assurance. \nDobrynin holds his breath. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey are obsolete, and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time.  This withdrawal should be completed within, say, six months. \nDobrynin lets out his breath. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Of course, any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government. \nDobrynin grasps the move immediately, understanding the ramifications.  Still he hesitates a moment. \nDOBRYNIN This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority? \nBOBBY Yes. \nDOBRYNIN And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government \nBOBBY Of course.  Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy. \nMeaning this is the bone he can show the hard line.  Dobrynin struggles internally, knowing what Bobby has done, wanting to hug him.  It comes across as agitation. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form. (beat) And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest.  I cannot stress this point enough. \nDOBRYNIN Tomorrow... \nBOBBY Tomorrow... \nDobrynin rises from his chair.  Bobby rises with him. \nDOBRYNIN Then you must excuse me and permit me to relay the substance of our discussion to my superiors. \nDobrynin heads for the door.  Half way there he turns back to Bobby, deeply moved.  Deeply grateful. \nDOBRYNIN (CONT'D) We have heard stories that some among your military men wish for war. (beat) You are a good man.  Your brother is a good man.  I assure you there are other good men.  Let us hope the will of good men is enough to counter the terrible strength of this thing which has been put in motion. \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT \nKenny enters the Oval Office through his side door.  The office is dark, only the desk lamp on.

RICK You bet your ass you've been blowing me off. 
STEVEN It's just, this guy is really doing a number on me. 
RICK I told you not to hang out with him. 
STEVEN You're the one who told me to offer him money so I could get free cable. 
RICK You didn't tell me he was a psychopath. (beat) I'll see if I can get my friend in research to track him down. What's his name again? 
STEVEN Ernie Douglas. 
RICK Ernie Douglas? Ernie Douglas? Why does that sound so familiar? 
81	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY 
Steven's secretary Joan is watching a news report about the Sam Sweet trial on a mini television. 
On the TV - a Female Prosecutor gestures with a shotgun as she questions a policeman. 
Joan changes channels. The image changes to LARRY KING interviewing ALAN DERSHOWITZ regarding "the abuse excuse." 
BACK TO SCENE 
Steven walks over to Joan. 
STEVEN (to his secretary) Did anyone notice I'm late? 
JOAN What are you talking about, you've been here for an hour. 
STEVEN Thank you. 
Steven walks to his office. 
81A	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Steven walks behind his desk. He notices something which disturbs him. His computer is on. He clicks a button and a message comes on the screen. 
ON THE SCREEN - "GOOD MORNING STEVEN. HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. HERE'S AN EXTRA SPECIAL SURPRISE." 
Then an image comes on the screen. It is black and white surveillance video, digitized to the computer format. The video is of Robin and Steven talking. It is the conversation they had before they watched "Sleepless in Seattle." 
STEVEN Work's good. 
ROBIN How's Hal? 
STEVEN Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless. 
ROBIN It's just great that you're getting to do it. It's a real step up. 
STEVEN I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done. 
The sccene starts again. It is on a loop. Steven is aghast. He looks up and sees the scene is playing on every computer in the office. He gets a panicked look on his face. Is Hal seeing this? He runs out of his office to prevent Hal from viewing this. 
81B	OFFICE BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS 
Steven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down. 
STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees Hal downstairs, walking into his office. 
BACK TO STEVEN - He runs down the stairs towards Hal's office as fast as he can. 
81C	INT. HAL'S OFFICE 
Steven walks in. Hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer. He looks up and sees Steven. 
HAL Don't worry. I didn't see it --- 'cause I have no vision. 
Steven knows what's coming. 
82	OMITTED 
82A	OMITTED 
82B	OMITTED 
82C	INT. PARKING GARAGE - LATER 
Steven walks to his car carrying a box filled with his belongings. He has been fired. Suddenly a car alarm beeps. It's headlights flash. Then another, and another. Soon he is surrounded by screaming car alarms, and flashing headlights. He looks around in fear.

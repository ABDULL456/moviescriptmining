WILLS So? 
JOHN So after the party, no thank you! I call you three times -- no call back! And for six days you don't even eat at your own god damn restaurant! What am I supposed to think? Huh?! I was ready to call the morgue! 
WILLS Relax, I'm alive. 
JOHN Well, you sure don't look it! 
EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTE LATER 
John walks as quickly as he can with Wills struggling to keep up -- 
JOHN I'll tell you why it's my concern! Because I had a god damn swimming pool! An ocean view! A fabulous lemon tree hangin' right over my Jacuzzi! And I gave it up for you, brother! Back to a life of concrete and dirt and sirens just so you could get your shit together! 
EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTES LATER 
John, walking a little more slowly now, cannot believe his ears -- 
JOHN On my roof? You gotta be kiddin'! Not on my green chair! Tell me it wasn't on the green chair. 
Wills winces. 
JOHN Oh, great. Now how am I gonna clean that? 
EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTE LATER 
John walks slowly now, backward, listening to an anxious Wills -- 
WILLS Look, it doesn't matter that she's sick -- she's still a kid and there's no way we should be together. It's unhealthy... it's... it's inappropriate... 
JOHN (with disgust) What the hell is that? Some sorta shrink talk? 
WILLS Look, if she were just fun... just some sort of diversion... maybe I could justify it. But the worst part is that it's becoming more. Much more. It's embarrassing how much I like her. She gets to me. She affects me... 
He stops and leans back against a building. He looks around, avoiding eye contact with John, as tears rise into his eyes. 
WILLS And she's gonna be gone and... I'm not sure I can... I mean... I already think about her all the time... (fighting tears) Her smile kills me... and the thought... that it'll be gone... forever... that I'll never see her again... I don't know... I can't -- I don't think I'm that strong, Johnny. It's too much. I'd rather have it be over... over now. I'll start missing her now. 
Wills is still unable to look at him. John speaks softly -- 
JOHN Buddy, I hate to break it to you, but in the real world... where I live... there're only two kindsa love stories. Boy loses girl and girl loses boy. That's all there is. Somebody always gets left behind. You try to avoid that, you'll end up an old man toastin' yourself with egg nog in the mirror on Christmas Eve. You'll end up dying in your own arms. 
Wills lifts his frightened eyes. John pats him on the cheek. 
EXT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT 
Wills stands with Patty in the driveway in front of the glass lobby. He is distracted and terribly anxious. She looks as though she expects, at the very least, a kiss -- 
PATTY Thank you so much. I had such a great time. 
WILLS Good. I'm... I'm glad. 
PATTY Didn't you? 
WILLS Patty, I... I want to be honest with you... right now, from the start... so there's no room for misunderstanding. I didn't have a good time, but it's nothing personal. I just split up with someone and rather than admit to myself how much I miss her, I asked you out instead. And it's unfair. If I feel sad I should just feel sad and not try to use you... and your body... as some sort of painkiller, right? (beat) Anyway, I think you're a warm and engaging woman and I wish you all the best. 
Relieved to have unburdened himself of the truth, he shakes her hand. Patty, utterly baffled, doesn't know what hit her. 
EXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- LATER 
The doorman Michael, smoking a cigarette, sees Wills walk up, his expression pensive. 
MICHAEL Mr. Keane -- 
WILLS Good night, Michael. 
MICHAEL You've got a visitor. 
Wills stops and turns -- 
WILLS Who? 
MICHAEL She's been waitin' almost an hour. In the lobby. (off Wills' look) A little surprise for ya. 
He winks. Wills realizes that it's Charlotte. It must be. He smiles and hurries inside. 
INT. WILLS' LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS 
Wills bursts in and freezes. A WOMAN stands across the way, studying an oil painting. She turns quickly. It's LISA. She sees his excited expression fall. Beneath her rather composed facade, Lisa is a chaos of conflicting emotions -- 
LISA Sorry to disappoint you. 
WILLS No, no. Not at all. You surprised me, that's all. I didn't expect to see you... not here... not after your letter. 
LISA Well, I didn't expect you to show up at my job. 
WILLS I followed you in. I wasn't even sure it was you. All I have is an old snapshot.

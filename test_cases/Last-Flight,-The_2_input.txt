FRINK I-- Well-- 
During the above dialogue, Bill nudges Cary mischievously and they glance down at the tray in front of them. They exchange knowing nods, pick up some drinks, bring them over, and offer one to Frink. 
BILL Have a drink? 
FRINK No, thanks. 
SHEP Cure the shakes. 
FRINK I haven't got the shakes. 
CARY Let's see. Hold out your hands. 
Bill and Shep watch with interest as Frink holds out his hands, palms up. 
CARY No, turn them over. 
Frink turns them over, palms down. Cary looks at Frink's steady hands, impressed. 
CARY Say, that's pretty good. 
Cary looks down at the drink in his own hand. 
CARY Let's see if you can hold this. 
Cary sets the glass on top of Frink's downturned hand. Frink balances the full glass with ease. 
CARY Say, that's great. 
Cary places a second full glass on Frink's other hand. Frink balances both glasses with ease. Cary expresses keen admiration. 
CARY Steady as a rock! 
Frink looks at the others, a little smugly. Cary slowly backs away and walks off, as do the others. Frink's face falls as he realizes he has been left standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his hands and no way to safely remove them. 
Cary, Shep and Bill return to Nikki and crowd around her. 
CARY Well, I guess that'll keep his hands out of mischief for a while. 
Frink, abandoned, reluctantly pleads with the others. 
FRINK Hey. Take these off. 
But the others simply ignore him. 
CARY Now, let's see. Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted? 
BILL We were talkin' about Nikki's legs. 
CARY That's right. We were talkin' about Nikki's legs. And havin' a fine time, too. 
The Asian maid who has been working on Nikki's feet abruptly rises. 
WOMAN Finis. 
The men cheer, "Yay!" and Nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her tools. The men crowd closer to peer down at Nikki's legs. 
SHEP Let's inspect the job. 
But Nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand. 
NIKKI Oh, my poor toes. Don't look too close. 
Nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body. Since she's no longer using her footstool, Cary commandeers it and sits on it. 
CARY Well, what's the matter with your toes? 
Nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story -- very slowly. Her eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness. 
NIKKI Well... when I was a little girl... 
A worried look crosses Cary's face. 
NIKKI ... my mother bought me a new pair of shoes. ... And they were WAY too short. ... 
Shep and Bill listen soberly. 
NIKKI ... And I had to walk all the way to Sunday school and back. ... Down the road. ... And it was hot and dusty. 
BILL (hand to his face) Oh, take her away! She's breakin' my heart! (sobs) 
NIKKI And when I got home ...  my toes were spoiled. 
CARY (on the verge of tears) Oh, dear, oh, dear.

He is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog. 
TATIANA (CONT'D) Oh, my God, it's Victor. Why do they want Victor? 
They watch as Victor is beaten to the jeep. At this point Victor looses it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging, screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to die. It's a horror. 
TATIANA (CONT'D) Do something. 
PAUL What? 
TATIANA Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake. 
PAUL Please, be quiet. 
Tatiana, moves toward the gate handle. 
TATIANA I'm going to talk to them. 
Paul grabs her. 
PAUL No. 
TATIANA We must do something. 
Paul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house. 
PAUL What would you have us do? Argue with these madmen? We cannot interfere. 
INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Thomas and Fedens wait, anxious, as Paul appears. 
PAUL You better stay the night, it is too dangerous to be on the streets. 
Tatiana hides her anger. 
TATIANA I'll fix a bed. 
INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Paul lies in bed unable to sleep.   The clock reads 3:00 am. 
TATIANA Why didn't you call your contacts in the army? 
PAUL I couldn't help. 
TATIANA You could have asked for a favor. 
PAUL No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals? All day long I work to please this officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help I have powerful people I can call upon. Now you would have me waste a precious favor on a stranger. 
TATIANA Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor. 
PAUL He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us? 
TATIANA They do not have your connections. 
PAUL Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment. 
His turn away indicates the discussion is over. 
EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. MORNING 
Paul's car rolls up to the hotel's guard house. 
SUPER THE TITLE: APRIL 6th, 1994. 
An army jeep is parked just inside. General Bizimungu is in the passenger seat, talking into a walkie-talkie. 
The General gives an I'll see you soon wave. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY 
The hotel entrance is a mini-jam of airport buses, white UN jeeps, foreign news crew Land Rovers, and a TV repair van unloading monitors. Paul marches in, past Zozo the bell hop, who helps the TV men unload. 
PAUL Welcome, gentlemen. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
The lobby buzzes with activity. At the reception, Gregoire is surrounded by a BBC news crew: GLORIA, young, chic female reporter/producer, and JOCK, tough, experienced Scottish cameraman, and his local sound guy Peter. Gloria is upset. 
GLORIA We reserved five rooms not two 
GREGOIRE I'm sorry, ma'am, but I see only two here in the computer. 
Jock sees Paul. 
JOCK Paul, how the hell are ya'? 
PAUL I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish. 
JOCK They moved you from the Diplomat? 
PAUL Promoted. House Manager. 
JOCK Good for you. 
(moves closer) We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but... 
Paul moves behind the desk. 
PAUL Let me check. 
He punches into the computer. 
PAUL Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people instead of BBC Gregoire.

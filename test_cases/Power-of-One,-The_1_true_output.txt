ST. JOHN Yes it does. But it is never kind to those who try to hurry it. 
PK I feel we should resist, sir. 
ST. JOHN So do I, P.K. But this is not a subtle government. They mean to have their way and damn the consequences. And I cannot jeopardize this school, no matter how I personally feel. I'm sorry. (beat) I heard you were accepted at Oxford. 
MORRIE Yes, sir.   Received notification today. 
ST. JOHN Well, congratulations. 
MORRIE Thank you, sir. 
St. John looks at PK who remains silent. 
ST. JOHN To both of you. 
PK (tight) Thank you, sir. 
An uncomfortable silence lingers. ST. JOHN We'll talk before you go. 
PK Yes, sir.   Will that be all? 
ST. JOHN That'll be all. 
PK turns immediately and exits.     Morrie and St. John trade an uncomfortable look.

PK walks down the hall, anger building in his face.       He exits the hall. 
CUT TO:

PK comes up to the main gate.     A GUARD stops him. PK I'd like to see Maria Marais please. 
The Guard checks his list. 
GUARD Sorry. She's not allowed visitors. PK Well, if I could just talk to her. 
GUARD Sorry. 
PK backs away and moves off down the street.     He turns the corner.

Morrie is asleep.   PK wakes him. 
PK Morrie.   Morrie. 
MORRIE What? 
PK I want to show you something. 
MORRIE What time is it? 
He looks at his watch and turns over. 
MORRIE Can I see it later? 
PK No.   Come on. 
He pulls Morrie out of bed.     Morrie groggily starts pulling his clothes on. 
MORRIE You know, when we get to Oxford -- separate rooms. 
PK Will you hurry. 
MORRIE Is there some girl out there waiting for me? PK Yeah. Stunning. Breasts like casabas. Just waiting for you. 
MORRIE Bullshit. 
PK throws a jersey into his chest and pulls him out of the room. 
CUT TO: 
145   EXT. PRINCE OF WALES CAMPUS                                145 
The campus is swaddled in early morning fog. 
PK and Morrie stand on the side of the school chapel while a black groundsman opens the door to the basement. 
PK What do you think? MORRIE I think you're fooling yourself into thinking the bastards won't 
come after us in here.

HOOKER I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it. 
Snyder and his partner disappear around a corner.  Hooker suddenly takes off like a shot. 
INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT 
He runs into a drugstore and goes to the phone booth. There's already a woman in it.  Hooker rips open the door and throws her out.  Hurriedly, he begins to dial. 
EIRIE KID (standing outside the booth) What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid. 
HOOKER (waiting for the ring) Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's. 
EIRIE KID Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but... 
Hooker, still getting no answer, slams the phone down and blasts out of the booth. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Eirie chases him frantically, calling him to come back, but he's giving away too many years and there's no stopping Hooker at this point.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT - SHOTS OF HOOKER 
Pumping down the street. 
EXT. LUTHER'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
Hooker races into Luther's brownstone, charges up to the third floor. 
INT. LUTHER'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
Hooker runs up through a small group of people on the stairs. He bursts into Luther's room, the door of which is already open.  The room shows signs of a struggle, a turned-over chair, a broken lamp, but there is no Coleman.  Hooker goes slowly to the window.  He looks down into the courtyard and then suddenly sprints back out the door.  As we hear him scrambling down the stairs, the camera dollies to the window and looks out. 
EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT 
There on the concrete below, face down, is the body of Luther Coleman.  Hooker races out to it and kneels down. 
HOOKER (shaking the body) C'mon Luther, get up.  You gotta get up, Luther. 
In the distance, sirens are heard.  Heads are out of the windows and some people are starting to gather in the courtyard. 
HOOKER (CONT'D) Goddamn you, Luther, will you get up? (pounding on the body) I'm not waitin' for you, Luther. I'm not waitin' anymore.  Get up, you son of a bitch.  Goddamn you, Luther, goddamn. 
The sirens are close now, and Hooker tears himself away from Luther and runs.  The others gather to look at the body. 
FADE OUT.

INT. THE TRAIN STATION - DAY 
We open on Hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the station, covered with newspapers for warmth, and barely distinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him.  A station security officer, on his morning sweep, wanders by and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of Hooker's feet with a nightstick.  Hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain, as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping victim. 
Tired and sore from his night in the station, Hooker struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the situation.  He tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit, but it's futile.  A quick check of his wallet finds it as empty as he'd remembered it. 
CUT TO: 
THE STATION - GIFT SHOP - DAY 
Hooker walks in and goes to the toy section.  He looks through several small novelties, till he finds what he's looking for -- a little tin replica of a policeman's badge. He looks around for station detectives, and seeing none, slips the badge into his pocket. 
CUT TO: 
THE STATION - WASHROOM - DAY 
Hooker rinses out his mouth, towels off his face and slicks his hair back with water.  It's a drop in the bucket, but it seems to revitalize him a little.

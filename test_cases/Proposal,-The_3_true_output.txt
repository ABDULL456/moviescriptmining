Inside, the elegant party carries on. 
DEBBIE Where's Margaret?   We need to go. 
RICHARD Go where? 
DEBBIE It's a surprise.   Girls are going into town. And the boys stay here.   I told you, we've planned everything. 
RICHARD Um.   She's outside. Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window. They see Margaret running with Balzac above her head. 
DEBBIE Oh that's sweet, she's playing with my Balzac. 
EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY 
The eagle is long gone, but Margaret is still running with the dog trying to bait it back. 
MARGARET This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle.   C'mon, bring back the phone. Richard calls out from the house. 
RICHARD What are you doing? 
MARGARET The eagle took my phone! 
RICHARD Are you drunk? 
MARGARET Your dad was right!   The eagle tried to take the dog, so I saved it, then it came back and took my phone. 
RICHARD Did the dingo eat your baby, too? 
MARGARET Frank's going to call me on that phone.   I need it! 
RICHARD Relax.   I've got your information backed up on the laptop.   I'll just get you a new phone and switch the number.   No problem. 
MARGARET Oh. 
RICHARD Now come on.   You're going somewhere with my mom and the girls. 
MARGARET I'm not going anywhere. 
RICHARD You want a new phone?   You're going. 
EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAY 
The Pioneer bar is a classic Alaskan bar, decorated with pictures of every fishing vessel that has made Sitka its home. But tonight estrogen rules, as all the patrons are women CHEERING for an oiled, toned, and BEARDED MAN in a tiny thong who gyrates to the beat of Prince's "Sexy Motherfucker."   On stage with the dancer, Margaret tries to not look miserable in her NOVELTY 
BACHELORETTE PARTY WEDDING VEIL WITH DEVIL HORNS. 
DEBBIE Work it Hank! 
GERTRUDE Is that a salmon down your pants? The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from Margaret's face.   Margaret remains straight faced. 
MARGARET Definitely not a salmon. The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his wiggling ass and gives her a feel.   She can't help but give and embarrassed smile.   Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the splits.   Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation. Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek.   She begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand. 
HANK Ah, ah, ah.   I was just the warm up. Hank sits Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf. 
MARGARET What's going on? 
GRANDMA ANNIE Just sit there dear. 
MC Don't be shy ladies, tip well and often, show Hank how much you appreciate his assets!   And now... Ramone! The room goes silent as a middle aged RAMONE comes on to the stage.   He has a pot belly, threadbare thong and a thin mustache. Ramone's dance has a Latin theme to it, and he's very good at it. Margaret is oblivious. 
MARGARET What's that smell? Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about an inch away from her face. MARGARET (cont'd) (belly laugh) Ahhh!!! Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone. After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger at her naughty behavior. 
RAMONE You are a naughty devil. Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns, Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies. 
MARGARET Good lord. 
GRANDMA ANNIE Ramone was the only male dancer on the island for years. No one has the heart to tell him to hang it up.

MOLLY Are you okay? 
KIRK (O.S.) Yeah, fine. 
INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN 
Kirk runs the water while he digs under the sink. He finds duct tape. He pulls some tape off the roll. It makes a loud noise that causes Molly to pause and Kirk to tense up. Kirk opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble-spot. He coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll. 
MOLLY (O.S.) I just think we should get to know each other first.   I'm no prude. I mean, I'm pretty generous in bed. Once I trust a person, I like to experiment and get pretty wild. 
KIRK Oh, dear God. 
MOLLY (O.S.) But, I just need to feel safe first. 
Kirk finishes taping up, zips his pants and checks his profile in the reflection from the window. 
INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT 
Kirk returns with two glasses of water and no visible boner. 
KIRK Hey.   I'm totally fine with that. 
MOLLY You're the best. 
Kirk gives an "aw-shucks" head tilt.    Molly stands. 
MOLLY (CONT'D) Okay, well, I'd better go then. 
They walk to the door. Molly leans in and they kiss a few moments more. Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little snug. She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to retrieve them. Suddenly she starts coughing. She puts her fist over her mouth. 
Kirk's POV:   As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch. 
Kirk winces again. She hears the tape start to give way. She looks up, slightly confused. Kirk looks around as though he's looking for the source of the sound. Molly stands. 
MOLLY (CONT'D) I had a really nice time.    I'll call you tomorrow. 
KIRK Great! 
Kirk opens the door for Molly. 
EXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT 
As Molly exits, she gives him one last kiss. Two studly male college students are playing foosball on their patio. They stop when one points out the hottie who's kissing Kirk. Molly trots off. 
COLLEGE STUDENT #1 Damn, man!     That chick is fine! 
Kirk returns a cool "whassup" nod to the guys. 
COLLEGE STUDENT #2 All right Mr. Kettner! 
COLLEGE STUDENT #1 You wanna play some foos!? 
KIRK No thanks fellas. 
Kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside. 
INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT 
He drifts over to his piano and sits down. The joy of what has just happened is plastered on his face. He launches into a furiously happy Jerry Lee Lewis style romp. Soon a neighbor is pounding on the wall. Kirk stops playing. 
KIRK Sorry, Mrs. Neusbaum! 
Kirk continues his celebration, dancing around the apartment. He picks up the picture of Marnie and speaks to it. 
KIRK (CONT'D) Ron seems like a swell guy. I love Pizza Hut. What? Who's this? Why, this is my girlfriend, Molly. Oh, don't be that way. Oh, there, there, now. Here's a tissue. 
He drops the picture and continues the dance. 
INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. The smile continues as he drifts off to sleep. Time lapses as Kirk sleeps and the sun comes up. Still smiling, his eyes open like a shot and he reaches for his phone - "No Missed Calls." 
MONTAGE OVER MUSIC: 
1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom.   He checks his gut and hairline in the mirror. 
2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the box. It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached along with a card that reads, "Happy Graduation - Love Mom and Dad." He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads the directions. The parts are spread out all over the floor. He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses underneath him. He checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."

The procedure is completely automated. The passengers are all confused. Helpless to stop it. 
INT. LIDO DECK 
The passengers glide in by the thousands. Form concentric circles over the closed-up pools. Fill the multi-storied balconies on all sides. 
ON JOHN AND MARY 
They arrive together at the Lido Deck. Mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying. A NANNY-BOT tries vainly to placate them. 
NANNY-BOT Remain calm. Remain calm. 
CLOSE ON BRIDGE PLAZA 
The BNL LOGO on the floor rotates. A large cylindrical device rises from the stage... 
...The ship's HOLO-DETECTOR. 
JUMBOTRONS activate on the dome. Show the bridge. Everyone can see the Captain wrestling Auto. He tries to speak to them during the fight: 
CAPTAIN (strained; in command) Ladies and Gentlemen! This is your Captain speaking! We're having a slight malfunction with the Autopilot! Please remain calm! 
The passengers get caught up in the conflict. Treat it as if it were a televised fight. 
ON THE REAR OF THE DECK 
Eve and Wall-E fly out of the transport tunnel. Make a beeline for the holo-detector. Ready and waiting for the plant... 
...almost there... 
ON BRIDGE 
AUTO Enough. 
Auto furiously spins his wheel. Throws the Captain to the floor. The entire ship lists dangerously to one side. 
ON LIDO DECK 
Eve and Wall-E slam into the holo-detector's side. Wall-E drops the plant. It tumbles off the bridge plaza. Eve is forced to set Wall-E down. 
He clings to the holo-detector. She flies off to retrieve the plant. 
The hover chairs stay locked on their lines. Passengers all slip off their chairs. Their uniform color defaults back to RED. Slowly slide across the deck. And for the first time... ...all of humanity reaches out to one another. CLOSE UPS of hands holding hands. 
Everyone piles up on the listing side. The plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity. Eve searches desperately amongst them. 
ON JOHN & MARY 
They hang together off their chairs. CRYING TODDLERS just above them. The kiddies slip out of their hover rings. Mary GASPS in horror. Yells to John: 
MARY John, get ready to have some kids! 
They purposefully let go of their chairs. Grab hands, forming a human chain. Catch the toddlers. All slide together down the Lido Deck. The TODDLERS GIGGLE the whole way down. They land at the bottom, next to Eve. 
An empty monorail car tips off the upper deck... ...lands on the pool level. It begins sliding down the Lido Deck. Smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake. 
MARY (Gasp) LOOK OUT! 
Eve looks   up. Sees the Monorail sliding towards them. She stops   the car before it hits. Struggles   to hold it up. Can't let   it crush the passengers below her. 
ON BRIDGE 
Auto keeps the ship tilted. Glides over to the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON. Switches it off.

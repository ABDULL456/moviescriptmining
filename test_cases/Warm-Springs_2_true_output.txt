A few feet away -- also in a world of his own -- sits Louis, overdressed for summer in a three piece suit. An overflowing ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his feet. 
He holds up a paper to Eleanor with the photo of Franklin and the Boy Scouts. 
LOUIS He's a natural. 
Eleanor gives it a cursory glance then looks out to where Franklin and the children come bounding up the lawn. 
Franklin and Elliot break out from the rest and begin racing up the lawn. Franklin, no match for his son's speed, loses. He doubles over, trying to catch his breath. 
ELLIOT Vae victis! ("Woe to the conquered!") C aught up in his victory, Elliot doesn't see Franklin sneak up behind him and tackle him to the ground. 
FRANKLIN Festina lente! ("Not so fast!") 
One by one the other children all pile on top of Franklin and Elliot. 
ELEANOR Dinner is in one half-hour! Come in and change, children! 
FRANKLIN Up! Up, chicks! You heard your mother! 
Everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except Franklin. 
ELEANOR Go wash up. 
Utterly spent, Franklin lays on the grass, not moving. 
LOUIS Hey, boss! Are you all right? 
Slowly, Franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the porch stairs. 
FRANKLIN I'm fine. (re: her knitting) Oh, that's pretty, Babs. 
He puts his hand on Eleanor's shoulder and leans in to buss her cheek but Eleanor quickly stands. 
ELEANOR I must check on dinner. 
There is a cursory formality to her words and little warmth. 
FRANKLIN Very well. 
She goes into the house. Louis then hands Franklin letters. 
LOUIS Tired? 
FRANKLIN Of you? Never. 
Wearily, he sorts through the envelopes. 
LOUIS Why don't you nap before dinner? 
FRANKLIN Yes, dear. 
Franklin heads into the house leaning heavily against the screen door struggling for control. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SUN ROOM - DAY Franklin lays on a chaise being examined by a DOCTOR, who leans over him holding out his hand. 
DOCTOR Can you take my hand? 
Franklin tries, but can't. Almost his entire body is paralyzed. He can only breathe and blink. 
The Doctor glances at Eleanor, Louis and Sara indicating they should follow him out. 
EXT. SCREENED PORCH - DAY As the door from the sun room opens onto the porch, Elliot is there waiting. Seeing them coming, he dashes off into the yard so as not to be seen as Eleanor, Louis, Sara and the Doctor enter. 
DOCTOR He has Infantile Paralysis. Polio. 
Sara sinks into a chair. 
SARA I knew it. I knew it.

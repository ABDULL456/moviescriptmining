MAPP That's why it's a stone, you know, It means Don't Come Back. 
STARLING NODS, AND THEY TURN AWAY, AND WALK AWAY FROM THE GRAVE.  IN THE BG WE SEE ANOTHER GROUP OF MOURNERS, WEARING WESTERN GARB.  STARLING AND HER GROUP CROSS A SERVICE ROAD, IN FRONT OF THE OLD TRUCK. 
STARLING Well.  No.  He can't come back. 
MAPP Baby, that's the beginning of wisdom. 
MAPP PUTS HER ARM AROUND STARLING, AS THEY WALK OFF. STARLING NODS, THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS, AND LAYS HER HEAD ON MAPP'S SHOULDER. 
WE SEE SEVERAL GRAVEDIGGERS SITTING ON THE BACK.  THE MAN IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, WEARING A STRAW WESTERN HAT, TURNS, TO LOOK AT STARLING AND THE GROUP.  IT LOOKS LIKE LECHTER.

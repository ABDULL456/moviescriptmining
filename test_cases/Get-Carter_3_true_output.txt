CARTER (smiling) And what was that? 
GLENDA We're there now. 
She brakes to a split-second stop. 
INT. PENTHOUSE RESTAURANT - DAY 
It's one large empty concrete box with big picture windows all the way round. Wires are hanging from the ceiling and walls where the lights will eventually be fixed. 
A tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting sun. He is just a silhouette. 
Carter and Glenda enter and walk towards the man. The silhouette turns as he nears it. It's Brumby. 
BRUMBY A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant. (pause) Do you like it? 
CARTER Yes. 
BRUMBY Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming, (pause) It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother? (pause) I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back, (pause) You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother, (pause) One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs. (pause) So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit, (pause) So I'm worried. I can't fight them Â— I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead. 
Brumby picks up a black briefcase. He holds it up to Carter. 
BRUMBY Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you. 
CARTER What name? 
BRUMBY Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. (pause) Kinnear did it. 
CARTER Why? 
BRUMBY I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead. 
CARTER Why? 
BRUMBY I don't know. That's all I was told. 
Carter takes a last look at Glenda and walks slowly back towards the entrance. 
CARTER That's not good enough. 
BRUMBY Christ, what... 
CARTER (shouting) Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so? (pause) Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on. 
BRUMBY Jack, you're wrong. 
CARTER Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits. 
BRUMBY Jack... 
EXT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY 
Carter steps out of the elevator as Glenda's Sunbeam comes down the bottom ramp fast. The car brakes hard and stops. Carter opens the door and gets in. Not a word is said. 
INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The apartment is one of many in a modern block and Glenda has only recently moved in. There is a mattress on the floor. A large mirror leans against the wall behind it and a film projector stands close to the window, which has makeshift curtains. 
Carter and Glenda are on the mattress. The bedding is all over the place. They have just finished fucking. 
CARTER (looking around) Who's setting you up in this place? 
GLENDA Brumby. 
CARTER Is he coming here?

{"train": "CONAN THE BARBARIAN \nWritten by \nThomas Dean Donnelly & Joshua Oppenheimer \nBased on the writings of \nRobert E. Howard \nOctober 7, 2009 \nOVER BLACK: \nIn the darkness, we hear the solitary sound of a HEARTBEAT, resounding like a drum. \nNARRATOR (V.O) In between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles under the stars. Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a king born of battle. \nMuffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: CLANGING swords, the guttural CRIES of combat. \nUNBORN BABY \nEyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb. \nSuddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its tip not an inch from the baby's head. \nAs the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we travel with it, into the DIN of BATTLE. \nEXT. CIMMERIA - MUDDY FIELD - DAY \nA blonde-haired, armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody sword from the stomach of ISLENE, a wild-maned Cimmerian beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody stomach. \nAcross a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS, until he spots Islene. \nCORIN Islene!!! \nWielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, Corin cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never leaving Islene. \nThe Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the earth behind her, trying to pull herself away. \nAESIR Now, now little whore. Did I get you or your little one? \nIslene's hand reaches back once again -- and it finds a fallen warrior's SWORD. In one fluid motion she swings the sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the Aesir's armor -- at his groin. \nISLENE I'd ask you the same. \nThe Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him. \nCorin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands back they are coated in blood. \nTheir eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand. \nISLENE (CONT'D) Take your child. \nCORIN I cannot. \nIslene looks to her naked belly. The baby inside presses against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh. \nISLENE There is no time, husband. I would see my child's face. \nIslene's eyes flutter as she struggles. Corin lowers the knife. Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife to use. Never once does she scream. \nA moment later, Corin lifts the crying, blood-covered BOY up through the falling snowflakes to Islene's lap. \nISLENE (CONT'D) A boy. He will be strong. A warrior with no equal. \nCORIN Do not speak, love. \nISLENE You have never been able to still my tongue, and you will not this day. He will be wild, Corin. You must temper him. \nShe shares one kiss with her child, its first taste not of mother's milk, but of her blood. \nISLENE (CONT'D) (FADING) Conan. His--name--is--Conan. \nCONAN \nThe boy's eyes are as deep and blue as the Eastern Sea. \nConan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered in Pict blood. Three PICTS lie massacred, the bodies hacked to pieces. \nCORIN (CONT'D) What have you done, boy? \nConan walks past the other stunned Cimmerians, up to his father. Conan SPITS OUT the bloody stone from his mouth. \nCONAN They killed one. I killed three. I am a warrior now. \nUran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances. Looking at the carved up bodies of the Picts, they are aghast. Conan looks confused. Why aren't they happy? \nCORIN A warrior? What you have done a jackal would do. Never a warrior. \nCONAN They would have done the same -- \nCORIN As I said, jackals. (TO URAN) He is not ready. I will forge him myself. \nCUT TO: \nTRAINING MONTAGE: \nConan is tested under Corin's watchful eye: \n- Forced to sleep in the snow, while his father keeps warm inside. \n- A heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances on wet river rocks. \n- Climbing a cliff face, his bare hands leaving blood behind on the jagged rocks. \nINT. CIMMERIAN FORGE - DAY \nFlames reflect in the blue eyes of Conan as he works the bellows of the forge. Sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he stokes the blaze. \nCorin sharpens a sword, perfecting it. Conan cannot take his eyes off it, stepping away from the bellows. \nCORIN Stoke your fire, boy. \nConan slams the bellows closed, anger rising. \nCONAN \"Stoke your fire, chop your wood.\" I have slept where wolves dare not. I have balanced a thousand river stones. When will you teach me the sword? \nCorin stares his son in the eyes. Judging. \nCORIN Think you're ready? Then tell me: what is a sword's purpose? \nCONAN To slay ones enemies. \nCORIN No. That is what it does. Its purpose is why you use it. \nHe tosses Conan two lumps of ore. \nCORIN (CONT'D) Tell me, which makes the best sword? \nConan takes the two lumps, testing them. He hands his father back one. \nCORIN (CONT'D) The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall make a sword of it, and tomorrow you will show me what brute strength yields. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - DUSK \nWith a setting sun silhouetting the two, Conan attacks Corin. Conan attacks with fury. Corin defends with grace. Until the boy overextends and Corin slashes down a counterattack that SHATTERS CONAN'S SWORD. \nCorin simply turns and walks away, leaving Conan to puzzle what happened. \nCorin lowers his sword and walks away, leaving Conan to puzzle what happened. \nINT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT \nConan works the bellows, putting his back into it. Corin places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt. \nCONAN Why did it break? \nCORIN Because it had no life. \nCUT TO: \nSparks fly as Corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword with hammer. Corin nods at Conan, who sprinkles the glowing blade with ash. \nCorin walks out of the forge, looking around for Conan. Various other Cimmerians go about the daily routine, but Conan is nowhere to be seen. \nCORIN Conan? \nCorin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick fog creeping in. The fog curls and eddies, something is out there. \nSuddenly, Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength. \nBut the Cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. In seconds they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious charge of their own. \nSLAM! Sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash into each other. And the battle devolves into one-on-ones -- \nWhere the barbarians have the upper hand. Uran and Corin lead the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over the Aquilonian's shorter weapons. \nAnd quickly, the Aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. Corin squares off against Lucius himself. Lucius is sweating. Worried. It wasn't supposed to be this hard. \nLUCIUS Retreat! \nAs a unit, the Aquilonians race back into the woods. In seconds, the Cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit. \nCORIN Wait! Hold your ground! \nBut it's too late, nearly half the Cimmerian warriors are gone on the chase. \nEXT. CLIFF FACE - DAY \nLucius and the Aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face. Nowhere left to run. They turn to see the Cimmerians gathering in front of them. \nURAN Death is in the air, invaders. Can you taste it? \nLUCIUS (SMILES) Indeed. I savor it. \nUran notices something is wrong. His eyes go skyward. Atop the cliff stand Cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers, bows at the ready with FLAMING ARROWS. \nThey let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading right for the Cimmerians. But they do not hit them. They hit the tree trunks beside them. \nAnd for a moment, the Cimmerians look relieved, until they notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows. The flames lick at the substance -- \nKABOOM! The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian warriors are burned alive. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY \nConan spins, started by the sound of the explosion. He sees flames rising above the treetops beyond. \nHe races back home. \nEXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY \nCorin sees the flames in the distance as well. Suddenly, Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. Armed with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining Cimmerians, savage against savage. \nBut the Kushites are not alone. From behind the Cimmerians comes, AKHUN, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned TURANIAN HORSEMEN into the village. \nThe Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves, but the Horsemen attack with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands and dragging them to the ground. \nThe Horsemen quickly gather up the women while Ukafa and his men keep the Cimmerian warriors all too occupied. \nCONAN \nConan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and reaches the far end of the village. \nHuts burn, women are chained, only a handful of Cimmerians still stand. Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are helping the Spearmen slay the wounded. \nConan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the CHARGE -- \nWhen the Zingaran loses his head, lopped off by Corin's blade. \nCONAN Father! \nCORIN Come. \nCorin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant Conan from the battle, back toward the forge. \nINT. FORGE - DAY \nThe flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan into the room. He bolts the door behind him. \nCONAN Do we need more weapons? \nThe guards holding Conan up by his arms, suddenly find those arms wrapped around their heads. Twist, twist. SNAP. SNAP. He breaks both their necks in an instant. \nThe Lieutenant is horrified. He goes for his sword. Conan bats it out of his hand, slamming his head against the back wall. \nCONAN (CONT'D) The key to the cells. \nLIEUTENANT I don't have it. There's a guard inside the door. Only he can open it. \nConan picks up the Lieutenant's sword. \nLIEUTENANT (CONT'D) You can't kill me! He'll only open the door for me! \nA FLASH OF STEEL as Conan delivers a blow. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CELLS - NIGHT \nA GUARD sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door. Behind him, the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD beats a chained ONE-EYED PRISONER to a pulpy mess. \nThere's a KNOCK at the door. \nGUARD #1 What is it? \nMUFFLED VOICE (O.S.) Need to see the Captain. \nThe Guard exhales, frustrated. He stands up, getting his keys out. He stops. Opens the small EYEHOLE to see into the other room. \nThe Lieutenant stares back at him. \nGUARD #1 Fine, fine. \nHe opens the door-- \nOnly to see Conan standing there, holding the decapitated head of the Lieutenant. \nThe shocked Guard goes for his sword. Conan swings the Lieutenant's head, smashing it into the Guard's jaw and putting him down for the count. \nThat's when the Captain of the Guard turns around. And WE RECOGNIZE HIM! He's LUCIUS, the disfigured Aquilionian who was one of Khalar Singh's lieutenants. \nLUCIUS Men! \nFrom around a corner come five more Guards, drawing their weapons. Lucius draws his as well. \nLUCIUS (CONT'D) You've made a huge mistake, ape. You'll never make it out of this place. \nCONAN I came for you, Lucius. \nLucius nods to the guards, who advance on Conan. \nLUCIUS You talk as though you know me, ape. \nCONAN I do. And I am no ape. I am Cimmerian. \nAs recognition crosses Lucius' face, Conan springs into action. He KICKS the table at the men, sending the knives and other torture implements flying right into the first guard. \nThe second guard tries leaping over the falling table. Conan just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the iron bands of the prisoner cells. \nLucius lunges at Conan, Conan steps in on him, grabbing his sword hand. In a show of strength, he twists Lucius' own sword until points down at the floor, then THRUSTS IT THROUGH LUCIUS' FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW. \nLucius BELLOWS in pain, pinned to the spot. \nThe next three Guards rush forward, forcing Conan to deal with three weapons attacks at once. \nThe first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around Conan's sword and he tries to yank it free from Conan's grip. Instead, Conan pulls him in a wide circle, sending him flying into a wall-mounted torch. The guard burns like dry kindling. \nThe second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand, carving a deep gash and causing him to drop his sword. \nConan turns to face him, eyes filled with rage. The guard's face goes pale. Conan head butts him with all his might and the guard goes down, bleeding from mouth, nose and ears. \nHowever, the last Guard is upon Conan before he can react. The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift Conan off his feet and back against the far wall, pinned by the neck. \nConan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his throat into the wall. The thickness of the Cimmerian's neck gives him time to reach into his bracer, pulling out a hidden knife which he buries into the Guardsman's eye. \nCUT TO: \nLucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the burning guard, and lifts the table back onto its legs. Then he pulls the sword out of the floor, a thick plume of blood rising out of Lucius' now liberated foot. \nKHALAR SINGH Take care, Ukafa. You hold a special place in my kingdom, but blood you are not. \nUKAFA My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am simply concerned for your army. \nKHALAR SINGH And I would gladly sacrifice every last man to get my hands on the Queen. And in that respect, Fariq has my confidence. He knows more of the legends of Acheron than anyone. \nSuddenly, two forms race at them from the blinding sand. REMO and FARIQ. No longer a child, Fariq is now a man in his twenties, but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is. His frame is slight, his eyes beady. \nFARIQ Father, they are here! The hidden oasis, just as it was written. \nKhalar Singh looks to Remo for confirmation. The misshapen and shadowy Remo nods. \nEXT. CAVE TUNNEL - DAY \nRemo and Fariq lead Khalar and Ukafa into a natural tunnel carved out of rock. Inside, the sandstorm no longer rages. \nAnd on the other side of the tunnel -- \nEXT. OASIS - CONTINUOUS \nA protected rock oasis, heavy vegetation crawling up the encircling cliff walls, herds of sheep grazing on fields of grass. At its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a Greek- influenced monastery and several tiled-roof, mud-brick houses. \nAnd moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about their simple chores. They wear long flowing white linen robes and turbans. \nThe air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of the oasis. But beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around, sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical hurricane, protected by an unseen force. \nA row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped in thorns. \nOne girl, ILIRA, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl next to her with her thorn. The girl, TAMARA, squeals in pain, angry her prayer was interrupted. \nIlira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship. Tamara the studious good girl. \nTAMARA Stop it! I'm trying to pray! \nILIRA I'm bored. \nTAMARA Then hit yourself. \nTamara hits Ilira back with her thorn. Ilira SQUEALS, then hits a grinning Tamara back. Tamara grabs her, but as they TUSSLE-- \nFASSIR (O.S.) Is that how one shows penitence? \nBoth girls instantly stop as FASSIR appears behind them. Fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery. He shakes his head, both out of fondness and disappointment. \nFASSIR (CONT'D) I expect more from a queen. \nILIRA I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of saying the same prayer every day. \nFASSIR Then you should be able to translate it from its original Acheronian. \nIlira's face scrunches, unsure. Tamara steps in to help Ilira save face. \nTAMARA Of course she can. She even taught it to me. \"Never again.\" \nFASSIR Go on. \nTAMARA Never again will we stand by as darkness consumes the world. Never again will innocents suffer for others' power. Never again will the Queen suffer so Acheron may rise. \nFASSIR Very good, Tamara. You must have taught her very well indeed, Ilira. \nA smile on Fassir's face confirms he knows the truth. \nSuddenly, the monastery's BELL RINGS OUT. A moment later, a temple EXPLODES in flames. \nPouring out from the swirling sands come Khalar Singh's army. Cheren and his archers stand atop Khalar's \nMAN OF WAR \nA massive siege engine atop which CHEREN and his archers fire FLAMING ARROWS. The arrows arc down and explode as they impact the tiled roofs. \nSitting at the highest point of the Man Of War, Khalar Singh likes what he sees. \nCHAOS \nThe monks scatter in every direction, but wherever they turn, more troops burst out of the swirling sand. \nA small handful of armed MONKS display acrobatic martial arts prowess as they battle with Khalar's heavily armed forces, but they are vastly outnumbered. \nREMO It was I, Lord. \nKHALAR SINGH Take four legions. Hunt her. Before I hunt you. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nTamara stumbles through a stretch of barren wasteland, the plumes of the oasis' sandstorm now off in the distance behind her. \nThe sun mercilessly beats down upon her face, her lips are already chapped. She falls to her knees, unable to go on. \nShe looks up, as the heat streams off the desert floor, creating a swirling mirage. Through which the silhouette of a rider appears, followed by others. \nSLAVER CARAVAN \nThe horse-drawn carts of the caravan are lined with iron bars, and behind the bars are a bevy of young women, mostly looking worse for wear. \nThe HEAD SLAVER rides ahead, and walks up to the heap of white cloth that is Tamara. \nTAMARA Water -- please -- \nHe lifts her barely conscious head, eyeing her features, a greasy paw examining her body. He smiles. \nHEAD SLAVER The gods are good. (to the other slavers) Chain this one in my cage. She'll be the prize of the auction in Khor Kalba. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OASIS - NIGHT \nThe Man of War dominates the center of the oasis, its torches illuminating the scene before it. Akhun and the Turanians hold chains connected to the twenty women monks, kneeling, with their wrists chained to their neck collars. \nIn front of them kneels Fassir, beaten and bloodied. \nKhalar Singh, Fariq, and Ukafa step down from the Man of War. Fariq carries with him a large iron box with ornate carvings on it. \nKHALAR SINGH All these years searching the ends of the earth. And here you are. Just a two day ride from Khor Kalba. I can scarcely believe it. \nFASSIR (in Acheronian, to monks) Say nothing. \nKHALAR SINGH (IN ACHERONIAN) Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't know who we are. Maybe he's not looking for the Queen. \nSeveral of the women look up at him, shocked. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) That's right, my brethren, you have been lied to all your lives. Told you must hide yourselves, told you were alone. I want you to look at me, and see me for what I am. A brother. A friend. I have come not to hurt you, but liberate you. \nFASSIR You come for your own dark purposes, to raise Acheron. \nKHALAR SINGH Yes. I come to resurrect the greatest empire Hyboria has ever known. \nFASSIR An empire of evil, soaked in blood sacrifice and the blackest of magic. \nKhalar Singh becomes infuriated, eyes blazing. \nKHALAR SINGH Have you hidden from the world so long that you cannot to see? Blood, magic, death: it is everywhere. Acheron is no different than any other kingdom, but for its glory. (MORE) \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) And in place of that glory, you offer shame? I knew shame, but that was before I was shown my true lineage. \nKhalar draws closer to the women, looking them each in the eye. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) When I was but a child, raiders destroyed my village, cut our fathers to ribbons, and burned our women as sacrifice to foreign gods. Those few who survived, we ran for our lives, chased into caves at the edge of the Eastern Sea, left with nothing to live for. But then we discovered it. Acheron. The temple that spawned an empire. We learned that we were not broken goat- herders on a desolate coastline. We were the sons and daughters of kings. (stares in Ilira's eyes) And queens. \nHe motions to Fariq, who brings the iron box forward. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) For thirty years I have searched for you. In that time I built both an army and empire, but they are nothing compared to what we can create together. We can raise Acheron again. Never again will we hide like rats. Never again will we watch as our loved ones are slaughtered. I call forth the Queen. Stand and join me, and this day will have a joyous end. \nNo one moves. \nFASSIR You would have all the world suffer, as you have suffered. We will die before we help you. \nKHALAR SINGH Yes. You will. \nHe nods to his son. He paces in front of the female monks, the box in front of them. \nFARIQ The caves beneath Khor Khalba contain all manner of creature, many -- altered -- by centuries of blood magic. But one, in particular, has developed a special connection to the blood. A thirst. It is said that only the Queen of Acheron itself can resist its embrace. \nHe stops, one woman away from Ilira. \nAs a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them, before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter. The riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand. \nCONAN \nConan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder. As it rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. From this height, Conan launches himself down at the horsemen below. \nWHAM! He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square in the saddle. He kicks the horse straight at the other riders. They don't see him coming until it's too late. He cuts them down where they sit. \nThe last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team, trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. Conan spins to see a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's decapitated. \nWhich is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the wagon. \nREMO \nThe explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout. He takes the reins, stopping the wagon. \nConan spots him, recognition in his eyes. \nCONAN (CONT'D) You! \nThere's a SCREAM. Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one of the caged wagons. A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara, only to have her FIGHT BACK. \nTamara kicks the first Scout in the face, slamming his head into the bars. However, the second one clubs her unconscious from behind. \nCONAN \nLeaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo. Remo dives and rolls away. Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very fast. \nConan strikes again. Again Remo dodges out of the way. \nThe Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off, speaking in the broken language of a savage. \nREMO The girl! Bring her to Khalar! \nConan launches an all out attack. Remo leaps over his sword and vaults Conan, landing on his back. He draws his sword, preparing to cut Conan's throat -- \nWhen Conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge rolling boulders. The impact crushes Remo and he loses his grip. \nConan spins to strike again, only to see Remo MELT INTO THE SHADOW OF THE BOULDER. \nConan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow Scouts as they drag the unconscious Tamara away. \nConan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards the Scouts. They see him coming and let go of Tamara. THEY MELT AWAY INTO HER SHADOW AND DISAPPEAR. \nCUT TO: \nTAMARA \nDazed, she struggles to her feet. Conan appears beside her, his dagger out. Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches out and breaks the lock on her chains. \nCONAN Who are you? \nTAMARA I am nobody. \nHe cuts the bonds on her feet. Tamara rises up, the battle scene revealed to her. \nDead bodies of the Slavers and Turanian horsemen lie sprawled in every direction. Tamara takes in the gruesome sight, shocked. \nCONAN Many died to capture nobody. (motions to his horse) Get up. \nTAMARA And if I don't wish to ride with you? \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nConan rides his horse, Tamara trailing on foot, wrists tethered to Conan's saddle by a long rope. Tamara looks exhausted. \nThey reach a gallery of broken columns, spires of fossilized coral that juts out of the desert. \nTAMARA Stop! I want water. \nConan just keeps riding. \nCONAN Perhaps the slavers took your orders. I don't. \nTAMARA I never knew men could be so cruel. Now I wonder if the world is filled with animals such as you. \nCONAN You speak of animals as if they were less than men. But animals don't stab their brothers in the back or steal their mother's only possession. And they never lie. \nWe GLIDE DOWN past hundred foot high pillars of flames, towards the growing sounds of SCREAMING and WAILING. \nThe streets of Acheron are lined with thousands of SLAVES, young and old, chained together, toiling under the lash of their cruel masters, the \nACHERONIAN WARRIORS \nTowering over the slaves, the warriors are a fearsome sight. Their armor, crafted from the bones of their defeated enemies, rises to a mask which covers much of their features. \nOnly the red irises of their eyes peer through. That and their pitch black skin. \nThe slaves hobble down the main boulevard, their naked feet splashing in streams of BLOOD which flow from the \nACHERONIAN PYRAMID \nUp ahead looms a colossal pyramid, surrounded in a semi- circle by five massive statues. As we grow closer the grotesque surface of the pyramid becomes clearer, one hewn from cracked bone and empty sockets. \nThe thunderous heartbeat seems all around us now. THUMP, THUMP. \nThe three hundred foot high edifice is made ENTIRELY OF THOUSANDS OF HUMAN SKULLS. Many of the skulls still drip with blood, pouring down from the pyramid's crest, where stands \nA BLACK THRONE \nImages of snakes gorging themselves on hapless victims are carved in bas relief into the throne's surface. \nStanding before the throne, surrounded by BLACK ROBED PRIESTS are a man and woman, mere shadows in the silhouette of torches. \nThe HEAD PRIEST and his ACOLYTE approach with TWO CROWNS. One is made of GOLD, the other of IRON. \nThe Gold crown goes on the head of the man. For the woman, the Iron crown is placed on her head. \nAnd suddenly, THUMP, THUMP. IRON SPIKES SHOOT OUT OF THE IRON CROWN PIERCING THE WOMAN'S FOREHEAD, HER SCREAMS ECHOES THROUGHOUT THE CITY. \nBlood streams down the woman's face as she turns toward the torchlight. \nIT IS TAMARA. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT \nTamara leaps up, startled. Her face is covered in sweat, her eyes as terrified as the victim from her dream. \nNearby we hear screaming of another type. Remo. \nEXT. OPEN FIELD - NIGHT \nMUFFLED SCREAMS. We pull out of Remo's wide mouth, stuffed with cloth, trying to bellow in uncontrollable agony. \nA hand comes in and pulls out the cloth. It's Conan. \nREMO Please! Mercy! \nCONAN You are more fit to inflict torture than to endure it. Your life is not nailed to your spine as my peoples are. \nWe PULL OUT, revealing that Remo arms are spread-eagle, attached to ropes pulled taught by opposing tree limbs. \nConan nudges him with the point of his sword. Remo SCREAMS in agony, then speaks in his savage, broken dialect. \nREMO Stop! Stop! I know how make you rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar Singh? You have what he want. The girl, yes? Khalar give you anything for her. More! \nCONAN Why would he? \nRemo pauses, not wanting to answer. Conan put the blade back to Remo's neck. \nREMO She could be the one. \nCONAN One what? \nREMO The one. The Queen. \nConan's mind races, remembering Khalar's words from long ago. \nCONAN A queen in hiding. \nREMO Yes! Yes! I sent to find her. Bring her. He wait for me now, at Great Wall. He pay you anything. More! \nCONAN So I should ransom her to your master? Not exactly loyal -- but still, a good idea. \nConan looks at the sword. It strikes a chord in him. IT IS THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED! Enraged, Conan charges the slight Fariq. \nFariq partially parries the attack. He's obviously well- trained, but he's no match for Conan. The tip of Conan' blade cuts a large gash in Fariq's cheek. \nKHALAR SINGH Fariq! \nKhalar Singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and flinging him away from the barbarian. Fariq struggles to stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment. \nConan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall walk. \nCONAN I was wondering what it would take for you to stop cowering. \nKHALAR SINGH I wasn't cowering. I was studying. You're quite gifted with a sword, but it's not from schooling. Your speed and power makes up for a lack of -- finesse. I've seen such fighting before -- Cimmerian. \nEnraged, Conan charges Khalar Singh. He swings down on Khalar Singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds nothing but air. Khalar is fast. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Cimmerian it is. Now it makes sense. You came for blood, not gold. \nConan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a broad arc, with all his might. Even in the small space, Khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. He sidesteps Conan's attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his tulwar. \nConan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing Khalar could have just as easily sliced his throat. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Your people barely afforded me a challenge. You're little more than beasts. \nConan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury, smashing entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades the attack. \nDown the wall walk they move, Conan attacking while Khalar seems complacent enough just to defend. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) You've come a long way, barbarian, only to fail. \nKhalar ducks Conan's last wild swing and gashes Conan twice, both deeply in his midsection. Khalar then KICKS Conan, sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet. \nCRUNCH. Conan lands directly on his back, his sword clattering away from him. Khalar's men back away into a circle. Conan struggles to get on all fours. \nKhalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest, lifting Conan off the ground with his might. He follows up with a devastating punch to Conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver. CRUNCH. \nConan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) So much for vengeance. (to his soldiers) Get me oil -- and a torch. \nSoldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Is that really the best you could do? Is that as far as you could think ahead? Just rush in and kill me? \nBehind Khalar Singh, Conan spots Tamara being brought up, her hands bound. Her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as well. \nTAMARA' HANDS \nBetween the bonds she slips down a blade. It's CONAN'S DAGGER. She quickly cuts her bonds. \nWith all the attention focused on Conan, no one is quick enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER, LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHEREN'S QUIVER. \nCheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched arrows. \nCHEREN No!! \nBut it's far too late. Tamara hits the floor, beside Conan. BOOM. \nEXPLOSION \nThe blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction. Ukafa, Fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the concussion. \nKhalar Singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is THROWN AGAINST THE WALL! \nKHALAR SINGH \nThe warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire. \nHe grits his teeth and climbs the wall. \nATOP THE WALL \nA thick wall of flame rages before Khalar. Conan and Tamara are gone. He looks over the far side of the wall, where two figures on horseback ride off into the distance, Tamara holding Conan atop the horse. \nUkafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees. \nKHALAR SINGH Ukafa, you will take half our forces North, to the Sea. I will take the rest South. \nConan spins to see the rough, brightly dressed Zamoran pirate ARTUS leaping down from the quarterdeck, his sword out. \nThe other ZAMORAN PIRATES draw near as well. Tamara sees the scene, suddenly uncomfortable. \nCONAN I was just wondering what that smell was. (sniffs near Artus) Now I know. \nARTUS We take no stowaways. Only paying passengers. You've best be laden with gold. \nCONAN If it's metal you seek, perhaps you'd settle for steel. \nIn a flash Conan's sword lunges forward. CLANG. It meets Artus's, sparking as they collide. Artus LAUGHS. \nCONAN (CONT'D) Still fast Artus. \nARTUS Fast, deadly, charming, rakishly handsome. (to the pirates) All hail Conan! \nPIRATES All hail Conan! \nArtus slaps his hand on Conan's back and Conan winces in pain. \nARTUS Sorry, friend. Looks like you've had a rough road. \nCONAN It won't get easier. Khalar Singh lives. He'll be coming for me and the girl. \nARTUS Good. We're scrapping for a fight these days. \nCONAN This one may be more than you wish. I need you to get me close to Khor Kalba. \nArtus rubs his beard. \nARTUS Rest up. We'll get you there. \nConan withdraws to his room. \nINT. ROOM - NIGHT \nConan collapses on the bed as Tamara follows him inside. \nTAMARA We go to Khor Kalba? \nCONAN I do. \nConan puts a brawny arm over his tired eyes. \nTAMARA No. We do. \nCONAN Just leave me to sleep. \nBut Tamara doesn't leave, forcing Conan to respond. \nCONAN (CONT'D) You would risk your life for royalty? Why? \nTamara pauses, realizing she must trust Conan to gain his help. \nTAMARA Because she represent freedom, not just ours but all Hyboria's. What do you know of Acheron? \nCONAN A tall tale. Meant to scare children. \nTAMARA It is no fable. It's my people's history. Acheron was an empire that swallowed all of Hyboria, led by the King and his legion of demon warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable. Immortal. But still it had one weakness. For the true power of Acheron laid not with its King, but the Queen. Every twenty years, a new queen from the royal line would be coronated with a crown of iron. Spikes would pierce her, slowly drain her precious blood, and through her suffering Acheron would remain invincible. Until one of my ancestors, an Acheronian himself, put a stop to this tyranny. He and others spirited the new Queen away, hiding her from the empire and all those who would raise it again. \nCONAN What care I for queens and empires? \nConan turns to head back to his bed. Tamara grabs him, incensed. \nTAMARA Didn't you hear me? This evil faces us all. All of civilization will fall if the army of Acheron is raised again. \nCONAN I heard. Only I would happily put all of your \"civilization\" to the torch myself. \nTAMARA But -- you owe me a debt, you thankless oaf! \nCONAN My only debt is to my people. And it still lies unpaid. \nEXT. MAN OF WAR - NIGHT \nThe enormous siege vessel lies before a burning PORT CITY. \nA SAILOR, crying, grovels on his knees before Khalar and his men. \nTerrified as she is, the young monk says nothing. Fariq closes the box. \nFARIQ (CONT'D) No? Your fear is not enough yet? Let's try harder. \nFariq nods to the slavers, who unchain her from the rest. \nFARIQ (CONT'D) I've read all there is to know of mighty Acheron. Why would true Acheronians protect a traitor to their own? You once held the entire world in your grasp, now you hide and cower like pitiful mice. \nHe pushes the girl. She falls to the grid, the sound echoing down into the pit. \nAN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness. Something comes. The girl looks below. \nFARIQ (CONT'D) And mice are meant to be swallowed whole. \nSuddenly, a MASSIVE TENTACLE, ten times the size of the one in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. It grabs the young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the darkness below. \nHer SCREAMS echo. \nFARIQ (CONT'D) What was in the box could only drink from you one at a time. But the beast of Acheron, it will claim four of you this night. (MORE) \nFARIQ (CONT'D) Who will spare the rest and tell me which of you is the queen? \nNot a single woman moves, resolved. Ilira catches herself, but also stays silent. She looks up to see Fariq staring at her. \nCU - ILIRA'S EYES \nHer pupils widen in fear as Fariq's cold stare bores into her. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) I am here, swine. \nFariq turns -- only it is another FEMALE MONK that glares at him. \nFEMALE MONK I am the one you seek. \nFariq smiles. \nFARIQ At last. Some bravery. But of course, you wouldn't expect me to take your word, would you? \nAs the Fariq reaches for her-- \nCUT TO: \nINT. GALLEY - ROOM - NIGHT \nTamara awakens with a SCREAM, her body resting against the curved hull of the ship. \nTAMARA No!!! \nTamara looks around with a panicked look, until she realizes where she is. \nCONAN (O.S.) I hope I awoke with less clamor. \nTheir roles reversed, now it is Tamara's turn to see Conan sitting nearby, drinking from a flask of mead. \nTAMARA You're drinking? You were near death this time yesterday. \nCONAN Is there a better reason to drink? \nTamara actually manages to LAUGH. \nTAMARA Do you think--I could try some of that? I'm curious of its taste. \nCONAN You've never tasted mead? \nTamara shrugs, embarrassed. Conan hands her flask. She takes a deep swallow, some spilling out over her cheeks. But she doesn't cough, and smiles brightly afterwards. \nTAMARA It's good. \nConan reaches for the flask, but Tamara ignores him, taking another swig. It quickly loosens her tongue. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Let me ask you something. Once you've killed Khalar and claimed your vengeance, then what? You will be free from your ghosts. What of your future, Conan? \nCONAN I have no future. It died with my people, as I should have. \nTAMARA So your life is penance? For what, for living? And when you too die, what do you believe happens then? \nConan just shrugs, taking back the mead. \nSure enough, the stern of the ship begins to part, revealing - \nA MASSIVE CROSSBOW \nMounted with a barbed harpoon, fifteen feet long. \nCONAN Fire! \nThey fire the weapon. The harpoon races for the bow of the Warship, a thick rope trailing it. It smashes into the wood, ripping through it like it was paper. \nCONAN (CONT'D) Rip her apart! \nThe Pirates grab the heavy rope and run, pulling the rope, and the harpoon back towards the Wasp. \nAs it's pulled out, the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider hole in the warship. \nWARSHIP \nThe Captain and crew are in a panic. Men rush to patch the gaping hole in the hull. \nSAILOR We're taking on water! \nCAPTAIN Hard to port! \nUKAFA No. Let them fire again! \nCAPTAIN We will sink. \nUkafa guts the captain with his spear. \nUKAFA So be it. (to his spearmen) Get below. Be ready. \nGALLEY \nThe pirates load the harpoon in the crossbow device a second time. \nCONAN Fire! \nIt fires, smashing again into the wooden hull of the Warship. \nWARSHIP - INSIDE \nThe harpoon lodges deep inside the hull -- where Ukafa and his spearmen wait. \nUKAFA Now! \nThey rush forward and grab onto the harpoon. \nGALLEY \nARTUS Bring her back! \nAgain, the pirates pull the harpoon back out. It falls into the water as they pull on the rope tied to it. \nThey do not notice Ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the very same rope as its pulled toward the Galley. \nArtus looks at the Warship. It's foundering and sinking quickly. \nARTUS (CONT'D) She's dead in the water! \nA CHEER goes up among the pirates -- \nAnd then one PIRATE takes a spear through the chest. All eyes turn to the side of the Wasp, where Ukafa and his men climb aboard. \nConan's eyes alight with fury. \nCONAN Good. I was growing weary with boredom. \nConan motions to a pair of pirates. \nCONAN (CONT'D) Hide her below. \nBATTLE \nThe Spearmen rush to the attack. The pirates spring to the defense of the ship, countering the Spearmen with cutlass and dagger. Ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages. \nUKAFA Find the girl! \nINT. COLOSSUS HEAD - DUSK \nConan pulls off his jerkin, revealing a torso rippling with muscles. \nCONAN We'll rest here until morning. \nTAMARA Will I awake alone? Do you intend to leave me? \nCONAN I would do you a kindness. Khor Kalba will bring only death. \nTAMARA Please, Conan. Artus told me of how you lost your tribe. I too had to watch as my people were taken from me. \nConan ignores her, gathering wood for a fire. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) All I ask is that you let me travel with you. I too have a purpose. I must get to the queen. I would rather you kill me here, than fail her again. \nConan continues collecting, infuriating Tamara. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) I was wrong about you. You are no fearless warrior. Your heart is closed to all but fear -- and hate. \nConan draws flint, starting the fire. Only once his task is complete does he answer Tamara. \nCONAN We leave at dawn. I will not break stride for you. Not once. I will get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond that I have my purpose, and you yours. \nTamara offers a thankful nod, her anger subsiding. \nTAMARA Nice fire. Does it mean you'll actually cook the meat this time? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. KHALAR SINGH'S WARSHIP - DUSK \nKhalar looks at the destruction of Ukafa's warship, the bodies filling the water. Khalar spots Ukafa's dead body floating there, harpoon still lodged in his chest. \nThe ship's CAPTAIN approaches. \nCAPTAIN The pirate ship sailed to the west. Even under full sail it'll be no easy task to overtake her. \nJust then, a FALCON approaches. The Falconer retrieves it, a parchment tied to its talon. He passes it on to Khalar Singh. \nKhalar Singh reads it, a smile creeping upon his face. \nKHALAR SINGH Fariq has done well. (to the Captain) Head east, back to Khor Kalba. \nCAPTAIN But our chase points the other way. \nKHALAR SINGH The chase is over. They come to me now. \nEXT. FOREST - LATE DAY \nTamara watches Conan from a distance. He silently stalks prey with nothing more than a knife. \nA BOAR \nIts ears listen intently, aware. Suddenly, it bolts. \nCONAN \nIs just as quick, racing through the forest on a intercepting course with the great beast. He leaps over a fallen log, throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm. \nThe boar goes down, the blade through its jugular. Conan walks up to the struggling beast, showing no satisfaction as he mercifully SNAPS its neck. \nINT. COLOSSUS HEAD - NIGHT \nThe great haunches of the beast roast over the fire. Conan turns the meat. \nBehind him, Tamara approaches. She has cleaned herself up, her white robe translucent in light of the fire, her wet hair glistening. \nConan can't help but notice her supple skin, her curves. He stops chewing. \nTamara notices. Embarrassed, she turns so that he can only see her side. Conan returns to his food. \nTAMARA What were the women of your tribe like, Conan? \nCONAN They fought beside the men. \nTAMARA So they were equals. And your mother? \nCONAN (CONT'D) Let's go. \nEXT. CIRCULAR STAIRWAY - CISTERN \nAs they work their way up the circular stairwell, towards a thin shaft of firelight up ahead. \nINT. DUNGEON - NIGHT \nCarved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors, leading to prison cells. \nConan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way to the floor of the hallway. The heavy darkness presses in on Conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing. \nThe floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES, in varying states of decay. There are buckets, filled with entrails and feces, upended. Tamara put her hand over her mouth. \nConan continues down the hallway. He and Tamara begin to hear the sound of EERIE CHANTING. \nTAMARA What is that? \nUp ahead, the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as the torches end. Conan holds up his own torch, struggling to peer into the black void. \nCONAN Nothing good. \nConan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND blows out his torch. A moment later, there's the sound of A GATE WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND. \nIn the darkness, comes a DEEP, EARTHY CHUCKLE. \nVOICE (O.S.) Welcome. \nA HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP, revealing that the gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a vast CAGE built around a massive PIT. \nINT. THE PIT - NIGHT \nThe same pit where Fariq sacrificed the female monk, only now, a half dozen COMBATANTS stand on the grid above the void. \nHanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other PRISONERS, including Tamara's fellow female monks. Several of them YELL out Tamara's name as they see her. \nAnd watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage, is the massive Akhun and several of his slavers. \nAKHUN Which ever one of you slaves gets me the girl, lives. \nThe Combatants all close in on Conan and Tamara, each taking a different plank way to get to them. \nCONAN (TO TAMARA) Stay behind me. \nTamara steps behind Conan, who blocks the others' path to her. \nCONAN (CONT'D) Who dies first? \nThe first two COMBATANTS attack as one, the first wielding a short sword, the other a pike. The pikeman thrusts first, Conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending the wielder off balance and into the abyss. \nThe prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better, as Conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single blow. \nTAMARA \nTamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the top half of the metallic cage. She begins scaling the cage, her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks. \nCONAN \nThree more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo. Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much like the one Conan cut through earlier. \nTENTACLED MONSTER \nUp from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a gigantic octopus-like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth. \nThe creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in its gnashing maw. \nThe creature reaches for Conan, who ducks underneath the tentacle, the slices it off. He immediately turns back to check on Tamara -- and he discovers she's not there. \nHe looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty feet directly above him. \nCONAN (CONT'D) Crom! \nAKHUN \nThe massive warrior spots Tamara getting close to the prisoner baskets and motions to his two Jailers. \nAKHUN Get her! \nTamara looks at the other monks. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Our duty was to keep the queen safe. We failed. But if Khalar brings her to Acheron, it will rise again -- and all our peoples' sacrifice is for nothing. (MORE) \nTAMARA (CONT'D) So if the queen is not free by the stroke of midnight -- she must be already dead. \nThe other monks nod and they start to head off. Tamara is the last to head off, her eyes burning into Conan's. \nCONAN You want my help again. \nTAMARA No. You kept your word, I'll keep mine. I pray you fulfill your debt. \nTamara kisses Conan's cheek one last time and heads off. \nINT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nThe monk travel in single file, the Elder Monk leading the way. Suddenly, she stops, motioning to an entranceway ahead. \nELDER MONK (WHISPERING) Guard. \nTAMARA (WHISPERING) Don't kill him. We need to find out which way Ilira was taken. \nThe Elder Monk nods and slips up ahead. We hear a SMASH. \nINT. CATACOMB ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT \nThe stunned GUARD lies before the assembled monks. Tamara glares down at him. \nTAMARA Tell us where the last girl was taken. \nThe Guard just LAUGHS at them through bloody teeth. \nCONAN (O.S.) Let me ask. \nThe Guard's face drops as Conan steps out from the darkness. \nTAMARA Your debt -- \nCONAN Will be where your queen is. \nTamara smiles. She knows it is a half truth. \nINT. FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT \nAs Conan and the monks enter, the throne room is empty, scattered light barely illuminating the expansive chamber. \nIlira sits on the throne, crown on her slumped head. Tamara runs over to her. \nTAMARA Ilira! \nShe raises Ilira's head, only to discover lifeless eyes. Tamara cradles her best friend's face. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) She's dead. It's over. \nVOICE (O.S.) Not yet. \nBefore the monks can react, ARROWS STREAK OUT FROM THE DARKNESS, killing them all. Only Conan is quick enough to dodge his arrow by diving aside. \nWhen he comes up, Khalar has Tamara, his sword at her neck. Several ARCHERS stand behind him, at the ready. \nKHALAR SINGH It's only begun. Because that one was not the heir to Acheron. \nKhalar smiles down at Tamara. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) She is. \nSlowly, what he's saying dawns on her. \nTAMARA No. It can't be -- \nKHALAR SINGH Secretive, the traitors of Acheron. It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally wrung honesty from the girl. That poor innocent was forced to live a lie, even as the truth was kept from the queen herself. (MORE) \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) (TO CONAN) And you did the rest, barbarian. My thanks for delivering the Queen to me. \nTAMARA No! \nSuddenly, a trap door opens beneath Conan and drops down in the darkness, landing with a heavy THUD. \nINT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT \nIt takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous doors. Khalar Singh rides in. Moonlight from the huge eyes of the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. Faces of demonic warrior statues. \nAt their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too numerous to count. \nTAMARA This is no empire, only a graveyard. \nKHALAR SINGH You see only with your eyes. \nKhalar nods to his men. Two Guardsmen take their torches and light other torches set in the walls. It sets off a chain reaction. As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing the true scope of this place. \nAn enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin. \nAnd at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL. The pool is empty. \nKhalar turns to his guards. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Close the gates and stay here. Send my son to me when he arrives. (motioning to two of them) You two, come with me. \nTHE ALTAR \nKhalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of purple-shaded rock. Around its edges are deep channels, for the blood of its victims. And on its four corners -- shackles of bone. \nKHALAR SINGH The Acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance, don't you think? For one to ascend to royalty, another must fall. \nWith the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds. \nTamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar absorbs the blow effortlessly. He throws Tamara upon the altar, his two guards shackling her in place. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) For a hundred generations the kings of Acheron were crowned, and the queens were sacrificed. \nKhalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar. Like a Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES. \nAnd from the box he lifts two items. A CROWN OF GOLD and A CROWN OF IRON. The crown of gold is magnificent, ornately detailed gold that glows in the firelight. \nBut the crown of iron is terrifying. Huge rough spikes extend from it in every direction. It looks more like a weapon than a crown. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) What a day for you. This morning you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you are a queen giving birth to an empire. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nBloodied and weary, Conan approaches the Skull Rock. He has nothing more than his sword, his loincloth and a small BURLAP SACK tied to his hip. \nHe stumbles, falling to his knees. His wounds have taken a grave toll. Still he stands and presses on. \nHe pushes on the doors. They do not budge in the least. He puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining to their utmost. Again -- no movement. \nConan backs away, taking stock of the surroundings. He climbs up the side of the rock. \nINT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT \nKhalar Singh CHANTS in Acheronian. Ancient, harsh words, as he lifts the two crowns overhead, offering them to the statues of dark gods all around. \nTAMARA Stop. You don't know what you are about to do. \nKHALAR SINGH But I do. For thirty years I have dreamed of this day. The day our people rise from the ashes. \nKhalar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown upon his head. As he does so, the light from the moon reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an unnatural glow. \nTHUMP-THUMP. A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. It sounds like the heartbeat of a giant. \nKhalar next places the iron crown around Tamara's head. She thrashes and struggles but to no avail. \nOnce the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP! The spikes around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE THEMSELVES INTO HER HEAD. She SCREAMS in agony. \nBlood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels around the edges of the altar. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) It begins. You give birth to an empire. \nEXT. THE SIDE OF THE SKULL - NIGHT \nConan climbs -- muscles straining -- slipping -- hanging on by one hand -- and climbing again. \nTHUMP-THUMP. The statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth does. Conan nearly slips, but keeps his grip. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) The Queen. Shackle her! \nTHE ALTAR \nIn agony, Tamara pulls one of the spikes out, then another. She pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off her bloodied head -- \nWhen the Guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the crown back on. \nTHUMP, THUMP! The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper as Tamara SCREAMS. The blood now fills the channels of the altar. \nWE FOLLOW the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around the altar until reaching the channel's end -- \nTHE FIRST DROP OF TAMARA'S BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL POOL. It BOILS instantly, multiplying itself exponentially, bubbling forth and filling the entire pool. \nAND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. A massive earthquake jolts the entire cave. \nTHE KILLING FLOOR \nAs Khalar Singh and Conan battle, the ground beneath them on the wide cave floor CRACKS and SPLINTERS. \nTHUMP-THUMP! The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor of the cave GIVES WAY, tumbling into an incredible abyss. Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can reach to prevent them from falling further. \nConan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the cave. Khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred pool. \nTheir bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow. They look below, searching for the source of the glow. \nACHERON \nAnother two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of ancient Acheron. The cave is but a forechamber, the slightest taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron. \nAnd as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows there MOVE. \nIs it a trick of the light? No. Whatever the dark forms are, they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires and leaping impossibly far to climb up after Conan and Khalar Singh. \nKhalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Beyond my dreams -- \nTHE ALTAR \nTamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised to fall into the fiery depths. \nTAMARA Conan!!! \nCONAN \nOn the other side of the abyss, Conan spots her and scales the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. He moves quickly, trying to get to Tamara. \nKHALAR SINGH \nKhalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures rises out of the pit. They climb the walls like insects, clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying mantis. \nACHERONIAN WARRIORS \nThe look like the statues above -- a hybrid -- part human, part demon. Their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red eyes and gnashing teeth. \nThey advance on Khalar Singh, who is furthest down now that Conan climbs upward towards Tamara. \nKHALAR SINGH (IN ACHERONIAN) I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron. I command you to kneel! \nAnd this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor sharp teeth bared. Unsure, Khalar grips his tulwars tight. The demonic creatures draw close, and they -- kneel. They climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads before Khalar Singh. \nOut of the corner of his eye, Khalar spots Conan, drawing near. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) (IN ACHERONIAN) Show him the might of the army of Acheron! \nBut they do not rush to follow the order. They stir. One of them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at Khalar's Guardsmen. \nACHERONIAN COMMANDER (IN ACHERONIAN) First, we feed. \nIts voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss. \nKHALAR SINGH Fine. Take your fill. I will kill him myself. \nCONAN \nConan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across chasms from statue to statue. Just below him, the first wave of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining Guardsmen. \n", "test1_input": "One by one, the lieutenants beat and stab Corin, taking pleasure in his pain. \nConan struggles, trying to move, to yell, to do anything other than lie there. But a huge timber lies upon his back, pinning him to the ground. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Fariq! Come! \nEntering the wrecked forge is FARIQ, the six year old son to Khalar Singh. He stares at Corin's bleeding form with the dispassion of a sociopath. \nKhalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged together, the one Corin took away. He admires it, then hands it to his son. He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for his son to lift alone. He instructs his son as if teaching him multiplication. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Before you lies our enemy. His tribe waits for him in the beyond. What would you do? \nFARIQ I would cut out his eyes, father, so that he will not find them. So he will wander the afterlife forever. \nKhalar smiles. \nKHALAR SINGH Show me your strength, Fariq. Without it, you will never rule. With it, you will never be forgotten. \nFariq DRIVES THE SWORD INTO CORIN'S EYE. Corin doesn't make a sound. Once Fariq has ripped out Corin's eyes, Khalar runs Corin through. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) You have your desire. Death has found you. \nCorin spits out his last words, also meant for Conan. \nCORIN Soon -- it comes for you. \nCONAN'S POV \nConan glimpses around the faces of Khalar and his men, each image seared into his memory as if ablaze. \nKHALAR SINGH Burn this place. It no longer exists. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY \nThe forge is lit afire from a half dozen torches, thrown onto its roof and inside its windows. Khalar and the other watch as the building roars into flame. \nINT. FORGE - DAY \nSmoke fills the air. Conan struggles, still unable to move. He COUGHS, dying. \nBut then the fire collapses more of the forge, and the falling beams shatter the one that pins Conan to the ground. \nSlowly, painfully, Conan drags himself into the cooling trough that runs beneath the hut. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nEXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY \nConan exits the forge only to see the entire village burning. The bodies of everyone he has ever known litter the landscape. Nothing stirs. Until he hears a strange CHOPPING SOUND. \nTHE PICT \nConan spots the Pict, who is decapitating a dead Cimmerian warrior, adding to the collection of heads at his tattooed waist. \nThe Pict doesn't notice as Conan slips up behind him, then RUNS HIM THROUGH. \nAs the wide-eyed Pict dies, Conan takes the sword and CUTS A NOTCH into his arm. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nNOTCHED ARM \nWhere there was once a single notch, there are now FIVE such notches, on a much broader arm that struggles to pin another powerful looking arm. \nINT. BAR - MESSANTIA - NIGHT \nA raucous bar on the Argossean waterfront. Out the window we see a port lined with Shemish galleys and junks from Kush. \nThe bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of those ships, and those who desire to part them from their hard-earned money; Zamoran thieves, Hyborean mercenaries and Brythunian whores. Most of them watch the arm wrestling match taking place at the back of the bar. \nA pair of CITY GUARDS, short swords sheathed at their sides, enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the harried BARKEEP. \nBARKEEP He's back there. \nThe barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers. \n", "test1_true": "BARKEEP What's he done?! What hasn't he done? He's bedded six of my whores and finished off three casks of mead--and he hasn't paid so much as a silver piece for it. \nCITY GUARD #1 So have your men deal with him. \nBARKEEP I did. \nBehind the bar, six men each hold down two HULKING MEN YELLING in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped back into place. \nCITY GUARD #2 Sounds like a real problem. Too bad we have other places to be right now. \nThe Barkeep shakes his head, knowing the routine. He slips a pair of silver pieces into the soldier's hand. \nBARKEEP Just get that behemoth out of here. \nThe two City Guards make their way to the back of the bar. His back to them, the DRUNKEN MAN they're after struggles to pin his opponent, cobras beneath each of their wrists, ready to strike at the loser. A pair of voluptuous WHORES watch, caressing the Drunken Man's sinewy back. \nThe Drunken Man YELLS in fury as he SLAMS the other man's hand down upon the cobra, which immediately bites its prey. \nAs the soldiers arrive, the drunken victor throws his tankard of ale at the Barkeep, who's now back behind the bar. \nDRUNKEN MAN Piss-water! You'll serve my friends and I your best, barman, or you'll taste steel! \nCITY GUARD #1 Time to leave, northerner. \nThe Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on his shoulder. \nCONAN \nThe gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully built man, broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with battle scars. Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut black mane remain from the boy we last saw. \nConan stands to his full height, looming over the smaller City Guards, who instinctively take a step back. \nCONAN No, my small friends. It's time to die. Now-- \nConan sways. The room spins. He falls on his face. \nCONAN (CONT'D) Who's first -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nConan, unconscious, is dragged down the street by the two City Guards. \nCITY GUARD #1 (STRUGGLING) By the gods, he's as heavy as a horse. \nCITY GUARD #2 Even a dead horse smells better than this. \nEXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT \nThe City Guards drag Conan into a broad prison yard. Many of the INMATES are shackled together, hacking with picks at the rock walls on their work detail. Those in no condition to break rock are left in their own filth to rot. Some are even dead already, the rats gnawing at the remains. \nINT. PRISON GUARDHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe two City Guards drag Conan into the guardhouse, where a LIEUTENANT sits eating his dinner. \nThe Lieutenant doesn't even bother to look up from his meal. \nLIEUTENANT What's the charge? \nCITY GUARD #2 Public drunkenness. Another damn hill ape who can't handle his liquor. \nLIEUTENANT Is that so, boy? How do you plead? \nConan yawns in response. One of the City Guards slaps Conan, hard, across the face. Conan slowly opens his eyes. \nCONAN Where's the Captain of the Guard? \nSCREAMS OF PAIN come from down the hall, past a locked door. \nLIEUTENANT In the cells, interrogating a prisoner. And you'll get the same if you don't answer. You're accused of public drunkenness. How do you plead? \nCONAN In truth, I've been guilty of much. Jewels stolen from the crowns of kings, men's heads split in battle for the price of a night's drink. But through that I've searched and waited and hunted my prey. \nSuddenly Conan shifts upright, looking more sober than he did a moment ago. \nCONAN (CONT'D) But drink? Haven't had a drop all night. \n", "test1_id": 78, "test2_input": "TAMARA What does that mean? \nCONAN Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and Queens claim more lives than I will ever meet, and not a drop is spilled in their presence. \nTAMARA What are you talking about? I've done no harm to you. I've done no harm to anyone. \nConan confronts her, enraged. \nCONAN You lie. You are the very reason my people are dead. \nTAMARA Are you mad? I never met your people. \nCONAN But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed my people, looking for you. \nSuddenly Tamara understands. \nTAMARA The one who came for us? His name is Khalar Singh? \nCONAN You know this. \nTAMARA We did not know who sought us, only that we were sought. \nCONAN You hid from him. And while you did, others died in your place. \nTAMARA If we did not hide, countless more would have been killed! You do not know what purpose he has for our queen. \nCONAN And I do not care, for he will not live to see it bear fruit! \nTamara is shocked. \nTAMARA Wait -- you seek to kill this Khalar? We have the same aim. He takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I have sworn an oath to protect her. I can help you. \nCONAN Enough lies. \nConan puts the gag back in her mouth and binds her hands. \nEXT. ROCK RIDGE - NIGHT \nConan watches the Great Wall silently, absently playing with a DAGGER in his hand as he gauges the many guardposts along the wall. The archers. The barrels of oil. The cavalry. \nHe feels eyes upon him and looks down at Tamara, still bound and gagged, her eyes burning holes in his forehead. Conan pulls out her gag. \nCONAN You will keep quiet. \nTAMARA What use is talking? You won't believe a word I speak. I only want to know this -- how will you kill Khalar? You are too big to play the assassin. \nCONAN You will be the lure that will draw me close. Then I will scale the wall and cut him down where he stands. \nTAMARA And the archers and cavalry? They will be napping? \nCONAN They will not be a problem. \nTamara thinks about it. \nTAMARA No. Not good enough. \nConan is shocked by her brazen response. \nCONAN Did I ask? \nTAMARA Should you fail, I'll be left without a weapon, helpless in my enemies hands. Let me help, Conan. \nConan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth. \nCONAN I will not fail. \nBut still Tamara glares at him -- and we can see the hint of Conan's resolve bending. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GREAT WALL - DAY \nKhalar Singh stands atop the wall, awaiting Conan. Fariq draws close. \nFARIQ Let me take care of this thief, father. He's beneath your notice. \nKHALAR SINGH He killed Remo, likely his cavalry legion as well. Whatever he is, he is more than a mere thief. \n", "test2_true": "CONAN AND TAMARA \nConan holds a squirming, but bound Tamara. \nCONAN Be still! \nConan thrusts Tamara in Khalar's direction. \nCONAN (CONT'D) (yelling to Khalar) I have what you want! Where's my gold?! \nKHALAR \nKhalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins. \nKHALAR SINGH (YELLING BACK) Triple your price. Come and claim it. \nGATES OF THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER \nThe gates open and Khalar strides out into the clearing. \nCONAN AND TAMARA \nstand a hundred feet ahead. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Send her to me. \nCONAN Send the gold. \nKhalar Singh throws the gold sack. It lands halfway between them. He sends Tamara ahead, her mouth gagged. \nBut the moment Tamara reaches the gold -- \nFrom out underneath the sand, FOUR HORSEMEN rise up out of the desert floor. They each bear weighted nets and spiked lances, and they surround Conan. \nThe first rider gallops towards Conan who simply LOPS OFF THE HORSES FRONT LEGS. As the beast collapses, Conan crushes the rider's skull with his broadsword. \nThe next two riders attack together, but Conan dodges their nets and rips away one of their spears, only to lodge it into the other rider's chest. He dives at and tackles the first rider, TOPPLING HIM, ALONG WITH HIS HORSE. He snaps the second rider's neck. \nThe last rider comes at Conan, who horizontally slashes RIGHT THROUGH THE HORSE'S NECK AND THEN THE RIDER'S NECK. Both human and animal head tumble to the desert floor. \nAll four riders are dead, in a matter of seconds. \nKHALAR \nSmiles. He's got Tamara by the neck. \nKHALAR SINGH You're fast. But are you fast enough? \nConan's eyes go to the top of the wall, where CHEREN and his archer prepare to fire. Conan rushes forward as the flaming arrows stream toward him. \nEXPLOSIONS rip through the air where Conan was, throwing up a huge dust cloud. \nConan bursts out of the dust cloud, lunging in an attack. \nBut Khalar Singh is not there. He has withdrawn inside the gates. \nBaring his teeth, Conan runs at the wall itself. \nCheren and the archers let loose another volley at Conan, who evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword. \nExplosions fill the air, but none of them scorch Conan as he REACHES \nTHE GREAT WALL \nConan hits the base of the wall at full stride, like a mountain lion. Reaching out, he launches himself up, taking half the vertical of the wall in a single leap. \nDigging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams, he stops only to vault up again, taking the forty foot wall in two upward bounds. \nWALL WALK \nConan leaps upon wall walk, the passageway atop the Great Wall. \nFARIQ \nTries to hide his surprise. Even as he draws his sword, Conan takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way. \nFARIQ You should have run, while you could. \n", "test2_id": 79, "test3_input": "Conan meets its eye. \nCONAN (CONT'D) Do not test me, beast. \nTAMARA Is there not a living thing you can be at peace with? \nThey ride into the city, past the troops. \nEXT. KHOR KHALBA CITY - ENTRANCE - DAY \nConan and Tamara walk through the town's teeming market, a otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices, veiled faces and not a hint of morality. \nSTRANGER \nA FIGURE, his form hidden beneath a cloak, spots Conan and Tamara as they enter, and begins to follow them. \nWOODEN PLATFORM \nThe city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the plateau. There stands a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a massive winch, unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising back up to the fortress above. \nCONAN It's probably only way into Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is heavily guarded at all times, day and night. \nTAMARA So we must try to scale the cliff. \nCONAN And dodge arrows as we do so? \nConan motions up to the winch. Standing beside it are a half dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS. \nCONAN (CONT'D) During the day, we'd easily be spotted on the climb. And it would be useless to even attempt at night. No, we must find another way. \nSTRANGER'S POV \nAs Conan continues around the base of the mesa, the Figure following Conan is joined by TWO OTHERS. \nALLEYWAY \nConan and Tamara reach a less crowded area of the village when a VOICE rings out behind them. \nVOICE (O.S.) Halt. \nConan spins, sword at the ready. From out of the shadows comes a pair of MEN, their beady eyes fixed on Tamara. \nCONAN Thieves. You'll regret finding me. \nVOICE (O.S.) I think not. \nFrom out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF, the same one who Conan saved from Lucius' beatings. He smiles at Conan, lifting a KEY from a rope around his neck \nONE EYED THIEF It took longer than you think to cut this out of Lucius' stomach. After all that work, I figured I'd keep it -- for old times' sake. \nINT. THIEVES' TAVERN - AFTERNOON \nA rundown hall, built beneath the city. Wooden supports hold up the buildings of the entire city block overhead. \nAnd within the hall, a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES. They're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or even hands, evidence of Khalar's cruel justice. \nThey eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, WENCHES and SERVING WOMEN their cautious eyes following the Cimmerian outsider. \nThe One Eyed Thief takes them to an open table, and immediately three of the serving women descend upon Conan, caressing him. \nTamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a COUGH, even as a SERVING GIRL delivers mead to the table. \nConan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile women, their breasts practically framing his face. \nCONAN What? Do you wish to join in? \nCUT TO: \nConan cleans mead from his face, scowling at Tamara, as the One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress. \nONE EYED THIEF --so you were right about the platform. You'll be long dead before you make it top. Same with scaling the cliff. There's no known way to break into the fortress. \nCONAN So that's it? \nONE EYED THIEF I didn't say that. I just said there's no known way in -- because no one has ever tried to. But breaking out -- that's another story. It's not much easier, but it's possible. \nThe One Eyed Thief offers the same gap-toothed grin. \n", "test3_true": "INT. SEWERS - NIGHT \nTamara is the last to follow Conan, the One Eyed Thief and the three THIEVES from before down a short ladder. Below lies a darkened catacomb, lit only by their torches. \nONE EYED THIEF These catacombs run underneath the entire city, even to the cistern that drains out from the fortress dungeon. \nTamara's foot drops into knee high water. She immediately grabs her nose. \nTAMARA Catacombs? You mean sewers. \nONE EYED THIEF Piss and shit are the last things you need to worry about down here. \nTamara eyes the muddy water, nothing visible beneath its murky surface. \nINT. OTHER SEWERS - NIGHT \nThe group wades through the water, single file. Conan notices HIEROGLYPHICS and carvings on the wall of the catacomb. Massive creatures of the sea, dark sorcery, ritual sacrifice. \nCONAN What is it? \nTAMARA A warning. These catacombs are connected to the sea. It says that the beasts of Acheron protect its secrets. \nCONAN Not from me. \nConan presses on, into the darkness. \nINT. CISTERN - NIGHT \nThe catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its walls rising up high into the darkness. As the torches bring light to the space, we see HUNDREDS OF DEAD, ROTTING BODIES. \nAs Conan and Tamara walk forward, the One Eyed Thief and the other stop at the entrance. \nONE EYED THIEF Sorry, friend. We stop here. We've heard too much about what lies within to go any further. \nConan simply nods and the thieves depart. Conan raises his torch, illuminating the near wall. \nTAMARA Where now? \nCONAN Around. Up. \nConan heads off one direction, leaving Tamara to navigate the other half. Her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead. She inhales deeply and takes her first step. \nCONAN \nFollowing the slick wall, he passes many DEAD BODIES, but only one catches his eye. He stops before it. \nDEAD WARRIOR \nNothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats. But he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that resembles his father's own. \nConan takes the helmet and places it on his head. It fits perfectly. \nTAMARA \nTamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within. \nTAMARA Oh!!! \nTamara leaps up, swinging the torch down towards the water. Conan, nearby, unsheathes his sword. \nCONAN What? \nTAMARA Something touched me. Something slimy. \nConan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on Tamara's leg. It's a SLUG, which he flicks off. \nCONAN Crom! Stop wasting time. \nBut when Conan steps forward, something ROILS THE WATER right before him. He spots a HUGE TENTACLE just before its submerges back into the water. \nCONAN (CONT'D) Crom indeed. \nThen Tamara SCREAMS as another tentacle rises up from the water, wrapping around her waist. Tamara grabs hold of the wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater. \nConan immediately SLASHES the tentacle, pulling Tamara away. The squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with roiling intensity. \nConan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into the far cistern wall. \n", "test3_id": 80}

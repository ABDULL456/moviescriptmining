{"test1_input": "Conan looks at the sword. It strikes a chord in him. IT IS THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED! Enraged, Conan charges the slight Fariq. \nFariq partially parries the attack. He's obviously well- trained, but he's no match for Conan. The tip of Conan' blade cuts a large gash in Fariq's cheek. \nKHALAR SINGH Fariq! \nKhalar Singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and flinging him away from the barbarian. Fariq struggles to stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment. \nConan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall walk. \nCONAN I was wondering what it would take for you to stop cowering. \nKHALAR SINGH I wasn't cowering. I was studying. You're quite gifted with a sword, but it's not from schooling. Your speed and power makes up for a lack of -- finesse. I've seen such fighting before -- Cimmerian. \nEnraged, Conan charges Khalar Singh. He swings down on Khalar Singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds nothing but air. Khalar is fast. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Cimmerian it is. Now it makes sense. You came for blood, not gold. \nConan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a broad arc, with all his might. Even in the small space, Khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. He sidesteps Conan's attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his tulwar. \nConan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing Khalar could have just as easily sliced his throat. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Your people barely afforded me a challenge. You're little more than beasts. \nConan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury, smashing entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades the attack. \nDown the wall walk they move, Conan attacking while Khalar seems complacent enough just to defend. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) You've come a long way, barbarian, only to fail. \nKhalar ducks Conan's last wild swing and gashes Conan twice, both deeply in his midsection. Khalar then KICKS Conan, sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet. \nCRUNCH. Conan lands directly on his back, his sword clattering away from him. Khalar's men back away into a circle. Conan struggles to get on all fours. \nKhalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest, lifting Conan off the ground with his might. He follows up with a devastating punch to Conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver. CRUNCH. \nConan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) So much for vengeance. (to his soldiers) Get me oil -- and a torch. \nSoldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Is that really the best you could do? Is that as far as you could think ahead? Just rush in and kill me? \nBehind Khalar Singh, Conan spots Tamara being brought up, her hands bound. Her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as well. \nTAMARA' HANDS \nBetween the bonds she slips down a blade. It's CONAN'S DAGGER. She quickly cuts her bonds. \nWith all the attention focused on Conan, no one is quick enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER, LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHEREN'S QUIVER. \nCheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched arrows. \nCHEREN No!! \nBut it's far too late. Tamara hits the floor, beside Conan. BOOM. \nEXPLOSION \nThe blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction. Ukafa, Fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the concussion. \nKhalar Singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is THROWN AGAINST THE WALL! \nKHALAR SINGH \nThe warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire. \nHe grits his teeth and climbs the wall. \nATOP THE WALL \nA thick wall of flame rages before Khalar. Conan and Tamara are gone. He looks over the far side of the wall, where two figures on horseback ride off into the distance, Tamara holding Conan atop the horse. \nUkafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees. \nKHALAR SINGH Ukafa, you will take half our forces North, to the Sea. I will take the rest South. \n", "test1_true": "KHALAR SINGH You will return to Khor Kalba. You will feed the women to the beast until you find our Queen. \nFARIQ I will not. I will track the barbarian with you -- \nEnraged, Khalar Singh grabs him by the back of his head, pulling him in close. \nKHALAR SINGH You think I care what you wish?! You want to play warrior? It is not in you. One day you will be king, but warlord, never. \nFARIQ I can. Let me prove it to you! \nKHALAR SINGH You will not risk your life again. You are my line, my successor. You will not throw away all that I have worked for. \nA smile creeps up on Ukafa's face, watching Fariq's embarrassment. He withdraws hastily, all eyes on him. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) (without looking at Ukafa) If I find you smiling before you bring me the girl, I will take every tooth I see. \nUkafa buries the smile as Khalar turns to the wall of flames left in Conan's wake. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT \nThe flames become the blaze of the forge. \nCORIN (O.S.) More wood boy! We must test the steel with our fire. \nConan, a young boy again, kneels beside the woodpile, pulling OUT LOGS-- \nBut when he hands them to his father, he notices his father is covered with sword wounds, cut and bleeding. \nCORIN (CONT'D) What are you waiting for? The fire is dying. \nConan turns back to the wood pile. Instead of wood, the pile is full of the bodies of those he recently killed: Lucius, Remo, etc. \nThe young Conan struggles to push the first body onto the forge. Still the fire diminishes. \nConan turns and there is no more wood. And no more bodies. \nCONAN It's not enough. I've failed you father. \nCORIN It will never be enough, Conan. \nCONAN I don't understand -- \nHe spins. Behind him TAMARA stands, a look of sadness on her face. \nCORIN Through suffering, you will learn your purpose, boy. And you have not begun to suffer yet. \nINT. ROOM - NIGHT \nConan's eyes pop open. He inhales sharply, gripped by the dream. \nThe room is dark, surrounded by thick draperies. Conan lies on a straw bed with white sheets, soaked through with his sweat. He looks to his wounds, all bandaged. \nHe rises--a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed. \nTAMARA I wouldn't move so fast. I bound your wounds as best I could, but I'm no healer. \nConan looks over to discover Tamara sitting nearby. \nCONAN Where am I? \nTAMARA On the Wasp. You told me where it laid, just before you passed out. Though I can't say as I feel much safer here. \nConan's response is to rise again, his face contorting in pain. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Don't embarrass me with thanks, I only saved your life. \nCONAN You were -- adequate. \nConan pulls aside one of the thick draperies that surround his bed. Behind it lies a staircase, which he ascends. \nEXT. ZINGARAN GALLEY - NIGHT \nConan steps out onto the deck of a sixty-foot djunk, traveling quickly down a wide and powerful river. \nARTUS Look what we have here. A hill ape in over his head. \n", "test1_id": 78, "test2_input": "Terrified as she is, the young monk says nothing. Fariq closes the box. \nFARIQ (CONT'D) No? Your fear is not enough yet? Let's try harder. \nFariq nods to the slavers, who unchain her from the rest. \nFARIQ (CONT'D) I've read all there is to know of mighty Acheron. Why would true Acheronians protect a traitor to their own? You once held the entire world in your grasp, now you hide and cower like pitiful mice. \nHe pushes the girl. She falls to the grid, the sound echoing down into the pit. \nAN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness. Something comes. The girl looks below. \nFARIQ (CONT'D) And mice are meant to be swallowed whole. \nSuddenly, a MASSIVE TENTACLE, ten times the size of the one in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. It grabs the young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the darkness below. \nHer SCREAMS echo. \nFARIQ (CONT'D) What was in the box could only drink from you one at a time. But the beast of Acheron, it will claim four of you this night. (MORE) \nFARIQ (CONT'D) Who will spare the rest and tell me which of you is the queen? \nNot a single woman moves, resolved. Ilira catches herself, but also stays silent. She looks up to see Fariq staring at her. \nCU - ILIRA'S EYES \nHer pupils widen in fear as Fariq's cold stare bores into her. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) I am here, swine. \nFariq turns -- only it is another FEMALE MONK that glares at him. \nFEMALE MONK I am the one you seek. \nFariq smiles. \nFARIQ At last. Some bravery. But of course, you wouldn't expect me to take your word, would you? \nAs the Fariq reaches for her-- \nCUT TO: \nINT. GALLEY - ROOM - NIGHT \nTamara awakens with a SCREAM, her body resting against the curved hull of the ship. \nTAMARA No!!! \nTamara looks around with a panicked look, until she realizes where she is. \nCONAN (O.S.) I hope I awoke with less clamor. \nTheir roles reversed, now it is Tamara's turn to see Conan sitting nearby, drinking from a flask of mead. \nTAMARA You're drinking? You were near death this time yesterday. \nCONAN Is there a better reason to drink? \nTamara actually manages to LAUGH. \nTAMARA Do you think--I could try some of that? I'm curious of its taste. \nCONAN You've never tasted mead? \nTamara shrugs, embarrassed. Conan hands her flask. She takes a deep swallow, some spilling out over her cheeks. But she doesn't cough, and smiles brightly afterwards. \nTAMARA It's good. \nConan reaches for the flask, but Tamara ignores him, taking another swig. It quickly loosens her tongue. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Let me ask you something. Once you've killed Khalar and claimed your vengeance, then what? You will be free from your ghosts. What of your future, Conan? \nCONAN I have no future. It died with my people, as I should have. \nTAMARA So your life is penance? For what, for living? And when you too die, what do you believe happens then? \nConan just shrugs, taking back the mead. \n", "test2_true": "Tamara, her tongue loosened by drink, laughs. \nTAMARA Nothing? I couldn't live without some kind of belief in the world after this. \nCONAN I believe in the cold of steel, the warmth of flesh. All else is fairy tales. \nTAMARA Perhaps. But I still die with faith in my heart, belief in something greater than one's self. What will you die with? \nCONAN Purpose. I die with purpose. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ZINGARAN GALLEY - MORNING \nTamara steps out onto the deck, grabbing her pounding head. Her first hangover. She hears a THUMPING sound, followed by ANOTHER, and walks towards the side of the deck. \nTamara looks overboard, to the water below. \nTAMARA'S POV \nTHE RIVER IS FILLED WITH BODIES! Bloated, they float in blood red water as flies buzz around them. One of them hits the hull of the boat. THUMP. \nTamara blinks, unsure if the vision is real -- but then she's joined by other PIRATES who gape at the bodies below. \nPIRATE 1 To stations! To stations! \nTamara turns and up ahead spies -- \nBLACK WARSHIP \nThe larger warship cuts through the water, manned by a legion of rowers. On the deck of the warship, UKAFA and his SPEARMEN stand. The SAILORS get the most out of the billowing black sails. The ship gains fast. \nTHE GALLEY \nConan exits his room, sees the danger. Artus appears at his side. \nARTUS What do you think? They have us outnumbered, but we might beat their speed. \nCONAN That is what they wish. They drive us to another force, approaching from the south. \nARTUS Then we fight? \nCONAN No. We give them what they think they want. (to the Pirates) About ship! Now! \nThe pirates leap into action, tacking and turning the galley with great speed and efficiency. \nTHE WARSHIP \nUkafa smiles, his gold teeth shining. The ship's CAPTAIN stands beside him. \nCAPTAIN They're turning to run. \nUKAFA Good. We only need stay close. \nTHE GALLEY \nIs turned around now, fleeing. ARCHERS from the Warship fire arrows that barely reach the Galley. The Pirates dodge the few that land on deck. \nTamara reaches Conan and Artus. She's worried to say the least. \nARTUS And now? \nCONAN Let us show them why she is called the Wasp. \nArtus smiles. He was hoping Conan would say that. \nTAMARA Why is she called the Wasp? \nARTUS Open astern! Load the stinger! \nThe Pirates rush to the back of the ship. \nTHE BLACK WARSHIP \nThe Captain stares ahead, confused. \nCAPTAIN They are doing -- something. \n", "test2_id": 79, "test3_input": "INT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT \nIt takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous doors. Khalar Singh rides in. Moonlight from the huge eyes of the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. Faces of demonic warrior statues. \nAt their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too numerous to count. \nTAMARA This is no empire, only a graveyard. \nKHALAR SINGH You see only with your eyes. \nKhalar nods to his men. Two Guardsmen take their torches and light other torches set in the walls. It sets off a chain reaction. As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing the true scope of this place. \nAn enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin. \nAnd at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL. The pool is empty. \nKhalar turns to his guards. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Close the gates and stay here. Send my son to me when he arrives. (motioning to two of them) You two, come with me. \nTHE ALTAR \nKhalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of purple-shaded rock. Around its edges are deep channels, for the blood of its victims. And on its four corners -- shackles of bone. \nKHALAR SINGH The Acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance, don't you think? For one to ascend to royalty, another must fall. \nWith the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds. \nTamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar absorbs the blow effortlessly. He throws Tamara upon the altar, his two guards shackling her in place. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) For a hundred generations the kings of Acheron were crowned, and the queens were sacrificed. \nKhalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar. Like a Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES. \nAnd from the box he lifts two items. A CROWN OF GOLD and A CROWN OF IRON. The crown of gold is magnificent, ornately detailed gold that glows in the firelight. \nBut the crown of iron is terrifying. Huge rough spikes extend from it in every direction. It looks more like a weapon than a crown. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) What a day for you. This morning you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you are a queen giving birth to an empire. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nBloodied and weary, Conan approaches the Skull Rock. He has nothing more than his sword, his loincloth and a small BURLAP SACK tied to his hip. \nHe stumbles, falling to his knees. His wounds have taken a grave toll. Still he stands and presses on. \nHe pushes on the doors. They do not budge in the least. He puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining to their utmost. Again -- no movement. \nConan backs away, taking stock of the surroundings. He climbs up the side of the rock. \nINT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT \nKhalar Singh CHANTS in Acheronian. Ancient, harsh words, as he lifts the two crowns overhead, offering them to the statues of dark gods all around. \nTAMARA Stop. You don't know what you are about to do. \nKHALAR SINGH But I do. For thirty years I have dreamed of this day. The day our people rise from the ashes. \nKhalar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown upon his head. As he does so, the light from the moon reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an unnatural glow. \nTHUMP-THUMP. A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. It sounds like the heartbeat of a giant. \nKhalar next places the iron crown around Tamara's head. She thrashes and struggles but to no avail. \nOnce the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP! The spikes around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE THEMSELVES INTO HER HEAD. She SCREAMS in agony. \nBlood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels around the edges of the altar. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) It begins. You give birth to an empire. \nEXT. THE SIDE OF THE SKULL - NIGHT \nConan climbs -- muscles straining -- slipping -- hanging on by one hand -- and climbing again. \nTHUMP-THUMP. The statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth does. Conan nearly slips, but keeps his grip. \n", "test3_true": "He reaches the eye of the skull. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nWith the moon over his shoulder, Conan stares down at the unholy sight before him. We pull back revealing Tamara, her blood draining from her body. \nINT. ACHERON CAVE - CONTINUOUS \nTamara, her face pale from blood loss, begins to pray in pained whispers. \nKHALAR SINGH It's good that you pray. Gods will be here soon. \nTamara struggles to speak, her body wracked with pain. \nTAMARA He'll--be---here--sooner. \nKHALAR SINGH Who? \nCONAN (O.S.) Me! \nKhalar turns to see the outline of Conan, framed by the moonlight, looking down at Khalar from atop of one the warrior statues. A thick vine dangles nearby, Conan's route down from the cave roof above. \nConan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before the altar. It is a killing floor. \nThe two Guardsmen leap for him, but Conan dispatches them with a pair of strikes. Both fall down dead. \nConan meets Tamara's eyes, a look of determination, assurance. He starts toward the altar. \nKHALAR SINGH I will say this for you, barbarian. You are hard to kill. \nCONAN Let her go. \nKHALAR SINGH You've faced me before and lost. What do you think has changed now? \nCONAN My purpose. \nConan lunges for Khalar, their swords meeting with a flash of sparks. They fight to a brief standstill when ---THUMP, THUMP. \nTHE ALTAR \nTamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her head. More blood pours forth. The blood in the channels speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the sacrificial pool. \nConan makes another movement toward the altar, but Khalar nimbly blocks his path. \nKHALAR SINGH You are strong, Cimmerian, but we both know you are not my equal. \nConan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off. \nCONAN Once you used my father to teach your son a lesson about strength. Now let me teach you. \nConan tosses out what is inside. It falls to the ground, rolling to Khalar Singh's feet. \nFARIQ'S HEAD \nKhalar looks down at the ground -- at the head of his beloved son, his eyes gone, replaced by molten metal. Khalar trembles in shock and rage. \nKHALAR SINGH No. \nKhalar reaches for the severed head, giving Conan a brief window to rush to Tamara's side. Conan tries to lift her off the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down. \nKHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Cimmerian!!! \nEnraged, Khalar CHARGES Conan throwing all his skill and force into an all-out attack. Conan simply sidesteps it, then shatters the bone shackle holding one of Tamara's wrists. Before he can shatter the other, Khalar charges again. \nKhalar swings, Conan spins, his blade catching Khalar's just inches from his face. Conan throws Khalar off him, knocking the warlord back ten feet. Khalar's attack is feral, uncontrolled. He's lost his balance. \nSpinning and striking blindly, Conan smashes the second shackle on her wrist. He continues his motion, bringing his sword around to meet Khalar's next strike. \nNow Khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and Conan the more polished warrior. Their battle takes them away from the altar. \nWith her hands free, Tamara struggles to pull the spikes out and remove the crown. \nTHE KILLING FLOOR \nConan repels another Khalar attack, this time striking Khalar's chest and drawing blood. The Guardsmen arrive from the other side of the cave, drawing their swords. \nKhalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the Cimmerian. \n", "test3_id": 80}

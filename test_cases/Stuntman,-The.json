{"test1_input": "19   ANGLE ON CAMERON \nDoubled up, holding his wrist in pain. The bracelet is still intact. He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above. 20   EXT.   OLD ABANDONED ROAD - DAY \nCameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the mountainous pass. He crosses a bridge. Through the arches of its low stone railing, he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing toward the sea. Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert. \n21   CAMERON'S POV \nIn the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him. \n22   ANGLE ON CAMERON \nHe clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from this hidden vantage. \n23   ANGLE ON ROAD \nThe speck grows larger. The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible now. Sunlight flashes from metal and glass. Cameron's apprehension suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him. 24   ANGLE ON CAMERON \nHe scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride. The Duesenberg roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust. Suddenly there is a screech of brakes. \n25   ANGLE ON CAR \nThe Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop. Running, Cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and climbs in beside the DRIVER. 26   INT.   CAR \nCAMERON Thanks.    I thought you didn't see me. \nThe driver, BURT, is a husky, red-haired man about Cameron's age and deeply agitated. Pounding his fist against the steering wheel, he talks half to Cameron, half to himself. \nBURT Damn it.    Screwed it up.   Lost my nerve. \nFishing a Vick's inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his nostril. \nBURT (CONT'D) Goddamn sinuses. Can't even see straight. \nCameron looks at him, puzzled. \nCAMERON You want me to drive? \nBurt whirls on him, enraged. \nBURT What the hell is that supposed to mean?! \nCAMERON (confused) No offense...thought you might... \nBURT Every one of you jerks is a goddamn hotshot expert! Thanks for the vote of confidence. If you think you can do any better, just come and try it! \nHe puts his boot in Cameron's stomach and shoves hard. \n27   EXT.   CAR \nCameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the momentum. \nStunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows. Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred- eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron. INT.   CAR - ANGLE ON BURT \nDriving with one hand on the door handle, his head halfway out the window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond. \n29   ANGLE ON ROAD - CAR AND CAMERON \nCameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. His hand closes over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. The big spinning tires brush him as they pass. We catch a momentary glimpse of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield. \nAs he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed, expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. He opens his eyes, climbs to his feet. The road is empty. The Duesenberg is gone. Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be caused by the current. \n30   ANGLE ON CAMERON \nHis thoughts racing. Was it the sun, has he imagined the whole thing? Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears, hovering, almost at eye level. Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe. \n31   WIDER ANGLE \nIt is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. It has swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing, catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide. FOUR MEN Can be seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water, hovers. Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks, away from the road. \n32   CAMERON - MOVING SHOT \nGlancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a STAKE TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident. In the back, THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits. They look, from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each other. Cameron runs on. \n33    EXT.   BLUFF - OVERLOOKING SEASHORE TOWN \nA few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. There is a fishing pier, boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with sunbathing TOURISTS. The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION CRANE, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the sandy cove. Cameron appears on the bluff. \n34    ANGLE ON CAMERON \nSurveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours. He reaches down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. He pulls off his worn boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the town below. There are crowds to get lost in down there. He unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward the town. 35    EXT.   BOARDWALK \n", "test1_true": "35A   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK \nA BIG CROWD has formed at the railing of the pier. Many of the people with CAMERAS CLICKING at the sand below. Cameron notices the helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open cockpit BIPLANE. It is a WORLD WAR I FIGHTER with BRITISH INSIGNIA. \n35B   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK AND SKY \nCameron works his way through the crowd. All eyes now look upward at the plane. A LOUD VOICE is HEARD coming through an electric BULLHORN. \nVOICE All right, people. Quiet! We're losing the sun! This is a take! You're welcome to watch, but please, no flashbulbs. They'll spoil the shot. \nCameron's world has become more ordered again. It's a film company shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg. His eyes go to the scene below. 36   ANGLE ON COVE \nA CAMERA RIG suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane is PHOTOGRAPHING the surf where EXTRAS in German WWI uniforms unload ashore. The bright little plane has started a lazy dive toward the soldiers, its engine whining. From here it looks as fearsome as Snoopy and the Red Baron. \n37   ANGLE ON THE BEACH \nAs the British plane pulls out of the dive, there is a tremendous explosion. In the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats, ammunition and people are blown sky-high. The smoke from the exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene. 38   ANGLE ON CROWD \nThe onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their pleasure turns to horror and disbelief. 39   ANGLE ON COVE \nAs the smoke lifts, the Tom and Jerry violence has become a horrifying reality. Bodies are scattered about. One man has been severed in half, drenched in blood. Chunks of meat, arms and legs litter the beach. 40   ANGLE ON CROWD \nParalyzed by the sense of catastrophe. \nMAN (shouting) Something went wrong. \nThen, people begin to moan and scream. \n41    CLOSE ON CAMERON \nStaring tensely at the carnage.      By reflex, a shout escapes his lips. \nCAMERON Medic!   Get the medics! 41A   A WOMAN sags into a faint.      A small child in the crowd is crying and clutching Cameron's leg. \n42    ANGLE ON COVE \nAs the scene continues we hear a voice on the Bullhorn. \nVOICE (O.S.) Cut!   I said CUT! That's a print. \nSuddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene, absurd farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin wriggling out of the sand where the extras were partially buried to create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human beings before our eyes once again. \n43    ANOTHER ANGLE \nThe crowd reacts in various ways. Sighs of relief, laughter, anger. The exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their trouser legs. \nA.D. (yelling) Beautiful, Harvey. You gave everybody a heart attack. \nHARVEY, the Second Unit Director, yells back. \nHARVEY Eli will hate it. He said he wanted the shot in one? Now watch, he'll do six hours of pick-ups. \nThe crowd disperses.      A TOURIST turns to Cameron. \nTOURIST Great...but why do they always use so much blood? It ruins the realism, don't you think? \nCAMERON (still shaken, quietly mutters) ...asshole... \nThe tourist stiffens as Cameron turns away, his attention now drawn by the beating sound of the helicopter. He glances up. 44   CAMERON'S POV \nThe helicopter is descending toward the beach while the FILM CREW rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a landing site. \n45   ANGLE ON FISHING PIER \nWary of the men in the chopper, Cameron is moving down the pier away from the landing site. Suddenly he stops short, caught by something he sees O.S. Excitedly he points and begins to shout. \nCAMERON Hey!    Hey you...! 46   CAMERON'S POV \nBelow him, walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the same red hair, the same old British army jacket as Burt -- the man in the Duesenberg. Hearing the shout, the actor stops and tentatively turns. It's a mistake. Clearly the features are different. It's not Burt. 47   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CAMERON \nCameron is puzzled. He watches as the red-haired actor looks about to see who called and finding no one, starts off, but is stopped by a LITTLE OLD LADY holding a parasol and offering her autograph book. \nLITTLE OLD LADY Mr. Bailey! Aren't you Raymond Bailey, the actor? Would you please sign your autograph? Write 'to Emily...for eternal peace.' \nRaymond signs the book with the easy charm of a man who's done it a million times. He has those special rugged good looks that belong to Marlboro men and movie stars. \nLITTLE OLD LADY (CONT'D) I'm certainly glad you're all right. I lost my husband and my son in the wars... \nThe sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers for a landing. The Old Lady snatches her autograph book and heads for the landing site. \n", "test1_id": 2748, "test2_input": "Hands reach in and drape a sash around Nina's throat. From it dangles a SWASTIKA. For Nina, there is still no voice, no camera, only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned into her father's memory. And yet, that shame is so similar to the shame she should be feeling as the woman in Eli's film at this mockery of her son's death. \nVOICE (CONT'D) A nation has lost a son! A mother has lost a son! \nThe sound has now grown to a proportion reminiscent of those German newsreels of Hitler victory rallies. \nVOICE (CONT'D) This sacrifice in blood brings closer man's noblest dream...a thousand years of peace! \nThe THUNDEROUS SOUND of ten thousand voices shouting: \"Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!\" has shattered Nina's isolation. She is now aware that her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick, and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame, ironically making her performance even more poignant. The crowd on the playback roars with fanatic zeal. \n164   EXT.   HALL - CLOSE ON CAMERON - LATER \nStriding rapidly down the hall, looking like a man who hopes to find a fight, to dissipate his residual anger. He rounds a corner, almost colliding with Eli, who comes rapidly from an intersecting corridor. Eli puts his arm around Cameron's shoulder, hurrying him along even faster. \nELI Giddyap, soldier.   Last one there's on Medicare. \nCameron shrugs his arm off in annoyance as they round the corner and hurry down some STAIRS. \nCAMERON Where are we rushing to?    I Was asleep... \nELI Trouble staying awake, huh? \nThey reach the bottom of the steps and move swiftly down another corridor, as Eli fishes through his pockets and comes up with a PIECE OF CHEWING GUM. \nELI (CONT'D) Stick of gum? Makes you hum! (ignored, he chews it himself) Do you read? \nCAMERON Short words. \nEli finds a BOOKLET he has been looking for and hands it to Cameron. \nELI Schickel and Bergenstadt... couple of Dutch comedy writers. See, it's got pictures. But don't skim. Chuck's gonna quiz you. If you pass, you get a free trip to Amsterdam and you can stick your finger in a dike. \nCAMERON (looking at the book as he walks) What the hell is this? \nELI A pamphlet on how to get out of a sunken car. You know, they got this problem in Holland...those canals. So these guys are experts. \nCAMERON Did Burt read this? \nELI Off hand, I'd say no, wouldn't you? \nCAMERON (hands it back to him) \nNo chance. \nELI There you go rejecting me again. \nEli pushes open the double doors and they find themselves standing in the MAKESHIFT SCREENING ROOM. \nELI (CONT'D) You've gotta think positive, Burt. 165   INT.   SCREENING ROOM \nJake is there with SEVERAL OTHER MEN. But before Cameron can even register who they are, Eli is saying... \nELI I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I've got exactly two minutes of borrowed time. I'm in the middle of a scene. (to projectionist) Get it started. \nImmediately the lights snap off and the film is projected on the screen. In the dark, the men in the room fumble their way to seats. On the projection screen we see a helicopter SHOT OF THE DUESENBERG APPROACHING THE BRIDGE. Cameron is suddenly alert like a jungle beast who's just heard the trap slam shut behind him. His eyes dart around at the official-looking faces staring at the O.S. film. One face looks disturbingly familiar, but in the dark he can't place it. \nJAKE (addressing a man next to him) This fellow here is the stunt man driving that car. (to Cameron) Thompson is from the FBI. They wanted you here in case they have any questions. \nOn the projection screen, we see the DUESENBERG GO OFF THE EDGE OF THE BRIDGE, disappear in the water. \nTHOMPSON I don't see anybody else on the road...did you, Burt? \nCAMERON No. \nThe MAN Cameron couldn't recognize speaks out. \nOTHER MAN My buddy and I saw that son-of-a- bitch break out of the woods and head that way, down the road. \nThe lights go on and Cameron looks at the speaker, recognizing him as one of the TELEPHONE LINEMEN. Apparently, the lineman doesn't recognize Cameron in his new identity. \nLINEMAN ...I had a clear view.     I was on top of the pole. \nTHOMPSON Do you mind if we see that again? \nELI Help yourself, the room is yours. But I've got thirty people on the set being paid for doing nothing. (moving toward the door and calling) Come on Burt, you've got some reading to do. \nCameron follows Eli as the lights go out and the film begins again. \nJAKE Hey Burt, glad you're still alive, considering who you're working for. \n166   INT.   HALL \n", "test2_true": "ELI Something wrong?     Why are you lagging? \nCAMERON I'm trying to figure it out.       That film. Where was I? \nELI How tall is King Kong? \nCAMERON Three-foot-six. \nELI Good boy. I got all kinds of versions. Wanna go back and see some? \nCameron understands the implied threat and Eli, knowing he has made his point, continues good-humoredly. \nELI (CONT'D) I've even got a version where you fly the helicopter and I'm driving the Duesenberg. It's a dilly. 166A   They have now charged out of the building and are racing across the grounds toward the set. \nCAMERON What about the version where I go over the bridge and die in the water? \nELI (chewing gum) Hey, kid, what is this with you? That red dye must be eating through your scalp and affecting your brain. Why would I want to hurt you? \nCAMERON Because you don't like my tatoo. \nELI I think it's beautiful. It's heroic! I think it's a major work that may rank with the Edsel grill! Now goddamnit, I gotta go back and do my picture! Will you take this thing and read?! \nHe holds the booklet out to him and it is very hard for Cameron to reach out and take it. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the FBI MEN leaving the building, heading off in another direction. He stares at the booklet. \nCAMERON (softly) I knew a guy...who stepped on a bouncing Betty booby trap. Stepping on it wasn't his problem...they explode when you step off. So all \nhe could do was just stand there. It was getting light. If we didn't get out, we'd of been shot up. So we left... \nEli has been watching him thoughtfully. \nCAMERON (CONT'D) ...He had this screwy West Texas accent, I remember, \"Hey fellas...hey fellas...\" \nEli blows a BUBBLE with his gum that POPS on cue as though it were the explosion of the bouncing Betty. Grinning, he sticks the booklet in Cameron's shirt pocket, turns and walks off. \n167   ANGLE ON ELI - MOVING SHOT \nSam catches up and walks beside him toward the set. \nSAM Why don't you let the kid go before he gets hurt? \nELI Chuck keeps an eye on him. \nSAM He's dangerous to have around. Stop playing games, Eli. Tell Jake you've replaced him. What are you so hooked on? \nELI He helps me understand the kid in our story. \nSAM Bullshit. \nELI He's like one of those land mines left over from a war, that go off from time to time. You read about it in the paper two or three years later...some kid in a bell tower shoots a dozen students for no reason at all...his mother says he was always such a good boy...I guess I'd like to know what he really did. \nAs they reach the set, Gabe, the cameraman, charges up. \nGABE Did you bring the tampax? Raymond's still acting like he's got the \"curse.\" \nELI (with black humor) You suppose Raymond knows how to drive a Duesenberg? \n168   INT.   NINA'S BEDROOM \nScattered about the room are suitcases, a wardrobe trunk, the almost completed packing for tomorrow's departure. Nina lies in bed staring into nothing, Cameron beside her. Each is talking aloud to himself, adrift in his private world, unaware they have lost contact with the other. The room is semi-dark, except for the nightstand light on Cameron's side, by which he studies the BOOKLET Eli gave him. \nNINA ...It was so unnecessary...For Christ's sake, I'm no shrinking violet...I've had my ass pinched black and blue by account execs for not showing enough enthusiasm for Vitalis. But this from Eli...it was so pointless...sadistic... \nCAMERON (reading) ...\"Open All windows slowly to keep pressure from caving in the roof, should an unexpected skid achieve aquatic consequences...\" That's kind of witty. \nNINA \n(still in her own world) ...Could've handled it later on. It doesn't look so raunchy after it's cut...Maybe I'd of got them stoned...something...but for Eli to trap them like that... \nCAMERON (eyes on the book) Beautiful...There's a second school of thought that says the first school is all wet. It says, \"Keep the windows rolled up tight and wait for the air bubble.\" \nNINA Say it was an accident...benefit of the doubt. But then to use me that way...like a gadget...Why would Eli do that? He's not a cruel man... \nCAMERON (not looking up) He's not a cruel man.   He's a crazy man. A maniac. \nNINA What? \nCAMERON (reading) \"The water pressure at two hundred feet can crush a man into the size of an egg.\" He wants to get that on film....so he's gonna kill me. \nNINA (jumping out of bed) What in God's name are you babbling about?! \n", "test2_id": 2749, "test3_input": "ELI (shouting) I'm registering a complaint! Thirty- two members of my company got V.D. from your local virgins. The Chamber of Commerce didn't say anything about that in their brochure. \nJAKE You can stop clowning, Eli, I've got a sworn complaint from this sailor... (jabbing his finer in Raymond's O.S. direction) ...Your man over there touched his genitals. 174   ANGLE ON RAYMOND AND NINA \nShe is snuggled against him tenderly, her open mouth kissing his neck and cheek. Raymond, although aware of his desperate situation, is too sick with self-loathing to respond. 175   ANGLE ON ELI AND JAKE \nELI Oh, Jake! Come on! You wouldn't know your anal invert from a hole in the ground. Raymond makes bad jokes, but they're not illegal. Christ, you've seen us all on the set...clowning around. 176   EXT.   POLICE STATION \nCameron stands, peering in through the big front window, feeling once again betrayed. It's like watching TV with the sound shut off. From here, Nina and Raymond are very convincing. Chuck leans against a lamppost, smoking a cigarette, as the charade goes on. \n177   INT.   POLICE STATION \nEli now going full blast. \nELI My company's been pouring sixty thousand dollars a week into this place, for which your mayor and governor seem very grateful! We paid enough in taxes and fees alone to buy you parking meters from here to the boardwalk! \nSAILOR (feeling it's all going wrong) Everything I said in that statement is the flat-ass truth! \nEli pays no attention, knowing that he's got Jake.     He gestures toward Nina embracing Raymond. \nELI Jake, I got a very horny leading lady who's got an early call and would like to spend some time with her boyfriend before she makes \"night-night.\" Now, can I please get 'em outta here before they really do something illegal...and in front of witnesses! \n178   INT.   HOTEL CORRIDOR - ON ELEVATOR DOORS - NIGHT \nIt's three o'clock in the morning. The corridors are empty as the elevator door swings open and Nina and Eli step out and move down the hallway, functioning on their last ounce of nervous energy. \nELI Sorry I had to put you through that. I know it was humiliating. \nNINA ...It was awful...I hated it.   But you did save that man's life. \nELI Yeah, that was really nice of me. I'm a nice person. I just wish I had the strength to go to his room and break his spine. On the last day of filming the queen decides to come out of the closet! Wouldn't that have made a lovely headline? You understand, of course, that the film would've been destroyed. Doing that to me... \nNINA Eli, what's wrong? \nELI Nothing serious.     Just a little self-indulgence.     Feel-sorry-for- Eli-time. \nEli, on the edge of nervous exhaustion, is actually close to tears. \nELI (CONT'D) I'm sorry, but you know...it's too goddamn much. Why's everybody on my back? When's somebody gonna say, \"There, there Eli?\" I'm really surrounded by friends, allies and you...\"What else can I do for your film, Eli?\" \nNINA (wounded) That's not fair. \nThey have reached a turn in the corridor where each would go his separate way. They stop. \nELI What's not fair...getting my feelings \"hurt?\" When did I lose you to that soldier boy, Nina? That nice, wholesome, swell-looking kid...wanted by every cop, the FBI and God knows who else, for God knows what crime. \nNina is paralyzed with shock. \nELI (CONT'D) Come on, Nina, those blue eyes have bedazzled our little girl. For Christ's sake, he reeks of blood. \nNINA You sound as crazy as... (she stops) \nELI (wryly) As who? \nNINA He thinks you're trying to... (she can't say 'kill') ...harm him. \nELI Any number of people are trying to harm him... \nHe walks off down the corridor. \n179   INT.   HOTEL BASEMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT \nPartly crated props and costumes, luggage belonging to the departing film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves. In the cavernous half-lit room, Cameron, once again the coiled, stealthy animal, moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases, pulling them aside, searching. Discovering one, he sets it on the floor. It's locked. With a metal bar, he breaks the lock and eagerly rifles the contents. Then, sensing a presence, he turns. There stands Nina at the base of the steps watching him. With only a glance to her, he goes on with his search. \nCAMERON How'd you know I was down here? \nNINA The desk clerk... \nHe finds a WALLET, opens it, getting to his feet triumphantly. \nCAMERON How about that for luck? Burt's from Idaho...no picture on the driver's license. \nCameron stuffs the wallet in his pocket, moving along the row of suitcases. He pulls out a duffel bag, unzips it, shaking the \ncontents on the floor. Now with the open bag on his arm, he goes along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket, stuffing in things he will need: a pair of hiking boots, a couple of work shirts, a heavy jacket. Passing a shelf of bayonets, he picks one out and throws it in the bag. \nNINA (quietly) Who are you? \nCAMERON (ignoring the seriousness) Name it... \nAbove the bayonets are army helmets.    He tries one on. \n", "test3_true": "CAMERON (CONT'D) ...You tell me this wouldn't work? A pretty nurse pushing a vet in a wheelchair? When we hit that roadblock, we'd have 'em crying like babies. \nNINA (quietly) Who the hell are you? \nCAMERON Somebody trying to stay alive...anybody--that can get past the dogs and the quicksand... (making a shrewd guess) Who did Eli say I was? \nNINA I'm asking you, God damn... \nShe has fiercely grabbed his naked shoulder. \nCAMERON Easy with that tatoo...it mighta lost me Eli, but it won me Lt. Emily Schmidt, the greatest boobs in Southeast Asia...and a very patriotic chick. So I got this tattoo, for 28 bucks. And when she saw this shoulder, let me tell ya, holy Jesus! Following which I got the clap from the Lt. And hepatitis from the tattoo needle. You know what bothers me? I think Emily is gonna be very offended by Eli's picture. \nNina cannot endure another moment of this charade. \nNINA Why do they want you?   What did you do? \nCAMERON Eli'd tell you...I was a soldier. I did the same as everybody, just one of the boys... emptied my M-16 at any sound... don't know whether I killed gooks or cherries...the new kids from the States, we call 'em cherries, which they were for maybe fifteen minutes. The dry season is when it really breaks loose. You get very tired. It's like falling asleep at the wheel. You close your eyes and it still goes on. You're killin' them, they're killin' you. Couldn't tell ya now what was real except I'm here. \nWe sense in him the fatigue he is describing, then, pushing aside that memory. \nCAMERON (CONT'D) Hey, once when things were rough and the grass ran out, I shot the hell out of a water buffalo. (he considers, then passes judgment on himself) Actually, I wasn't a bad soldier...better than most. Got lotsa pretty ribbons. Funny...sort of like when I did that first stunt and everybody started clapping... nothing like a slap on the back to ruin a man, blow his sense of proportion. So, I got home...and, uh...I guess I expected something. Nothing fancy, but... something, you know...a free car wash, double blue chip stamps, extra time on the parking meter... I don't know... Instead, people... uh, didn't seem too pleased. (trying to hide a lot of pain) In fact, they acted like I was gonna start killing babies... \nShe crosses to him, deeply moved. \nCAMERON (CONT'D) Shit. I was supposed to get married, run an ice cream parlor. (picks up his suitcases) I gotta go. \n179B   Although they're standing only a couple of feet apart, he lifts his hand tentatively, as if to wave goodbye. \nNINA ...What about the roadblocks? \nCAMERON I'll go through the woods. \nNINA Don't you suppose there'll be cops in the woods. \nCAMERON I suppose there are cops in the woodwork! But what the hell...it's a nice night. (he starts to go) \nLovers facing farewells have a gift for suspending time, and Nina speaks out, unable to let him leave. \nNINA I've always liked the woods at night. They're very romantic... You can hunt for truffles. It might be such fun, we'd just keep going. \nCameron can't afford to fall for her softness. \nCAMERON You said \"we.\" What about your two scenes? \nNINA That's true...One of them is three pages of me making a tunafish salad for an American flyer in 1917... And I've got to weigh that against losing the man I love. It's a big decision. \nCAMERON Nina, you're making me crazy. \nNINA I'm sorry. I'm a little crazy myself. I can't let you go and I don't even know who you are. (suddenly the dam bursts and all self-control is gone) Why are they chasing you?! What have you done? What happens to me in the woods? Will I need a bayonet too? 179C   He stands there, staring at her, his face suddenly savage. After everything, the lady is afraid of him. He picks up the duffel bag and moves for the door, then turns on her, punishing her with his words. \nCAMERON The charge was attempted murder. I bashed this cop's head in. It took the jury about two fucking minutes. It could of been worse. It could of been life. But the judge...he looked real nice at me, and said you were a damn good soldier, son...So he only gave me twenty years. No way! Enough!...You know how long I was in that prison -- nineteen months -- and then I was gone! I was gone! \nShe stares in shock and horror.   His anger is like ice. \nCAMERON (CONT'D) Caught me breaking into a store...oh, not to rob it...I went there to kill the bastard who owned it... \nNINA Why? \nCAMERON ...Because... 179D   Suddenly the ice turns to steam. His self-control shatters like glass. There in the basement of a 100-year old hotel, before an audience of one, Cameron ERUPTS, spewing out the memory of his mortification and crucifixion...not without the silent resignation of Jesus, but with the howling rage of a mad dog...Pluto with the rabies... \nCAMERON (CONT'D) ...Because...it seemed like a good idea to twist his fucking head off! Said I could be his partner when I got back...lyin' son of a bitch was \"real sorry things were slack...\" Slack my ass...he just didn't want me hangin' around because he was bangin' my old lady. So I go down and start bangin' on his door! (he starts pounding on the mirror) \nCAMERON (CONT'D) ...He's closed. It's two o'clock in the morning. I want to smash his face in and he's closed! \"OPEN UP, YOU BASTARD.\" \n179E   Cameron's fist SMASHES his own face in the dressing table mirror. His reflection crazes and falls to pieces. \nNINA (screaming) Your hand! \nCameron holds up his fist to her, shaking it in glee. \nCAMERON Bang! That bright, shiny front window went bye-bye! (reveling in his own insanity) ...Maybe he's screwin' her behind the counter...I climb in there screamin' \"WHERE ARE YA? Come out here and be a man! Where are ya? Behind that counter, you son-of-a- bitch?\" \nCameron kicks over the makeup table as though it were the counter...tubes and glasses shatter all over the floor. \nCAMERON (CONT'D) Ya know what's behind that counter?... (the ultimate horror) ...41-DIFFERENT-KINDS-OF-ICE CREAM...\" and all that fuckin' SYRUP!... \n179F   There is a rainbow row of makeup jars and hair tints. He starts HURLING them against the wall where they smash, punctuating his speech with bursts of gooey color. \nCAMERON (CONT'D) ...And these little Mickey Mouse faces on the walls!...with candy eyeballs!... \n", "test3_id": 2750}

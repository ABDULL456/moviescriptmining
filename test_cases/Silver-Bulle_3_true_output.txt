UNCLE AL Huh? 
MARTY What if it's some kind of monster? 
UNCLE AL (laughs) Jesus, Marty! Come off it! 
EXT.  UNCLE AL'S CAR, ON MAIN STREET 
It cruises past Owen's Pub. There are cars parked out front, but there are also lots of pickup trucks. 
INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL 
MARTY What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al? 
UNCLE AL A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies? 
EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  LATE AFTERNOON 
UNCLE AL'S car turns in and parks. 
INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL 
MARTY Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in that greenhouse. Growling noises, like a big animal. Her father was killed that night. 
UNCLE AL looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almost believing. Then he shakes his head. 
UNCLE AL Marty, you have to get this idea out of your head. Psychotics are more active when the moon is full, and this guy is a psycho. He's going to turn out to be as human as you or me. (Pause) In a manner of speaking. Now let's get you inside. 
He opens his door and gets out. 
INT.  MARTY, CLOSER 
He would like to believe UNCLE AL... but he doesn't. 
INT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE AFTERNOON 
ANDY FAIRTON Okay, you all know what group you're in and what area you'll be covering, right? 
PORTER ZINNEMAN Damn straight! 
ELMER ZINNEMAN Shut up, Porter. 
The men are all dressed in hunting clothes- red-and-black-checked shirts, orange caps, etc. They all have guns. Among their number are a few women as well, looking tough and determined. We see almost everyone we've met up to this point. LOWE is there, looking deeply troubled. 
ANDY FAIRTON is standing on the bar. These are his vigilantes; he has organized them. ANDY radiates male macho football-coach confidence. He's mesmerized the crowd: they really believe they are going to go out and Shoot One for the Gipper. 
ANDY Groups one through four are in the woods north of the Sturmfuller place. Five and six west of Carson Creek. 
The door at the back opens; HALLER and PETE come in. JOE HALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back much from the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sort of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has seriously weakened his authority. 
ANDY (continuing) Moonrise at 8:52 p.m. 
Some nervous laughter greets this. Meanwhile, HALLER and PETE are working their way to the front, where they end up next to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID. 
ANDY (continuing) If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker. 
INT.  THE VIGILANTES, WITH ELMER AND PORTER 
PORTER (happily) Damn straight! 
ELMER Shut up, Porter. 
INT.  ANDY FAIRTON 
ANDY Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not each other. So look before you- 
INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING HALLER 
HALLER I want all of you folks to go home! 
A disgruntled murmur meets this. HALLER moves forward a bit, and turns to face them. 
HALLER I can't remember deputizing a single one of you! 
INT.  ANDY FAIRTON 
ANDY That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one of you has done a damn thing about solving this case. 
There is a mutter of agreement. 
INT.  A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT, FEATURING ANDY AND HALLER 
ANDY hops off the bar to face HALLER directly. In the b.g. we see HERB KINCAID (KINCAID, by the way, should be wearing a black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral). 
HALLER (without much force) We'll catch him. 
ANDY You couldn't catch a cold. 
HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the crowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation. 
HALLER The law has a name for what you men are planning. It's private justice, and private justice is about a step and a half away from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's Mills, and I want you men to go home. 
They shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. He is getting to them. 
ANDY Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done since this thing started but hang his face out?

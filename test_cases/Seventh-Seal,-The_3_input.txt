LISA He is only a false beard, false teeth, false smiles, rehearsed lines, and he's as empty as a jug. Just kill him. 
LISA sobs with excitement and sorrow. PLOG looks around, a little confused. SKAT uses this opportunity. He pulls out a dagger and places the point against his breast. 
SKAT She's right. Just kill me. If you thought that I was going to apologize for being what I am, you are mistaken. 
LISA Look how sickening he is. How he makes a fool of himself, how he puts on an act. Dear Plog, kill him. 
SKAT My friends, you have only to push, and my unreality will soon be transformed into a new, solid reality. An absolutely tangible corpse. 
LISA Do something then. Kill him. 
PLOG (embarrassed) He has to fight me, otherwise I can't kill him. 
SKAT Your life's thread now hangs by a very ragged shred. Idiot, your day is short. 
PLOG You'll have to irritate me a little more to get me as angry as before. 
SKAT looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes towards the night sky. 
SKAT I forgive all of you. Pray for me sometimes. 
SKAT sinks the dagger into his breast and slowly falls to the ground. The travelers stand confused. PLOG rushes forward and begins to pull at SKAT'S hands. 
PLOG Oh dear, dear, I didn't mean it that way! Look, there's no life left in him. I was beginning to like him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too spiteful. 
JOF leans over his colleague. 
JOF He's dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact, I've never seen such a dead actor. 
LISA Come on, let's go. This is nothing to mourn over. He has only himself to blame. 
PLOG And I have to be married to her. 
JONS We must go on. 
SKAT lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast. The travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on the other side of the meadow. When SKAT is sure that no one can see him, he sits up and lifts the dagger from his breast. It is a stage dagger with a blade that pushes into the handle. SKAT laughs to himself. 
SKAT Now that was a good scene. I'm really a good actor. After all, why shouldn't I be a little pleased with myself? But where shall I go? I'll wait until it becomes light and then I'll find the easiest way out of the forest. I'll climb up a tree for the time being so that no bears, wolves or ghosts can get at me. 
He soon finds a likely tree and climbs up into its thick foliage. He sits down as comfortably as possible and reaches for his food pouch. 
SKAT (yawns) Tomorrow I'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll go to the saints' feast in Elsinore. We'll make lots of money there. (yawns) Now, I'll sing a little song to myself: (sings) I am a little bird Who sings whate'er he will, And when I am in danger I fling out a pissing trill As in the carnal thrill. (speaks) It's boring to be alone in the forest tonight. (sings) The terrible night doesn't frighten me ...

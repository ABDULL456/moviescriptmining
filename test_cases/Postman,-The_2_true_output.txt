THE POSTMAN 'Dear Irene. Sorry I haven't written. Everything's so crazy. The strange weather. The food shortages. That farmer Nathan Holn causing all that trouble. It's hard to understand. David's home from the Army. The war was over before he even got there. Thank God for that. He's still my baby no matter how big he gets. We're going to miss you for Christmas, but maybe next year. All our love. Donna.' 
Mrs. March reaches out a trembling hand to take the letter. 
MRS. MARCH My sister in Denver. Fifteen years ago. Thank you. 
The populace erupts with excitement.        Mrs. March takes The Postman's hand, clasps it tightly. 
MRS. MARCH You're a Godsend. A savior. 
The Postman pulls his hand back, rejects the title. 
THE POSTMAN No.   I'm just... a postman. 
An almost awesome silence.     Too much for The Postman. 
THE POSTMAN I've been on the road a while. I could use a little something to eat -- 
(CONTINUED) 
30   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             30 
MRS. MARCH Oh, yes, absolutely... Is there anything else? 
The townspeople welcome him with cheers. The Postman raises a silencing hand. As they quiet... 
THE POSTMAN Yes, there is! If there are dogs in this town, you have to leash them while I'm here! 
Only The Postman laughs. No one else reacts. Briscoe watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround The Postman and sweep him through the gates and into town. 
One couple watches The Postman closely as he makes his way into town. She is ABBY -- a sweet-faced, pretty woman. Her husband, MICHAEL, is a decent-looking sort, tall and strong. 
31   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                         31 
A freestanding tub has been set up, water "bucketed" in. The Postman luxuriates in his first hot bath in years and sings a familiar tune to himself. 
THE POSTMAN 'Stop. Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman. Waaa-ait, Mr. Postman...' 
32   EXT. PARKING LOT (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                          32 
FORD crosses the parking lot of an abandoned motel. He's a black kid, maybe 16, too young to remember any other life but this. He carries The Postman's uniform on a hanger. 
33   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                         33 
The Postman looks up at a KNOCK. Ford steps in. Like most kids, he needs a hero. Holding up the uniform, he just found one. 
FORD (beaming) Cleaned and pressed, sir. 
(CONTINUED) 
33   CONTINUED:                                                      33 
THE POSTMAN Thanks. Didn't somebody say something about dinner? 
FORD Yeah, I'm supposed to take you to Foster's. (extending a hand) My name's Ford. Ford Lincoln Mercury. 
The Postman just nods, hoisting himself out of the tub and hurriedly wrapping a towel around himself. 
FORD Used to be John Stevens, but I changed it on account of I want to drive cars. 
Hoping to impress, Ford reaches into a pocket, pulls out a worn, creased flyer for a "Ford Lincoln Mercury" dealership. Ford finds The Postman just staring at him, waiting for the uniform he's still got in his hand. Embarrassed, Ford quickly hands it over. 
34   EXT. STREET (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                                 34 
Ford leads the way as they leave the motel behind. The Postman looks good in his uniform. They cross a parking lot where five partly-stripped cars have been sitting for years. There's a potted plant outside the driver's door of one. 
FORD I live in that car. A 2003 Pontiac Sinatra. With a nine- banger and a Q-eight. 
THE POSTMAN V-eight. Eight cylinders.   That means an eight-banger. 
FORD (in awe of him) Were they fast? 
FORD A buck seventy-five on a strip. 
(CONTINUED) 
34   CONTINUED:                                                         34 
FORD A buck seventy-five? I thought maybe I could fix some of them up. It's nothing compared to what you do. 
This is the last thing he expected to hear out of this kid's mouth. A moment, then... 
THE POSTMAN The important thing to remember about cars is, you can't eat 'em. 
Ahead, people are gathered inside an old Foster's Freeze. 
35   INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                           35 
The townspeople fill the booths, line the walls. They talk excitedly amongst themselves, break into spontaneous applause as Ford and The Postman enter. 
The Postman is surprised, uncomfortable at this display. But then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the counter. The centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew. 
The PEOPLE clear a path for him. 
MAN #1 Tell us about the government! 
WOMAN #1 Yes, tell us everything! 
Startled, The Postman doesn't quite know what to say. They seat him at a table -- but the food looks miles away. 
MAN #2 Is there a President? 
THE POSTMAN Yeah. 
WOMAN #2 What's his name? 
THE POSTMAN You know, I'm pretty hungry.

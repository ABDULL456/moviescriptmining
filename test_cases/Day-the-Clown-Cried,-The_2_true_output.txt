GALT We might as well be outside. 
UHLMANN If I get pneumonia, I'll hold the government responsible! 
GUARD With a little luck, you'll both get pneumonia! 
The guard turns and moves towards the door, stops, and turns to see all is well, and exits the door, closing it behind him. 
Galt sits on the lower bunk as Uhlmann sprints up to the upper bunk and looks towards the original men, who are just standing around watching the two new "fish"... then men sense trouble and slowly and quietly return to their own bunks... some of the other men just stare at the two new prisoners... 
UHLMANN (sitting on his bunk) It's sure quiet in here... 
WIDER ANGLE 
Uhlmann in his surveying the barracks spots the potato plant on the window sill... next to the Stout Prisoner's bunk... he jumps from his bunk and runs over towards the plant... he takes it from the window sill and yells over to Galt... 
UHLMANN Hey, Galt!  Come over and look at this! 
GALT (coming over to Uhlmann) What is it? 
UHLMANN Ain't it cute? 
GALT It's a God damn posie! 
He and Uhlmann burst into laughter... 
UHLMANN Looks kinda sick, doesn't it? 
GALT (examining it) It's one of them potato things... and it sure as hell is sick! 
UHLMANN Maybe we should put it out of its misery. 
GALT No, we don't want to do that...  we might break someone's heart. 
He looks around at the other prisoners. 
GALT Whose little plant is this? 
The stout prisoner gets up from his bunk and starts to move forward and challenge Galt... but Keltner jumps from his bunk and gets to Galt first. 
KELTNER (with deep conviction) The plant is MINE! 
GALT Is it now?  Tell me precious... do you knit, too? 
KELTNER If necessary, I can... and I do ! 
This brings a ripple of laughter from the others... particularly the new prisoners who are delighted at seeing someone stand up to Galt for a change... Galt with a sneer on his face steps out into the aisle to face Keltner square on! 
GALT (to Uhlmann) What do you think of that, Uhlmann... he knits! 
UHLMANN Now, if he could just cook... 
Galt and Uhlmann laugh, but they are the only ones that do... 
GALT (coming out of the laugh) Can you cook, sweetheart? 
Keltner knows damn well he can't fight the brute, yet he realizes that if he steps down, life not only for him, but for the others in the barracks will be intolerable under Galt's bully rule.  (During the following dialogue, Adolf, Franz, Ludwig, Herman and the Stout Prisoner... easy up a little closer to Keltner and Galt.) 
KELTNER If necessary, I can cook, yes!  Now, if you don't mind, I'll take that plant! 
He holds out his hand... Galt, wearing a deceptive smile, eyes the older man... 
GALT Alright, old man, you really want it? 
He raises his arm over his head with the plant in that hand. 
GALT Go get it!! 
CLOSE - KELTNER 
He looks past Galt at Helmut who is sitting up on his bunk... 
CLOSER - KELTNER 
He looks at Helmut.  His eyes try to encourage Helmut to do something, say something, do anything to show that he is on Keltner's side. 
CLOSE - HELMUT 
He sits up on his bunk, and wants nothing to do with the bully and his pranks... so he goes back to studying his papers and looks up again to catch Keltner's look of disappointment, and as Keltner turns away from Helmut... Helmut realizes he should do something to show Keltner he, indeed, cares... he jumps down from his bunk and grabs Galt by the arm and turns him around... they are now face to face... 
HELMUT Why don't you pick on someone your own size... 
GALT (shocked, but pleased that he finally got a rise out of someone) What? 
HELMUT (firmly) You heard me!  Give him his plant back, and leave him alone...  He didn't bother you ... and if you have to show your muscle, there's plenty of other guys to pick on! 
GALT You're my size! 
... and with this, Galt smacks Helmut a shot across the mouth that sends him spilling into the corner, half knocked unconcious... he lays there with blood flowing from his mouth... 
Keltner leaves Galt and runs to the corner to see if Helmut is okay.  Galt follows him... Keltner is leaning down checking Helmut... as Galt bends down next to the two of them... still holding the plant. 
GALT He's alright... that'll teach him to keep his nose out of my business... here's your plant!

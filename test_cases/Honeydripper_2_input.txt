SONNY Sorry, folks- must of got kicked on the train. 
The audience is stone-faced.   Could this really be the man? 
Young Henry steps up and sits behind the DRUM KIT, pulling sticks from inside his shirt- 
Ty closes his eyes, begins to shake his head in defeat- 
China Doll looks worried, collecting another cover charge at the door- 
Delilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage, worried- 
Sonny holds his arms out wide, shifting his body to get the BUZZ under control- 
Dex leans to talk in Junebug's ear- 
DEX What's this fool playin at? 
Maceo isn't going to wait to find out. He grabs the wires with both hands, yanks- they hold firm! He looks to the stage, panicked- 
-as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp BLASTS the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering, ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO! 
Ty stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open- 
Sonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone- 
SONNY Gonna hold may baby as tight as I can Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty man! Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight! 
Sonny looks over to Ty, who catches himself and begins to play along. Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast shuffle on the skins- 
Ty looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to pull the wires out. Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off- 
SONNY Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight! 
Delilah smiles and presses her hands together, shooting a look upward- 
DELILAH Thank you, Jesus. 
Time Trenier has his case open now, the gleaming instrument in one hand, squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to the light with the other- 
SONNY Meet me at midnight behind the barn Don't you worry I'll do you no harm 
The crowd is already CLAPPING and STOMPING in time with the song. Henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to keep time- 
SONNY Make sure to bring my rockin shoes Tonight I'm gonna rock away all of my blues! 
Time Trenier screws the mouthpiece on, puts his horn to his lips and BLOWS right on the beat to take the sax break, walking through the parting crowd to the bandstand! 
Junebug grabs Opal's hand and they begin to DANCE a modified jitterbug, people spreading to give them room- 
Sheriff Pugh, hands still over his ears, sits in a corner paying special attention to Opal's hip action- 
As Time continues to blow, stepping up onto the stage, Sonny keeps urging Metalmouth Sims to come closer to his microphone with the harmonica. Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving- closer, closer- 
Metalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty, who nods from the piano, so he butts his harp smack against the microphone, takes a deep breath and HONKS his soul out, grabbing the break from Time! 
The audience goes wild, a half-dozen couples dancing now, others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat where they stand. Sonny shakes out the long CORD attached to his guitar- 
China Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new CUSTOMERS pressing in the door and dance at the same time, thrilled by the music. Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind her as she turns toward the bandstand- 
Metalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the guitar again, making it WAIL as he hops off the stage, steps up on a chair, then onto the bar counter! 
He walks the length of the bar, playing his ass off, hops down at the far end, grins at China Doll and heads out through the door, dragging extension cord behind! Lonnie and Scratch hurry to pull slack for him as he steps out into the NIGHT- 
72   EXT. ACE OF SPADES - NIGHT                                   72 Ham and a few other pickers stand outside Toussaint's, beers in hand, staring across toward the Honeydripper as Sonny steps out PLAYING with a CROWD behind him- 
HAM What the hell is that? 
Sonny steps out into the middle of the crossroads and plays, a CAR stopping short of running him over. 
He hops up on the hood and keeps playing, a TRUCK from the other direction stopping to blast him with its HEADLIGHTS. 
Sonny indicates with his guitar neck to the CROWD emptying out of Toussaint's that he wants them to follow, then hops down onto a big picker's back and is carried back in to the Honeydripper, still playing- 
HAM We got to check that out! 
A couple dozen patrons move away with him. We HOLD on the doorway as OLD MAN TOUSSAINT comes out to look, puzzled and angry-

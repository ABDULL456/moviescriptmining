EXT/INT: LATE NIGHT - KOREAN DELI 
LT approaches the market where he intends to buy the DIET COKES. 
A display of FRESH FRUITS & VEGETABLES extends onto the sidewalk. 
LT notices a SQUAD CAR, parked in front of the MARKET. LT picks up his pace. 
Closer now, LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside, standing with the KOREAN OWNER, an elderly man who doesn't speak much English. The OWNER is agitated and out of breath. He argues fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS. 
A SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET. 
LT gets an idea. He takes command. 
LT (to Cop) What's going on? 
The UNIFORMED COP is a timid rookie. 
COP Uh, Lieutenant, Sir -- The owner says they stole cash from the register. He was chasing them down the block when I caught up with them. 
The KOREAN OWNER is still agitated. He tries to give his side of the story, mixing English and Korean. At the same time -- 
The TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case. They try to drown out the OWNER. It all gets rather noisy. 
YOUNG BLACK KID We didn't do nothing, man ! 
LT shouts in the YOUNG BLACK KID'S FACE. It's shockingly loud. 
LT Shut the fuck up! 
LT turns to the UNIFORMED COP. 
LT (to Cop) Go get me a Bud. A High Boy. And make sure it's fucking cold. (indicates the situation at hand) I'll straighten this out. 
The UNIFORMED COP looks at LT for a moment, then goes. 
LT is now alone with the KOREAN OWNER and the TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS. 
LT turns to the OWNER. 
LT How much did they take? 
KOREAN OWNER Five hundred dollars cash. 
The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS continue protesting their innocence. 
YOUNG BLACK KID We didn't --

Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab Muslims.) 
WIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain. The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side, spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are two suns -- one red, one yellow. 
PARIS Well. Our own little slice of heaven. 
The Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to orient themselves. 
IMAM Please...which way to New Mecca? We must know the direction in order to pray. 
North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING inside the ship finally ends. 
INT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
As Fry holds Owens, now dead. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together, each faces a different compass point. 
EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Fry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza, Audrey are already here. 
JOHNS Big talk about a scouting party... 
Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship. One glance confirms that there are no other survivors. 
JOHNS (CONT'D) ...then we saw this. 
PARIS Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me? 
AUDREY Like I just ran, or something.... 
SHAZZA Feel one lung short. All of us. 
PARIS Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And with all this dust.... 
Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers. 
FRY It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to -- 
ZEKE So what the bloody hell happened, anyways? 
FRY Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know. 
SHAZZA Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking grateful. This beast wasn't made to land like this. But cripes, you rode it down. (to others) C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason we're alive is a'cuzza her. 
Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders. HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their savior. 
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Breaking out pressure suits: 
FRY Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last. 
AUDREY Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse? (off their looks) Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me. 
SHAZZA We're worried you'll scare us. (ushering her away) Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're goin' to Taurus Three like we were? 
AUDREY Yeah, but...do we even have enough food to get there? Or will we have to resort to cannibalism? 
ZEKE (to Fry) I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit further, cap'n. With your permission, a' course. 
Fry blinks. "They actually think I'm the captain." Zeke and the others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at another problem. Riddick. 
FRY And him? 
JOHNS Big Evil? 
FRY We just keep him locked up forever? 
JOHNS Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on -- 
FRY I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous? 
JOHNS Only around humans.

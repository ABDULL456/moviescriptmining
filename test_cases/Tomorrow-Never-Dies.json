{"train": "T O M O R R O W   N E V E R   D I E S \n(BOND 18) \nScreenplay by Bruce Feirstein \n(for educational purposes only) \nFADE IN ON: \nEXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN \nSuper: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN \nWe're looking down at what used to be called \"The End of the Known World.\" A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding. \nIn the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine. \nPushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging over a cliff: \nAN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid. \nPushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up the ice. A human figure. This is: \nJAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007. \nBond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but - \nCRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head: \nBOND There has to be an easier way to earn a living. \nStill, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until - \nANOTHER ANGLE - \nHe's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a toehold. But when he slams the second pick in - \nTHE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK - \nBOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK - \nAnd 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall. \nBond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum. \nAt the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at: \nTHE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL - \nBeginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying. \nRETURN ON BOND - \nCautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN. \nANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL - \nNow jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally frayed through. \nRETURN ON BOND - \nOne last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still, he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward. \nEXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL - \nExhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down - through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed. \nAs he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and - \nTHE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY - \nBreaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below. \nIN THE WATERBED - \nA torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge, he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland. \nNEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND) \nBond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff: \nBOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL - \nOn either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself. In other words: This was the only way in. \nRETURN ON BOND - \n007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold. \nHe presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow. \nEXT. SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES - \nEXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF - \nBond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below, amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down. \nEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - \nBond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to: \nA ROCK OUTCROPPING. \nHiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on: \nA SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV) \n50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES. \nNear a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side. \nBOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING - \nProps his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT. \nTHROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT - \nHe sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions. \nTHE SAME SCENE ON A VIDEO WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM, LONDON. \nBOND'S VOICE (over a speaker) Seven, in position. \nTANNER'S VOICE Roger, Seven. \nWatching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS, including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK, an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6. \nM deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him: \nM ... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?' \nTANNER Maybe. Maybe not. \nM Abort the cruise. \nADMIRAL ROEBUCK It's too late - \nM GET BOND OUT OF THERE. \nTANNER One to seven - one to seven - \nBOND - SQUINTING THROUGH THE RIFLE AT THE OUTCROPPING - \nBOND Negative, one. NOT YET. \nTHE TRUCK/MiG-l, ON THE GROUND/THROUGH THE SCOPE - \nTHE BALD MAN slaps the back of the truck obscuring MiG-1. THE TRUCK PULLS AWAY, revealing MiG-l's WING. Hanging from the weapons pod: A NUCLEAR BOMB. \nBOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING - \nMutters a curse. \nMI-6 SITUATION ROOM - \nTANNER Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton. \nM Will the cruise set it off? \nTANNER Yes. \nADMIRAL ROEBUCK (to Bukharin) Jesus. Can't you people keep anything locked up? \nGENERAL BUKHARIN We didn't know it was missing. \nM Get me the Prime Minister. Alert NATO, the CIA, the Pentagon. (presses a button:) Seven: This is a direct order. I want you out of there. Do you copy? \nTHE ROCK OUTCROPPING - \nBond's headset lies on top of the rock, along with the telescopic sight - still broadcasting. \nFind Bond, crouching BEHIND the rock. Automatic rifle in one hand, GRENADE in the other. He pulls the pin, hurls it 40 feet away. Pauses. Waits, counting down time. Then - \nBOND SPRINGS. SHOOTS at one of the CRATES. IT BLOWS UP, just as - THE GRENADE EXPLODES. \nThere's PANIC ON THE GROUND. Men running everywhere as THE RADAR/ GATLING GUN spins, and SENDS A HAIL OF FIRE at Bond's diversion. \nAnd with this, BOND is off, SPRINTING INTO THE CHAOS. \nTHE SAME SCENE - VIDEO SCREEN - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM. \nStoned silence. Disbelief. Tanner whispers: \nTANNER God help him. \nTHE CRUISE MISSILE - FLYING THROUGH A MOUNTAIN RAVINE - \nGod help the rest of us. \nTHE SECRET AIR BASE - \nAs various factions shoot at each other (Who's the traitor?) Bond streaks toward the action. Without breaking stride, he swings his gun to the right: TWO BURSTS. THREE MEN DIE. Still running, he swings to the left: ANOTHER BURST. TWO MORE DOWN. \nAhead, Bond sees the FLIGHT CREWS DASHING for the MiG's. He makes a beeline for MiG-1. \nANGLE ON THE BALD MAN - \nSlamming the gate on the RED BOX in a cargo truck. Rushing to the passenger door. Climbing in. The SHORT ROUND MAN floors the accelerator, driving them away. \nTHE CRUISE MISSILE - STARTING ITS DESCENT DOWN A MOUNTAIN \nMI-6 SITUATION ROOM - M, WATCHING HELPLESSLY - \nVOICE FROM WARSHIP Time to target: Thirty seconds. \nWIDE ON MiG-1 - \nThe pilot climbs the ladder to the cockpit. Running at full tilt, BOND LEAPS, pulls the man down. They fall to the tarmac, FIGHTING. Bond SHOVES A KNIFE in the man's ribs, killing him. \nKneeling, Bond takes the pilot's helmet off. He looks up: A MAN is coming at him with a GUN. In one unbroken move, Bond YANKS THE KNIFE from the pilot's body and THROWS IT - thwack - into the man's heart. \nANGLE ON MIG-2'S PILOT - WATCHING THIS FROM HIS COCKPIT. \nRETURN ON BOND - CLIMBING INTO THE COCKPIT - \nWhere the COPILOT (having climbed in from the other side,) sees it's not the right guy. As he fumbles for a weapon, BOND BASHES HIM WITH THE HELMET. The copilot collapses into his seat, unconscious. \nBond settles into his seat, fires the engines, closes the double canopy, and begins taxiing out. \nTHE CRUISE MISSILE - CROSSING OVER THE PERIMETER OF THE AIR BASE \nMI-6 SITUATION ROOM - ROEBUCK, TANNER, M, WATCHING, UNABLE TO BREATHE - \nHIGH ANGLE - THE RUNWAY - \nThe CRUISE SKIMS IN DIRECTLY OVER BOND'S PLANE, speeding to takeoff. \n(INT. BOND'S MiG) BOND SHOVES THE THROTTLES TO THE FIREBALL AND - \nTHE VIDEO-WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - \nKA-BOOM!!!! The scene on the screen erupts in a GIANT EXPLOSION - then turns to video-snow. Is Bond alive? No one in London knows. \nHIGH ANGLE - THE AIR BASE - \nThe FIREBALL grows and grows, a raging hell. And just when it seems no one could possibly survive: BOND'S MiG ROCKETS OUT OF THE FLAMES!! \nINT. BOND'S MiG - \nBond thinks he's safe. Sound. Until - \nMiG-2 FLIES OUT OF THE FIREBALL - \nCannons blazing at 007. A hail of metal and tracers. \nINT./EXT. BOND'S MIG - \nBond goes into evasive maneuvers - jinks right, jinks left - when, suddenly, THE COPILOT REVIVES, and starts trying to STRANGLE Bond with a METAL LANYARD. Struggling, Bond HEARS a THIN HIGH-PITCHED TONE - \nINT./EXT. MIG-2 \nThe pilot has locked onto Bond's MiG. Boom! TWO HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES roar away. \nINT./EXT. BOND'S MIG - \nFighting the garrote, Bond KICKS THE THROTTLES forward and PULLS BACK ON THE YOKE. The MiG goes into a spine crushing climb as - \nTHE TWO HEAT SEEKING MISSILES FOLLOW HIM, LOOPING UPWARD. \nINT. MIG-2 - \nBond's MiG has disappeared from the pilot's view: Not in front. Not on the left. Not on the right. Where did he go? The pilot looks up: \nEXT. MI-6 LONDON - DAY \nThe DB-5 drives past the guard. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nDebriefing: Bond, M, and several others listen as NATO COLONEL DOMINIQUE EVERHART, (early 30's, Belgian,) refers to video clips from the Khyber Pass sequence: \nCOL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART To sum up: After analyzing the tire inflation of the fork-lift in the MI-6 video tape, NATO believes the \"red box contains approximately eighty kilograms of U235 weapons grade uranium - an incredibly hard, incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal substance. \nM And that's enough enriched uranium to produce how many nuclear devices? \nCOL. DQMINIQUE EVERHART Depending on the builder's sophistication - one crude bomb that could devastate London, Paris, New York, Berlin - or all four if they have the latest technology. \nThere's a pregnant pause in the room. \nM And the participants? \nCOL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (pointing at the screen) Kim Dae Yung. Moscow-trained North Korean nuclear weapons specialist; apparently fell out of favor with the current North Korean regime after a botched attempt to steal fissionable material from a British light-water reactor in South Africa - an accident that left him entirely hairless... \nAnother face appears on the screen: \nCOL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (cont'd) And Rendera Sikrahm, also known as Richard Stamper. Freelance mercenary, Laos and Cambodia. His father was from Nepal - a Ghurka warrior - con- scripted by the British government to fight in China during World War II - after which the family settled in Hong Kong, where the young Stamper was undoubtedly treated like a second class citizen by both the Hong Kong Chinese, and local British. (beat, aside:) We've all read about the signs at the British swimming pools in Hong Kong that said \"No Ghurka's allowed.\" \nBOND Nothing like a little imperialism to promote loyalty among the faithful. \nCOL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (stifles a smile, then:) In conclusion: Both these men have a vendetta against the world. They are nuclear armed, and dangerous. And having failed to get the UZ35 through the old opium route - the Khyber Pass - it's NATO's belief that their next attempt will be through Bulgaria - where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force will be there to stop them. \nM Thank you Colonel Everhart. (stands, turns to:) 007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information? \nBOND Yes, M. \nM exits. Bond approaches Dominique. She smiles, warmly. There's a mutual attraction - but there's something else going on, unspoken. \nBOND Interesting presentation. \nDOMINIQUE Interesting video tape. \nBOND They point, I shoot. \nDOMINIQUE (feels her pockets) Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet. \nBOND Of course. \nBond hands her a PEN. She regards it cautiously. \nDOMINIQUE ... Does this do anything? \nBOND Depends what number you write. \nShe gives him a wry look; starts to write. He notes her WEDDING BAND. \nBOND Married? \nDOMINIQUE Happily. \nBOND ... Kids? \nDOMINIQUE Three. You? Married? \nBOND No. \nDOMINIQUE (smiles) I didn't think so. \nFor an instant, something crosses Bond's face: Bittersweetness? Re- morse? Either way, she's scored a subtle victory. \nDOMINIQUE Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me. \nBOND Thanks. (beat, holding her gaze) Take care - \nDOMINIQUE You too. \nWith a Sphinx-like smile, she watches Bond leave. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nWhere Bond encounters MONEYPENNY, also walking to M's office. \nBOND Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us. \nMONEYPENNY Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting? \nBOND In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera. \nMoneypenny cuts Bond a look - and, in the background, sees Dominique leave the conference room, and walk down the hall, away from them. \nMONEYPENNY By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea? \nBOND Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell? \nThey've come to a security door. She punches in a code - \nMONEYPENNY Actually, I've never known you to do either... But - \nBOND - We all want what we can't have? \nMONEYPENNY Not all of us, 007. \nThe door opens. They go into: \nINT. M'S ANTEROOM (MONEYPENNY'S AREA) - CONTINUOUS \nBOND What - no lust for adventure? \nMONEYPENNY No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want - (beat) Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy. \nBond scowls. Moneypenny smiles wryly, points to the inner door: \nMONEYPENNY Don't keep M waiting. \nINT. M'S OFFICE - DAY \nM is behind her desk; MINISTER PETER JOHNSTONE sits across - a high- handed Teflon-coated politician, with the survival instincts of plutonium. They've been arguing. \nM Come in, 007. You know the Minister? \nBOND Of course. (nods to) Minister Johnstone. \nMINISTER JOHNSTONE \nBond sits in an armchair. M presses a button, and a video/bio of ELIOT HARMSWAY appears on the wall behind her. Mid-50's, regal. \nM Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway? \nBOND (quipping) Only what I read in the newspapers. \nMINISTER JOHNSTONE (disdainfully) His newspapers? \nBOND (glancing sideways) Occasionally, yes. (directly to M) British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks. \nM (holding up a copy of:) - Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. - \nBOND (examining them curiously) Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem? \nSAUNDERS (frowns) Moving along - (he produces:) A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here - (pointing to) And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in. \nBOND Does it work on cash machines? \nSaunders is suddenly stricken. Flustered. He blurts out: \nSAUNDERS It was an authorized test. I returned the money. \nBOND (amused) I see... \nSAUNDERS (ignoring this) Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter. \nBOND (needling him) If you can't do the time, don't do the crime? \nSAUNDERS (smirks at Bond, pauses, then) Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device. \nHe hands Bond a WEDDING BAND. \nBOND A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this? \nSAUNDERS I believe Q's exact words were: (imitating Q, emphatically:) \"Hopefully, nothing.\" \nBond turns from Saunder's devious grin to an amused M. Smiles: \nBOND ...I'll give you a ring from Venice. \nM Good luck on your mission, 007. \nHe snaps the ring down on her desk. \nBOND Till death do us part. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VENICE HARBOR/GRAND CANAL - NIGHT \nA GLEAMING WHITE YACHT - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge tarped hold - dominates the harbor. (Harmsway's SEA DOLPHIN II.) \nTonight, however, we find a GONDOLA, gliding through the water... \nArriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed partygoers and musicians in medieval garb. \nWearing the mask from M's office, (and a bright blue cape,) Bond alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd. \nEXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - NIGHT \nA swirl of colors, noise and music. Pushing his way into the chaotic celebration, Bond scans the crowd, looking for a face: \nNOTHING BUT A SEA OF MASKS. White. Yellow. Red. Blue. \nCaught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right, anxiously looking for the contact. Who is it? \nTHREE MASKED WOMEN appear in front of Bond. They curtsy, and giggle. \nWOMAN Buona sera, signore - \nHe's spun by a MASKED MAN with a bottle. \nMAN Vino? \nBond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a group of celebrants carrying a long banner. \nSuddenly, the CROWD SURGES FORWARD: A PROCESSION, carrying the EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL is making its way through the square. \nLocked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, Bond struggles to look forward - left, right - when he FEELS A TUG at his cape from behind. He can only crane his neck to see/hear - \nMASKED WOMAN I may have been followed. Meet me at the Church in five minutes! \nWith an effort, Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks behind him. \nSAN GIACOMO SQUARE - NIGHT \nFive minutes later. Almost deserted. A few stray couples. The MASKED WOMAN appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and the moonlight, looking for Bond. Suddenly - \nWhomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove. \nBOND Looking for someone? \nRecovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - PARIS removes her mask. She shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007: \nPARIS Hello, James. \nBond reacts. He is not happy to see her. \nBOND Paris?!? What are you doing here? \nPARIS Is that any way to say hello? \nBOND I thought your specialty was good-bye. \nParis smiles coyly. She LIFTS A HAND to tousle his hair - \nPARIS Oh, James. I've missed you - \nBOND (grabbing her by the wrist) Is this another one of your games? \nPARIS Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice? \nBOND I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense. \nShe's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness. \nPARIS Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you? \nBOND Nothing. \nShe turns away from him, fighting back tears. Bond doesn't care: \nBOND What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts? \nPARIS (anguished) No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans - (facing Bond, becoming hysterical:) You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love - \nBOND SLAPS HER. She's stunned. He waits. She's angered: \nPARIS Do you feel better now? \nBOND (not giving an inch) Do you? \nShe turns away. Bond feels remorse for hitting her. Softens: \nBOND What about the uranium? \nPARIS It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow. \nBond reaches out to touch her. She falls into his arms, burying her face in his shoulder. \nPARIS I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again. \nBOND (patting her head) Shhhhh... \nTHUG #2 Marco - I didn't know - \nTHUG #1 After him! \nThey charge off. \nIL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT \nBond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard. \nTHE SPIRAL STAIRS - \nBond takes the marble steps, two at a time. \nRETURN ON THE COURTYARD - \nThe two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him. \nTHE BALCONY - \nComing off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs. \nBond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape. \nPocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and disappears from sight... \nJust as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase. \nFIRST ROOFTOP - \nBond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop to an adjoining building. Bond jumps. \nSECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP - \n007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down: The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof. \nAs Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof - \nRETURN ON THE BALCONY - \nThug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below. \nFIRST ROOFTOP - \nThug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the next building. He makes a running leap. \nSECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP - \nBond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond. \nAT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment. \n007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1 tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO BOND'S LEGS. \nThey sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the two of them fall - \nCRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: - \nVENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT. \nThey land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the collar, hauling him up on his feet. \nThug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond: \nTHUG #1 I owe you some pain. \nWith lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING. \nThe flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA, and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away. \nAs BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally (yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR. \nWith a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room. He's having fun. \nAS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER - \nTHUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond. \nBOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out of the way, like a gnat. \nConcerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug. \nUnimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE, and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed \"King Arthur\" type sword. \nWith one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO. The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to: \nA DISPLAY WALL - \nfilled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD. (Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks. Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax. \nTHE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax. \nNEW ANGLE - \nGripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN. (Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.) \nThug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden. \nAs Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club) \nBond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN TWO... But loses the weapon in the process. \nNow, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  - \nIn a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1 backwards, down onto the floor. \nAND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX - \nTHUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR. \nBOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE: \nTHUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM. \nAnd at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and - \nNEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV - \nThe iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor. \nRETURN TO SCENE - \nThe Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still clutching Bond's gun. Bond bends down and retrieves it. \nBOND He fought hard... (holstering the gun) But the case was terminal. \nAnd on this note, we - \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. VENICE HARBOR - THE NEXT DAY - \nAt microwave. His finger hovers over button, then stops. He opens the door of the microwave and takes out a bowl. Dumps the contents on the stove. \nINT. SHIP'S HEAD - \nCREW MEMBER with an ELECTRIC SHAVER. \nFIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM) All personal radios, video devices and computers will be stowed at once. \nHe stops shaving. \nINT. ENGINE ROOM - \nThe ENGINEER shouts to his crew, over NOISE OF DIESEL ENGINES: \nENGINEER Check the engine baffles; rig the generators for shielded operation. \nRETURN ON THE BRIDGE - \nThe First Officer stands next to the Communications Officer. \nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER Communications set to receive only, sir. \nThe First Officer looks over the shoulder of RATING at radar screen. \nRATING Radar switched to passive mode; sonar re-set to low-power operation. (beat) You couldn't find our signature with a magnifying glass. \nFIRST OFFICER Let's hope so. \nThe First Officer joins the Second Officer at the windows, scanning the horizon with binoculars. \nSECOND OFFICER Looks like we're in for a long, uncomfortable trip. \nFIRST OFFICER We'll all breathe a lot easier when we get this cargo back to London. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANOR HOUSE - THE COAST OF SCOTLAND - DAY \nTHE BAGPIPE AND DRUM CORPS of the Royal Highland Regiment (aka the \"Black Watch\") is playing a FUNERAL DIRGE outside a vast stone house, with a HARMSWAY NEWS HELICOPTER on the lawn, and LIMOUSINES, A HEARSE and a FLOWER CAR in the driveway. \nSIX MEN IN FORMAL MOURNING ATTIRE are entering the house. \nINT. GRAND ROOM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE - \nA SINGLE WHITE ROSE is added to a pile of white roses in PARIS HARMSWAY'S OPEN CASKET. \nREVEAL: We're in mid-procession: The last two (of the six men from outside) place roses in the casket... \nThen turn, nodding sorrowfully to ELLIOT HARMSWAY (sitting in the front row of a room that's keen turned into a makeshift chapel)... \nAnd follow hand signals of STAMPER, who motions them THROUGH A DOOR, to an unseen room. \nAfter the last man has paid his respects, HARMSWAY stands, walks to the bier, and - wiping away a tear - places a single RED ROSE in his dead wife's casket. \nINT. HARMSWAY'S INNER SANCTUM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE - DAY \nWe're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a James Bond movie: Slick, stark, sterile. Steel, glass, chrome. \nThe SIX men are seated around a giant conference table, looking absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire. \nElliot Harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the Liechtenstein that hangs in the lobby of CAA,) walks to the head of the table, takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and: \nHARMSWAY Good morning, Gentlemen. I'm sorry to bring you here under these circumstances, but (beat) Considering our meeting was already scheduled, this was a happy coincidence. \nThe men nod. Harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel. \nHARMSWAY (cont'd) Number One, your report? \nA gap-toothed Californian with bland features stands. \nNUMBER ONE Sir Elliot: The entertainment division is releasing three new animated children's movies this year. (pause) By the time we're finished promoting them on our TV, radio, cable, newspaper, and magazine outlets - (pause) There won't be a parent in the universe who won't feel guilty if they don't take their children to our stores and theme parks to buy the toys, books, video- games and clothing featuring our 'lovable little creatures.' (pause) We anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion dollars. \nHARMSWAY Excellent, Number One. Build a better rat-trap, and the world truly will beat a path to your theme park. (turns to) Number Two? \nA young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like Bill Gates. \nNUMBER TWO As you're aware, Sir Elliot, our software division has introduced a new computer operating system, Gates '99. (beat) It's deliberately filled with bugs - so people will be forced to buy our upgrades over the next five years. (beat) The window on revenues is 2.8 billion. \nHARMSWAY Outstanding, Number Two. (beat, remembering:) By the way - Number Five - ? (a man looks up) Who's ahead in the American elections? \nNUMBER FIVE The Democrat, sir. By nine points. \nHARMSWAY Maybe it's time to publish that story about his sex life. Even things up. A close race is always better for our TV ratings. \nNUMBER FIVE Consider him slimed, sir. \nHARMSWAY Splendid. Next... (with noticeable reserve) Number Three. Your report? \nA SHORT MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN stands. Nervous. \nNUMBER THREE I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War. \nHARMSWAY ...Haven't we already paid him for his services? \nNUMBER THREE Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment. \nA pause. The other men in the room shift uncomfortably. \nHARMSWAY ... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account? \nNUMBER THREE No sir! I swear! This is not true!! \nHARMSWAY You disappoint me, Number Three. \nHarmsway presses a button. Stamper enters. Number Three assumes this means death. He BEGS FOR HIS LIFE: \nNUMBER THREE Please sir. Please - \nHARMSWAY ...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves. \nNumber Three is confused. Does this mean he's going to live? \nHARMSWAY Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane. \nNUMBER THREE (overwhelmed with gratitude) Thank you sir! Thank you! \nHarmsway nods, watching him leave: \nHARMSWAY Good-bye, Mr. Azziz. \nAnd the man is gone. Harmsway turns his attention back to the room: \nHARMSWAY Let's proceed with new business. \nHarmsway presses another button. The room darkens. The CENTER OF THE TABLE OPENS, and a 3-D MAP OF MALAYSIA rises into view. \nHARMSWAY Gentlemen: In exactly 36 hours, we are going to initiate phase one of the word's most perfect crime: The biggest theft in the history of mankind. (beat, pointing with a laser) Right here. In the Strait of Malacca. \nEXT. LIMOUSINE - MANOR HOUSE - DAY \nStamper holds the back door open for Number Three. He gets in. \nFIRST OFFICER A dead head. (off the others' quizzical looks) Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west. (calling out) Muncy! Engines to half! \nHELMSMAN Aye-aye sir. Engines to half. \nFIRST OFFICER (explaining) Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nThe ship is moving towards a DARK VERTICAL SHAPE - Harmsway's SEA-BED CORE BORING DRILL (shorthand \"THE WORM',) attached to a long flexible dredging pipe. \nCLOSER - THE HEAD OF THE WORM - \nMotionless, hanging in the water. Then the monster awakes: A metal sphere retracts, revealing a wide angle CAMERA LENS. \nINT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe Communications Officer reacts to his monitor with ALARM: \nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER I'm getting an electrical emission, sir! Extremely close. Bearing 240 - \nThe First Officer is surprised. All hell is about to break loose:       - \nFIRST OFFICER Punch up the radar - \nRADAR OPERATOR I've got it, sir. A large craft - XX,OOO tons. Range - (disbelief) 200 yards? It's anchored in a cove! \nFIRST OFFICER That's impossible! We're in the middle of the channel! \nA Junior officer bursts in from the exterior bridge: \nJUNIOR OFFICER Breakers off the port bow! We're heading for shore! \nSONAR OFFICER Sir - \nFIRST OFFICER (reacting to the Jr. Officer) Full stop!!! Call the captain! \nSONAR OFFICER Sir! \nFIRST OFFICER (annoyed) What?!?! \nSONAR OPERATOR The log is moving! \nEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nPropelled by water-jets in its head, THE WORM STREAKS TOWARD THE INDOMITABLE, emitting a HIGH PITCHED whine as its drill bit revs up to speed. The drill's BLACK TEETH glisten in the water. \nTHE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, NIGHT) \nClosing in on the hull like a torpedo. It gets closer, picking up speed, until - on IMPACT - \nINT. ENGINE ROOM - \nA TORRENT OF WATER engulfs the Engineer and Crewmen when The Worm bursts/drills through the hull. As they scream, drowning - \nA CREWMAN ON THE GANTRY scrambles up, one step ahead of the water, through a bulkhead, into - \nGENERATOR ROOM - (CONTINUOUS) \nWhere the CREWMAN and TWO OPERATORS struggle to CLOSE THE DOOR AGAINST THE WATER. \nSENIOR OPERATOR (on the intercom) We've been hit! We're taking water! \nTHE BRIDGE - \nAlarms sound! Red lights flash! \nDAMAGE CONTROL Flooding in the engine room! \nFIRST OFFICER Get me damage reports! Start the pumps! \nSECOND OFFICER (holding out a ship's phone) \nIt's the Captain - \nPASSAGEWAY #1 - \nOn a phone, outside the ship's GYM, deep in the hull: \nTHE CAPTAIN What the hell is going on?!? \nFIRST OFFICER (intercut if necessary) I think we've been holed, sir! \nTHE CAPTAIN On my way! \nHe speeds along the passageway, going through a water-tight door, slamming it behind him. Meanwhile, on - \nTHE BRIDGE - \nHELMSMAN The engines are gone! \nDAMAGE CONTROL Flooding on D deck! \nFIRST OFFICER Sound the general alarm! Seal all compartments! \nAs the Second Officer grabs the intercom - \nSECOND OFFICER (into intercom) Attention all hands - \nCREW'S MESS - \nThe crew members look up from their meals - \nSECOND OFFICER (continuing) Proceed to emergency stations - \nGENERATOR ROOM - \nThe men have closed the door, but... HEAR A HIGH-PITCHED WHINING, GRINDING SOUND from the other side. They exchange a quizzical look; they don't know what to make of it, when: \nBANG! The door explodes inward - and a high-pressured stream of water blasts in, blowing them back against the walls. \nBRIDGE - \nThe lights go out! Everyone is scrambling: \nSYSTEMS OFFICER We've lost power! \nFIRST OFFICER Go to back up generators! \nSECOND OFFICER (into intercom) Repeat: Seal all compartments, and - \nCREW'S MESS - \nIn the dim lighting - \nSECOND OFFICER (on intercom) Proceed to emergency stations at once! \nThe men start to move, but halt at A HUMMING SOUND. They look around: Where is it coming from? \nSuddenly a THREE FOOT SECTION OF THE DECK EXPLODES IN A FOUNTAIN OF WATER. The men are swept off their feet. \nPASSAGEWAY/GANTRY #2 - \nOne of the CREWMAN SPOTS SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE: \nCREWMAN Hey - look! Over there! \nNEW ANGLE - (ROCK OUTCROPPING - STRAIT OF MALACCA - NIGHT) \nThe SEA DOLPHIN II emerges from a cove, looking like a ghostly white apparition in the fog. \nRETURN ON THE LIFEBOAT - \nThe men yell and wave and whistle, hoping to be saved. \nCLOSER ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - DECK - \nElliot Harmsway removes a pair of binoculars from his face. Turns to YUNG, standing next to him at the rail: \nHARMSWAY Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn't it? \nYung looks at Harmsway like he's crazy. Oblivious, Harmsway looks at his WATCH, then looks through the BINOCULARS again - and begins to WHISTLE the opening notes of My Fair Lady's \"WOULDN'T IT BE LOVERLY.\" (\"All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air\") \nTHE LIFEBOAT - \nAs the men cry for help, the Sonar Operator spots something just below the surface, moving toward the lifeboat at great speed. \nHe hears the hum. His eyes follow the churning water... \nAnd suddenly - out of nowhere - the Worm hits the lifeboat from below, smashing it to bits, hurtling the pieces in the air. \nTHE SEA DOLPHIN II - \nHarmsway lowers the binoculars' smiling. Stamper appears, hands Harmsway a piece of paper. \nSTAMPER We've decoded their last transmission. \nHarmsway studies it for a moment - smiles. \nHARMSWAY Perfect. They'll be searching miles from here. (then) Time for phase two. You can get the men in the water. \nAnd with this, Harmsway turns, and walks off, jauntily whistling \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly.\" \nStamper looks at Yung, re: Harmsway's glee. \nYUNG You heard him. Get the men in the water! \nNEW ANGLE - SIDE OF THE SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT - \nIn the water next to the chip, FOUR DIVERS drop the last of their equipment in a DIVE BOAT. They cast off, motoring into the fog. \nEXT. LONDON - RESTAURANT BIBENDUM - NIGHT \nThe classic Michelin building on Fulham road. \nINT. RESTAURANT BIBENDUM - \nA YOUNG WOMAN is yammering away at Bond; he's trying to put a good face on what is obviously a dreadful fix-up first date. \nWOMAN I can't believe it took us so long to finally get together! What exactly do you do for the government? \nBOND (after a beat) You might say... 'Public relations.' \nWOMAN How fascinating! I bet you meet all the most fabulous people. \nBefore Bond can answer, the MAITRE D' interrupts. \nMAITRE D' Excuse me - Mr. Bond? You have a call. \nBond excuses himself. \nNEW ANGLE - BOND AT PHONE - \n007 picks up the receiver, without saying hello: \nBOND Moneypenny! You're early. You weren't supposed to call until - (he stiffens) Yes. I understand. Twenty minutes. \nEXT. THE BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT \nPassing a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY TRUCK with an ad for \"TOMORROW\" (\"The Paper that Never Lies,\") Bond's DB-5 roars past the guard. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT \nADMIRAL ROEBUCK glares as MINISTER JOHNSTONE enters to address M, TANNER, A TREASURY OFFICIAL, and various UNIFORMS and SUITS. \nMINISTER JOHNSTONE Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour. (beat) For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago - \nADMIRAL ROEBUCK (interrupting) Excuse me, but - (all turn to him:) I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6. (beat, as M and Tanner exchange a look) This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy. \nMINISTER JOHNSTONE (furious) Admiral, are you suggesting - \nHe's distracted by the CLICK OF A DOOR OPENING. All turn to SEE BOND entering, wearing a FULL NAVAL UNIFORM. M stifles a smile. \nBOND Sorry I'm late - \nM Actually, you're just in time. (she turns to) Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you? \nADMIRAL ROEBUCK (deflated) Yes. Of course. \nBOND I've looked forward to meeting you. \nBond sits. M glances at Johnstone as if to say \"proceed.\" \nMINISTER JOHNSTONE As I was saying: Approximately forty- five minutes ago, we received an abandon ship signal from the H.M.S. Indomitable. (flicks on a map display) Looking at these infrared satellite images - provided by Mr. Tanner of MI-6 -the ship is presumed lost here, just south of Kuala Lumpur, where she broadcast her last position. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STRAIT OF MALACCA - FOG - NIGHT \nForeground, empty diving boat. Background, Sea Dolphin II, with the \"flexible hose\" hanging over the rail, down into the water. \nINT. BRIDGE - SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT \nStamper works \"worm\" master control with a video joystick. \nSTAMPER Divers approaching the hull. \nHarmsway and Yung look over his shoulder at: \nINSERT - VIDEO SCREEN - \nThrough the worm's UNDERWATER camera, FOUR DIVERS with TORCHES and WELDING TOOLS are about to enter the HOLE in the Indomitable's hull. \n(The video screen also contains lots of digital information about the divers and the worm's functions.) \nNEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - EXT. INDOMITABLE \nThe worm follows the Divers into the hull. \nWORM POV - INT. ENGINE ROOM - \nIt trails the Divers past debris and bodies of crewman. \nSAME SHOT - VIDEO SCREEN - WORM POV - \nEXT. BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS - \nM I've already contacted our station in Kuala Lumpur. They're lining up a local contact. (beat) I want you to find that gold, and secure it. \nThey've arrived at her car. The door is already open. \nBOND ... Didn't Elliot Harmsway just move his headquarters to Kuala Lumpur? \nShe turns, freezes Bond with a look: \nM Contrary to what you may believe, 007, the world is not filled with mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes, stock them with big-breasted women, and threaten the world with nuclear annihilation. \nBond reacts to the comeuppance. She continues: \nM (cont'd) The case is closed. The Italian authorities ruled the girl a suicide. We had enough trouble keeping your name out of the media. For everyone's sake - (beat) Your job is to find the gold. Not settle some personal score with Elliot Harmsway. \nEXT. 'HARMSWAY BUILDING' (HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK) - HONG KONG - DUSK \nSuper: HONG KONG. Harmsway's helicopter is perched atop the famous tinker-toy-styled building in the Central district. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BOARDROOM - DUSK \nA CHINESE CHOP comes down firmly on a legal document. GENERAL LI (of the People's Revolutionary Army) is seated with a squad of lawyers: \nGENERAL LI And that is the fifth document. With your counter-signature, the sale will be complete. \nThe document is passed across to HARMSWAY, sitting with his own legal counsel. One of the men is WHISPERING TO HIM, INTENSELY: \nYOUNG CHINESE LAWYER Are you sure? If we waited - \nHarmsway waves the lawyer off, silencing him. Addresses the General: \nHARMSWAY General Li: My young associate here has just informed me that if I waited a year, I could perhaps receive a higher price for this building. (beat, wryly) He has great faith in Hong Kong. As did my ancestors. With obvious results. \nNervous chuckles around the table, but the General is reserved. \nHARMSWAY (cont'd) Yet to sell this building for more money - to profiteer - would run counter to the Chinese sprit of guanchi - mutual trust and obligation; it would violate the ancient principles of feng shui - (beat) - the reason we sign five documents instead of an unlucky four, and why this building has a fifth, non-functioning ventilation shaft on its roof. (beat) Wind and water, fire and rain, earth and sky - feng shui. All things - at one, in balance, with nature. \nGENERAL LI ...Most eloquently put, Sir Elliot. \nHARMSWAY Thank you, General Li. Now I'll just sign this last document - \nHe puts the pen to the paper, and BREAKS THE PEN. Alarmed looks. \nHARMSWAY (cont'd) Terribly sorry. Mr. Stamper? \nFrom behind, Stamper hands him a pen. Harmsway innocently starts to sign in RED INK - \nGENERAL LI Sir Elliot! Red ink - \nHARMSWAY Of course! How foolish. More bad luck. I'll just borrow yours - \nHe takes General Li's pen, and signs his name with a flourish. \nEXT. ROOF OF 'HARMSWAY BUILDING' - \nUnder the whirring blades of the chopper, Harmsway bids farewell to General Li. He and Stamper get in helicopter. \nCLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER - \nAs Harmsway waves good-bye from the window, the helicopter rises, REVEALING a METAL CABLE attached to the LANDING SKID. \nWIDER - \nThe cable leads to a spool, which runs to the FIFTH METAL VENTILATION SHAFT Harmsway referred to in the last scene. \nINT. HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE - \nHarmsway pops open a bottle of champagne. \nHARMSWAY An old Chinese toast to our friends... \nRETURN ON ROOFTOP HELIPAD - \nThe General SEES THE CABLE GROW TAUT AROUND THE VENTILATION SHAFT. He reacts with horror. \nINT. HELICOPTER/HARMSWAY ROOFTOP POV - \nHarmsway glances down to watch the VENTILATION SHAFT TOPPLE onto the General and his aides, scattering them like rats. \nIn the chopper, the pilot cuts the cable, and Harmsway lifts a champagne glass: \nHARMSWAY Confusion to the enemy. In 48 hours, that building - and all of Hong Kong around it - will cease to exist. \nAERIAL - SKIES ABOVE STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY - \nA BRITISH MILITARY C-130 airship is dropping sono-buoys into the water from a low altitude. me plane veers off, revealing A BRITISH SEA KING command and control helicopter, hovering above. \nINT. SEA KING HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE - DAY \nBond holds a map of the channel. He's standing over several CREWMAN seated at radar, sonar, and navigation consoles. \nCREWMAN 1 Sounding: Bottom is thirty fathoms. \nCREWMAN 2 Nothing. Negative bounce. \nBOND We should be right over it. \nThey hear a SHARP DINGING SOUND - \nOPERATOR 2 Wait - I'm getting something. \nBOND Where? What is it? \nThe man points at one of the screens, where Bond sees a COMPUTER GENERATED MAP OF THE SEA FLOOR, with the FAINT OUTLINE of a WARSHIP. \nOPERATOR 2 Not sure yet - \nHe types in some commands on a keyboard, and a 3-D rendering of a boat appears on another computer screen. Lots of data: \nOPERATOR 2 The Shinjuku. Japanese troop carrier. World War II. \nBOND Let's make another pass. \nCO-PILOT (calling out) We have traffic on the deck - \nThey look down and see an HNN (Harmsway News Network) boat. \nBOND Get rid of them. \nNEW ANGLE - EXT. SEA RING CHOPPER & HNN BOAT - \nThe chopper hovers above the HNN boat - \nPILOT (on pa speaker) Please leave the area. please leave the area. \nEXT. HNN WORLD HEADQUARTERS (PETRONAS TOWERS)- KUALA LUMPUR - DAY \nWe're looking up at the world's tallest building: The 1500' twin Petronas Towers. (They look like an architectural collaboration between Friz Lang and H.G. Wells.) At the 50th floor, there's a sky bridge connecting the buildings, where - \nINT. SKY BRIDGE - (HNN HEADQUARTERS) - DAY \nEXT. PORT KLANG - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nThe Harbor Master's tower overlooks a small armada of yachts, fishing boats, etc. A series of long dockways jut out into the harbor. \nCIGARETTE BOAT - (PORT KLANG - WATERWAY) - DAY \nWade's boat is moving slowly along the waterway at the end of the docks. Looking off, Bond spots the Harbor Master's Tower: \nBOND Over there. \nWade turns the boat down one of the dock channels. \nNEW ANGLE - WADE/BOND'S POV - DOCKWAY CHANNEL - \nA SLEEK LAUNCH is ROARING TOWARDS them, on a dead collision course. A WOMAN in a baseball cap is at the wheel. \nWADE pulls his boat to the right; the LAUNCH ROARS AROUND THEM, rocking the cigarette boat with its wake. \nBOTH BOND and WADE clock the woman - who we will later learn is SIDNEY WINCH. Wade stares after her: \nWADE I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife. \nBOND (seeing they're about to crash) Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy. \nWade scowls, setting the boat back on course. \nDOCKSIDE - PORT KLANG - DAY - \nBond hops off the boat, securing the lines. Wade joins him. \nWADE By the way, Jimbo - whatever happened to that girl - in Cuba - ? \nFinished tying the boat, they walk toward the Harbor Master's office. \nBOND Natalya? \nWADE Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation. \nBOND She married a hockey player. \nWADE I envy your 'undercover' assignments. \nBOND (a look, then) We work in the dark. We do what we can. \nINT. HARBOR MASTER OFFICE - PORT KLANG - DAY \nThe local Malay harbor master puts a stack of charts on the counter. \nHARBOR MASTER Wind, tide, currents... You're the second person today asked for a full set of charts. (holds out a clipboard) If you'd just sign here - \nBond takes the clipboard - \nINSERT CLIPBOARD - read signature: SIDNEY WINCH. \nBond returns the clipboard: \nBOND Thanks. (apparent afterthought) By the way - was there anything strange the night before last? Odd weather, lost boats - ?? \nHARBOR MASTER No... Unless you're talking about the bus problem. \nBOND ...Bus problem? \nHARBOR MASTER Captain Cheong's ferry was late. He runs the line across the Strait between here and Sumatra. The lumber mill workers coming back for the weekend missed the last bus. Slept on the docks. Hundreds of them. \nBOND Thanks. \nEXT. HARBOR MASTER'S TOWER - DAY \nBond emerges, carrying the charts, along with Wade. \nBOND I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong? \nWADE Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club. \nBOND Can you arrange a meeting? \nWADE Hell. The CIA built that club. \nEXT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT \nPalm trees, torch lights, and Rolls Royces. \nINT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT \nA local band plays on the verandah. We find Wade at a POKER TABLE with five local Malay Chinese. He CUTS THE CARDS, exuberantly: \nWADE Okay gentlemen. The name of the game is 7-card Cambodian stud. Everything is wild! \nAnd then - moving through a beaded glass curtain - we find Bond, in a white dinner jacket, sitting with CAPTAIN CHEONG. The Captain is elegant, mid-5O's, eye patch. (To be put into local dialect.) \nCAPTAIN CHEONG In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond. \nBOND I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships. \nCAPTAIN CHEONG Sometimes kill the crew; other times - (points to his eye) Torture them. \nBOND I'm sorry. \nCAPTAIN CHEONG The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem. \nBOND Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver? \nCAPTAIN CHEONG Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong. (chuckles) My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.' \nBOND (smiles, standing to leave) I appreciate your time - \nCAPTAIN CHEONG Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait. \nBOND Where can I find him? \nCAPTAIN CHEONG Him? He, is a she - (points) at the bar. \nNEW ANGLE - THE BAR - \nSIDNEY WINCH, about 32, tough, smart, and (here's a surprise,) beautiful, is ordering a drink when Bond appears: \nSIDNEY Bourbon. Neat. \nBOND I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat. \nVery slowly, Sidney turns to Bond. She looks him up and down - as if deciding whether this specimen is worth her time. Her conclusion: A definite - though skeptical - maybe. She gives him a sultry smile: \nSIDNEY Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless. \nBOND - And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake. \nSIDNEY (thinking, 'not bad') Have we met? \nBOND This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. (holds out his hand to shake) James Bond. \nSIDNEY Sidney Winch. \nAnd we're back at the outcropping where the Indomitable sank. The SPORT FISHING BOAT is trolling against a background of sandy beaches and the lush green hills of Sumatra. \nFLYING BRIDGE - \nWade scans the shore; Bond studies the sonar display. \nWADE I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course? \nBOND (concentrating on the sonar) Who knows? Fog, night... \nWADE They'd never sail this close to the shore. \nBOND Wait a minute - (beat, pointing to the screen) I've got it. There! Off the port bow! \nINSERT SONAR SCREEN - \nThe murky electronic outline of a ship. \nBACK TO SCENE - \nBond watches the sonar screen. Wade slows engines, consults charts. \nBOND Cut the engines! It's about two- hundred fifty feet down. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nAN ANCHOR BEING PITCHED INTO THE WATER - (BOW OF SPORT FISHING BOAT) - \nBy Wade. Bond is strapping on his scuba tank. \nWADE Two-fifty's pretty deep for air. You should really be using mixed gases. \nBond glances at the air gauge on his tanks. \nBOND I'll make a bounce dive. If I can keep my bottom time short, I'll be all right. \nBond gathers up FLARES, and sits on the gunwale. \nBOND (only half teasing) Keep your eye out for pirates. \nWade pulls back his shirt to reveal TWO SIX-SHOOTERS. \nWADE I got you covered. \nBOND That's reassuring. \nBond rolls backward into the water and disappears. \nUNDERWATER - \nBond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward, handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom. \nUNDERWATER BOTTOM - \nBond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom. Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel. \nEXT. INDOMITABLE - UNDERWATER - \nAhead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand. \nBond lights a FLARE, and the scene is suddenly alive with color. From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being lost beyond range of his flare. Bond checks his air gauge. \nINSERT GAUGES - \nDepth: 283 feet - Air capacity: 3/4 tank remaining. \nBACK TO SCENE - \nBond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable. He pauses to study the damage. Then enters. \nINT. ENGINE ROOM - UNDERWATER - \nBond sees the damage on the passageway door. Swims through it. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - UNDER WATER - \nThe flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor; Bond swims to the busted bilge-hold hatch. Again, he pauses to examine the marks made by the worm. He drops into the hold. \nINT. CARGO HOLD - UNDER WATER - \nThe gold is gone. Bond swims a few yards in: Nothing. A vast empty space. Bond's flare sputters and dies. He drops it, lights another. \nAs he turns to exit, SOMETHING GLINTS on the deck below the hatch. He moves toward it. \nNEW ANGLE - CLOSER - \nA half-chewed GOLD BAR is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead. Bond reaches for it, feeling the worm's drill marks on the gold. \nJust as he yanks the bar out, a MORAY EEL lashes out from behind the brace, baring its teeth. \nStill clutching the gold bar, Bond jumps back, and shoots up, into: \nPASSAGE WAY -(INT. INDOMITABLE) - UNDER WATER - \nwhere he collides with something floating just below the ceiling. Dropping the flare on the impact, Bond twists around to see: \nTHE FACE OF A FLOATING DEAD SAILOR. \nBACK TO SCENE - \nThrowing wildly gyrating shadows, the flare drops to the deck, roll- ing under some debris. Regaining his composure, Bond SLIPS THE GOLD BAR INTO A WEBBED SACK ON HIS BELT, then moves to retrieve the flare. \nCLOSE ON HATCH/DECK - \nBond reaches for the flare, under a section of the torn hatch cover. He notices the BROKEN URANIUM GRINDING TOOTH. He picks it up, stuffs it into his sack, and swims off. \nCUT TO: \nUNDERWATER BOTTOM - ANCHOR - \nBond swims to the anchor line, grabs hold, and starts up. On the way, he glances at his gauges: \nINSERT GAUGES - \nDepth: 160 feet - Air capacity: below RED LINE - empty. The ambient light level on the gauges suddenly DARKENS. \nBOND LOOKS UP TO THE SURFACE - \nHIS POV - \nA black HULL has blotted out the light... And SOMETHING LARGE AND HEAVY IS FALLING straight at 007. \nBOND - \nkicks away from the anchor-line just as a 1000 POUND ANCHOR streaks by. He looks up again: \nTHREE DIVERS ARE IN THE WATER. \nOne carries a strange-looking HARPOON-TYPE GUN; another trails a CABLE. The divers have fanned out, looking for 007. \nBOND - \nINT. ELEVATOR - \nThe doors close. Bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling. Harmsway is about to take great delight in making Bond squirm: \nHARMSWAY Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men... (beat) Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her. \nBOND I see. \nHARMSWAY I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur. \nBOND I wonder if it runs in the family. \nHARMSWAY (bursts out in a laugh) The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success. \nHe looks up at the digital readout, going from 40 to 50. \nHARMSWAY Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this. \nBOND I can feel your pain. \nThe doors open: \nHARMSWAY By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond? \nBOND Sightseeing. \nHarmsway motions for Bond to exit. They step out into: \nINT. ELEGANT HALLWAY (\"ROGUES GALLERY\") - LATE AFTERNOON \nA short hallway lined with OIL PORTRAITS of Harmsway's ancestors. Double doors at both ends. (People passing through.) As they walk - \nHARMSWAY I call this the Rogue's gallery. \nBOND Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives. \nHARMSWAY (pointing to the first portrait) My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese. (moving to) His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai... (moving to) His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper. (pausing, wistfully) It was a city of unlimited possibility. \nBOND So why did you leave? \nHARMSWAY Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow? (moving to the last two portraits) In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but... (passing his own portrait) I turned it into this \nHe pushes through a door, into: \nINT. HNN NEWS CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON - \nA cavernous THREE STORY ROOM bristling with activity. At the center is the main HNN ANCHOR DESK, (where a news broadcast is in progress,) surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la CNN. \nAround the perimeter of the room are VARIOUS TV STUDIOS looking out on Kuala Lumpur. All are broadcasting: A Larry King-type chat show; MTV; SPORTS; a KITCHEN where a chef is preparing something flambeed. \nWith its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect is overwhelming. Harmsway will walk Bond around the perimeter: \nHARMSWAY Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond. (starting to walk) Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions: (pointing) News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers: (a wave of his hand) 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages. \nBOND And still not a thing to watch. \nHe glances at the SATELLITE CONTROL ROOM, with a NASA-type WORLD MAP. \nBOND ...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites. \nHARMSWAY They're merely tools to disseminate information. \nBOND (wryly) Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute? \nHARMSWAY (guffaws) Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but - (off Bond's reaction) You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you. \nHe stops at a VIDEO TERMINAL. Begins to type. \nHARMSWAY Let's see... First we have this James Bond... I believe he's a field adjuster for Lloyd's of London... \nINSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S MI-6 COVER - \nHARMSWAY Then we have this James Bond. \nINSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S KGB FILE - \nHARMSWAY (reading from the screen) ... Licensed to Kill... (aside) Not a bad title for that book... (then) Or perhaps you'd prefer this James Bond - \nINSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S CHINESE FILE - \nHARMSWAY Who I believe they call \"007.\" \nBond is not amused. Harmsway is enjoying himself: \nHARMSWAY You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK. \nBOND ...Words to live by? \nHARMSWAY Your choice. (glancing at his watch) Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing. \nAs they leave, Bond is frustrated by Harmsway's \"I don't care what you think you know - I can crush you\" attitude... And now, Harmsway plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use Bond, to tie off the one other loose thread in his perfect crime: \nINT. HARMSWAY'S OFFICE - \nThe DOOR opens and Harmsway enters, followed by Bond. He calls to someone we don't see: \nHARMSWAY Hello, dear. I'm sorry I took so long - \nREVEAL: SIDNEY is sitting across from his desk. \nSIDNEY That's okay, Uncle Ell - \nShe freezes in mid-sentence, seeing Bond. Bond is equally surprised. \nSIDNEY What is HE doing here? \nHARMSWAY I see you two have met. \nBOND Briefly. \nHARMSWAY (crossing to his desk) Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.' (sly glance to Bond) ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond? \nSIDNEY He's not going to tell the truth! He was diving for the gold! \nHarmsway sits, and addresses Bond, matter-of-factly: \nHARMSWAY It seems - Mr. Bond - that Miss Winch has told me the most incredible story: A sunken British warship filled with gold; a British cutter firing on her; billions of dollars in bullion lying on the bottom of the Strait. \nBond isn't enjoying this charade. \nHARMSWAY Obviously, the British government denies all of this - \nSIDNEY - I told you! He was there! - \nHARMSWAY - But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond? \nBefore Bond can answer - \nSIDNEY But I have proof! You ran out of here so fast, I didn't get to show you. \nBond and Harmsway react - with entirely different concerns: Harmsway wasn't expecting her to have proof; Bond knows that if she shows him the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) Harmsway will probably kill both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses. \nSTAMPER No. Get the fire ax. \nOne of the guards grabs it from inside a FIRE CABINET. He hands the AX to Stamper, who takes the first SWING AT THE DOOR. \nRETURN ON BOND - TERRACE SET-BACK - EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT - \nBond is positioning the window washer rig. He explains: \nBOND We'll go down close to the sky bridge. We may be able to swing over and use it for cover. \nAs Bond climbs into the bucket, Sidney peers over the side. \nSIDNEY No way. I sail. I do not fly. \nBANG! Behind them, Stamper's AX HAS JUST PENETRATED THE DOOR. \nBOND ... Sometimes, you just have to take the plunge. \nBond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts down, as fast as they can go. \nEXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - AERIAL - \nBond and Sidney descend. Tiny specs against the sunset. \nINT. STAIRCASE - \nStamper gives the last few chops to the door. He kicks it open. \nEXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - \nStamper and the guards rush to the ledge. \nBOND AND SIDNEY - DESCENDING ON THE RIG - 60TH FLOOR - \nBond, looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their progress. \nSIDNEY All I know is one thing: If we get out of here alive, that gold is mine. (beat) I've earned it. \nLooking upward, Bond SEES STAMPER peering over the rail. BOND FIRES. \nBOND One thing at a time. \nEXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - TWILIGHT - \nStamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged. Ax in hand, he moves to the WINDOW WASHING RIG'S MACHINERY - \nAnd takes a roundhouse swing at the UNSPOOLING CABLE - but instead of cutting it, the ax BOUNCES OFF, and the RIG SLIDES ON ITS TRACKS. \nTHE RIG - (STILL DESCENDING) - \nSwings! Sidney SCREAMS - almost falling out. Bond grabs her. They are now 5 STORIES DIRECTLY ABOVE THE SKY BRIDGE, swaying like a giant pendulum - although still descending. \nRETURN ON STAMPER - TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT - \nHaving failed at the cable, Stamper goes at the PULLEY feeding it. He swings. Swings again. With each blow, the pulley shaft weakens. \nBOND AND SIDNEY - (WINDOW WASHER'S RIG) - \nDropping in VIOLENT SPURTS - just trying to stay in the damn bucket. \nSTAMPER - WIELDING THE AX - \nFinally, the pulley shaft SHATTERS. THE CABLE GRINDS TO A HALT. \nBOND AND SIDNEY - \nare stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge. \nSIDNEY (panicked, anxious, fast) What now? And don't give me some movie clich\u00e9 like 'trust me.' \nBOND (what the hell) Trust me. \nAnd with this, he turns, and SHOOTS OUT the adjacent WINDOW. \nBOND Let's go - \nBut as he starts to climb out - SIDNEY SCREAMS! THE CABLE SUDDENLY DROPS THEM 10 FEET LOWER, BELOW THE WINDOW. \nTHE TERRACE SET-BACK - \nStamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum. It's coming loose from its moorings. \nBOND AND SIDNEY - \nlook down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what (she thinks) is certain death: \nSIDNEY We're going to bounce off that thing! \nBond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before Stamper cuts the cable. HE GRABS HER: \nBOND Hold on! \nTERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT - \nStamper takes a final swing at the cable drum. With a GREAT CLAT- TERING SOUND it SNAPS FREE OF THE MOORINGS, smashes into the wall, and the whole mechanism CAREENS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING. \nTHE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - \nBond and Sidney feel the cable give way. They start to free-fall. \nBOND - FIRES HIS MACHINE PISTOL at the glass top of the sky bridge. \nTHE BULLETS SHATTER THE GLASS - \nBOND AND SIDNEY CRASH THROUGH, INTO - \nINT. 50TH FLOOR SKY BRIDGE - \nLanding on the deck of the bridge. Bond rolls to his feet as - \nFifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck. Bond yanks Sidney to the side of the building, just as THE CABLE DRUM, PULLEY, AND THE REST OF THE MECHANICS CRASH ON THE WALK-WAY. \n72ND FLOOR TERRACE SET-BACK - \nLooking down, Stamper flips open his radio. \nSTAMPER (over radio) They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor! \nINT. SECURITY CENTER - \nHARMSWAY (looking at the monitors) I should have hired this man. (to his guards) Get somebody up there! \nINT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT - \nBond is moving to the window washer rig debris. \nSIDNEY What about the elevators? \nHe steps to the side of the bridge, and looks at the railings: Four inch pipe. Bond begins to work feverishly: \nBOND We tried that already. Remember? \nINT. GARAGE - HARMSWAY TOWERS. \nBond and Sidney come out near a TROLLEY stacked with newspapers. \nHearts pounding - having left the pressroom's deafening noise - they're ready for almost anything, except what they HEAR: \nThe SOUND OF ONE MAN APPLAUDING. A polite, almost bored clapping. \nHARMSWAY (O.S.) Vert, very, good Mr. Bond. Outstanding performance. \nHarmsway is standing with TEN GUARDS, shoulder to shoulder, in a straight line, all HOLDING WEAPONS on Sidney and Bond. \nHARMSWAY (continuing) I'm the certain the British taxpayers would be impressed by your efforts. Don't you agree? \nBOND I think they'd rather know who stole their gold. \nHarmsway can't help his ego: \nHARMSWAY (chuckles) Why, I did, of course. It's on the Sea Dolphin II, twenty miles outside of Hong Kong... Not that it will do either of you any good to know. (beat) Now both of you: Stand up. And toss the gun out, Mr. Bond. \nBond SLIDES THE GUN several feet in front of him... And THROWS A LOOK TO HIS CAR, noting THE GUARDS ARE LINED UP DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH. Bond begins to scheme. \nSIDNEY Uncle Elliot: How could you do this to me? \nBond sneaks his hand in his pocket. \nHARMSWAY Oh, please, Sidney. There's a hundred billion dollars at stake. (beat) Besides, I never really liked your father that much. He cheated at cards. \nBond has removed the CAR REMOTE CONTROL. He palms it. \nBOND Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl? \nHARMSWAY My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain. (beat) Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward. \nHolding the remote control, Bond puts his hands on his head. He's manipulating the control into the right position to use it. \nBOND (trying to buy time) What did you do, Harmsway? Make some deal with the Chinese government for the gold?.. Was the radioactive uranium I found in Venice part of it? \nHe finally has the remote control in the right position. \nHARMSWAY Questions, questions, Mr. Bond... Which I'm afraid I've neither the time, nor the inclination to answer. (to the guards) Take them out to the jungle and - \nSuddenly, BOND'S CAR ENGINE STARTS WITH A ROAR. The GUARDS TURN, in shock TOWARDS THE CAR, as: \nBOND retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls Sidney behind the newspaper trolley, while - \nTHE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE, sending the guards scrambling. \nBOND takes his position with Sidney. \nBOND I forgot to mention: The job comes with a car. \n007 begins shooting, as - \nHARMSWAY Kill it! Shoot the damn thing - \nTHE GUARDS START BLASTING THE EMPTY MOVING CAR. They manage to shoot out the headlights, while - \nBOND is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same time. As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them - \nBOND Here. You shoot. I'll drive. \nSIDNEY ...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship. \nBOND Another reason??? Did I miss something??? \nSIDNEY (taking the gun) You insist on calling all the shots. (beat) And by the way: I am not a helpless girl. \nBond eyes her for one split second. Points at the guards: \nBOND Aim that way. \nSidney starts to shoot as - \nTHE GUARDS continue to blast away at the car... But: \nTHE WINDOWS DON'T SHATTER. \nTHE ARMOR-PLATED SIDE-PANELS ONLY DENT WITH BULLET HITS... \nTHE TIRES DON'T GO FLAT. \nThere's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as BOND STEERS THE CAR TO THEIR POSITION, where the door opens automatically. \nBOND Ready? Now! \nThe two of them make a break for the car, DIVING INSIDE. \nINT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - GARAGE - \n- Bond guns the engine, slams the transmission into gear. Burning rubber, GUARDS bounce off the front fenders. \nTHE GUARDS - \nContinue to shoot at the car. \nOTHER GUARDS - \nRun for the HUM-VEES. Hop in and chase. \nINT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) - \nBond flips open a hidden control panel. Flips a switch. \nEXT. BACK OF BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) - \nThe TAIL-LIGHTS DROP DOWN and MACHINE GUNS start to fire. \nINT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) - \nBond glances at the REARVIEW MIRROR. Sees the HUM-VEES. Presses another switch - \nCLOSE ON BOND'S EXHAUST PIPE - \nWhoosh! A MISSILE blasts out, trailing smoke as it hones in on - \nTHE FIRST HUM-VEE. \nBOOM! It's decimated. \nANGLE ON HARMSWAY - ON HIS RADIO - \nHARMSWAY Seal the garage! Cut the power! He's got no headlamps! \nINT. GARAGE - FIRST TURN - \nAs the car screeches around a corner, the overhead lights go out. \nINT. BOND'S CAR - \nBond flips down the visor: A THERMAL IMAGING DISPLAY drops down. \nYUNG (to the half-dozen engineers) I'm sorry to interrupt again. But we need one more picture for the story. \nThe engineers ad-lib replies: \"Sure.\" \"Okay.\" Yung smiles: \nYUNG (CONT'D) Why don't you line up against the wall? Let's make it a group shot. \nThe engineers line up against a wall. The cameramen take positions for a massacre. And at the first sound of gunfire, we cut to: \nEXT. ENTRANCEWAY - \nStamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in handcuffs. \nBOND Sleep well? \nSIDNEY Next time, I do the driving. \nBond gives her a look. \nRETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM - \nHarmsway and Yung are locking down at the VIDEO SCREEN of a portable version of the \"worm\" controller we saw on the SEA DOLPHIN II. \nYUNG The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel. \nHARMSWAY Excellent. \nHarmsway looks up, hearing: \nBOND I see you're in your natural element, Harmsway: A room filled with lethal power... (beat) ...With a toxic core at its center. \nHarmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at gun point,) with Stamper and a guard. Harmsway is charming as ever: \nHARMSWAY Do come in Mr. Bond, Sidney... You're just in time for a nuclear meltdown! \nComing closer, Sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him - \nSIDNEY You bastard - \nStamper restrains her, while Bond scans the room for an advantage. He sees a MACHINE PISTOL on the console. \nHARMSWAY Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly. \nYUNG (calling from the console) Approaching the first gate. \nHARMSWAY Start the grinders. \nUNDERWATER - POWER PLANT INTAKE TUNNEL - \nThe \"worm\" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars. \nRETURN ON CONTROL ROOM - \nBOND ...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for. \nHARMSWAY Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor... (beat) And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium - \nBOND - Instant melt-down. \nHARMSWAY Chernobyl will look like a campfire. \nYoung calls out again, with a hint of urgency. Bond decides to try rattling Harmsway - so he can move Closer to the gun, unnoticed. \nYUNG We're through the first gate. Approaching the second - \nBOND (demanding) Why, Harmsway? Wasn't stealing the gold enough? \nHARMSWAY (to Yung) Bore through. (to Bond, chuckling) ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond. (beat) They're wrong. (beat) Revenge is the best revenge. \nYUNG Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target - \nBOND (fiercely) What could you possibly have to be vengeful for, Harmsway? Still trying to prove yourself to daddy? \nThis infuriates Harmsway. Bond moves closer to the gun. \nHARMSWAY Hong Kong, Mr. Bond! \nYUNG You have to leave - \nHARMSWAY (enraged, ignoring Yung) A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization. (beat) And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock. (beat) The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen. \nBOND (to Sidney, glancing at the gun) ... I think Uncle Elliot is having his own melt-down. \nYUNG Approaching the third gate - \nHARMSWAY Smash through it! (then) Laugh all you'd like, Mr. Bond - but you fit perfectly in to my plans. (he reaches for a newspaper) Here. This just in. Newsflash. Read all about it. \nHe thrusts an issue of TOMORROW at Bond, holding the top half out as Bond reads THE HEADLINES, sourly: \nBOND ... Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear meltdown... British agent found in reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway calls for British government to resign. \nHarmsway smiles at Bond: \nHARMSWAY ...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies. \nBOND What about the gold? \nYUNG You must go. Now. Otherwise the boat won't be out of range - \nStamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave - \nHARMSWAY Thirty seconds. (then, to Bond) That's the most brilliant part of the plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy, I'll let the new British government - my British government - announce that the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong - where no one will be able to touch it for a hundred years. (beat) And just by coincidence: \nHe turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline: \nHARMSWAY ...Gold mine opens in Vietnam. (turns to Stamper) Let's go. Put them in the airlock. \nStamper moves towards Bond and Sidney. Bond edges closer to the gun. \nBOND You'll never get away with it, Harmsway. Too many people know. \nBond tenses, ready to spring - \nHARMSWAY Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the crazies - the conspiracy theorists? The Oliver Stones of the world? (pausing, then, with great scorn:) I'll publish their books, I'll make their movies, I'll put them on my TV shows! (beat) They're my bellboys. They carry my luggage. \nBond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! Bond frowns. \nHARMSWAY Now. Get them in the airlock. \nFortunately, Bond has a back-up plan. As Stamper hustles them off - \nBOND One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And the handcuffs. They'll give it away. \nHarmsway considers this for a second. Sidney takes Bond's arm. \nSIDNEY No. I want to stay with him. \nBond looks at her. He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he realizes he's developed feelings for her. He knows that if he could hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper \"You're a hell of a girl\"... \nBut at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone. \nHARMSWAY (breaking the moment, cynically) How sweet. \nIn the white smoke, Yung drops the gun... Then CHARGES at Bond, headbutting him, twisting, and turning 007... SMASHING BOND BACKWARDS AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOW. \nTHE WINDOW SHATTERS. Bond is winded. And as he struggles to stop himself from falling backwards into the reactor room... \nYung does a FLYING, FEET FIRST KICK to finish the job - \nBut at the last second, BOND DUCKS, reaches up, and uses Yung's momentum to send him flying over Bond's head into - \nTHE REACTOR ROOM. \nHe sails through the air, heading for the cooling pool 20' below, as - \nTHE WORM CLOSES IN ON THE SILVER REACTOR CORE. \nSCREAMING, YUNG HITS THE WATER FEET FIRST, AND - \nUNDERWATER (REACTOR CORE) - \nTHE WORM BURROWS IN ON HIM. \nRETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM - \nBond races to hit the \"EMERGENCY REACTOR SHUT DOWN\" button. He pulls a FIRE ALARM, disconnects the worm, and sets off an \"EMERGENCY DECONTAMINATION\" system, spraying the room with a mist of water. \nFinally, Bond retrieves the gun, and pauses to look down at: \nTHE REACTOR POOL (BOND'S POV) - \nThere's a cloud of RED in the middle of the blue water. \nRETURN TO SCENE - \nBond goes to the dead guard. Gets the key, removes his handcuff bracelets, then hoists the dead guard over his shoulder, and exits. \nEXT. HELICOPTER - (EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR POWER PLANT) - DAY \nWith the sound of fire engines approaching in the background, Bond straps the dead guard into the passenger seat, and takes off. \nEXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II - (AERIAL - SOUTH CHINA SEA) - DAY \nThe HNN boat has pulled alongside the Sea Dolphin II. The gang from the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat. \n(Note: From the air, we should notice that the \"gold hold\" is now covered by a steel hatch, and the biggest worm is stored in the open, hanging from a steel boom.) \nTHE DECK - \nComing up the ladder first, Harmsway is greeted by the Captain. \nHARMSWAY Any news? \nTHE CAPTAIN The call just went out on the Hong Kong police radio: Fire at the power plant. \nHARMSWAY (ironically) Alert the media! \nStamper and Sidney have climbed onto the deck. \nSTAMPER What do you want me to do with her? \nSIDNEY - Can't we make a deal? I won't say anything - \nHARMSWAY (touching her cheek) You're so cute, my dear. (beat) But I'm afraid not. (to one of the cameramen) Put her in the storage room. \nThe cameraman takes her away. Harmsway turns to the captain: \nHARMSWAY (CONT'D) We'll get rid of her when we're in International waters. (then) Set sail, full speed, due south. I'll be in my cabin. Let me know when Mr. Yung arrives. We'll break out the champagne. \nINT. LOWER PASSAGEWAY/STORAGE ROOM - SEA DOLPHIN II - \nNear the engine room (indicating we're near the bottom of the boat,) the cameraman opens a door to a small, cramped room with a bench, and SCUBA EQUIPMENT. He pushes Sidney inside. \nCAMERAMAN Don't get any ideas. \nThen locks the door on her. \nEXT. BOND'S HNN HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY \nSeveral hundred feet in the air, the helicopter is heading for an island in the distance. \nINT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - \nBond checks the compass, and adjusts his course. The COMPASS SWINGS DUE SOUTH. \nBOND'S POV - \nThe helicopter clears the island: Bright blue sea ahead. Bond sees then passes over - the HNN boat, bobbing empty in the water... \nThen, further ahead, he spots the stern of Sea Dolphin II, shimmering in the instance. \nREAR DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II - \nLooking north, off the back of the boat Stamper and a crewman see the helicopter - a tiny speck in the air. \nSTAMPER There it is. \nStamper lifts a pair of BINOCULARS for confirmation. \nSTAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - \nHe sees two figures in the cockpit. \nRETURN TO SCENE - \nStamper picks up his radio: \nSTAMPER It's him. They both made it. \nTHE BRIDGE - \nThe Captain replies: \nTHE CAPTAIN I'll tell Sir Elliot. \nHARMSWAY'S CABIN - \nHarmsway is working at a computer. A chime sounds. \nHARMSWAY Yes? \nCAPTAIN'S VOICE He's approaching from the north, sir. \nCREWMAN Fantastic. Invite the crew on deck to celebrate, and I'll be up in a few minutes. \nINT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY - \nBond is about two miles out from the stern of the Sea Dolphin II. Maybe 500' in the air. \nTaking the machine pistol from the dead guard's lap, he opens the small pilot's window, and balances it on his knees. Ahead, he sees: \nBOND'S POV - DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II - \nThe crewmen are lining up on either side of the landing pad, near the ship's railings. \nINT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT - \nSidney looks up, hearing and feeling the explosion. \nINT. BRIDGE - \nHarmsway regains control of the boat; he TAKES A GUN from the dead captain, and pushes the body out. \nEXT. PASSAGEWAY - \nWith FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship. \n(Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.) \nArriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the passageway, then pokes his head inside - \nAnd is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown against a railing. \nBond looks up: \nSTAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached to the boom by a thin metal cable. \nSTAMPER You're mine now. \nBond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch. With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck. \nAs Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON on a wall, and THE WORM comes to life. \nStamper closes in on Bond with the worm. \nBond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond against the wall with his free hand as he - \nMANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD. \nWith the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose - \nSTAMPER I'm going to do this slowly - \nBond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm - \nBut by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is rushing at Bond full force, with the worm. \nStamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews into the wall. \nPulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond. \nINSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE - \nWith all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in the cable, on the ground. \nRETURN TO SCENE - \nStamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain - \nAnd the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP. \nUNDERWATER - \nThe grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull. \nSIDNEY - (INT. STORAGE ROOM) - \nHears a strange vibrating sound from the wall. \nHARMSWAY - (INT. BRIDGE) - \nHARMSWAY (barking into the radio) Stamper! Report in! \nEXT. DECK/PASSAGEWAY - \nAs Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick - \nHARMSWAY'S VOICE (continuing, on Stamper's radio) Report to the bridge! \nBOND rushes to A SMALL PILE OF SLACK CABLE, which is rapidly growing taught as the worm wends its way underwater. \nStamper rushes Bond - \nAnd in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around Stamper's neck. \nSuddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS, and - \nSTAMPER soars 15 in the air, HANGING BY HIS NECK, as - \nINT. STORAGE CABIN - \nTHE WORM BURSTS THROUGH THE WALL! A torrent of water floods in, pushing Sidney off to one side. \nWORM'S POV - INT. STORAGE CABIN - \nIt's zooming at the door! \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - \nThe door bursts open, sending tons of water into the passageway. \nINT. BRIDGE - \nThe boat shudders violently, sending Harmsway crashing against a wall, cutting his head. \nEXT. THE DECK - \nAs the boat rocks, Bond steadies himself, then starts for the bridge, using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper: \nFirst climbing up on some machinery, then up onto the bridge roof. \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - \nSidney is thrashing for air, with only a few inches left between the rising water and the ceiling. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - \n3/4 filled with water. Rising fast. \nTHE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY) \nThe worm is heading for a door. We see the door disintegrate in front of us, as the worm bursts into - \nTHE ENGINE ROOM. \nWith the water cascading over the camera, (as if we were riding inside an ocean wave,) the worm heads for a tank marked \"FUEL.\" \nEXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II - \nThe boat is sinking. Bond is running across the bridge roof, when: THE BOAT SUDDENLY LISTS TO THE STARBOARD SIDE. \nINT. BRIDGE - \nHarmsway is thrown backwards. Gun in hand, he makes his way up the incline, to the port-side door. \nJust when he thinks he's made it - \n", "test1_input": "INT. CAFE - \nDiGiacomo sees the BLUE LASER. Motions his men to action. \nRETURN ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE - \nBond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain ac inconspicuous as possible. A hand clasps his shoulder: \nVALENTIN'S VOICE Mr. James Bond! \nBond spins to see Valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of cheaply dressed goons. \nBOND Valentin. What an unpleasant surprise. \nVALENTIN What is it that brings you to Venezia, Mr. Bond? Business - (sly glance to the thugs) Or somebody else's business? \nThe goons chortle. Bond isn't happy with this attention. He clocks a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON ONE OF THE MASTS, scanning the deck. \nA WOMAN'S SHRILL WHINING VOICE - brings Bond back to Valentin. She is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos. \nSOFIA Dimitri!!! You promised I could go shopping!! \nVALENTIN (sotto, to Bond) New mistress. (to her, impatiently) So? Go! \nSOFIA I need money. \nValentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH. \nVALENTIN Here. Take an inch. \nShaking his head, Valentin turns back to Bond: \nVALENTIN Come. Let me buy you a drink. It's free. \nWith Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move several steps to the bar. \nVALENTIN (to the bartender) Two vodka martini's. Shaken. Not stirred. (to Bond) And you? \nBond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his regular behavior might arouse suspicion. \nBOND One. \nAs the bartender pours: \nBOND I must say, Valentin, capitalism seems to be treating you well. \nVALENTIN (belting one back) I used to sell weapons; now I buy votes. (then) Off the record. \nBOND Of course. If you can't beat the government, you might as well own it. \nValentin spots someone off-camera. \nVALENTIN Wait - I want you to meet a friend of mine. (calling out) Elliot! Elliot! Come here. \nHarmsway appears. Ebullient as ever. \nVALENTIN Elliot Harmsway, I want to introduce you to an old friend - \nBOND (putting out a hand to shake) The name is Bond. James Bond. \nHarmsway greets Bond with a warm smile. Yet his words are ambiguous: \nHARMSWAY Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects... (a nod to Valentin) Especially one with such distinguished friends. \nBOND You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers. \nVALENTIN (chortling) 'Biggest followers?' He's practically made a career' of it!! \nHe laughs. Bond decides to pull Harmsway's chain. \nBOND It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark. \nHARMSWAY (smiles) I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond. (signaling off camera) Darling! Come here. (beat) I want you to meet my wife. \nA woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. As she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond - \nHARMSWAY Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce you to James Bond. \nThere is a terrified look on her face. Harmsway continues, beaming his most insinuating smile: \nHARMSWAY But then... I believe you two have already met. \nThere is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. Then - \nPOLICE WHISTLES BLOW! SIRENS! SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING TO A HALT! \nThe entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by UZI- TOTING CARBINIERI, along with his own VIDEO AND STILL CREWS. \nDiGIACOMO Elliot Harmsway: Under the auspices of the Italian government, I, Franco DiGiacomo - (pauses; smiles at a camera; POP! A flash goes off) Am arresting you for the illegal possession of weapons grade enriched uranium. (to his underlings) Seize the boat! \nA set of frozen glances goes from Bond, to Paris, to Harmsway. \nVALENTIN I think I suddenly remembered an urgent meeting in Moscow. \nTo everyone's surprise, Harmsway guffaws. \nHARMSWAY My friends, there's been a terrible mistake. (putting his arm around DiGiacomo) Come. Let me show you. \nAnd he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. Bond is left with Paris. She is white with fear. Bond moves to console her: \nBOND Paris - \nPARIS Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!! \nBOND Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files? \nPARIS (anguished) He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image. (beat) You've got to protect me! \nBond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway. He pulls out a key: \nBOND Go to my hotel room. I'll be there in twenty minutes. \nParis looks up at him like a hurt child. She wants some contact; she wants to hear him say 'I love you.' \nPARIS Just - say it. Say it just once. \nBOND (pauses, discomfited) One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go. \nShe exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... And we pan up to see the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, following him. \nINT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II - \nHarmsway holds court near the red box. Bond squeezes in. \nHARMSWAY I believe this is what you're looking for, Colonel. \nHe opens the red box. Hoists out a canister. \nHARMSWAY Is it uranium? Absolutely. But watch - (runs the Geiger counter over it) It's depleted uranium! Completely safe! A child could sleep on it. \nBond can't believe what he's seeing. DiGiacomo is mortified. \n", "test1_true": "DiGIACOMO Signore Harmsway. A thousand apologies. (snaps his fingers to a lackey:) Give him the video tape. \nHARMSWAY Please. No harm done, Don Franco. Go upstairs, and enjoy the reception. \nAs the room empties, he calls - \nHARMSWAY Oh - Mr. Bond. One minute. \nBond approaches him. They're the only people in the room. \nHARMSWAY I hope you've enjoyed this little charade. \nBOND Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours? \nHARMSWAY (icily) A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. (beat) It's deadlier than uranium. \nBOND (staring him down) We'll see about that. \nHarmsway glances at his watch. Smiles coldly. \nHARMSWAY Aren't you late for a meeting? \nEXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II/HARBOR - DAY \nBond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock. Jumps in a gondola. \nBOND The Danielli. Presto! \nRETURN ON THE METALLURGY LAB - \nHarmsway closes the door. Yung is there. \nYUNG That was too close. \nHARMSWAY Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss. \nHarmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards. \nHARMSWAY I'm going to the plane. Tell the captain to set sail at once. \nEXT. THE DANIELLI HOTEL - DAY \nBond jumps out of the gondola, sprints into the lobby. \nFOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - \nBond appears, rushing up a staircase. He comes to his doorway. It's closed, but unlocked. \nINT. BOND'S HOTEL ROOM - \nBond enters the room. Looks around, calling out - \nBOND Paris? Paris? \nHe sees the French doors open onto the canal. The curtains billowing outward. Bond rushes to the window and looks down: \nEXT. GRAND CANAL - BOND'S POV \nParis Harmsway is dead, floating in the water. \nRETURN ON BOND - \nCrushed. Devastated. And to make matters worse: \nDiGIACOMO'S VOICE Signore Bond? \nBond turns. A flashbulb goes off, capturing Bond and DiGiacomo. \nDiGIACOMO You're under arrest. \nCUT TO: \nTHE SOUTH CHINA SEA - DUSK \nThe HMS INDOMITABLE - a 3,300 ton British frigate, surges through the water, heading toward the setting sun. \nCLOSER - \nBATTLE-DRESSED ROYAL MARINES patrol the deck; GUNNERY CREWS man the weapons. Whatever is going on here, it's not business as usual.' \nINT. BRIDGE - DUSK \nClose on A VERTICAL GLASS MAP. An electronic panel display with a BLINKING YELLOW DOT indicates - \nNAVIGATOR We've cleared Hong Kong harbor, sir. \nTHE CAPTAIN nods. Turns to the GPS OFFICER: \nCAPTAIN Position? \nThe GPS officer enters keyboard commands on console marked \"GLOBAL POSITIONING SATELLITE.\" He reads out the data: \nGPS OFFICER Two-two, zed-three, one-five north; a hundred fourteen degrees, five minutes, ten seconds east. \nCAPTAIN Mark. \nGPS OFFICER Locked on satellite, sir. \nCAPTAIN Set course, two-ten degrees, south south east. \nNAVIGATOR Coming about, sir. \nThe Captain is all business - clipped, sober terse. Turns to his FIRST OFFICER, hands him a SLIP OF PAPER: \nCAPTAIN Orders from London: For the next ninety-six hours, we're to run on full radio silence. Double watches, full alert. (beat) We're to send one encrypted positioning burst to London every six hours - otherwise, zero electronic emissions. \nThe first officer nods. \nCAPTAIN (cont'd) Inform the men, then run a surprise inspection. If someone paints us, I don't want this ship showing up on their radar screen like some god-damned Harrod's Christmas tree. \nFIRST OFFICER Yes, sir! \nCAPTAIN I'll be in my cabin until oh-six- hundred hours. \nThe Captain heads for the door. \nSECOND OFFICER Captain leaving the bridge. \nThe officers salute as he exits. With a shrug, the FIRST OFFICER picks up the INTERCOM MICROPHONE: \nFIRST OFFICER Attention all hands. Now hear this... \nINT. CREW'S MESS - \nCrowded with CREW MEMBERS eating, waiting on line for food. \nFIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM) We will rig immediately for electronic silence. All electronic gear is to be shut down... \nCLOSE ON COOK - KITCHEN - \n", "test1_id": 2862, "test2_input": "But BOND hesitates, LOOKING BACK AT THE TECHNICIAN with the URANIUM. 007 wants to get it, but Taro nudges him out with the gun muzzle. \nEXT. MALACCA STRAIT - DAY \nA BRITISH NAVAL CUTTER is pulling alongside the barge - SEA SIREN WAILING, crew members in battle gear, FORWARD GATLING GUN manned. \nCAPTAIN MORTON (on bullhorn) Attention sea barge: Lay down your weapons, and prepare to be boarded. \nON THE BARGE - Sidney and Co. stand, weapons ready. \nCAPTAIN MORTON Repeat: Lay down your weapons, and prepare to be boarded. \nBond turns to Sidney, who's grabbed a bullhorn of her own. \nBOND If I were you - \nSIDNEY - You're not. \nBOND (as she hoists the bullhorn) Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there. \nSIDNEY Thank you. (clicks it on, and:) \"Now hear this: Drop dead.\" \nBond and Wade exchange an amused/helpless glance - as if they both know what's coming next. There's a pause, then - \nTHE CRUISER'S GATLING GUN ERUPTS WITH AN EARDRUM-SHATTERING SALVO. It's only a warning shot, but - \nEVERYONE ON THE BARGE DIVES FOR THE DECK... Except for Bond and Wade, who might as well be having tea. Bond looks down at Taro, cowering on the boards. \nBOND Gatling gun beats Uzi. \nNEW ANGLE - (CUTTER/BARGE) - DAY \nAn ARMED BOARDING PARTY is coming across an aluminum bridge that has extended from the Cutter onto the barge. \nCAPTAIN MORTON (a tiny popinjay) Who's in charge here? \nSIDNEY I am. What do you want? \nCAPTAIN MORTON You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way. \nSIDNEY Forget it. No way. I got here first. \nCAPTAIN MORTON (ignoring her) Who's Wade? \nWADE That would be me - \nCAPTAIN MORTON (snidely) Thanks for your message. (turns to) And you're Bond? \nBOND Yes - \nCAPTAIN MORTON Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter! \nBond and Wade are stunned. The Marines move in. Bond struggles - \nBOND Wait a minute - \nCAPTAIN MORTON Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him. \nAs TWO MARINES with automatic rifles take Bond and Wade across the folding bridge - \nSIDNEY (demanding) What's your name? \nCAPTAIN MORTON Captain Morton. \nPause. She expects him to ask \"And yours?\" but he doesn't. \nSIDNEY My name is Sidney Winch, and - \nCAPTAIN MORTON Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here. \nSIDNEY (furiously) I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck. \nCAPTAIN MORTON Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney. \nSIDNEY I was an attorney! \nCAPTAIN MORTON Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession. (beat) Ten seconds. Are you leaving? \nSIDNEY No. \nCAPTAIN MORTON You leave me no alternative. \nCAPTAIN MORTON (upholstering a walkie-talkie) Cut her anchor. \nAs Sidney yells \"NO!\" - THE FORWARD GATLING GUN erupts to life. One short, bone rattling burst CUTS THE CHAIN. \nSIDNEY You won't get away with this! \nCAPTAIN MORTON (stepping onto the bridge) Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground. \nAs she floats away, Sidney calls out to the Captain, Bond and Wade: \nSIDNEY You bastards! Believe me - you haven't heard the last of me! \nEXT. DECK - THE CUTTER - DAY - \nBond, Wade and the Captain. \nWADE - Nice trick with the arrest. Very convincing. \nCAPTAIN MORTON It's no trick, Mr. Wade. I've got half a mind to throw both of you in the brig. \nBOND Don't you think you're overreacting? \nCAPTAIN MORTON (with great sarcasm) Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy - (Wade reacts) Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide. \nBOND (Calmly) ...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing: (beat) There's no gold down there. \nCAPTAIN MORTON What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there? \nBOND Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone. \nCAPTAIN MORTON That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold. \nBOND I know what I saw - \nCAPTAIN I don't care what you think you saw. You're a damned amateur. (beat) Just get off my ship. Go back to your trench-coats and your code names - and leave the job to professionals. \nBOND (exchanges a glance with Wade, then) Aye-aye, Captain. \nEXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY - \nAs Bond and Wade push away from the Naval Cutter: \nWADE Where to now, Jimbo? \nBOND (thinking) I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur. \nEXT. COASTAL ROADWAY - MALAYSIA - (BOND CAR) - DAY - \nBond'- car travels through the tropical landscape, turning at a sign for Kuala Lumpur. \n", "test2_true": "As Bond downshifts in anticipation of an upcoming hill, his CAR PHONE RINGS.

Bond picks up the phone. \nBOND Bond. \nHARMSWAY'S VOICE Hello, Mister Bond. \nBOND (with an edge) Who is this? \nINT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE - \nHarmsway is perched on a desk. In the background, THROUGH HIS OPEN OFFICE DOOR, we can see Harmsway's EXECUTIVE SECRETARY serving someone coffee from a SILVER TRAY - but we can't see who it is. \nHARMSWAY Elliot Harmsway! I heard you were in K.L. and thought we might get together for a chat... \nRETURN ON BOND - (INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING) - \nHARMSWAY (Cont'd, O.S.) We seemed to get off on the wrong foot back there in Venice. \nBOND How did you get this number? \nINTERCUT AS NECESSARY: \nHARMSWAY Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information. (Bond reacts, sourly) Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes? \nBOND I'm on my way. \nBond hangs up, and drives with renewed determination. \nINT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE - \nHarmsway hangs up; STAMPER is standing nearby. Harmsway throws a concerned glance at his office, then turns to Stamper: \nHARMSWAY Let's find out exactly what he knows. \nEXT. KUALA LUMPUR - ROADWAY -(BOND CAR) - LATE AFTERNOON - \nBond's car approaches the camera, passes it, and heads for HARMSWAY TOWERS, looming over Kuala Lumpur in the distance. \nEXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - STREET LEVEL - LATE AFTERNOON - \nBond's car passes the front of the building, and drives down a ramp into an underground car park. \nINT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - (HARMSWAY TOWERS) - \nPassing NEWSPAPER LOADING DOCKS (with trucks displaying both the \"TOMORROW\" and \"HNN\" logos, and HUM-VEES used by building security,) Bond pulls into the VALET AREA - \nWhere a cheerful YOUNG PR WOMAN and VALET wait. Both wear the colorful BLAZER used by all Harmsway Building service personnel. \nBOND (from inside the car) James Bond to see Elliot Harmsway. \nPR WOMAN Yes. I'm to bring you right up. The valet will take your car - \nBOND I'd prefer to park it myself. (off her questioning look) Temperamental. Practically has a mind of its own. \nPR WOMAN Don't they all? \nShe points to a spot near the loading docks. Bond drives off. \nINT. BOND'S CAR - \nBond backs into the space, thinking about the (inevitable) quick get- away. He looks through the windshield, surveying the area. \nBOND'S POV - UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - \nTWO BURLY SECURITY GUARDS (in Harmsway Blazers,) stand behind a bulletproof security desk. There's a METAL DETECTOR by the door. \nBACK TO SCENE (INT. BOND'S CAR) - \nReaching inside his jacket, Bond REMOVES HIS GUN, and HIDES IT in a compartment under the dashboard. \nINT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - \nThe PR WOMAN joins Bond as he locks the car with the REMOTE CONTROL. \nPR WOMAN Right this way. \nFollowing her through the metal detector, Bond scans the security devices at the guard's desk: Lots of cameras, sensors, and alarms. \nEXT. PRESSROOM OBSERVATION ARCADE - \nBond and the PR Woman step off an escalator onto an open arcade with GLASS WINDOWS looking down into a mammoth NEWSPAPER PRINTING PLANT. \nPR WOMAN (moving to a door) Mr. Harmsway is checking the afternoon editions. If you'll just follow me - \nINT. PRESSROOM BALCONY - \nThe NOISE FROM THE PRINTING PRESSES is deafening. Bond and the PR WOMAN walk down a METAL STAIRCASE to the pressroom floor, where - \nHarmsway (wearing a printer's smock and newsprint cap,) is joking with SEVERAL PRESSMEN - a fresh issue of \"Tomorrow\" outstretched in his hands. \nHARMSWAY (spotting Bond, yelling:) Mr. Bond! Nice to see you. \nBOND Sir Elliot. \nHARMSWAY Come. Let's get out of the noise. (escorting Bond off) - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk. \nINT. DRESSING ALCOVE - OFF THE PRESSROOM - \nHarmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads from the press room to an elevator. There's a SINK in the room. \nHARMSWAY It's funny, Mr. Bond. Of all the things I own, nothing gives me as much enjoyment as my newspapers. \nHe moves to the sink to wash his hands. Turns on the faucets: \nHARMSWAY (cont'd) Ironic, isn't it? In the age of TV, I still can't get the ink out of my veins. \nBond SMILES WRYLY, looking at Harmsway hunched over the sink: \nBOND Yes... A man with ink in his veins, and blood on his hands. \nHarmsway smiles to himself, acknowledging the jibe... But decides to ignore it. He turns off the faucet, dries his hands - \nHARMSWAY We print 31 newspapers here; another two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite plants around the world. \nHe pulls on his \u00a32000 Saville Row suit-jacket. \nBOND ... And how many of those newspapers carried Paris Harmsway's obituary? \nHarmsway turns, and presses the ELEVATOR BUTTON. The doors open, instantly. HE SMILES: \nHARMSWAY All of them, Mister Bond...

ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE THE ELEVATOR - (CONTINUOUS) - \nBond and Sidney rush forward to the front wall as - \nSTAMPER AND THE GUARD - \nRecover, grab their guns, move to the threshold, and START RAKING THE CEILING WITH GUNFIRE. \nELEVATOR SHAFT - \nBond presses his body against Sidney, on the front wall, trying to SHIELD HER as BULLETS RIP UP THE FLOOR behind them. With his free hand, Bond reaches up for the LATCH to open the door above them. \nINT. ELEVATOR - \nStamper stops shooting. Moves to the rear of the cab, under the escape panel. Peers up. Sees nothing. Turns to the Guard: \nSTAMPER Help me up. \nELEVATOR SHAFT - \nStamper's head pokes up through the hole just as Bond and Sidney have disappeared into - \nINT.

They're not to leave this building alive! \nBOND AND SIDNEY - (INT. HALLWAY) - \nMoving cautiously toward a CORNER of ANOTHER HALLWAY. \nSIDNEY This has got to be a mistake. \nBOND The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator. \nAt the corner, Bond STOPS, SEEING A GUARD, farther down the hall (his back to them) CHECKING DOORS. \nBOND Wait here. \nSIDNEY No. I'm going with you. \nBond frowns, but doesn't have the time to argue. They start doing a \"DUCK AND COVER\" in and out of doorways TO SNEAK UP ON HIM. \nINT. SECURITY CENTER - \nHarmsway bursts in on GUARDS watching a WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS. \nHARMSWAY Where are they? \nGUARD #1 I don't see them - (scanning the monitors) There! \nINSERT VIDEO MONITOR - (SURVEILLANCE SHOT OF HALLWAY) - \nBond and Sidney have just come into frame, sneaking up on the GUARD. \nHARMSWAY (OVER) Warn him! \nCLOSE ON THE GUARD - (INT. HALLWAY) - \nVOICE ON RADIO Porter! They're behind you - \nGUARD (lifting the radio to reply) Roger! Over and - \nBAM.

As Bond stands in the doorway, guarding them - \nSIDNEY Okay. So it wasn't a mistake. (Bond lets go a blast) What do we do now? Offer them dinner?!?! \nBond glances back at the KITCHEN SUPPLIES. GETS AN IDEA. He sud- denly TWISTS, SMASHING the BUTT OF HIS GUN down on some GLASSWARE on the counter, then TWISTS BACK, returning a BURST OF GUNFIRE. \nBOND Come here. You shoot. I'll cook. \nShe thinks he's nuts, but squeezes next to him. Handing her the gun: \nBOND Aim that way. \nSidney scowls - as Bond moves off-camera - when suddenly, BULLET HITS RIP UP THE DOOR FRAME. She jumps, TERRIFIED. \nBond looks at her from the PHOTO-COPYING MACHINE, where he is YANKING OUT the TONER CARTRIDGE. He offers a simple piece of advice: \nBOND Shoot back! \nSidney frowns... Turns... And as she LETS THE GUN RIP, we cut to: \nINT. STAIRWELL - (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING) - \nStamper, running up steps with the guard. They exit into: \nA SHORT SERVICE HALLWAY - 71ST.

The guards shoot; she shoots back, then explains: \nSIDNEY I used to be a divorce lawyer in New York City. \nBond nods, continuing to look at his watch. Glances at her: \nBOND Not a lot of difference. \nSIDNEY What do you mean? \nBond reaches forward to toss the coffee can - \nBOND Either way, you're taking the goods from dead hulks. \nHe tosses the can, and PULLS HER BACKWARDS, covering her. \nNEW ANGLE - THE HALLWAY - \nThe GUARDS spring from the door, rushing forward to storm Bond's position - just as the COFFEE CAN rolls towards them, and EXPLODES. \nRETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN - \nBOND Let's go - \nTaking the gun, the two of them start for the door when - \nNEW ANGLE - OPPOSITE END OF THE HALLWAY - CORNER - \nStamper and the GUARD have arrived at the corner, BLASTING. \nRETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN - \nBOND Damn! \nSwiftly, Bond grabs a JUG of CLEANER from under the sink, moves to the door, and ROLLS IT DOWN THE HALL in Stamper's direction. \nSTAMPER AND THE GUARD - (HALLWAY CORNER) - \nAnticipate a bomb.

TWISTING AROUND, Bond lets a BURST go in Stamper's direction, as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead guards' MAC-l0's. \nINSERT - BOND'S BULLETS RIP UP THE JUG OF CLEANER. \nBOND AND SIDNEY ESCAPE FROM THE HALLWAY - \nSTAMPER - \nCowers, waiting for the jug to blow up...

STAIRWELL - LANDING - \nSIDNEY Down? \nBond leans over the railing. Sees GUARDS coming UP. SHOOTS. \nBOND Up. \nThey go up about three stairs, and Sidney sees GUARDS descending. \nSIDNEY Down? \nBOND (shoots, then) Up. \nBond and Sidney bound up the stairs through a METAL DOOR, just as - \nINT. HALLWAY - \nStamper and the Guard bound down the hallway, heading for the door. \nINT. SECURITY CENTER - \nHarmsway smiles, watching Bond on a monitor: \nHARMSWAY ... And so much for that. (into radio) They're on the 72nd floor set-back. (explains to the guards) Nowhere to go. \nEXT. 72ND FLOOR - TERRACE SETBACK - TWILIGHT - \nIt's magic hour as Bond and Sidney rush out onto the setback. Bond sees a WINDOW WASHER'S RIG. And although Sidney asks - \nSIDNEY Now what? \nBond's first concern is to make sure Stamper can't get them. Amidst a pile of CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, he spots a PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN. He grabs it, and - \nBANG. BANG. BANG. He fires 3 NAILS through the door into the frame. \nBOND That should buy us some time. \nNow, Bond moves to the WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - a two-man bucket-like scaffold ON TRACKS, with TWO LEATHER SAFETY HARNESSES inside, and a LARGE CABLE SPOOL/MOTOR that stays on the roof. \nApproaching it, Bond looks over the side: \nBOND'S POV - LOOKING DOWN FROM 72ND FLOOR - \nTwenty stories below is the sky bridge. 50 stories below that, the ground. It's a long, long, way down. \nRETURN ON BOND - AT THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - TERRACE SET-BACK - \nBOND Help me move this. \nINT. STAIRWELL - \nDarting up the few steps, Stamper and Guards arrive at the door. He tries to open it. Won't budge. \nGUARD I'll call for a battering ram - \n", "test3_id": 2864}

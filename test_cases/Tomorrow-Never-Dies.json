Didn't Elliot Harmsway just move his headquarters to Kuala Lumpur? \nShe turns, freezes Bond with a look: \nM Contrary to what you may believe, 007, the world is not filled with mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes, stock them with big-breasted women, and threaten the world with nuclear annihilation. \nBond reacts to the comeuppance. She continues: \nM (cont'd) The case is closed. The Italian authorities ruled the girl a suicide. We had enough trouble keeping your name out of the media.

GENERAL LI (of the People's Revolutionary Army) is seated with a squad of lawyers: \nGENERAL LI And that is the fifth document. With your counter-signature, the sale will be complete. \nThe document is passed across to HARMSWAY, sitting with his own legal counsel. One of the men is WHISPERING TO HIM, INTENSELY: \nYOUNG CHINESE LAWYER Are you sure? If we waited - \nHarmsway waves the lawyer off, silencing him. Addresses the General: \nHARMSWAY General Li: My young associate here has just informed me that if I waited a year, I could perhaps receive a higher price for this building. (beat, wryly) He has great faith in Hong Kong. As did my ancestors. With obvious results. \nNervous chuckles around the table, but the General is reserved. \nHARMSWAY (cont'd) Yet to sell this building for more money - to profiteer - would run counter to the Chinese sprit of guanchi - mutual trust and obligation; it would violate the ancient principles of feng shui - (beat) - the reason we sign five documents instead of an unlucky four, and why this building has a fifth, non-functioning ventilation shaft on its roof. (beat) Wind and water, fire and rain, earth and sky - feng shui. All things - at one, in balance, with nature. \nGENERAL LI ...Most eloquently put, Sir Elliot. \nHARMSWAY Thank you, General Li. Now I'll just sign this last document - \nHe puts the pen to the paper, and BREAKS THE PEN. Alarmed looks. \nHARMSWAY (cont'd) Terribly sorry. Mr. Stamper? \nFrom behind, Stamper hands him a pen. Harmsway innocently starts to sign in RED INK - \nGENERAL LI Sir Elliot! Red ink - \nHARMSWAY Of course! How foolish. More bad luck. I'll just borrow yours - \nHe takes General Li's pen, and signs his name with a flourish. \nEXT. ROOF OF 'HARMSWAY BUILDING' - \nUnder the whirring blades of the chopper, Harmsway bids farewell to General Li. He and Stamper get in helicopter. \nCLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER - \nAs Harmsway waves good-bye from the window, the helicopter rises, REVEALING a METAL CABLE attached to the LANDING SKID. \nWIDER - \nThe cable leads to a spool, which runs to the FIFTH METAL VENTILATION SHAFT Harmsway referred to in the last scene. \nINT.

(explains) Man bites dog is a news story. Riots at the World Cup soccer finals is a social announcement. Next? \nNEWS EDITOR 4 This just came in: There's something up with the British Navy in the Strait. Rescue planes, helicopters; two ships supposedly sailing from the Persian gulf. They just chased away one of our news boats. \nHARMSWAY (feigning complete innocence) Is that so? \nNEWS EDITOR 4 Yeah. Sounds like a plane went down or something... Either way, they're calling it - all together now: \nALL AT TABLE \"A routine training exercise.\" \nHARMSWAY I'm shocked!!

COASTAL INLET - MARSHLAND - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY \nThe Sea King comes in above several police cars and boats. Bond jumps the last ten feet, and the chopper peels off. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Yo! Jimbo! \nBond turns to look: It's JACK WADE. \nBOND Wade, what the hell are you doing here? \nWADE I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong. \nBOND That's reassuring. \nWADE Hey - the world is my office. \nBOND Let's take a look at the body. \nAs Bond moves off, WADE SNIFFS THE AIR, savoring the aroma: \nWADE Smells like...

Shark attack? \nBond shakes his head grimly. \nBOND I don't think so. The veins are cauterized - as if they were sealed by heat... (beat, confounded) But there are no burn marks on the flesh. It doesn't make sense. (to the policeman) Who found the body? \nPOLICE OFFICER (points to) Dato. Local fisherman. Says it came in with the tide early this morning. \nBOND Ask him if it could have washed in from the west side of the Strait. \nThe POLICEMAN has an animated conversation with FISHERMAN. Then: \nPOLICEMAN No. He says it's not possible. The current could have only brought the body in from the east. \nBOND (to Wade) You have a boat? \nWADE I don't know if you'd call it a boat... \nBOND Something with an engine? Not oars? \nWADE Step into my office. \nEXT. 'THE RUNNING DOG' CIGARETTE BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY - \nSmashing through the water at breakneck speed. Wade and Bond yell over the engines. \nWADE What do you want with the Harbor Master? \nBOND Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank. (Wade nods appreciatively) Where did you get the boat? \nWADE Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.

A polite, almost bored clapping. \nHARMSWAY (O.S.) Vert, very, good Mr. Bond. Outstanding performance. \nHarmsway is standing with TEN GUARDS, shoulder to shoulder, in a straight line, all HOLDING WEAPONS on Sidney and Bond. \nHARMSWAY (continuing) I'm the certain the British taxpayers would be impressed by your efforts. Don't you agree? \nBOND I think they'd rather know who stole their gold. \nHarmsway can't help his ego: \nHARMSWAY (chuckles) Why, I did, of course. It's on the Sea Dolphin II, twenty miles outside of Hong Kong... Not that it will do either of you any good to know. (beat) Now both of you: Stand up. And toss the gun out, Mr. Bond. \nBond SLIDES THE GUN several feet in front of him... And THROWS A LOOK TO HIS CAR, noting THE GUARDS ARE LINED UP DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH. Bond begins to scheme. \nSIDNEY Uncle Elliot: How could you do this to me? \nBond sneaks his hand in his pocket. \nHARMSWAY Oh, please, Sidney. There's a hundred billion dollars at stake. (beat) Besides, I never really liked your father that much. He cheated at cards. \nBond has removed the CAR REMOTE CONTROL. He palms it. \nBOND Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl? \nHARMSWAY My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain. (beat) Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward. \nHolding the remote control, Bond puts his hands on his head. He's manipulating the control into the right position to use it. \nBOND (trying to buy time) What did you do, Harmsway? Make some deal with the Chinese government for the gold?.. Was the radioactive uranium I found in Venice part of it? \nHe finally has the remote control in the right position. \nHARMSWAY Questions, questions, Mr. Bond... Which I'm afraid I've neither the time, nor the inclination to answer. (to the guards) Take them out to the jungle and - \nSuddenly, BOND'S CAR ENGINE STARTS WITH A ROAR. The GUARDS TURN, in shock TOWARDS THE CAR, as: \nBOND retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls Sidney behind the newspaper trolley, while - \nTHE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE, sending the guards scrambling. \nBOND takes his position with Sidney. \nBOND I forgot to mention: The job comes with a car. \n007 begins shooting, as - \nHARMSWAY Kill it! Shoot the damn thing - \nTHE GUARDS START BLASTING THE EMPTY MOVING CAR. They manage to shoot out the headlights, while - \nBOND is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same time. As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them - \nBOND Here. You shoot. I'll drive. \nSIDNEY ...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship. \nBOND Another reason??? Did I miss something??? \nSIDNEY (taking the gun) You insist on calling all the shots. (beat) And by the way: I am not a helpless girl. \nBond eyes her for one split second.

But: \nTHE WINDOWS DON'T SHATTER. \nTHE ARMOR-PLATED SIDE-PANELS ONLY DENT WITH BULLET HITS... \nTHE TIRES DON'T GO FLAT. \nThere's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as BOND STEERS THE CAR TO THEIR POSITION, where the door opens automatically. \nBOND Ready? Now! \nThe two of them make a break for the car, DIVING INSIDE. \nINT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - GARAGE - \n- Bond guns the engine, slams the transmission into gear. Burning rubber, GUARDS bounce off the front fenders. \nTHE GUARDS - \nContinue to shoot at the car. \nOTHER GUARDS - \nRun for the HUM-VEES. Hop in and chase. \nINT.

A city street beyond. \nINT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - \nSIDNEY We're not going to make it! \nBond flips down a control panel from the RADIO. A DIGITAL DISPLAY begins to run through a set of numbers. Bond explains: \nBOND If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code. \nSIDNEY If not? \nBOND (pointing to a button) We blast through. \nTHE CAR APPROACHES THE CLOSING DOOR AT HIGH SPEED - \nBOND SEES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.

ABERDEEN HARBOR - HONG KONG - MORNING - \nIt is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where floating restaurant rise out of the fog; where an old Chinese man wearing an LA Laker's jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient junk; where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks, computer boxes and women dressed in Chanel 1996, and Beijing 1256...

POWER PLANT, FRONT ENTRANCE, WATERSIDE) - \nTwo VIDEO CAMERAMEN are shooting an ASIAN HNN REPORTER interviewing a middle-aged CHINESE MAN. We don't see the reporter's face; from the \"over the shoulder\" news angle, he's WEARING A HAT. \n(There's also HNN BELL JETRANGER HELICOPTER on the ground, and a seemingly empty HNN BOAT moored to a nearby pier.) \nASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (cont'd) - Interviewing Mr. David Chin, senior engineer in charge of security. (beat) Tell me, Mr. Chin: How safe is this plant from a terrorist attack? \nHe holds out a MICROPHONE to Chin. \nCHIN Totally secure.

You'd need - \nSuddenly, A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE EMERGES FROM THE MICROPHONE... And CHIN COLLAPSES.

ROCKETS shoot out from their lenses, destroying both. \nYUNG Let's go! \nAs Yung and the cameramen rush forward - \nANGLE ON THE HNN BOAT - \nHarmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box of equipment. He calls back to TWO MEN who have appeared on deck: \nHARMSWAY Get the machine in the water! \nThey begin using a hoist to lift one of the \"worms\" from a hold.

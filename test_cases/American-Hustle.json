In order to attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of, someone special, someone new, someone amazing.

Why you leaving me out of this? I gotta hear about it from my friends? \nIRVING ROSENFELD It ain't for you Carl. \nCARL ELWAY What do you mean it ain't for me? We gotta do certificates of deposit. I can print as many as you need. \nIRVING ROSENFELD This is not a one man operation. \nCARL ELWAY Look, I can get other guys. What are you talking about Irving? \nIRVING ROSENFELD You're telling me that you can get four guys to sell fake certificates of deposit to my investor within a week? \nThe camera zooms into Irving's shirt collar revealing a tiny microphone. \nCARL ELWAY Yes I can make that happen.

My boss Stoddard proceeded to tell me that Carmine Polito was the most quietly powerful person in the state of New Jersey. A lifetime native of the very racially mixed Camden, which had become a ghetto, and where he had been Mayor for ten years. A very beloved guy. A guy who never gave up on his people. His father had emigrated from Italy and had stoked coal. \n- Frank Sinatras COFFEE SONG, 1940s version, as we see Carmine talk to and dance joyfully with his kids and wife at breakfast. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) A big family guy with five kids. They even adopted some other kid. A black kid from the Boys and Girls Club who'd lost his family. I mean, his household was a joyous place. And his wife Dolly, she was the apple of his eye and the center of the household. I mean everyone loved this guy. \n- PULL OUT Mayor Polito walks up steps of City Hall as he greets a women and her baby; into his office greeted by a couple of AIDES who show him papers to sign. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

Why can't we employ people today to do work like this in rebuilding Atlantic City? \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) He worked with all the unions. He was the leader of the State Assembly. And he had just gotten gambling legalized in New Jersey to create jobs. \n80   -- FLOOR OF STATE ASSEMBLY -- Carmine huddles with other       80 STATE LEGISLATORS, horsetrading and then poses for a picture with other members of the State Assembly. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) But he couldn't get the funds to rebuild Atlantic City and that was his problem. So with our help, he was about to have his hand in the wrong pocket at the wrong time.

This is a bad idea, Richard. \nRICHIE DIMASO Shhhh. Look, it's really simple. All you need is to put two million in a Chase account -- \nSTODDARD THORSEN What?! \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) -- under the Sheik's name -- \nSTODDARD THORSEN Whose two million?! \nRICHIE DIMASO Shh, just listen. Two million dollars under the Sheik's name, in a Chase account that we control. Carmine calls up on the telephone -- calls the bank -- and he sees that the Sheik is real and he has a real account. Five days. \nSTODDARD THORSEN I'm not taking two million dollars of the taxpayers' money and putting it anywhere for five days, I don't care if we control it the whole time. \nRichie as he stares at Stoddard in frustration. \nRICHIE DIMASO Stoddard, let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are ruining this country. That's my dream. Don't smother it, please. \nSTODDARD THORSEN You know Richard, I understand your eagerness. I really do. You know I'm from Michigan, right? Let me tell you a story about me, and my dad, and my brother. We used to go ice fishing every November. Ice Fishing. That's what we lived for. \nRICHIE DIMASO Holy shit -- \nSTODDARD THORSEN Just listen to me. It's beautiful. You have a little stove. You huddle around, you keep each other warm. You drop a line and you just wait. One year my brother says, \"let's go in October.\" He wants to go ice fishing in October.

For now, no Carmine Polito. Go do your job. \nRichie looks at him annoyed and upset. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) Stoddard shot the whole thing down. \nRICHIE DIMASO Boring. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

(CONT'D) She somehow found this woman who controlled the wire room. A woman I'd never heard of. Way back in a warren buried in the Bureau. This cat lady nobody even talked to. Edith met her in the ladies room and became friends with her. This lady handled all the wires and now, she was working with us. \nSMASH TO: \n85   Edith and Richie enter to find BRENDA, FBI, MATRONLY, OLDER;   85 EDITH carries a basket of exotic teas; \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D) She was excited to be included in an operation instead of being on the other end of a memo. It was beautiful. \nEdith goes to hand her the PIMMS CUP and basket of teas. \nEDITH GREENSLY Brenda, hi! \nBRENDA MCPHERSON Hi! \nEDITH GREENSLY You said you liked exotic food, so that's from England. \nBRENDA MCPHERSON That's from England? \nEDITH GREENSLY That's right. And I brought you some tea as well. \nBRENDA MCPHERSON Thank you so much! Nobody ever tells me about these operations, they just say, \"Brenda, do the clerical wiring work and don't ask questions.\" \nEDITH GREENSLY You need to tell Richie about your cats. He loves them. \nBRENDA MCPHERSON Oh my cats?! \nBrenda starts pointing out pictures of all her cats tacked to the walls amidst the wire memos and paperwork. \nBRENDA MCPHERSON (CONT'D) Well that's Harry -- look at him standing up, isn't that sweet? And that's Wendy. She's a rascal. But Barnaby, that's another story. Barnaby plays the piano! \nRICHIE DIMASO That's impressive. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

That was very smart. The Sheik with the money in the bank is a fantastic...don't be modest. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) Anthony Amado. He was the U.S. Attorney, and he had a major hard- on to make a name for himself. I mean this guy loved the idea of being famous. And Stoddard had to say it was his own idea or he'd look stupid in front of his boss. \nINT.

ANOTHER ROOM OF SHERMAN SUITE - CONTINUOUS                 160 \nShe watches Irving who is pacing anxiously and very wound up. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (pacing) I want to save us. I want to save Carmine. It's fucking killing me. \nSYDNEY PROSSER You know the only way to help Carmine is through the Tellegio thing. \nIRVING ROSENFELD It's dangerous. We gotta get a wire in there. We gotta make him feel safe. \nSYDNEY PROSSER There's only one thing that can really fuck this up and that's your wife. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (pacing) Yep. \n161   EXT. DANNY'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- DAY                           161 \nRosalyn fixes Danny's coat, hands him his lunch and sends him off towards the school's front door -- \nCLOSE UP: ROSALYN STARES INTO LENS. Emotional, a mixture of sadness and hope. She holds a closed bottle of her favorite nail finish and smells it nostalgically. \nA BLACK SEDAN PULLS INTO THE FRAME, SHE OPENS THE DOOR AND GETS IN. IT IS PETE MUSANE, TELLEGIO'S MOBSTER SHE FLIRTED WITH AT THE CASINO. \n162   INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - DAY                               162 \nHe gently puts a hand on her knee.

MAISON D'LUC - HUNTINGTON, LONG ISLAND - DAY               163 \nA NICE RESTAURANT OVERLOOKING THE LONG ISLAND SOUND, LIGHT CORAL COLORED TABLECLOTHS; THE PLACE FILLED WITH DAYLIGHT -- ROSALYN AND PETE SIT VERY CLOSE. QUIET. TOGETHER. IN SILENCE. FEW BEATS. CONTENT. \nPETE MUSANE I don't like your husband. You're no good together. He doesn't appreciate you. Hey, it happens. It happened in my marriage. That's why I went to Miami. Sometimes you just gotta be tough. You gotta stand up and you gotta leave, you know? \nRosalyn looks at Pete smitten. \nPETE MUSANE (CONT'D) Sometimes you gotta let something die to let something live. You're too beautiful to be unhappy. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I know. I mean, I don't want to badmouth my husband, but let me badmouth my husband for a second. He just thinks that he knows everything and he's so full of shit. He's such a liar. He thinks that I'm stupid, but I'm not stupid. I hear him on the phone arguing. He loves Carmine, but he hates that other guy, that curly- headed I.R.S. guy, or whatever who's carting around my husband's ex-lover, that redheaded whore. \nPETE MUSANE IRS? \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Anyway. You can see that it drives him crazy. \n", "test3_id": 1085}

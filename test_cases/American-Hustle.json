{"train": "AMERICAN HUSTLE \nWritten by \nEric Warren Singer and David O. Russell \nTITLE CARD: SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED \nOVER BLACK: APRIL 26, 1978, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK \n1   FADE IN: \n2   INT. PLAZA HOTEL WINDOW NYC - DAY \nIRVING ROSENFELD, not a small man, gets dressed and meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND, see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing himself before a performance. \nIrving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to another room. \n3   SECOND PLAZA HOTEL ROOM \nIrving composes himself -- looks into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit, pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie shady businessman. \nHe exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER (who will also be known for some time as EDITH GREENSLY), stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely -- they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands there. \nRICHIE DIMASO What are you doing, going behind my back? Telling people I'm screwing up this operation? I got you a suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel! \nIRVING ROSENFELD The shittiest suite at the Plaza Hotel. \nRICHIE DIMASO \nWhat?! \nIRV ROSENFELD The shittiest fuckin' suite. \nRICHIE DIMASO Based on what--? \nIRVING ROSENFELD \nAnd the food is wrong, and--What is this? You, like, went in my closet or something? \nEDITH GREENSLY No \nIRVING ROSENFELD Are you dressing him like you're dressing me now? \nEDITH GREENSLY (shakes her head) No, what are you thinking? This isn't all about you, you know that. \nRICHIE DIMASO What, did you try to dress me so I would look like him? \nEDITH GREENSLY No, you're not dressed like him, all right? \nRICHIE DIMASO But I do, I look like him. \nEDITH GREENSLY No, he's in like, velvet. Come on. \nIRVING ROSENFELD You asked me to show you how this was done, you wanna fuck it up be my guest. \nEDITH GREENSLY What is your problem? \nRICHIE DIMASO Hey, look, I never laid a hand on her, all right? Is that what this is about? \nEDITH GREENSLY (British accent) Well technically, that's not true. \nRICHIE DIMASO Look, we never had sex ok? I just -- \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) What'd I do? I put my hand like this -- \nRichie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very carefully, not forcefully. \nIrving swipes it away violently the second it touches his face. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Don't you fucking touch me. That bothers me -- \nRICHIE DIMASO Oh it does? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Oh yeah. \nRICHIE DIMASO That bothers you? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Yes. \nRICHIE DIMASO You know, a lot of shit bothers me too, but I was trying to help you. If I wanted to bother you, if I really wanted to fucking bother you, this is what I'd do. \nRichie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent so much time creating. Irving just stands there, hair ruined, staring at Richie. \nIRVING ROSENFELD You shouldn't have done that. \nIrving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and messed up looking very angry. \nRICHIE DIMASO How's that? You bothered now? (no answer) Alright, don't make a thing of it. \nEDITH GREENSLY You shouldn't touch him. He doesn't like that. \nRICHIE DIMASO Oh my god, fix his hair. Don't make a thing of it. \nEDITH GREENSLY It takes some time, ok. \nEdith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in silence with his hair all over the place. She carefully starts helping him put it back together. \nRICHIE DIMASO Big fucking deal. We got to get in the other room, come on. The mayor's in there. \nEDITH GREENSLY Yes I know that. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Did you ever have to find a way to survive and you knew your choices were bad? \nIrving walks over and hits the elevator button again. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I learned how to survive when I was a kid. \n7                                                         CUT TO:    7 \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) (CONT'D) My father had a glass business. \n28   IRV AS KID SMASHES PLATE GLASS WINDOWS OF BRONX STOREFRONTS     28 \nDrumming up business for his father. \nEXT. ROSENFELD & SON GLASS REPAIR CO. - DAY 1940'S \nYoung Irving and his Father and Mother standing outside the family's glass repair shop in the Bronx as some tough contractors march up to them. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) I would rather be on the taking side than the getting taken side any day of the week, especially after I saw how my father got taken. I mean, seeing that scarred me for life. \nEXT. UNDISCLOSED STREET - DAY 1940'S \nYoung Irving runs by a store front as he throws a rock through each window on the store, smashing them all. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) (CONT'D) I took it upon myself to drum up business. I became a different kind of guy than my father. I became a con artist -- from the feet up, for real. \nCUT TO: \nTHE BRONX: STOREFRONT WITH SMASHED WINDOW. - DAY - PRESENT \nIrv shakes his head, surveys the damage. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I was gonna survive no matter what. I still had the glass business and a few dry cleaning stores on the side. \n7G   INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - DAY                                   7G \nIrving paces around his office smoking a cigar and talking on the phone. What looks to be stolen art sits on the floor all around him. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) And I did some art dealing on the side. Stolen or forged art. \nEXT./INT. POOL PARTY - LONG ISLAND HOUSE - DAY \nChicago's \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\" fades up. Jamming early 70s HOLIDAY party -- LONG ISLAND LADIES IN BIKINIS WITH HUGE HAIR IN FUR COATS SMOKING OUTSIDE THE GLASS ENCLOSED POOL -while inside steamed glass SHINY BIKINI CANDIDATES FOR NOSE JOBS; A FEW OTHERS WHO ARE LARGE, SEVERAL GUYS WHO LOOK MOBBED UP, pale, out of shape, gold chains, in swim trunks, EVEN MORE BURT REYNOLDS TYPE GUYS, slim, hairy, chains. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) So, one January I go to my friends pool party in Long Island. \nIrving sits holding court with some friends by the pool when he turns and sees Sydney for the first time. \nPUSH IN ON: Irving. He looks up, they lock eyes across the party. \nSYD REACHES FOR A SLICE OF FRUIT ON HIGH SET PLATE WHEN IRVING'S HAND GRABS HER ARM -- she turns, taken aback - \nIRVING ROSENFELD Is that Duke Ellington on your bracelet? \nShe does have on a Duke Ellington charm bracelet. \nSYDNEY PROSSER As a matter of fact, it is. He died this year, you know. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I know. I doubt anyone else here knows or cares about it. \nSYDNEY PROSSER Well I care. He saved my life many times. \nIrving takes a good look at her, impressed. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (impressed) Mine too. Which one? \nSYDNEY PROSSER Jeep's Blues. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (smiles, warm) Jeep's Blues. Oh yeah. \nAwkward pause. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) You wanna hear it? \nSYDNEY PROSSER Right now? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Yeah. \nSYDNEY PROSSER Sure. \nCUT TO: PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER PLAYS START OF JEEP'S BLUES as Irving and Sydney nod to it - he watches her foot in her high wedge and her tanned leg rocking as she sits on arm of sofa. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Who starts a song like that?! \nSYDNEY PROSSER It's magic. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Magic. \nThey listen to the record, Edith checks Irving out. \nSYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He wasn't necessarily in good shape, and he had this comb-over that was rather -- elaborate. He had this air about him. And he had this confidence that drew me to him. He was who he was and he didn't care. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Like me, she was a very particular person. Like me, she came from a place where her options were limited -- and she had been someone she didn't want to be in her past. \nCUT TO -- SYDNEY DANCES IN A SMALL TOWN, OLD FASHIONED STRIP BAR. \nSYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) It actually can feel kind of sexy sometimes. There's a boldness in it. But where would that boldness take me? I didn't know. But I was gonna find out. \n8   CUT TO:                                                         8 \nSYDNEY WALKS DOWN A BLEAK INDUSTRIAL STREET. \nIrv and Edith dance through the lobby. \n49   THE PIERRE HOTEL CAFE                                           49 \nAs they dance among mostly older wealthy couples on the small dance floor of the elegant restaurant as a live jazz quartet plays \"I've Got Your Number\". Camera circles them, putting their foreheads together, very happy. THEY SING TO EACH OTHER quietly as they dance close. \n50   INT. ROOM AT PIERRE HOTEL -- NIGHT                              50 \nIrv and Edith make passionate love, we see in pieces -- \nHe gets up, she watches him dress and leave -- \n52   INT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                     52 \n53   He drives over the Triborough Bridge.                           53 \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) As, as far as I could see, people were always conning each other to get what they wanted. We even con ourselves. \n54   INT./EXT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                54 \n55   He drives through the suburb of ranch houses and driveways      55 \n56   and pulls into his driveway of his split-level ranch. Irv       56 gets out of his Cadillac and walks to the front door of his house -- \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) We talk ourselves into things. We sell ourselves things we maybe don't even need or want by dressing them up. We leave out the risk. We leave out the ugly truth. \n57   INT. IRV'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        57 \nIrv walks into the decorated ranch house, frosted glass with bird designs, glass tables, walls, black and brown lacquer everywhere. He walks into the house and looks at a picture his son did -- a drawing of the Yankees playing baseball -- that is taped to the refrigerator. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Pay attention to that because we're all conning ourselves in one way or another just to get through life. \nIrv takes Danny's picture from the fridge and tip toes -- with low sounds now of O.S. TV -- Irv goes to A CLOSED DOOR WITH YANKEE STICKERS on it -- \nIrv OPENS A BEDROOM DOOR TO REVEAL HIS 5 YEAR OLD SON, DANNY. \nSYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He was married, and he had a son. \n58   INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       58 \nDANNY is on the bed, picture books, baseball cards, spread all around him. Irv stands holding the picture. Danny looks over his shoulder. \nSYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He had adopted her son. \nDANNY DADDY! \nSYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He was a really good dad and I respected him for that. It was a tough situation for everyone. \nIrv's face lights up. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Danny. This is a fantastic picture. What did you do today? \nDANNY That kid Donovan is being mean to me. \nIRVING ROSENFELD The big kid? I thought Mommy picked you up so he couldn't bother you. \nDANNY She was late, and then after we put out the fire, mommy said stay in my room with my baseball cards. \nDanny reaches across to Irving and takes his glasses off his face and puts them on. \nIRVING ROSENFELD What fire? \nDANNY Did you know they make a lamp that has the sun in it? [Irv looks at him] Mommy got the lamp. She made her special drink and the lamp made a fire. \nIrv looks concerned. \n59   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    59 \nIrv's wife Rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu, half her face is burned. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I put out the fire. The fire is out. \nIRVING ROSENFELD For the first time in my life I do the right thing. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Oh shut up -- \nIRVING ROSENFELD I save a young single mother, and her kid. I marry her. I adopt him - \nROSALYN ROSENFELD You fell in love! Don't forget we fell madly in love! \nIRVING ROSENFELD Yes, I fell in love. My God, I fell in love. Yes. But you know what? I thought you were mysterious like my mother until it turned out that mysterious just meant depressed, hard to reach. I mean, I'm dying here! And you need somebody who's gonna be quiet like you. You're young, you're beautiful. You gotta find somebody else. You gotta go out and get some friends all right? Don't sit inside -- \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I don't like going out. You know that I get anxiety when I have to meet people. You know how hard that is. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Yeah but you can't just stay in the house with the fucking sun lamp. Alright? And I can't-- I mean, look, I can't trust you with it anyway. That fire and everything. I can't trust to leave you with Danny. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I put the fire out Irving! There is no fire! Maybe if you were here more, then there wouldn't have been a fire in the first place. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Oh, what, there wouldn't have been a fire if I was here? \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Just stop with the whole fire thing. God it was a mistake. I'm sure a million people do that all the time. Those sun lamps are dangerous. Shouldn't even have them in the house, really. I bet that happens all the time. This was nothing. \nIRVING ROSENFELD We're not happy. Alright? \nRosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying nothing. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD You know that I could take Danny. You know that most of your work is illegal. And you know that if you tried to divorce me, you know that-- I'm not saying that I would, but I'm saying that I could. And I'm saying that that is why I don't like divorce, Irving. Women do that in divorces. Women get the children, and then the fathers never see them. My mother never got divorced. My grandmother never got divorced. There are NO divorces in my family. I am not getting a divorce. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Come on. What are we doing here? \nROSALYN ROSENFELD We fight and we fuck and that's what we do. That's our thing. \nMORT/RICHIE REPEATEDLY TRIES TO HAND IT TO IRV, WHO IS BUSY STARING AT SYDNEY STARING AT MORT. MORT HOLDS THE CHECK IN THE AIR UNCOMFORTABLY AWKWARDLY UNTIL -- almost in slow motion --Edith takes the check -- staring at Mort. IRV STARTS TO LEAVE - \nMORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) Zurich? You got an office in Zurich? Paris? I can call Paris? \nIRVING ROSENFELD If you could excuse me for one second? \nMORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO Yeah, take your time. Do whatever you need to do. Go ahead, take your time. \nHE HEADS TO THE REAR EXIT WHILE SYD MOVES TO ANOTHER -- IRV OPENS THE DOOR - BAM -- A WARRANT IS HELD UP TO HIS FACE BY STOCKY FBI AGENT SCHMIDT IN A SUIT - HE WALKS IRV BACK INTO THE OFFICE -- \nAS Edith OPENS A SIDE DOOR -- BANG - FEDERAL AGENT STOCK WALKS HER BACK INTO THE OFFICE WITH A WARRANT. \nIRVING ROSENFELD You got the wrong office, you're gonna be embarrassed. \nTHE AGENTS START PUTTING EDITH IN CUFFS IMMEDIATELY. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) HEY, HEY, HEY! GO EASY ON HER. \nMORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO I may not have you, Irving, but I have her on fraud. Impersonating another individual. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Fraud?! Fraud? What is that? Identity fraud? \nAGENTS SCHMIDT AND STOCK IMMEDIATELY START TAKING BOXES OF FILES FROM DRAWERS, IMPOUNDING EVIDENCE. \nMORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO You may be from England, Edith, but you're not royal and you have no banking connections and that's a felony. How long is that? That's 3- 5 years I think. \nEDITH GREENSLY (about the handcuffs) Hey! Not so tight! \nIRVING ROSENFELD Oh really? That's interesting. I don't even know your real name. \nRichie pulls out a badge and shoves it in Irving's face. \nRICHIE DIMASO Richie Dimaso, FBI. Nice to meet you. \nRichie looks at Edith with concern and points at Irving. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) You gotta get away from this guy. \nAgents take boxes of files out of the office- Irv standing alone in center of room- shell-shocked. \n64   INT. FBI HOLDING OFFICES - DAY.                                  64 \nSYDNEY IS LED INTO A HOLDING CELL BY AN FBI AGENT. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) He wouldn't let me see her for three days. He even managed to delay a lawyer. \nINT. FBI HOLDING CELL - DAY \nDim cell, lit only from small high barred window, no lights on. Edith looks like she's coming apart -- circles under her eyes, a shadow of her confident self -- pale, scared, hair flat, stringy, unglamourous, pacing, rocking. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) 65             She couldn't handle it.                               65 \n66   INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - NIGHT                                   66 \nFLUORESCENT LIGHTS COME ON IN THE CELL -- Edith squints. Cell is unlocked by Richie Dimaso WHO enters with a cup and saucer of tea. He stands near her with the tea. \nRICHIE DIMASO (to the other side of the two-way mirror) Joe, how come the fluorescents are on? Can we kill that, please? (to Syd) Jesus I put this lamp here for you 'cause I thought it'd be better for you. There's a wire here. They're scared because people hang themselves but I know you're too smart for that. Where's the table and chair? There's no bed here? It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is everybody off today? Jesus Christ it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare you. I don't know. Maybe it was my idea. Maybe i'm a little off the beaten path you know? I don't know. You look dehydrated. Here, want to try some tea? Oh yeah, your lips are all chapped. (re: tea) It's herbal. My favorite. \nRichie bends down to Edith who is sitting on the floor in the corner and hands her the cup and saucer. She lifts the cup but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the cup to her lips. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I know you think -- look at me. Hey. Edith. (MORE) \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I know you think Irv loves you. I know you think you know him -- that he sees the world as a cold, dark place, and he cares about nobody but very few people on his short list: his son, his father, Rosalyn, and you. And you think you're at the top of that list. But what if you're not. What if you're not even on the list at all? He'd be in here right now if he took the check. \nShe thinks about this. She trembles. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) He'd be in here right now if he took the check. But no, you did. God, it's, it's so clear to me. It's so crazy -- it's clear to me, but it's not clear to you. He uses you, Edith, to protect himself. To protect his son and his wife in Long Island. No? Yes. He put a ring on her finger, he adopted her son. They have huge house, they have two cars. What does she do all day? I'll tell you what she does -- she plays with her nails, she watches T.V., and she spends your money, the money that you make. \nEdith stares at Richie, taking this in. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I don't like that you're in jail while he's going free. I don't like any of that. I want to help you. All the razzle-dazzle that he does, it's not good. It's not real. It's fake. It's not real. Who you are is who you are, between you and God. You and your soul. That's what matters. That's what counts. That's what I'm about. And that's what I see in you. Tell me you didn't feel it the first time we saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't think so. I'm not supposed to be talking like this, but I don't care, I break the rules. \nEdith looks at Richie in silence as she thinks about what he's saying. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help you. I like you. (whispers) I like you. (dead serious) I like you. \n67   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY            67 \nIrv stands alone on the other side of the glass staring at Sydney. \nRichard Dimaso walks in. \nRICHIE DIMASO Been in there three days. Hasn't been so good for her. \nIrv continues to stare at Sydney. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) How does that make you feel her in there? That check was for you, right? But you knew somethin' was off. That's 'cause you're good. You're, like, the best at what you do in the whole country, aren't you? \nIrv looks at him. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) But you know what? If the country were run by people like you, Irving Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern Europe or Guatemala. You ever been in Guatemala? You ever been in jail in Guatemala? You ever try to get a telephone or a permit or anything in Guatemala? That's what this country would be like if we let people, let the liars like you, run this country. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Who made you god and judge? \nRICHIE DIMASO My grandmother lived to be ninety- three years old. Never lied in her life. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Congratulations. \nRICHIE DIMASO Thank you. I'm proud of that, too. Does that make her not a good person? Is that not something to strive for? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Why you breaking my balls? Get to the point. \nRichie stares at Edith elated that she just stuck up for him. He's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him in. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (stares at her, upset) OK, to set this up and bust a con artist we have to make the honey pot to attract the bees. In order to attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of, someone special, someone new, someone amazing. Then those guys will want to sell fake bank CDS to THAT guy, take the sheik's money, see? \nRichie looks at Irving uncertain. \nSYDNEY PROSSER Only they can't get into his money unless you they know someone, and that someone is us. \nRICHIE DIMASO Oh that's good. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) So if you want to get somebody like your con artist friend -- Carl Elway -- you get him to want to buy- \nIRVING ROSENFELD Keep your voice down. \nRICHIE DIMASO -- or sell fake art or stolen art or fake certificates of deposit, he needs -- who does he need? -- he needs a rich sheik guy, and there you go -- we can pinch him! \nIRVING ROSENFELD Right, but I don't tell Elway shit. I wait for him to call me. The art world is a small world -- and one of Elway's acquaintances is clocking us right now. \nRichie starts to look around. \nRICHIE DIMASO Where? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Don't look. \nRichie looks anyway and sees ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE, a man balding, 45 clocking them from the balcony. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) You have a good look? \nRICHIE DIMASO How do you know the Sheik? \nIRVING ROSENFELD This is my friend Al from Queens. \nAL FROM QUEENS/SHEIK I do aluminum siding and roofing. \nRichie stares, impressed. \nINT. ART MUSEUM - NEXT ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nIrving, Edith, Richie, and the fake Sheik admire a REMBRANDT painting on the wall. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I want to show you something. This Rembrandt here? People come from all over the world to see this. \nRICHIE DIMASO Yeah, he's good. \nIRVING ROSENFELD It's a fake. \nRICHIE DIMASO Wait, what're you talking about? That's impossible. \nIRVING ROSENFELD People believe what they want to believe. Cause the guy who made this was so good that it's real to everybody. Now whose the master -- the painter or the forger? \nRichie's continues to stare at the REMBRANDT on the wall. \nRICHIE DIMASO That's a fake? \nIRVING ROSENFELD That's the way the world works. Not black and white as you say. Extremely grey. \nELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE walks up to Irving and the group and steps into the conversation. \nELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE Irving can I -- \nIRVING ROSENFELD How many times I gotta tell you. You can't meet the sheik, alright? \nEdith sees this and steps into the conversation. \nEDITH GREENSLY Arthur? Hi. Edith. We've met before. \nEDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D) I wanted to introduce you to Robert Spencer. We're advising the Sheik together. \nShe looks at Richie. Richie offers his hand. \nRICHIE DIMASO (catching up) Yeah, I'm Robert Spencer, advisor to the sheik. \n70A   EXT. CHELSEA HOTEL -- ESTABLISHING - DAY                        70A \n71    INT. OFFICE OF CARL ELWAY - SUCCESSFUL, BUT SHADY - DAY         71 \nCARL ELWAY, 40, preppie Waspy, very old fashioned with cigarette holder, but something vaguely criminal about him, in his conservative suit, natty white and red striped shirt, and navy blue tie sits with Irving. \nCARL ELWAY What's this I hear about a god damn Sheik?! Why you leaving me out of this? I gotta hear about it from my friends? \nIRVING ROSENFELD It ain't for you Carl. \nCARL ELWAY What do you mean it ain't for me? We gotta do certificates of deposit. I can print as many as you need. \nIRVING ROSENFELD This is not a one man operation. \nCARL ELWAY Look, I can get other guys. What are you talking about Irving? \nIRVING ROSENFELD You're telling me that you can get four guys to sell fake certificates of deposit to my investor within a week? \nThe camera zooms into Irving's shirt collar revealing a tiny microphone. \nCARL ELWAY Yes I can make that happen. Carl Elway can do what he says he's going to do. \nIRVING ROSENFELD That's interesting but you know I've got other guys lined up. I've got a meeting with my associates. \nSUDDENLY CARL ELWAY'S ASSISTANT, OPENS THE DOOR AND ENTERS. Richie Dimaso and Edith ARE STANDING THERE -- MUCH TO IRV'S DISMAY. \nCARL ELWAY'S ASSISTANT Carl, his associates are here. He's got a meeting he's got to go to. \nCARL ELWAY No wait. Don't go anywhere. \nRICHIE DIMASO I understand what's happening. You're saying your brother went out on the ice, the ice was too thin, he fell through the ice, he went in the water because he was too eager, and you're saying I'm too eager -- that's what you're saying? \nSTODDARD THORSEN No, that's not what I'm saying. \nRICHIE DIMASO What are you saying? \nSTODDARD THORSEN We'll finish the ice fishing story another time, young man. For now, no Carmine Polito. Go do your job. \nRichie looks at him annoyed and upset. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) Stoddard shot the whole thing down. \nRICHIE DIMASO Boring. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D) But Edith was a genius. \n83   SEE B-ROLL OF: Edith and Richie walk back into FBI building,   83 \n84   down corridor;                                                 84 \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D) She somehow found this woman who controlled the wire room. A woman I'd never heard of. Way back in a warren buried in the Bureau. This cat lady nobody even talked to. Edith met her in the ladies room and became friends with her. This lady handled all the wires and now, she was working with us. \nSMASH TO: \n85   Edith and Richie enter to find BRENDA, FBI, MATRONLY, OLDER;   85 EDITH carries a basket of exotic teas; \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D) She was excited to be included in an operation instead of being on the other end of a memo. It was beautiful. \nEdith goes to hand her the PIMMS CUP and basket of teas. \nEDITH GREENSLY Brenda, hi! \nBRENDA MCPHERSON Hi! \nEDITH GREENSLY You said you liked exotic food, so that's from England. \nBRENDA MCPHERSON That's from England? \nEDITH GREENSLY That's right. And I brought you some tea as well. \nBRENDA MCPHERSON Thank you so much! Nobody ever tells me about these operations, they just say, \"Brenda, do the clerical wiring work and don't ask questions.\" \nEDITH GREENSLY You need to tell Richie about your cats. He loves them. \nBRENDA MCPHERSON Oh my cats?! \nBrenda starts pointing out pictures of all her cats tacked to the walls amidst the wire memos and paperwork. \nBRENDA MCPHERSON (CONT'D) Well that's Harry -- look at him standing up, isn't that sweet? And that's Wendy. She's a rascal. But Barnaby, that's another story. Barnaby plays the piano! \nRICHIE DIMASO That's impressive. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D) We got her to wire two million dollars into an F.B.I.-controlled account at Chase. It'd be there for five days and if Polito called he'd see that the Sheik was real. \n86   HALLWAY OF FBI                                                86 \nEdith and Richie laugh excitedly as they walk the hallways. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D) By the time Stoddard caught up to us Edith made sure his boss was impressed by my idea. So before he even knew it was happening his boss was calling to congratulate him. \nPUSH IN ON CHIEF US PROSECUTOR, SPECIAL TASK FORCE, ANTHONY AMADO IN HIS LARGE OFFICE ON THE PHONE WITH STODDARD -- \nANTHONY AMADO I'm very impressed. That was very smart. The Sheik with the money in the bank is a fantastic...don't be modest. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) Anthony Amado. He was the U.S. Attorney, and he had a major hard- on to make a name for himself. I mean this guy loved the idea of being famous. And Stoddard had to say it was his own idea or he'd look stupid in front of his boss. \nINT. STODDARD'S OFFICE -- \n89   PUSH IN ON STODDARD -- confused, dismayed.                    89 \nSTODDARD THORSEN Thank you, sir, wait, the sheik -- \nINT. STODDARD'S OFFICE - DAY \nHe hangs up, pissed, confused. \nSTODDARD THORSEN You made me accept praise from my boss who's thanking me for something that never shoulda happened! Something that I didn't approve! \nRICHIE DIMASO You should be happy. There's imaginative things happening in this office, alright? We're not just working in a box. \nRichie leaves triumphant. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D) We got the two million to put Carmine and the Sheik together. \nSTODDARD THORSEN Punk. \n90   INT. CORRIDOR OF FBI -- DAY                                      90 \nLaughing Richie and Edith walk briskly on their way out. \nRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) I liked being on this side of the line. But someone had been left out. \n91   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                    91 \nIRVING ROSENFELD We succeeded because we stayed small. I got you Carl Elway. He bought stolen art, sold fake bank C.D.'s, that's enough. That's one. I get you three more -- no politicians. \nRichie and Edith look at him. \nRICHIE DIMASO You're gonna do this because you got no choice. You work for me. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Now you keep changing the rules. You're gettin' a little power drunk, Richard. (MORE) \nCARMINE POLITO The spicy clams. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Yes. They're always good. \nCARMINE POLITO Oh, they're to fucking die for, those clams. I haven't been there in a while. I like that place. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Carmine -- can I call you Carmine? You know, Carmine -- (catches his breath) My fuckin' heart's going from running down the stairs -- I'm not used to running. There's a lotta green grass in that hotel room up there, alright? And all the deals would float through you. You get a serious piece on both ends. You do with that what you will. I live in the real world, I am a family man, I got mouths to feed and everything. But, you know, we just...we gotta grease you directly. No middlemen, no bullshit. It's the Arab way. \nCARMINE POLITO Yeah, look, I understand. It's a great opportunity. It's just I got a little thrown by going to have a meeting with somebody who ended up not being there, so -- \nIRVING ROSENFELD Hey, listen, I was thrown as well. \nCARMINE POLITO I understand. I'll deal with you directly. I don't want any middleman or any of that bullshit. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Done. \nCARMINE POLITO I like you. Eye to eye. We can do business together. \nIrv smiles and nods as they walk back into the hotel together. \nCARMINE POLITO (CONT'D) How long do you know this guy? You work with this guy before? \nIRVING ROSENFELD I gotta work with him. He's the Sheik's man. \nCARMINE POLITO But I still need to meet the Sheik, okay? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Done. \n94   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                94 \nIRVING ROSENFELD I'm going out to dinner with Carmine and the wives in Camden. \nRICHIE DIMASO Who? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Carmine and myself and the wives. \nRICHIE DIMASO What?! Without me?! \nIRVING ROSENFELD He doesn't like you, what do you want from me, I got him to come back and take the money and you got him on tape alright? I can't make him like you. I did my job. \nRICHIE DIMASO Did you tell him you were working with me? That I'm the Sheik's associate?! \nIRVING ROSENFELD I just fucking told you he doesn't like you. I mean, let him have a night out with a human being for fuck's sake, he's going to jail soon. You're done with him. You got him on tape taking a bribe. \nRICHIE DIMASO Carmine has got to deal with me, Irving. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) We're gonna use Carmine. We're gonna use Carmine to get other people, that's what we're gonna do. \nIRVING ROSENFELD What?! Like who?! \nRICHIE DIMASO Carmine's gonna use the Sheik to pay off people. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Are you fuckin' nuts? What are you say-- \nRICHIE DIMASO We're gonna let Carmine show the Sheik Atlantic City, how he's gonna renovate hotels, and see who shows up. Whoever the Sheik pays off for licenses and casinos, that's who we're gonna go after. We're gonna go after all of 'em! \nIRVING ROSENFELD More politicians? You realize how fuckin' dangerous that is? There's no fucking reasoning with you. (MORE) \nIRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) Edith and I were so successful for so long because we kept it just small enough. You are takin' us to a very fucking dangerous place, with very serious numbers! \nRICHIE DIMASO If your that successful, how come you wound up in this room with me? Taking orders from me. \nEDITH GREENSLY You're taking your wife out to dinner? Your fucking wife? Did I just hear you correctly? \nIRVING ROSENFELD That's the one thing you heard me say? \nEDITH GREENSLY I just find it rather shocking that's all. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I get to handle two wives with one dinner, alright? I take Rosalyn out, she keeps her mouth shut, she sees that my work is legitimate, I get to keep my kid, and I get to keep (pointing at Richie) that fucking wife happy. Both wives happy. \nINT.

It's a problem. \nRICHIE DIMASO See, your job is to do the filter, Mom, mine is to do the gravel. When you don't do the filter right all the fish die. See? \nRICHIE'S MOTHER I can't get the top on that filter. \nRICHIE DIMASO I've gone over this a hundred times mom -- \nCUT TO: \nRICHIE, HIS GIRLFRIEND, AND MOTHER ALL SIT AT THE TABLE WITH FOOD INFRONT OF THEM AS THEY START TO PRAY. \nRICHIE'S MOTHER -- and please help Richard to marry Diane so that I may have grandchildren and the Pope may have more followers. And please bless this food that we are about to eat - \nIRVING ROSENFELD Didn't Jesus say that or something? \nCARMINE POLITO He may have. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Also, always take a favor over money. I think Jesus said that as well. \nCARMINE POLITO (laughing) I don't know if he said the second one but he may have said the first one. \nCUT TO -- Rosalyn DRUNKENLY LEANS IN TALKING TO Dolly POLITO \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (shows her nails) I chip them moving furniture, it's my obsession -- Moving, re- decorating, it makes me feel better like exercise. There's this top coat that you can only get from Switzerland and I don't know what I'm going to do because I'm running out of it but I LOVE the smell of it. \nDOLLY POLITO I can get that for you, of course. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD There's something, the topcoat, (sniffs nails) it's like perfumey but there's also something rotten? I know that sounds crazy, but I can't get enough of it. \nDolly laughs. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D) No, smell it. It's true. Dolly, historically the best perfumes in the world, they're all laced with something nasty and foul. It's true! \nShe puts it under Irv's nose as he talks to Carmine, he sniffs, closes his eyes, nods without even looking. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D) Irving loves them. He can't get enough of them. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I can't get enough. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (hand out to Carmine) Carmine, sweet and sour. Rotten and delicious. \nShe leans across the table and puts them under Carmine's nose. \nCARMINE POLITO Smells like flowers. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Flowers, but with garbage. \nCARMINE POLITO You know what that is for me? It's coriander for me. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Irving loves it. He can't get enough. That's what hooks you. He always comes back for it. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I can't stop. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (confidentially to Dolly) He's gonna say we have to talk business in five, four, three, two, one -- \nIRVING ROSENFELD (to girls) Dolly, can me and the mayor talk business here? \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (falling off her seat) AHH-HA-HAHAAAAAAAAHHHHH! \nCarmine and Dolly rush to grab Rosalyn; JULIUS, Carmine's steadfast AIDE, BLACK, 40, BIG SIDEBURNS, LOOSENED TIE and white shirtsleeves, BIG SMILE, helps. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D) No, don't do that it makes me look more drunk than I am!

I was just teasing you. \nRICHIE DIMASO Do you ever think, how did I end up here? How did my life become this? You ever think that? And you wonder, am I ever gonna get to a better place or is this it? You ever feel like that? \nEdith stares, nods yes. \nEDITH GREENSLY I do. I definitely know that. \nEdith nods puts a hand on his face. \nEDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D) I'm sorry we don't have to go dancing.

Alright? \nShe get's real close to his face, almost about to kiss. \nEDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D) We're going to wait until we decide to go for love Richie. For real. That's when we fuck. Not till then, ok? \nRICHIE DIMASO OK. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Really? \nCARMINE POLITO It's science, yeah. That's how it heats up the food. It's scientific. \nIRVING ROSENFELD And you specifically bought this science oven for me. \nCARMINE POLITO (Carmine stares meaningfully at Irv) Yes. A new friend. \nIrv is touched. He sees it is a sincere gift from Carmine, because Carmine likes him; not cynical in any way. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Thank you. \nCARMINE POLITO Don't put metal in it.

FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY            109 \nRICHIE DIMASO I need a jet at Teeterboro for the sheik. \nSTODDARD THORSEN You don't need a jet. Let him walk to the curb at JFK. \nRICHIE DIMASO Stoddard, that's not how it works. You got to do it from the feet up. \nSTODDARD THORSEN That doesn't mean anything. What's that mean? \nRICHIE DIMASO It means you gotta be committed! It means you gotta be committed to something in your life, for Christ's sake. I want a jet at Teterboro for the Sheik. It can be a small jet. It doesn't even have to take off, cause I know you're so worried about how much money the Bureau's gonna fucking spend. It can take off and land on the tarmac, okay? \nSTODDARD THORSEN Alright, you can have a jet for an hour, but it takes off and lands at Teterboro. \nRICHIE DIMASO I got the jet? \nSTODDARD THORSEN You got the jet. \nRICHIE DIMASO 110             Thank you.                                            110 \nRichie goes to walk out of Stoddard's office but stops at the door. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) So tell me the rest of the ice fishing story. \nSTODDARD THORSEN Where was I? \nRICHIE DIMASO Your father woke you up, it was a blizzard, it was Lake Canoga. Come on! \nSTODDARD THORSEN Okay, well, my brother and I were on the ice and my father came out of the house and I could see him coming. He was holding a lantern, and it was in the blizzard and I knew he was gonna be angry. So I went to intercept my father because I knew if he saw what my brother was doing he was going to kill him. \nRichie cuts him off. \nRICHIE DIMASO So you tried to protect your brother, but you couldn't and that's why you feel bad, because you're trying to protect me and you're worried about me. Is that what the story's about? About protection? \nSTODDARD THORSEN No, it's not about protection. \nRICHIE DIMASO It's not about protection? \nSTODDARD THORSEN No. \nRICHIE DIMASO Alright, fine. \nRichie walks out the door. \n111   INT.

We gotta use the big one! \nSMASH TO: \nIRVING ROSENFELD I told you not to put metal in the science oven. Why did you do that for? \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Don't make such a big deal. Just get another one. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I don't want another one. I want the one that Carmine gave me. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD \"I want the one Carmine gave me!\" Carmine, Carmine, why don't you just marry Carmine, get a little gold microwave and put it on a chain around your neck. You want to be more like Carmine? Why don't you build something like he does, instead of all your empty deals that are just like your fucking science oven. You know I read that it takes all of the nutrition out of our food. It's empty, just like your deals. Empty, empty! \nIRVING ROSENFELD That's bullshit. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD It's not bullshit. I read it in an article. Look, by Paul Brodeur. \nSHE HANDS HIM THE MAGAZINE. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Bring something into this house that's gonna take all the nutrition out of our food and then light our house on fire?

Welcome. On behalf of the great state of New Jersey I want to welcome you to New Jersey. I know that was redundant. I'm sorry. I'm just very nervous. \n116   Carmine takes the knife and looks to the others excitedly.       116 \nCARMINE POLITO (CONT'D) (to \"shiek\") We have a great party planned for you this evening. \n118   INT.

Rosalyn looks at him. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Federal agents? \nIRVING ROSENFELD It's bodyguards for the visiting dignitary, that's all. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD What is it, an I.R.S. thing?     Like a tax investigation? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Why you gotta say that? I mean, that's why I can't invite you. It's too complicated. Listen, come on. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Are you in trouble? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Look, stop being so nosy. \nIrving opens the fridge which is a mess. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) Look at this shit. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I'm only nosy cause you never tell me anything. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Can we clean up this fridge?

That's a hundred and thirty years sitting there -- that's how much time's between them. They run the biggest casinos in the United States. We have to work with them. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Right. \nCARMINE POLITO The good news is they know how it's done. They get it done. You don't have to worry. Everyone makes their money. \nIRVING ROSENFELD You mean the Mob? \nCARMINE POLITO Yes, but they're businessmen, okay? Now, spend as much or as little time with them as you like, but we do have to deal with them. All we've got to do is go say hello. We just gotta say hi, that's all. \nEdith looks on, calm, as Richie -- WILD EYED WITH COCAINE AND ADRENALINE -- \nIRVING ROSENFELD Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure that's such a good idea. We gotta confer before we talk to these guys. \nRICHIE DIMASO (interrupting, hopped up) Confer? What is there to confer about? They're casino guys. \nCARMINE POLITO They are businessmen. \nRICHIE DIMASO We came all this way, Irving. We should be here. What's everybody scared of? There's nothing to be scared of. \nRichie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks increasingly uncomfortable. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (re: the mob guys) Those are the guys you're all scared of? Those guys over there? They don't scare me. \nShe glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Rosalyn! \nBut she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine watch. \nRICHIE DIMASO I love this! \nRosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits down in between all the Mafia guys..

Can I sit here? \nCarmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the Mafia guys. \nCARMINE POLITO Irving, this is not a good idea. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD How you guys doing? Everybody over there is really scared of you guys, you know that? \nShe knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved. \nDolly ushers her kids to the door. \nDOLLY POLITO Kids, I want you to go up and get some pizza and soda, please. \nIrving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn. \nEDITH GREENSLY It's a disaster. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I think they have this room all wrong. \nPETE MUSANE Yeah? What would you do? \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I would do it in all black and gold and I would do this bar like a big, warm golden mirror. \nDICK HELSING Sounds beautiful. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Thank you. \nRosalyn's smitten by the mobsters. \nPETE MUSANE But you expect that from her because she's so beautiful -- \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Oh stop. \nDICK HELSING Gorgeous. \nPETE MUSANE I love her hair, so I know I'm gonna love how she'd do the room -- \nHe touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs. Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them. \nRICHIE DIMASO How do you do? \nPETE MUSANE (to Richie) I'm sorry is she your wife? \nIRVING ROSENFELD No, she's my wife. She's my wife. \nCARMINE POLITO Look at these fine gentleman. \nIRVING ROSENFELD That's trouble. \nVICTOR TELLEGIO Who is this guy? (to Irving) What are you, a farmer? \nRichie and Tellegio both laugh. \nCARMINE POLITO Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry, this is Irving. New York businessman. Irving Rosenfeld. \nVICTOR TELLEGIO Irving, Irving. What's the matter, Irving? What's the problem? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Nothing. No problem. \nVICTOR TELLEGIO Don't get your balls in an uproar. Everything's fine, everything's good. It's all good. It's all good. I just hope the other part of this is all good. And real. Because we're real. You know that. You deal with us. We're a real organization. We deal with you, we don't know what we're dealing with. \nEveryone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence. This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to Richie and points to the Sheik. \nIrving watches in horror as -- \nVICTOR TALLEGIO Where's he from? \nRICHIE DIMASO (winging it) Abu Dhabi. \nVICTOR TELLEGIO Oh, he's from the Emirates. \nRICHIE DIMASO Yeah. \nVICTOR TELLEGIO (in subtitled Arabic) (Can I count on you? You gotta be honest about this. Do you understand me? Good means good. No bullshit.) \nPUSH IN ON IRV AND CARMINE FEELING THIS IMMENSE PRESSURE. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE? \nVICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D) (to Sheik) (Did you hear what I said? Do you want me to repeat it?) \nIrving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table. \nVICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D) (What do you think now? Tell me. Tell me.) \nRICHIE DIMASO Uh, I think, I think what he's -- \nVICTOR TELLEGIO No, let him speak for himself. \nSheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense moment for everyone at the table. \nTellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie share a look -- what is he doing? \nA DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys jump in and grab him and start to pull him away. \nCARMINE POLITO No, I know him. \nAL KOWALSKI You guys are way too serious for a party!(to Tellegio) Hey, what are you drinking? You got a drink? \nTELLEGIO GLARES BACK AT THE INTRUSION. \nCARMINE (to Al) We're in a very serious meeting. (to Tellegio) I apologize. \nTELLEGIO DOES NOT LOOK AMUSED. \nAL KALOWSKI I understand, you're in conference. You gotta come with me now. You got a speech to give. Everyone's waiting for you. \nCARMINE POLITO Al, I'll be right behind you, okay? Trust me. \nPaco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS INTRO OF \"WHITE RABBIT\" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK. \nSHEIK ABDULLAH (In Arabic) It is great doing business with you. The investment is real. It was a pleasure to meet you. \nIrving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything passable in Arabic. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) What are the odds of an Italian guy from Miami knowing Arabic? But it turns out he's got casino investments in the Mideast and he spent two years learning it to keep the upper hand. \nVictor leans over to talk to Carmine. \nVICTOR TELLEGIO Listen to me carefully. If you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks. \nCarmine nods. \nVICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D) Carmine, listen to me carefully, if you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks or not only will the Sheik feel insulted, but our friends in Florida will feel deeply disrespected and so will I. \nIrving looks at Victor, who stares back at him. This is bad. \nAT THE BAR -- \n\"WHITE RABBIT\" CONTINUES. ROSALYN CONTINUES TO FLIRT WITH PETE MUSANE -- \nSYDNEY WATCHES OUT OF CONTROL ROSALYN, STANDS AND WALKS OVER TO HER. \nEDITH GREENSLY Rosalyn, you need to come with me alright? \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I don't need to come with you. \nEDITH GREENSLY You need to come with me.

Do we? \nCarmine dominates the crowd and you can see the emotion in his face as he says this. He raises his glass to the crowd. \nCARMINE POLITO (CONT'D) Please, raise a glass with me to a new era that begins tonight. From me and my family, we thank you. For all the hard work that you've given us in the community. Look what you've done. This is beautiful! Thank you! \nCrowd ROARS WILDLY.

SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                   140 \nIRVING ROSENFELD You were right. We should have gone away. \nIrving sits in the corner of the room a disheveled mess. Sydney sits on the bed drinking a Fresca. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) I should have gone away with you. \nSYDNEY PROSSER We were supposed to do it from the feet up like you always said. That's how we were meant to do it but you didn't do it like that. You didn't do it like that. You played it safe so there was always a danger you were going to end up with Rosalyn in the dead space, floating on some dead spaceship with the furniture and the curtains. And I was your life line out and you were mine and that was ok. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (Irving stares at her, emotional) I wish I could get you back. \nHe walks across the room and sits down on the bed next to Sydney. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) You know I can't do it without you. You know that. Come on. Me, you and Danny. Like we said. \nSYDNEY PROSSER Like I said. You never said that. I said that. We gotta get over on all these guys. That's what we need to be thinking about right now. \nIrving takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes. \nIRVING ROSENFELD That's big. That's crazy. Whatever it is, it's got to be the best we've ever done. \nSydney nods her head yes, stares intensely at Irving as the camera tilts down to reveal: their hands clasped together. \n141   EXT.

I believe that he was intoxicated. He threatened me and I told him this was inappropriate. I told him procedures exist for reasons we must respect. This is the third such call I received from Agent Dimaso. He called me again the night of the 5th and he threatened to kill me. Subsequently he demanded that I allow him to use the Sherman Suite at the Plaza hotel for purposes of bribing members of congress. \nCamera pull-back reveals: THE CHASTENED Richie SITS LISTENING, IN A SUIT AND TIE. He's in trouble with their boss, the prosecutor. \nRICHIE DIMASO I am so sorry. \nSTODDARD THORSEN I'm not finished. There's a lot more. \nRichie gets up and pulls up a chair next to Stoddard. Stoddard flinches and moves away like he's going to get hit again. \nRICHIE DIMASO I have nothing but the utmost respect for you as my mentor. (he reaches down and turns the tape recorder off) and as my -- \nSTODDARD THORSEN (re: the recorder) What are you doing? \nRICHIE DIMASO I just want to talk from my heart. I don't want it on record. I want to get vulnerable. \nSTODDARD THORSEN Can I finish? Can I finish my statement? \nRICHIE DIMASO Of course.

Doesn't stop til Stoddard falls to the ground, knocks over desk chair and bookcase behind. \nBACK TO: \nINT. OLD FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWN TOWN \nThey stare at each other. \nRICHIE DIMASO It's just hard for me to control my passion. I'm a very passionate person. (looks to Amado) You're from New York.

It's me. \nRICHIE DIMASO Don't do something that you don't know anything about. Alright? \nRichie grabs his gun and starts to load it. \nSTODDARD THORSEN DO NOT LOAD THAT GUN. YOU DROP THAT GUN. \nRICHIE DIMASO I'll show you how it's done. I'm not even going to hit you. \nHe points the gun at Stoddard. \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) Watch this fucko. \nCUT TO: \nRICHIE DIMASO Listen, I'm sorry. \nSYDNEY PROSSER I'm sorry. \nRICHIE DIMASO (to Irving) I'm sorry Irving. \nIrving doesn't know what to say, starts to say something twice, stops, can't think of what to say.

You like it? \nEDITH GREENSLY I do. \nRICHIE DIMASO (to Schmidt) Give me those flowers. (MORE) \nRICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) If we put the flower base here and put a camera in there we can get a clear shot of the couch there where we can put the congressmen. \nIrving, sitting on the couch, looks kind of disturbed by this. \nIRVING ROSENFELD That's right. That's the idea. \n146   INT. MAYOR CARMINE POLITO'S OFFICE - DAY                        146 \nRICHIE DIMASO (O.S.)

Keeping their money on the sidelines. How we supposed to get anything done? \nJOHN O'CONNELL Bankers only put money in the game when they can reap insane profit. \nRichie staring, mesmerized by this trap. \nRICHIE DIMASO The only problem is this citizenship situation. I mean, we got to expedite it as soon as possible. \nJOHN O'CONNELL Yeah, well I'll tell you, you came to the right place. \nEveryone looks tense and on edge before. \nJOHN O'CONNELL (CONT'D) I'll make it happen. \nCARMINE POLITO Hey, this is going to happen. \nRichie slides the briefcase in John's direction. \nCARMINE POLITO (CONT'D) This is real.

IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nIRVING ROSENFELD I can save all of us, and we can save money. I can take care of you and Danny. OK? But you gotta close your mouth. \nRosalyn looks satisfied and points her finger at Irving. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I knew it. I have always said, Irving, that you are very, very hard to motivate properly. And I knew that Pete was gonna go over there and knock some sense into you. I've been reading this book, Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about the power of intention. \nIrving can't believe what he's hearing right now. \nRosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a book. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D) And my intention in sending Pete over to you was so that you could come up with this plan. So, you're welcome. \nIrving incredulous, thinks to himself how to respond. Forces himself to say gently -- \nIRVING ROSENFELD OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you for the plan. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD You're welcome. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I appreciate that. So, I think that we should be partners on this. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I'm a good partner. Almost better than Edith. You ever think about that? You ever think about how you might have underestimated me? \nIRVING ROSENFELD So what is our plan? Tell me the plan. What are you gonna do? \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I'm going to keep my mouth shut and I'm not going to say anything but what do I do if Pete calls me? What am I supposed to say? \nIRVING ROSENFELD You gotta stop talking about your government agencies and your I.R.S. and your tax and your conspiracies and all of that. You're gonna say how you were wrong, you were wrong about that. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but you know that in real life, I was right for saying all that stuff because then that spurred on the actions that made you come up with this plan. So I will tell Pete. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (holding his head) OK. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD (pointing with cigarette between fingers) The power of intention Irving. The power of intention. \nIrv is doing everything he can to hold it together. \nIRVING ROSENFELD OK. You were right. \nRosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to Irving. \nIRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) You're so smart. Good job, peaches. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Irving, I've been doing a lot of thinking and -- you need to grow up. And you need to face the facts. And I think that both of us will be a lot happier if we get a divorce. \nAs he listens to words he has been saying himself for months, now spoken as Rosalyn's idea. \nIRVING ROSENFELD OK. \nROSALYN ROSENFELD Just think about it.

Sit down. \nThey all sit. \nANTHONY AMADO (CONT'D) Do you know where our two million dollars is? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Two million? (Irving pushes his new glasses up the bridge of his nose) It's with Victor Tellegio and Alfonse Simone. \nANTHONY AMADO No, actually it's not with Victor Tellegio or Alfonse Simone. \nRichie stands by the window, stares angrily at Irving. \nRICHIE DIMASO He fucking knows about it. \nANTHONY AMADO It's gone missing. Did you know that? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Where's it gone? \nANTHONY AMADO That's interesting that you said that because while you were on your way over here, we got an anonymous phone call from someone who said that in exchange for immunity for the two of you and a reduced sentence for Carmine Polito we get our two million dollars back. \nIRVING ROSENFELD That's interesting. That's very interesting. I have no idea. \nANTHONY AMADO No idea? \nIRVING ROSENFELD No idea what you're talking about. \nIrving looks at Sydney who looks back at him and shakes her head. She doesn't know either. \nANTHONY AMADO I got it. I understand how these deals are made. See, someone has leverage. \nRICHIE DIMASO Anthony, fuck them. It's over. We got them for wire fraud, it's over. (to Irving and Sydney) You're done. You're both done. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I don't think so. \nRICHIE DIMASO Oh, you don't think so? \nIRVING ROSENFELD Richard, think about it, YOU requested the two million. And you gave Brenda the account number. We didn't do any of that. None of it. (turns dramatically to face Richie) How do we know that YOU don't have the money? \nRICHIE DIMASO (Richie looks from Irving to Sydney) Am I living in a fucking nightmare right now? \nAMADO AND STODDARD STARE INCRIMINATINGLY AT RICHIE. \nIRVING ROSENFELD I find this a little offensive. Really, I find this a little offensive and I don't see that you got any sort of solid case against-- \nRICHIE DIMASO (to Amado and Stoddard) Don't let him get in your heads. Listen to me, we're dealing with a very clever individual. \nIRVING ROSENFELD Richard, think about it. You got some big arrests. You got U.S. Congressmen. You look good.

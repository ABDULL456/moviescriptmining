{"train": "AMERICAN PSYCHO by Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner \nAMERICAN PSYCHO \nby Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner \nBased on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis \nFourth Draft November 1998 \nINT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT \nAn insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side. The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Ala\u00efa, Armani power suits. \nCLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials. \nWAITER With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula Caesar salad. For entr\u00e9es tonight I have a swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale... \nHuge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four inches square and look exactly alike. \nCLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of conversation. \"Is that Charlie Sheen over there?\" \"Excuse me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet.\" \nWAITER And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth... \nCLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate perpendicular desserts descending on another table. \nPATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses. \nThe camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins: \nBATEMAN (V.O.) We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California place on the Upper East Side. \nThe Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's description of each of the men at the table. \nBATEMAN (V.O.) You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . \nVAN PATTEN What are the rules for a sweater vest? \nMcDERMOTT What do you mean? \nPRICE Yes. Clarify. \nMcDERMOTT Well, is it strictly informal- \nBATEMAN Or can it be worn with a suit? \nMcDERMOTT (Smiling) Exactly \nBATEMAN With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder vest. \nMcDERMOTT But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look too studied. \nVAN PATTEN You think so? \nPRICE You'll look like you consciously worked for the look. \nVAN PATTEN Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen. \nVan Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy discreetly removes their largely untouched plates. \nBATEMAN Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out? \nPRICE It looks that way, doesn't it? \nMcDERMOTT (Staring at retreating waiter) Did he just take our plates away? \nPRICE He took them away because the portions are so small he probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia? \nMcDERMOTT Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head. (He guffaws) \nBateman throws a swizzle stick at him. \nMcDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses. \nMcDERMOTT Is that Reed Robinson over there? PRICE Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson. \nALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl. \nEXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nThe limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel. McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN, who looks confused. \nMcDERMOTT I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask him if he takes American Express. \nPRICE (Offering card) You take Amex, dude? \nThe man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine, unhooks the velvet rope and welcomes them inside. \nINT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT \nBrilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels. MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes past them and slams the door. \nPRICE There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy- \nBATEMAN I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus. \nPRICE Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it. \nPrice and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is sweating. \nPRICE I'm shaking. You open it. \nBateman opens a tiny packet of coke. \nPRICE Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it? \nBATEMAN Maybe it's just the light. \nPRICE Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) Oh my God... \nBATEMAN What? \nPRICE It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low! \nBateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts. \nBATEMAN It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay. \nPRICE I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran. \nThe GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate voice: \nGUY IN STALL Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs! \nPrice pounds his fist against the stall. \nPRICE (screaming) SHUT UP! \nBATEMAN Calm down. Let's do it anyway \nPRICE I guess you're right... (Raising his voice) THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY! \nGUY IN STALL Fuck you! \nPRICE (Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider) No, FUCK YOU!! (He collapses, panting against the stall door) Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it. \nBATEMAN That's the spirit. \nThey both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into their gums. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nBateman saunters toward the bar as \"Pump Up the Volume\" plays in the background. \nBATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks. \nHe hands her two drink tickets. \nBARGIRL It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars. \nBateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her a $50. \nJean follows him into his office. \nJEAN Oh? And what should I say? \nBATEMAN Just...say...no. \nJEAN Just say no? \nJean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions. \nBATEMAN Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right? \nJEAN (Playfully) Yes, sir. \nShe turns to leave. \nBATEMAN Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight tonight. \nJean turns around. \nJEAN Oh, something. . romantic? \nBATEMAN No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks. \nJEAN I'll do it. \nBATEMAN No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay? \nJEAN You look nice today. \nJean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment later with the Perrier and a file. \nJEAN Yes? \nBATEMAN Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again. \nJEAN Ummm...what? I didn't hear you. \nBATEMAN I said \"Do not wear that outfit again.\" Wear a dress. A skirt or something. \nJean stands there, then looks down at herself. \nJEAN (Smiling bravely) You don't like this, I take it? \nBATEMAN Come on, you're prettier than that. \nJEAN (Sarcastically) Thanks, Patrick. \nThe phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave. \nBATEMAN I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels. \nAs Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner of the room and starts watching Jeopardy! \nINT. TAXI - EVENING \nEVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's fianc\u00e9e, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a small child. \nEVELYN I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell. \nCLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring out the window. \nBATEMAN (V.O.) I'm trying to listen to the new George Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fianc\u00e9e-keeps buzzing in my ear. \nEvelyn continues to make notes. \nEVELYN Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it. \nBATEMAN (Removing his Walkman) Do...what. \nEVELYN Get married. Have a wedding. \nBATEMAN Evelyn? \nEVELYN Yes, darling? \nBATEMAN Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice. \nThe table stares at Bateman uncomfortably. \nBATEMAN We also have to control the influx of illegal immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people. \nPrice chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and mystified. \nCARRUTHERS Patrick, how thought-provoking. \nINT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING \nBateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television. \nBATEMAN Why don t you just go for Price? \nEVELYN Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price? \nBATEMAN He's rich. \nEVELYN Everybody's rich. \nBATEMAN He's good-looking. \nEVELYN Everybody's good-looking, Patrick. \nBATEMAN He has a great body \nEVELYN Everybody has a great body now. \nBateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally, he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to look around him at the TV, then takes notice. \nEVELYN What do you want to do with that, floss with it? \nBateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television. \nEVELYN Are you using minoxidil? \nBATEMAN No. I'm not. Why should I ? \nEVELYN Your hairline looks like it's receding. \nBATEMAN It's not. \nEXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT \nIt is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine. Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up to her as she pauses at a red light. \nBATEMAN Hello. \nThe woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing his smile, smiles back. \nINT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY \nBateman, dressed in an Armani suit with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the counter. \nBATEMAN Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait... you're not giving me valid reasons. \nThe woman continues to speak to him in another language, grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket. \nBATEMAN What are you trying to say to me? \nHer husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained sheets out of the bag and is staring at them. \nBATEMAN Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee? Bleach-ee. Oh my God. \nShe keeps pointing to the jacket and talking. \nBATEMAN (Talking over her) Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question. Two. (Louder) Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very expensive sheets and I really need them clean. \nShe keeps talking and Bateman leans into her. \nBATEMAN If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill you, are you understanding me? \nShe talks faster. \nBateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face. \nBATEMAN Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. (He slaps her again lightly) Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate! \nCOURTNEY (Choking crying) Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS. \nBateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom. \nBATEMAN See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch? \nCOURTNEY Oh God, just get it over with. \nHe fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the ceiling. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY \nBateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto a spectacular view of Manhattan. \nCARRUTHERS Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there? \nBATEMAN Lucky, I guess. \nCARRUTHERS That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture? \nBATEMAN Uh huh. \nCARRUTHERS (Reaching out to touch it) It looks so soft. \nBATEMAN (Catching Luis hand) Your compliment was sufficient Luis. \nCarruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men. \nOWEN (To Bateman) Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you? \nBATEMAN I've been great. And you? \nTheir conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's thoughts. \nBATEMAN (V.O.) Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut. \nDuring this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the opposite corner of the room. He bears a superficial resemblance to Bateman. \nOWEN How's the Ransom account going, Marcus? \nBATEMAN (Nervous) It's...it's...all right. \nOWEN Really? That's interesting. (He stares at Bateman, smiling) Not great? \nBATEMAN Oh well, you know. \nOWEN And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl. \nBATEMAN Oh yes. I'm very lucky. \nMcDermott and Price enter. \nMcDERMOTT Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account. \nOWEN Thank you, Baxter. \nPRICE Listen, Paul. Squash? \nOWEN Call me. (Hands him a business card) \nPRICE How about Friday? \nOWEN No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers. \nCLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred. \nPRICE (Whispering) Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that? \nMcDERMOTT (Whispering) I think he's lying. \nBateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card. \nBATEMAN Is this what you need? \nThe Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose. \nHOMELESS MAN I'm so hungry. \nBATEMAN It's cold out, too, isn't it? \nHOMELESS MAN I'm so hungry. \nBATEMAN (Holding the bill just out of the man's reach) Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job? \nHOMELESS MAN (Shivering and sobbing) I lost my job... \nBATEMAN Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job? \nHOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off. \nBATEMAN Gee, uh, that's too bad. \nHOMELESS MAN I'm so hungry. \nThe dog starts to whimper. \nBATEMAN Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job? \nHOMELESS MAN I'm not... \nBATEMAN You're not what? Qualified for anything else? \nHOMELESS MAN I'm hungry \nBATEMAN I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you. \nHOMELESS MAN I'm hungry. \nBATEMAN Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work? \nHOMELESS MAN What am I gonna do? \nBATEMAN Listen, what's your name? \nHOMELESS MAN Al. \nBATEMAN Speak up. Come on. \nHOMELESS MAN Al. \nBATEMAN Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you. \nHOMELESS MAN You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell. \nBATEMAN (Petting the dog) Shhhh...it's okay. \nHOMELESS MAN (Grabbing Bateman's wrist) Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold. \nBATEMAN (Stroking his face, whispering) Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God. \nHOMELESS MAN I can't...I can't find a shelter \nBATEMAN You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? (Shouting) Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry. \nBateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet. \nBATEMAN It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common with you. \nHe opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to protect it. \nBATEMAN Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are? \nHOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife. \nEXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach. The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is silent. \nLOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground. \nOWEN I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you. \nHe guffaws. Bateman laughs politely. \nLATER: Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober. \nBATEMAN I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane? \nOwen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another drink. \nOWEN Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan? \nBATEMAN Salon. \nOWEN I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it. \nBateman nods, agitated. \nOWEN And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight? \nBATEMAN Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams. \nOWEN Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork. \nBATEMAN Another Martini, Paul? \nOwen nods drunkenly. \nLATER: \nThe end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid down. \nBATEMAN (Talking to Owen like a child) Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check. \nBATEMAN Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap? \nOWEN No, man. I'm gonna bail. \nBATEMAN Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. (Helping him into his jacket) I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us. \nINT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The living room floor has been meticulously covered with newspaper. \nOwen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs. \nBATEMAN You like Huey Lewis and the News? \nOWEN They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. \nBateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the shower. He takes two Valium. \nBATEMAN (Said partly from the bathroom) The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen from behind ail the time. \nBATEMAN He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. \nOwen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys catalogue. \nOWEN Hey, Halberstam? \nBATEMAN Yes, Owen? \nOWEN Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something? \nBATEMAN No, Owen. \nOWEN (Confused) Is that a raincoat? \nBATEMAN Yes, it is. \nBateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its case and slides it in the machine. \nBATEMAN In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is \"HiP To Be Square,\" a song so catchy that most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself. \nBateman puts on \"Hip To Be Square.\" \nBATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax. \nBateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes the Walkman off. \nBATEMAN (Faintly irritable) What is it? \nJEAN Patrick? \nBATEMAN (Condescendingly) Ye-es, Je-an? \nJEAN Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you. \nBATEMAN Who? \nJEAN Detective Donald KIMBALL? \nSilence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back cover of Sports Illustrated. \nBATEMAN Tell him I'm at lunch. \nJEAN (whispering) Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty. \nSilence. \nBATEMAN Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end. \nBATEMAN Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties... \nThe door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age - and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of the type Bateman and his friends might wear. \nKimball sits down and crosses his legs with a self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at him curiously, noticing the silence. \nBATEMAN (Realizing that Kimball is staring at him) Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent. \nBateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in exasperation. \nKIMBALL nods understandingly. \nBATEMAN Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in... (He laughs inanely) Just joking... (Pause) No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it. (He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in) Sorry about that. \nKIMBALL No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. (Gesturing toward the phone) Was that anything important? \nBATEMAN Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip. \nThey laugh politely. \nKIMBALL (Holding out his hand) Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL \nBATEMAN (Shaking firmly) Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you. \nKIMBALL I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get. \nKIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk. Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is still running. \nBATEMAN (Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed) So, what's the topic of discussion? \nKIMBALL I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen. \nBATEMAN You're not with the FBI or anything, are you? \nKIMBALL Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator. \nBATEMAN Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes. \nKIMBALL So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself- \nBATEMAN Coffee? \nKIMBALL No. I'm okay. \nBATEMAN Perrier? San Pellegrino? \nKIMBALL No, I'm okay. \nKIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes Jean. \nJEAN (O.S.) Patrick? \nA perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian, a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect green grapes, a few berries. \nOFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard from the living room. \nThe living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table, next to a copy of GQ. \nLATER: \nBateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand, jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing. \nBATEMAN You like that, slut? \nThe person on the other end clearly hangs up. \nCLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone. \nBATEMAN You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white cotton T-shirt by Commes des Garcons. (He snorts like a pig) My Rolex cost- \nAnother hang-up. He dials again. \nBATEMAN (Whipering) I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do you think of that? (Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts) Huh, bitch? \nGIRL (O.S.) Dad, is that you? \nBateman hangs up, frustrated. \nEXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nBateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket. Bateman opens his window to speak to her. \nBATEMAN I haven't seen you around here. \nCHRISTIE You just haven't been looking. \nBATEMAN Would you like to see my apartment? \nBateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a tuxedo. \nCHRISTIE (looking away to some dark corner) I'm not supposed to. \nBateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now notices, then takes. \nBATEMAN Do you want to come to my apartment or not? \nCHRISTIE I'm not supposed to. (She pockets the bill) But I can make an exception. \nBATEMAN Do you take American Express? \nChristie is still looking out behind her. \nBATEMAN Do you take American Express? \nChristie looks at him like he's crazy. \nBATEMAN I'm joking. Come on, get in. \nAs they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He reads off a credit card number. \nBATEMAN I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really can't stress blonde enough. Blonde. \nHe hangs up. \nBATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that? You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is that clear? \nINT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nChristie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white milky bath oil. \nBATEMAN That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking. \nLong pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and Bateman is casually touching her breast. \nBATEMAN I want you to clean your vagina. \nChristie reaches for a washcloth. \nHe turns on the video camera. \nBATEMAN Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your asshole. \nBateman looks through the viewfinder. \nBATEMAN Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially songs like \"In the Air Tonight\" and \"Against All Odds.\" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. \nHe walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in the CD. \nBATEMAN But I also think that Phill Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and I stress the word artist. This is \"Sussudio,\" a great, great song, a personal favorite. \nSEX MONTAGE CUT TO \"Sussudio.\" We see this in WIDE SHOT, or through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA. \nCUT TO: \nBateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his wrist. Bateman's eyes open. \nBATEMAN Don't touch the Rolex. \nBateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire. \nHe opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger, a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger. \nBATEMAN We're not through yet... \nCUT TO: \nBateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the b.g. Phil Collins' \"In the Air Tonight\" is playing. \nINT. YALE CLUB \u0096 DAY \nMcDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and gives them the finger. \nBATEMAN What an asshole. \nMcDERMOTT Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a fucking drug addict. No self-control. \nVAN PATTEN But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman? \nBATEMAN I know her. I knew her. \nMcDERMOTT Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it like that? \nVAN PATTEN Because he dated her. \nBATEMAN How did you guess? \nVAN PATTEN Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman. \nBATEMAN Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality. \nMcDERMOTT So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other reason. \nVAN PATTEN If they have a good personality, then something is very wrong. \nMcDERMOTT If they have a good personality and they are not great looking-who fucking cares? \nBATEMAN Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if they have a good personality? (He smiles giving up) I know, I know- \nALL IN UNISON There are no girls with good personalities! (They laugh and high-five each other) \nVAN PATTEN A good personality consists of a chick with a little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut. \nMcDERMOTT Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly chicks. \nVAN PATTEN Absolutely. \nMcDERMOTT And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are. \nPause. \nBATEMAN Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? \nVAN PATTEN Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar? \nBATEMAN What? CARRUTHERS (Silently mouthing the words) I'll call you. \nBateman storms out of the restaurant. \nINT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex. Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy, a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence. \nCOURTNEY Will you call me before Thanksgiving? \nBATEMAN Maybe. \nCourtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches the TV at low volume. \nCOURTNEY What are you doing tonight? \nBATEMAN Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe. \nCOURTNEY That's nice. \nBATEMAN You and...Luis? \nCOURTNEY (Lighting a cigarette) We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is... \nBATEMAN I never knew you smoked. \nCOURTNEY (Smiling sadly) You never noticed. \nBateman is making final adjustments to his tie. \nCOURTNEY Listen...Patrick. Can we talk? \nBATEMAN You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less. \nCOURTNEY (Sarcastically) Isn't that special? (A pause) Patrick? \nBATEMAN Yes, Courtney? \nC0URTNEY If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay? \nBATEMAN (Flatly) You too. \nCourtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door. \nCOURTNEY Patrick? \nBATEMAN Yes? \nCOURTNEY Nothing. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nA big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies. \nI Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him. \nKIMBALL Mr. Bateman? \nBateman gasps and recovers. \nBATEMAN Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball. (Extending his hand) Call me Don. \nBATEMAN Don. \nKIMBALL So...you hang out here a lot? \nBATEMAN Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know. \nPause. \nBATEMAN How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for \"formal questioning?\" (He makes quotation marks in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh) \nKIMBALL 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli? \nBATEMAN Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump. \nMUCH LATER IN THE EVENING: \nThe club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman is reaching for him. \nPRICE (Shouting) I'm leaving. I'm getting out. \nBATEMAN Leaving what? \nPRICE This. \nBateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his drink. \nBATEMAN Don't, I'll drink it. \nPRICE (Screaming) Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving. \nBATEMAN Where to? Are you going to go get a gram? \nPRICE I'm leaving! I...am...leaving! \nBATEMAN Don't tell me...merchant banking? \nPRICE No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing. \nBATEMAN (laughing) Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What? \nPrice looks away. \nMcDermott and Daisy walk up to them. \nMcDERMOTT Hey-don't worry, be happy. \nPrice lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is shouting something that can't be heard, then \nPRICE Goodbye! Fuckheads! \nHe climbs over the railing. \nDAISY What is he doing? \nBATEMAN Price! Come back! \nPrice leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd. \nEXT. CLUB - NIGHT Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab. \nDAISY My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand what I was doing with a yuppie. \nBATEMAN Oh really? DAISY He said... (She laughs) He said you gave him bad vibes. \nBATEMAN That's...that's too bad. \nDAISY You think I'm dumb, don't you? \nBATEMAN What? \nDAISY You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb. \nBATEMAN (insincerely) No. I really don't. \nDAISY That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you. \nShe takes his hand as they get into a cab. \nINT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT \nBateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the case. \nINT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nBateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York Times crossword puzzle at dusk. \nJean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her. \nJEAN Doin' the crossword? \nA pause. \nKIMBALL Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? (He checks his notebook) Which was on the twentieth of December? \nBATEMAN God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes. \nHe opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his diary. \nBATEMAN I had a date with a girl named Veronica. \nKIMBALL Wait. That's not what I've got. \nBATEMAN What? \nKIMBALL That's not the information I've received. \nBATEMAN Well...I...Wait...What information have you received? \nKIMBALL Let's see... (He flips through his notebook) That you were with- \nBATEMAN Well, I could he wrong. \nKIMBALL Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen? \nBATEMAN (Clearly nervous and under pressure) We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's. \nKimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens his briefcase to put away his notebook. \nKIMBALL Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman. \nBATEMAN Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered. \nKIMBALL Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information? \nBATEMAN Great, yes, I'd like that. \nKIMBALL And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier. \nBATEMAN Absolutely. I'm with you on that one. \nKimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up. \nKIMBALL Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I just bought it on my way here. \nBateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified. \nBATEMAN Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers. \nKIMBALL Not a big music fan, eh? \nBATEMAN No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me. \nKIMBALL Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations. \nBATEMAN I'll be there. \nEXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nThe same street corner where Bateman found Christie before. The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a half-opened window. \nCHRISTIE I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time... \nBATEMAN Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise. \nCHRISTIE I don't think so. \nHe hands her a $500 bill. \nBATEMAN Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. \nThe driver's here, you'll be safe. \nChristie gets in hesitantly. \nBATEMAN Nothing like last time, promise. \nBATEMAN She's from...France. \nA pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously. \nELIZABETH Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley. \nBateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares At Christie while she waits for someone to answer. \nELIZABETH Where do you summer? Southampton? \nChristie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth. \nCHRISTIE No. \nELIZABETH (Listening to the receiver) Oh God, it's his machine. \nBATEMAN Elizabeth, it's three in the morning. \nELIZABETH He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours. \nBATEMAN Don't tell him you're here. \nELIZABETH Why would I? \nBateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the whole glass, making a face. \nELIZABETH This tastes weird. (She examines the label and shrugs) Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at- \nBATEMAN (Whispering) You're at Paul Owen s. \nELIZABETH Who? \nBATEMAN (Whispering) Paul Owen. \nELIZABETH I want the number, idiot. (She waves him away and continues into the reciever) Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you. \nShe hangs up. \nELIZABETH Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours? \nBATEMAN No. \nELIZABETH Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon. \nBateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her another glass of the drugged wine. \nBATEMAN Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free. \nELIZABETH (Laughing) Patrick, you re a lunatic. \nBATEMAN Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive? \nELIZABETH Let's not get lewd. (Flirty) I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation. \nBATEMAN Come on. I think it would be a turn-on. \nELIZABETH (To Christie) Does he do this all the time? \nChristie shrugs. \nBATEMAN Christie, you're not drinking your wine. \nChristie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip. \nBATEMAN (To Elizabeth) Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl? \nELIZABETH No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that? \nBATEMAN Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. \nELIZABETH Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird. \nLATER: \nElizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD, showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover. \nBATEMAN I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch. \nEvelyn waves to a couple across the room. \nEVELYN (Distracted) Why? What's wrong? \nBATEMAN (Speaking very carefully, measuring each word) My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs. \nThe woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly. \nBATEMAN We need to talk. \nEVELYN Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about? \nBATEMAN It's over, Evelyn. It's all over \nEVELYN (Motioning to the waiter for water) Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee? \nBATEMAN I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore. \nEVELYN But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work. (Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin) You have a little something on your upper lip. \nBATEMAN (Brushing her hand away) I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them. \nEvelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a realization dawning. \nEVELYN You're really serious, aren't you? \nBATEMAN Yes, I am. \nEVELYN But what about the past? Our past? \nBATEMAN We never really shared one. \nEVELYN You're inhuman. \nBATEMAN I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. (He pauses, as if searching for the right words) You're just not terribly important to me. \nEvelyn begins to cry. \nEVELYN No, no, no. \nBATEMAN I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes. \nShe reaches desperately across the table and takes his hand. Bateman pulls his hand away. \nEVELYN (Sobbing) What do you want me to do, what is it you want? \nThe occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed. \nBATEMAN (Looking uncomfortably around the room) If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now. \nEVELYN Oh God, I can't believe this. \nBATEMAN I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going. \nEvelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the tears so they will not affect her make-up. \nEVELYN (Surprisingly calm) Where are you going? \nBATEMAN I'm just leaving. \nEVELYN But where? \nBATEMAN I have to return some videotapes. \nHe rushes out of the room. \nEXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING \nBateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat. \nBATEMAN Here kitty, kitty. \nThe small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT. Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him. \nKIMBALL (Looking at him like he's nuts) Suit yourself, I guess. \nPause. \nKIMBALL So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did? \nBATEMAN I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet? \nKIMBALL I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up. \nBATEMAN But how? Where do you place Paul that night? \nKIMBALL According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam. \nBATEMAN And? \nKIMBALL I've questioned him. \nBATEMAN Marcus? \nKIMBALL Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure. \nBATEMAN But Marcus denied it? \nKIMBALL Yes. \nBATEMAN Well, does Marcus have an alibi? \nKIMBALL Yes. \nA pause. \nBATEMAN He does? You're sure? \nKIMBALL (smiling) I checked it out. It's clean. \nBATEMAN Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? (He laughs) \nBATEMAN (Laughing with him) Where was Marcus? \nKIMBALL He wasn't with Paul Owen. \nBATEMAN So who was he with? \nKIMBALL He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and \u0096 (He pauses, Then looks up) - you. \nA moment of stunned silence. \nBATEMAN Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night. \nKIMBALL Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. (A pause) I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? \nMcDermott stops by the table. \nMcDERMOTT KIMBALL! How's the investigation? Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says. (Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back) Bateman, what's wrong with ,you? \nBateman looks at him in silence, panicking. \nMcDERMOTT You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long. (He wanders off muttering) No fucking hash browns... \nINT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nBateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He has a surgical mask in one hand. \nDOORMAN What can I do for you, sir? \nBATEMAN 20B. \nDOORMAN Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now. \nBATEMAN Mrs. Wolfe? \nDOORMAN The real estate agent? You do have an appointment, don't you? \nBateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs. Wolfe approaches, smiling. \nJEAN (O.S.) Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong? \nBATEMAN I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean. \nPause. \nBATEMAN ...to the office this afternoon. \nJEAN (O.S.) Why? \nBATEMAN (Screaming) Just...say...no! \nJEAN (O.S.) What is it, Patrick? Are you alright? \nBATEMAN Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus! \nHe hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his jacket. \nINT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY \nJean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it. \nINT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING \nBateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, still breathing heavily. \nPrice is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations. \nMcDERMOTT Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough day at the office? \nThey all laugh. \nMcDERMOTT Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't get a reservation to save his life. \nBateman sits down silently. \nMcDERMOTT Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them. \nBATEMAN (On automatic) I'm not going anywhere unless we have a reservation. \nVAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, faggots-just get a res. \nPRICE Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders. \nBateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses. \nBATEMAN (He downs his drink) Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously. \nCARNES Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s. \nBateman approaches, trying to act casual. \nBATEMAN Shut up, Carnes, they will not. \nCarnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused. \nBATEMAN So, Harold, did you get my message? \nCarnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs. \nCARNES Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it? \nBATEMAN (Waving smoke out of his face) Yes, naturally. \nCARNES Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich... \nPause \nCARNES It was a pretty long message, wasn't it? \nBATEMAN What exactly do you mean? \nCARNES The message you left. \nCarnes is distracted, waving at people. \n", "test1_input": "COURTNEY Stop it. I'm... \nBATEMAN On a lot of lithium? \nCOURTNEY Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick. \nBATEMAN You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when? \nBATEMAN Am I confused or were we talking about tonight? \nCOURTNEY Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that. \nBATEMAN Pumpkin? \nCOURTNEY Yes? \nBATEMAN Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. \nCOURTNEY Uh huh. \nBATEMAN Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. \nCOURTNEY I know. Stop it. \nBATEMAN Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed. \nCOURTNEY Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go. \nBATEMAN Courtney? Dinner? \nCOURTNEY I can't. \nBATEMAN I'm thinking Dorsia. \nCOURTNEY Dorsia's nice. \nBATEMAN Nice? \nCOURTNEY You like it there, don't you? \nBATEMAN The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight. \nCOURTNEY Okay. Yeah. What time? \nBATEMAN Eight? \nCOURTNEY Pick me up? \nBATEMAN Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember? \nBateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there is finally an answer. \nMAITRE D' Dorsia. Please hold. \nHe is on hold for a long time, getting very tense. \nMAITRE D' Dorsia. \nBATEMAN (Both of his eyes are closed) Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps? \nLong pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he hangs up the phone. \nINT. TAXI- NIGHT \nBateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is heavily medicated. \nCOURTNEY A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. (She starts to pass out) \nBATEMAN Is that Donald Trump's car? \nCOURTNEY (Thickly) Oh God, Patrick. Shut up. \nBATEMAN You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump. \nCOURTNEY I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... (Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze) \n", "test1_true": "INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT \nAn insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths, minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting. \nA waiter has come to take their drink orders. \nBATEMAN J&B. Straight. \nCOURTNEY Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up. \nCOURTNEY Are we here? \nBATEMAN Yes. \nCOURTNEY This is Dorsia? \nBATEMAN (Examining a menu that says \"Barcadia\" in large script) Yes, dear. \nCourtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both shoulders and props her up. \nBATEMAN Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish.\" You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. \nCOURTNEY Mmmm...thanks, Patrick. \nShe falls asleep at the table. \nINT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears it open with his teeth, puts it on. \nCOURTNEY (Dazed on lithium) I want you to fuck me. \nBateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her. \nCOURTNEY Luis is a despicable twit. \nBATEMAN Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him. \nHe keeps fucking her. \nCOURTNEY No, you idiot. I said \"Is it a receptacle tip?\" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me. \nBATEMAN Is it a what? \nCOURTNEY Pull out. \nBATEMAN I'm ignoring you. \nCOURTNEY (screaming) Pull out, goddamnit! \nBATEMAN (Slowing down but not stopping) What do you want, Courtney? \nShe pushes him away from her. \nBATEMAN It's a plain end. I think. \nCOURTNEY Turn the light on. \nShe tries to sit up. \nBATEMAN Oh Jesus. I'm going home. \nCOURTNEY Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light. \nBATEMAN It's a plain end, see? So? \nCOURTNEY Take it off. \nBATEMAN Why? \nCOURTNEY Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip \u0096 (She covers herself with her comforter) to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium? \nCourtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying. \nCOURTNEY (Screaming) Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex? \n", "test2_input": "BATEMAN No problem. (Buzzing Jean) \nJEAN (O.S.) Yes, Patrick? \nBATEMAN Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence. \nKIMBALL What can you tell me about Paul Owen? \nBATEMAN Well... \nHe coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows them dry. \nKIMBALL How well did you know him? \nBATEMAN I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know. \nKIMBALL Yale thing? \nA pause. \nBATEMAN Yeah...Yale thing. \nKIMBALL What do you mean...Yale thing? \nA pause. \nBATEMAN Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing. \nA silence during which the sound of the air conditioner becomes deafening. \nKIMBALL So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen? \nBATEMAN He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet. \nKIMBALL What kind of man was he? Besides... (He hesitates tries to smile) the information you've just given. \nBATEMAN I hope I'm not being cross-examined here. \nKIMBALL Do you feel that way? \nBATEMAN No. Not really. \nKIMBALL (As he writes without looking up) Where did Paul hang out? \nBATEMAN Hang...out? \nKIMBALL Yeah. You know...hang out. \nBATEMAN Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places. \nKIMBALL He had a yacht? \nBATEMAN No, he just hung out there. \nKIMBALL And where did he go to school? \nA slight pause. \nBATEMAN Don't you know this? \nKIMBALL I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help. \nKIMBALL I understand. \nHe makes another note. \nKIMBALL Anything else you can tell me about Owen? \nBATEMAN We were both seven in 1969. \nKIMBALL (Smiles) So was I. \nBATEMAN Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints? \nKIMBALL Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London. \n", "test2_true": "KIMBALL His girlfriend doesn't think so. \nBATEMAN But...has anyone seen him in London? \nKIMBALL Actually, yes. \nBATEMAN Hmmm. \nKIMBALL Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so... \nBATEMAN Oh. \nKIMBALL Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship? \nBATEMAN What? \nKIMBALL I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts- \nBATEMAN Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and- \nKIMBALL Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing. \nA pause - the longest so far. \nBATEMAN Have you consulted a psychic? \nKIMBALL No. \nBATEMAN Had his apartment been burglarized? \nKIMBALL No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it. \nBATEMAN I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right? \nKIMBALL No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything. \nBATEMAN That's so typical, isn't it? \nKIMBALL It's just strange. (He stares out the window, lost in thought) One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then... \nBATEMAN Nothing. \nKIMBALL People just...disappear. \nBATEMAN The earth just opens up and swallows people. (He checks his Rolex) \nKIMBALL Eerie. Really eerie. \nSilence. \nBATEMAN (Standing up) You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes. \nKIMBALL Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late? \nBATEMAN Uh, no. There's one...down here. \nKIMBALL Oh really? I didn't know that. \nBateman leads him to the door. \nBATEMAN Yes. It's very good. \nKIMBALL turns to face him. \nKIMBALL Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all... \nBATEMAN Absolutely, I'm 100% with you. \nKIMBALL Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman. \nBateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his eyes and leans against the door, sweating. \nINT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON \n", "test3_input": "BATEMAN They know me. \nPause. \nBATEMAN Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock for drinks, okay? \nShe turns to leave. \nBATEMAN And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out. \nINT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING \nJean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out. \nJEAN Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view. \nBateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady visible. \nBATEMAN Jean? Sorbet? \nJEAN Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some. \nBateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in his hand and hands her the sorbet. \nJean is eating the sorbet. \nJEAN Want a bite? \nBATEMAN I'm on a diet. But thank you. \nJEAN You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit. \nBATEMAN (Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness) You can always he thinner. Look...better. \nJEAN Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower. \nBATEMAN No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway. \nSilence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up his knife drawer, looking at the knives. \nBATEMAN So listen, what do you really want to do with your life? \nPause. \nBATEMAN And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay? \nJEAN Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure. \nBateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge of the blade. \nBATEMAN Do you have a boyfriend? \nJEAN No, not really. \nBATEMAN Interesting. \nJEAN (Shyly) Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? \nBATEMAN Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun. \nBATEMAN Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life? \nJEAN Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing. \nBATEMAN Growing. I'm glad you said that. \nBateman picks up the duct tape. \nBATEMAN Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this? \nJEAN Who's Ted Bundy? \nBATEMAN Forget it. \nJEAN What's that? \n", "test3_true": "JEAN Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy? \nJean puts her spoon down on the table. \nBATEMAN (Looking up from loading nails into the gun) What...No! Put it in the carton. \nJEAN Sorry. (She puts the spoon in the carton) \nBATEMAN Jean? What? \nJEAN Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to? \nFrom behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and stands behind the couch. \nBATEMAN I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special. \nJEAN Hmmmm. \nHe points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head. The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch. He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she listens to the message. \nEVELYN Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy. What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope you're not out with some little number you picked up because you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar, auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps! You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye. \nSilence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset. \nJEAN Was that...Evelyn? \nSilence. \nJEAN Are you still seeing her? \nSilence. \nJEAN I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that. \nSilence. \nJEAN Do you want me to go? \nA long pause. \nBATEMAN Yes. I don t think I can...control myself. \nJEAN I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go? \nAnother long pause. \nBATEMAN If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. (Almost hopefully) You don't want to get hurt, do you? \nJEAN No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go. \nShe gets up to leave. \nJEAN And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21. \nBATEMAN Thanks. It slipped my mind completely. \nHe sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes. \nINT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nBateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting the door behind him. \nBATEMAN Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda? \nJean looks flustered. \nKimball follows Bateman into his office. \nKIMBALL I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence. \nBATEMAN Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. (Hopefully) Is he a suspect? \nKIMBALL Not really. \n"}

CRASH! The battering ram breaks through the postern door, which falls out of the door frame. 
COGSWORTH We need help! 
He lopes towards the staircase. 
105    INT. ASYLUM WAGON - VILLAGE OF VILLENEUVE - NIGHT          105 
Belle gazes out the prison bars, sees d'Arque pacing by the fountain. She whispers to Maurice -- 
BELLE I have to warn the beast -- 
MAURICE Warn him?    How did you get away from him? 
BELLE He let me go, papa.     He sent me back to you. 
MAURICE I don't understand. 
She holds up the rose-shaped rattle.    Maurice recognizes it immediately. 
BELLE He took me there. I know what happened to maman. 
Maurice takes the rattle.   Stunned. 
MAURICE Then you know I had to leave her there. I had to protect you. I've always tried to protect you... too much, perhaps... 
He stops, eyes filled with tears. 
BELLE I understand. 
She takes his hand and kisses it. 
BELLE (CONT'D) Will you help me now? 
MAURICE It's dangerous. 
BELLE Yes.   Yes it is. 
Maurice sees the courage and determination in her eyes.   And his own eyes light up with an idea. 
MAURICE Of course I could try to pick the lock. After all, it's only gears and springs. But I would need something long and sharp -- 
He stops as Belle, a step ahead, removes and hands him one of her long hairpins. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Like that.     Perfect. 
Maurice gets to work. 
104   EXT. HIGHEST TURRET - CASTLE - NIGHT                       104 
Cogsworth hops up the spiral staircase and out onto the turret. He spots the beast, perched among the gargoyles. 
COGSWORTH Pardon me, master. I'm sorry to disturb you, but -- 
THE BEAST She's not coming back. 
COGSWORTH No... the castle is under attack! 
THE BEAST It doesn't matter now.    Just let them come. 
106   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - NIGHT                              106 
The battering ram smashes against the door. 
MOB Kill the beast!     Kill the beast! 
107   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                107 
The door is giving way, the mob is too strong. 
MRS. POTTS This isn't working! 
LUMIÃˆRE I know what to do. 
108   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - NIGHT                              108 
The battering ram smashes again. 
MOB Kill the beast!     Kill the beast! 
109   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                109

ISRAEL - DAY              1 \nA strange ROARING sound... \nCLOSE ON A YOUNG WOMAN \n...in darkness. Light begins to spill on her from the right - revealing her face, lost in thought. This is RACHEL SINGER - pretty, painfully young looking. A surgical dressing covers half her face. \nAs we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit either side of her. They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick- set, capable, and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties), dark-haired and pale-faced. \nThe three faces in the darkness, each looking straight ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting. \nThe roaring, which we realise is the sound of ENGINES, gradually runs down into silence. \nThe light from the bay door which is opening off-screen begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT, revealing the inside of a CARGO PLANE. \nStephan turns to look at the growing light. Then he turns to Rachel. \nSTEPHAN Breathe. \nHe stands. Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing too, his face a mask. Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the other two, walking towards the light. \nAs the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of the bay door, we hear a woman's voice: \nSARAH (V.O) We should never forget how young they were. \nEXT.

Only twenty-five. \nRACHEL'S P.O.V \nSilhouetted against the bright light is a group of waiting MILITARY and MOSSAD DIGNITARIES. Their hands are raised in applause. \nSARAH (V.O.) (CONT'D) Despite their youth they'd had the courage to confront an unimaginable evil.... \nThe three walk towards their welcoming party. Rachel blinks against the sunlight, takes out a pair of sunglasses and slips them on. \n2   OMITTED                                                       2 \n3   INT. FUNCTION ROOM. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - DAY                 3 \nCLOSE ON OLDER RACHEL \n...now 56. Handsome, impeccably groomed. A long crooked SCAR runs down one side of her face. \nSARAH (O.S) ...a man whose sadistic experiments left thousands disfigured or dead, who became known by a name which defiles the annals of medicine: The Surgeon of Birkenau. \nShe's wearing tinted glasses, staring at us, listening to Sarah speak. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   3. \nREVERSE \nRachel's daughter - SARAH - stands at a podium, reading the Dedication to a rather large audience who have come for the launch of her first book. \nShe's 31, and clearly her mother's daughter. \nThe cover image from the book is projected on a screen behind Sarah - a black and white photograph of a young Rachel, David and Stephan. Above their faces, the title - In Our Hands. \nSARAH Their mission had been to return him to Israel to stand trial. Instead it ended with his death on the streets of East Berlin... \nCUT TO: \n4   EXT. MILITARY AIRBASE. ISRAEL - DAY - THE PAST                4 \nCLOSE ON YOUNG RACHEL \n...as she waits behind David and Stephan, face bleached out by the sunlight. She stares at the ground. \nSARAH (V.O.) But this was not what was celebrated. It was their youth itself that became a symbol. Here were the children who had faced Israel's greatest nightmare, her greatest pain... David and Stephan have moved out of shot and Rachel reaches the DIGNITARIES. Still looking down, she manages a smile, a bob of her head, reaches out to shake the first hand... \n5   INT.

HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - NIGHT                    12 \nA celebratory dinner for the book launch is in progress - publishers, journalists, local dignitaries... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   7. \nRachel is re-joining the table, taking her place beside her daughter amidst the dinner party chatter. Sarah watches her. \nSARAH When are you going to stop? \nRACHEL Stop what? \nSARAH The smoking. \nRACHEL Soon. \nSARAH I hope so. Do it for your grandson. \nSARAH Are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow? \nRACHEL It's all arranged, I'm afraid... \nSARAH But we'll have breakfast before you go? I thought maybe we could take a walk on the beach? (Trying to sound casual) I'd like you to see more of him. \nA WAITER leans over with WINE for Rachel. She covers her glass. RACHEL (To Sarah, ill-at-ease) Well, I'll be back. We can...maybe in the holidays or... \nMIRIAM, a PUBLISHER appears at her shoulder with a copy of Sarah's book. \nMIRIAM I've marked the place. I thought perhaps from chapter eleven...? \nRACHEL ...Yes, thank you. \nRachel nods absently, flicking through the pages of the book. Sarah realizes, with a small stab of pain, that she has no idea what that means. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   8. \nSARAH If you'd rather read something else, mother..... \nRACHEL No, that's fine. \nRachel is barely listening. She is staring at a black and white photograph in the book. \nWe see that the photograph is of a YOUNG MAN in NAZI UNIFORM. It's titled: DIETER VOGEL, \"The Surgeon of Birkenau.\" \nMIRIAM You must be very proud. \nRachel looks up at her, realizes what Miriam is talking about. RACHEL (A little automatic) ...It's a wonderful achievement. I'm very proud of her. \nMIRIAM And I'm sure you were invaluable in the research. \nSARAH (Keeping it light) Actually, my mother withstood all interrogation. My father was the talker. (Trying a joke) I'm the only journalist in Israel she won't speak to. \nMiriam laughs obligingly but Sarah instantly regrets the remark. \nThere is a sudden excited MURMUR from the table. The women look over to where Stephan approaches the table. He is in a motorised WHEELCHAIR. The Mossad Agent attends discreetly in the background. \nRachel's face hardens. \nRACHEL I thought he couldn't come. \nSARAH (Standing up, surprised) So did I. \nSeveral of the local POLITICOS have stood up to greet Stephan, who is all smiles and handshakes. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   9. \nSTEPHAN (To the politicos) Please, sit, sit. My God, it must be election season. \nThere's good-natured laughter from the table. Sarah joins her father, kissing his cheek. \nSARAH You came. \nSTEPHAN I came. So you're the famous author I've heard so much about? \nRachel watches as he takes a place at the table, picks up a copy of the book and examines the cover photograph, holding his glasses a little from his eyes to focus. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) (Without looking) Rachel. \nRACHEL Stephan. \nSTEPHAN (To Sarah) Now you're the expert, maybe you could tell me something. (Pointing to himself) Who's this handsome devil on the cover? \nMore polite laughter from the table. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) It went well? \nSARAH'S HUSBAND She was wonderful. \nSTEPHAN That's good. Good, good. That's very good. \nRachel takes a sip of water and notices Stephen's hands, crumbling some bread - they're SHAKING. \nShe looks up at his face, reads the hidden STRAIN there. \nHe senses her gaze and meets it, and for a second his smile falters and SOMETHING LIKE PANIC flickers in his eyes. \n24    INT/EXT. STEPHEN'S CAR. TEL AVIV - NIGHT                      24 Stephan and Rachel sit in the back of the car. Behind a screen the young Mossad Agent we saw earlier sits in the front next to the Driver. Tel Aviv races by in neon smears. \nThe air is charged with tension. \nRACHEL (Of the driver) He's driving too fast. \nStephan ignores her. She turns to the window, watches as they streak past another car. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) This is ridiculous. What's so important? Tell me where we're going? \nSTEPHAN We're going to David's apartment. \nRachel turns to him, startled. \nRACHEL David...? \nSTEPHAN I keep track of people Rachel. It's my job. (Beat) I know he came to see you yesterday. \nRACHEL (contemptuous) What's this? The jealous ex- husband or the intelligence officer? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    14. \nSTEPHAN A little of both. What did he want? \nRACHEL Fuck you. \nSTEPHAN What did he tell you? \nSomething about his intensity unnerves her. \nRACHEL He didn't tell me anything. (Off his look) He didn't! He told me where he'd been travelling, that he'd been teaching... We spoke for a few minutes and then I had to go. \nStephan is still staring at her, reading her. RACHEL (CONT'D) (Bristling) If you don't believe me ask him yourself. \nAnd then he can't keep it from his face - and she knows. Something terrible has happened. \n25    INT. LIVING ROOM. DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                   25 \nStephan sits in the middle of the squalid living room, lost in thought. \n26    BEDROOM                                                       26 \nRachel walks slowly though the room, taking it all in - the little islands of occupation, the places where David sat, read, slept. Piles of newspapers. Used cups. A mound of laundry... \nON Rachel as she looks about her, looking for something, some sign from the man she knew. But there's nothing personal here. These are the rooms of a man who had no real home. \n27    BATHROOM                                                      27 \nRachel walks in and switches on the light. She stares around the dirty bathroom. \nCUT TO: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    15. \n28    CLOSE ON YOUNG DAVID                                          28 \n...turning to face us, the beautiful smile... \nCUT TO: \n29    BACK ON OLDER RACHEL                                          29 \n...as she begins to cry. \n30    LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                      30 \nStephan sits listening to her breaking down. \n31    LIVING ROOM - LATER                                           31 \nRachel sits on the couch. RACHEL Why did he do it? \nStephan looks at her, considering. \nHe takes out a sheet of PRINTED PAPER, hands it to her. She reads some of the first page, then looks up at him. \nAnd now we see it on her face too. Fear. \n32    EXT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              32 \nThe Mossad Agent sits on the stairs, smoking. As the door behind him opens he stands aside and watches Rachel SWEEP past him down the stairs, without giving him a glance. \n33    INT. RACHEL'S HOTEL - NIGHT                                   33 \nRachel is packing, folding clothes neatly, precisely, silently - all the time a terrible tension in her movements. \nShe tries to close a drawer but it sticks, She keeps trying, then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free and hurls it across the room. \nShe stands breathing hard. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    16. \n34    EXT. PATIO TERRACE/BEACH. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - DAY           34 \nThe next day. Tables under umbrellas are ranged along the terrace. \nSarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with their son, laughing. As if feeling our gaze, she looks up at us, shielding her eyes against the sun. \n44    INT/EXT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                      44 \nA brief glimpse of the couple climbing the winding stairs - a view we have seen before. \n45    INT. EAST BERLIN - SAFE HOUSE. DAY                            45 \nThe place looks like a squat. \nYOUNG Stephan sits playing idly at a battered old upright piano, a cigarette in his mouth. He looks up as David and Rachel walk in and stand framed in the doorway, looking every inch the young married couple. Stephan looks at them for a beat, then starts to play the first few bars of Mendelssohn's wedding march. \nThe other two blush furiously, not amused. Rachel takes her case from David. \nRACHEL Where do I sleep? \nSTEPHAN You're in my room. \nHe waits just long enough to enjoy her reaction. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) I'm moving in with him. (Beat) You're at the end there. \nShe nods and walks off. \n46    INT. KITCHEN - LATER                                          46 Stephan is smoking. David sits at the table. He is using a file to create a notch at the bottom of a thin strip of sprung steel. \nBoth men can hear the BATH RUNNING in the bathroom, both very aware of this new female presence in the house they've been sharing together for the last month. \nSTEPHAN What do you think of your new wife? \nDavid frowns at the steel strip, seeming preoccupied. \nDAVID Too young. \nStephan watches him, amused. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   20. \nSTEPHAN Pretty. \nDavid shrugs. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) You didn't notice. \nHe begins to sort his possessions out. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) You know what I've noticed? You don't notice women. I've noticed that. How long have I known you? \nDAVID (examining the steel) I don't know. \nSTEPHAN Two years. All the places we've been to. You don't look at women. Before I get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me? \nDavid sighs, blows on the steel strip and holds it up for Stephan to examine. \nWe hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse of Rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door heading for her room. The two men watch her pass. Stephan turns and catches David's expression. \nSTEPHAN Well, well...I think he just noticed. \nCUT TO: \n47    INT. SAFE HOUSE - RACHEL'S ROOM - NIGHT                      47 \nRachel sits on her bed drying her hair. She stops, listening to the indistinct murmur of the men's voices from the room next door. Rachel leans towards the wall, trying to hear more but the voices fall silent. \n48    INT. SAFEHOUSE - MORNING                                     48 \nDavid, holding a kitchen knife, MOVES TO STAB Stephan. \nStephan uses a krav magah move to disarm him. The knife clatters to the floor as he twists David's arm behind his back. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    21. \nThere's an element of showing off and Stephan uses a little more force than is necessary. David winces but doesn't say anything. \nStephan turns to Rachel who has been watching. \nSTEPHAN Yes? \nRachel nods and they change places. David picks up the knife and repeats the \"attack\" move on her. She disarms him easily. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) Now an attack from behind. \nDavid takes his position, grabbing Rachel from behind, but he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little tentative. \nStephan talks as Rachel practises breaking free from the hold. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) Where have you come from? \nRACHEL Argentina. \nSTEPHAN Really? Whereabouts? \nRACHEL Cordoba. \nSTEPHAN What were you doing there? \nRACHEL My husband is an Industrial Chemist. \nShe reaches the chair and climbs onto it. A pause and then, tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging the gown to cover herself as best she can. \nShe tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the ceiling. A bright LIGHT shines down on her. \nWe hear footsteps approach. \nRachel closes her eyes. VOGEL Good morning, Frau Roget. I'm Doctor Bernhardt. \nRachel opens her eyes. Vogel is sitting on a small stool, taking a speculum from the tray of instruments, his back to us. \nRACHEL Good morning, doctor. \nHe turns and smiles at us - and he has a wonderful, warm smile, the air of a gruff but kindly Uncle. \nVOGEL Alright now, just relax. We're going to do a little examination. If you feel at all uncomfortable, you just say. Alright? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   25. \nShe manages to nod. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) Alright, this is my hand... and this is the speculum. It's going to feel cold. \nRachel reacts as Vogel pushes the speculum into place, opens it and begins the examination. She stares up into the light. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) Can I ask how old you are? \nRACHEL Twenty five. \nVOGEL And how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby? RACHEL Nearly two years. \nVOGEL Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look fine. Alright, let's see... your cervix is slightly retroverted. Tilted backwards? \nRachel raises her hand to her LOCKET NECKLACE and begins to fiddle with it. \nRACHEL Really? The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE. \nVOGEL Mmm. But that generally shouldn't affect fertility. \nRACHEL Oh, good. \nVOGEL You have a slight accent, Frau Roget. Where are you from? \nRACHEL Argentina. We just moved here... A few months ago. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    26. \nVOGEL Whereabouts in Argentina? Buenos Aires? \nHe looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand away from the locket. She finds herself nodding. \nVogel looks away again. Rachel bites down on a wave of panic. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) Oh, Buenos Aires. Beautiful. I went once, when I was young. We went to the Opera house I remember. What's it called again? \nRachel stares at the light. Beat. \nRACHEL Teatro Colon. He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile. \nVOGEL That's right. Beautiful. This might sting a little, dear. \nRachel winces. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Now, there's a couple of tests we need to run, make sure there are no problems. Is that alright? \nRachel nods. He pats her hand. VOGEL (CONT'D) Brave girl. \n57    EXT. CLINIC - DAY                                             57 \nRachel walks out and finds David waiting, smoking. He takes her hand and they walk off without speaking. \n58    EXT. QUIET STREET - DAY                                       58 \nThe two turn the corner, out of sight of the clinic. David glances at her. She looks pale, shaken. He feels a wave of sudden tenderness for her, opens his mouth to say something then catches himself. \nCLOSE on their hands. After a moment David LETS GO. They walk on. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   27. \n59    INT. BAR - DAY                                               59 \nStephan sits at a table. Rachel and David appear beside him and join him. There is an awkward silence for a moment. Stephan sips his coffee. \nSTEPHAN (in German) So. Everything...? \nRACHEL (in German, abruptly) Next appointment is on Wednesday. \nShe looks at David but he is staring at the table. Like Stephan he is uncomfortable with the thought of what Rachel has been through. \nShe takes his hand. He looks up, surprised, searches her face... But then Rachel lets go and walks off towards the toilets. \nDavid looks down at the SILVER LOCKET lying in his palm. \n60    EXT. STREET - DAY                                            60 \nStephan walks down the street. A SMARTLY DRESSED MAN walks towards him, absently jingling his CAR KEYS in his hand. \nAs he nears Stephan, the man fumbles the keys and they drop. Stephan dips down to pick them up and hands them back to the man with a smile. \n73    INT. LIVING ROOM. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - EVENING                73 \nRachel runs the hem of a partially-made WHITE GARMENT through a SEWING MACHINE. She finishes and takes it over to where Stephan stands waiting. It's unfinished, but a fairly good approximation of a MEDIC'S WHITE COAT. \nRACHEL Try this on. \nStephan puts it on. She tugs at the coat, straightens the unfinished collar, runs her hands down the front to smooth it out. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) (re: the coat) How does it feel? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   31. \nSTEPHAN (Flirting) Nice. \nRachel ignores this, begins to pin the cuff of one of the sleeves. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) Here you are, Mossad agent, all those years of training, the highest levels of marksmanship and krav magah, first big mission...sewing. \nRachel resists a smile, brandishes the pin. \nRACHEL Black belt in dressmaking. \nHe holds up his hands in surrender. STEPHAN I never argue with an armed woman. \n74    INT. KITCHEN. SAFEHOUSE - LATER                              74 \nRachel and Stephan sit as David serves the dinner. Rachel examines her dish. \nRACHEL (Politely) What is it? \nDAVID (Beat) It doesn't have a name. \nStephan tastes his. \nSTEPHAN (Grimacing) Shit. \nDavid lifts his spoon, blows on it. \nDAVID (Solemn) Now it does. \nThey laugh a little, settle into eating. \nDavid stares at his bowl, deciding whether or not to say something. Finally... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   32. \nDAVID (CONT'D) It's my birthday. \nThey look up at him in surprise. \n75    INT. BAR - LATER                                             75 \nTinny music plays. \nThe place is almost empty. In the back of the bar the three sit in a corner drinking beer - just young people, laughing, a little drunk. They could be students. \nRachel is reciting something from memory. \nRACHEL Uh, at ten - study the Mishnah, at fifteen - study the Talmud. By eighteen - stand under the wedding canopy... STEPHAN We're too late for all of those. \nThey laugh. \nRACHEL Uh...twenty. In your twenties you are to \"pursue your life's goals.\" \nSTEPHAN (Flirtatious) What are you pursuing Rachel? Rachel thinks about it, shrugs. \nRACHEL I don't know. I'm waiting to find out. \nSTEPHAN (smiles to himself) Youth... \nRACHEL What about you, grandfather? Have you got a goal? \nSTEPHAN (Smiling) Oh yes. We believe in goals in my family. We're very driven men. My father was Director of Collections by the time he was fifty. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   33. \nRACHEL So what's your goal? \nSTEPHAN Director of Collections by forty. \nThey laugh. \nRACHEL (To David) What about you David. What \"life goal\" are you pursuing? \nDavid smiles, stares at his drink. \nDAVID This is it. \nRachel laughs, looks around at their less than glamorous surroundings. RACHEL This is it? This is all you want? \nDavid laughs. He would obviously rather change the subject but Rachel is a little drunk, a little curious. \nRACHEL Seriously, what do you want out of life? \nDAVID (Beat, shrugs) I want this. I want to get Vogel. I want him to be put on trial and I want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did. I want them all to know the truth. \nHe looks up at their faces, embarrassed at having darkened the atmosphere. \nThe AMBULANCE speeds on. \n93    EXT. STREET NEAR CLINIC - CONTINUOUS                         93 Stephan pulls back some rusty doors. \nParked in the small courtyard beyond is the van we saw before, now decorated with AMBULANCE DECALS and LIGHTS.

Stephan crouches down beside Vogel and takes his pulse. \nSTEPHAN We need to take him to the hospital. He and David open up the stretcher and transfer Vogel to it with some efficiency. \nNURSE Oh God! \nSTEPHAN He's going to be alright. \nRachel and the nurse follow David and Stephan as they carry the stretcher out through the waiting room. \n100    INT.

I want to travel with him. \nDAVID Not possible I'm afraid. New regulations. \nWe begin to register that the siren is growing louder with every second. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   44. \nAs Stephan and David carry the stretcher down the stairs, Rachel takes the nurse's hand to detain her. \nRACHEL Don't worry, he's in good hands now.

COURTYARD/STREET NEAR CLINIC - LATE AFTERNOON           102 \nThe DEUTSCHE POST VAN that David and Stephan stole earlier pulls out into the street.

BACK OF VAN - MOMENTS LATER                             104 \nThe winter evening is gathering outside. David and Rachel are in the back of the van. David has taken off the white coat. David checks his watch. \nSTEPHAN (Tense) I know, I know. \nHe accelerates. \nRachel grabs hold of the back of the seat to avoid falling. She looks down at the stretcher - Vogel lies unconscious.

DEUTSCHE POST DEPOT - NIGHT                             105 \nShe watches in dismay as the van heads for the exit. \nSuddenly it brakes... \nIN THE VAN \nStephan throws the gear into reverse.. \nON RACHEL \nand the van begins to reverse with a scream of tyres towards Rachel. \nThe Guards at the side-gate open fire on the van hurtling towards them, bullets pocking the rear doors. \nThe side door is flung open and Rachel dives in, just as Stephan roars forward again. \n128B    INT.

ROAD NEAR STATION - NIGHT                               129 \nSTEPHAN'S P.O.V \nOn the road ahead a Border Guard Jeep appears, driving directly towards them. \nStephan has no choice - he floors it. \nAt the last second the jeep tries to pull right but the van catches its rear side and barrels straight through, the jeep spinning off and smashing into the wall. \n130     IN THE VAN                                                   130 \nStephan fights to keep the van under control, screeches into a turn and off down the road. \nSTEPHAN Is he dead? (Beat) Is he dead? \nRACHEL Who? \nSTEPHAN The Guard! The one who saw your face! Is he dead? RACHEL No. \nStephen's grim silence says everything. He glances back at the unconscious Vogel lying between the other two. \nSTEPHAN How did he come round? How the fuck did he come round? You gave him the full injection? \nRachel hesitates. \nSTEPHAN Did you give him the... \nRACHEL I don't know! I thought I... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   55. \nSTEPHAN Jesus Christ! \nStephan can't believe it's all fallen apart so quickly. \nSTEPHAN We could have gone! \nDAVID It's not over. \nSTEPHEN We could have fucking...! \nDAVID WE STILL HAVE HIM! IT'S NOT OVER! We still have him. \nStephan glares at David but doesn't say anything. The van roars on. \n131    INT. SAFE HOUSE. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                            131 \nRachel sits on the floor looking towards the living room, staring at something. \nRACHEL'S P.O.V \n...three POTS have been placed under drips from the ceiling inside the room. We hear the three distinct notes of the water drops. \nRachel stares dully at the water dripping, feeling exhausted and numb. A key scrapes and Rachel turns to the door as Stephan and David walk in, hair soaked from the rain. \nRACHEL (Standing up) What did he say? \nStephan stalks past, ignoring her. \nRACHEL You made contact? \nDavid nods. David looks after Stephan who's walked on into the living room in grim silence. \nDAVID So...so what does that mean? \nRACHEL Oh God... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   65. \nSTEPHAN Did you feed him? \nDAVID What does that mean? What's the plan now? \nRACHEL (rising panic) We just need to get him to the airfield, there must be some other way, some... \nStephan starts down the hallway towards her, angry. \nSTEPHAN I said has he...? \nDavid instinctively steps in front of Rachel, raises a hand. DAVID (overlapping) I'm asking you... \nSTEPHAN (overlapping) I'm talking to her! Supposedly it's her shift now, but instead of doing what she's supposed to be doing she's out here with you! (To Rachel) Now answer the fucking question: Did you feed him? \nRACHEL YES! I fed him! \nStephan stands glaring at her, then turns abruptly away. \nSTEPHAN (Beat) There's no plan. There's no fucking plan. They said the operation is being \"re- evaluated.\" \nHe turns to David. \nSTEPHAN You know what that means? They're going to cut us loose. \nThey stare at him shocked. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   66. \nSTEPHAN It's a fucking mess and they're backing away from it quickly as they can. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) (Beat) No. \nSTEPHAN It's happening. I can feel it. \nRACHEL They can't just leave us! \nSTEPHAN Yes they can! Because we fucked it all up! We fucked it all up and now we're on our own! \nSuddenly we hear someone KNOCKING on the front door. The three FREEZE, staring at each other. Silence. \nDAVID Were you followed? \nStephan stares at the door, thrown. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Could you have been...? \nThere is another KNOCK at the door. Stephan turns to the chest of drawers and takes out the GUN. \nRACHEL Stephan? Stephan is hurriedly screwing the SILENCER onto the GUN. There's another KNOCK at the door. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Stephan! \nStephan walks into the living room and aims the gun at Vogel. Vogel instinctively squirms away, falling to one side, wriggling back as far as he can. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nSTEPHAN If it's them, he dies. \nVogel lies, breathing hard through his nose, eyes on the gun aimed at him. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    67. \nDavid suddenly steps in between the two, the gun now pointing at his chest. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) Move. \nDAVID You're not doing this. \nSTEPHAN He's not getting away from me. \nDAVID This isn't the mission. \nSTEPHAN I decide what the mission is! If I say he dies, he dies. \nDAVID We're finishing this mission. We're taking him back. \nSTEPHAN Get out of the way! \nThere is another KNOCK at the door. David and Stephan stare at each other, the tension building. Abruptly Rachel turns and walks down the hallway towards the door. Stephan calls after her. \nSTEPHAN Rachel. Rachel! \nFrom the hallway we hear the sound of the door being opened - the murmur of conversation. The two men stand frozen, listening. Vogel lies, breathing hard through his nose. \nWe hear the door close. The three listen as footsteps approach down the hall... \nRachel walks back in. A long beat. \nRACHEL (Dully) It was the lady from the bottom apartment. She invited us to her New Year's Eve party. \nShe turns and walks back out. The others stay where they are, frozen. \nDAVID She wants to go out. \nRACHEL (appealing) No one will see me. Tell him, David. I just want to walk. I just want to get some...air. Please. \nStephan shakes his head. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    71. \nRachel tries to unlock the door, but David has hold of it. She struggles against him. \nSTEPHAN Don't be stupid. \nHe takes her arm. Rachel jerks free. \nRACHEL GET OFF ME! \nThen she slumps against the door, her back to them. She's crying brokenly. \nA beat as the two men stand over her, not attempting to comfort her any further. \nStephan turns and walks away. \nDavid leans his head against the door, waiting for her to stop. \n160    INT. SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM. EVENING.                        160 \nIt's raining heavily outside and water is dripping through the cracks in the ceiling. \nDavid kneels next to VOGEL with a bowl of oatmeal and strips the tape from his mouth. \nVOGEL Thank you. David. \nDavid doesn't react. Vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls, watching David, his mood strange. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) David and Stephan and Rachel... \nHe gives a soft laugh, finding something amusing in the sound of the names. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) If I had a choice I'd prefer Rachel to feed me. So gentle...in another life, the makings of a Nurse, I think...in another life... \nDavid continues to feed, careful to appear immune to Vogel. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) How is she today? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   72. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) You should let her get more rest. It's a dangerous time, the first month or two of the pregnancy. \nDavid stares at him, unable to hide his shock. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) (Beat) You didn't know? \nVogel absorbs this thoughtfully. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) You're not the father then? (Beat)I thought it would be you. I thought...I don't know. The way you look at her. The way she looks at you... \nDavid stirs the oatmeal, trying to think about what he's just discovered. Vogel doesn't take his eyes off him... \nVOGEL (CONT'D) Women can be like that, they like to make you dance first, I remember. (As though to himself) So, she chose the other one...? \nHe shakes his head, shrugs. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) That must be hard, watching them together, right in front of you. And you not saying a word. Like the Poet says - \"Great souls suffer in silence.\" I wouldn't have taken Stephan as a family man. Too ambitious, too...? Whereas you? David, I see you with children... \nDAVID (Quietly) Shut up. \nVogel stares at him. This is the first time someone has spoken to him in weeks. He's quick to hide his sense of triumph. \nVOGEL I am expressing my sympathy. For your suffering. \nDAVID What does a monster like you know about suffering? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   73. \nVOGEL I'm a doctor, David. \nDavid stares at him. \nDAVID A doctor. (beat)You blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes. You inject people with petrol. You...you replace people's hands and legs and you watch as they... \nHe stops himself. \nDAVID (CONT'D) This isn't medicine. This is disease. This is sickness. \nVogel seems to consider this. VOGEL So we were all insane? Is that the answer? \nDAVID (Beat) There's no answer. I'm not looking for an answer. I'm not looking for... \nHe forces himself to be silent, tries to regain control of himself. He offers Vogel another spoonful, but his hand trembles a little with the violence of his emotions. \nVOGEL You're trembling. \nDavid pushes the spoon into Vogel's mouth, starts to load another spoonful. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) It's strange. Here I am - the victim, kidnapped, bound, soon to be murdered, but I think you are the one that is afraid, David. (Beat) Afraid of the monster. \nHe leans closer to David. \n165    INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT.                                         165 \nRachel lies motionless. We wait for her to cough as we saw her do before. But she doesn't. She just continues to lie still. \n166    EXT. STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS                                   166 \nBelow us Vogel clatters on down the stairs, flight after flight. \n167    INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                     167 \nNo movement from Rachel. \n168    EXT. STAIRWELL/COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS                         168 \nVogel clears the stairs and bursts into the courtyard. There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a moment we see Vogel lit, as he passes the point where earlier we saw him drop to the ground. \nHe reaches the gate and goes through, his shadow disappearing on the pavement. \nHe's gone. \n169    INT. BERLIN SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT                    169 \nRachel holds a blood-soaked tea towel to her cheek, trying to staunch the flow. David sits, staring ahead, in shock. \nStephan bursts in, out of breath. \nSTEPHAN Nothing. Not a trace. Nothing at all. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   78. \nHe hurries to the drawers and takes out the gun, puts it into his waistband. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) He might go to the house, might try and get a message to the wife... \nDAVID (Without looking up) He's not going back to the house. He's gone. Fifteen years, it took them to find him. And he's gone. And no-one's going to find him again. \nSTEPHAN So we what? We...are you going to make the phone call? Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl? Wonderful. But don't try and take me down with you. I've done nothing wrong. Remember that! \nStephan kicks at the chair, at the drawers. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) (muttering tensely) This can't happen! This is never going to go away. \nRACHEL I take responsibility. It was my shift. DAVID (Quietly) This happened because of me. I let him go. And no-one's ever going to find him again. \nHe closes his eyes, struggling with the enormity of his guilt. \nStephan drops the gun onto the table, sits down. Outside we hear more fireworks. Suddenly... \nSTEPHAN No-one's ever going to find him again. \nSomething in his voice causes Rachel to look up at him. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) (Beat) What if he didn't escape? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   79. \nRACHEL What are you talking about? \nSTEPHAN Only four people know what happened in this room. Us, and him. And he's not talking. No one will ever hear from him again. \nRACHEL (Realizing what he means) No. \nSTEPHAN Nobody needs to know what happened here. \nRACHEL He escaped. STEPHAN That's the truth. But that doesn't have to be the truth we take home. The truth can be anything we want it to be. The truth is Vogel tried to escape, you struggled with him and got hurt. The truth is, seconds before he got away, Rachel got the gun and shot him. The truth is we got rid of him.... got rid of the body... got rid of every trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau. \nRACHEL We can't lie about this! \nSTEPHAN No, you know what? We have to. We have to! This is...this isn't about us. This is about Israel. This is a national humiliation! We can't be seen to fail. And in the end, Vogel rots away his life in some jungle, looking over his shoulder, waiting for the bullet...? Who's to say...? \nHe looks at them both, trying to convince them, trying to convince himself. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) Maybe that's a worse fate. Maybe that's...The important thing is justice... justice is seen to be done! FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    80. \nRachel turns to David, waiting, expecting him to say something. But David looks like he's been barely listening, lost in his own thoughts. He notices Rachel staring at him. \nDAVID He's gone. What does it matter?(Beat) He's gone. \nStephan seizes on this, sensing he's close to convincing them. \nSTEPHAN (Seizing ) He's right. It makes no difference. No difference. All we have to agree is that we never talk about this. No matter what happens, we never tell anyone. The truth stays in this room. Between us. Agreed? Rachel looks at David again, wanting some kind of sign. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) (To Rachel) Agreed? Say it. (Silence) I need to hear you say it! \nShe's still staring at David. He's still avoiding her gaze. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) (To Rachel) Say it. Say... \nDAVID Agreed. Silence. Rachel closes her eyes. Instead of relief she feels a kind of immense disappointment. \nRACHEL David...? \nSTEPHAN Rachel? Say it. It's an oath. Say it. \nWe CLOSE on Rachel. The moment that will change her life forever. \nRachel is packing, folding clothes neatly, precisely, silently - but all the time there's a terrible tension about her movements. \nShe tries to close a drawer but it sticks, She keeps trying, then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free and hurls it across the room. \nShe stands breathing hard. \nThen something we didn't see - her gaze settles on a photograph beside her table - SARAH holding her son, smiling at us. \nRachel stares at the photograph, her breathing slowing. \n174    EXT. PATIO TERRACE. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - DAY                174 \nStephan sits amongst the remains of a meal. Sarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with their son. \nStephan watches them. He senses a presence and turns to find Rachel behind him. She sits down, stares down at the beach through her dark glasses. \nStephan watches, almost holding his breath, working through lightning calculations of how to handle her. But Rachel is the first to speak. \nRACHEL (Beat) I always knew this would happen. I knew we'd be punished. I knew we'd have to pay. \nSTEPHAN (Quietly) I thought I'd already been punished. \nRACHEL God doesn't plant car bombs. \nSTEPHAN I wasn't referring to the wheelchair. \nThey look at each other. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) If I could go back, Rachel, I'd change it all. If I could give you back a chance to be happy, to be... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   85. \nHe stops. She is staring back at him coldly, unmoved. He shrugs, letting that go. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) But there's one thing I would never change. \nShe looks over to where Sarah is playing with her son, laughing. \nRACHEL (Instantly) She isn't going to find out. \nShe shakes her head, as if the idea itself were impossible. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) She can never find out. \nStephan stares at her, KNOWING THAT HE HAS HER, that it's already decided. He takes out the envelope and slides it across the table towards her. She examines the ticket and passports inside. Then he slides her the BLACK CASE. We've seen this part of the scene before. \nShe stares at it with disgust, knowing what it is. Then she takes it and puts it in her handbag. \nSTEPHAN My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport. \nShe stands up, an elegant woman at lunch, her dark glasses, her suit... She looks down to Sarah, raises a hand in farewell. \nSarah, not understanding, waves a hand in response, calls something which is lost under the sound of the sea. \nSTEPHAN (CONT'D) Go down to her. Say goodbye to her. \nRachel stands stock still, staring down at her daughter. \nRACHEL How can I? (Beat.) How can I? \nShe turns and walks away.

An IV drip hangs on a stand, its tube running into a cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the chair. \nThe only sound is the faint, rasping breath of the man. \nRachel moves a little closer. On the bottom of the bed hangs a medical chart. The name reads Ivan Schevchuk. \nRachel moves closer, carefully taking the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE from her pocket. \n221     INT.

Rachel walks out of the bathroom and into her bedroom, for a moment the three criss-crossing each other's paths. Rachel's bedroom door closes. Both men avoid looking at each other as they pass it. \n140    HALLWAY - MORNING                                            140 \nStephan and David are carrying a struggling, cursing Vogel towards the bathroom. \nBefore they can get there Vogel pisses himself, the urine puddling on the floor at their feet. \nSTEPHAN Fuck! \nStephan drops Vogel in disgust jumping back out of the way.

SAFEHOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY                            143 \nVogel leans against the wall, staring blankly at the window, sunk into a profound depression. He looks filthy, jaw dark with beard growth. \nRachel watches him from the doorway. \n144    LATER                                                        144 \nRachel is washing Vogel's face with a towel.

She produces a RAZOR and carefully begins to shave his cheeks. \nShe stops suddenly, a TEAR is running down Vogel's cheek, cutting a line through the soap. He turns his eyes to her. \nVOGEL Why don't you just kill me now? \nRachel pauses for a moment. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) How can you keep me waiting to die like this! \nRachel keeps on shaving. \nVOGEL I know what you want. You want to hand me over to the others, let there be some fucking sham of a trial. Then, when they kill me, you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands. \nRachel switches to the other cheek. Vogel's getting more animated, tears in his eyes, a kind of bizarre indignation... \nVOGEL (CONT'D) But that isn't true. There will be blood on your hands.

You want to do it... \nRachel finishes with a trembling hand. \nVogel slumps back against the wall, the tension in his body easing away. He gives her a long, calculating look. \nAnd as we watch some CHANGE seems to come over him, some new fire beginning to kindle in him - a sense of cold contempt for Rachel and with it, perhaps, a fresh determination to survive this. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) That's right. I'd forgotten. You Jews never knew how to kill. Only how to die. \nRachel wipes the razor clean on the towel, SLAPS fresh tape onto Vogel's mouth and gets up. \n145    INT.

Vogel wakes, breathes out, watches her. After a moment... VOGEL I was dreaming about my wife. \nShe feeds him some more. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) One of the great regrets of my life is that we were unable to have children. My wife would have made a wonderful mother. \nVogel watches her, then suddenly SPEAKS IN ENGLISH... \nVOGEL (CONT'D) It's a great blessing. Rachel stares at him. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) You should try lemons. For the morning sickness. \nRachel can't move. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) They say it helps. \nRachel struggles to hold it together, feeds him another spoonful. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) What's your name? (Beat) Sarah? Hannah?...Rachel? Esther? (Beat) You Jews stay close to your roots, don't you? It's a good thing. Very good.

Higher justice. \nRachel shovels in another mouthful. He chews it thoughtfully, examines her face. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) Yes. I understand you perfectly. (Beat) You weren't lying at the clinic when you told me about your mother were you? About her death? \nRachel loads the spoon with more oatmeal, determined not to show any emotion. \nVOGEL (CONT'D) I'm very sorry for your loss. It almost takes her breath away. She tears the tape and puts it over his mouth, gets up and walks away, determined not to show him any emotion. \nVogel watches her go. \n149    HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER                                      149 \nRachel makes it out into the hallway before she feels the tears running down her face. She gives in to them, turns and finds David behind her. \nDAVID What happened? What's the matter? \nShe can't speak at first. \nRACHEL Nothing. He...nothing. \nShe wipes her face. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) He can understand us. \nDAVID What? \nRACHEL He can understand every word we're saying. He just spoke to me.

It's nearly over. \nHe pulls her close, holds her, rests his forehead against hers. They stand like that, eyes closed. The moment hangs. \nRACHEL (Suddenly) Why didn't you go? At the station. You could have got away. Why didn't you? \nShe looks up at him. He stares into her eyes. Beat. Then, suddenly he kisses her. It's what she's waited so long for and she's stunned for a moment, then puts her arms around his neck, returning the kiss hungrily. They are helpless with desire for one another. There is a sudden scratch of a key at the front door and, instinctively, the two break apart. \nStephan enters, hair wet from the rain. He stops, seeing them, sensing the atmosphere. They stare back at him. Rachel steps away a little, wiping her face. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) What did they say? \nStephan stares at them in silence. He unbuttons his coat. \nDAVID Stephan? STEPHAN It's not happening. \nThey stare at him aghast - this is the last thing they wanted to hear. \nDAVID What the fuck does that mean? \nSTEPHAN The Americans have pulled out.

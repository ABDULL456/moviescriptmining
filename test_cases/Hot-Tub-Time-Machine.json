{"test1_input": "Adam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest, well-kept suburban home, as a recovered, dressed, embarrassed and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag. They both stop 10 yards short of a RANGE ROVER, where the black man, NICK, waits in the car, waving. \nLILY I can't wait for you to come back and marry me. Wow, that's crazy. Adam looks almost like it just hit him. \nADAM Yeah. \n(REALIZATION) Wow. \nLILY Tell me again I have nothing to worry about. \nADAM Babe, look at Nick... In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio. \nADAM (CONT'D) You think with him in charge, we're gonna get into any kind of trouble? We'll probably eat too much pizza and I'll twist my ankle getting off the ski lift. \nLILY OK. Have an awesome bachelor party. Not too awesome. (hands him bag) I got you something. Adam looks in the bag. \nADAM Sandwich. Thanks. He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her. \nLILY Let me see your phone. He takes it out. \nADAM I told you, I'll call you when-- She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as she pockets the phone. \nLILY Despite my anxiety, I'm not gonna be one of those women who wants an update every ten minutes. Even though I do want an update every ten minutes. Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious. \nLILY (CONT'D) Just make sure whatever happens, you're back for the rehearsal dinner. \n(SHOWING CONCERN) I totally trust you. \nADAM You should. I'm a lame-o. \nLILY Well at least you're a cute lame-o. Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a disgusting display of affection. A FLASH goes off. From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone. \nNICK I'm more than willing to forget about earlier, but this shit's going on Facebook. \nINT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING \nNick drives through SUBURBIA, while Adam rides shotgun. \nNICK I have no idea what Facebook is. My phone has a button that says Send To Facebook. I've been sending shit there for months. Adam looks out the window, smiling. \nADAM I'm so psyched about this weekend! \nNICK Ditto, buddy. I'm gonna help you make up for all the good times you missed when you were being a responsible member of society. \nADAM You're a good friend. I'm sorry for putting my career and self sufficiency above bowling night. \nNICK This trip represents everything awesome about being a dude. \n(MORE) \nNICK (CONT'D) We're gonna drink too much, eat whatever we want... \n(FANTASIZING) I might not even change my socks. \nADAM Live the dream. \nNICK Best of all, we don't have to answer to anyone. Nick's PHONE rings and he answers it with his built-in BLUETOOTH. His phone voice is a little more \"sensitive.\" \nNICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Hi honey. \nCOURTNEY (V.0.) Three goddamn bags of pretzels? \nNICK (ON PHONE) (trying to save face) I'm with Adam, honey. \nCOURTNEY (V.0.) Hi Adam. (a little calmer) Nick, what have I told you about buying snacks that aren't on sale? \n", "test1_true": "COURTNEY (V.0.) And what did you do? \nNICK (ON PHONE) I bought three bags of pretzels. But I'm gonna eat them... \nCOURTNEY (V.0.) That's not the point. \n(ADMONISHING) Don't do it again. Nick and Adam exchange an embarrassing glance. \nNICK (ON PHONE) \nOK. \nCOURTNEY (V.0.) Call me from the road. Adam, say hi to Lily. \nADAM (ON PHONE) OK, I sure wi-- CLICK. For a moment, there is an uncomfortable silence. \nADAM (CONT'D) Don't her parents own the supermarket? \nNICK The whole damn chain. \n(THEN) Just be thankful Lily doesn't have any family money. Nothing makes your dick softer. \nEXT. MOTEL -- DAY \nNick's car pulls into the lot of a rundown motel. \nINT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY \nAdam looks confused and slightly nervous. \nADAM This looks like a place where people die. Mostly from murder. A BALD, miserable-looking GUY in his late 30s (LOU) exits a room, carrying TWO SHOPPING BAGS. He gets in the back seat. Adam looks happy to see him. \nADAM (CONT'D) Lou! \nLOU Yes, I'm living in a transient motel. Let's get that purple elephant out of the room. \nADAM Dude, it looks nice. \nLOU Thank you. I hate your guts. \nADAM (re: the bags) What'd you bring? \nLOU All my belongings. \nNICK So you're sorta like a bum now, huh? \nLOU In a sense. \nINT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING \nLou sits in the backseat, voraciously eating a bowl of cereal, as the other guys are up front. \nLOU Our system is fucked, gentlemen. You tell me how a whore wife can fuck some black dude - no offense - and still take her cuckold of a husband for all he's got. \nNICK Why would I take offense to that? \nLOU It's offensive. \nNICK Because he's black? \nLOU And because he's fucking my wife. And because you're black. And because of all the oversensitive horrible garbage... you know what? Forget no offense. Just offense. Are you offended? \nNICK Not really. \nLOU Then shut the fuck up. \n", "test1_id": 2577, "test2_input": "LOU If he doesn't lose that arm soon, I'm gonna take it from him myself. With that, Lou wanders off toward another room, leering at and groping girls as he goes. \nADAM \n(RE: LOU) He's gonna be a problem. Tad and Chaz walk over, looking dapper and douchey. They are excited to see Jacob. \nTAD Hey, glad you could make it! \nADAM \n(ANNOYED) This is your party? \nCHAZ Hey man, no hard feelings, all right? If your bro says you're cool, then we're cool. Tad puts his arm around Jacob and leads him into the party. \nTAD There's some people I want you to meet. By the way, bodacious hair. Incredibly chic. \nJACOB \n(FLATTERED) Oh yeah? It doesn't really take that much product. It's all in the layering. \nTAD Whoa. Product. You're blowing my mind right now. Did you spend time in Europe? \nCHAZ Don't tell me. Prague. Do you want some coke? \nJACOB Do you have Coke Zero? \nTAD Ah, a conscientious objector. I like that. Gotta stay sharp. \nIN THE KITCHEN Nick mixes something in a large bowl, as plenty of EAGER PARTY-GOERS look on. He pours a red liquid into a tray of CUPS. An attractive PARTY CHICK follows his every move. \nNICK These will be ready in 15 minutes. \nPARTY CHICK (putting it together) So it's like jello. With vodka. \nNICK Mmm hmm. You get drunk while you enjoy a delicious gelatin snack. \nPARTY CHICK How come no one ever thought of this before? \nNICK Don't know. I just invented it. Party chick looks into his eyes, dreamily. \nPARTY CHICK I appreciate you. \nNICK (way too heartfelt) I love you. \nIN THE LIVING ROOM Lou PLAYS AN ELECTRIC KEYBOARD for about 15-20 people. He's performing Ace of Base's \"The Sign\" and SINGING PASSIONATELY. Adam walks up to where Jacob aims a large VIDEO CAMERA. \nJACOB He did a bunch of drugs and went on a rant about how much he resents Ace of Base. \nADAM That band's from the 90s. \nJACOB I know. He made me borrow Tad's video camera. He wants to document the performance and sue the band for infringement when we get back. Adam sees Tad and Chaz behaving like cocks across the room, making hot girls drink too much. \nADAM (re: Tad and Chaz) So, you like these guys? \nJACOB They're rich, popular, and they shower me with compliments. They're pretty much the best friends I've ever had. \nON A BALCONY A CROWD gathers around Phil, who has removed the cover of a \nSPINNING INDUSTRIAL FAN. \nCROWD Phil! Phil! Phil! Like a zen master, Phil reaches out and GRABS A FAN BLADE, stopping the fan WITHOUT INJURY. Everyone celebrates! \nIN THE KITCHEN Nick holds up a HOMEMADE BEER BONG, from which he drinks. He has his own CROWD rooting him on. \nNICK'S CROWD Nick! Nick! Nick! He finishes the last of the beer, and the crowd celebrates. \n", "test2_true": "NICK I should. \nIN THE LIVING ROOM Lou SITS ON A COUCH with Michelle, one of the girls we met earlier at the lodge. Her friend Sandy sits across from them next to Jacob, who looks uncomfortable. \nSANDY Truth or dare? Lou confers with Michelle before answering. \nLOU Dare. \nSandy and Jacob confer, figuring out the dare. Lou meets Jacob's eyes -- he smiles, knowing Jacob has his back. \nSANDY OK, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler up his ass. Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob. \nLOU You son of a bitch! Have you ever played this game before? It's supposed to be awesome! Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and shoves it down the back of his pants. His face contorts uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears. \nLOU (CONT'D) This is a horrible thing you're doing and I hope you never have to experience what I am currently going through. Lou sits down and Michelle consoles him. \nMICHELLE Your turn! Truth or dare? Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob: \nJACOB \n(SMILES) Truth. Lou throws up his hands in frustration. He looks miserable, as Michelle confers with him. \nLOU (grumbling to Michelle) I don't care. Whatever. This is not the point of the game. \nMICHELLE OK, each of you has to tell your darkest, most personal secret. Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head. \nJACOB Oh wow, all right. Let me think. I've never told anyone this, but I was afraid of scary movies until I was 18. I even ran out of the theater a couple of times. \nSANDY Oh you poor thing! Come here... She takes Jacob's head to her chest and strokes it gently. Lou makes a jerk-off gesture. \nSANDY (CONT'D) \n(SHY) I'm not sure I should tell mine. \nMICHELLE Come on! You have to! \nSANDY OK, but you can't laugh. \nLOU \n(WHO CARES) We promise. Let's hear it. \nSANDY So this one time me and my friend Lori took a train to Baltimore. It was the summer and we wanted to party, but we had no money. So Lori found this businessman who was also looking for a good time and told him that we'd give him a half and half for seventy-five dollars. You know -- a suck and fuck. Lou and Jacob look shocked with the MATTER OF FACT storytelling. Michelle smiles. She's heard it before. \nSANDY (CONT'D) Anyway, we get him up to his room and Lori starts going down on him, but I really wasn't into it. So I broke a piece of the bathroom mirror and used it to cut his artery on the-heck. Right here... She rubs Jacob's neck, pointing it out. \nSANDY (CONT'D) He bled for about an hour before he died. \n(MORE) \nSANDY (CONT'D) Afterwards, we took his wallet to the bar and found out he only had forty-seven dollars. Michelle GIGGLES. \nSANDY (CONT'D) Michelle! You said you wouldn't laugh! \nMICHELLE \n(GIGGLING) I'm sorry! Jacob and Lou look shell-shocked. \nIN ANOTHER ROOM Adam sits in a chair in the corner, secluded. To his LEFT -- Nick's in the kitchen, catching POPCORN in his mouth and earning accolades from all his new fans. To Adam's RIGHT -- The truth or dare game devolves, as Michelle PIERCES LOU'S EAR. He screams in pain, but at the end, he has a GOLD STUD in his RIGHT EAR. Lou points at Jacob. \nLOU Fuck you, your turn. \nJACOB That's the gay ear, you know. As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD -- He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts' CASSETTE TAPE COLLECTION. Adam takes a moment to check himself. Then he reaches for his DRINK and GULPS THE WHOLE THING, before getting up and WALKING OVER to her, catching her off guard. \nADAM So I lied to you earlier. I wasn't here for a power tool convention. Jennie instinctively looks around for her friends. \n", "test2_id": 2578, "test3_input": "In the darkness, we hear SOUNDS OF SEX. Moans of pleasure, creaks of mattresses, multiple \"yesses.\" On TWIN BEDS that are a little too close to each other, Lou and Jacob have sex with Michelle and Sandy. The girls and Lou are vocal. Jacob is silent. As Sandy rides him, Jacob notices some BROKEN GLASS on the bedside table. He can't take his eyes off it, as Sandy's hand keeps brushing up against the table. Lou, naked, DRINKS A CAN OF TAB while he delivers the goods to Michelle. He reaches over, mid-act, and hands the half- empty can to Jacob. \nLOU Tab? \nJACOB Stop talking to me! Despite the fact that this looks like very good sex -- it is very bad sex for Jacob. \nFADE TO: \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE NIGHT \nAdam is asleep in bed, as Jennie quietly enters the room. He wakes up to find her wearing SEXY LINGERIE, as she CLIMBS ON TOP of him. \nADAM Jennie! \nHe looks over and sees Nick SNORING in the other bed. \nADAM (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERS) What are you doing here?! Jennie gives Adam a LONG WET KISS. He's freaked out. \nJENNIE I thought about what you said and you're right. I should be with you. \nADAM I didn't necessarily say that. \nJENNIE I want you, Adam! She RIPS OPEN her lingerie, revealing her AWESOME HEAVING \nNAKED BREASTS. \nADAM Oh my god! She kisses him again and they start to go at it. Just then -- \nLILY (O.S.) What the hell is going on here? Adam pushes Jennie off him, as the LIGHTS GO ON in the room. Lily is standing in the doorway, looking sad and angry. \nADAM Lily? \nLILY So you do like her better than me? \nADAM No, she just-- Adam looks to where Jennie just was, but now the bed is covered with PHOTOS OF JENNIE. There's also a LARGE BOX OF TISSUES and some HAND LOTION. \nADAM (CONT'D) What's all this? \n(LOOKS AROUND) Jennie? \nLILY What's wrong with my vagina, Adam? \nADAM Nothing's wrong with it. It's beautiful. In the next bed, Nick rolls over and wakes up. \nNICK It's a beautiful vagina. Among the prettiest I've ever seen. \nADAM Stay out of it, Nick! \nLILY Would it be so bad to spend the rest of your life with my vagina? \nADAM No. It wouldn't at all. Lily turns and walks out the door. \nADAM (CONT'D) Lily, it wouldn't! I love your vagina! I love your vaginaaaaaa! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - MORNING \nAdam abruptly WAKES UP. \nADAM \n(GROGGY MUMBLING) Vagina... huh? He sees Nick sitting on a bed on the other side of the room. He's ON THE PHONE, talking quietly with someone. \n", "test3_true": "NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) You think you're better than me? Last night I made jello shots and everybody loved me. \n(MORE) \nNICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) They didn't care that I only brought home 60k last year. They loved me for me. They didn't go throwing their rich parents' weight around. (wipes away a tear) I don't know, Courtney. \nINTERCUT: \nINT. CHILD'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nA 6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (Nick's future wife) listens to this crying man on the other end of the phone. \n6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE) It's OK. Nick CRIES a little bit harder. \nNICK (ON PHONE) It's so good to hear your voice. I love you, princess. I really do. You just make it so hard on me sometimes. \n6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE) It's OK. \nNICK (ON PHONE) You're right. It's OK. I just want it to be OK. Adam starts registering some of this conversation. \nADAM Who are you talking to? Nick looks at Adam and covers the receiver. \nNICK Courtney. \nADAM What do you mean \"Courtney?\" Adam picks up ANOTHER PHONE. \nADAM (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Hello? \n6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE) Hello! \nAdam, freaked out, HANGS UP his phone. \nADAM Get off the phone!! But Nick is down the rabbit hole. \nNICK (ON PHONE) Baby, I gotta go. Just think about what I said. We're so great together. It's like when we're having sex - the way our bodies become one, as we both embrace the passion of the moment-- On the other end, COURTNEY'S DAD has picked up the phone. \nCOURTNEY'S DAD (ON PHONE) \nWHO THE FUCK IS THIS?! Nick hangs up the phone and stares at it, freaked out. Adam just shakes his head. \nNICK OK, so that may have been bad. \nADAM What were you thinking? The DOOR OPENS and Lou strolls in, looking quite fresh. \nLOU Guess who re-popped his 80s cherry? This guy! He points at himself in a celebratory manner, as behind him -- The Towel Guy whose room this is comes RUNNING UP. \nTOWEL GUY Hey, get the hell out of my room! In one move, Lou catches him inside the room, closes the door with his foot, and puts the guy in a HEAD LOCK. He then converts it into a SLEEPER HOLD, putting the guy to sleep. \nNICK Oh, we're going to jail. \nLOU Help me put him in the closet. \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER \nThe guys drop the sleeping Towel Guy in the closet. \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER \nAdam, Nick, and Lou take a soak in the tub. \nADAM Has anyone seen Jacob? \nLOU He's grabbing drinks with Tad and Chaz. Which is what we should do. We'll start at the Brew Haus and do a three drink crawl up the street-- Adam gets more fed up than ever. \nADAM Guys! I refuse to accept that we're stuck in 1987! Maybe you're loving it, Lou. But you don't get it. Nick's insane, Jacob's become a bigger douche than before, and I need to get back for my goddamn rehearsal dinner? Which is tomorrow! \n", "test3_id": 2579}

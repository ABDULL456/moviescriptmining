{"train": "HOT TUB TIME MACHINE \nWritten by \nJosh Heald \nHot Tub Time Machine Theme Lyrics by Josh Heald Music by Def Leppard, Styx, Journey, Poison, or Whitesnake \nWater cranked to a hundred and three Got my tunes, my snacks, my booze, my skis (Got the) freshest moves you ever seen When I'm soakin in my Hot Tub Time Machine When you're going back to the 80s...

(Sweet guitar solo - 16 measures] Relaxed as hell when you're goin through time That's the 54 jets workin' on your spine (Yeah) you gotta be loose and you gotta be lean When you roll up in your Hot Tub Time Machine Yeah your shirt's a little psychedelic...

Hot Tub - Time Machine! Hot Tub - Time Machine! Yeah! \nFADE IN: \nEXT. POOL DECK - DAY \nBLUE SKIES. A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY. CAMERA PANS DOWN to reveal A HOT TUB FULL OF HOT CHICKS IN BIKINIS. They splash about playfully. Then-- \nA FUCKING LION JUMPS IN THE HOT TUB! As the girls SCREAM and scramble for safety, the BEAST ROARS and it becomes the: \nMGM LOGO \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nADAM COLEMAN (late 30s, good-looking, sweet-natured face) is in a great mood as he packs a SUITCASE. \nLILY (O.S.) Ready for the wildest bachelor party of all time? LILY (early 30s, shirt and jeans, hot in a smart and classy sense) walks in the room, smiling. \nADAM You know it. I'm gonna bang all sorts of chicks this weekend! \nLILY That's not the answer I was looking for. \nADAM Sorry, honey. Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss. She shows him some PHOTOS. \nLILY Look what I found... \nANGLE: PHOTO A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS and 20-SOMETHINGS PARTY IN A LARGE HOT TUB at a SKI RESORT. It looks like the most fun ever. \nADAM Check out that young stud. Can you believe he's about to get married? Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a YOUNG ADAM (17) partying at a SKI RESORT with his FRIENDS: -- In full 80s SKI GEAR on a mountain... -- Eating PIZZA at \"Papa Enzo's,\" stuffing their faces... -- Drinking BEERS at the \"Brew Haus,\" an awesome pub... -- In the HOT TUB with SIX GIRLS... Adam snatches the last photo from her. \nADAM (CONT'D) Ignore that one. Nothing happened. \n(BEAT) I love you. Lily laughs. \nLILY Adam, you didn't know me yet. As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of the photos. She stops at one and her EXPRESSION CHANGES. \nLILY (CONT'D) Who's this? Lily shows Adam a PHOTO: -- A SMOKING HOT SKI BUNNY (23, blonde, svelte, leg warmers). \nADAM I'm not sure. \nLILY Really? Lily shows Adam another PHOTO: -- YOUNG ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks like she was ambushed for the photo. \nADAM Oh! Jennie. \nLILY Who's Jennie? \nADAM She's nobody. Ski instructor. (off her look) You didn't know me yet. Lily still looks at him a little hard. \nADAM (CONT'D) Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and a face. Of course I'm gonna take her picture. Lily still looks a little bothered. \nLILY Do you still think of her? \nADAM Of course not! I think of you. As Adam goes to EMBRACE her: \nLILY Hold on... Lily goes into the CLOSET. \nAdam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest, well-kept suburban home, as a recovered, dressed, embarrassed and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag. They both stop 10 yards short of a RANGE ROVER, where the black man, NICK, waits in the car, waving. \nLILY I can't wait for you to come back and marry me. Wow, that's crazy. Adam looks almost like it just hit him. \nADAM Yeah. \n(REALIZATION) Wow. \nLILY Tell me again I have nothing to worry about. \nADAM Babe, look at Nick... In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio. \nADAM (CONT'D) You think with him in charge, we're gonna get into any kind of trouble? We'll probably eat too much pizza and I'll twist my ankle getting off the ski lift. \nLILY OK. Have an awesome bachelor party. Not too awesome. (hands him bag) I got you something. Adam looks in the bag. \nADAM Sandwich. Thanks. He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her. \nLILY Let me see your phone. He takes it out. \nADAM I told you, I'll call you when-- She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as she pockets the phone. \nLILY Despite my anxiety, I'm not gonna be one of those women who wants an update every ten minutes. Even though I do want an update every ten minutes. Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious. \nLILY (CONT'D) Just make sure whatever happens, you're back for the rehearsal dinner. \n(SHOWING CONCERN) I totally trust you. \nADAM You should. I'm a lame-o. \nLILY Well at least you're a cute lame-o. Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a disgusting display of affection. A FLASH goes off. From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone. \nNICK I'm more than willing to forget about earlier, but this shit's going on Facebook. \nINT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING \nNick drives through SUBURBIA, while Adam rides shotgun. \nNICK I have no idea what Facebook is. My phone has a button that says Send To Facebook. I've been sending shit there for months. Adam looks out the window, smiling. \nADAM I'm so psyched about this weekend! \nNICK Ditto, buddy. I'm gonna help you make up for all the good times you missed when you were being a responsible member of society. \nADAM You're a good friend. I'm sorry for putting my career and self sufficiency above bowling night. \nNICK This trip represents everything awesome about being a dude. \n(MORE) \nNICK (CONT'D) We're gonna drink too much, eat whatever we want... \n(FANTASIZING) I might not even change my socks. \nADAM Live the dream. \nNICK Best of all, we don't have to answer to anyone. Nick's PHONE rings and he answers it with his built-in BLUETOOTH. His phone voice is a little more \"sensitive.\" \nNICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Hi honey. \nCOURTNEY (V.0.) Three goddamn bags of pretzels? \nNICK (ON PHONE) (trying to save face) I'm with Adam, honey. \nCOURTNEY (V.0.) Hi Adam. (a little calmer) Nick, what have I told you about buying snacks that aren't on sale? \nADAM She's got a hell of an attorney. \nLOU Yes and thank you so very much for giving her the referral. \nADAM She told me it was for a friend. \nNICK So... what? Your wife likes black dick now? \nLOU I'm gonna slaughter you in your sleep tonight. \nADAM (turns to Lou, genuine) Thanks for coming, man. \nEXT. UPSCALE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nNick's car pulls up across from a nice apartment building, as a well-dressed, well-groomed, overly polished-looking YOUNG GUY in his 20s (JACOB) comes out, carrying a MESSENGER BAG. \nINT. NICK'S CAR -- SAME TIME \nThe guys watch Jacob carefully cross the street. \nLOU Oh, Adam's stupid brother's coming? Boo! Drive away before he gets in the car! \nADAM Be nice. I know Jacob's kind of a douche, but I'm trying to be closer to him since Mom died. Jacob gets in the back next to Lou. \nLOU \n(VERY INSINCERE) Hey buddy! How's it going? Good to see you! \nJACOB You look dirty and you smell bad. \nLOU You look gay and you smell like a basket of fancy soaps. Advantage me. \nJACOB How is that to your advantage? \nADAM He's not gay. He's just... what are you again? \nJACOB Metrosexual. \nLOU You have sex with trains? \nJACOB For your information, I fuck chicks. Hot ones. \nLOU For your information, you fuck dudes. Gay ones. \nJACOB Yeah, well at least I'm young and my life's full of potential. I hear you're homeless now? \nLOU (to Nick and Adam) You told him?! \n(GRIMACES) I hate all you people. \nADAM Will you two please shake hands and make up? We're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Jacob distractedly TEXTS on his phone. \nJACOB Yeah, about that. Why aren't we going to Aspen? Vermont's lame. \nADAM It's gonna be fun. \nJACOB Yeah, whatever. And with that, the guys travel in silence for a few moments, the lifeblood drained from the car. Finally... \nLOU I've gotta take a shit. \nINT. BURGER KING REST STOP - DAY \nLou walks from the bathroom back to the TABLE where Adam, Nick, and Jacob sit and eat. \nLOU That was an ugly experience. \nLOU Adam, trust me. Biggest mistake of my life - not fucking a whore at my bachelor party. \nNICK That's the biggest mistake of your life? \nLOU Fuck yeah. And he's not making that same mistake. \nADAM Uh... I'm not having sex with anyone this weekend. Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out. \nLOU Ohhhh. I gotcha. \n(WINKING) You're not having sex this weekend. \nADAM I'm not having sex this weekend. Without the winking. \nLOU \n(WINKING) Right. No winking. \n(WINKS AGAIN) I understand. \nADAM I'm pretty sure you don't. \nINT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING \nNick's car transitions from the HIGHWAY to the MOUNTAINS to the WOODS, as we track the drive. Finally, the car passes a \"Welcome to Havenhurst\" sign. \nNICK Gentlemen... welcome to Havenhurst. \nADAM Yes! \nEXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - AFTERNOON \nThe car winds through the main thoroughfare. Rather than a quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare, with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS. It's the exact opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos. \nINT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - AFTERNOON - DRIVING \nThe guys look out the windows, wearing bummed expressions. \nJACOB so this is the coolest town ever? \nADAM Oh man. The Brew Haus is a PF Chang's. Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a \"Hannah Montana 3-D Experience!\" He looks utterly disgusted. \nLOU I don't even have the heart to tell you what I just fucking saw. But say goodbye to Papa Enzo's. This town sucks. \nNICK What the fuck is going on? The car climbs a twisty part of the road. \nNICK (CONT'D) Please god let it still be there... \nJACOB What? \nADAM Pink Paradise. Best strip club ever. The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The beginning reads \"Pink.\" \nNICK Yes! It lives! The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into view: \"Pinkberry.\" \nLOU I wanna die. \nJACOB \n(OBLIVIOUS) Sweet, there's a Pinkberry here. \nEXT. PINE VALLEY INN - AFTERNOON \nThe car pulls into the parking lot of this RUNDOWN lodge. \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - AFTERNOON \nEXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON \nOn a patio outside their suite, our guys stare at a KICK-ASS TOP OF THE LINE HOT TUB. Spacious seating, plenty of jets, underwater lighting. It's amazing. Adam, Nick, and Lou look energized. \nLOU Thank. God. \nADAM At least some things never change. \nJACOB What's the big deal about a hot tub? \nADAM Shame on you. \nNICK There's plenty of time for tubbin'. Let's ski. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN - AFTERNOON \nAt the top of the mountain, Adam, Nick, and Lou look ridiculous in TIGHT, RETRO-STYLE NEON SKI JUMPSUITS. Jacob, on a snowboard, is the only one dressed in current attire. \nJACOB (re: their outfits) When's the last time you guys actually went skiing? \nADAM It's been a few years. \nNICK I think we look good. \nJACOB Then you're an idiot. \nNICK All right, we race down the mountain. Loser buys first round. Premium shit only. \nJACOB You gonna be all right? \nNICK What does that mean? \nJACOB I dunno - do black dudes ski? \nNICK Of course black dudes ski. Aren't I wearing skis? \nJACOB I'm just not sure you're representative. \nNICK You're calling me an Uncle Tom? \nJACOB I don't even know what that means. \nNICK It means black dudes ski. (pulls down goggles) Catch ya at the bottom. Nick takes off and... gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a GRASSY PATCH and falls over. \nLOU Black dudes don't ski. \nADAM \n(MOCK YELLING) How's the bottom? \nCUT TO: \nADAM HITS A BAD PATCH AND FALLS DOWN. \nCUT TO: \nJACOB AND LOU COLLIDE, BOTH TRYING TO AVOID A BARE PATCH. \nCUT TO: \nNICK PICKS UP SPEED, BEFORE HITTING A BARE PATCH AND FALLING. \nA LITTLE OLD LADY SLOWLY SKIS PAST HIM, KICKING UP POWDER. \nEXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - NIGHT \nLOU Quiet, men are talking. Aiden approaches. \nAIDEN Get you guys some to-go boxes? \nLOU I would like you to die. And then I would like you to leave. Aiden walks away, freaked out. Lou turns back to the guys. \nLOU (CONT'D) It's tub time. \nEXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - NIGHT \nLou, Adam, and Nick all have HUGE SMILES, as they gaze at the tub. They each hold a TON OF BOOZE. Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all. Lou strips down to his underwear and CLIMBS IN. \nLOU Oh my god. The water is perfect. \nHe POURS A VODKA and SLAMS IT BACK. Adam climbs in with Lou, pouring his own drink. \nJACOB I really don't see the appeal. It's like a glorified bath. \nNICK Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the whole thing! You ski all day. Then you hit the town, get trashed, and lure some fine ladies back to the lodge for some good old fashioned tubbin'. Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back. \nNICK (CONT'D) So the town's dead? Fine, we skip that part and go right to the tub. Trust me. If there's fun to be had, the tub is a good start. Nick gets in. \nNICK (CONT'D) Yes! It's amazing. Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three guys are already starting to look more energized and happy, splashing around. After another beat of consideration... \nJACOB Fuck it. Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually starts to loosen up a bit and smiles. \nLOU Well? \nJACOB I'm not convinced this is anything more than a bath, but it's nice. \nNICK Hit him with some bubbles. \nADAM Coming right up. Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a TUBBIN' MONTAGE over Reel 2 Real's \"I Like to Move It.\" \n-- In the tub, the guys DRINK like fish, pouring various combinations of VODKA, RED BULL, MOUNTAIN DEW, BACARDI, and anything else they can get their hands on. -- Jacob's LAPTOP is propped on the edge of the tub, playing BETTER OFF DEAD. Every so often, one of our guys takes a drink, playing a game, the rules of which only they know. -- Adam takes a big bite of the SANDWICH Lily gave him. -- Nick uses his iPhone to take video and pictures. More drinking games. The guys wear funny HATS and roll dice on a PIECE OF WOOD. Adam has to drink some tub water. -- The guys keep reaching into ADAM'S BACKPACK for MIXERS. -- Nick, Adam, and Lou LAUGH. Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's head, which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER. Jacob coughs and spits out water and looks pissed. Then he smiles and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way. -- Slam! Another bottle of vodka killed. Crush! Another empty Red Bull his the patio. -- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC TABLE. Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it. -- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED HIM across the chest. Still, he dances in the tub. -- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3 BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY, before changing back. -- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub. Adam very dangerously jumps in, attached to a SNOWBOARD. -- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER, as hands reach into the backpack. More vodka. More Dew. More Red Bull. More Bacardi... The cuts SPEED UP and INTENSIFY until finally in a BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT, we \nEXPLODE TO: \nTHE SUN RISING JUST ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS. \nEXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - DAWN \nAs the light of a new day spills into Havenhurst, we find all four of our guys PASSED OUT in the hot tub, the water calm. A KITTEN licks Lou's face. It's adorable. Until... \nLou JOLTS AWAKE and PUKES ON THE KITTEN, sending it FLYING! This wakes up everyone and they stir to life, inspecting the carnage, mostly hangover-related. \nNICK Oh my god, I wanna die. \nJACOB I need a vitamin water. Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices. \nADAM Red Bull or Fresca? Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS. \nLOU That fucking bear got me good. \nADAM Yeah he did. \nLOU But we showed him, didn't we? \nADAM If by showing him, you mean we laughed and he got bored and wandered off into the woods with your sneakers, then yeah, we got him good. \nLOU Fuck yeah. Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a BITE. \nADAM You just puked. \nLOU That's why I'm eating your sandwich. I'm fucking starving. \nADAM Spazzes? \nDUDE IN SUNGLASSES \n(VERY ANGRY) Yeah, dipstick. You narcs? You Miami Vice? Which one's Crockett? Which one's CROCKETT?! \nADAM I'm Crockett, obviously! \n(TO NICK) That's the Don Johnson one, right? The dude flips out a SWITCHBLADE. \nDUDE IN SUNGLASSES You show me you're not spazzes. \nNICK We're not spazzes. The dude extends the coke once more. \nDUDE IN SUNGLASSES Show me. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - MOMENTS LATER \nAt the top of the mountain, Nick looks WIDE AWAKE. Adam, on the other hand, looks COKED OUT OF HIS SKULL. He sniffs, fidgets, clenches his jaw, and looks generally \"up.\" \nNICK Adam, you gotta chill. You just did one line. \nADAM I've never ridden the horse before. \nNICK You're not riding the horse. The horse is heroin. Adam can't stop moving and fidgeting. \nADAM I don't know what kind of animal I'm riding, but it's the best animal of all time. I feel great! Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain and he goes FLYING DOWN THE SLOPE. \nNICK Adam! Jesus. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN / SKI TRAIL - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nAdam TUCKS down, still CLENCHING HIS TEETH. He PICKS UP SPEED as he flies down the mountain like a racer. \nFURTHER UP THE MOUNTAIN Nick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety. \nON ADAM He zips along, never changing course or slowing. He BARELY MISSES a few TREES. But he can't stop himself before -- \nHE BARRELS INTO A SMOKING HOT CHICK! The collision knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and finally stops Adam's hyper-speed descent. Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs. \nADAM What a rush! He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up. \nADAM (CONT'D) Oh wow, are you OK? \nSMOKING HOT CHICK No thanks to you, asshole! \nIN SLOW MOTION -- The girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner, SHAKING THE SNOW from her luxurious blonde hair. It twinkles in the sunlight. As she turns to face Adam, NORMAL SPEED RESUMES. And he sees who it is: \nADAM \n(MIND BLOWN) Jennie O'Keefe! Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place him. \nJENNIE Do I know you? He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still looks loopy from the coke. Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered hair, striped-jumpsuited guy (BLAINE) SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM. \nBLAINE I'm gonna serve you a knuckle sandwich, airhead. \n(TO JENNIE) You all right, babe? \nJENNIE I think so. \nBlaine's TOADIES (TAD and CHAZ) ski up behind him, as Blaine ANGRILY RIPS Adam's lift ticket from his jacket. \nBLAINE Your lift ticket's been revoked. Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends. \nADAM (a la Lethal Weapon 2) Diplomatic immunity. Blaine looks confused, as Adam RIPS Blaine's lift ticket, but he ends up RIPPING BLAINE'S JACKET too. \nLOU (with genuine emotion) We're in 1971. \nADAM \n(CORRECTING HIM) We're in 1987. Everyone looks stunned and dazed. \nJACOB What are we gonna do? I have plans next weekend. \nADAM We all have plans. It's my fucking wedding! \nNICK Now hold on, we don't know for sure that we're in 1987. The TV shows a (real) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64 computer, with a JINGLE that SINGS: \"Are you keeping up with the Commodore, 'cause the Commodore's keeping up with you...\" \nWhen it's over... \nNICK (CONT'D) OK, we're in 1987. Adam stands up, completely losing it. \nADAM What the FUCK is going on?! Nick stands up and calmly takes charge. \nNICK Everyone relax. I think I know what's happened. And when we're done discussing it, we're all gonna feel a lot better. Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer. \nNICK (CONT'D) Two words: black hole. He lets it hang in the air for a moment, as if it's suddenly going to gel for everyone. But the guys look confused. \nNICK (CONT'D) I saw a special on the Science Channel. And guess what? Sometimes this happens. \nADAM This happens? \nNICK Yes. And the best thing for us to do is to stay put. The universe will eventually reverse itself and work out this little glitch. Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness. \nADAM This is a big glitch. \nJACOB Yeah, you're an idiot. Black holes are in space. Not at a ski resort. \nLOU \n(HOPEFUL) So does this mean we get to go to girls' locker rooms and see them naked and they can't see us? \nJACOB No, we traveled through time. We're not invisible. Lou looks upset. \nLOU (under his breath) I'm still gonna do it. \nADAM Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness of how we got here for a moment-- \nNICK Black hole. \nADAM How are we supposed to get back? For a moment, everyone sits and absorbs the question. Then: \nLOU We find a scientist. \nCUT TO: \nINT. IBM / RECEPTION - LATE AFTERNOON \nOur guys WAIT NERVOUSLY near a RECEPTION DESK, above which is the \"IBM\" logo. Lou reads a MAGAZINE. \nLOU This Dukakis guy seems like he might be the real deal. An affable MAN IN A SUIT approaches. \nMAN IN SUIT Gentlemen, how may I help you? \nNICK We're waiting for a scientist. \nMAN IN SUIT I am a scientist. \nLOU Where's your white coat? \nSCIENTIST I'm not that kind of scientist. \nAdam and Nick watch the car pull out of the parking lot. \nADAM \n(SOBERING SLIGHTLY) This will not end well. \nINT./EXT. DELOREAN - SAME TIME \nJacob and Lou hit the road, picking up speed. They pass a COP, who pulls out, turning on his LIGHTS AND SIREN. \nLOU Oh shit, they found me! I don't know how but they found me! \n(LAUGHS) I always wanted to say that. Punch it! Jacob HITS THE GAS. \nLOU (CONT'D) Let's see the look on this pig's face when we hit 88 and disappear into thin air! Yeah! The SPEEDOMETER hits 75, 80, 85, and then 90. And then 95. The car SHAKES VIOLENTLY. \nLOU (CONT'D) \n(SURPRISED) This thing's a piece of shit. Up ahead, the ROAD CURVES DRASTICALLY. \nJACOB Hey Lou? \nLOU Yeah? \nJACOB \n(VERY CALM) We're doing a hundred. I can't control this car. \nLOU \n(NODS) I hear ya. \nEXT. ROAD - EARLY EVENING \nThe Delorean BRAKES, but doesn't make the turn. It FLIPS OVER in a fantastic disaster and comes to a stop in a DITCH. The COP pulls over, gets out of his car, and DRAWS HIS GUN. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING \nAdam and Nick watch the accident from a distance. \nADAM So do you think we should run away? \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nLooking ragged as hell, the four guys walk into the room and silently collapse on various BEDS and COUCHES. \nLOU I wonder if we'll still be here for our court appearance. \nADAM If we're still here in four months, I will happily go to jail, because I'll be fucked anyway. A GUY walks out of the bathroom, wearing only a TOWEL. He looks startled. \nTOWEL GUY Who the hell are you dweebs?! Lou is up IN A FLASH. He IMMEDIATELY DECKS THE GUY OUT COLD and PUMMELS HIM on the floor! The others pull him off. \nNICK Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou?! \nLOU I have no tolerance for intruders. \nNICK This is probably his room! We're not registered here in 87. Lou thinks for a moment and looks a \"little\" sorry. \nLOU I'm still pretty OK with it. \nADAM You have a problem. \nLOU Just help me put him outside. \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nLOU If he doesn't lose that arm soon, I'm gonna take it from him myself. With that, Lou wanders off toward another room, leering at and groping girls as he goes. \nADAM \n(RE: LOU) He's gonna be a problem. Tad and Chaz walk over, looking dapper and douchey. They are excited to see Jacob. \nTAD Hey, glad you could make it! \nADAM \n(ANNOYED) This is your party? \nCHAZ Hey man, no hard feelings, all right? If your bro says you're cool, then we're cool. Tad puts his arm around Jacob and leads him into the party. \nTAD There's some people I want you to meet. By the way, bodacious hair. Incredibly chic. \nJACOB \n(FLATTERED) Oh yeah? It doesn't really take that much product. It's all in the layering. \nTAD Whoa. Product. You're blowing my mind right now. Did you spend time in Europe? \nCHAZ Don't tell me. Prague. Do you want some coke? \nJACOB Do you have Coke Zero? \nTAD Ah, a conscientious objector. I like that. Gotta stay sharp. \nIN THE KITCHEN Nick mixes something in a large bowl, as plenty of EAGER PARTY-GOERS look on. He pours a red liquid into a tray of CUPS. An attractive PARTY CHICK follows his every move. \nNICK These will be ready in 15 minutes. \nPARTY CHICK (putting it together) So it's like jello. With vodka. \nNICK Mmm hmm. You get drunk while you enjoy a delicious gelatin snack. \nPARTY CHICK How come no one ever thought of this before? \nNICK Don't know. I just invented it. Party chick looks into his eyes, dreamily. \nPARTY CHICK I appreciate you. \nNICK (way too heartfelt) I love you. \nIN THE LIVING ROOM Lou PLAYS AN ELECTRIC KEYBOARD for about 15-20 people. He's performing Ace of Base's \"The Sign\" and SINGING PASSIONATELY. Adam walks up to where Jacob aims a large VIDEO CAMERA. \nJACOB He did a bunch of drugs and went on a rant about how much he resents Ace of Base. \nADAM That band's from the 90s. \nJACOB I know. He made me borrow Tad's video camera. He wants to document the performance and sue the band for infringement when we get back. Adam sees Tad and Chaz behaving like cocks across the room, making hot girls drink too much. \nADAM (re: Tad and Chaz) So, you like these guys? \nJACOB They're rich, popular, and they shower me with compliments. They're pretty much the best friends I've ever had. \nON A BALCONY A CROWD gathers around Phil, who has removed the cover of a \nSPINNING INDUSTRIAL FAN. \nCROWD Phil! Phil! Phil! Like a zen master, Phil reaches out and GRABS A FAN BLADE, stopping the fan WITHOUT INJURY. Everyone celebrates! \nIN THE KITCHEN Nick holds up a HOMEMADE BEER BONG, from which he drinks. He has his own CROWD rooting him on. \nNICK'S CROWD Nick! Nick! Nick! He finishes the last of the beer, and the crowd celebrates. \nJENNIE I know. You don't look like you could handle power tools. \nADAM The truth is, Jennie, I've always liked you. But I've never really known you. I really wasn't supposed to meet you again. \nJENNIE Who are you?! Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her. \nADAM I came here from the future. She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners. \nJENNIE Let me guess. You want to beam me up to your spaceship built for two? Or maybe you're wondering if these are astronaut pants? \nADAM Astronaut pants? \nJENNIE Because my ass is out of this world? Give me a break, spaz. I've heard them all. She turns away. Adam goes after her. \nADAM No! No spaceship. No astronaut pants. Just regular time travel. With normal pants. \nJENNIE OK, what's the punch line? An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine. \nBLAINE I thought I told you to stay off my mountain, partner! \nJENNIE Blaine, stop! \nBLAINE You talking to my girl? Huh? I can't hear you. Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder. \nJENNIE Blaine, that's enough! Let him go! He can't breathe! Blaine doesn't stop. He smiles like an asshole. \nBLAINE Can't breathe? Is that right? Can you breathe, partner? What's that? I can't hear you. Just tell me you can't breathe and I'll stop. Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs. \nBLAINE (CONT'D) He's not saying anything. I guess he can breathe. Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam. \nBLAINE (CONT'D) Babe, stop. Jennie, stop! Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She goes down. He releases Adam and turns to help her. \nBLAINE (CONT'D) Baby, I'm sorry. (turns to Adam) See what you made me do?! \nJENNIE Screw you, Blaine! Jennie gets up. She grabs Adam's arm and YANKS HIM along with her, as she storms away. \nJENNIE (CONT'D) \n(TO ADAM) Come on, let's go! Blaine looks ON FIRE, as he watches Jennie leave with Adam. \nLOU (V.0.) Sandy, I don't know what you did with this wine, but it is delightful. \nINT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nJacob and Lou sit with Michelle and Sandy back at the girls' apartment. The whole place looks like a Madonna concert. \nJacob looks uncomfortable, but Lou pours on the polite charm. \nSANDY It's from a box. There's lots! \nLOU Mmm. Fantastic. \n(QUICK TURN) Do you mind if I borrow my friend? We'll only be a moment. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nLou has Jacob PINNED AGAINST THE WALL with his arm. He speaks quietly, but with purpose. \nLOU You're gonna fuck her! \nJACOB I'm not gonna have sex with her. She killed a guy! \nLOU That guy was undesirable. You heard her. It was about the money. \nIn the darkness, we hear SOUNDS OF SEX. Moans of pleasure, creaks of mattresses, multiple \"yesses.\" On TWIN BEDS that are a little too close to each other, Lou and Jacob have sex with Michelle and Sandy. The girls and Lou are vocal. Jacob is silent. As Sandy rides him, Jacob notices some BROKEN GLASS on the bedside table. He can't take his eyes off it, as Sandy's hand keeps brushing up against the table. Lou, naked, DRINKS A CAN OF TAB while he delivers the goods to Michelle. He reaches over, mid-act, and hands the half- empty can to Jacob. \nLOU Tab? \nJACOB Stop talking to me! Despite the fact that this looks like very good sex -- it is very bad sex for Jacob. \nFADE TO: \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE NIGHT \nAdam is asleep in bed, as Jennie quietly enters the room. He wakes up to find her wearing SEXY LINGERIE, as she CLIMBS ON TOP of him. \nADAM Jennie! \nHe looks over and sees Nick SNORING in the other bed. \nADAM (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERS) What are you doing here?! Jennie gives Adam a LONG WET KISS. He's freaked out. \nJENNIE I thought about what you said and you're right. I should be with you. \nADAM I didn't necessarily say that. \nJENNIE I want you, Adam! She RIPS OPEN her lingerie, revealing her AWESOME HEAVING \nNAKED BREASTS. \nADAM Oh my god! She kisses him again and they start to go at it. Just then -- \nLILY (O.S.) What the hell is going on here? Adam pushes Jennie off him, as the LIGHTS GO ON in the room. Lily is standing in the doorway, looking sad and angry. \nADAM Lily? \nLILY So you do like her better than me? \nADAM No, she just-- Adam looks to where Jennie just was, but now the bed is covered with PHOTOS OF JENNIE. There's also a LARGE BOX OF TISSUES and some HAND LOTION. \nADAM (CONT'D) What's all this? \n(LOOKS AROUND) Jennie? \nLILY What's wrong with my vagina, Adam? \nADAM Nothing's wrong with it. It's beautiful. In the next bed, Nick rolls over and wakes up. \nNICK It's a beautiful vagina. Among the prettiest I've ever seen. \nADAM Stay out of it, Nick! \nLILY Would it be so bad to spend the rest of your life with my vagina? \nADAM No. It wouldn't at all. Lily turns and walks out the door. \nADAM (CONT'D) Lily, it wouldn't! I love your vagina! I love your vaginaaaaaa! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - MORNING \nAdam abruptly WAKES UP. \nADAM \n(GROGGY MUMBLING) Vagina... huh? He sees Nick sitting on a bed on the other side of the room. He's ON THE PHONE, talking quietly with someone. \nLOU \n(CALMLY) Adam. I know I don't look like I understand, but I do. You have a beautiful fiancee who means more to you than anything in the world. And if you could, you'd literally travel across time for her. \nADAM Yes. \nLOU I get it, man. Life is about these moments. Moments where a regular Joe becomes a hero. Moments where you dig deep and find the motivation... the courage... the guts to do what's right and what's necessary. It's moments like these... Lou suddenly notices some COCAINE on the edge of the tub. \nLOU (CONT'D) Jesus, how come nobody told me there was coke out here? Lou SNORTS A BIG LINE. \nLOU (CONT'D) What was I saying? Adam and Nick get out and towel off. Lou follows. \nADAM Maybe we have to learn something? \nNICK What do you mean? \nADAM You know, like Groundhog Day. We have to learn the meaning of life or some shit. Just then, a KITTEN licking a PUDDLE on the base of the tub JUMPS in the hot tub and VANISHES IN A BRIGHT LIGHT! For a moment, everyone is quiet. \nLOU \n(FREAKED OUT) I've gotta stop doing cocaine and I need to go to the hospital. I just saw a fucking kitten explode. \nNICK I saw it too. The guys run over to the tub. The bubbles are on low, but there's NOTHING IN IT. \nADAM It didn't explode. It vanished. It went back... to the present. \nLOU This is the present. \nADAM Our old present. \nNICK So it is the tub! Lou POINTS at something. \nLOU Um... The HOT TUB IS NOT PLUGGED IN, and yet it's clearly running. \nADAM OK. You guys know what to do. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - MINUTES LATER \nThe guys have a COUPLE BOXES OF KITTENS. One at a time, they get in the tub and take turns DIPPING THE KITTENS. When nothing happens, Lou DUMPS an entire box of kittens into the tub. The cats get ANGRY and CLAW AT HIS FACE and body. Eventually, the guys just shake their heads. \nADAM This isn't working. \nLOU Maybe these aren't the right kittens? Adam points at him in a \"now you're thinking\" way. \nADAM We'll split up. Get as many different cats as you can. Let's all meet back here in an hour. \nLOU You can count on me! \nINT. BREW HAUS - DAY \nLou sits on a stool, munching on snacks. A TV shows the AFC conference championship game between the Denver Broncos and the Cleveland Browns. It's the 4th Quarter and the Browns score with 5:43 remaining on the clock to go up by 7. Two stools over, a SLICK-HAIRED ASSHOLE (RICK) sits with his bored-looking HIGH SOCIETY TROPHY WIFE (CANDACE). \nRICK Yes! \nLOU Hate to tell ya, pal. Browns are gonna lose by 3 in overtime. \nRICK Eat shit and die, scumbag. I've got ten large on this game. \nLOU Not only that, but I bet you Elway's gonna throw a touchdown with 37 seconds left. \nRICK Fat chance, pal. Elway's done nothing all day. \nLOU Care to make it interesting? \nJENNIE Fine. You wanna see Blaine? It's your funeral. He's in the warehouse at the end of Lawrence. Good luck. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY \nAdam walks off the mountain with Nick and Lou. \nLOU Moment of truth. Lou takes off his hat and feels his scalp - no hair. \nLOU (CONT'D) \n(LOOKS BACK) That fucker! Just then, Lou's NOSE SLIGHTLY SHIFTS, the result of being broken and never fixed. It stays this wa for the rest of the movie. Lou touches his nose. \nLOU (CONT'D) Oh, that's just great. Jacob runs up, in a friendlier disposition. \nJACOB Hey guys! \nADAM I thought you were with douche patrol. \nJACOB Yeah I was. But it turned out those guys are date rapists. \nADAM Ah. \nNICK Adam, where are we going? Adam gets a look of determination again. \nADAM To get my bag. We get that, we have the Red Bull, and our ticket home. \nLOU Yes! The race is on! \nADAM What race? \nLOU Duh, it's 1987? We're at a ski resort? \n(SHAKES HEAD) Disputes like these are settled with a downhill ski race. Usually at dawn. It's the law. \nADAM You're an idiot. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON \nAdam and the guys step into a warehouse. WET FLOOR, CHAINS hanging from the ceiling for no reason, STEAM rising from grates. As they enter, Chaz pulls down a large GARAGE DOOR. Up ahead, Blaine sits on some CRATES with Tad. \nBLAINE Welcome to my lair. \nADAM You live here? \nNICK Yeah, this is kind of a shitty place to live. \nBLAINE I don't live here. Adam approaches Blaine, trying to speak maturely. \nADAM Look. Blaine. I think we got off on the wrong foot. You have some issue with me. \nBLAINE You get blown by my girl? I'll say that's one hell of an issue. \nLOU Whoa! You got blown?! \nADAM She didn't blow me. She lied to you to make you jealous. I'm not trying to steal Jennie. I just wanna get my bag. \nBLAINE Oh, your bag. I was wondering when you'd come around for that. Tad holds up the BACKPACK over by the crates. \nADAM Yeah, I'll just take it and get out of your way. \nBLAINE You will? Adam EXTENDS HIS HAND. \nADAM Whattya say? Can we work this out like gentlemen? Blaine PULLS A KNIFE. Tad and Chaz also PULL KNIVES. \nNICK What is this town's obsession with knives? \nADAM Friends? Jacob takes Adam's hand and helps him to his feet. \nJACOB Brothers. They EMBRACE. Lou looks disgusted. \nLOU Gay. Blaine and his goons approach from below. Adam puts on his game face. \nADAM I didn't think you guys would show. \nBLAINE This was my idea. \nADAM It's gonna make my victory taste all the more sweeter. Like a Peach Snapple. \nBLAINE A what? \nADAM You'll see. Blaine actually looks rattled, as the two men get lined up. Adam is on a SNOWBOARD. \nBLAINE What's that? \nADAM You're not afraid of getting beat by a guy on a skateboard, are you? \nBLAINE I've seen you in action. You're reckless and terrible. \nADAM Reckless and terrible's my middle name. Because I feel the need... (pulls on goggles) for speed! Chaz holds out his arm as a starting line. \nADAM (CONT'D) Catch ya at the bottom. \nCHAZ \n3, 2, 1... GO! Blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional skiier, which he pretty much is. Adam looks toward Jacob, who demonstrates the proper CROUCH. Adam slowly picks up speed, starting at about one mile per hour. Blaine looks back and can't believe how easily he's gonna coast to victory. \nADAM Here goes nothing. Instead of weaving back and forth, Adam just stays in the crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly PASSES BLAINE, despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course. He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING! Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE, skiing more recklessly too. He begins catching up to Adam. Blaine skis up next to Adam - they're both going full force. \nBLAINE You can't beat me! I was born on this mountain! \nADAM I was born in a hospital like a normal baby! Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY MISSING trees and rocks. Blaine tries to keep up. Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND. \nThe SNOWBOARD FLIES OFF INTO THE AIR! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN / BASE - DAY \nPhil stands against a SHED, as a GUY THROWS A HATCHET at him, just narrowly missing his arm. Phil FLEXES HIS MUSCLES, as a \nHOT CHICK KISSES HIM. Then the SNOWBOARD FLIES INTO FRAME and SLICES OFF PHIL'S ARM, sending BLOOD SPLATTER EVERYWHERE! \nPHIL Ahhhh! My arm!!! \nEXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAY - SAME TIME \nLou watches with BINOCULARS and PUMPS HIS FIST. \nLOU Yes! \nEXT. MOUNTAIN - RACE - DAY \nAs Adam tumbles on the ground, Blaine smiles, thinking he has the victory in the bag. But instead of stopping, Adam picks up speed, as he TUMBLES LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain. With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch Adam. It's gonna be close. At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line first. Blaine pulls up, pissed off to lose the race. Adam's momentum carries him forward another 50 yards, where he SMASHES INTO A DECK and finally comes to a stop. \nCUT TO: \nA CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE POPS! \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA large \"BON VOYAGE\" BANNER hangs in the room. \nLily waits by the bathroom door with some PEPTO and a GLASS OF WATER. She looks very concerned. \nADAM (V.0.) Lily had every opportunity to leave. She didn't know me at all and she certainly didn't owe me anything after the night I put her through. But she stayed. \nINT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAdam lays on the couch, his head in Lily's lap. She feeds him a little GATORADE. He keeps it down... for a moment. Then he turns and VOMITS into a BUCKET on the floor. \nADAM (V.0.) She saw me at my worst and she stayed. Lily holds the bucket, as Adam pukes into it. \nBACK TO: \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - DAY \nNick, Lou, and Jacob look sick. \nADAM Don't you see? This is more than a sandwich. It represents all that shit. All that puke. \nLOU Keep the sandwich. \nJACOB This is disgusting. \nADAM She gave me this as a reminder of her love. \n(THINKS) Or to give me horrible diarrhea so I didn't leave the room during the bachelor party. But mostly as a reminder of her love. Adam holds up the sandwich. \nADAM (CONT'D) This is the reason I need to go home. Adam stands up and walks toward the door with the sandwich. \nADAM (CONT'D) I'm gonna go prep the tub. Lou holds up a BAG OF CHIPS. \nLOU Do you have any stories about these chips or can I eat them? \nEXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - CONTINUOUS \nAdam walks outside, taking a bite of the SANDWICH. He finds Jennie waiting in the TUB. \nJENNIE There you are! \nADAM Jennie! What are you doing here? \nJENNIE Making good on a rumor. Jennie STANDS UP in the tub and she's TOPLESS. Adam DROPS THE SANDWICH, shocked. \nADAM Whoa. \nJennie continues talking, shamelessly exposing herself. \nJENNIE When I saw you win that race against Blaine, everything changed for me. I realize now that I deserve more. I deserve a winner. \n(SEDUCTIVE) Come and get your prize. Adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a ROBE. \nADAM Yeah, I... can't. She covers up, embarrassed. \nJENNIE Oh my god. I missed my opportunity. \nADAM No, I'm not sure there ever was an opportunity. Jennie, you're terrific. You've brought me so many moments of joy, you'll never know. But I shouldn't have given you the wrong idea. Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks. \nADAM (CONT'D) The truth is there's a girl I need to go see. We have plans to spend the rest of our lives together. And I can't wait any longer. (listening to himself) And I'm totally cool with it. Adam smiles, feeling the rush of knowing he's ready. But then he sees how sad Jennie is. He moves closer to her. \nADAM (CONT'D) One day, you're going to find the right guy who's willing to give up everything and travel across time and space for your love. She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her. \nJENNIE \n(EMOTIONAL) I would totally blow you right now. \nADAM I know you would. \nADAM I don't wanna hear any more! They sit in horrified silence for a bit. \nLOU You'll have to introduce me when we get there. Your families won't know me. Although I'm sure they're huge fans. \n(ABRUPT) So hey, getting married, huh? Taking the plunge! Adam looks disturbed. Nick looks confused. \nNICK This makes no sense at all. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nLily looks beautiful, surrounded by FAMILY and FRIENDS. Still, she looks distant and lonely. Until -- A LILY (the flower) comes into frame. Lily smiles and stands up. She turns around. Adam's standing there with a whole bouquet of flowers. Lily gives him a BIG HUG AND KISS. When she's done: \nLILY Don't you ever let me take your phone again! \nADAM \n(COY) I'm here on time. Just like I promised. Nick sits down next to COURTNEY and Jacob takes his seat. \nADAM (CONT'D) (no nerves at all) I'm so happy to see you and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. \nLILY \n(TEARFUL) Me too! \nADAM You're the one. Lily notices Adam's on CRUTCHES. \nLILY Oh my god, what happened? \nLOU (O.S.) My fault entirely, madam! The room is ABUZZ with CHATTER, as Lou makes a nearly REGAL ENTRANCE, wearing a WHITE TUXEDO. \nGUY AT TABLE Hey, it's Lou Blustein! The whole room APPLAUDS Lou, as he walks in. Adam and the guys can't believe it. \nLOU I was partaking in a little ski adventure and I mistakenly wandered into your fiance's path. His broken leg is my broken heart. My most humble apologies. Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses Lily's hand. She looks genuinely flattered. Lou gets up and whispers to Adam. \nLOU (CONT'D) See? I'm awesome here. You shoulda stayed out of that tub. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - LATER \nNick SLOW DANCES with Courtney. \nNICK I was thinking we'd invite Adam and Lily over for dinner when they get back from their honeymoon. That's... if it's OK with you? \nCOURTNEY Why wouldn't it be OK with me? That sounds nice. \n(SMILES) \n(MORE) \nCOURTNEY (CONT'D) You look so good in this shirt, by the way. Nice choice. She puts her head on Nick's shoulder as they dance. \nNICK So... how are your parents? \nCOURTNEY Still working hard. I really wish they could retire already, but it's tough competing with the big chains. I mean, they just have the one store... \nFLASHBACK TO: \nEXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - 1987 - DAY \nThe Japanese Businessman is on a PAY PHONE, speaking RAPIDLY in Japanese. \nJAPANESE BUSINESSMAN \n(IN JAPANESE) Hiro-san! Cancel the paperwork! We have to get back to Tokyo. I have inside information that undermines the supermarket deal. Nick stands next to him, nodding and SMILING WIDELY. \n", "test1_input": "JACOB (CONT'D) This is gonna be a problem. He takes out his wallet, showing his CREDIT CARDS and CASH. \nJACOB (CONT'D) Guys, we're in trouble. Our cards aren't gonna work and our new money looks fake. The guys look concerned, but then Nick notices something: \nA TABLE FULL OF JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN. \nNICK I've got an idea. As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks around the room and by the bar, he spots -- \nJennie. He stares at her from across the room. Lou and Jacob notice. \nADAM I still can't believe it's really her! \nLOU She's aged remarkably well. \n(REMEMBERS) Oh, right. Why don't you just go talk to her? \nADAM I should go talk to her. To apologize, of course. You know, nothing inappropriate. \nLOU Sure... Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way over across the room. Jennie is talking to TWO OTHER GIRLS as Adam approaches. He lurks near them like a creep. Jennie eventually notices him, as he keeps stealing glances. She doesn't look happy. \nJENNIE \n(TO ADAM) Listen putz, if you're gonna try to attack me again, my boyfriend will be here soon. He'll kick your ass. Adam tries to be casual. \nADAM No, no. No ass kicking. I just wanted to say I'm sorry about earlier. I lost control of the old skis there. \n(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Looks like I shoulda taken another one of your classes! \nJENNIE When did you take my class? \nADAM Certainly not when I was a kid! I mean, that would make no sense! Adam tries to recover. \nADAM (CONT'D) I was here for a convention. Power tools. And regular tools. All sorts of tools. I'm big into tools. It was a couple years ago. Jennie looks very suspect of Adam. \nJENNIE Yeah, OK. Have a good night. Jennie starts to walk away with her friends. \nADAM \n(TOO FRIENDLY) Hey, where ya going? She ignores him, but one of her friends quietly lags behind. \nJENNIE'S FRIEND (quietly, to Adam) Are you with that guy over there? She discretely points out Jacob. \nADAM Yeah, he's my brother. She takes Adam's PALM and writes something on it. \nJENNIE'S FRIEND There's a party later tonight at this address. Make sure he comes with you. He's way boss! Adam walks back to his friends. \nJACOB How'd it go? He shows them his palm. \nADAM We got invited to a party later. \nLOU sweet! What are we gonna do until then? \nADAM How about figure out how the hell to get back to the present day? Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile of CASH. \nNICK Bam! \nLOU We're millionaires! \nNICK Close. It's a thousand bucks. \nADAM Where did you get that money? Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen. \nNICK \n(PROUDLY) Sold them my iPod. Jacob looks incredulous. \n", "test1_true": "LOU I agree. You left so much money on the table. It's a fucking iPod! You could've gotten a LOT more! \nJACOB That's not what I-- \nADAM (looking at watch) Fellas, we are not making progress and we're losing time. \nNICK Adam, don't worry. Time's not moving forward in the future. \nJACOB Uh, yeah it is. Lest we forget the lessons learned from Bill and Ted. \nNICK Well then I give you Back to the Future. \nJACOB That's not fair. You can't go right to Back to the Future. \nNICK Why not? \nJACOB Back to the Future had a time machine. \nNICK Well so did Bill and Ted. \nADAM \n(REALIZES) Wait, that's it! I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I think we have a time machine. \nNICK Adam, all we did is get drunk in the hot tub. Everyone's EYES GO WIDE. \nLOU (puts it together) A hot tub time machine. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - EARLY EVENING \nAll four guys soak in the tub. They TOAST with drinks. \nADAM Here goes nothing! They simultaneously DOWN their drinks. Nothing happens. Like the chimps in 2001, each of them begins FIDDLING WITH KNOBS and PUSHING ON LIGHTS, trying to find the magic button. After a few moments: \nNICK Well, it was worth a shot. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal other PEOPLE in the tub. A GUY AND GIRL make out, two STONERS pass a joint, and one TOPLESS CHICK just chills out. \nLOU (stares at girl) I love this place. As Lou pours himself another, Adam starts to lose it again. \nADAM Guys, we're running out of ideas here! \n(MORE) \nADAM (CONT'D) I mean we tried the scientist, the tub -- what the fuck do we do next? Lou DOWNS ANOTHER SHOT and gets a crazy look in his eye. \nLOU I know what we do next. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING \nA DELOREAN is parked in the empty lot. Adam, Nick, and Jacob look at it, drunkenly and bleary-eyed. Adam and Nick trade swigs from a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. The gull wing door opens and Lou steps out, in a foul mood. \nLOU Rental car agency fucked us! There's no flux capacitor. Lou pulls Jacob over and straps him in the driver's seat, before walking around to the passenger side. \nLOU (CONT'D) (to Adam and Nick) We'll travel to 2010. Then one of us will come back and get one of you. And so on and so forth. \nINT. DELOREAN - EARLY EVENING \nLou sits in the passenger seat next to Jacob. \nLOU Go light on the clutch. I don't wanna lose our deposit. Jacob starts the car. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - SAME TIME \n", "test1_id": 2577, "test2_input": "JACOB Thanks. I like you guys, too. A THIRD DOUCHEBAG arrives and gives a SECRET HANDSHAKE to Tad and Chaz. He drops off a PILL BOTTLE. This is GEOFFREY (pronounced JOFF-rey). \nGEOFFREY Gentlemen. \nTAD Geoffrey, please meet Jacob. Excuse his Jewish name. He really quite exceeds it. Jacob looks confused by that, as Geoffrey shakes his hand. \nGEOFFREY Jacob, would you like some too? He offers a pill bottle. \nJACOB What is it? \nCHAZ Rohypnol. Geoffrey's father is a pharmacist, but we don't hold that against him. \nJACOB Rohypnol? \nTAD You slip it to a chick who won't go to third. Give it an hour and you'll be rounding home. \nJACOB \n(SURPRISED) This is a date rape drug. \nGEOFFREY \n(LAUGHS) What the fuck is date rape? \nJACOB These are roofies! \nCHAZ Roofies... I like that! \nTAD Yeah, it takes the clinical name right out of it. It sounds so fresh, chicks might even take it voluntarily! \n(TO JACOB) Hey, can we use that? Jacob looks beside himself. \nEXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON \nA GUY and a GIRL are using the hot tub, which is still hot and bubbly, despite the fact that it isn't plugged in. Nick and Lou sit at the table, as Adam approaches with CATS. \nADAM I got regular cats. I figured maybe the kitten was a fluke. Nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down. \nNICK Come here. He leads Adam near the tub, where Lou points at something. \nLOU There! \nADAM What am I looking at? It's some kind of stain. \nLOU Smell it. \nADAM I'm not smelling it. \nLOU \n(NODS ENCOURAGINGLY) Smell the stain. Adam puts his nose up against the stain and SNIFFS. He recognizes something, but can't put his finger on it. \nADAM What is that? \nNICK Red Bull. \nGUY IN TUB Hey, you fellas mind? I'm trying to get a handjob here. \nINT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOON \nOur guys sit and absorb the impact of what they've learned. \nADAM So you're telling me that Red Bull plus hot tub equals time travel? \nLOU \n", "test2_true": "ADAM Who the fuck is Hank Musselman? \nNICK There was just enough Red Bull for the kitten. Not nearly enough for a human. It's a weight distribution thing. \nADAM How did you even figure this out? \nLOU Scientific method. \nNICK He bet me 20 dollars I wouldn't lick the stain. \nLOU I thought it was some guy's jizz. \nADAM What's wrong with you? \nLOU It worked, didn't it? \nNICK Yeah, except one little problem. There's no Red Bull in 1987. For a moment, they're all bummed again. Then Adam gets an encouraged look on his face. \nADAM Yes there is! Come on! Adam heads for the door, as Lou and Nick follow. \nEXT. BUNNY SLOPE - DAY \nJennie instructs a group of TEENAGERS on the basics of skiing, as Adam approaches, with Nick and Lou in tow. \nJENNIE \n(CONCERNED) You can't be here. If Blaine sees you, he'll snap your neck. I told him I blew you and he's not happy. \nADAM Why would you do that?! Behind Adam, Nick looks at the group of TEENS and his eyes almost BUG OUT. He elbows Lou. \nNICK (whispers, teeth clenched) Look. Lou looks to where Nick is looking: YOUNG ADAM, YOUNG NICK, and YOUNG LOU wait with other kids for Jennie to return to their lesson. \nLOU Holy shit! Lou immediately approaches the kids, even as Nick tries to hold him back. \nNICK \n(TEETH CLENCHED) where the fuck are you going?! Lou walks right up to his YOUNGER SELF and looks himself square in the face. \nYOUNG LOU What the hell do you want, old man? Lou PUNCHES his YOUNGER SELF in the face. Young Nick and Young Adam are freaked out, as is regular Nick. Adam doesn't notice, as he's arguing with Jennie. \nYOUNG LOU (CONT'D) What the fuck, dude?! I think you broke my nose! My parents are gonna sue the shit out of you! \nLOU Herschel and Evelyn aren't gonna do a damn thing. They're losers. \nYOUNG LOU How do you know my parents? \nLOU Listen to me. Start putting minoxidil on your scalp. Tonight. Then, when Propecia comes on the market, start taking it. Every day. Hair is important. \nYOUNG LOU I don't give a shit about hair. \nLOU You will! (leans in, quietly) Or I'll tell everyone about how you jerked off to that issue of Playgirl. \nYOUNG LOU \n(QUIETLY) It was confusing! There were naked people and it had \"girl\" in the title! \nLOU Hey, you don't have to justify to me, pal. \nYOUNG LOU \n(FREAKED OUT) Who are you? \nLOU I'm God. \nON ADAM AND JENNIE \n", "test2_id": 2578, "test3_input": "LOU I don't hate you as much as I used to. \nJACOB (a little emotional) I hate you a little less also. Lou LIFTS BLAINE'S LIMP BODY. \nADAM OK, whenever you're ready, Lou. \nLOU One small step for man! One giant asshole puking in a hot tub! Here goes nothing! Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER on Blaine. It takes ONE... TWO... THREE THRUSTS until Blaine PUKES IN THE TUB! For a second, it's just a BIG SPLASH of VOMIT and nothing else. \nNICK OK, well maybe if we-- A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES THE SCREEN! And when it dies down, we see Adam, Nick, Jacob (and the floating puke) in the hot tub where we left them. Only Lou is missing. \nADAM What happened? Did it work? \nNICK I didn't feel anything. \nJACOB \n(DISAPPOINTED) Guys, look. They see PEOPLE walking by, wearing COLORFUL FLARED-OUT SKI ATTIRE. The place looks the same as it did two seconds ago. \nNICK Dammit. Even the deck furniture's the same. We fucking blew it. It didn't work. \nADAM Where's Lou? \nLOU (O.S.) Right on schedule! Lou walks toward them, but there's a lot that's \"off\" about him, including HAIR PLUGS, JEWELRY, and a SHITLOAD OF PLASTIC SURGERY (including a fixed NOSE) that makes him look at once older and younger. \nNICK Ahhh! \nLOU Oh, the face, eh? I was curious how you'd react. \n(DISAPPOINTED) Didn't think you'd be scared. \nADAM Lou? \nLOU You're damn right it's me. \nADAM What happened? \nLOU You just traveled 23 years in three seconds. Took me 23 years. It's good to see you guys! \nJACOB We're back? It all looks the same. \nLOU It better! You know how much I pay the groundspeople around here? A lot. But that's all right, I'm fucking loaded. Look at all this. Everyone looks confused. \nADAM Will you fill in some of the blanks for me, please? \nLOU I'll give you the short version, because time is of the essence. First of all, to settle an old bet, time most definitely has been moving forward. It is exactly three days since you've arrived here in beautiful Havenhurst. Jacob looks at Nick. \nJACOB Told you. \nLOU Secondly, I'm filthy rich. Made sports bets. Sued Ace of Base. I own most of V ermont. (MORE) \nLOU (CONT'D) I've been reimagining the state as my own personal playground. You could say I'm a little bit like Michael Jackson, except I don't fuck kids. Two YOUNG HOTTIES walk by and wave at Lou. \nLOU (CONT'D) I do fuck them, though. Haven't gone above 24 years old in 10 years and even then, it was a mistake. \n(REMEMBERING) A horrible mistake. \nADAM Wait, fuck, Lou what time is it? \nLOU Way ahead of you, Adam. You have 2 hours to get to New Jersey in time for your rehearsal dinner. \nADAM \n(DISAPPOINTED) Great, I blew it. \nLOU Not even a little bit. I have a helicopter waiting in the parking lot and a private jet on my airfield five minutes away. The guys look stunned. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. PRIVATE AIRFIELD - AFTERNOON \nLou's private jet takes off from the runway. \nINT. PRIVATE JET - AFTERNOON \nThe guys sit back and enjoy the plush surroundings and the beautiful FLIGHT ATTENDANTS aboard Lou's jet. \nLOU By the way, Adam, I hope you don't mind. Right after you left, I fucked Jennie silly. \nADAM Why would she have sex with you? \nLOU You get the big time assist. All that talk of her finding the right guy who's willing to give up everything? Made her wetter than a log flume. \n(SMILES) She's all-time top five. \nADAM Good to hear. \nNICK Lou, I gotta ask you something. \nLOU Time travel paradox. \nNICK Exactly. Aren't there now two of you living here in 2010? \nLOU Think really hard about that one. What happened to me when I was 19? Nick shrugs. He looks at Adam. Suddenly, both their eyes nearly pop out of their skulls. \nNICK No way... \nADAM You went missing and were never found. \nLOU Yeah, you're gonna have some lingering memories of both versions. \nADAM Wait a minute, what happened to... you know. Other Lou. \nLOU You don't wanna know. \nADAM Lou... \nLOU The kid sucked, OK? He couldn't take even a little bit of direction. Pretty soon I realized that having two versions of the same dude walking around -- as cool as that sounds -- didn't make very much sense to me. \nNICK \nOK? \nLOU So I took care of the problem. \nNICK What did you do? \nLOU I had to do it. \nADAM What did you do? \nLOU I killed myself. \nADAM Jesus Christ. \nLOU Yeah, it was really some existential shit. I mean, here I am committing homicide and I'm actually committing suicide. \nNICK How could you? \nLOU It was easy actually. For a minute, I thought I might be dealing with that whole Timecop thing. You know, the same matter can't occupy the same space at the same time bullshit and we both go poof? Especially after that whole nose thing. But no, it was just a murder. I didn't suffer. \nADAM I don't wanna hear any more. \nLOU It was strangulation. \n", "test3_id": 2579}

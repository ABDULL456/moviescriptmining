JESSE That's fucked up. 
LARGE Yeah... So I definitely wanna come by and check out your new pad. You gotta tell me what happened. 
JESSE Basically, "The Man bought my silent Velcro patent. 
LARGE What? 
JESSE Well you knew I was an inventor right? 
LARGE No. But I haven't seen you since we 
WERE SIXTEEN- 
JESSE Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an inventor yet. Anyway I developed this little item that's just like Velcro but doesn't make that annoying Velcro noise. 
LARGE now much did they buy it for? 
JESSE A lot. 
LARGE Wow. So what are you doing now? 
JESSE Nothing. They laugh. 
LARGE Seriously. 
JESSE Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've never been so bored in all my life. The first month I bought a whole bunch of shit, but then that got boring. But I... nothing. 
LARGE That's so crazy. But I mean like, are you gonna travel or like what are you gonna do? Shouldn't you like help starving kids or something? 
JESSE I'm not really motivated to do much at all. It's kind of funny, I guess I had kind of planned on my whole life being about struggling to get money. But now that I've got more than I ever dreamed, I'm really not sure what to do with myself. I stare at walls a lot. 
DAVE Can you believe that shit, Large? This guy has one idea and he's a trillionaire. I got a thousand ideas, but I gotta sit around and wait for all my relatives to die. They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book. Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty young; 17-19. As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on. 
MARK Here, bro. He passes Large the golf book. 
LARGE Oh no thanks, man. 
MARK Really? But you're like a movie star and shit. 
LARGE No, no thanks. 
JESSE Well then here. Eat this. Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY FACE on it. 
JESSE (CONT'D) Welcome home. 
Large takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks around at everyone else in the room eating them; including the cute girls. 
LARGE I guess I'll see youguyslater. He eats the hit. They laugh. 
DANA Should we play a game? 
DAVE other than golf? They laugh. 
KELLY No, let's play Spin The Bottle. The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group. 
LARGE 
(TO JESSE) I'm not playing Spin The Bottle; how old are we? or more importantly, how old are they? Jesse passes Large the joint. 
JESSE They're all legal. I think. He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy voice takes control. 
KELLY Well we just ate all this fuckin' ex, what the hell else are we gonna do? 
JESSE The girl has a point. 
MARK Okay, how 'bout this. He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to neck. 
MARK (CONT'D} First let's finish Daddy's golf tequila. Then we can use this bottle. The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv start. 
THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED- 
UP AND SLOW MOTION. The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name. 
ALL Large! He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed directly at him. 
JESSE Largeman, this is Dana. Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room.

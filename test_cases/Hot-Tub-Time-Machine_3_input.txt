JENNIE I know. You don't look like you could handle power tools. 
ADAM The truth is, Jennie, I've always liked you. But I've never really known you. I really wasn't supposed to meet you again. 
JENNIE Who are you?! Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her. 
ADAM I came here from the future. She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners. 
JENNIE Let me guess. You want to beam me up to your spaceship built for two? Or maybe you're wondering if these are astronaut pants? 
ADAM Astronaut pants? 
JENNIE Because my ass is out of this world? Give me a break, spaz. I've heard them all. She turns away. Adam goes after her. 
ADAM No! No spaceship. No astronaut pants. Just regular time travel. With normal pants. 
JENNIE OK, what's the punch line? An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine. 
BLAINE I thought I told you to stay off my mountain, partner! 
JENNIE Blaine, stop! 
BLAINE You talking to my girl? Huh? I can't hear you. Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder. 
JENNIE Blaine, that's enough! Let him go! He can't breathe! Blaine doesn't stop. He smiles like an asshole. 
BLAINE Can't breathe? Is that right? Can you breathe, partner? What's that? I can't hear you. Just tell me you can't breathe and I'll stop. Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs. 
BLAINE (CONT'D) He's not saying anything. I guess he can breathe. Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam. 
BLAINE (CONT'D) Babe, stop. Jennie, stop! Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She goes down. He releases Adam and turns to help her. 
BLAINE (CONT'D) Baby, I'm sorry. (turns to Adam) See what you made me do?! 
JENNIE Screw you, Blaine! Jennie gets up. She grabs Adam's arm and YANKS HIM along with her, as she storms away. 
JENNIE (CONT'D) 
(TO ADAM) Come on, let's go! Blaine looks ON FIRE, as he watches Jennie leave with Adam. 
LOU (V.0.) Sandy, I don't know what you did with this wine, but it is delightful. 
INT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 
Jacob and Lou sit with Michelle and Sandy back at the girls' apartment. The whole place looks like a Madonna concert. 
Jacob looks uncomfortable, but Lou pours on the polite charm. 
SANDY It's from a box. There's lots! 
LOU Mmm. Fantastic. 
(QUICK TURN) Do you mind if I borrow my friend? We'll only be a moment. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Lou has Jacob PINNED AGAINST THE WALL with his arm. He speaks quietly, but with purpose. 
LOU You're gonna fuck her! 
JACOB I'm not gonna have sex with her. She killed a guy! 
LOU That guy was undesirable. You heard her. It was about the money.

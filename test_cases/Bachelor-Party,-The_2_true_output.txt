ANOTHER SHOT of the five carousers, Walter whistling at two passing girls. 
ARNOLD Long may we cherish thee Faithful we'll be. Clinton, oh, Clinton For you and me ... Da-da-da-da-da ... Crash through that line of blue And send the backs around the end. 
EDDIE There he goes with those fullbacks again.

DISSOLVE TO: 
EXTERIOR. GREENWICH AVENUE AND TENTH STREET -- NIGHT 
GROUP SHOT of our five carousers paused on the curb, waiting for the lights to change in their favor. Greenwich Avenue traffic is pretty heavy, going in both directions. The five men are kind of strung out along the curb with Charlie being the last in line. Standing beside him, also waiting for the light to change, is a good-looking, well-dressed, chic young woman of twenty-four or five. 
KENNETH Where we going? Eddie's place to see movies? 
ARNOLD What movies? 
EDDIE Boy, just wait till you see these movies! Hey, Charlie, hey Charlie ... 
CHARLIE What? 
EDDIE (indicating the young woman) Who's your beautiful friend, Charlie? 
Charlie turns and regards the pretty young woman. 
CHARLIE (to the girl) Excuse me. My friend down there wants to know who you are. 
The young woman, who for our own mysterious purposes we shall refer to as The Existentialist, regards the five reasonably tight young men all staring at her. Kenneth has already begun to giggle. 
THE EXISTENTIALIST (with a Mona Lisa smile) Where are you all from, out-of-town? 
CHARLIE Indiana. (turning to the others) Isn't that right, fellers? We're from Indiana, right? 
EDDIE Indiana! Indiana, man! 
Kenneth and Arnold, to whom this incident is already unbearably funny, have turned away and are clutching their sides, trying to suppress a fit of giggles. 
CHARLIE (to The Existentialist) We're from the Hoosier State, ma'am... 
WALTER Terre Haute! We're from Terre Haute!

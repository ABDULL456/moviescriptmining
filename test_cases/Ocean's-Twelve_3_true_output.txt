TURK Can't we just get a telephone repair truck... 
49   AMSTERDAM PLANNING MONTAGE (CONTINUOUS)                       49 
TURK (V.O.) ...put the basket up and use a telescoping rod through the open window to tap out the guy's code? 
Turk's idea plays out as it is in his MIND'S EYE, until: 
RUSTY (V.O.) The street in front of the house is blocked off to vehicles. 
DANNY (V.O.) And it's covered by five independently-wired surveillance cameras.... 
RUSTY (V.O.) Monitored 24-hours a day by a security company. 
We SEE the security arrangements they describe. 
50   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- THE PLANNING SESSION (CONTINUOUS)         50 
SAUL God, this guy really is a freak. 
BASHER Crazy freak. 
Frank reacts again to the term "freak."   It really bothers him.   Danny notices. 
DANNY Something wrong? 
FRANK Just...don't call the guy a freak, okay? 
Everyone turns and looks at Frank like he's a freak. 
FRANK (cont'd) What? 
The entire room is staring at him. 
(CONTINUED) 
50   CONTINUED:                                                      50 
FRANK (cont'd) What?! I mean, am I the only one here who feels funny about stealing from a...a...handicapped guy? 
Danny looks to one side of the room...then the other. 
DANNY Yeah. 
The rest of the room agrees. Matter closed.    Everyone just turns back to what they're doing. 
DANNY (cont'd) Okay, so we know what we can't do... 
Frank stews. 
DANNY (cont'd) Time to think outside the box, guys. 
A beat.   Everyone thinks.    Then: 
LINUS Okay, here's something...I've got an idea...suppose we-- 
RUSTY No. 
LINUS Well, but how-- 
RUSTY There's a Goldmann Grid over the enitre surface. 
Linus looks at him. 
RUSTY (cont'd) Is that what you were thinking about? 
Linus nods. 
DANNY (sudden idea) But.... 
(CONTINUED) 
50   CONTINUED: (2)                                             50 
RUSTY --Well, that's different. Especially if we-- 
Rusty makes a circular motion with his finger and then stops it with his other hand. 
DANNY Right. 
LINUS What? 
RUSTY (quick aside to Linus) A Schuman Special. (then to Livingston) Livingston-- 
LIVINGSTON Absolutely. I mean, I'd need a day to-- 
RUSTY You'll have three. Basher? 
BASHER No worries. 
RUSTY Virgil, Turk. 
VIRGIL. Just gotta get the gear. 
TURK Sweden. 
RUSTY Yen? 
Yen says something in Chinese. 
RUSTY (cont'd) What, and give up show business? Saul--

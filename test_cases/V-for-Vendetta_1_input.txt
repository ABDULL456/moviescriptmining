Finch starts it again and this time the tape is very fuzzy. 
FINCH What is it? 
DOMINIC 23rd Psalm. 
We recognize some of the words though muted and crackly. 
TAPE (V.O.) Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... 
DOMINIC It goes on like that for a while. Fairly incoherent except we could make out a few words in this part. Transubstantiation. 
Finch nods, understanding. 
DOMINIC That miracle business when the wafer transform into the body of Christ. 
FINCH He made him eat a host. 
DOMINIC Yes, listen to this part. 
The tape becomes somewhat clearer as the music rests. 
TAPE (V.O.) ... And at the moment this enters your mouth it becomes the flesh of the savior?  Yes... please... And whatever it is made of now it will become the body of Christ?  Yes... yes... 
They eye each other. 
TAPE (V.O.) I want you to swallow it. 
DOMINIC There's a couple of funny human noises... 
FINCH And then just Beethoven's fifth. 
He shuts off the tape. 
FINCH We have got the initial path report back.  The host was full of cyanide. 
Finch picks up the bag with the violet carson. 
FINCH And do you know what? 
He rises, sliding into his jacket. 
FINCH When it reached his abdomen, it was still cyanide. 
INT.  MORGUE 
Close on the heavy stitching of a "Y" incision sewn into the chest of a corpse.  It is one of the Bishop's guards. 
DELIA Do you have a motive? 
Finch is standing next to the cadaver gurney with the coroner, Delia Surridge.  She is a serious woman, hair wound tight behind her head in a severe bun. 
DELIA I mean, was anything taken? 
She fills the dead man's head with cotton and replaces the top of his skull. 
FINCH Just lives. 
Pulling at the man's scalp, she stretches it over the replaced skull piece. 
FINCH I know it's too early for your profile but do you have any initial impressions? 
DELIA Well... 
She points at a jagged puncture wound at the base of the man's sternum with a ball point pen. 
DELIA He's incredibly powerful.  This man's sternum was split like dry wood from the base all the way up to the manubrium. 
Finch peers into the hole. 
DELIA And he's resourceful.  On that table behind you is a breakdown of all the chemicals found in Prothero's blood stream. 
Finch hefts the pile of computer paper. 
FINCH Bloody hell. 
DELIA There were hundreds of different chemicals in him.  From trinitrotoluene to estrogen to motor oil. 
He flips through the document, biting into the wooden end of his pipe. 
FINCH Perhaps Fate will make something more of all this.  I certainly can't. 
DELIA The Leader finally authorized an uplink for you?  He must be getting nervous. 
FINCH Quite.  Government directed terrorism never sews healthy ideas into the public.  Oh, that reminds me. 
Finch pulls the evidence bag from his pocket. 
FINCH Can you tell us anything about this? 
Delia's eyes lock onto the violet carson. 
FINCH We found one in the carriage with Prothero and this one in the Bishop's quarters.  A violet carson. 
He hands it to her. 
FINCH I heard that strain had died off. Thought a botanist might shed some light on it.  Delia? 
Delia, riveted to the rose, suddenly looks up to him. 
DELIA Yes -- Yes, of course. 
FINCH Magic.  I'll drop by tomorrow then. 
He turns, leaving her with the rose. 
INT.  SHADOW GALLERY 
V relaxes with a book in an overstuffed reading chair, a violet carson rose resting on a table next to him.  He begins to read a passage aloud. 
V "There is more behind and inside of V than any of us had suspected. Not who, but what: what is she?"

Derek's drunk eyes light up. 
DEREK Oh god, yes!  God, thank you! 
He slams the phone down, charging out of the room. 
EXT.  KITTY KAT KELLER 
A gaggle of drunks exit the bar, laughing and singing as they pass a small figure. 
INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER 
Evey wanders into the bar amidst the lustful screams and cat calls for the line of high stepping, semi-clothed girls on stage. 
She stares out into the crowd, not sure why she is here when a man approaches her: Creedy.  His sloppy smile indicates he has had a few drinks. 
CREEDY You look lost. 
She looks blankly at him. 
CREEDY Can I buy you a drink? 
EVEY No... I made a mistake. 
She turns for the door. 
EVEY I have to find someone. 
Creedy frowns as his radio crackles. 
CREEDY Well I didn't like the looks of you anyway -- 
RADIO (V.O.) All units, all units.  Code red. Converge in Plaistow to apprehend codename V. 
CREEDY Bloody hell! 
He screams to the Fingermen at the back. 
CREEDY It's him!  We got him! 
Evey watches as they storm out of the bar, then follows. 
EXT.  CITY STREET 
The emergency lights blaring, Finch's car squeals around a corner. 
INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM 
V hovers ghostly at Delia's bedside. 
DELIA It's funny, I was given one of your roses today.  I wasn't sure you were the terrorist until I saw it. 
She manages a smile. 
DELIA What a strange coincidence.  That I should be given it today. 
V There are no coincidences, Delia. Only the illusion of coincidence. 
He reaches into his cloak. 
V I have another rose.  This one is for you. 
He hands it to her. 
DELIA Then you are going to kill me now? 
V produces an empty syringe. 
V I killed you ten minutes ago. While you slept. 
DELIA Is there any pain? 
V sits on the bed. 
V No.  No pain. 
DELIA Thank you. 
She stares at the mask. 
DELIA Can I -- Can I see your face again? 
V slowly pulls off his hat and lifts his mask.  Delia stares into his face. 
DELIA It's beautiful... 
The rose falls from her hands. 
INT.  HALL 
V quietly shuts the door as if not to wake her and turns just as -- 
Derek Almond reaches the top of the stairs. 
DEREK Don't move an inch, you bloody bastard. 
He trains his gun. 
DEREK You didn't hear me arrive, did you? Didn't know we'd rumbled you? 
He squints. 
DEREK It's all finished, chummy.  All of it.  The old man told me it was my head or yours and what do you know. It's yours. 
The smiling mask stares. 
DEREK Because you're standing over there with your bloody stupid knives and your fancy karate gimmicks -- 
Derek pulls back the hammer. 
DEREK And I've got a gun.

BARBARA Why, thank you... 
INT. AIRPORT CHECK IN DESK - LAX. MORNING 
Stanley is standing at the Airport Airlines check-in desk, facing the check-in clerk. 
STANLEY Parsons. 
The clerk checks her paperwork. 
CHECK-IN CLERK You've just arrived from New Orleans, mister Parsons? 
STANLEY Yes. 
CHECK-IN CLERK And you're flying directly back to New Orleans? On the same plane? 
STANLEY That is correct. 
The clerk awaits an explanation, but none is forthcoming. She raises an eyebrow. 
CHECK-IN CLERK Okay. Well, enjoy your stay at Los Angeles Airport, Mister Parsons. 
CON TINUE D: 
STANLEY Thank you. 
Stanley turns to go, but then pauses. 
STANLEY (CONT'D) I've come to pick up my son's body. 
The line behind him falls quiet, and the officious clerk wobbles slightly. Stanley raises his voice. 
STANLEY (CONT'D) My son died out here, you see? So I've come to bring him home. Everyone looks at Stanley.            Stanley looks at the clerk. 
STANLEY (CONT'D) I'm wondering if that's enough information for you? 
CHECK-IN CLERK Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. We'll... see to it that you get every assistance on your journey, sir. 
STANLEY Most kind. 
INT. BANK. MORNING 
There is a line leading to the information desk, but Barbara ignores it. She walks up to a female teller, who is serving another customer, and cuts in. BARBARA I'd like to see the manager, please. 
CUSTOMER Wait your turn. 
Barbara's eyes immediately water, and her lower lip trembles. 
BARBARA I'm sorry. It's just that the man I loved died yesterday. I was forgetting my manners... 
She dabs at her eyes with a lace handkerchief.           The customer looks embarrassed. 
CUSTOMER I'm sorry.     Please... go ahead. 
CON TINUE D: 
Barbara fixes the teller with a no-nonsense look.   The teller responds with a similar look. 
BARBARA The manager? 
EXT. MORTUARY. MORNING 
A man unlocks the shutters with a clatter and goes inside. 
INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING 
The sound wakes Phil, who glances around and stretches, before getting out of the car. 
EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING Phil walks over to the door and walks inside the mortuary. 
INT. MORTUARY. MORNING 
The clerk busies himself opening up. Phil wanders around and knocks into a coffin. The lid bangs closed and the sound echoes around the hangar. 
CLERK Can I help you? 
PHIL I'm here to pick up a... coffin.

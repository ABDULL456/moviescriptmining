WILLIAMSON Now, I'm giving you three... 
ROMA Three?  I count two. 
WILLIAMSON Three. 
ROMA Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads. 
Shelly Levene enters. 
LEVENE Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View... 
ROMA You sold eight Mountain View? 
LEVENE You bet your ass.  Who wants to go to lunch?  Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying. (slaps contract down on Williamson's desk) Eighty-two fucking grand.  And twelve grand in commission.  John. (pause) On fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads. 
WILLIAMSON Who? 
LEVENE (pointing to contract) Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg. (looking around) What happened here? 
AARONOW Fuck.  I had them on River Glen. 
Levene looks around. 
LEVENE What happened? 
WILLIAMSON Somebody broke in. 
ROMA Eight units? 
LEVENE That's right. 
ROMA Shelly...! 
LEVENE Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak... 
AARONOW Shelly, the Machine, Levene. 
LEVENE You... 
AARONOW That's great. 
LEVENE Thank you, George. 
Baylen sticks his head out of the room; calls in, "Aaronow." Aaronow goes into the side room. 
LEVENE Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch... 
ROMA They took the phones... 
LEVENE They... 
BAYLEN Aaronow...

TONY (stunned) My God! That's it! You're right! Anthony Shepherd! They call me Tony. Tony Shepherd! That's who I am! 
VALENTINA and ANTON begin to pay attention and gather around. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS And... you used to do good works. Something to do with charity I think. 
TONY Yes...That's right! That's right! But how?... 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (dismissively) It's an ancient technique of mental divination, but I'm very rusty and it doesn't always work satisfactorily. 
TONY But that's amazing! Brilliant! (oddly concerned) Was there anything else? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS shakes his head, no. 
TONY (CONT'D) (relieved) That's absolutely fantastic! Thank you. Perhaps I'll remember other things. 
PARNASSUS smiles and bows slightly ironically.

VALENTINA Charity work? I knew you were a good person. 
PERCY So what was he doing dangling under a bridge from his neck? 
VALENTINA Percy! 
PERCY (sarcastic) Oh dear, was that a rude question? Have I put my foot in it? 
TONY That's so strange. And horrible.. it's a complete blank. But I do remember I was involved in some sort of charity.. trying to do good, to make the world a better place, you know...inspire people, give them hope.... (self deprecatingly) What an arrogant idiot. 
VALENTINA looks at him thinking `what a sympathetic person.' 
The sound of a flutey whistle distracts him. ANTON is blowing a tune on the metal tube he found on the bridge. 
TONY (CONT'D) What's that? 
ANTON (with a superior air) Mozart's flute concerto in G. 
TONY I mean, the pipe. Where did you get it? 
ANTON looks at the metal pipe. 
ANTON I found it. 
TONY It's mine.

ANTON Oh. You're a musician n-now. 
TONY It's not a musical instrument. May I have it?... Please. 
ANTON (teasing) Are you s-sure it's yours? 
TONY Positive. 
ANTON Alright. 
ANTON appears to offer the pipe to TONY but palms it so that when TONY reaches out to take it, it's gone. 
ANTON (CONT'D) It's g-gone. 
TONY (getting shirty) Don't fool around. 
ANTON Ah, there it is. 
TONY once more tries to take it. Once more ANTON makes it disappear. 
TONY (angry) Give it to me! 
ANTON (derisively) Oooooh! 
VALENTINA Anton, that's enough. 
She steps forward, takes the pipe from ANTON and gives it to TONY. 
TONY Thank you. 
DR. PARNASSUS, who's been watching this exchange, looks thoughtful. 
43   EXT   THE WAGON      NIGHT                                  43 
PARNASSUS and CO are preparing to move out and do a show. 
ANTON is working near PARNASSUS and PERCY who are unaware of his presence. 
DR. PARNASSUS What's eating Anton? 
ANTON pricks up his ears.

{"test1_input": "ROYCE (blowing a sigh) I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen. \nJORDAN Which is guy-speak for... \nROYCE (conceding) Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you. \nJORDAN You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know. \nWounded, she gets out. \nROYCE Jordan... \nJORDAN Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much. \nShe punches into a robe and leaves.  Royce considers drowning himself in the tub. \nEXT.  CORONADO BRIDGE - SAN DIEGO - DAY \nJordan drives a top-down Mustang across the sweeping Coronado Bridge, cityscape behind her, naval base ahead. \nA flock of pelicans pace Jordan alongside the bridge. Suddenly two NAVY HELOS BLAST overhead, scattering the pelicans. \nEXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nOn base, Jordan carries a gunnysack across an asphalt courtyard.  The is \"the grinder,\" reminiscent of a gladiator's arena.  She notices at one end... \nA silver ship's bell.  Hung prominently. \nINT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nJORDAN Excuse me, lieutenant.  I was told this is where I check in. \nA DUTY OFFICER looks up to find Jordan across a counter. In no particular hurry, the duty officer makes his way over to check Jordan's orders. \nDUTY OFFICER (looking up) So you're the one. \nHearing, other workers look up.  Among them is a female ensign, KATHY BLONDELL -- no makeup, no nail polish, no concession to her sex.  Throughout, she'll watch Jordan with more than passing interest. \nJORDAN Still don't have my bearings yet. Direct me to the officer's quarters? \nThe duty officer stamps her paperwork, returns it with room assignment and keys. \nDUTY OFFICER You'll proceed directly to the infirmary for eye tests, blood tests, urinalysis, pregnancy test. Uniform issue adjacent.  Then you're to report to the Base Commander. He'd like a word with you. \nJORDAN Fine.  And the officer's quarters? \nDUTY OFFICER C.O.'s office can supply you with directions.  Enjoy your visit, lieutenant. \nIt's a nasty little barb -- one that Jordan decides to let slide.  Jordan turns for the door.  Blondell catches up with a base map. \nBLONDELL B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door. \nJORDAN Thank you, ensign. \nBLONDELL No problem, lieutenant. \nINT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nA soft KNOCKING. \nC.O. Come. \nA YEOMAN opens the door.  Behind him is Jordan. \nYEOMAN Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil reporting, sir. \nFor a beat, COMMANDING OFFICER (C.O.) TURRENTINE takes stock of the female in his doorway, sizing her up like a fighter across the ring.  Then he stubs out a perfectly good cigar, rises with an amiable face, and touches the back of a chair -- stopping just short of pulling it out for her. \nC.O. Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant... \nJORDAN Thank you, sir. \nC.O. Would you care for a beverage?  Tea? \nJORDAN I'm fine, sir. \nC.O. So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you. \nJORDAN Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain. \n", "test1_true": "JORDAN Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only -- \nC.O. Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask. \nJORDAN Really, I have no problem with -- \nC.O. I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions? \nJORDAN None at this time, sir. \nC.O. Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed. \nAnother smile, another phantom gesture on the back of her chair.  If Jordan was expecting a fight, the bell never sounded.  She rises, salutes -- then turns back at the door. \nJORDAN Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect. \nC.O. If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we? (a beat) Take your leave. \nEXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nThe Spec-Recon TRAINEES loiter outside their open rooms, pumping weights, hosing down dive gear, trading Walkman tapes.  This is the last day of liberty they'll have for a long time. \nMILLER What am I scannin' here? \nOther eyes quickly lock in on... \nJordan.  Across a grass courtyard, she walks the ground floor of an identical building, trying to match key number to room number.  Every door is open, every room empty. Soon she feels the presence of... \nThe men.  They're disgorging from their rooms -- ten, twenty, thirty of them -- all buffed and cut.  These guys are what Hitler saw in his dreams. \nJordan picks up her pace.  Where the hell is her room? \nOn all three levels of their building, the men shadow Jordan en masse.  Not hooting.  Not leering.  Just assessing. \nJordan finds her room at the far corner of the building: She's got the entire floor to herself.  With a last look over her shoulder, Jordan vanishes inside. \nEXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nC.O. Special Reconnaissance.  Here you will be trained to infiltrate hostile territory... to be the real- time eyes on the ground... to recover assigned targets and, if need be, to fight your way out under adverse conditions. \nCAMERA SURVEYS faces of the trainees:  MILLER, MCCOOL, SLUTNIK, CORTEZ, FLEA, STAMM, ENGLAND, NEWBERRY, WICKWIRE. We'll get to know them later.  Dressed in Navy greens, they stand in formation -- ten rows, ten deep, helmets in hand.  Pacing before them: \nC.O. That is all that will be said about the special nature of this class -- by us or by you.  Many of you have waited years for admission to this program.  Opportunities like this are rare -- and those who seize upon them are rarer still. \nHe approaches Jordan.  We can tell what she's thinking. \"Just keep moving.  Don't single me out.\" \nC.O. Other than that, there is little to be said but \"Good luck, gentleman.\" (correcting) \"Gentlepersons.\" \nJordan flinches. \nC.O. Now I turn you over to the chief training officer.  He has earned six naval commendations, the purple heart, and the Navy Cross for heroism and valor.  I give you Master Chief John James Urgayle. \nTaking over, THE CHIEF stands before the class a moment, sizing them up while giving them -- get an eyeload of him, too:  His body is 30 years old, his face 40, his eyes 50. An ageless warrior.  Somewhere, the blood of Ulysses runs in this guy's veins. \nThe Chief lifts a bullhorn to deliver his opening salvo -- and it's anything but the kick-ass rant the class is expecting: \nTHE CHIEF The sun and moon... the ebb and flow of the Pacific tides... global warming... the very angle of the Earth upon its axis... these are just some of the things I control in my world. \nTrainees swap private looks. \nMCCOOL We're fucked. \nSLUTNIK Darth Vader reads poetry... \nMCCOOL We are so fucked. \nEXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - DAY \nSTART on boots, crashing through shallow surf, spraying water.  We assume this is a routine beach run -- until VIEW RISES to reveal... \nTelephone poles on their shoulder.  Working in groups of 10, trainees labor under 300-pound poles.  Jordan, six inches shorter than most, looks like Atlas carrying the weight of the world.  But she's doing it. \nINSTRUCTOR Count down... one, two... count down... three, four... \nCLASS CADENCE One, two, three, four... One, two, three, four... \nAn ambulance shadows the class.  Perched on the front bumper like an hood-ornament, the Chief keeps working his bullhorn: \n", "test1_id": 2049, "test2_input": "THE CHIEF You may think that you are the brightest, the best, the strongest. I assure you, that is a total delusion on your part.  It is my job to show you just how weak human beings can truly be.  60 percent of you will not finish this course. How do I know?  Because that is an historical fact. \nIt's also intimidating shit. \nTHE CHIEF Poles down. \nThe earth literally shakes as the phone poles hit the damp sand.  Approaching on foot, the Chief loads fresh batteries into his bullhorn.  He does it like a man thumbing rounds into a shotgun. \nTHE CHIEF Now for the bad new:  I always like to get one quitter on the first day. And until I do, the first day does not end.  So look around right now -- go on, do it.  I wonder who it's gonna be... \nHe passes right by Jordan, never meeting her eyes. INSTRUCTOR PYRO steps up.  He's the Chief's bulldog. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Down to BVDs! \nThe guys strip down to boxers.  Jordan settles for boxers and jog bra. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Now face the Pacific... link arms... and take a stroll! \nThe class wades in.  The first wave takes Jordan's breath away:  It's February, and the water is cold.  When they move out of instructors' earshot: \nSTAMM What is it with the damn phone poles?  We sign up for Spec-Recon or GTE? \nWICKWIRE Just trying to thin the herd. That's all they want to do right now. \nSome of the guys are glancing Jordan's way, cashing in on a cheap wet T-shirt contest.  Jordan covers herself instinctively -- and hates the instinct.  Modesty isn't going to get her through this. \nSLUTNIK Man.  Doesn't she know it's rude to point? \nNEWBERRY Wow.  You see that girl? \nWICKWIRE I got eyes, Newberry. \nSLUTNIK One night.  Just one night in my room, she'd forget all about playin' commando. \nENGLAND Tone that shit down, Slutnik.  You heard with they said. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Out of the water! \nThe class breaks for the beach. \nTHE CHIEF Now make like sugar cookies and roll in the sand for me. \nThe trainees hit their bellies and roll.  Indeed, they look like sugar cookies. \nTHE CHIEF Collect those poles, gentlemen. Still a lotta beachfront you haven't seen... \nGroaning, the trainees grab poles.  Jordan's pole, wet slips from their collective grasp... \nAnd bangs Stamm's ankle.  He HOWLS through his teeth. \nENGLAND How bad?  Stamm? \nJORDAN We better get a medic over -- \nSTAMM No, goddamnit.  No. \nINSTRUCTOR Up!  Up!  Up!  Up! \nStamm swallows the pain.  Poles go back on shoulders. Looking like drunk centipedes, the class staggers off down the beach. \nEXT.  MUD PIT - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nWallowing in mud, the class does belly-busters, atomic sit-ups -- and the sadistic reverse push-up, where trainees lie of their backs, place hands under shoulder blades and push their crotches skyward. \nTHE CHIEF Pain is your friend.  You ally.  It will keep you awake in times of emergency... it will tell you when you are seriously injured... it will keep you angry and remind you to finish the job and get the hell home.  But you know the best thing about pain? \nCLASS No, sir! \nTHE CHIEF It lets you know that you aren't dead yet. \nInstructors roam, RASPING ORDERS, kicking students into proper position.  Jordan struggles with the reverses. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Go regulation if you can't do the reverses, O'Neil. \nShe looks around.  A lot of the guys are having trouble with the reverses, not just her. \nJORDAN Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil. \n", "test2_true": "INSTRUCTOR PYRO You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation. \nShe switches to standard push-ups, her face disappearing into the ooze with every downstroke.  Soon the Chief's boots slosh into FRAME.  He's still looking for his human sacrifice. \nTHE CHIEF Who's it gonna be.  I just wonder, who is it gonna be... \nEXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - SUNSET \nINSTRUCTOR JOHNS On your belly... on your back... on your feet... on your belly... on your back... on your feet... \nWhistle-drills.  Silhouetted against a lowering sun, the students flop around like docked fish. \nINT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nBlondell is ending her shift.  She shoulders a purse and pauses at a window, seeing... \nThe trainees shuffling into formation like the living dead.  Jordan is still among them. \nEXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nTHE CHIEF You have noticed a ship's bell hanging at the west side of this courtyard.  If, at any time, you feel you cannot continue with your training -- that bell is your salvation.  Strike it three times, and the ordeal is over. \nNervous eyes flick to the bell. \nTHE CHIEF Yes, it is a long walk.  So I'll make it as easy as I can. \nHe turns his back to the class. \nTHE CHIEF Now you don't have to watch me watching you break rank.  Because I know someone here wants to do it. \nCAMERA SEARCHES their faces.  There isn't one trainee here who hasn't thought about it.  Including Jordan. \nTHE CHIEF Now I know what you're thinking... \nSLUTNIK (low) I'm thinkin' we could jump him right now... \nTHE CHIEF \"Can I really take 15 weeks of this bubonic asshole?\"  If you don't know the answer to that question, the answer is \"No, you cannot.\"  And that is another historical fact.  So do it.  Admit you don't have what it takes... admit you are out of your depth -- or we're all heading back to the beach right now. (waiting a beat) Instructors!  Time hack! \nFollowing the Chief's lead, Instructors lift their dive watches. \nTHE CHIEF Six... five... four... three... two... one... HACK! (to class) The time is now 12-hundred.  The sun is shining brightly.  Plenty of daylight left for another phone-pole run... \nGROANS behind him.  The groans give way to the SOUND OF BOOTS breaking rank. \nINT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nBLONDELL'S POV:  Of a lone figure crossing to the bell. \nEXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nQUICK CLOSEUPS of Miller, Slutnik, Wickwire, turning to watch someone cross the grinder.  At least we know who it isn't. \nCLOSE on the Chief as the BELL RINGS THREE TIMES.  He turns around to find... \nStamm at the bell. \nFor the first time, the Chief looks dead-bang at Jordan. Was he expecting her? \nTHE CHIEF Leave your helmet there, Stamm. Back to the barracks. \nStamm drops his helmet and limps away. \nTHE CHIEF The rest of you should remember one thing.  The only easy day was today. Lieutenant Wickwire?  Turning it over to you. \nWICKWIRE Cuh-lass, face right! \nThey march off. \nINT.  MESS HALL - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nDead-ass tired, Jordan slides her tray down the line, piling on food that means nothing more than raw calories. She heads for... \nA table of trainees, one spot open.  Seeing her coming, the guys shift position.  Suddenly the table is full. \nENGLAND Better look elsewhere, O'Neil. \nJordan glares.  None of them meet her eyes.  She wheels around -- and now all eyes are on her, watching her ass walk away.  FEATURE Slutnik, the walking sperm bank. \n", "test2_id": 2050, "test3_input": "DEHAVEN (hitting like a Scud) Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases -- \nINTERRCUTTING: \nC.O. Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses -- \nDEHAVEN -- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this \"G.I. Jane\" thing. \nC.O. -- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution. \nDEHAVEN Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts. \nINT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nThe C.O. double-takes as Jordan enters:  She's sun-burned, wind-burned, sand-burned, chapped and chaffed, bloody and soggy.  Her dive suit leaks onto the floor. \nJORDAN See me, sir? \nC.O. You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant? \nHe tosses her the paper.  Jordan scans the article as DeHaven continues over speakerphone: \nDEHAVEN Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President. (aside to beautician) This my shade?  \"Midnight Mahogany\"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here. \nC.O. Your prerogative, Senator. \nDEHAVEN Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway? \nC.O. Standing right here in my office. \nDEHAVEN Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you? \nJORDAN (catching C.O.'s eyes) Can't complain, ma'am. \nDEHAVEN Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person. \nJORDAN Uh, ma'am. \nDEHAVEN Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base. \nDeafening silence.  We aren't sure who dreads the idea more -- the C.O. or Jordan. \nC.O. Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator. \nDEHAVEN \"Security\"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure? \nC.O. Of course, but there's more -- \nDEHAVEN Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now... \nPhone goes dead.  The C.O. gives Jordan a look one might reserve for a lab technician who inadvertently unleashed Ebola upon the world. \nJORDAN Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not -- \nC.O. \"We'll all have lunch.\"  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS! \nYEOMAN Sir?  Secretary Hayes calling. \nThe C.O.'s headache becomes a migraine. \nJORDAN (backing out) Permission to leave, sir? \nC.O. Permission to evaporate, O'Neil. \nINT.  SENATE BARBER SHOP - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nDeHaven hands the phone to her aide.  He's set up a portable office in the next barber chair. \nDEHAVEN Think I overplayed it? \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is. \nEXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \n150-pound rubber boats (\"Zodiacs\") litter the beach.  The class is breaking down into six-man crews. \nTHE CHIEF Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Get it up! \n", "test3_true": "THE CHIEF Boat Six -- England, O'Neil, McCool, Montgomery, Cortez, and Slutnik. Lieutenant England is your senior officer. \nJordan rolls her eyes:  At least two of the guys in her crew are blue-ribbon misogynists.  Cortez and Slutnik don't like it any better. \nJORDAN Ah, c'mon... \nCORTEZ Motherachrist... \nSLUTNIK Me?  Again? \nTHE CHIEF (looking up) Somebody got a problem with the muster? \nJORDAN Fine by me, sir! \nCORTEZ No problem, sir! \nSLUTNIK Full of joy here, sir! \nExchanging looks across their Zodiac, Jordan and her new crewmates lift the boat overhead. \nTHE CHIEF Boat Seven... \nEXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nWith BATTLE CRIES, 12 boat crews charge into the teeth of the POUNDING SURF.  Some lose their boat to the first wave; others clear the surf and scramble aboard. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO (into bullhorn) First crew to finish gets hot food and warm racks for the night!  Rest of you are digging hide-sites and eating earthworms tonight! \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nBeyond the breakers, the Zodiacs run parallel to shore, crews paddling furiously, racing the wind, the sun, the other crews.  Instructors shadow in power boats, stopwatches running. \nEXT.  BOAT SIX - OCEAN - DAY \nMcCool Don't wanna be pickin' no sandcrabs outta my ass tonight! \nENGLAND So shutup and stroke, McCool! \nSLUTNIK Hoo-yah!  Hoo-yah! \nFlea checks on Jordan.  She paddles hard, really digging in.  Flea grins:  On some level, he has to admire this women. \nJordan catches the grin, gives one back. \nAhead, buoys mark the finish line.  And just when it seems victory is at hand... \nTHWUNK.  Something hits Boat Six.  Suddenly it's losing air.  Jordan torques around to see... \nThe Chief on a nearby boat, speargun in hand. \nTHE CHIEF Your boat just hit razor coral. What do you do now? \nENGLAND Patch and pump!  C'mon!  Whose ass is on the kit? \nMCCOOL I say keep paddlin'!  We're almost -- \nENGLAND Forget it, McCool!  Pri One is to save the boat, not win a race!  So let's get on it! \nThey flail to save their sinking boat.  Boat Five noses past, stealing the lead.  Wickwire tosses Jordan a passing look.  \"Sorry, but...\" \nEXT.  UPPER DUNES - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nUp and down the dunes, crews are digging \"hide-sites\" -- six-man holes that will be their homes tonight.  Cortez and Slutnik are uprooting shrubs, collecting camouflage material. \nCORTEZ Four years I petition to get into this program.  Four years.  Finally get here, and now it's co-ed?  Such bullshit.  Now I'm gettin' hammered just 'cuz she's on our crew. \nSLUTNIK Least you don't have to sleep with her every goddamn night. \nCORTEZ Tellin' you, I'd rather be the last class with balls than the first one with chicks. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  UPPER DUNES - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nJordan and Flea fill sand bags to shore up the walls of their hide-site.  England and McCool shovel back to back. \nMCCOOL Had a grandaddy who wanted to be a Navy man.  Wanted to fire them big guns on a big-ass battleship.  But Navy said to him, \"Oh, no.  You can only do one thing on a battleship.\" \"Well what's that?\" grandaddy said. \"Cook,\" they said.  Now this ain't 100 years ago -- I'm talkin' United States Navy, middla World War II.

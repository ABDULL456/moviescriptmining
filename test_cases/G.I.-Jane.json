{"train": "G.I. JANE \nby \nDavid Twohy \nFIRST DRAFT \nAugust 6, 1995 \nFADE IN: \nINT.  SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nBlinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit in the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES, a 50-year-old civilian.  This is his confirmation hearing. Reading from prepared material: \nHAYES ... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on -- \nDEHAVEN Whoa, whoa, whoa.  \"Land-based maritime specialties.\" Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that... \nAt the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to ponder the ceiling of the hearing room.  Her plaque card reads \"CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE.\" DeHaven is a tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60. In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades -- and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim. \nDEHAVEN Would that be anything like \"typing\"?  \"Restocking the cupboards\"?  That sort of thing, Mr. Hayes? \nCHUCKLES from the packed gallery.  The flag officers go stone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile. \nHAYES Hardly the case, Senator. \nDEHAVEN Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point... \nOn cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members of the dais.  Hayes gets a copy, too.  And it jars him. \nDEHAVEN \"The Lark Report.\" \nHAYES Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether -- \nDEHAVEN (to others on panel) The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens. (to Hayes) You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right? \nHAYES I was one member of the investigating commission. \nDEHAVEN Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was \"pilot error,\" hmm? \nHAYES I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of -- \nDEHAVEN I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes. \nA humorless smile.  She's roasting his nuts over an open fire, and everyone knows it. \nHAYES The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier. \nDEHAVEN That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior. (closing report) In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well. \nINT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nHeading for her office, DeHaven is escorted by a small PRESS RETINUE. \nDEHAVEN ... a full 35 percent of all jobs in the U.S. military are still, to this day, off-limits to women.  And that's simply gotta change. \nPRESS #1 What about those who say women aren't suited for all jobs?  That they're physically weaker... they have less stamina... \nDEHAVEN Sure.  And we're gonna hog the bathroom, too. \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE catches up, pulls her aside. \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE White House boys want a private meeting. \nDEHAVEN I'll act surprised. \nINT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nShoes dumped on her desk, DeHaven changes out knee-high stockings while devoting one ear to... \nWHITE HOUSE #1 ... to reassure you that he has every faith in the ability of Mr. Hayes to guide the Navy into the next century.  The task, as the Administration sees it, is to acknowledge changing realities without losing traditional values. \nA beat.  DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys -- #1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier. \nDEHAVEN 'Zat it?  Ten minutes, nothin' on the table?  Sweetcakes, you best go back to the President and tell him to open up the phone book and start lookin' for his next nominee. \nWhite House #1 looks spanked.  Taking over, #2 pops a briefcase.  An inch-think report appears before DeHaven. \nROYCE (blowing a sigh) I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen. \nJORDAN Which is guy-speak for... \nROYCE (conceding) Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you. \nJORDAN You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know. \nWounded, she gets out. \nROYCE Jordan... \nJORDAN Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much. \nShe punches into a robe and leaves.  Royce considers drowning himself in the tub. \nEXT.  CORONADO BRIDGE - SAN DIEGO - DAY \nJordan drives a top-down Mustang across the sweeping Coronado Bridge, cityscape behind her, naval base ahead. \nA flock of pelicans pace Jordan alongside the bridge. Suddenly two NAVY HELOS BLAST overhead, scattering the pelicans. \nEXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nOn base, Jordan carries a gunnysack across an asphalt courtyard.  The is \"the grinder,\" reminiscent of a gladiator's arena.  She notices at one end... \nA silver ship's bell.  Hung prominently. \nINT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nJORDAN Excuse me, lieutenant.  I was told this is where I check in. \nA DUTY OFFICER looks up to find Jordan across a counter. In no particular hurry, the duty officer makes his way over to check Jordan's orders. \nDUTY OFFICER (looking up) So you're the one. \nHearing, other workers look up.  Among them is a female ensign, KATHY BLONDELL -- no makeup, no nail polish, no concession to her sex.  Throughout, she'll watch Jordan with more than passing interest. \nJORDAN Still don't have my bearings yet. Direct me to the officer's quarters? \nThe duty officer stamps her paperwork, returns it with room assignment and keys. \nDUTY OFFICER You'll proceed directly to the infirmary for eye tests, blood tests, urinalysis, pregnancy test. Uniform issue adjacent.  Then you're to report to the Base Commander. He'd like a word with you. \nJORDAN Fine.  And the officer's quarters? \nDUTY OFFICER C.O.'s office can supply you with directions.  Enjoy your visit, lieutenant. \nIt's a nasty little barb -- one that Jordan decides to let slide.  Jordan turns for the door.  Blondell catches up with a base map. \nBLONDELL B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door. \nJORDAN Thank you, ensign. \nBLONDELL No problem, lieutenant. \nINT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nA soft KNOCKING. \nC.O. Come. \nA YEOMAN opens the door.  Behind him is Jordan. \nYEOMAN Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil reporting, sir. \nFor a beat, COMMANDING OFFICER (C.O.) TURRENTINE takes stock of the female in his doorway, sizing her up like a fighter across the ring.  Then he stubs out a perfectly good cigar, rises with an amiable face, and touches the back of a chair -- stopping just short of pulling it out for her. \nC.O. Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant... \nJORDAN Thank you, sir. \nC.O. Would you care for a beverage?  Tea? \nJORDAN I'm fine, sir. \nC.O. So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you. \nJORDAN Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain. \nTHE CHIEF You may think that you are the brightest, the best, the strongest. I assure you, that is a total delusion on your part.  It is my job to show you just how weak human beings can truly be.  60 percent of you will not finish this course. How do I know?  Because that is an historical fact. \nIt's also intimidating shit. \nTHE CHIEF Poles down. \nThe earth literally shakes as the phone poles hit the damp sand.  Approaching on foot, the Chief loads fresh batteries into his bullhorn.  He does it like a man thumbing rounds into a shotgun. \nTHE CHIEF Now for the bad new:  I always like to get one quitter on the first day. And until I do, the first day does not end.  So look around right now -- go on, do it.  I wonder who it's gonna be... \nHe passes right by Jordan, never meeting her eyes. INSTRUCTOR PYRO steps up.  He's the Chief's bulldog. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Down to BVDs! \nThe guys strip down to boxers.  Jordan settles for boxers and jog bra. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Now face the Pacific... link arms... and take a stroll! \nThe class wades in.  The first wave takes Jordan's breath away:  It's February, and the water is cold.  When they move out of instructors' earshot: \nSTAMM What is it with the damn phone poles?  We sign up for Spec-Recon or GTE? \nWICKWIRE Just trying to thin the herd. That's all they want to do right now. \nSome of the guys are glancing Jordan's way, cashing in on a cheap wet T-shirt contest.  Jordan covers herself instinctively -- and hates the instinct.  Modesty isn't going to get her through this. \nSLUTNIK Man.  Doesn't she know it's rude to point? \nNEWBERRY Wow.  You see that girl? \nWICKWIRE I got eyes, Newberry. \nSLUTNIK One night.  Just one night in my room, she'd forget all about playin' commando. \nENGLAND Tone that shit down, Slutnik.  You heard with they said. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Out of the water! \nThe class breaks for the beach. \nTHE CHIEF Now make like sugar cookies and roll in the sand for me. \nThe trainees hit their bellies and roll.  Indeed, they look like sugar cookies. \nTHE CHIEF Collect those poles, gentlemen. Still a lotta beachfront you haven't seen... \nGroaning, the trainees grab poles.  Jordan's pole, wet slips from their collective grasp... \nAnd bangs Stamm's ankle.  He HOWLS through his teeth. \nENGLAND How bad?  Stamm? \nJORDAN We better get a medic over -- \nSTAMM No, goddamnit.  No. \nINSTRUCTOR Up!  Up!  Up!  Up! \nStamm swallows the pain.  Poles go back on shoulders. Looking like drunk centipedes, the class staggers off down the beach. \nEXT.  MUD PIT - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nWallowing in mud, the class does belly-busters, atomic sit-ups -- and the sadistic reverse push-up, where trainees lie of their backs, place hands under shoulder blades and push their crotches skyward. \nTHE CHIEF Pain is your friend.  You ally.  It will keep you awake in times of emergency... it will tell you when you are seriously injured... it will keep you angry and remind you to finish the job and get the hell home.  But you know the best thing about pain? \nCLASS No, sir! \nTHE CHIEF It lets you know that you aren't dead yet. \nInstructors roam, RASPING ORDERS, kicking students into proper position.  Jordan struggles with the reverses. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Go regulation if you can't do the reverses, O'Neil. \nShe looks around.  A lot of the guys are having trouble with the reverses, not just her. \nJORDAN Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil. \nSLUTNIK Half a night, Lord, just gimme half a night to set her straight... \nJordan tries another table.  This one, too, becomes abruptly full.  As Jordan leaves, HOLD on Miller.  He's a human eclipse -- six-three, 220, the perfect commando physique.  Instructors wish they could clone him. \nMILLER Average woman is 25 percent body fat.  That's one-quarter fat, man. Think about that. \nMCCOOL Nice distribution, though. \nMILLER No way does she makes this program. No way. \nAfter wandering the mess hall like a homeless person, Jordan finds refuge at a table with female mess stewards. They look at her with blank faces.  No understanding.  No compassion. \nEXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nJordan walks in a bathrobe, toweling her hair dry.  She fishes for keys at her door. \nVOICE It's not so much that they hate you... \nJordan looks.  Someone is sitting on an outdoor table, smoking.  He leans into the light so she can see his face. It's Wickwire, the mid-30s lieutenant who doubles as class officer.  He's dangerously handsome. \nWICKWIRE They're more afraid of you. \nJORDAN Well, now I feel so much better. \nWICKWIRE It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway. \nJORDAN Whose orders were those? \nWICKWIRE It was made clear. (getting up) Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half. \nJORDAN And how do you know that? \nWICKWIRE Made it to Week 10 last time. \nJORDAN I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age. \nWICKWIRE You're kind of a surprise yourself. \nA faint grin from Wickwire before he shadows back across the courtyard that separates the two B.O.Q. buildings. Back across no-man's land. \nINT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nTwo beds.  Matching lockers.  A desk, a chair, a mirror. All overwhelmingly dull. \nJordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory of her body.  Both sides of her neck are bruised from the phone-pole run.  Her back and thighs are sand-burned. Mirror cuts abound.  She's already a mess. \nJordan uncaps some cologne.  It's a vestige of her old life she's not going to surrender.  She sniffs.  Savors. Dabs.  Looks back in the mirror... \nAnd breaks out laughing.  It's like dropping a rose in a cesspool. \nEXT.  SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - CORONADO - DAY \nA PHOTOGRAPHER stands near a car parked just outside the base.  He's peering through a 600mm lens. \nPHOTOGRAPHER'S POV:  FOCUSING through cyclone fencing... PANNING past the sand dunes... and finding green-clad trainees gathered at an obstacle course. \nEXT.  OBSTACLE COURSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nAn explosion of sand:  England and Wickwire belly-flop into a sand pit and speed-crawl under barbed wire.  Clear, they gain their feet and blitz toward... \nThe rolling logs.  They balance-beam their way to... \nThe rope climb.  Racing to the top, they reach a platform and fling themselves down onto... \nThe high poles.  They land awkwardly, losing their wind and their grip, tumbling into the sand pit below before... \nRacing for the finish.  The Chief thumbs a stopwatch. \nTHE CHIEF England, 88 seconds.  You're good to go for the slide-for-life. Wickwire, roll back till you get south of 90. \nWICKWIRE Fuck.  Yes sir. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Who'd you kiss to get back in here, anyway? \nWickwire dusts off and starts back for... \nThe starting line.  Stepping up next is Cortez, the human fighting cock.  Jordan lines up beside him and psyches up for the first obstacle -- and eight-foot sheer wall. \nINSTRUCTOR JOHNS Hang on, here... \nThe outdoor table.  No visitors tonight. \nINT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nJordan pushes inside -- and stops when she sees the little two-step platform.  That awful crutch.  Someone has put it beside her bed. \nJordan wheels around to check... \nEXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nThe men' building.  Slutnik and a few others loiter on a balcony, mirroring her stare. \nEXT.  CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nHastily dressed, Jordan marches across the base.  Her march turns into an angry run as she cuts through parking lots... jumps hedges... and finally reaches... \nEXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nAn on-base bungalow.  Jordan bangs on the front door until the C.O.'S scowling face appears. \nJORDAN Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way. \nC.O. Didn't take long. \nHe waves her inside. \nINT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nC.O. All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning. (waits) A name? \nJORDAN It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here. \nC.O. (jolted) Oh, really. \nJORDAN It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met. \nC.O. Because I was civil, now you're complaining. \nJORDAN I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- \"Yeah, she made it, but...\"  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base? \nC.O. Did you just have a brain-fart? \nJORDAN Pardon? \nC.O. Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home. \nJORDAN I think you've resented me from the start, sir. \nNow, finally, her opponent steps into the ring.  And he's a bare-knuckle brawler. \nC.O. (building) What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears. (drawing close) But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT? \nJORDAN No, sir. \nC.O. No, sir, WHAT? \nJORDAN The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench. \nA dangerous beat -- before the C.O. disengages. \nC.O. Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language. (a beat) So one standard.  Is that what you're after? \nJORDAN Same rules for everyone, sir. \nC.O. Straight up? \nJORDAN Across the board, sir. \nC.O. And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular. \nJORDAN Wouldn't dream of it, sir. \nA deciding beat. \nC.O. Then good night. \nJORDAN So I'll get a fair shot? \nC.O. You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get. \nDEHAVEN (hitting like a Scud) Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases -- \nINTERRCUTTING: \nC.O. Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses -- \nDEHAVEN -- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this \"G.I. Jane\" thing. \nC.O. -- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution. \nDEHAVEN Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts. \nINT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nThe C.O. double-takes as Jordan enters:  She's sun-burned, wind-burned, sand-burned, chapped and chaffed, bloody and soggy.  Her dive suit leaks onto the floor. \nJORDAN See me, sir? \nC.O. You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant? \nHe tosses her the paper.  Jordan scans the article as DeHaven continues over speakerphone: \nDEHAVEN Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President. (aside to beautician) This my shade?  \"Midnight Mahogany\"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here. \nC.O. Your prerogative, Senator. \nDEHAVEN Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway? \nC.O. Standing right here in my office. \nDEHAVEN Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you? \nJORDAN (catching C.O.'s eyes) Can't complain, ma'am. \nDEHAVEN Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person. \nJORDAN Uh, ma'am. \nDEHAVEN Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base. \nDeafening silence.  We aren't sure who dreads the idea more -- the C.O. or Jordan. \nC.O. Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator. \nDEHAVEN \"Security\"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure? \nC.O. Of course, but there's more -- \nDEHAVEN Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now... \nPhone goes dead.  The C.O. gives Jordan a look one might reserve for a lab technician who inadvertently unleashed Ebola upon the world. \nJORDAN Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not -- \nC.O. \"We'll all have lunch.\"  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS! \nYEOMAN Sir?  Secretary Hayes calling. \nThe C.O.'s headache becomes a migraine. \nJORDAN (backing out) Permission to leave, sir? \nC.O. Permission to evaporate, O'Neil. \nINT.  SENATE BARBER SHOP - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nDeHaven hands the phone to her aide.  He's set up a portable office in the next barber chair. \nDEHAVEN Think I overplayed it? \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is. \nEXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \n150-pound rubber boats (\"Zodiacs\") litter the beach.  The class is breaking down into six-man crews. \nTHE CHIEF Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Get it up! \nENGLAND He talked too much? \nMCCOOL \"Negroes can't see at night.  Bad night vision.\" \nJORDAN You're kiddin' me. \nJordan jumps in the hole, ready to take over shoveling. \nMCCOOL See, you just the new nigger on the block, O'Neil.  That's all.  And maybe you moved in too early. \nHe climbs out.  HOLD on Jordan, looking off down the dunes, seeing the other crews covering up and going underground for the night.  How the hell did she wind up here?  So far from home? \nEXT.  SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - DAY \nA Jeep speeds along the public highway, carrying the C.O. back to base.  When the Jeep tops a rise: \nC.O. What in God's name... \nAhead, a half-dozen news crews are camped on the shoulder. All cameras are trained on the base. \nINT.  BEDROOM - GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCAMERA FINDS Navy dress blues laid out on a bed... topcoat draped on a chair-back... CNN on a television. \nCNN COMMENTATOR (TV) ... is denying that it is considering changing its long-held policy of exclusion -- but it isn't denying the presence of at least one female in a heretofore all-male program.  Dubbed \"G.I. Jane\" by the media, this woman is now undergoing commando training at the Special Warfare Command Center in San Diego... \nHalf-shaven, Royce leans out of the bathroom in time to catch... \nFootage from Coronado:  A woman in Navy greens is on a beach run, loaded down with backpack and M-16.  The NEWS FOOTAGE ZOOMS IN, FREEZE FRAMES with the indelible image that will be used over and over in coming weeks:  Woman cradling rifle.  Madonna for the 21st century. \nROYCE Goddamn.  My poster girl. \nCNN COMMENTATOR (TV) Senator DeHaven's office still has not released the identity of the woman, but DeHaven is confirming that \"G.I. Jane\" has outlasted many of her male counter-parts in the program, said to be one of the most grueling anywhere.  Joining us now on \"Washington Tonight\" for the feminist perspective is Gloria Allred, live from -- \nRoyce snaps it off.  He can't take anymore. \nINT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT \nBeneath the coffered ceiling of a great Beau-Art hall, one of Washington's power-tribes is celebrating.  We find gowned women, tuxedoed men, gold-braided naval officers, a SWING BAND, and... \nSecretary Hayes, newly confirmed.  He beams as he dances with his wife.  Compliments and friendly barbs come from all directions: \nCOMPLIMENTS (O.S.) Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.  Say hello to the President for me... Maybe now you can change that carpet in your office, Teddy... So what was the deal you made with DeHaven?  Or was it the Devil?  Always get them confused... \nHAYES Didn't you hear?  Effective immediately, all navy vessels can no longer be referred to as \"she.\" \nBRAYS of laughter. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT \nRoyce, EXCUSING his way through the crowd, fixating on the bar, leading his DIAL-A-DATE winner by the hand. Conversations drift into earshot: \nVOICE #1 ... women are child-bearers.  Life- givers.  Now we're going to make them killers? \nVOICE #2 ... just don't have the upper-body strength... \nVOICE #3 How strong do you need to be to launch a rocket?  To push a button or pull a trigger? \nRoyce can't get away from it. \nDIAL-A-DATE Are we going to dance? \nROYCE Not right now. \nJust yards from the bar, a Pentagon E-RINGER snags Royce's elbow. \nE-RINGER Commander Royce.  How's life across the river? \nROYCE Little slow, sir.  When's the Pentagon going to send me a good crisis? \nE-RINGER I'll check my out-basket in the morning.  Say, do you know... \nThe E-Ringer turns to make introductions -- but finds his CIRCLE OF FRIENDS embroiled in the topic du jour: \nCIRCLE #1 ... but men have trained as athletes for 5,000 years.  Women have been at it for, what, couple of decades?  Do we really know the limits of their strength? \nCIRCLE #2 Or their endurance?  You know, 30 years ago, women marathoners were 90 minutes off the pace of the men. Now, the women's time is probably only 20 minutes off. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nJordan resurfaces.  Treading water, she scans for... \nSeafox.  It makes a hard turn in the water and starts back.  The recovery rig -- a big flexible loop -- is lowered into position. \nStill hauling ass, Seafox picks up the trainees in reverse order -- England, Slutnik, Cortez.  They each stab an arm through the passing loop... \nEXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY \n... and vault back aboard, slick as hell. \nCORTEZ Hoo-yah!  Better'n sex in a car crash! \nBut now they're bearing down fast on... \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nJordan.  She braces as best she can.  As SEAFOX THUNDERS past, she stabs for the loop... \nAnd snags it with her hand.  But only her hand. \nHanging on grimly, Jordan drags face down in torrential water.  Her mouth gropes for clean air but can't find it. If she doesn't let go soon, she'll drown. \nEXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY \nAt the stern, the Chief spots Jordan bobbing up in the boat's wake. \nTHE CHIEF (to pilot) Next recovery!  Keep goin', keep goin'! \nEXT.  OCEAN - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nCOUGHING up water, Jordan watches Seafox speed on toward McCool and Flea.  They make textbook recoveries.  She's the only one who couldn't cut it. \nINT.  WOMEN'S SHOWERS - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nHead hung, Jordan showers alone. \nTHE CHIEF (O.S.) You know, the Israelis... \nJordan recoils.  Christ, how long has he been there?  Just standing in the doorway? \nTHE CHIEF ... they tried women in the 1967 War.  Female soldiers. \nWith forced calm, Jordan squeaks off the water and finds a towel. \nJORDAN Permission to get dressed, sir? \nTHE CHIEF It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore. \nJORDAN (moving closer) Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for? \nTHE CHIEF For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia. \nJORDAN I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft. \nTHE CHIEF Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant? \nShe can't say yes.  She wants to but can't. \nTHE CHIEF Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact. \nJORDAN It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead. \nShe shoulders past.  The Chief gives her a few steps before dropping his bomb: \nTHE CHIEF England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant. \nJORDAN (off-balance) McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s. \nTHE CHIEF You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer. (passing her on his way out) Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders. \nINT.  ARTILLERY RANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nTrainees are getting familiar with M-60 machine guns, firing SHORT BURST at downfield targets. \nCORTEZ (pissed) No operational experience, and now she's callin' the shots? Unbelievable. \nSLUTNIK Suppose she'll wanna eat with us now... \nJORDAN So why are you telling me this? \nROYCE Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you. \nJORDAN You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too. \nROYCE I'm only trying to warn you in case -- \nJORDAN Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay? \nROYCE That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't... \nJORDAN Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce. \nROYCE Jordan.  You watch your ass. \nJORDAN Sure.  I'll join the crowd. \nEXT.  AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nA HELO WARMS UP on its pad. \nCrew Six approaches, garbed in black wetsuits, loaded down with weapons and rucksacks.  Jordan is at the lead. \nINT.  HELO - NIGHT \nThe helo is airborne.  Sitting on rucksacks, trainees slather their faces with green camouflage paint.  Over the HOWLING ROTORS: \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Infiltrate... establish your hide- site... record any movement of troops, vehicles, patrols -- any activity inside your scan.  If you are compromised, you have two options!  Newberry! \nNewberry is the new sixth man.  He's young enough to still have a hyperactive Adam's apple. \nNEWBERRY Evasive maneuvers or radio for emergency extraction, sir! \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO If you are extracting, be damn sure to follow procedures you have learned in your classroom training! A helo cannot extract you from a wooded area!  You must bring it down in a clearing!  What's the minimum clearance for an MH-60 Black Hawk, McCool? \nMCCOOL 32 feet, six inches, sir! \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO You will be penalized for early extraction, but you will be penalized more for capture -- trust me, far more!  Survival!  Evasion! Rescue!  Evacuation!  Welcome to S.E.R.E.! \nEXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT \nThe helo swoops low over the water, moon silhouetting. Black figures helo-cast into the ocean. \nINT.  HELO - NIGHT \nLast out, Jordan is poised to follow when... \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Lieutenant!  Don't back down! \nJordan looks back.  \"What the hell does that mean?\" Offering no elaboration, Pyro signals \"GO!\"  Jordan springs clear... \nEXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT \n... and knifes into black water. \nThe HELO PATTERS away. \nAn inky stillness overtakes the world. \nJordan activates a red-light beacon, sweeps it around, revealing her position to... \nHer crew.  Five black faces regroup around her. \nSLUTNIK Feel right at home, McCool? \nThey secure weapons atop their waterproof rucksacks. Jordan checks a heat-bearing compass. \nJORDAN (nodding direction) South-southeast.  And I don't want to hear another word till we're underground. \nPushing rucksacks ahead of them, they start swimming towards... \nA moonlit shoreline.  Half-mile ahead. \nEXT.  ROCKY SHORELINE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT \nJordan's crew reaches shallow water.  They deflate their vests and rucksacks.  Jordan trades her face mask for night-vision goggles. \nNIGHT-VISION POV:  Sweeping the rocks.  Nothing at first. Then two \"hostiles\" appear, patrolling the rocks. \nMcCool takes a second look. \nSCOPE POV:  Of the women drawing closer... closer... and finally looking dead-bang at us.  She does an about-face and walks away.  Quickly. \nMCCOOL Shit.  Think we're had. \nCORTEZ Smoke her. \nMCCOOL I ain't gonna shoot her. \nCORTEZ Only blanks.  Lemme do it. \nMCCOOL (pushing him away) Hey.  Ain't your call, man. \nHe looks to Jordan. \nJORDAN Pri One is to protect the mission. If she represents a real threat, we have to do it. \nPleased, Cortez slips his rifle under a roof panel. \nJORDAN (to McCool) But did she see us?  Do you know for a fact that we are compromised? \nMcCool doesn't.  Not for sure. \nJORDAN If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that? \nMCCOOL (a beat) Mighta been civilian. \nNEWBERRY They got regular peeps on this island, don't they? \nEXT.  ROAD - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY \nThe asphalt road shimmers with midday heat.  Suddenly a TROOP CARRIER ROARS over a rise. \nINT.  HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY \nSCOPE POV:  Of the troop carrier braking hard.  \"Hostiles\" spill out the rear -- and fan out all around us. \nCORTEZ (at scope) Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it! \nMCCOOL Fuck me. \nFLEA What's the word, el-tee?  We're about one minute from a major take- down here. \nHOLD on Jordan, heart skipping.  Did she really make the wrong call? \nJORDAN All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready? \nSLUTNIK Sure.  Now she wants to shoot. \nJORDAN MOVE! \nEXT.  SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY \nThey come out of the hide-site like atomic locusts, splintering into three groups and laying down SUPPRESSIVE FIRE as they blitz for... \nThe woodlands. \n\"Hostiles\" FIRE and pursue. \nFlea is running flat out when the ground vanishes beneath him.  He goes down like a doped race horse.  Suddenly exposed, another crew scrambles into daylight:  Flea ran right over their hide-site. \nSlutnik yanks Flea out, gets him back on his feet. \nEXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY \nBreathing like asthmatics, Jordan's crew regroups at the link-up site just inside the woods.  Flea comes in hobbling.  Badly. \nSLUTNIK This ain't workin' right! \nMCCOOL What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil? \nSLUTNIK This ain't even workin' wrong! \nA beat as Jordan deliberates.  She doesn't want to go out like this. \nFLEA Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things. \nJORDAN Fuck. (snatching the radio) Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix... \nAs \"hostiles\" pull Flea out of the pen. \nINT.  BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - NIGHT \nA BANGING wakes Jordan.  Are they coming for her?  But FOOTSTEPS LEAVE.  A GROAN from the adjacent box. \nJORDAN Who is it? \nWICKWIRE (O.S.) (a beat) You know, I had an apartment about this size once. \nJORDAN Wick.  They got your crew, too? \nWICKWIRE (O.S.) Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit. \nA beat. \nJORDAN You really came back for more?  Of this? \nWICKWIRE (O.S.) When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell... \nJORDAN If you got a good one, Wick... \nAnything to get her mind off this box.  Out of this box. Now INTERCUT Jordan and Wickwire, lying like fraternal twins in their wombs of steel: \nWICKWIRE One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts. \nJORDAN They had to kill 'em? \nWICKWIRE Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted. \nJORDAN That's a good story. \nWICKWIRE So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything. \nJORDAN He was married? \nWICKWIRE At first. \nJORDAN You got anybody, Wick? \nWICKWIRE Not me.  You? \nIt hurts to think about it.  The Potomac.  The gunkhole harbor.  Royce. \nWICKWIRE O'Neil? \nJORDAN How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part? \nWICKWIRE (a beat) Last time I didn't. \nJORDAN (jarred) Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me... \nEXT.  NEWSSTAND - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY \nRoyce stops for a newspaper.  As he pays, something else catches his eye.  He picks up... \nA \"People\" magazine.  The grainy image of \"G.I. Jane\" fills the cover.  A photo inset, much clearer, shows a beaming DeHaven.  \"BEHIND EVERY GREAT WOMAN...\" \nROYCE (shaking head) Suitable for framing... \nINT.  CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY \nROYCE Got time for a brain-pick? \nReading as he walks, a former CIA spook looks up to find Royce in lockstep.  It surprises him:  Not many people here talk to him -- unless they're in trouble.  THE SPOOK is physically unremarkable except for a face that would be right at home on Easter Island:  This is a man who's seen most of the world's ills -- and forgotten none. \nTHE SPOOK Subject? \nROYCE O'Neil, Jordan. \nTHE SPOOK Thought you two were file-closed. \nROYCE You knew about us? \nTHE SPOOK Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew. \nINT.  SITUATION ROOM - N.I.C. - DAY \nRoyce and the Spook enter.  The vault-like door closes emphatically.  Ensuring their privacy: \nTHE CHIEF You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now. \nJORDAN Should I be afraid? \nTHE CHIEF Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh? \nIt makes Jordan think -- and yes, it makes her afraid. Continuing the psychological strip-search: \nTHE CHIEF Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil? \nJORDAN Wasn't deemed a threat. \nTHE CHIEF She led us right to you.  That's no threat? \nJordan rubs her head.  So long ago.  How did the call come down? \nTHE CHIEF Would you have shot if it was a man? \nJORDAN No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on -- \nTHE CHIEF The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women -- \nJORDAN That's not right. \nTHE CHIEF That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you? \nJORDAN I think you're the liar. \nTHE CHIEF I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew -- \nJORDAN We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position. \nTHE CHIEF You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil? \nShe stares a beat, knowing it's a loaded question. \nTHE CHIEF Do you? \nJORDAN No. \nTHE CHIEF I'm so glad we agree. \nWith stunning ferocity, he grabs her by the neck, pushes her out the door... \nEXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY \n... and throws her onto a table. \nIn the pens, all faces turn to watch.  Even instructors stop what they're doing as... \nThe Chief pushes Jordan's head down and jams up behind her. \nTHE CHIEF Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that? \nJORDAN Sure.  Just like your men do. \nTHE CHIEF I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect. \nHe flips her over, rips off her belt, starts tearing open her pants. \nJORDAN Should I practice bleeding, too, sir?  Would that make me a better soldier? \nHe covers her mouth -- her whole face -- with one hand. \nTHE CHIEF (to the men) Any of you can stop this!  Just give me the location of one more hide- site, and it ends right here! \nIn the pen: \nSLUTNIK (wide-eyed) Someone's trippin' out here... \nThe Chief jerks Jordan up, whirls her around like a dead dance partner, slams her face-first into the pen to give the guys a good look at what's happening to that pretty face. \nTHE CHIEF Three crews are still on this island somewhere.  Who knows where? \nThe men trade itchy looks.  Some do know. \nJORDAN Don't do it, don't do it... \nThe Chief throws her down like garbage. \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.) Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws. \nThe phone suddenly weights a ton, DeHaven dumps it on the seat beside her.  HOLD on her disbelieving face. \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.) You there?  Senator? \nINT.  CORRIDOR - PENTAGON - DAY \nHand-carrying a report, Flag Officer #1 hurries down a corridor, pushes through a door.  HOLD on the door marker: \"Secretary of the Navy.\" \nINT.  SECNAV OFFICE - PENTAGON - DAY \nHAYES Without telling us they do this? With absolutely no lead time? \nAt his desk, Hayes scans the report with a deepening frown. \nFLAG OFFICER #1 (to Hayes) Mr. Secretary, if this bill passes... \nFLAG OFFICER #2 Forget our three-year plan.  They're rushing the cadence.  We'll be forced to reorganize the Navy from top to bottom -- overnight. \nHAYES What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder? \nFLAG OFFICER #1 I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly. \nHAYES \"G.I. Jane.\"  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh? \nThe flags squirm.  Shaking his head, Hayes moves to a window that offers a stunning view of Arlington National Cemetery. \nHAYES 20 years in the Pentagon, I finally rate an office with a window -- and it looks out over the world's largest graveyard.  Think it's a sign? \nEXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nThe bell.  It reflects the moon.  TILT DOWN to reveal a new batch of helmets -- the casualties of S.E.R.E.  A graveyard of its own. \nEXT.  THE EXCHANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nJordan exits with purchases.  Her face is still bruised from S.E.R.E.  With a minute to kill, she peruses a bulletin board casually.  But a RAISED VOICE leads her eyes to... \nWickwire.  At a phone kiosk, he hangs up emphatically.  He looks flustered when he spots Jordan. \nJORDAN Sorry, didn't mean to -- \nWICKWIRE That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why. \nJORDAN First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire. \nWICKWIRE Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you? \nJORDAN (touching bruises) I can't go out.  Not like this. \nWICKWIRE I think you look beautiful. \nJORDAN Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides... \nCatching up, Blondell exits the exchange. \nBLONDELL Sorry.  Forgot I needed oregano and... \nShe sees Wickwire.  An awkward beat for them all. \nJORDAN Do you, uh, know... \nWICKWIRE Sure, sure. \nJORDAN We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special. \nWICKWIRE Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask. \nJordan and Blondell head for the parking lot.  HOLD on Wickwire, looking after them.  Thinking it through. \nINT.  CLASSROOM - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nCharts are being passed around the room.  Every trainee takes one, including Jordan. \nINSTRUCTOR JOHNS ... underwater detonation devices employ mechanical timers, and as such, they are subject to variances due to water temperature.  That's why when clearing mines, we always use two timers.  The charts now being passed out contain calculations you must memorize before... \nA MILITARY COP fills the classroom doorway.  Frowning, Johns joins the cop for a private discussion. \nINSTRUCTOR JOHNS O'Neil? \nShe passes them robotically.  Flea realizes where she's going. \nFLEA Oh, no... no, no, no, no... \nThey lurch after her, grabbing her, stepping in her way. \nTHE CHIEF Stand fast! \nMcCool and Flea jerk to a stop:  The Chief has emerged from the instructor's office.  Helpless, they watch as... \nJordan mounts the stairs to the bell... takes up the baton... and HITS THE BELL like a tyko drummer. \nRING ONE:  On the pained faces of her crewmates. \nRING TWO:  On the Chief.  Taking no joy in it.  Just accepting it as inevitable. \nEXT.  THE QUARTERDECK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nRING THREE:  On Wickwire as he walks across the base.  His regrets are obvious. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  UPRIVER - THE POTOMAC - DAY \nThe ice floes are gone.  The river banks are budding green.  Soon CAMERA FINDS a power boat making its way upriver.  A lone figure sits on the prow. \nEXT.  POWER BOAT - DAY \nIt's Jordan.  Dressed in civvies, gunnysack between her legs, she's back in Virginia with nothing more than what she left with.  Around a river bend appears... \nThe gunkhole harbor.  Home. \nEXT.  GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - DAY \nThe boat docks.  Jordan springs clear, waves a worn-out thanks, starts up the dock.  But now she comes to a stop, seeing... \nRoyce.  Stepping out of the house. \nEXTREMELY WIDE:  River shimmering behind them, they meet on the dock.  A charged stand-off:  Where do they pick up? Can they pick up?  Then Jordan drops her gunnysack and steps into his wide-spread arms.  Royce wraps her up as if to never let go. \nFor the first time in this whole ordeal, Jordan begins crying, sobbing uncontrollably. \nROYCE (in her ear) I want to kill them... I want to kill the guys who made you cry like this... \nINT.  COVERED PORCH - JORDAN'S HOUSE - SUNSET \nAn hour later.  Sharing a quiet moment, Jordan and Royce cradle tea mugs while sitting on the rear porch that overlooks the Potomac and a fiery sunset. \nJORDAN All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay. \nROYCE And this class officer... \"Wickwire.\"  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for... \nJORDAN Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like... (a beat) Did I say he was class officer? \nROYCE Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who? \nJORDAN No shortage of suspects. \nROYCE The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.? \nShe looks at him sidelong. \nJORDAN Royce.  Tell me you didn't keep a file on me. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAY \nCLOSE on multiple files being pulled out of a briefcase. One contains clippings -- \"G.I. Jane\" photos, editorials, political cartoons.  Another holds records of Coronado personnel -- Jordan's crewmates, instructors, the base brass. \nROYCE Somebody was yankin' your stings, Jordan -- maybe from 3,000 miles away.  I wanted to know who.  I still do. \nShe shakes her head, resisting. \nROYCE C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me. \nJORDAN It's done with, Royce.  Let it go. \nROYCE Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back? \nDEHAVEN Just hold the goddamn clock, Walter. \nNot happy about it, the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove, grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions. He enters the chamber... \nINT.  SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \n... and moves behind the rostrum.  Holding the broom by the bristles, the doorkeeper stands on tip-toes... \nAnd uses the broom handle to turn back the Senate clock by three minutes. \nSenators GROAN.  It's an old trick played by senior members -- and they all hate it when it happens to them. \nINT.  CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nDEHAVEN I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team. \nJORDAN You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too? \nDEHAVEN I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable. \nJORDAN I'm sure it is. \nDEHAVEN You'll think about my offer? \nJORDAN You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him. \nDEHAVEN Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige. (dangerously low) Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime. \nDOORKEEPER (distraught) Madam Senator, please... \nDEHAVEN I'll call you in a few days. \nShe flashes a winning smile and turns away.  As the chamber doors start to close behind her: \nJORDAN So I wonder what the President would think. \nThe last image we have of DeHaven is her whirling back, startled.  The DOORS BOOM CLOSED in her face. \nEXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nThrough a window, we see the C.O. with a phone pressed to his ear.  He stands at attention even though wearing a bathrobe.  Half-audible through the glass: \nC.O. Yes sir.  No, I'm not saying it would be impossible, sir, just... Yes sir.  No sir.  Yes sir.  I can appreciate that, sir.  Good night, sir. \nINT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT \nThe C.O. hangs up and looks to Jordan, heretofore unseen. She waits anxiously. \nC.O. Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'. \nJORDAN Sir?  What did he say? \nC.O. Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell. \nEXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nSTART on the helmet graveyard.  Hands enter FRAME to reclaim one helmet in particular.  TILT UP on Jordan, back in the grinder, back in Navy greens. \nThe Spec-Recon class is here.  Crewmates gawk like stone idiots as Jordan takes her old place in the line-up. \nC.O. (to class) One of you here understands better than anyone what this is all about. Someone who has engaged in conduct unbecoming.  Someone who knows, I would hope, what he must now do. \nCLOSE on Wickwire.  Feeling the heat.  Wondering if they really know who it is.  Now the C.O. parks himself right in Wickwire's face. \nC.O. And unless that someone takes the honorable way out in the next 10 seconds -- I will make certain he faces action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. \nWickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell.  He slows when reaching Jordan, considering an apology he knows would be inadequate. \nJORDAN Just walk away and never stop. \nHe does.  As Wickwire RINGS OUT: \nC.O. It seems we have an opening for class officer.  Any nominations? \nEyes swing to Jordan.  Way ahead of them: \nC.O. All those in favor? \nA CHORUS OF AYES.  Jordan puddles up. \nPILOT Holy... LET'S GYRATE! \nAs the pilot wrestles controls, the co-pilot rigs for auto-gyration.  But the bank they started is working against them:  The helo is coming down badly, circling like a huge steel feather. \nBraced, the Chief looks out the side door -- and sees ocean rushing up at him.  Fast. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nMCCOOL What the shit is... \nJordan whirls.  She's just in time to witness... \nThe helo hitting the water.  In seconds it's gone. \nA stunned beat.  We never knew the ocean could be this quiet.  When the anesthetic of shock wears off: \nSLUTNIK You don't suppose this is just part of... \nJORDAN FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for? \nCortez torques his wrench hard:  CO2 flows into the ILB, inflating it.  The crew scrambles aboard.  Jordan digs like a dog to find a radio. \nJORDAN Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  We have a downed helo 12 miles west- south west of base with three aboard.  Repeat, we have a downed helo with three aboard... \nSlutnik yanks a starter cord:  Their outboard MOTOR ROARS to life.  The boat does a donut in the water and blasts away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nThe ILB powers over swells.  Flea is perched on the bow, nose to the wind like a hunting dog. \nFLEA CUT IT!  CUT IT HERE! \nSlutnik motors down. \nFLEA Close as I can get, el-tee! \nJORDAN Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO! \nThey grab masks and mini-tanks and dive in like dolphins. Jordan snaps up the radio. \nJORDAN Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  What is your E.T.A. on that rescue helo? Over. \nBASE (V.O.) Crew Leader, we have a Medevac rerouting from Long Beach, but no other helos prepped at this time. Seafox One and Two are launching now.  Over. \nA beat. \nJORDAN Base, don't think you copied me.  We are 12 miles out.  Seafox tops out at 30 knots, which makes it a no- show for 18 minutes.  Over. \nBASE (V.O.) You copied right, Crew Leader. We're looking for options ourselves. \nSLUTNIK Maybe we should call the Coast Guard. \nJORDAN Shut your hole, Slutnik. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nMcCool surfaces. \nMCCOOL Visibility drops dead at 40 feet. If they're deeper than that... \nThe others surface and swim in. \nCORTEZ Nobody's comin' outta that crash, el-tee.  Nobody. \nA grim beat -- and then A CRACKLE on the radio.  With a voice seemingly from the far side of the moon: \nTHE CHIEF (V.O.) Base, this is Basher One.  I've got a small problem here.  Do you copy? \nJaws drop. \nJORDAN (into radio) Basher One, this is O'Neil.  We are barely reading you.  What is your situation? \nEXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY \n50 feet down, the helo lies canted on a reef shelf. \nJORDAN So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours? \nMCCOOL Maybe half.  Not even. \nJORDAN Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead. \nCORTEZ What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles? \nMCCOOL (grabbing her) O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you? \nJORDAN So I guess we get one shot at it. \nINT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY \nSwimming in his own blood, the Chief starts to fade away, losing consciousness.  But then, through the cockpit windscreen... \nA hazy orb of light above him.  The orb grows and grows until it resolves into a flare carried by his would-be savior.  Jordan. \nTHE CHIEF Why'd it have to be her... \nEXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY \nReaching the downed Helo, McCool and Cortez wedge their oars under the fuselage and leverage hard until... \nAn opening appears. \nJordan and Flea swim into the breach... \nINT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY \n... and surface inside the wreckage. \nJORDAN Chief, sir... still with me? \nCHIEF (unbuckling co-pilot) Take him first.  Once he's clear, come back with -- \nJORDAN Sir, let me suggest you stop giving orders and start doing exactly what I say, because that's the only way we're all getting out of here.  Now how's your vest check out?  Still good? \nEXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY \nMcCool's air craps out.  He abandons his oar and swims for the surface.  That leaves only... \nCortez, struggling mightily to keep the escape route open. He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it scares the bejeezus out of him. \nINT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY \nJORDAN Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed him air.  Chief, sir, you and I are gonna take the express elevator outta here.  Remember to let your air out.  Ready? \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nTwin transports -- Seafox One and Two -- pound across the water.  Instructors sweep binoculars, trying to spot... \nThe ILB.  Newberry POPS A FLARE skyward as Slutnik DOWNLOADS INFO over the radio. \nEXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY \nCortez's air goes dead.  He gives it three more seconds, eyes riveted on the underside of the helo, knowing they have to come out... right... fucking... absolutely... \nNOW:  Jordan appears with the Chief.  Flea is at their heels with the co-pilot. \nCortez drops his oar as if it were radioactive and swims for the sky. \nThe HELO BOOMS back down onto the reef. \nJordan yanks the cord on the Chief's vest.  It inflates instantly.  One arm raised, Jordan streaks for the surface... \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \n... and \"Supermans\" into daylight with the Chief.  They covered 50 feet in four seconds. \nDoing a 360, Jordan spots... \nSeafox One coming their way. \nJordan waves like a shipwreck victim. \nNot slowing, Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place: They're wasting no time on the pick-up. \nRemembering the last time she tried this, Jordan gets a death-grip on the Chief's vest. \n", "test1_input": "INTERCUTTING: \nROYCE Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out. \nJORDAN (an inspired beat) Unless you Whiskey Run. \nROYCE Blank faces here, O'Neil. \nJORDAN Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters. \nA dubious beat. \nROYCE You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil? \nJORDAN Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not? \nSilence on the radio:  They're discussing her scenario privately.  During, Jordan's kayak reaches the junction of the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers.  On the far bank lies... \nNaval Intel Center (N.I.C.), bristling with communication antennae. \nJordan stares at the complex, waiting for a response. \nROYCE All right, sending the recommendation across the river. Royce out. \nThe phone goes dead. \nJORDAN No, thank you, sir. \nEXT.  SECURITY STATION - N.I.C. - DAY \nBundled in topcoat and scarves, military and civilian employees transit a security station on their way inside. Presently Jordan appears -- wearing a wetsuit and balancing a collapsed kayak on her head.  She flashes a photo-badge and double-times inside. \nINT.  CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY \nJordan exits a locker room.  Smoothing out her Khaki uniform, she heads down a broad corridor with cipher-lock doors.  Falling in step: \nROYCE That was good headwork, lieutenant. \nJORDAN Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon? \nROYCE (scoffing) Probably hear back from CNN first. \nJORDAN Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines. \nROYCE Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle. \nNow they reach... \nINT.  BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY \nA circular chamber.  Dominating the ground floor is the bullpen, a hive of cubicles an computer stations.  On the second floor are executive offices, ringing the bullpen. \nROYCE By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here? \nJORDAN (with a look) Is this my glory, sir? \nOn the upper walkway, a frazzled N.I.C. SECRETARY appears.  She spots Royce and Jordan below. \nN.I.C. SECRETARY Excuse me, but I have Senator DeHaven on the line for you. \nROYCE Jesus God, what now? \nHe bounds up the stairs toward his office. \nN.I.C. SECRETARY I'm sorry, sir no -- she asked to speak with Lieutenant O'Neil. \nRoyce turns back and gives Jordan a hall-of-fame look. \"Oh, really?\" \nINT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nDEHAVEN (into phone) So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside. \nJORDAN (V.O.) Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding? \nDEHAVEN (reading file) High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote. \nINT.  BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY \nOn the phone, Jordan glances around.  Co-workers mull within earshot.  Those out of earshot post E-mail memos on Jordan's computer:  \"Moving up in life.\"  \"I want a full report.\"  \"Don't tell her who you really voted for.\" \n", "test1_true": "A beat as Jordan's mind catches up to her ears.  Now INTERRCUTTING the two: \nJORDAN \"Coronado.\" \nDEHAVEN California. \nJORDAN I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training? \nDEHAVEN This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there? \nJORDAN Captain Dwyer.  Technically. \nDEHAVEN My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now... \nJORDAN Uh, question, ma'am. \nDEHAVEN Yes, dear. \nJORDAN Would I be the only one?  The only woman? \nDEHAVEN There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now... \nThe line goes dead.  Jordan hangs up catatonically. \nJORDAN Well, shit-a-doodle-do... \nEXT.  GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - NIGHT \nA small gunkhole harbor up the Potomac.  Snow falls thick and silent on overturned canoes, stored for the winter. Beyond stands a clapboard rental house. \nINT.  JORDAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's not so much furnished as equipped -- scuba gear and wetsuits in the mud room, life vests on coat racks, a training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living room. In the kitchen we find... \nA naked man.  He's steeping tea. \nJORDAN (O.S.) ... well, I survived Basic Training and three brothers -- so I know how to fight.  What scares me are the sexual politics.  I don't want to be turned into some poster girl for women's rights. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS as the naked man carries a steaming mug through the house... \nINT.  BATHROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n... and sets it down beside Jordan, languishing in a tub. Snow builds on a window sill.  Facing Jordan, the man slides into the tub. \nROYCE So why're you even considering it? Are you? \nJORDAN Just like you would be. \nROYCE Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan. \nJORDAN I take it you don't either.  Feet. \nDutifully, Royce massages her feet. \nROYCE Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel. \nJORDAN Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy? \nROYCE (shaking head) She's haze grey and underway... \nJORDAN You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling. \nROYCE So dump on me. \nJORDAN This has nothing to do with you. \nROYCE (getting out) Well, guess I don't even need to be here... \nJORDAN Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you. \nROYCE You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night. \nJORDAN Sorry.  But after our days... (a thoughtful sip) So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here? \nROYCE I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that -- \nJORDAN Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then? \n", "test2_input": "JORDAN Come on, Montgomery... \nINSTRUCTOR JOHNS Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line? \nFinally Jordan grabs Flea by the neck, pushes him ahead and mounts him.  The class closes down into a long human snake. \nJORDAN (in his ear) Montgomery, why do they call you \"Flea\"? \nFLEA It's really \"F. Lee Montgomery\" -- but that gets whittled down to just \"Flea.\"  For short, ma'am. \nJORDAN So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size? \nFLEA No, ma'am. \nJORDAN Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay? \nFLEA I'll work on it, ma'am. \nJORDAN Do that. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO (to the Chief) Time. \nTHE CHIEF Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast. \nCAMERA POLLS the grim, blue-lipped faces in the water. Jordan feels Flea starting to shake.  Badly. \nJORDAN Hey.  You okay, Flea? \nFLEA 'Snot me.  It's him. \nTwo bodies ahead, it's the big bruiser, Miller, who's shuddering.  Jordan feels him shaking through Flea. \nMILLER Jesus, my hands... they aren't workin' right... \nNEWBERRY How long i'zis for? \nWICKWIRE 'Sposed to be 20-minute intervals, no more. \nNEWBERRY Swear each time's gettin' longer. \nMCCOOL This where you bailed last time, Wick? \nWICKWIRE Huh-uh -- but wasn't middla February last time, either. \nFLEA How you doin', Miller?  Miller? \nNo answer.  Bad sign.  On shore: \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO 22 minutes... \nIgnoring, the Chief lifts his bullhorn: \nTHE CHIEF Remember, all this is completely voluntary.  For any of you who don't want to continue, Instructor Johns is now serving coffee and danish at the ambulance. \nA portable light comes on.  Indeed, an instructor is setting up coffee service. \nTHE CHIEF Any takers? \nSLUTNIK He's the fuckin' Antichrist. \nMCCOOL Wick!  They really got donuts over there?  Or just some'a last night's dinner rolls? \nFLEA Look like donuts to me... \nJORDAN (in disbelief) What're you guys doing?  Huh? \nMCCOOL Just askin' \nJORDAN What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they -- \nSuddenly the line rips apart.  It's Miller, breaking for shore. \nCLASS NO! \nSoon the dyke is bursting everywhere:  Four others break rank, following Miller's lead. \nThe deserters stagger onto the beach.  MEDICS close in quick, draping them with blankets, shining flashlights in their faces, asking brain-check question. \nMEDICS Tell me what day this is... look at me now... what city are you from, sailor... here, look right here... \n", "test2_true": "THE CHIEF You want another minute to think about this?  Huh? (no response; to Miller directly) Do any of you want to reconsider? \nAvoiding his eyes, Miller wags his head. \nTHE CHIEF Johnson.  Get 'em out of my scan. \nIt's a death sentence.  As the quitters slouch for the coffee truck... \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO By my watch... which, of course appears to be broken... they've been in 27 minutes without the benefit of protective gear. \nTIGHT on the Chief.  Scanning the remaining trainees. Thinking about holding out out for one more. \nTIGHT on Jordan.  Knowing who he's waiting for.  Wondering if she can outlast him. \nTHE CHIEF (into bullhorn) Everybody out. \nWith a SHIVERING CHEER, the trainees stampede ashore, grabbing blankets, trading body-bumps and high-fives. Jordan gets swept up in the esprit:  They've conquered a common enemy.  But when she tries to get high-fived... \nThe guys turn their backs.  It's a cold rebuff, worse then any water. \nHOLD TIGHT on Jordan.  Shivering.  Watching the guys drift away.  Hating them. \nWICKWIRE Hey.  Way to gut it out. \nJORDAN Thanks, Wick. \nINT.  INSTRUCTOR'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nThe instructors are shuffling muster lists, reorganizing the class.  B.G., the BELL TOLLS again and again. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO (shaking head) Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him. \nTHE CHIEF Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different. \nEXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nBlondell crosses the grinder with another female ensign, tall and striking.  Passing the bell, Blondell checks on... \nThe helmets lined up beneath.  A dozen already. \nAn O.S. CADENCE CALL -- then, led by Wickwire, trainees double-time into the grinder, uniforms drenched from a beach run.  Among them, still, is Jordan.  It brings a Mona Lisa smile to Blondell's face. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO Change those clothes, be back here in six minutes!  And I am timing you! \nThe class scatters.  Slutnik hits the brakes when he sees Blondell and her friend. \nSLUTNIK Jesus Christ.  And I only got three minutes apiece... \nENGLAND (jerking him away) Barkin' up the wrong dress, Slutnik. You ain't their type. \nOverhearing, Jordan snaps a look at Blondell, only now realizing.  Their eyes meet. \nINSTRUCTOR PYRO O'Neil!  What're you gawking at? \nINT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY \nP.R. FLAK (reading newspaper) \"... last week at Coronado.  The woman, identity unknown, is believed to be the first female candidate for the elite Special Reconnaissance program.  Her presence could signal a shift in the Navy's long-standing policy that excludes women from combat positions.\" \nThe P.R. FLAK drops the newspaper on the C.O.'s desk. It's the San Diego Tribune.  Under the headline \"G.I. JANE,\" a photo shows a chesty sailor running the obstacle course. \nC.O. (calling O.S.) I'm asking again.  Where is she? \nYEOMAN Inbound now, sir.  Had to pull her out of the dive bell. \nP.R. FLAK I have interview requests from two local TV stations.  And a sociologist from U.C. San Diego called, wanted to know if she could examine the interaction between \"G.I. Jane\" and the men. \nC.O. \"A sociol...\"  Kill the interviews. I don't need civilians nosin' around in matters that are supposed to be covert in nature.  Just kill 'em before this whole thing gets outta con -- \nYEOMAN Senator DeHaven calling, sir. \nThe C.O. gets an instant headache. \nINT.  SENATE BARBER SHOP - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nC.O. (V.O.) Base Commander Turrentine speaking. \nIn the Senate barber shop, DeHaven is having her hair colored.  She holds a fax of the Tribune article in one hand, a cell phone in the other. \n", "test3_input": "EXT.  CAPITOL BLDG. - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY \nThe real Capitol dome.  A flag is being raised over the Senate Wing. \nEXT.  CAPITOL BDLG.  - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY \nA car parks at barricades.  Jordan and Royce emerge, both in uniforms. \nD.C. COP Don't even dream about leaving that vehicle there. \nROYCE Government car -- tow it if you want.  Just point us to DeHaven's office first. \nNot waiting for directions, Jordan takes the Capitol steps two at a time.  We've seen this look on her face before -- and last time, she nearly knocked the grinder bell into orbit. \nINT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nJordan and Royce move quickly down a corridor, eyes hunting, passing CAPITOL GUIDES and their tourists.  Soon they find... \nDeHaven's office.  A Navy captain exits with paperwork. Hasty salutes. \nROYCE Capt'n. \nNAVY CAPTAIN Commander. \nThe captain moves on.  Royce holds in the doorway a beat, memory nagging him.  Again he looks at... \nThe captain.  He has a distinct bald spot. \nROYCE (to Jordan) Get started here.  I'll catch up. \nPicking up where he left off a few weeks ago, Royce follows Bald Spot around a corner... \nINT.  PRIVATE STAIRCASE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \n... down a private staircase... \nINT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \n... and through a door marked \"Naval Appropriation Liaison Office.\"  It's not 30 seconds from DeHaven's door. \nINT.  FOYER - DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nSECRETARY Your name again? \nJORDAN Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil. \nIn a side office, DeHaven's aide overhears.  He rises quickly and enters the foyer. \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE Ms. O'Neil.  Yes, of course.  I'm Douglas Champeau.  Unfortunately, the Senator is in chamber right now. How can I help you? \nJORDAN What chamber?  Which way is that? \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE I mean, she's on the floor of the Senate. \nJORDAN Okay, which way? \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE She really can't be disturbed.  But if you care to wait, I'll find you an office with a phone.  It might be several hours, but -- \nA TOURIST pokes in. \nTOURIST 'Scuse me, but I'm here to pick up gallery tickets?  Are you... \nDEHAVEN'S AIDE See the secretary, please. \nOver the aide's shoulder, Jordan watches as... \nThe tourist claims tickets.  HOLD on the bureau near the secretary's desk where the tickets are stored. \nINT.  SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nOn the chamber floor, SENATORS mull about, consulting aides, polling party mates.  PAGES place microphones and fill the ceremonial snuff boxes, readying the room for session.  Among the activity, we find... \nDeHaven.  Caucusing with another Democrat. \nJORDAN (O.S.) Senator DeHaven... \nDeHaven looks behind her.  Nobody. \nJORDAN DeHaven... \n", "test3_true": "Jordan standing in the gallery.  Staring down on DeHaven as she is, it's hard to read anything into her expression but open disdain. \nDrawn by Jordan's voice, a CAPITOL GUARD hurries down the gallery steps.  Royce runs interference. \nJORDAN We can talk here or we can talk outside, Senator.  You tell me. \nOn the floor, half the U.S. Senate stops what it's doing and looks up. \nIn the gallery, the guard is thrown off-balance by the naval uniforms:  Do Royce and Jordan belong here or not? Confused, he looks for guidance from... \nDeHaven.  She notes C-SPAN cameras swinging Jordan's way. Summoning a page: \nDEHAVEN Cloak room.  I'll meet her there. Just her. \nINT.  CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY \nTowering doors swing open.  DeHaven appears, face pleasant but harried. \nDEHAVEN Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that -- \nJORDAN Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire. \nAbout to hug Jordan, DeHaven stops awkwardly. \nJORDAN You know him. \nDEHAVEN Sounds familiar. \nJORDAN It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me. \nDEHAVEN Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely -- \nJORDAN Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail? \nDEHAVEN Absolutely not. \nDeHaven glances back at the doors to the Senate chamber -- the open doors.  Walking Jordan a few steps away: \nDEHAVEN Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent. \nJORDAN What changed? \nDEHAVEN Should probably ask him that. \nJORDAN If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras. \nIt's a threat DeHaven doesn't appreciate.  The Senate DOORKEEPER appears. \nDOORKEEPER Madam Senator?  Your esteemed colleagues are requesting -- \nDEHAVEN Two seconds, Walter. (answering Jordan) In 1981, the Supreme Court was asked to rule on the issue of women in combat positions.  The Court cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws as a legal foundation for keeping women ineligible.  That decision held for all these years -- until the White House, 10 days ago, moved to have the Exclusion Laws voided. To demolish that legal foundation. \nJORDAN So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon? \nDEHAVEN What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way. \nJORDAN You don't know that. \nDEHAVEN In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same. \nJORDAN What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more? \nDEHAVEN I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags. \nJordan shakes her head in disbelief.  She has met the enemy -- and she is us. \nJORDAN You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did. \nDEHAVEN Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory. \nJORDAN So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble. \nDEHAVEN The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women. (off Jordan's look) Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with -- \nJORDAN I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been. \nDOORKEEPER Madam Senator, once again I must -- \n"}

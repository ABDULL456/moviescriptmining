DENVER I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D. 
Silence. 
PAUL That girl...You know, Beloved... 
DENVER Yes? 
PAUL She gone like they say? 
DENVER Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it. 
PAUL You think she sure 'nough your sister? 
DENVER At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her. 
She levels her eyes at him and he knows what she means. 
PAUL Well, if you want my opinion... 
DENVER I don't. I have my own. 
PAUL You grown. 
DENVER Yes sir 
PAUL Well, good luck with the job. 
DENVER Thank you. 
They pass each other until Denver turns back; 
DENVER And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear? 
PAUL I will. 
Paul watches her walk away. He watches as a YOUNG BLACK MAN runs towards her shouting; 
YOUNG MAN Hey, Miss Denver..Wait up! 
He watches as the two young people, the future, walk together. 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
Paul enters the house and hears HUMMING. He walks towards the keeping room, whose door is ajar; 
INT. KEEPING ROOM - DAY. 
Sethe lies in bed with the remnants of Baby Sugg's quilt over her, as she hums her melody and looks out of the window. 
PAUL Sethe? 
SETHE (turns to him) Paul D. 
She looks like she's dying. 
PAUL Aw, Sethe. 
He approaches her. 
SETHE You shaved. 
PAUL Yeah. Look bad? 
SETHE No, You looking good. 
PAUL Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed? (no response) I saw Denver. She tell you? 
SETHE She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver. 
PAUL (nervous) You got to get up from here, girl. 
SETHE I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while. 
PAUL (getting upset, shouts) Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!? 
SETHE Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all. 
PAUL Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now. 
Sethe looks at him - a long look - and sees in him that thing, that blessedness, "that makes him the kind of man who can walk into a house and make women cry, make women tell him things they could only tell each other". 
PAUL What, baby? 
SETHE (cries) She left me. She's gone again. 
PAUL Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow... 
SETHE She was my best thing. 
Paul leans down and takes her hand, entwining his fingers into hers... 
PAUL You your best thing, Sethe. You are. 
Sethe smiles, with tears in her eyes, looking almost surprised; 
SETHE Me?...Me? 
EXT. THE CLEARING - A DAY OUT OF TIME. 
A beautiful, sunny day. The clearing is full. Everyone looks bright and hopeful. Dressed in bright, summer clothes... 
A robust Baby Suggs is on her rock giving her best Call, as camera pans the crowd of faces eager to believe .... 
BABY SUGGS ..The only grace we can have, is the grace we can imagine. If you cannot see it, you will not have it...Here, in this place, we are flesh. Flesh that weeps, laughs, dances on bare feet in the grass. Love it. Love it hard. Yonder they do not love your flesh. They despise it. They flay it. O, my people, they do not love your hands. Those they only use, tie, bind, chop off and leave empty, Love your hands. Love them. Raise them up and kiss them. Touch others with them, put them together, stroke them on your face 'cause they don't love that either. You  got to love it. You. Yonder out there, they ain't in love with your moth. They will see it broken and break it again. What you say out of it, they will not heed. What you scream from it they do not hear. No, they don't love your mother. You got to love it. And the feet that need to rest and to dance. The backs that needs support. The shoulders that need arms, strong arms I'm telling you! O my people, out yonder they don't love your neck unnoosed and straight. So love your neck; put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and hold it up. Love all your inside parts, love 'em..and the beating heart, love that too. More than eyes or feet. More than lungs that have yet to draw free air, love your heart. For this is the prize. 
And with her twisted, broken old body BABY SUGGS BEGINS TO DANCE AND TWIRL UP ON HER ROCK. 
And the crowd gives her music, SINGING IN FOUR PART HARMONY. CAMERA PANS THE CROWD OF BEAUTIFUL FACES singing together. Among the crowd, we see FAMILIAR FACES... 
WE SEE THE WOMEN WHO SANG AT 124... 
WE STAMP PAID, ELLA, JOHN, and LADY JONES...

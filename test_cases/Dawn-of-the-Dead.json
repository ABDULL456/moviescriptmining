{"train": "DAWN OF THE DEAD (The working draft 1977) by George A. Romero \n1\tWe see the face of a young woman. She is asleep. It is very quiet at first, as credits appear. The woman's face begins to twitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly and her expression grows more desperate. \nA mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we can discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national emergency. \nThe woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The woman sits up, snapping awake. \n2\tShe lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man. She is Francine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although she is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and sweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days. \nShe is sitting on the floor, where she has slept the last several hours, covered by an old overcoat. \nTony:\tYOU OK? \nFran stares at the young man. She is shaking. She doesn't speak. \nTony:\tTHE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN. \nThe girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to where others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time. We begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They have an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran looks about. She is still shaken from her dream. \n3\tWe see the television studio. Reporters buzz about madly. Everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man monitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing emotionally. \n4\tVoice:\tWHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN? WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, WHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN. \nVoice:\tYES, BUT THAT'S... \nVoice:\tTHAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STUDY. THEY'RE TRYING... \nVoice:\tBUT IF WE KNEW THAT, WE COULD... \nVoice:\tWE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW! \n5\tThe room is pandemonium. People run in with wire copy; others organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip over cables and generally get in each other's way. \n6\tFrancine stares at the madness, still trying to clear her head. \nMan's voice: I'M STILL DREAMING. \nFran turns her head. Another young man sits next to her on the floor. He is one of the ones Tony awakened. \nFran:\tNO YOU'RE NOT. \nWoman:\tMY TURN WITH THE COAT. \nFran looks up. A young woman is offering her coffee in a paper cup. She is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours sleep. Fran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet. \nWoman:\tTHE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY. A BUNCH OF 'EM FLEW THE COOP ALREADY. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE'LL BE ABLE TO STAY ON AIR. \n7\tFran staggers over to the control consoles. The technicians are at the end of their ropes. \nTechnicians: (all at once) WATCH CAMERA TWO...WHO THE HELL'S ON CAMERA TWO, A BLIND MAN... WATCH THE FRAME...WATCH THE FRAME... ROLL THE RESCUE STATIONS AGAIN. \nTechnicians: WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE STATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT. SO GET ME A NEW LIST. SURE, I'LL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS. \nFran focuses on the monitors. She is incredulous... stunned by the madness which surrounds her. She realises the hopelessness of the situation as she zeroes in on the televised conversation. \n8\tWe begin to listen over the din of the news room. \nTV Man 1:    I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DOCTOR, AND I DON'T BELIEVE... \nTV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO LIFE? \nTV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO... \nTV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO LIFE AND ATTACKING THE LIVING? \nTV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE DOCTOR! \n9\tSuddenly we cut into the studio, and we see the argument as it is being shot. \nTV Man 1:    (con't) ALL WE GET IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE TELL US. AND IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE... \nTV Man 2:    IT'S FACT... IT'S FACT... \nTV Man 1:    IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WITHOUT YOU COMING IN HERE AND TELLING US WE HAVE TO FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY AND... \nTV Man 2:    HUMAN DIG... YOU CAN'T... \nTV Man 1:    ...FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY... \nTV Man 2:    YOU'RE NOT RUNNING A TALK SHOW HERE, MR. BERMAN...YOU CAN FORGET PITCHING AN AUDIENCE THE MORAL BULL SHIT THEY WANT TO HEAR! \nTV Man 1:    YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN CODE OF BEHAVIOUR, AND THERE'S A LOT OF US WHO AREN'T READY FOR THAT DOCTOR FOSTER... \nRoger:\tKEEP COOL. JUST DON'T POP OFF IN THERE WHEN WE GO IN. \nThe boy nods, grateful for a more human contact. \nWooley:\t HOW THE HELL COME WE STICK THESE LOW LIFES IN THESE BIG ASS FANCY HOTELS ANYWAY? SHIT MAN. THIS' BETTER THAN I GOT. YOU AIN'T GONNA TALK 'EM OUTA HERE. YOU GOTTA BLOW 'EM OUT. BLOW THEIR ASSES! \nRoger:\t(to the boy) YOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT? \nThe boy nods in the affirmative. \nWooley:\t LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THIS IS A WASTE OF MY TIME! \n44\t CRASH! Without warning, the metal door to the fire stair bursts open and several figures rush out of the darkness. Shots are fired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the skull of the young boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a pleading expression on his face. \nFigures charge this way and that. More gunfire. The other S.W.A.T. men dodge and dive for cover. Wooley opens fire with his automatic weapon. \n45\t On the street, the Commander, hearing the gunfire, barks into the bullhorn: \nCommander:   MOVE IN...MOVE IN... GODDAMMIT! \nSergeant:    (into walkie talkie) ALL UNITS... FULL OPERATION! \n46\t On the roof, Roger struggles under the dead weight of the young man. He tries to free himself and his weapons. Shots ring out. \nA handful of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters charge about the rooftop. Another S.W.A.T. patrol appears from behind a large elevator housing. The young civilians retreat. Several are mowed down. \nAnother bullet smashes against the dead S.W.A.T. man's back. Just as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in the chest, but his armour takes the impact. He is thrown back off balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof top. \nBefore he reaches the gun, he is cut off by the looming figure of one of the Black youths, pistol in hand. Roger freezes. The young man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. A sudden barrage of bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of blood. It was Wooley's gun that killed him. \nWooley:\t COME ON YOU DUMB BASTARDS... COME AND GET 'EM... \nHe fires again and again, even though the skirmish is winding down. \nRoger charges for his weapon, snatches it up, and runs for the cover of an incinerator housing. He startles a young civilian who was hiding there, trying to load his gun. The boy makes a break... \nRoger:\tHOLD IT... \nThe boy freezes for a moment, then, thinking, breaks into a run across the roof. \nRoger:\tHOLD IT, KID...DON'T RUN OUT THERE! \nThe boy is mowed down in a crossfire. \n47\t Inside the building, other S.W.A.T. teams along with units of the National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking into apartment units. People are herded into the halls where they are held at gun point. \nSome men, although armed, surrender willingly. Others retaliate against the invading force, and little skirmishes develop on every floor of the complex structure. \n48\t On the ground, the Commander barks into the bullhorn: \nCommander:   MASKS... \nSergeant:    (into walkie talkie) MASKS FOR GAS...MASKS FOR GAS. \n49\t Tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are filled with clouds of gas. Civilians trying to escape, are choked as they attempt to shoot their way out. \n50\t The teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the building. \nS.W.A.T. 1:  WORK YOUR WAY DOWN. A FLOOR AT A TIME. HOLD 'EM IN THE HALLS 'TIL WE CAN WORK 'EM DOWN THE STAIRS. \nRoger and Wooley and the men in their unit, snap on their bizarre looking gas masks. \n51\t The troopers break into an apartment on the floor. An old couple kneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and their children's children huddle in a corner. The young husband surrenders his gun to a trooper, and Roger watches as the group is led into the hallway. \nSuddenly, a young Black man charges out of one of the apartments. A woman appears at the door, screaming for him to stop. He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his automatic. The black man crashes to the floor. Wooley is crazed. He kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly into the room. \nThe flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the hall. The younger ones try to escape while the older people kneel or fall against the walls praying. \nS.W.A.T. 2:  WOOLEY'S GONE APE SHIT, MAN... \nRoger:\tWOOLEY! (shouting) \nWooley kicks in the door of another apartment. Roger charges at him and grabs him around the shoulders. The big man resists. His gun fires and bullets fly wildly. He struggles against Roger, but Roger manages to hold on. \nRoger:\tGIMME A HAND...SOMEBODY... \nAnother S.W.A.T. Trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas. He is very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a deep voice. \nTrooper:\tSTEP AWAY FROM HIM. \nRoger:\tGIMME A HAND. \nWooley throws his body around and slams Roger against the wall, but Roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling off his gun at the open apartment door. \nRoger stares up at the grim faced Black. \nRoger:\tI COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT. \nThe black man just stares levelly into Roger's eyes. \nRoger:\tFRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER. HE DOES TRAFFIC FOR J.A.S. GOT A HELICOPTER AND HE'S RUNNIN' OUT WITH IT. AS'T ME T'COME. \nThe Black man smiles. \nRoger:\tYOU THINK IT'S RIGHT TO RUN? \nThe Black man shrugs again, then he stands and walks down the stairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down into the lingering gas mist. Roger follows. \n62\t A few landings down...a noise. The two Troopers freeze. The stairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready their weapons. \nThe sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls of someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath. \nThe men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward slightly, trying not to make a sound. \nSuddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. It falls against the wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls away from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly... robed...in black...is sees the Troopers... \nFigure:\t SENORES... PLEASE TO LET ME PASS... \nThe voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. The figure slumps and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish. \nRoger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his breath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at his chest. \nRoger tries to support him. \nRoger:\tLET'S GET HIM TO THE MEDICS... \nPriest:\t NO...NO...NO...PLEASE. JUST...LET ME PASS...MY SISTER...I GO UP TO SEVEN FLOOR...TO FIND MY SISTER... \nRoger:\tTHEY'RE TAKIN' EVERYONE DOWN...THEY PROBABLY BROUGHT HER DOWN...COME ONE... \nPriest:\t MY SISTER...SHE IS DEAD...THEY TELL ME... THE DEAD THEY DO NOT BRING DOWN. \nRoger and the Black Trooper shoot glances at one another. \nPriest:\t JUST LET ME PASS. MARTINEZ IS DEAD. THE PEOPLE OF 107 WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH NOW. THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE... BUT STRONG...THEY HAVE LITTLE...BUT THEY DO NOT GIVE IT UP EASILY. AND THEY GIVE UP THEIR DEAD...TO NO ONE! \nThe Priest goes into a coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger wants to help in some way. \nPriest:\t MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST WEEKS...IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING YOU FIND THEM... \nThe Troopers are shocked. The Priest struggles to his feet. \nPriest:\t I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES. NOW...YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL... \nThe old man starts up the stairs. Roger moves to help him, but the big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the gas mist, coughing. \nPriest:\t YOU ARE STRONGER THAN US...BUT SOON, I THINK...THEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU... \nThe old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears in the cloud... \nPriest:\t WHEN THE DEAD WALK, SENORES...WE MUST STOP THE KILLING...OR WE LOSE THE WAR... \n63\t In the basement of the large building, S.W.A.T. troopers pry at the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage area. \nThe rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers... \nThe nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are silent, not knowing what to expect. \nThere are three boards left...then two... \nWith a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies pushes into the hall. \nThey are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They are all ages, from the very old to the very young. \nThe riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough, and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring other troopers. \nThe men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush. \nCommander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT... \nThe rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by clutching ghouls. \nRoger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle. They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless onslaught. \n64\t As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage area, several Troopers move into the room. \nThe walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture. \nHe pulls her quickly along. They have to actually step over the civilian corpse. Fran freezes again. She can't bring herself to walk over the body. Steve lets go of her hand and checking the tank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back to Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the civilian corpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood still runs. The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with Fran following. \n71\t At the side of the machine, the blades still spinning overhead, Steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle. He pulls one of Fran's hands into the nozzle mechanism. \nSteve:\tJUST LIKE THIS...LIKE A CAR... \nFran responds, getting the feel of the nozzle trigger. \nSteve:\tTHAT'S IT...JUST HOLD HER THERE 'TIL SHE SPITS OUT AT YA. \nThe woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard shed. The propeller blades still spin. They make an eerie, whispering sound as they pass over Fran's head. She can hear the lapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting docks. She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes. \n72\t At the guard house, Stephen rushes in to find the dead radio operator. A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code. The corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send key. A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the dead man's head. As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect posture in its chair, he sees that the exit of the bullet all but obliterated the corpse's face. Again the wound is still running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the desk and the radio unit. \nStephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send a message in Morse: \nOPERATOR DEAD...POST ABANDONED... \n73\t Back on the fuel dock, the long hose brushes over the civilian corpse. A shadow moves nearby, making is aware of a presence other than Fran's. \n74\t The woman switches hands on the pump nozzle. The blades still whoosh overhead. Then she hears the sound of another engine. She looks towards the mainland. The headlights of an approaching vehicle can be seen. \n75\t At the guard house, Stephen, hearing the approaching engine, steps into the doorway and looks up the dock. He calls to Fran. \nSteve:\tI HOPE IT'S ROGER. \n76\t Fran:\tWHAT ARE YOU DOING? \nSteve:\tI'LL BE RIGHT THERE. \n77\t He ducks back into the shed. He snatches up a First Aid Kit and throws it into a khaki knapsack. He rummages in the darkness. He finds a toolbox. \nAs he stands up, he backs into a tall figure which stands in the shadows. Feeling something sharp and hard against his back. Steve recoils and spins to face the figure. It is a uniformed officer. His rifle is levelled off at Steve's chest. From out of the shadows, a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked and aimed. \n78\t Fran's eyes strain to discern the approaching vehicle, but suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision. Through the open sides of the helicopter bubble, she notices a Police van. It has been there all along, it's doors flung wide open, as though abandoned hurriedly. Now one of the rear doors move. A figure appears carrying a large packing carton. The figure is uniformed, with two rifles strapped to its back. It rushes toward the launch docks. \nVoice:\tJUST STAY COOL. \nFran, already startled by the running figure, is now doubly shocked by the calm voice behind her. She spins and the fuel nozzle clatters out of it's receptacle to the wooden dock boards. She is facing another \"Policeman\", to aims a rifle directly at her head. \nOfficer 1:   IF YOU DIE...IT'LL BE YOUR OWN FAULT. \nThe Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the Guard House. \nOfficer 2:   COME ON SKIPPER...THEY GOT FRIENDS COMIN'. \n79\t In the Guard House, Steve is held at bay by one of the Officers while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the progress of the approaching vehicles. \nOfficer 3:   WHO ARE YOU? \nSteve:\tWE'RE WITH J.A.S...WE... \nOfficer 4:   (at the door) ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF. (referring to the arrival time of the vehicle) \nOfficer 3, the Skipper, pushes Steve with his gun barrel. Steve spins out through the open doorway. He looks up the dock and sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is almost a mile long. \n80\t Officer 1 has moved around Fran and he reaches into the helicopter bubble pulling out Steve's rifle. \n81\t Steve:\tNOW WAIT A MINUTE...WE'RE JUST HERE TO REFUEL... THESE MEN WERE ALREADY DEAD...YOU WERE HERE... YOU KNOW THAT...IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS AFTER THE LAUNCHES...WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH... \nOfficer 3:   (looking at the insignia on the helicopter) HEY...J.A.S. TRAFFIC WATCH... STEVE ANDREWS. \nSteve:\t(trying to capitalise on his minor celebrity power) RIGHT...THAT'S ME...I'M STEVE ANDREW... \nOfficer 3:   NO SHIT. \n82\t Officer 1:   (shouting from the helicopter) WE'D GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD, SKIPPER. \n83\t Steve freezes again, sensing that these are not law enforcers. \n84\t The man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the dock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches. \nOfficer 2:   CAN'T ALL FIT. \n85\t Officer 3:   (directly to Stephen) HOW MANY WILL THAT THING HOLD? \nOfficer 4:   HEY, MAN, I AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE IN NOTHIN' I CAN'T DRIVER MYSELF! \n86\t Officer 2 has returned to the van and is carrying out another carton rushing back to the launch. \nOfficer 2:   THAT'S TRUE...SOMETHIN' HAPPENS TO HIM AND WE'RE STUCK. STAY WITH THE LAUNCH! \nOfficer 1:   GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD! \n129\tThe two creatures advance slowly on Fran and Steve. \nSteve:\tJUST RUN. \nFran is petrified. She turns and looks behind them. They are boxed in by the hangars. \nSteve:\tRUN RIGHT PAST 'EM...RIGHT AROUND 'EM. THEY CAN'T CATCH YOU. \nShe hesitates. The Zombies draw closer. \nSteve:\tRUN, FRANNIE. GODDAMMIT, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU. WE CAN HANDLE THEM! \nFran charges up the little grade. She runs to the right of the creatures and they move in her direction, arms outstretched. As she draws near to the dead things, she hesitates again in fright. The creatures claw at the air. The one in front is within a few feet of the woman. \nSteve:\tRUN, FRANNIE. MOVE! \nFran stares into the dead, staring eyes of the lead Zombie. She is almost hypnotised. At the last instant, she runs and just gets past the creatures. A little up the grade, she turns and looks back, stopping again. \nOne Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran. The other continues to advance on Stephen. \n130\tStephen ducks back into the open hangar. It is very dark but for thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden boards of the structure. Stephen roots around among the greasy tools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge hammer. He runs out of the shed. \n131\tHe dodges around the lead Zombie, who staggers on with inertia. Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the grade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming against the ghoul's skull with all his might. \nThe creature staggers on for a few more steps, its head a bloody pulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in the dust. \nWithout breaking stride, Stephen grabs Fran's hand and the two run toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has turned around and is walking up the grade. \n132\tRoger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he sees the frightened couple making for the chopper. \n133\tAs Steve charges up the grade he sees the Zombie approaching Roger from behind.  Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The stumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its hands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the ground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't have his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun holster. \nSuddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature has walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap. \n134\tStephen and Fran have reached the chopper. Steve let's go of the woman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in the propeller draft. \n135\tThe Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars almost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and advances steadily toward the helicopter. \n136\tThe shot misses clean. He fires again. The bullet grazes the creature's face. It staggers from the impact, but does not fall. \n137\tRoger moves quickly for his high powered weapon. Steve fires two more rounds. \n138\tAnother miss and another graze, this time on the arm. \n139\tHe is about to shoot once more when Roger stops him, stepping up alongside. \nRoger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the creatures' brain. \n140\tThe Zombie falls and papers blow over its body. \n141\tIn the chart house. Peter fires several more shots into the closet door. Bullet holes appear just where the creature's head should be. There seems to be no way that the volley could have missed. \nSilence for a moment. Peter still holds his gun high. \nThen, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the room. Two small children burst out. One has no left arm; the other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. They are dead. They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door. \nPeter stares down at the creatures, revulsed.  He is so startled that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival instincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and thrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is about to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small Zombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces on his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes against its brother. \nNow Peter raises his gun. As the children try to scramble to their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession. First one creature falls; then the other. \nPeter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and disgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition. \nPeter breathes heavily. He stares at the small corpses. Instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door of the chart house. \n142\tBehind him, in the brightly sunlit doorway, we see the Zombie who first appeared at the window. The creature staggers forward. Peter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun. The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room. \nPeter stares into the creatures eyes. Then suddenly, out in the sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears with his rifle. Peter sees the man over the creature's shoulder. \n143\tSteve raises his gun and aims at the Zombie, but the barrel seems to be on a straight line with Peter. \n144\tPeter ducks quickly. Steve's gun fires. The bullet misses the creature cleanly and crashes into the room. It ricochets off the coffee machine. Another shot crashes through the glass in the front room. \nPeter crouches, still stuffing shells into his weapon. A third of Stephen's bullets tears through the Zombie's shoulder, but the creature still stands. It turns toward Peter slowly. Peter crawls under the table as another shot splatters into the coffee cups. \n145\tOnce again, Roger steps up beside Stephen.  He fires one carefully aimed shot, looking through his telescopic range- finder. \n146\tJust as Peter finishes loading his weapon, the Zombie crashes into the room, falling over the table and onto the floor. \n147\tFran is still kneeling in the dust, trying to keep herself from vomiting. Stephen rushes to her side. Roger, keeping his rifle poised, shouts toward the chart house. \nRoger:\tPETER. \n148\tThe big Black man appears in the doorway, snapping the safety on his rifle. \n167\tFran:\t(still staring down through a bubble) WHAT ARE THEY DOING? WHY DO THEY COME HERE? \nSteve:\t(also looking down) SOME KIND OF INSTINCT. MEMORY...OF WHAT THEY USED TO DO. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN THEIR LIVES. \n168\tBelow, the Zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the plaza. Some try the gates but cannot budge them. One wanders out of the single open shop, it is a female. The shop is an appliance store. As the creature leaves she drags a toaster idly behind her, pulling it by its power cable. It scrapes on the floor loudly. \n169\tWe see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an intricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of the roof surface.  Behind the structures can be seen a large power generator. \n170\tPeter:\tSOLAR SCREENS. \nRoger:\tCAN'T BE ENOUGH TO POWER THIS PLACE. \nPeter:\tEMERGENCY SYSTEM, MAYBE. \nRoger:\tIT'S PRETTY LIT UP IN THERE. \nPeter:\tGUESS THE POWER'S NOT OFF IN THIS AREA. A LOT OF PHILLY'S STILL LIT. COULD BE NUCLEAR. \n171\tRoger:\tHEY LOOK AT THIS! \nRoger is peering down through a wire-hatched skylight. There are several laid out over this particular area of the roof. He moves to another while Peter looks down into the first. Fran and Stephen jog up. \nRoger:\tTHESE DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE MALL. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? \nFran and Stephen peer down into the darkness. Peter pulls a flashlight from his utility belt.  He has stayed in full uniform all the while, where Roger has stripped off all but his ammunition belt and pistol holster. \n172\tThe big man shines a light beam down into the space. The floor is only seven feet or so below the window. There is absolutely nothing in sight; clear floor, clear walls, all light grey. \nPeter:\tDAMN. \n173\tRoger has moved to another window. \nRoger:\tHEY, OVER HERE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' HERE. \n174\tPeter trots over and shines his beam down. They see a vast array of cardboard cartons...hundreds of them. \nRoger:\tSTORAGE? \n175\tPeter moves the light beam. Now it illuminates a collection of large drums, stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the line of vision. On the face of each drum is the familiar symbol of a triangle within a circle, and the letters C.D. \n176\tPeter:\tCIVIL DEFENCE. CIVIL DEFENCE WATER SUPPLY. \nRoger:\tAND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD! \nSteve:\tHOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE? \nPeter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a hopeless city-slick-sissy. Then the big man brings his rifle butt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to the floor below. \n177\tInside - the vast space is impressive. It is quite dark but for rays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights. We see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums, it is very quiet. The space is barren except for the stacks of Civil Defence supplies. \n178\tSuddenly, a figure drops out of one of the skylights, landing on its feet in the sunray. It is Peter.\tInstantly he readies his rifle, looking this way and that across the large room. Silence. \nPeter:\tOK. \nHe steps aside and Roger climbs in. He too drops cat-like to the floor.179\tThe two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food cartons as by pre-arranged plan. They carry the big boxes quickly, one at a time, to the spot under the open skylight.\tIn a moment, they have built a pyramid out of the cartons. It creates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window above. \n180\tNow Fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down the cartons holding onto Roger's hand. She is followed by an anxious Stephen.181\tPeter has already wandered off. There are only two doors in the enormous room, one at either end. The big Trooper moves up to one of them as Roger comes up behind him, gun ready.\tPeter's hand turns the doorknob. It is unlocked, and the big man gives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his rifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire. Then, with a sudden, commando-like motion. Peter throws the door open and ducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all but pulling his trigger, but there is no apparent danger. \n182\tThe door opens onto another vast room, equivalent to the one the people are in. It also has stacks of C.D. supplies. \nThe Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door. The room is empty. The same sunrays pierce the darkness through skylights. All is dead quiet. This room has no doors at all, but for the one Peter opened. Roger:\tDOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183\tIn the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the cartons. \nFran:\tSPAM! \nRoger walks back into the room. Roger:\tYOU BRING A CAN OPENER? \nFran:\tOH. \nRoger:\tTHEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY. \nThe woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little key. \nPeter has walked right past the group.  He is moving quickly toward the still-unknown door at the other end of the room. Again, Roger follows. \n184\tAt the door, the two Troopers go through the same S.W.A.T. procedure. The door swings open, this time onto a very small space. Again no immediate danger. \n185\tAs the men enter, they discover that they are on the top landing of a concrete and metal firestair. There are no windows, and the air is musty. There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling, but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and there the stairs wind even further down; they recede into blackness. \nRoger:\tWHATD'YA THINK? \nThe Black man just stares, first down into the darkness then back into the storage area. \nRoger:\tTHIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE. WHATD'YA THINK? CUT. \nSteve:\tJESUS CHRIST... THEY'RE MANIACS. \n221\tThe Troopers step over the corpse. The second Zombie, the arm less female, is walking toward them. This time Roger fires his weapon. The creature falls in a heap.\tRoger:\tWHATD'YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT? Peter:\tYOU GAME?\tRoger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall.\tTheir rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important mission. \nThe men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for it. They run from the corridor onto the balcony.222\tThe battle to win the mall has begun. The creatures which wander the first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are confused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering strides.223\tSeveral of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224\tA few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against each other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving steps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its balance holding on to the hand rail. 225\tAt another point down the length of the mall, there is a stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second\tfloor. Several creatures move up the steps. \n226\tAt the top of the firestair, Stephen begins to move down the steps cautiously. His rifle is at the ready. Fran stays on the top landing.\tFran:\tSTEPHEN, DON'T GO DOWN THERE.\t\t\t(he continues) STEPHEN PLEASE! \nSteve:\tIT'S ALRIGHT. \n227\tAt the huge gate which locks off the big Department Store, the two Troopers come to a crashing stop. \n228\tThere is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage point, and in the hall are four or five Zombies. They are about three hundred feet away. \n229\tRoger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the creatures while Peter confronts the lock at the middle of the big roll gate.\tHe fumbles with the keys for a moment until he finally sinks\tthe proper key into the receptacle which is right at the floor.\tThe tumblers turn successfully.\tPeter:\tALRIGHT! \n230\tOn the escalator, the creatures which fell onto the moving steps are being carried up to the balcony. The one supporting himself on the hand rail is still standing. The head of the standing Zombie suddenly becomes visible from Roger's perspective. \n231\tThe Trooper raises his gun and aims for the creature's forehead. \nPeter tries to life the roll gate. It won't move. It is still locked.\tPeter:\tYOU BASTARD! Roger:\tWHAT? \nPeter:\tSTILL LOCKED...(he sees another assembly) ON THE SIDE... \nThe big man moves to the far side of the gate. The same key fits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the escalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to shoot when something catches his eye. \n232\tThe fallen Zombies, which up to now could not be seen behind the\tescalator rail wall, suddenly come tumbling out onto the balcony floor.233\tRoger fires, but his aim is inaccurate.234\tHe hits the standing Zombie in the neck. The creature is thrown\toff balance enough to lose its footing. It falls back down the escalator, but before it reaches the bottom, it stops rolling. The steps carry it back up toward the second floor again. It is still very much alive. The two creatures on the balcony struggle to stand.235\tRoger looks back over his shoulder.236\tThe Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and fifty feet away. \n237\tPeter turns the key in the lock, but again the gate will not lift. It moves slightly, as the middle mechanism and the one on the far right are free, but there is a third lock on the far left. Peter moves to it quickly.238\tOn the first floor concourse, other creatures are beginning to\ttake note of the action upstairs. They start to move.239\tThe Zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach the second floor, but they are far down the main balcony. They will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach the Department Store. \n240\tRoger fires again. \n241\tOne of the nearby Zombies falls in a heap. \n242\tAt the sound of the rifle, Fran gets desperate. \nFran:\tSTEPHEN...FOR GOD'S SAKE...LET'S GET UP ON THE ROOF...243\tSteve is at the middle landing. He stares down into the darkness below. More gunfire can be heard from the mall. \nSteve:\tIT'S ALRIGHT, I'M TELLIN 'YA. THOSE THINGS\t\t\tDON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US.\tMore gunfire can be heard.244\tNow the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble. Peter ducks into the store even as the gate is still rising, but the inertia of the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He jumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its fully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still Peter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three feet above Peter's fingertips.245\tThe Zombies advance.246\tRoger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach the gate.247\tThe Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily. \n248\tPeter grabs a small counter used to display shoes, but it is too heavy for him to move himself. \nPeter:\tHERE...COME ON... \nRoger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help drag the little counter. The men drag it to a point just at the side of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top of it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at Peter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes him to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but out on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt around against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back, but is not dead. \nOther creatures are only a few feet from Peter, whose gun sits on the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his rifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a move and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the right. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into the store.\tNow Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back up\ton the counter.\tPeter:\tBEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU... \nThe creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics display and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. The\tcreature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts to bring it down. \nThere are several creatures right in the archway, now they clutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of the\tgate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other creatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down. Peter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more leverage.\tThe bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two men are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very weak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then one Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets through as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab for Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.\tRoger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the creatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt straight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes limp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate, but the pressure is too great. Roger:\tLET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE... \nThe gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their hands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only big enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through, but they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than Peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse.\tWith his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear except for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand suddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War. Peter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching upward.\tPeter:\tCOME ON...COME ON...\tRoger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by the creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.\tPeter:\tTHE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.\tRoger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm\tclear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down more steadily.\tAt the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store, but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks solidly into place. \nThe two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still moan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers clutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it. There are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the Department Store and several others are making their way along the balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor.\tRoger:\tWELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNA\t\t\tGET BACK?\tPeter:\tLET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST. \nThe two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures outside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's rifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect. \n249\tStephen opens the door into the Administration corridor. \n250\tFrom his perspective, the hall is inactive. He observes the washrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices. \n251\tHe starts into the corridor, letting the firestair door close. \n252\tAt the top of the firestair, Fran can see the beam of light from the open door below. As the door closes, the beam narrows, then it blinks out with a click as the door closes.\tFran:\tSTEPHEN...JESUS GOD... \nShe is very frightened.  She backs into the storage area.253\tShe moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the\troof. She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers.254\tIn the Department Store, Roger is riding down an escalator. He has found a back pack, and it is obviously already filled with goods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor, the surroundings are eerily quiet.255\tHe moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking faces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly startled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around his waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle, where he finds Peter. \n256\tThe big Trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching up a small television. \nRoger:\tHEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT... \n257\tPeter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something which we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods. Roger:\tOH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?\tPeter:\tWE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS FOR THE EXERCISE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO GET WHAT WE CAN. \nRoger:\tTHERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN... \nEven though he doesn't understand the plan, Roger helps Peter toss things into the barrow. \n258\tThey race down the hardware aisle tossing in tools and other supplies. Electrical cables, flashlights, batteries. They scoop things up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes in a store to grab whatever they can.259\tStephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps and\telectrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260\tAt the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey balcony, Zombies wander past as they head for the Store entrance where many creature still claw at the roll gate.261\tThe Zombies move randomly. Some are leaving the gate as their\tprey is now out of sight. They begin to wander here and there. \n262\tThree of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and start toward the offices. \n263\tStephen has found a large binder in the desk. It contains all the plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and many others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all the workings and layout of the huge structure.264\tElevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers appear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second storey aisles of the big store.265\tNow, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it ineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate. When the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are renewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266\tThey Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.\tThey run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than the moving steps, then they run across the first floor until they see the lower level-roll gate.267\tThere are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them\tare at the gate.\tPeter:\tLET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE! \nRoger:\tCAN'T TELL. \nPeter:\tCOME ON. OPEN UP. \nRoger :\t MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'... \nPeter:\tOPEN UP. I CAN GET THE WAGON OVER. IF IT IS FLYBOY, LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE. \nRoger moves to the second lock. More gunfire. \nPeter:\t(setting his weapon on the floor) YOU JUST COVER ME GOOD, YOU HEAR? \nRoger moves to the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to the handles of the barrow. \n301\tThe body of a dead Zombie hits the floor, its head shot through. Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break into the Maintenance Office. \nThe third staggers into the room. Stephen stands fast now. He holds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward the gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast tears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim accurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's neck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the gun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The Zombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the cabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but doesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the tool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite it. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor. The creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like an animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow squarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again and from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an uppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough for Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it. \n302\tThe second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and Peter runs out of the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies. \n303\tThe action attracts the attention of several of the creatures which are still wandering the balcony. They turn slowly. \n304\tJust as he rounds the corner. Peter almost collides with one creature, and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow. He manages to get past, and he runs as fast as he can toward the opening of the Administrative corridor. \n305\tRoger does not let the gate roll up too high. He stabilises the metal grid well within reach, then he stands his post with Peter's rifle. Several creatures approach from the opposite direction. Roger fires at the closest one. It falls. The others are still too far away to waste bullets. \n306\tStephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the maintenance manual. He rushes into the corridor and runs out. \n307\tThree more creatures move toward him up the hallway. \n308\tAt first Stephen freezes, then he starts backing toward the firestair, his rifle poised. \n309\tJust as Peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor, a Zombie\tsteps out of the hallway into his path. Peter slams the barrow squarely into the creature's legs. The Zombie falls in the barrow onto the supplies. The big man slams the load against a wall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its balance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's jacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out against the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail, but does not fall. Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up quickly behind and flips it over the rail. The creature makes no sound as it plummets to the concourse below.310\tRoger fires again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near. Other\tcreatures throughout the area are again converging on the Department Store entrance.311\tPeter wheels the barrow into the corridor and sees Steve at the\tother end, the three Zombies are still closing in.\tPeter:\tHOLD IT FLYBOY!312\tSteve freezes. He can barely see Peter, his vision blocked by the Zombies. The creatures are about thirty feet away.313\tPeter:\tDON'T GO INTO THE STAIRWAY!314\tStephen is confused. The creatures advance.315\tPeter:\tDON'T OPEN THAT DOOR, BABY. YOU'LL LEAD 'EM RIGHT UP WITH YOU. \n316\tSteve is on the verge of panic. \nPeter:\tRUN FOR IT.  RUN THIS WAY. The Zombies are drawing closer and closer.317\tPeter:\tCOME ON, MAN. RUN THIS WAY. YOU CAN RUN RIGHT THROUGH 'EM. WE GOTTA LEAD 'EM AWAY FROM HERE! \n318\tSteve sizes up the corridor. It is narrow, but there is room to run past the Zombies. \n319\tPeter:\tCOME ON, FLYBOY. YOU CAN MAKE IT. COME ON! \n320\tWith a sudden move, Steve breaks into a run. He passes the first\tcreature easily. The second grabs him as he runs past, but the man keeps his footing even though he slams against the wall. He keeps moving forward. The third creatures stands in his path. Steve lowers his head and slams into the Zombie's chest. The creature flies back and falls. Steve falls and tumbles toward the mouth of the passageway. He regains his footing as the creatures turn to pursue him, he runs to the end of the hall where Peter waits.\tPeter:\tNOW...HEAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT STORE...GO!321\tThe two men run across the balcony. They slam into two other\tZombies which clutch and grab at them without success. \n322\tAt the entrance arch to the store, Roger fires at another creature. It falls. Other Zombies are approaching, but Steve and Peter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the gate without a problem. \nThe Zombies converge on the area as they did before, clutching and pushing at the metal cage, which holds them out securely. \nThe men breathe heavily as they back away from the gate. \nPeter:\tDOWNSTAIRS AGAIN ...SAME TRICK. \n323\tThe men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing down the escalator. \n324\tOn the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they pull up wheezing with exhaustion. \nSteve:\tWHAT DO WE DO... \nRoger:\tLET 'EM KNOW WE'RE HERE... (shouting) WHOOOO HOOOOOO...OVER HERE...YEEE HAAAAAAAA.\tSteve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation. Peter smiles at the young pilot. \nPeter:\tYOU DID ALRIGHT THIS TIME FLYBOY. HOW 'BOUT IT? \nStephen laughs some more, nervously at first, then whole- Heartedly. Then he lets out a loud: \nSteve:\tWHOOOOOOOOOOOPEEEEEEEEE... \nHe has joined the cowboys. He is like a child, almost exultant with the joy of their victory... The three men shout through the cage at the creatures, which are\talready gathering at the gate. \n325\tOut on the concourse, a few Zombies wander aimlessly, but most are heading for the commotion on the first floor arch. \n326\tOn the upstairs balcony, Zombies again move toward the stationary steps and the escalators. \n327\tThe three creatures in the Administration corridor move toward the open mall. Two walk out on the balcony, but the last one turns into an open office. Then it staggers back out and heads down the hall toward the firestair. \n328\tFran can faintly hear the \"whooping\" of the men as she moves toward the stairway door, which is still open.329\tShe steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness. The\tshouting stops. Desperate with fear, she moves back to the storage room, then back onto the landing. Now her fear turns into anger.\tFran:\tSHIT...\tShe takes a few steps down the stairs. Stops. Goes back up. Fran:\tGOD DAMMIT! She starts back down again. \n330\tIn the corridor below, the creature walks into another office. Then it moves back into the hall. \n331\tThe Zombies crash against the first floor gate. It holds. The men crouch in the shadows of the gate. \nRoger:\tWE JUST GOTTA WAIT LONGER BEFORE WE MOVE. \nPeter:\tNO. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SOME OF THEM STAYIN' UP ON THE BALCONY. \nPeter:\tJUST DROP, I GOT YOU... \nSteve:\tI CAN'T...I... \nPeter:\t(to Roger) THE DESK...GIMME A HAND. \nThe two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the President's corpse. The action causes the chair to spin slightly and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action. \nThe desk in place. Steve's toes can reach its surface. He loses his balance slightly and pulls back up. He kicks a picture frame off the desk onto the floor, shattering the glass over photos of the President's wife and children. \nPeter:\tCOME ON! \nSteve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself down. He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk. \n362\tPeter is already unlocking the door to the corridor. He opens it a crack and peeks out. \n363\tThe corridor is empty. He sees the door at the end which leads to the exterior corridor. \n364\tAs the other men come up behind, Peter opens the door quietly and slips into the hall. He starts to walk quickly toward the door to the exterior corridor. Roger follows as Stephen moves backwards toward the fire stairs. \n365\tPeter's hands grab the barrow and pulls the cart down the corridor backwards so as to face the mall opening. \n366\tIn the corridor, Steve clutches the maintenance manual. Peter backs slowly up the hall. The wheels squeak and the big man bites his lip. Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall. Steve notices that the fire stairs door is open wide. \nSteve:\tJESUS CHRIST! \nHe bounds towards the door. Roger spins to see what happened. Peter turns and quickens his pace. Steve trots up the steps. \nRoger:\t(to Peter) COME ON...YOU GOT IT. \nPeter runs with the cart the last few yards. As he gets to the doorway, Roger breaks up the steps. \n368\tSteve breaks into the storage area...he drops the manual... \nSteve:\tFRANNIE! \n369\tThe woman turns in Steve's direction. The Zombie swats the flare out of Fran's hand. She startles and the cartons feel as though they will topple. She steadies herself with both hands. The creature is grabbing at her legs. She kicks. \n370\tSteve raises his rifle and moves in for a close shot. \nRoger:\tDON'T SHOOT...THEY'LL HEAR YA... \nRoger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid. \n371\tThe creature is still clutching at Fran. She kicks violently as Roger pulls the back of the Zombie's clothing. The Zombie falls and hits the floor. As it kneels up, Steve swings the butt of his rifle and smashes it into the thing's head. Then Roger delivers a blow with his gun, straight down. \n372\tSteve rushes to Fran. She falls off the cartons into his arms sobbing and choking. \nSteve:\tFRANNIE...ARE YOU ALRIGHT? YOU OK, FRANNIE? HEY... \nThe woman is incoherent. She is clutching at her stomach. \n373\tPeter appears in the doorway carrying the TV and several other items. He dumps them on the floor. \nPeter:\tLET'S GET THIS STUFF UP, COME ON. \n374\tRoger is dragging the dead Zombie to the door. Peter comes to help and Fran starts to wretch. Steve tries to calm her. He gets some water in a can and brings it over. \nSteve:\tFRANNIE...IT'S OK...COME ON, IT'S OK...ARE YOU HURT, HUN? DID YA HURT YOURSELF? FRANNIE... \n375\tDownstairs, at the exterior corridor, Peter peeks out. He can see the mall at the far end. The coast is clear. He and Roger hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the floor and retreat back into the fire stairs. Peter holds open the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment. Convinced they've not been seen, he closes the door. \n376\tPeter:\tI THINK WE'RE OK, BROTHER. \nThey grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs. \n377\tSteve still tries to comfort Fran. \nSteve:\tWE'RE OK...WE'RE ALL OK...WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF...ALL KINDS OF STUFF... \nIn the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies into the big room and deposit them near the TV. Then they go downstairs for another load. \nSteve:\tTHIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE...FRANNIE. THIS PLACE IS PERFECT. WE GOT IT MADE IN HERE...FRANNIE. \nThe woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching. \n378\tNow, the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against the door again. It is quiet except for the little noises of eating and occasional rustle of paper. We also head a faint electronic whistle, but we do not recognise it. \nAs we see more of the room, we find our refugees sitting near the reconstructed pyramid on the floor. Peter seems to be asleep up against the pyramid. Roger is nibbling at delicacies from the Department Store's Gourmet department. \nTheir \"loot\" is laid around them on the floor. Roger, as he eats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. There is a stack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still boxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small cassettes. There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards with a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all functional. Some are representative of the luxuries considered necessary by a consumer society. \nThey are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which Stephen tries to tune in. Its power cable is spliced into the leads of a bare light fixture overhead. Fran cannot be seen at first. \n383\tFran ducks back onto her blanket. She disgustedly lights another cigarette. Steve sits next to her again. \nSteve:\tFRANNIE... \nShe doesn't respond. \nSteve:\tDAMMIT, FRAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'D HAVE TO LAND FOR FUEL TRYIN' TO MAKE IT UP NORTH? THOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE EVERYWHERE. AND THE AUTHORITIES WOULD GIVE US JUST AS HARD A TIME... MAYBE WORSE... WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE, FRANNIE. WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED RIGHT HERE! \nStephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket. \nSteve:\tCOME ON...GET SOME SLEEP. \nThe woman doesn't move. \nSteve:\tFRANNIE. COME ON. \nShe grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and stretches out next to the man. He puts his arm around her. His hands rub up and down her body as he curls next to her. He opens her blouse and reaches inside. He closes his eyes and he seems perfectly comfortable to rest in her softness. His hand moves under her clothing. She doesn't respond, at first, then her body relaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his head. \nSteve:\tI'M NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN. I REALLY THINK THIS IS BETTER. HELL. YOU'RE THE ONE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO SET UP HOUSE. \nShe stares off across the barren room. His hands continues to move under her blouse. \n384\tIn the Administration Corridor, a few stray Zombies wander among the corpses on the floor. One large and severely wounded creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor. It had been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs. \nA female Zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall. She lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth, but she drops it quickly, repelled by its coldness. She leans over and picks at another corpse, then she stands and drifts towards the mall. \nSlowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the second floor balcony. We begin to hear a voice fading in over the scene. \nVoice:\t...NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISM...CANNIBALISM IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD, IMPLIES AN INTRASPECIE ACTIVITY... THESE CREATURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED HUMAN..THEY PREY ON HUMANS...THEY DO NOT PREY ON EACH OTHER. \n385\tWe see the mall balcony now. Zombies wander past the stores. Some move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse. Below. \nVoice:\tTHEY ATTACK AND...AND FEED...ONLY ON WARM HUMAN FLESH... \n386\tAt the mall entrances, some creatures drift out into the night. Others still enter the enormous building. There are not as many as there were in the afternoon, but there are certainly enough to be threatening. \nVoice:\tINTELLIGENCE? SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING POWER. WHAT BASIC SKILLS REMAIN ARE MORE REMEMBERED BEHAVIOURS FROM...FROM NORMAL LIFE. \n387\tSeveral creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department store. It is a strange and eerie sight. The staring, painted eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the Zombies. The gate rattles but does not budge. \nVoice:\tTHERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS, BUT EVEN THESE ACTIONS ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE... THE USE OF EXTERNAL ARTICLES AS BLUDGEONS ETC., EVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN THIS MANNER. \n388\tFran's eyes pop open the voice has awakened her. She has been asleep on the blanket. \nVoice:\tTHESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED INSTINCT... \nThe woman looks around. Morning sunlight is spilling in through the skylights above. She sits up and peers into the next area of the room. The men are gone. The television is playing. On the tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room reading the report. \n389\tVoice:\tTHEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS THEM. WE MUST NOT BE LULLED BY THE CONCEPT THAT THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR FRIENDS. THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO SUCH EMOTIONS. THEY MUST BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT.... \n390\tFran sees that the barricade of cartons is still in place at the fire stairs door. She looks up. The skylight above the pyramid is open. She realises that the men are on the roof. \n391\tAt the edge of the roof, Peter looks through binoculars. \n392\tAbout a quarter of a mile away, he sees the large warehouse of a food processing chain. IN the yard and in the large open garages of the building, he sees a fleet on enormous trailer- trucks parked. \n393\tSteve:\tYOU SURE WE CAN START 'EM. \nRoger:\tYOU HAVEN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE STREET. \nPeter:\tWELL LET'S GET IT UP. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF 'EM AROUND YET THIS MORNIN'. \nThe big trooper looks down to the parking lot below. \n394\tThere are not as many Zombies as there were the day before, and they wander aimlessly, spread out rather than in clusters. \n395\tThe men move for the skylight. \n396\tIn the storage area below, Fran is examining the maps in the manual. The TV still drones in a low volume. The men climb down into the room. \nRoger:\tHEY, FRAN... \nFran:\tI WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST, BUT I DON'T HAVE MY POTS AND PANS. \nThere is a bitterness in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses the tension. Peter just straps on his equipment. \nFran:\tCAN I SAY SOMETHING? \nSteve:\tSURE. WHAT DP YOU MEAN? \nFran:\tI'M SORRY YOU FOUND OUT I'M PREGNANT, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU'D TREAT ANOTHER GUY. \nSteve:\tHEY, FRANNIE, COME ON... \n403\tOn the roof of the mall, Fran clutches her rifle. She sees the big trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above them. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the trucks as closely as it can. \n404\tAlong the road, several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The creatures lumber along slowly behind. \n405\tThe vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the mall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building. \n406\tAt one of the building entrances, a cluster of Zombies is moving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the parking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the creatures turn and face the trucks. \nAs Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance doors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with a great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast of the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other flying back. \n407\tThe trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall entrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass doors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough for the creatures to get out. \n408\tThe few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering at its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as other Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab. \n409\tOverhead, the whirlybird hovers very close by. Now Peter's big truck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is directly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab. \nPeter's truck also crushes one or two of the creatures, but there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab. \n410\tAs Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck, one of the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the lot. \n411\tThe helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of the big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the action. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind from the chopper whipping her hair. \n412\tThe chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under it, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse down the road. \n413\tRoger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig pulls up beside another of the parked vans. \nPeter:\tCOME ON, COME ON... THREE MORE BABY. \nRoger:\tLIKE A CHARM, HUH? LIKE A FUCKING CHARM! \nRoger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables. \n414\tFrom the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving around the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a better look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out of the big garage directly toward Roger's truck. \n415\tIn the meantime, Peter's truck pulls away from the cab Roger is in. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the warehouse where Peter can turn it around easily. \n416\tStephen swoops down with the big bird. He buzzes as close as he can to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man. \n417\tRoger continues to work on the cables, still whooping like a child. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just about reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't notice. \n418\tPeter has now backed up into a position which enables him to pull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight for him. \n419\tThe big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around heading back for Roger. \n420\tPeter looks toward the other truck. He can now see the lumbering creatures. He tries to slam the truck into gear, but the complicated shift mechanism fights him. \n421\tOne Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of Roger's truck. The man startles and tries to untangle himself from his cramped position under the big steering wheel. He is stuck for a moment. The other creatures appear at the passenger side of the cab, where the door is open. One grabs at Roger's legs. Roger kicks violently, but can't get a good position. He falls lower onto the floor of the cab, his body almost knotted among the controls and the shift sticks. \n422\tPeter's truck starts to roll, but it accelerates slowly. \n423\tThe helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls, but they do not even flinch. The wind from the propeller blades whip at the creatures' hair, making them look even more frightening as they claw at the desperate Roger. \n424\tThe man kicks and kicks, but he cannot deliver a solid blow from his pinned position. His hand gropes on the seat of the truck for his rifle, which suddenly fires as the man's fingers inadvertently hit the trigger. A shell blasts through the chest of the lead creature, but the thing pays little attention. \n425\tPeter's truck is starting to roll faster. He heads right for Roger's cab. \n426\tThe helicopter hovers as Stephen tries to see the action. \n427\tNow Roger has a good grip on his gun, but he cannot clear the long weapon from around the gear sticks. The lead Zombie is actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the struggling Trooper. \n428\tThe second creature is about to claw its way in when, with a great roar, Peter's truck swings up and crushes it. \n429\tRoger is desperately trying to keep the other Zombie's mouth away. They are wrestling now. The Zombie is weak, as usual, but Roger is still hampered by the position he is in. \n430\tPeter has pulled too far past the other truck. He slams his rig into reverse and backs up. Now his window is in a direct line with the open door on Roger's cab. He raises his rifle and aims, but he cannot get a clear shot. He shouts loudly trying to overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering helicopter. \nPeter:\tGET ITS HEAD UP...GET ITS HEAD UP... \n431\tRoger realises that Peter is outside. He struggles with the creature, dropping his gun. His hands manage to get a stranglehold on the creature's neck. He pushes up with all his might. The Zombie's hands are clutching at the man's face. It's fingers push at the man's eyes. \n432\tPeter sees the opportunity and fires. The gun roars loudly. \n433\tThe Zombie's head flies apart. Remnants of blood and brain tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the driver's window. The gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp, but Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is now on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic. He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the creature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion. He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his face. He is quivering in extremes of emotions. \nA sudden crash. Roger spins. The Zombie at the driver door has smashed through the cab window with a brick. Roger, still shaking, dives down to the floor for his weapon. \n434\tPeter tries to level off a shot but he cannot because Roger is in the way... \nPeter:\tGET DOWN...STAY DOWN...I GOT IT! \n435\tRoger, in his adrenalised anger, sits up with his gun and levels off on the creature himself. He fires. The shell crashes through the already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures head. \nRoger:\tYOU BASTARDS...YOU BASTARDS... \n462\tIn Peter's truck, just rolling out the lot, Roger realises: \nRoger:\tJESUS! \nPeter:\tWHAT? \nRoger:\tMY GODDAM BAG...I LEFT MY GODDAM BAG IN THE OTHER TRUCK. \nPeter brings his vehicle to a screeching halt. \nPeter:\tALRIGHT, NOW YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU BETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD ON, BABY! \nRoger:\tYEAH, YEAH...I'M O.K. LET'S GO. \nSuddenly, Peter grabs the Trooper by his lapels and slams him back against the door of the cab. \nPeter:\tI MEAN IT! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYIN' WITH YOUR LIFE, YOUR PLAYIN' WITH MINE! \nThe two men stare at each other for a moment. Roger is startled somewhat out of his emotional rush. \nPeter:\t(softer) ALRIGHT, NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT? \nRoger:\tYEAH. \nPeter lets him go and returns to the wheel. He guns the engine and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot. \n463\tWhen Fran sees the truck returning, she looks up from her gun sight. The helicopter has already flown over the roof, and Stephen is confused as to why the truck hadn't appeared on the road. Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen. \n464\tHe finally sees her and flies closer. The woman waves a signal and the chopper buzzes back over the lot. \n465\tHer hair blowing wildly, Fran takes up her post again, her rifle ready. She thinks a moment, then begins to reload the weapon pulling the shells from her blouse pocket. \n466\tPeter's truck zooms back into position, colliding with some of Zombies in the vicinity. \n467\tRoger immediately climbs through the windows into the original cab. He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are strewn over the seat and floor. \nAgain, creatures converge on the cab area. Two more come up between the trucks, several come around the front of the cab. \n468\tFran is still loading. \n469\tThe helicopter buzzes. \n470\tAs Roger climbs back through the window, his pack accidentally falls to the ground. With reflex action, he drops between the cabs, landing on his feet. He is facing the two creatures which are very close. He reaches up and with on hand on each of the open window frames, he swings his legs up hard. His kick sends the creatures sprawling. Then, he bends to collect his pack and is grabbed from behind. \n471\tPeter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot. \n472\tNeither can Fran who is shouting from the roof. \n473\tRoger keeps his head this time. His first thought is for the pack of tools. He tosses the sack into the cab of Peter's truck as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball. \n474\tPeter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and onto the floor of the cab. \n475\tThe creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the man's imbalance from throwing the knapsack. It bites at the man's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound. Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw. The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies behind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's cab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally kicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the struggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of the door, but they slip. \n476\tPeter moves to drop his rifle and grab Roger's hands, but Roger falls from the high window back to the pavement. Peter draws his hand gun. \n477\tRoger leaps again, his hands catching the window frame. The Zombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and kicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm with his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs. \nPeter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot at one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able to pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the window when another creature grabs him. \n478\tPeter can no longer get a shot as Roger fills the window, so the big man drops his pistol and pulls Roger's arm with all his might. 479\tRoger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle, kicking. Peter starts the truck. As it begins to roll away, one of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's left leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf. Blood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op material from Roger's trousers. \n480\tRoger screams in pain and kicks violently. The truck accelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear. \n481\tIt rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops. Then it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important morsels. \nA bullet pings into the cement near the chewing Zombie. Another tears through its shoulder. It still is concerned only with its prize. \n482\tFran is firing, swearing through her teeth as the gun roars. She finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head. \n483\tWe see it fall from her point of view on the roof. Others walk by the corpse without taking notice. \n484\tThe helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse. \n485\tAs it rumbles along, Roger, in extreme pain, is tying his belt tightly around his leg as a tourniquet. He sucks air through his teeth in anguish. \nPeter:\tTHAT'S IT. \nRoger:\tBULL SHIT. \nPeter:\tWE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG! \nRoger:\tI'M DEALIN' WITH IT...I'M DEALIN' WITH IT FINE! I WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT. \nFran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him. Then Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of the advancing creatures reach the area. \n503\tAgain, the Zombies smash into the cage, but the humans are already running through the aisles of the big store. \n504\tPeter wheels Roger into the elevator and hits the button for the first floor. The doors shut and the car starts down. \nPeter:\tHOW'S THE RIDE? \nRoger:\tKIND BUMPY. WATCH IT. \nThe stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded man's head. Despite his attempt at humour, the stiffness in Roger's body evidences his pain. Peter puts his hand squarely on the Trooper's shoulder. \nPeter:\tLOOK HERE...I... \nRoger:\tI KNOW, I KNOW...SHUT UP. \nSomething very serious is shared between the two men, some knowledge which we do not fully understand. We do see the kind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle. \n505\tThe elevator doors glide open and Peter pushes the cart out into the first floor on the big store. \n506\tFran and Stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster than the steps themselves. \n507\tThey run through the hardware department where Stephen snatches up several propane torches. Fran stuffs extra bottles of gas into her back pack. \n508\tWith a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white-hot flame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter. Fran holds two torches as Stephen lights them. \n509\tPeter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with Roger in front of him. Several creatures outside of the cage fly into sudden frenzy at seeing the humans. They slam against the grid but it holds as usual. \nPeter:\tUNLOCK THE MIDDLE ONE LAST. \n510\tSteve falls on the right hand lock with his keys. The Zombies all converge near the crouching man's side of the gate. They push and shove. Fran holds one of the lit torches very close and the creatures back away cringing. The lock opens and Steve moves to the extreme left. \nAgain the Zombies follow and again Fran is ready with the torch. \nPeter:\tALRIGHT...THE TOUGHEST PART'LL BE GETTIN' BY THESE RIGHT HERE... \nSteve:\tIT'S A LONG HAUL DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE. \n511\tPeter cranes his neck to see past the Zombies and down the concourse. Several other creatures are starting toward the Department Store. Behind them, about three hundred feet away, is one of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a truck trailer. \n512\tPeter:\tWE'LL BE ALRIGHT! \nFran:\tIT'S TOO FAR! \nPeter:\tTHERE'S NO BACKIN' OUT NOW. WE GOTTA LOCK THOSE DOORS! \nFran:\tWE'LL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR. IT'S TOO RISKY. \nSteve:\tYOU JUST STAY HERE AND BE READY TO UPEN UP FOR US. \nFran:\tTHE CAR! \nPeter:\tWHAT? \nFran:\tTHE CAR! \n513\tOutside, we see the slowly spinning exhibit which displays the new automobile. It is a sleek, sporty model, which looks fast and manoeuvrable. \n514\tPeter looks down at Roger. \nPeter:\tYOU OK TO START IT? \nRoger nods and reaches for his supply pack. He is cringing with pain, but he moves efficiently. \n515\tThe Zombies clutch at the gate with new vigour. At the unlocked ends the grid gives a little, but still holds the creature out. Fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away. Steve un-locks the middle lock. \nSteve:\tIT'S GOIN' UP! \n516\tThe gate swings up with a thunderous roar. The Zombies attack but Fran's torches make them hold back slightly. Steve grabs one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol with the other. Fran draws a hand gun also. The two fire into the pack of Zombies. One or two fall. The others try to move in but are afraid of the bright flames. One gets close to Steve but the man blasts his torch directly into its face. Its hair catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about, knocking other Zombies back. \n517\tNow Peter sees an opening and he makes a break with the cart. Roger holds on to the sides. They crash through the scattered pack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car exhibit. There are a few creatures on the concourse on the cart's path. \nPeter:\t(shouting) CLOSE THE GATE...CLOSE THE GATE... \n518\tSteve grabs the lip of the roll cage and it starts down. Fran is still inside the store with one of the torches. \nFran:\tTHE KEYS, STEPHEN...THE KEYS! \nSteve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it slams shut with a metallic crash. \nFran:\tJESUS CHRIST! \n519\tPeter stops in his tracks when he hears the woman's shouts. He looks back. Several of the creatures have followed the cart. They advance slowly. \n579\tIn the vault, the big Trooper dumps bodies out on top of several others, already deposited. The corpses lie askew, their arms and legs protruding. The stacks of money are upset by the limp action of the bodies as they roll around. \n580\tA finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up slowly. \n581\tWe see a montage: Fran, Stephen and Peter walk slowly through the conquered building. They drift in and out of stores picking up various items. They use shopping carts. \n582\tFran rummages idly through the cosmetic department. \n583\tPeter looks through a book store. \n584\tStephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room. \n585\tPeter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror. \n586\tFran trims Stephen's hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of the mall Barber Shop. \n587\tFran feeds the animals in the Pet Store, then with a bag of seed, she feeds the Tropical Birds in the tall cage out on the concourse. The birds flutter, flap about, screeching loudly. \n588\tNow the group walk along the upper balcony. They look down. They still have their weapons and kits, Peter is wearing a wide brimmed hat and Fran sports a new mink coat. \n589\tThe concourse is empty now of corpses, but the group can hear the moaning and thumping at the main entrances. It is dark outside, the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in the shadows under the big trailer trucks. The sound evidences their presence, however. \n590\tThe people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their realm. \nFran:\tTHEY'RE STILL HERE. \nSteve:\tTHEY'RE AFTER US...THEY KNOW WE'RE IN HERE. \nPeter:\tTHEY'RE AFTER THE PLACE...THEY DON'T KNOW WHY...THEY JUST REMEMBER...REMEMBER THAT THEY WANNA BE IN HERE! \nThe noise at the entrance continues eerily. Fran starts to be afraid. \nFran:\tWHAT THE HELL ARE THEY? \nPeter:\tTHEY'RE US, THAT'S ALL. THERE'S NO MORE ROOM IN HELL. \nSteve:\tWHAT? \nPeter:\tSOMETHIN' MY GRANDADDY USED TO TELL US...YOU KNOW MACUMBA? VOODOO... GRANDADDY WAS A PRIEST IN TRINIDAD. USED TO TELL US...WHEN THERE'S NO MORE ROOM IN HELL...THE DEAD WILL WALK THE EARTH. \n591\tRoger is screaming wildly. He is sweating and his face looks sunken with an ashen colour. He thrashes about as Steve tries to hold him. His leg is swollen, almost all black. His arm, which was also bitten, is wrapped but oozing. \nSteve:\tGET MORE VALIUM IN HIM... \nFran fumbles with one of the hypodermics, but she drops the vial of serum and it shatters on the floor. \nSteve:\tGET ANOTHER ONE...COME ON... \nRoger is throwing himself about wildly. Steve barely manages to hold on. Fran rushes into the other room. \n592\tThe space is starting to look like living quarters. There is furniture. There are sectioned off areas with things still packed in cartons, but it is beginning to look like home. \n593\tThe woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more organised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator. She takes a new vial of serum from the freezer. \n594\tDownstairs, Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of the fake wall. He hears the violent screaming from above. \n595\tHe climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling, scrambles through the grill in the ceiling, enters the duct. Then he pulls up the ladder and closes the grill. \n596\tHe crawls through the tight space for a few feet, and drops out of another grill into the washroom. \n597\tHe moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair. \n598\tAll the while, Roger's screaming can be heard. Peter tramps up the stairs several at a time. \n599\tHe rushes through the living space in the direction of the screams. \n600\tFran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Roger's good arm. The man still thrashes wildly. Steve is struggling to hold him. Peter rushes in and helps. Fran drifts out of the room. \nAfter a short time Roger relaxes somewhat. \nPeter:\t(to Steve) GO ON...I'LL STAY WITH HIM. \nSteve leaves the area. \n601\tIn the living spaces, Fran is sitting in a chair. It is the inflatable kind, which can be collapsed like a balloon. Steve comes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind. She cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly. She stares off across the room. \n602\tRoger catches his breath and looks up at Peter. He licks his lips and tries to speak coherently. \nRoger:\tYOU...YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME, RIGHT, PETER? YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...WHEN I GO... \nPeter:\tI WILL. \nRoger:\tI DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND LIKE THAT PETER... NOT AFTER I GO...I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND LIKE THAT... \nFrom the movement beneath, the blanket starts to creep down off Roger's face. Peter stares with fascination and disbelief. The blanket clears the blankly staring eyes...the drooling mouth...Roger tries to sit up/ Peter's hands click a shell into his super-gun. \nSuddenly, the corpse sits up. It stares at Peter, blankly at first, then with purpose...it starts to move towards the Trooper who calmly raises his weapon... \n611\tOn the TV, the commotion still rages. Stephen and Fran stare at the tube, hardly believing what they see. The scientist is shouting above the din. He is nervous. He wipes his brow with his sleeve... \nScientist:   WE'VE GOT TO REMAIN UNEMOTIONAL...UNEMOTIONAL... RATIONAL...LOGICAL...TACTICAL! TACTICAL! \n612\tSteve:\tTHEY'RE CRAZY...THEY'RE CRAZY... \nFran:\tIT'S REALLY...ALL OVER, ISN'T IT... \nBLAM! The loud roar of Peter's gun from the next room. Fran startles and falls into Stephen's arms. \n613\tRoger's corpse is dumped on top of the stack of bodies in the Bank vault. His eyes stare with a puzzled expression. The arms and legs of the other bodies make the room look like a Renaissance Painting of hell itself. There is the familiar gunshot wound in Roger's forehead. \nThe heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which echoes through out the mall. \n614\tA small puppy lifts its leg and urinates on a table. \nFran:\tADAM! NO NO! \nThe woman's hands reach into frame and grab the little animal. She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid out in an unused part of the storage area. \nFran's stomach is big now, her pregnancy evident. She wipes her brow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the living area. She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress which she and Steve obviously share. There is an end table near the bed, with a reading light. Books lie strewn around, along with magazines and half drunk cups of coffee. \n615\tIn the sitting room, we see a scene which could be comfortable suburban. The furniture is neatly arranged. There is a small portable stove which operates on bottled gas, a refrigerator, and cabinets with dishes and silverware. \n616\tThere is a modern calendar on the wall, which has three months crossed off. There are a variety of radio and TV units and a stereo record player. There are even decorations: paintings hung, knick knacks on the tables. The room almost looks like a wealthy man's den, with all the gadget-oriented affluence. \n617\tIn the Department Store, Stephen wanders about. He fiddles with a new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games. \n618\tOn the roof, in the bright sun of early morning, Peter plays tennis against one of the shed walls. He's dressed in a new sweat suit with brightly coloured Addidas sneakers. He has a sleek new racquet, slamming phosphorescent balls with all his might. His face is set in what is almost anger. He attacks each shot with determination and emotion. \n619\tOne of his shots misses the shed. The ball bounces and banks off the lip of the roof, then it tumbles over the edge. \n620\tIn the parking lot below, the ball hits the pavement. It bounces several times, rolling off among the feet of the army of Zombies wandering this way and that through the area. \n621\tThe creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances. They moan and gurgle, clawing at the building. There seem to be hundreds of them, all different ages, sexes, shapes. Some clothed, some naked, some wounded, some almost untouched. \n622\tNow Fran, the pregnant housewife, is cooking supper. \n623\tThe men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living space. \n624\tThe three sit around the dinner table, just finishing their supper. The TV set is on, but only grey snow fills the screen and the speaker hisses as it receives no signal. \nFran:\tTHERE HASN'T BEEN A BROADCAST FOR THREE DAYS. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP? \nSteve:\tTHEY MIGHT COME BACK ON. \nFran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the TV. She clicks it off. The woman returns to the table. \nSteve stands up and moves to the set. He clicks it back on. Peter watches the two sheepishly. It is a domestic scene. The group has become a family, with all the disadvantages of comfortable living, including the inability to communicate. \nFran:\tWHAT HAVE WE DONE TO OURSELVES? \n625\tThe thunderous roar of the helicopter engine. The machine is hovering over the roof of the mall. \n626\tFran is at the controls. Steve sits in the passenger seat. \nSteve:\tOK, NOW EASY...EASY...BRING 'ER DOWN... \n627\tThe whirlybird starts down for the roof. It is somewhat unstable, but it eases down regularly. \n628\tIn the cockpit, a flustered Fran manages to handle the controls. \nSteve:\tEASY...STABILISE IT...THAT'S IT... \nThe woman reacts efficiently. She handles the controls better as The chopper's runners are just about on the roofs surface. \nSteve:\tTHAT'S IT...THAT'S IT...YOU GOT IT! \n629\tThe runners hit the roof surface and the chopper settles. \n630\tFran throws her arms impulsively around Stephen's neck. \nSteve:\tYOU DID IT...YOU DID IT, HON...YOU DID IT... \nThe woman excitedly hugs and kisses Stephen with childish joy. She is bubbling. \n631\tSeen from a great distance, the helicopter atop the mall looks very small. Its engine dies and begins to whine. \n632\tA pair of binoculars is watching the action. The lenses pull away from a pair of beady eyes. \nPeter:\tWELL LET'S NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR 'EM...COME ON! \n642\tThe men charge down through the skylight. The roar of the convoy can now be heard in the living space. \nFran is desperate. Steve rushes by her with Peter, who crashes on ahead through the door onto the firestairs. \nFran:\tWHAT'S HAPPENING? \nSteve:\tTHERE'S FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF 'EM... WE'RE GONNA SHUT OFF THE GATES. \nFran:\tSTEPHEN! \nSteve:\tWE'RE JUST GONNA SHUT THE GATES. THEY'LL NEVER FIND US UP HERE. \nThe man disappears through the stairway door. Fran drops the puppy which goes running after the men floppily. \nFran thinks to chase the dog, but instead moves to the storage area and snatches her weapons. She starts to load her rifle. \n643\tOutside, the convoy makes a pass at one of the trucks. In the darkness the Zombies clutch at the fast bikes. The raiders fire their guns, dropping several of the creatures. \nThe mob of creatures is impenetrable at first. The raiders leader signals the convoy to drop back across the parking lot. Some raiders have trouble keeping balance as Zombies claw them. \n644\tThe lead bikes pull up on the other side of the lot. \nRaider:\t THEY'LL SPREAD OUT COMIN' AFTER US... THEN WE GO IN WITH THE VAN... \n645\tThe other bikes ride to the leaders. A van pulls in and two bikers scramble aboard through the side doors. One of the women jumps into the driver's seat and revs the engine. \n646\tThe Zombies are starting to move out after the convoy. The mob at the mall entrance is thinning somewhat. \n647\tIn the mall, Peter drops from the grill in the exterior corridor. He charges out and into the Maintenance corridor, where he breaks for the mall proper. He is followed by Stephen. \nPeter:\t(shouting) DOWNSTAIRS FIRST... \nSteve:\tOK... \nPeter:\tGOT YOUR TALK BOX? \nSteve:\tYEAH. \nPeter:\tKEEP IS HANDY. \n648\tOutside, the Raiders' van revs and roars towards the mall. The bikers stay at the other side of the lot, engines idling. Some of them whoop and holler like American Indians. \n649\tThe van crashes through the advancing Zombies. Several of them are knocked flying. The vehicle pulls up to the truck cab. Three men pile out and scramble into the truck. The Zombies in the area clutch at the raiders, but they fight their way clear. The woman in the van revs the engine again. Zombies claw at her window. She squeals back to the main biker group. \n650\tThe Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of motorcycles from a good distance. The raiders open fire. They, too, possess sophisticated weapons, the barrage sets up a great noise. Several creatures fall. The little van pulls up behind the bikes. The men still whoop and shout. \n651\tOn the floor on the mall, Peter and Steve dash about slamming roll gates down on the open stores. They run desperately through the empty concourses. They hear the din from outside. \n652\tAt the trailer cab, a raider fires point blank at the Zombies that claw at the passenger window. Another man checks cables. \nRaider:\t SHIT...IT'S STILL TAPED UP...IT'S ALL READY FOR US... \nThe man sits at the wheel, revving the engine. Ghouls at windows. \n653\tInside, the men hear the truck starting. Steve slams down the Pharmacy gate. Peter is already running to the Department Store. The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second floor aisles. Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store. \n654\tThe huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance. A shout of victory goes up from the raiders. The Zombies at the door do not yet enter the mall, their focus on the raiders now. From other entrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot. \n655\tAcross the lot, the bikers rev their engines ready to make a run on the building. The raiders in the truck hop from the cab. They run to the doors, shooting Zombies at they move. Some creatures fall, others claw at the runners. One raider is brought down by the ghouls. His friends pay no attention. \n656\tOne gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked. He levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the mechanism. The men push through the doors. The little alarm units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal. \n657\tPeter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he hears the alarms go off. \n658\tOne of the raiders hears the gates rumbling. He looks up and sees Peter running by the railing upstairs. He fires with his machine gun. \n659\tPeter dives, sliding across the balcony. The bullets miss him and he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below. \n660\tSteve has just slammed down the Hardware Store gate, and makes a dash for the Department Store. \n661\tThe raiders spot him as well, and open fire. \n662\tSteve runs zip-zag and dives into the big store, where he ducks into the shadows leaving the gate open. \n663\tPeter, at the balcony railing, levels his super-gun on the bikers. \n664\tOne accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound in his chest. \n665\tThe last raider at the doors ducks out of Peter's sight. \n666\tSteve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store. \n703\tSeveral creatures now wander through the Department Store, having entered from the second storey gate. They move through aisles knocking against displays. One grabs a mannequin thinking it human, throws the dummy aside roughly. \n704\tThe raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies. He runs down the corridor to the Maintenance office. Peter is gone. Breaking into the various empty offices, the raider comes to the fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere. Then he hears the faint barking of the dog. He checks the panel again by running his hand along the edge. \nSuddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns. There are three ghouls coming. He fires and knocks off the ghouls one at a time and runs onto the balcony. \n705\tBikes roar this way and that. It is a war zone. \n706\tThe man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above. He spins and looks up. He sees Peter just too late. \n707\tThe big Trooper, in an open ceiling grid, aims his super-gun squarely at the raider's head. The gun roars and the man flies. \n708\tBelow, the raiders are starting to regroup. The bikes begin to peel out of the mall entrance one at a time. \n709\tAnother raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies. \n710\tThe bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman driver gets ready to pull out. She lowers her window and fires point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures. \n711\tThe last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance. The Zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside. The men shoot and beat their way to the cycles. One man is brought down, but three manage to mount their cycles. The big bikes roar out. \n712\tPeter is crawling through the ductwork. Just as he opens a grid, he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse. He levels off with his scope. \n713\tHe shoots one raider out of the saddle. Two others get out. \n714\tRegrouping in the lot, the band of twenty is now seven or eight. \n715\tOne last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the concourse. He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance. He is the leader. The one who was on the radio. He whoops victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors. \n716\tPeter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on the back of the riders head. He waits as the biker roars out onto the lot. The rider lets out one last victorious shout in the fresh air. Peter's scope is locked on the riders back and the super-gun roars. The biker is blown off his machine. \n717\tThe bike flies into a pack of Zombies. Some fall back, but others advance on the rider. The man rolls over the cement, stops, not dead yet. He screams wildly as they move onto him. \n718\tThe other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade away. \n719\tThe puppy stops barking. Fran is tense in the darkness clutching her rifle. She stands on the now silent landing. \n720\tIn the parking lot and main concourse the Zombies move freely. They fight over the remains of the corpses. They eat ravenously, the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area. \n721\tPeter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork. Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button. \nSteve:\tPETER! \nPeter:\tWHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? \nSteve:\tIN THE ELEVATOR! \nPeter:\tLISTEN, THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. CLIMB UP TOP...I'LL GET YOU OUT THE GRID ON THE SHAFT...I'M COMIN. \nPeter starts to crawl through the ducts. \n722\tSteve hits the second floor button and the car moves. He clamours up on the hand rail on the car. His hands reach up and grab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the opening. He kicks with his legs to force himself up when the car stops. He sees the grid in the shaft wall. \n723\tSuddenly, the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly several Zombies dart into the car. They claw at Steve's legs and pull him out of the hatch. He screams, thrashes violently. \n724\tIn the duct, Peter hears the screams. He stops and listens for a moment. He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor. \n725\tIn the elevator, Steve thrashes with all his might. The ghouls try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and close repeatedly against the creatures which block it. \nA Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck. The man scrambles to unholster his gun. Although he is bleeding profusely, he finally pulls his gun and fires...once...twice... \n726\tPeter is dropping out of the washroom duct. He hears the pistol shots and realises Steve is not dead. He thinks about climbing back in the grid, but stops. He punches at the wall violently. He is angry and confused. \n727\tAgain the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head, flying out of the elevator. The doors still slam against the last creature and Steve fires. The Zombie flies back and the doors finally close. \n728\tOutside, Zombies fall against the elevator doors. \n729\tInside, Steve falls to the floor. His neck runs red. His eyes are wide with terror. He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in his hand. He finds it hard to breathe. \n730\tPeter appears at the bottom of the firestair. The puppy runs to meet him, tails wagging and yapping. He hangs his head as Fran looks down. \nFran:\tNO.....NO! \nShe runs down the steps. The big Trooper catches her bodily as she is about to charge out into the hall. \nPeter:\tI HEARD HIS GUN...MAYBE HE'S ALRIGHT...WE'LL WAIT...WE'LL JUST WAIT A WHILE... \n731\tThe mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn. \n732\tZombies move through the building freely, walking the halls, lumbering through the stores. \n733\tSeveral creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors. As they push each other, one creature inadvertently makes contact with the elevator call button. \nThe doors glide open. Steve is standing, his blood dry now. His eyes are blank as he steps forward. The creatures step away seeing that he is no longer prey...he is among them now. \n", "test1_input": "19\t Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters argue. The commotion is maddening. Fran stares for a moment. \n20\t TV Man 2:    (now distraught...almost pleading) THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT. IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS... WITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE- ACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE BODY. \nAnother outburst in the studio. \nTV Man 2:    THE SITUATION MUST BE CONTROLLED...BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY... \n21\t Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and finally reaches another emergency radio installation. Skip and Dusty are trying to listen to their receivers. They jot notes. \nFran:\tOPERATIVE RESCUE STATIONS? \nDusty:\tTHEY'RE DROPPIN' LIKE FLIES. HERE'S A FEW. YOU KNOW, I THINK FOSTER'S RIGHT. I THINK WE'RE LOSIN' THIS WAR. \nFran:\tYEAH, BUT NOT TO THE ENEMY. WE'RE BLOWIN' IT OURSELVES. \nShe gives the rest of her coffee to the two men. \nFran:\tNOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL. \nThe two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup. Fran rushes off toward a large teleprompter typing machine. \n22\t The broadcasters still argue emotionally. \nTV Man 1:    PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR SOLUTIONS, DOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM. \nTV Man 2:    EVERY DEAD BODY THAT IS NOT EXTERMINATED BECOMES ONE OF THEM! IT GETS UP AND KILLS! THE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL! \n23\t Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter typist, Fran rushes back toward the control room. \n24\t Around the monitor consoles, the commotion has been made even more frantic by an angered Dan Givens, obviously one of the station managers. \nGivens:\t NOBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT, I WANT... \nGivens spots Fran as she moves into the room. \nGivens:\t GARRET, WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS? \nFran:\tNOBODY. I KILLED 'EM. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE. \nGivens:\t I WANT THOSE SUPERS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME. \nFran:\tARE YOU WILLING TO MURDER PEOPLE BY SENDING THEM OUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN? \nGivens:\t WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY MINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT. \nFran stares at the red faced man in disbelief. \nGivens:\t I WANT THAT LIST UP ON THE SCREEN EVERY MINUTE THAT WE'RE ON THE AIR. \nFran is about to say something in anger, but before she can, one of the technicians, having overheard Givens, gets up from the control panel and starts to walk away. \nGivens:\t LUCAS...LUCAS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING... GET ON THAT CONSOLE...LUCAS...WE'RE ON THE AIR! \nLucas:\tANYBODY NEED A RIDE! \n25\t Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up personal effects and follow the technician toward the door. The door is guarded by a nervous Officer. \n26\t Givens:\t OFFICER...OFFICER...YOU STOP THEM...STOP THOSE MEN...LUCAS...GET BACK ON THIS CONSOLE... \nA frantic hubbub begins over the lack of console control. People rush in and out, the floor director's voice can be heard over a talk back system... \nVoices:\t WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON IN THERE. SWITCH...SWITCH...THERE'S NO SWITCHER... WE'RE LOSING PICTURE... \nGivens:\t OFFICER...STOP THOSE MEN... 27\t The young officer faces the men as they reach his post. He takes a grip on his rifles, opens the door and lets the group through. Then he runs out himself, deserting the losing cause. \n28\t Givens jumps toward the console. He frantically tries to work the complex dials and pots... \nGivens:\t GET SOMEBODY IN HERE THAT KNOWS HOW TO RUN THIS THING...COME ON...I'LL TRIPLE THE MONEY FOR THE MAN THAT CAN RUN THIS THING...TRIPLE THE MONEY...WE'RE STAYING ON THE AIR... \nFran moves slowly off toward the studio. \n29\t In the big room, the tension is thicker than ever. A few of the newsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions, but most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over the broadcast which still rages. \n30\t TV Man 2:    THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON. THEY KILL FOR FOOD. THEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, MR. BERMAN. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING. \n31\t Fran stops to listen to the argument. She falls back into the shadows of the studio. People rush past her, some leaving the studio in disgust. \n32\t TV Man 2:    IF WE'D LISTENED...IF WE'D DEALT WITH THE PHENOMENON PROPERLY...WITHOUT EMOTION... WITHOUT...EMOTION... IT WOULDN'T HAVE COME TO THIS! \nFoster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief. He pulls his tie away from his tight collar, and pops the shirt button open. He is desperate now, shivering with anger and frustration. \nTV Man 2:    THERE IS A MARTIAL LAW STATE IN EFFECT IN PHILADELPHIA...AS IN ALL OTHER MAJOR CITIES IN THE COUNTRY... CITIZENS MUST UNDERSTAND THE...DIRE...DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON...SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CHECK THE SPREAD... BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES..OF THE CITIZENRY...TOWARD...THESE ISSUES OF... MORALITY... IT IS THE ORDER OF THE O.E.P.

A few others jump in to take their places, but pandemonium reigns. A cameraman whips off his headset and breaks for the door. His camera spins on its liquid head, and on the monitors, we see a whirling blur as Foster continues to speak. \nFran moves quickly for the spinning camera. She aims it back at the sweating Foster, and she stares through the viewfinder not believing what she is seeing. \n34\t TV Man 2:    THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WILL BE DELIVERED OVER TO SPECIALLY EQUIPPED SQUADS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD FOR ORGANISED DISPOSITION... \n35\t Suddenly a man darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up quickly behind Fran. \nSteve:\tFRANNIE...AT NINE O'CLOCK MEET ME ON THE ROOF. WE'RE GETTING OUT. \nFran:\t(letting the camera slip slightly) STEPHEN...I DON'T BELIEVE THIS...WHAT... \nSteve:\tWE'RE GETTING OUT. IN THE CHOPPER. \nAnother technician steps over to take the camera from Fran. Stephen talks more quietly in the other man's presence. \nSteve:\tNINE P.M. ALRIGHT? \nFran:\tSTEVE...WE CAN'T...WE'VE GOT TO... \nSteve:\tWE'VE GOT TO NOTHING, FRAN. WE'VE GOT TO SURVIVE. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SURVIVE. NOW YOU COULD BE UP THERE AT NINE. DON'T MAKE ME COME LOOKIN' FOR YA. \nStephen is gone in a flash. Fran nervously looks back at the cameraman. The argument still rages between Foster and Berman. The cameraman, without taking his eye from the viewfinder, speaks to Francine quietly and slowly. \nCameraman:   GO AHEAD. WE'LL BE OFF THE AIR BY MIDNIGHT ANYWAY. EMERGENCY NETWORKS ARE TAKING OVER. OUR RESPONSIBILITY... IS FINISHED, I'M AFRAID. \n36\t It is dusk, and the city of Philadelphia is surprisingly quiet. We see several large buildings. They are part of a low-income housing project, and their lack of grace is evident. They stand like tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky. \n37\t Under cover of the growing darkness, activities of the S.W.A.T. Unit go unnoticed. Grappling hooks grab against the lip around the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building. Men in armour vests, clutching the latest in special weapons, take position here and there about the development. \nOther men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court below. \n38\t On the roof, at an entrance to one of the building's fire stairs, Roger squats silently alongside three other team members. The men check their weapons. Roger looks at his watch. The sweep hand reaches the 12... \nRoger:\t(to himself) LIGHTS. \n39\t In an instant, large searchlights bathe the side of the building. The troop commander, shielded with other Officers behind a large truck, shouts through an electric bullhorn. \nCommander:   MARTINEZ...YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING...YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED... \nThe electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete caverns between the buildings of the project. There are only a few windows which glow with lights from inside. At the sound of the bullhorn, the lights all blink out one at a time. \nCommander:   (not over the bullhorn) LITTLE BASTARD'S GOT 'EM ALL MOVED INTO ONE BUILDING...DUMB LITTLE BASTARD! \nSergeant:    LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO FIGHT US. \nCommander:   (on the bullhorn again) MARTINEZ...THE PEOPLE IN THIS PROJECT ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY...WE DON'T WANT ANY OF THEM HURT AND NEITHER DO YOU! \n42\t There is no sign of life in the building. The great concrete slab is silhouetted silently against the darkening sky. \n43\t Roger, and his team mates, crouch in readiness. The sound of the bullhorn rises to them easily and clearly. \nRoger:\tI'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ... \nCommander:   (Bullhorn) I'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ... TURN OVER YOUR WEAPONS AND SURRENDER... \nRoger:\tTHERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU... \nCommander:   THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU OR ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE... \nRoger:\tYET. \nCommander:   THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ. \nRoger:\tAND COUNTING. (he looks at his watch) \nThere is a long silence. \nRoger:\tCOME ON, MARTINEZ! \nOne of the other S.W.A.T. team members is a big man, with a rough and vicious looking face. He is WOOLEY, a hardened veteran, and a red neck of the first order. \nWooley:\t YEAH, COME ON, MARTINEZ...SHOW YOUR GREASY LITTLE PUERTO RICAN ASS...SO I CAN BLOW IT OFF... \nRoger looks over at the big man. He is distressed at the pent up violence in Wooley. \nWooley:\t I'LL BLOW ALL THEIR ASSES OFF...LOW LIFE BASTARDS.. BLOW ALL THEIR LITTLE LOW LIFE PUERTO RICAN AND NIGGER ASSES RIGHT OFF... \nRoger is greatly concerned. He looks at one of the other men, a young, smoothed faced rookie. The boy doesn't know now to react. He is obviously nervous. \n", "test1_id": 75, "test2_input": "Steve:\tWHERE YA HEADED? \nOfficer 2:   DOWN RIVER...GOT AN IDEA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT TO THE ISLANDS. \nSteve:\tWHAT ISLANDS? (he starts the engine) \nOfficer 2:   ANY ISLANDS...WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHERE YOU HEADED? \nSteve:\tSTRAIGHT UP. \n106\tThe Policeman rushes off with his two cohorts. As they untie one of the launches from the dock, the J.A.S. helicopter whines loudly. Then it lifts off the dock with a smooth motion. \nThe Police launch starts without a problem, and it pulls out onto the dark river. \n107\tThe lights on the helicopter blink as the metal bird swoops low over the Philadelphia skyline. We see an empty city. Independence Hall...Betsy Ross' House, which flies the original American flag...the oldest American heritages stand coldly in the night. The whirring engine fades overhead. \n108\tIn the cockpit, Fran lights a cigarette. So does Roger. No one comments, but Peter smiles slightly. \nThe big Black looks down at the city. \nPeter:\tANY OF YOU LEAVIN' PEOPLE BEHIND? \nFran:\tAN EX-HUSBAND. \nRoger:\tAN EX-WIFE. \nSteve:\tYOU PETER? \nPeter:\t(still looking down) SOME BROTHERS. \n109\tThe whirlybird cuts through the dark night sky. It flies over open country now, moving West. Some time has passed. \n110\tRoger is asleep in the passenger seat. Twisted in the cramped rear of the cockpit, Fran and Peter sit very close to each other. Peter still stares off into the night. \nFran:\tREAL BROTHERS? \nPeter looks at her. He has a strong face. \nFran:\tREAL BROTHERS OR...STREET BROTHERS? \nPeter:\tBOTH. \nFran:\tHOW MANY REAL ONES? \nPeter:\tTWO. \nFran:\tTWO. \nPeter:\tONE'S IN JAIL. THE OTHER'S A PRO BALL PLAYER. BUT WE CATCH UP TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE. \nFran doesn't quite know how to respond. \nPeter:\t(nodding at Steve...the engine roars too loudly for the pilot to hear the conversation) HE YOUR MAN NOW? \nFran is taken off guard. She smiles slightly. \nFran:\tMOST OF THE TIME, YEAH. \nPeter:\tJUST LIKE TO KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS. \nFran:\tYEAH. ME TOO. \n111\tLight downs on the horizon. The little helicopter chugs through the shades of blue. \n112\tNow Fran is asleep and Roger still snores. Peter stares at the back of the pilot's head. Steve nods slightly, then shakes himself. Soon, he nods again...falling asleep. Peter kicks him in the shoulder. \nSteve looks back, surprised that the big man is awake. Peter just stares at him. \nSteve rubs his face violently with his free hand. He pulls at his lower eyelids. \nSteve:\tANY MORE WATER? \nPeter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic container with water. Steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his face. Then he passes it back to Peter, who also drinks. \nSuddenly, Fran stiffens and wakes up with a start. Peter looks over at her with a gentle expression. She takes a moment to orient herself. \nPeter:\t(to Stephen) YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE? \nSteve:\tI KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE. \nPeter:\tHARRISBURG? \nSteve:\tPASSED IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. \n", "test2_true": "Steve:\tWE'RE PRETTY LOW ON FUEL. I'M JUST WAITIN' FOR FULL LIGHT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE LANDIN' IN. \n113\tIn the morning light, several fires can be seen on the ground, where buildings are burning. \n114\tThe chopper flies over a National Guard convoy as it chugs up a winding country road. \n115\tHere and there on the ground, human activity can be seen. Search and Destroy units, made up of Police, Guardsmen and civilian volunteers move across the country side. Occasionally, a Zombie is seen staggering through the trees or over a field. Gunfire cuts the creature down. \n116\tRoger:\tJESUS. IT'S EVERYWHERE. \nSteve:\tWE'RE STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO JOHNSTOWN. WE'RE BETTER OFF AWAY FROM THE BIG CITIES. \n117\tA little country airfield lies quiet in the morning sun. There is no sign of life. A few private planes dot the area, but the tower is empty. The J.A.S. chopper buzzes very low just outside the tower windows. \n118\tAs the whirlybird slowly sets down near the fuel pumps, its blades create a wind blast which raises great clouds of dust from the dry earth. Sheets of old newspaper and other light debris are sent flying through the air in all directions. \n119\tOne piece of torn newsprint blows flat against a window in one of the little sheds.  It sticks against the glass for a moment, as though glued there, then it flutters to the ground. As the paper clears the glass, we see the face of a badly scarred Zombie peering out through the window. \n120\tAs the group scrambles out of the helicopter, Stephen immediately checks the fuel pumps. \nSteve:\tSHIT, MAN, DAMN NEAR EMPTY. \nRoger:\tLOTTA PRIVATE PLANES IN FARM COUNTRY LIKE THIS. GUESS THEY ALL HIT THE PUMPS AND TOOK OFF. \nSteve:\tTO WHERE? WHERE THE HELL CAN THEY GO? \nPeter:\tWHERE WE GOIN? \nBy now, Steve has drained the dregs from the first pump into the chopper's tank, and moved to the second pump. It spurts with more force. \nSteve:\tTHERE'S A GOOD BIT LEFT IN THIS PUMP. \nHe stretches the hose toward the chopper but it doesn't quite reach. \nSteve:\tDAMN. I GOTTA GET IT CLOSER. \n121\tSteve jumps back into the cockpit and the machine lifts off the ground. \n122\tFran is watching the action, walking slowly backwards to a small rickety hangar area. She turns and looks down to the private hangars. Most of them are open wide, the planes they housed long gone. One or two of the old wooden double-doors are still closed and locked with chains and padlocks. The wind from the chopper blades blows her hair and sends more debris flying. \n123\tPeter kicks open the door to the chart house. The room is dusty and dilapidated. A few small chairs surround an old wooden table. Several half finished cups of coffee sit on top of wrinkled flight charts leaving brown rings on the paper. Flies buzz loudly. An old window shade clicks against its window from the gusting of the wind and it makes Peter flinch. \nHe readies his weapon. When he sees the shade, he steps over to it easily, pulls it and lets it roll up on itself. It makes a loud, flapping noise. \n124\tOutside, the chopper sets down. Roger is ready with the hose nozzle. Ducking under the blades he inserts the device into the tank receptacle even before Stephen has idled the engine. \nStephen hops out of the cockpit and shouts over the engine noise. \nSteve:\tI'M GONNA SEE WHAT'S LEFT IN THE HANGARS. \nHe trots off after Fran. \n125\tIn the chart house, Peter idly drops a coin into an old coffee machine at one end of the room.  The machine clicks loudly and spits out a cup. To Peter's surprise, the cup starts to fill with hot brown liquid. \nWhile he waits. Peter notices a series of notes taped to the machine and the surrounding walls. They are all written hurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and colours. \nLUCY - GONE TO JOHNSTOWN. CHARLES - I HAVE THE KIDS. LEFT WITH BEN. COULDN'T WAIT. GONE TO ERIE - JACK FOSTER. \nThere are dozens of such messages. Peter takes the full coffee cup from the machine. As he sips it, his eyes fall on a closet door just across the room. It is moving slightly. It is locked, but it bangs against the lock...once...twice...more regularly than if caused by the wind drafts. \nPeter steps closer. Now the door bangs violently with a loud crash, but it holds. Peter sets his coffee on the chart table and takes his rifle in both hands. \nAgain the door bangs hard, and a skeleton key is knocked out of the keyhole. It falls to the floor with a metallic clang, and Peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out of the closet, under the door and onto the linoleum. \nAnother bang and a gurgling moan. One of the living dead is trying to break out of the closet. \nQuite calmly. Peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door about head high. The rifle roars in the little room, and a splintery hole appears in the old wooden door. \n126\tOutside, Fran and Stephen snap to attention at the sound of the rifle. Fran stands at the entrance to one of the little wooden hangars. Stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old Cessna inside. Immediately, Stephen runs out and grabs Fran's hand. As they turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter, they are confronted with two Zombies, staggering slowly towards them through the dust cloud from the chopper. \nFran screams. They have no weapons with them. \nSteve:\tROGER...ROGER... \n127\tUnder the whirling chopper blades, Roger continues to fill the fuel tank. In the roar of the engine, he cannot hear anything else. \nA third Zombie lumbers toward the helicopter. Roger's back is to the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger. \n128\tInside the chart house. Peter stares at the closet door. It is still for a moment...then another moan and the door bangs again. \nPeter fires two shots, lower right and lower left of the first forming a triangle. \n", "test2_id": 76, "test3_input": "Peter:\tI'M HOPIN' THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND THEY CAN'T GET IN... \n546\tThe creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting close to the action. \n547\tThe men hop back into the car, it roars off with Roger still at the wheel. \n548\tAgain the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing Zombies. They fall and scatter. \n549\tThe car speeds down the concourse, turns the corner near where Fran watches at the Department Store game. We hear Steve's voice on the woman's walkie talkie. \nSteve:\tWE'RE OK...WE GOT IT MADE...IT'GONNA WORK. \nFran stares out through the roll cage. The Zombies are staggering weakly after the car. \n550\tWith another tailspin, the auto pulls up at the second set of doors. The men scramble out of the back seat, the Zombies outside try to crawl under the second trailer. The men shut them out easily, locking the door and planting alarms. They stand to look down the concourse. \n551\tThe creatures seem even more spread out now. \nSteve:\tHOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN... \nPeter:\tDUNNO. NOT TOO MANY. WE'LL GET 'EM EASY. WE GET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WE'RE GOIN' ON A HUNT! \nThe big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the telescope. \n552\tAs we see through the scope, cross hairs settle on the forehead of one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall. The face is magnified, distorted by the telescope. The gun roars and the head in the scope explodes with red. \n553\tThe creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the brain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon. \n554\tIt is night. The Zombies in the parking lot still group around the semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow piece of music starts to build. \n555\tThe creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall. They pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail. \n556\tFrom inside the concourse, the mob is muffled. Even the revolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the glass panels and they have no tools to pound with. \nThe auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering added protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They are the early warning devices against penetration. \n557\tThey camera starts to dolly back, the music builds. We see slain corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the building. It is like a battlefield after a war. \n558\tThe humans appear on the second storey balcony. Moving to the railing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are guerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have taken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look over their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he limps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms. \n559\tWe see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building. Zombies lie dead everywhere. The humans have captures the gold of the Gods...In this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven. \n560\tPeter's hand is on the maps of the Maintenance Corridor. He is drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near the firestair. \nPeter:\tWE PUT UP THE WALL HERE. THERE'S NO DOOR FROM THE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS, SO NOBODY'LL GET NOSEY...AND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE PLUMBING... \nSteve:\tWHY CAN'T WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY. HELL, THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS. \nPeter:\tI'M NOT JUST WORRYIN' ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR LATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE...LOOTERS MAYBE...I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT STAIRWAY EXISTS. \nThey look back at the map. \nPeter:\tTHE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS. WE'LL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL BRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP THE WALL. \n561\tThe men sit huddled. The large storage area is filled with mounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores, but the stuff all sits around in disarray. \n562\tBehind the wall of cartons, Roger seems to be sleeping, but he is sweating feverishly, and his face twitches. Fran has been trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead. Now she stops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head. She moves out to Stephen and Peter. \n563\tFran:\tHE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING. \nPeter:\tGOOD. \n564\tThe woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the cartons. There are bottles, vials and diabetic hypo syringes as well as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall. \nFran:\tI DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO... \nSteve:\tYOU'RE DOIN' FINE. \nFran:\tHIS LEG IS AWFUL...THE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST. CAN'T WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERE...TRY TO FIND A MED. UNIT... \n565\tSteve looks at Peter. The big trooper speaks softly. \nPeter:\tI'VE SEEN HALF A DOZEN GUYS GET BITTEN BY THOSE THINGS...NONE OF 'EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HOURS. \n566\tFran is stunned. Suddenly, Roger screams from behind the cartons. \nRoger:\tPETER...PETER...WHERE ARE YOU? \n567\tPeter:\tRIGHT HERE, BUDDY. \n568\tRoger is sitting up. His eyes look very dark and sunken. He is sweating even more profusely than before. \nRoger:\tYEAH...YEAH... \n", "test3_true": "569\tOutside, Fran sits on a carton. The men are still huddled around the spoils. Roger occasional shouts from the other room. \nRoger:\tWE DID IT, HUH, BUDDY? WE WHIPPED 'EM. \nPeter:\tTHAT'S RIGHT ROG. \nRoger:\tDIDN'T WE? PETER? DIDN'T WE WHIP 'EM? \nPeter:\tWE SURE DID, BUDDY. \nRoger:\tWE WHIPPED 'EM AND GOT IT ALL! WE GOT IT ALL! \nThe man's voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big storage area bouncing off barren walls. \n570\tA hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people are working on. A great network of two-by-fours are braced at the rear of the corridor, more lumber is wedged against walls making a frame. Stephen is slamming large nails into the framework for reinforcement. On the frame's face a masonite panel is nailed into place on one side. Peter works in the corridor. He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the new partition look like a finished wall. \nIn the corridor, there are power tools lying about and a vast array of other hardware in the gardening cart. Fran appears from out of the washrooms. She is carrying an old can of paint which has obviously been used. \nFran:\tTHIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOR TOUCH UP...IT LOOKS PERFECT. \nPeter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw driver. He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto the new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is a perfect match. \nSteve:\t(to Fran) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT BEFORE WE CLOSE IT OFF? \nFran:\tNO... \nThe woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper. \n571\tThe corpses from the hall have been carried out of the way. They are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony. It is a grisly sight. Fran turns away. \n572\tFran:\tNO. \nShe steps back through the unfinished partition, leans against the framework. Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke back a gag. Steve moves up behind her, but she feels another wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom. Steve sets down his hammer and follows. \n573\tThe woman is kneeling on the floor, propped up by her hands on the toilet seat. She is vomiting. Steve approaches quietly. His hand falls on her back. \nFran:\tLEAVE ME ALONE...IT'S ALRIGHT...IT'S MY PROBLEM. \nSteve:\tFRANNIE... \nFran:\tJUST GET OUTA HERE, STEPHEN...I DON'T WANT YOU HERE. \nThe man doesn't move. Fran reaches up, taking his hand. She clutches it tightly, indicating that she is not angry. \nFran:\tI DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME THIS WAY... \nAnother wave hits her and she wretches again. She pulls her hand back leaning over the toilet bowl. \nFran:\tPLEASE GO...I'M ALRIGHT...PLEASE... \nStephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room. The woman wretches but she is dry. She tries to swallow. Then sits on the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach. She fumbles with the flush handle, depressing it. The rushing water makes an ugly sound. Fran looks down at her stomach thinking of her pregnancy. \n574\tStephen steps out of the unfinished framework. Peter is gazing down the corridor at the pile of corpses. \nPeter:\tTHIS PLACE IS GONNA BE ROTTEN...WE GOTTA CLEAN UP, BROTHER. \nFlies buzz about the staring faces of the dead things on the balcony. \n575\tPeter's hands are on the round hatch wheel of an enormous safe. \nPeter:\tTHEY'RE USUALLY ON A TIMER...OPEN AT NINE...LOCKED AT FOUR...KEEPS THE BANKERS HONEST. \nThe wheel spins and Peter swings the giant door open. \n576\tInside is a huge safety deposit vault of a bank. The men stand for a moment in awe. The clean walls are lined with drawers and doors where depositors have stored their valuables. At one end of the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills. The men approach the piles of money, stooping down. \nThey each pick up packets of bills and flip through the edges... \nPeter stuffs several packets into his knapsack. Steve looks at him quizzically. \nPeter:\tYOU NEVER KNOW, BROTHER. \nSteve takes several stacks and stuffs them into his kit. He looks about the enormous vault. \nSteve:\tDON'T YA WONDER WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE GONNA THINK...GUYS IN THE FUTURE...DIGGIN' THE PLACE UP. IMAGINE ALL THE STUFF IN THESE BOXES... JEWELLERY...MAYBE THEY'LL FIGURE IT'S ALL SOME KIND OF OFFERING TO THE GODS...LIKE IN THE PYRAMIDS...A BURIAL CHAMBER. \nPeter:\tTHAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, NOW..... \n577\tWe see the men wheeling gardening carts piled with corpses. The sombre image is shocking as the figures move in silhouette against the bright store fronts with their displays of goods designed to attract shoppers to the sweet life the items pretend to represent. \n578\tAt the bank, Peter wheels a cart with several dead Zombies through the lobby. \n", "test3_id": 77}

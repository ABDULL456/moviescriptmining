{"test1_input": "Roger stares up at the grim faced Black. \nRoger:\tI COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT. \nThe black man just stares levelly into Roger's eyes. \nRoger:\tFRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER. HE DOES TRAFFIC FOR J.A.S. GOT A HELICOPTER AND HE'S RUNNIN' OUT WITH IT. AS'T ME T'COME. \nThe Black man smiles. \nRoger:\tYOU THINK IT'S RIGHT TO RUN? \nThe Black man shrugs again, then he stands and walks down the stairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down into the lingering gas mist. Roger follows. \n62\t A few landings down...a noise. The two Troopers freeze. The stairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready their weapons. \nThe sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls of someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath. \nThe men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward slightly, trying not to make a sound. \nSuddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. It falls against the wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls away from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly... robed...in black...is sees the Troopers... \nFigure:\t SENORES... PLEASE TO LET ME PASS... \nThe voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. The figure slumps and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish. \nRoger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his breath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at his chest. \nRoger tries to support him. \nRoger:\tLET'S GET HIM TO THE MEDICS... \nPriest:\t NO...NO...NO...PLEASE. JUST...LET ME PASS...MY SISTER...I GO UP TO SEVEN FLOOR...TO FIND MY SISTER... \nRoger:\tTHEY'RE TAKIN' EVERYONE DOWN...THEY PROBABLY BROUGHT HER DOWN...COME ONE... \nPriest:\t MY SISTER...SHE IS DEAD...THEY TELL ME... THE DEAD THEY DO NOT BRING DOWN. \nRoger and the Black Trooper shoot glances at one another. \nPriest:\t JUST LET ME PASS. MARTINEZ IS DEAD. THE PEOPLE OF 107 WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH NOW. THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE... BUT STRONG...THEY HAVE LITTLE...BUT THEY DO NOT GIVE IT UP EASILY. AND THEY GIVE UP THEIR DEAD...TO NO ONE! \nThe Priest goes into a coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger wants to help in some way. \nPriest:\t MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST WEEKS...IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING YOU FIND THEM... \nThe Troopers are shocked. The Priest struggles to his feet. \nPriest:\t I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES. NOW...YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL... \nThe old man starts up the stairs. Roger moves to help him, but the big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the gas mist, coughing. \nPriest:\t YOU ARE STRONGER THAN US...BUT SOON, I THINK...THEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU... \nThe old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears in the cloud... \nPriest:\t WHEN THE DEAD WALK, SENORES...WE MUST STOP THE KILLING...OR WE LOSE THE WAR... \n63\t In the basement of the large building, S.W.A.T. troopers pry at the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage area. \nThe rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers... \nThe nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are silent, not knowing what to expect. \nThere are three boards left...then two... \nWith a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies pushes into the hall. \nThey are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They are all ages, from the very old to the very young. \nThe riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough, and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring other troopers. \nThe men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush. \nCommander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT... \nThe rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by clutching ghouls. \nRoger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle. They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless onslaught. \n64\t As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage area, several Troopers move into the room. \nThe walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture. \n", "test1_true": "Two of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire and screaming can be heard from the hall. \nThe big Black man walks calmly into the room. Roger watches him. He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears roll down his cheeks. \nSome of the creatures are without arms and legs. Some have been eaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move. \nA young Black Zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one arm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his pistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches for more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls closer, its mouth wide. \nRoger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the creatures head with his automatic rifle. \nThe Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load the pistol. \nRoger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place where several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe about. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are eating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never look up. They don't seem to notice him at all. \nA loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. Roger looks up. \n65\t In the ceiling, a double set of loading doors has been opened. Several other Troopers look down into the storage area. \nTrooper:\tJESUS CHRIST. \nHe shines a light beam down towards Roger. \nTrooper:\tYOU OK DOWN THERE? \n64\t Roger nods. \n65\t Trooper:\tTHIS MUST BE WHERE THEY DUMPED 'EM IN. \n64\t Roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening. \n65\t Trooper:\tYOU NEED MORE MEN? \n64\t Roger shakes his head \"no\". \n65\t Trooper:\tJESUS CHRIST. \nThe trooper leaves the opening. He is replaced by two others who just stare down into the storage room through the weird, round lenses of their masks. \n66\t The distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again. The big Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a few steps forwards. He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and tied securely with clothes line. It looks like a mummy. It is writhing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head. \nNearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also writhing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet should be, has been torn open and is bloody. A stump kicks around the blood where a foot has been eaten off. The Black man fires into the thing's head. \nRoger:\tTHEY...ATTACK...EACH OTHER... \nBlack:\tJUST THE FRESH CORPSES...BEFORE THEY REVIVE... \nRoger:\tWHY DID THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEM HERE? WHY DON'T THEY TURN THEM OVER...OR...OR DESTROY THEM THEMSELVES...IT'S INSANE...WHY DO THEY DO IT? \nBlack:\t'CAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE THERE'S RESPECT IN DYING. \nThe big man fires into the head of another squirming Zombie. \n67\t In the halls of the building, Troopers fall and are pounced on by ghouls. Other Troopers fire their automatics through the heads of attacking Zombies. The riot troops try to stay organised, but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it is turning into a riot. \n68A\tThe buildings of Philadelphia loom in the moonlight. What few lights remain lit reflect in the waters of the Delaware. \n68B\tIt is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and an occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one another. \nThere are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina. They bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted the area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken chain in the wind. \nHalfway down the long dock is a little guard house. Inside, sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed guard. \nNearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large square pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters. Alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper and launches. \nThe other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another officer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter. \nThe blades of the J.A.S. Traffic Copter whine as they gear down for a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the gently bobbing heliport. \n69\t With the blades still spinning loudly, Stephen hops out of the cockpit. \nSteve:\tCOME ON...I NEED YOU. \nFrancine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of the machine. Steve runs, ducking under the blades, around to the woman's side of the cockpit, grabs her hand, and they make for the fuel pumps. \nSteve:\tI DON'T SEE ROGER. WE'LL GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES. \nFran:\tOH MY GOD! \n70\t The woman freezes in mid stride, and her action brings Stephen's eyes around to see what she is staring at. The two bodies which lie near the fuel pumps. \nSteve:\tYOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN IT AT ALL. IT'S TOUGH TO GET USED TO IT. \n", "test1_id": 75, "test2_input": "129\tThe two creatures advance slowly on Fran and Steve. \nSteve:\tJUST RUN. \nFran is petrified. She turns and looks behind them. They are boxed in by the hangars. \nSteve:\tRUN RIGHT PAST 'EM...RIGHT AROUND 'EM. THEY CAN'T CATCH YOU. \nShe hesitates. The Zombies draw closer. \nSteve:\tRUN, FRANNIE. GODDAMMIT, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU. WE CAN HANDLE THEM! \nFran charges up the little grade. She runs to the right of the creatures and they move in her direction, arms outstretched. As she draws near to the dead things, she hesitates again in fright. The creatures claw at the air. The one in front is within a few feet of the woman. \nSteve:\tRUN, FRANNIE. MOVE! \nFran stares into the dead, staring eyes of the lead Zombie. She is almost hypnotised. At the last instant, she runs and just gets past the creatures. A little up the grade, she turns and looks back, stopping again. \nOne Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran. The other continues to advance on Stephen. \n130\tStephen ducks back into the open hangar. It is very dark but for thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden boards of the structure. Stephen roots around among the greasy tools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge hammer. He runs out of the shed. \n131\tHe dodges around the lead Zombie, who staggers on with inertia. Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the grade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming against the ghoul's skull with all his might. \nThe creature staggers on for a few more steps, its head a bloody pulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in the dust. \nWithout breaking stride, Stephen grabs Fran's hand and the two run toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has turned around and is walking up the grade. \n132\tRoger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he sees the frightened couple making for the chopper. \n133\tAs Steve charges up the grade he sees the Zombie approaching Roger from behind.  Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The stumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its hands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the ground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't have his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun holster. \nSuddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature has walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap. \n134\tStephen and Fran have reached the chopper. Steve let's go of the woman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in the propeller draft. \n135\tThe Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars almost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and advances steadily toward the helicopter. \n136\tThe shot misses clean. He fires again. The bullet grazes the creature's face. It staggers from the impact, but does not fall. \n137\tRoger moves quickly for his high powered weapon. Steve fires two more rounds. \n138\tAnother miss and another graze, this time on the arm. \n139\tHe is about to shoot once more when Roger stops him, stepping up alongside. \nRoger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the creatures' brain. \n140\tThe Zombie falls and papers blow over its body. \n141\tIn the chart house. Peter fires several more shots into the closet door. Bullet holes appear just where the creature's head should be. There seems to be no way that the volley could have missed. \nSilence for a moment. Peter still holds his gun high. \nThen, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the room. Two small children burst out. One has no left arm; the other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. They are dead. They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door. \nPeter stares down at the creatures, revulsed.  He is so startled that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival instincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and thrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is about to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small Zombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces on his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes against its brother. \nNow Peter raises his gun. As the children try to scramble to their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession. First one creature falls; then the other. \nPeter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and disgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition. \nPeter breathes heavily. He stares at the small corpses. Instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door of the chart house. \n142\tBehind him, in the brightly sunlit doorway, we see the Zombie who first appeared at the window. The creature staggers forward. Peter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun. The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room. \nPeter stares into the creatures eyes. Then suddenly, out in the sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears with his rifle. Peter sees the man over the creature's shoulder. \n143\tSteve raises his gun and aims at the Zombie, but the barrel seems to be on a straight line with Peter. \n144\tPeter ducks quickly. Steve's gun fires. The bullet misses the creature cleanly and crashes into the room. It ricochets off the coffee machine. Another shot crashes through the glass in the front room. \nPeter crouches, still stuffing shells into his weapon. A third of Stephen's bullets tears through the Zombie's shoulder, but the creature still stands. It turns toward Peter slowly. Peter crawls under the table as another shot splatters into the coffee cups. \n145\tOnce again, Roger steps up beside Stephen.  He fires one carefully aimed shot, looking through his telescopic range- finder. \n146\tJust as Peter finishes loading his weapon, the Zombie crashes into the room, falling over the table and onto the floor. \n147\tFran is still kneeling in the dust, trying to keep herself from vomiting. Stephen rushes to her side. Roger, keeping his rifle poised, shouts toward the chart house. \nRoger:\tPETER. \n148\tThe big Black man appears in the doorway, snapping the safety on his rifle. \n", "test2_true": "152\tPeter advances with long strides. \n153\tStephen looks up when the Black man is a dozen steps away. Immediately, he sees the anger in Peter's eyes. The big Trooper then raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen. Steve tries to stand, but trips and falls on his back in the dust. In an instant, Peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle aimed at point blank range for the shivering man's forehead. \nFran screams through her choking... \nFran:\tNO...MY GOD...DON'T... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? \nPeter speaks calmly to Stephen, in low tones. \nPeter:\tYOU NEVER AIM A GUN AT ANYONE, MISTER. IT'S SCARY. ISN'T IT? ISN'T IT? \nStephen looks up at the tall man, shivering. Then Peter lowers his weapon and extends his hand, helping Stephen up onto his feet. \n154\tRoger clears the fuel hose from around the runners of the chopper. Peter climbs into the cockpit and sits in the rear without saying another word. \nRoger helps Fran climb aboard. Steve wanders around the front of the cockpit bubble and climbs into the Pilot's seat. Roger climbs in behind Fran as she squeezes into the uncomfortable space beside Peter. The big black offers the woman a sip of water, which she accepts. Then she lets her head flop wearily against the rear bulkhead. \n155\tSteve is urgently surveying his flight charts, shuffling the papers and trying to seem very busy after the embarrassment of the incident. \nSteve:\tWE GOTTA FIND FUEL. MAYBE CLOSER TO PITTSBURGH. \nRoger:\tNO, WE'VE GOTTA STAY OUT OF THE BIG CITIES. IT IT'S ANYTHING LIKE PHILLY WE MIGHT NEVER GET OUT ALIVE. \nPeter:\tWE MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF ANY PLACE ALIVE. WE ALMOST DIDN'T GET OUT OF HERE. \nRoger:\tWE'RE GETTIN' OUTA HERE FINE. AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE THINGS WE CAN HANDLE 'EM EASY. \nPeter:\tYEAH, WELL IT WASN'T \"THOSE THINGS\" THAT NEARLY BLEW ME AWAY! \nStephen turns around and is about to say something angrily. Roger stops him by speaking urgently. \nRoger:\tWE GOTTA STAY IN THE STICKS. THERE'S BOUND TO BE MORE LITTLE PRIVATE AIRPORTS UPSTATE. \nSteve:\t(reluctantly going back to his charts) THERE'S THE LOCKS ALONG THE ALLGHENY. FUEL STATIONS THERE, PRIVATE AND STATE. \nRoger:\tPROB'LY STILL MANNED. WE DON'T NEED THOSE HASSLES EITHER. \nSteve:\tTHEY'RE JUST OUT AFTER SCAVENGERS...LOOTERS... \nPeter:\tOH, YOU GOT THE PAPERS FOR THIS LIMOUSINE? \nSteve:\t(angrily) I GOT J.A.S. ID. SO DOES FRAN. \nPeter\tRIGHT. AND WE'RE OUT HERE DOIN' TRAFFIC REPORTS? WAKE UP, SUCKER. WE'RE THIEVES AND BAD GUYS IS WHAT WE ARE. AND WE GOTTA FIND OUR OWN WAY! \nThere is a long silence. The engine drones, but the helicopter still sits on the ground. The men look at each other. Peter takes a long slug of water. \nFran:\tJESUS CHRIST. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING.  WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO.  WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF WATER. WE NEED FOOD....STEPHEN, YOU NEED TO SLEEP. \n156\tWe see a wide shot of the little airfield. The J.A.S. chopper sits on the ground for a moment, it's props spinning. The, with a surge of power, it lifts off and flies away. The dry earth swirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper over the wide-eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight. \n157\tWe see the facade of an enormous structure. It is a huge, suburban shopping mall. The outer walls are all concrete, and their clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys. The building looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground. There are only four entrances, and the shops which are housed within have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot. \n158\tIn the immense area around the building, lanes and stalls are painted for automobile parking. What few cars now dot the area are parked randomly, some with their doors open wide. \n159\tWe hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in, then we see the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the roof of the building. \n160\tIn the parking lot, walking among the abandoned vehicles, we see several of the living dead.  They look almost like normal shoppers at the mall for morning chores, but their lumbering\twalk is unmistakably stiff. 161\tAt one of the mall entrances, we see a revolving door flanked by several regularly hinged doors, all made of glass and surrounded by large windows. A few of the Zombies manage to\tnegotiate the hinged doors and enter the building. Others bounce off windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion. One creature walks around in the revolving door endlessly. \nThere are a good many of the creatures, but they are spread out and far between. They move with no seeming purpose. We do not yet see the mall interior.  The Zombies pay no\tattention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead. \n162\tOn the roof, even as the blades of the helicopter still spin, the humans are out and moving to the edge of the building. They look down at the creatures which dot the parking lot. \nFran:\tOH MY GOD! \nStephen:\tNO CHANCE. FORGET IT, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE. Roger:\tWAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE...THEY CAN'T\t\t\tGET UP HERE. Steve:\tYEAH, AND WE CAN'T GO DOWN THERE! \nRoger:\tLET'S CHECK IT OUT. Roger trots away. 163\tPeter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of transparent Plexiglas bubbles face down into the building. He stares through one of them and can see into the mall below. Roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles. Peter:\tMOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINK\t\t\tTHEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164\tThe vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior, a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent bubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which is two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can be seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy metal cage gates down and locked into position. One or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter the stores, except for the one which is un-gated. \nHalfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings the entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. The same cage- gates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead creatures are evident on the balcony. \n165\tFran and Stephen come trotting up to the bubbles. \nRoger:\tI HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR. \nPeter:\tTHE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES USUALLY USE BOTH FLOORS. \nRoger:\tIF WE CAN GET IN UP TOP... \n166\tPeter is looking across the rest of the expansive rooftop. He takes off toward a series of other housings which jut up out of the otherwise flat surface. Roger follows. \n", "test2_id": 76, "test3_input": "703\tSeveral creatures now wander through the Department Store, having entered from the second storey gate. They move through aisles knocking against displays. One grabs a mannequin thinking it human, throws the dummy aside roughly. \n704\tThe raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies. He runs down the corridor to the Maintenance office. Peter is gone. Breaking into the various empty offices, the raider comes to the fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere. Then he hears the faint barking of the dog. He checks the panel again by running his hand along the edge. \nSuddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns. There are three ghouls coming. He fires and knocks off the ghouls one at a time and runs onto the balcony. \n705\tBikes roar this way and that. It is a war zone. \n706\tThe man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above. He spins and looks up. He sees Peter just too late. \n707\tThe big Trooper, in an open ceiling grid, aims his super-gun squarely at the raider's head. The gun roars and the man flies. \n708\tBelow, the raiders are starting to regroup. The bikes begin to peel out of the mall entrance one at a time. \n709\tAnother raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies. \n710\tThe bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman driver gets ready to pull out. She lowers her window and fires point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures. \n711\tThe last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance. The Zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside. The men shoot and beat their way to the cycles. One man is brought down, but three manage to mount their cycles. The big bikes roar out. \n712\tPeter is crawling through the ductwork. Just as he opens a grid, he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse. He levels off with his scope. \n713\tHe shoots one raider out of the saddle. Two others get out. \n714\tRegrouping in the lot, the band of twenty is now seven or eight. \n715\tOne last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the concourse. He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance. He is the leader. The one who was on the radio. He whoops victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors. \n716\tPeter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on the back of the riders head. He waits as the biker roars out onto the lot. The rider lets out one last victorious shout in the fresh air. Peter's scope is locked on the riders back and the super-gun roars. The biker is blown off his machine. \n717\tThe bike flies into a pack of Zombies. Some fall back, but others advance on the rider. The man rolls over the cement, stops, not dead yet. He screams wildly as they move onto him. \n718\tThe other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade away. \n719\tThe puppy stops barking. Fran is tense in the darkness clutching her rifle. She stands on the now silent landing. \n720\tIn the parking lot and main concourse the Zombies move freely. They fight over the remains of the corpses. They eat ravenously, the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area. \n721\tPeter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork. Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button. \nSteve:\tPETER! \nPeter:\tWHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? \nSteve:\tIN THE ELEVATOR! \nPeter:\tLISTEN, THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. CLIMB UP TOP...I'LL GET YOU OUT THE GRID ON THE SHAFT...I'M COMIN. \nPeter starts to crawl through the ducts. \n722\tSteve hits the second floor button and the car moves. He clamours up on the hand rail on the car. His hands reach up and grab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the opening. He kicks with his legs to force himself up when the car stops. He sees the grid in the shaft wall. \n723\tSuddenly, the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly several Zombies dart into the car. They claw at Steve's legs and pull him out of the hatch. He screams, thrashes violently. \n724\tIn the duct, Peter hears the screams. He stops and listens for a moment. He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor. \n725\tIn the elevator, Steve thrashes with all his might. The ghouls try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and close repeatedly against the creatures which block it. \nA Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck. The man scrambles to unholster his gun. Although he is bleeding profusely, he finally pulls his gun and fires...once...twice... \n726\tPeter is dropping out of the washroom duct. He hears the pistol shots and realises Steve is not dead. He thinks about climbing back in the grid, but stops. He punches at the wall violently. He is angry and confused. \n727\tAgain the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head, flying out of the elevator. The doors still slam against the last creature and Steve fires. The Zombie flies back and the doors finally close. \n728\tOutside, Zombies fall against the elevator doors. \n729\tInside, Steve falls to the floor. His neck runs red. His eyes are wide with terror. He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in his hand. He finds it hard to breathe. \n730\tPeter appears at the bottom of the firestair. The puppy runs to meet him, tails wagging and yapping. He hangs his head as Fran looks down. \nFran:\tNO.....NO! \nShe runs down the steps. The big Trooper catches her bodily as she is about to charge out into the hall. \nPeter:\tI HEARD HIS GUN...MAYBE HE'S ALRIGHT...WE'LL WAIT...WE'LL JUST WAIT A WHILE... \n731\tThe mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn. \n732\tZombies move through the building freely, walking the halls, lumbering through the stores. \n733\tSeveral creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors. As they push each other, one creature inadvertently makes contact with the elevator call button. \nThe doors glide open. Steve is standing, his blood dry now. His eyes are blank as he steps forward. The creatures step away seeing that he is no longer prey...he is among them now. \n", "test3_true": "734\tUpstairs, Fran is packing her sack slowly and ponderously. Her face is red from crying. \n735\tPeter stands at the stair top looking down at the landing. \n736\tFran sets the sack down at the escape ladder leading to the roof. She deliberately goes to fill another sack. \n737\tOn the mall balcony, Stephen's corpse walks to the Maintenance corridor. He looks past other wandering Zombies and sees the fake partition. Something in him remembers. He moves forward. \n738\tFran:\tIT'S ALMOST LIGHT...LET'S GO. \nPeter looks at her silently from the stairway door. \nFran:\tHE DOESN'T ANSWER THE RADIO...IT'S BEEN HOURS... \nShe starts to cry again. \nFran:\tFOR GOD SAKE. YOU BETTER COME ON BECAUSE IF I GET TO THINKIN' ABOUT THIS, I'LL JUST GO ON DOWN THERE AND LET THEM...LET THEM... \nThe puppy suddenly growls. It charges between Peter's feet and runs floppily down the steps. \n739\tIn the hallway, Steve pounds at the fake wall. Other creatures notice and they all move toward the partition. \n740\tUpstairs, the pounding can be heard. Peter stands stoically, looking down into the darkness. The dog barks below. \nFran:\tWHAT IS IT? \nPeter:\tIT'S STEPHEN...THEY'RE COMIN' UP! \n741\tWith a great crunching noise the partition gives way from the army of creatures. \n742\tPeter slams the door. He speaks quietly. \nPeter:\tGO ON...YOU GET OUT OF HERE. \nFran:\tPETER... \nPeter:\tI SAID...GET OUT OF HERE. \nFrom the firestair, we hear the sudden yelping of the puppy as it falls victim to the creatures. The sound echoes through the barren spaces of the storage area. \nFran:\tOH, JESUS, PETER...PLEASE... \nPeter:\tI DON'T WANT TO GO...I REALLY DON'T... YOU KNOW THAT? I REALLY DON'T. \n743\tSuddenly, the door flies open and the creatures lumber into the living space. Peter stares at them. He smiles slightly. The creatures advance, led by Stephen. \n744\tFran starts to scream. \nFran:\tSTEPHEN...STEPHEN... \nShe makes a slight move for her lover, but Peter raises his super-gun and shoots the Zombie through the head. \nAs Stephen falls, Fran comes up short. The act startles her into awareness. Peter faces her as the creatures come up behind him. \nPeter:\tMOVE, WOMAN! \n745\tFran grabs the sacks and climbs the ladder to the roof. \n746\tThe creatures advance on Peter. He backs away, trying to lead them from the skylight. They crash through the living space, upsetting the carefully planned room. \n747\tOn the roof, Fran desperately starts the helicopter engine. \n748\tPeter backs into the storage room, slamming the door. The creatures approach the door and the super-gun roars one last time. The Zombies push through the door and move in for their feast. \n749\tSeveral zombies manage to scramble up the skylight to the roof. \nFran stares, transfixed. The blades roar up to full speed. \nThe creatures advance toward the machine. \nFran steps out onto the running board; the creatures very close now. She crouches, watching for a moment, then looks up at the spinning blades. \nShe stands straight up, driving her head into the spinning blades. \nA headless form falls to the roof. The Zombies advance. \n750\tIn a wide shot, silhouetted against the dawn sky, we see the creatures huddled under the chopper blades, feasting on their last victim. \nThe credits crawl up. \nJust as the credits end... \n", "test3_id": 77}

It's around 10 o'clock the same morning as the capital district, in its own way, is showing signs of the approaching Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. 
EXT. A CHROME AND GLASS BUILDING - DAY 
On the seventh floor of the building. A RECEPTIONIST tells us where we are by answering the phone-- 
RECEPTIONIST (V.O.) Global Defense Council... 
SUSAN (V.O.) You wanted to see me? 
LEO (V.O.) I just got off the phone with A.J. MacInerney. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LEO SOLOMON'S OFFICE - DAY 
LEO, a white-haired man in his early 60's is meeting with SUSAN SLOAN, a 40'ish lawyer who seems to go out of her way to create an issue where none exists. 
SUSAN Did the President read the letter? 
LEO The President's pissed as hell, Susan. That letter was a stupid move. 
SUSAN It was aggressive, and we should stand by every-- 
LEO This isn't the guy who needed us four years ago, Susan. He's incredibly popular. He's gonna win re-election in a walk, and he could give a shit what we stand by! If the President passes the most important piece of environmental legislation in history, and does it despite our negative endorsement, our political weight in the future will rank somewhere below the Save the Spotted Owl Society. (beat) I'm bringing in some help. 
SUSAN We don't need another environmental expert to confirm what every other environmental expert-- 
LEO Not an environmental expert, a professional political strategist. We're playing hardball with Andrew Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat. 
SUSAN Who? 
LEO Sydney Ellen Wade. 
SUSAN Oh Christ. That woman doesn't know the first thing about the environmental lobby. 
LEO She's a closer, Susan. She gets the job done.

SHEPHERD and LEWIS -- working on a speech. 
SHEPHERD Try it like this and lose that. 
ROBIN (entering) David Sasser from the Times called and wanted to know what the White House felt was a great society. 
LEWIS What did you tell him? 
ROBIN I told him I couldn't speak for the President, but for my money: Bermuda. 
SHEPHERD Perfect. 
JANIE steps in-- 
JANIE Mr. President, your cousin Judith's come down with the flu and won't be able to join you Thursday night. 
SHEPHERD That's too bad. Remind me to give her a call later. 
JANIE Yes, sir. 
ROBIN You gonna go stag? 
SHEPHERD That's not a problem. 
ROBIN No. We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower. 
The words came out casually, but they instantly freeze everyone. 
ROBIN (continuing) My God. (beat) I can't believe I said that. (beat) Mr. President, that was an incredibly thoughtless remark. I would never dream of insulting you or the memory of your wife. 
SHEPHERD That's okay, forget it. (to JANIE) What time is it? 
JANIE It's 3:45, sir. 
SHEPHERD I'm gonna go over and say hi to Lucy. 
JANIE You have the Attorney General at 4:00 and the trade representative at 4:30. Somewhere in there you promised NPR five minutes. 
ROBIN Mr. President-- 
SHEPHERD Robin, don't worry about it.

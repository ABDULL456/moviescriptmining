104   INT. JAIL CELL                                                104 Kumar walks away from the cell, goes over to the desk, picks up the bag of weed and caresses it... 
HAROLD What the hell are you... Suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room, pushing a black man wearing pajamas (NATHANIEL BANKS). Nathaniel seems very gentle. He's even wearing a turtleneck sweater. 
OFFICER PALUMBO (to Nathaniel) You thought you could get away with this, huh? 
NATHANIEL Where am I? I was in bed.         I didn't fire any gun, I swear... Suddenly, Officer Reilly looks over to the jail cell... 
OFFICER REILLY (pointing) Look! All the cops turn to the cell. Kumar is still holding the weed. He doesn't know what to do. Harold is scared shitless. 
OFFICER PALUMBO (re: Tarik) Shit! Jackson's trying to escape! Tarik looks up from his book... 
TARIK What?     Oh, not again! The cops handcuff Nathaniel to the leg of a desk, and run over to the jail cell, ignoring Kumar and the weed. 
OFFICER PALUMBO Stop trying to escape! 
TARIK I'm not trying to escape!        Look at me, I'm sitting down! They turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm into the room. Harold stands back, confused. Tarik leans against the wall, ready to be handcuffed. The cops grab him and throw him down against the bed.

OFFICER REILLY He's trying to break free! Hold him tight! In the midst of all the action, Kumar grabs Harold and pulls him out of the cell. HAROLD GOES OVER TO PALUMBO'S DESK AND PICKS UP HIS WALLET AND LAPTOP, along with the police report. They start running out of the room. Kumar's still clinging to the weed. 
HAROLD (to Kumar) Wait-- shouldn't we do something about this? 
NATHANIEL (to Harold) If I were you, I'd get out of here as soon as possible. With that, Harold and Kumar run out... 
105   EXT. POLICE STATION                                       105 HAROLD and KUMAR (still clinging to the weed) burst out the door and run down the steps. They race through the street and start heading towards a FOREST. 
KUMAR Hurry up! 
106   EXT. FOREST - 3:20 AM                                     106 HAROLD and KUMAR have stopped running.   They start catching their breath. 
HAROLD Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking mad house! Thanks for getting me out of there, dude. 
KUMAR Hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there. (beat, re: weed) Dude, look at this. It's like we went from being broke to being millionaires. Suddenly, they hear what sounds like A COYOTE'S HOWL. 
HAROLD What was that? 
KUMAR Just a coyote. Don't worry. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   83. 
HAROLD Aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes? 
KUMAR That's only because they sound scary. In one on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down. 
SUDDENLY, A CHEETAH JUMPS OUT FROM BEHIND A BUSH AND LETS OUT 
A MONSTROUS ROAR! 
KUMAR (CONT'D) Now cheetahs, they're another story. The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down. 
HAROLD We're gonna die. 
KUMAR Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit. They're not known for eating humans. 
WITH THAT, THE CHEETAH WALKS OVER TO A NEARBY BUSH AND DRAGS 
OUT A HALF-EATEN HUMAN CORPSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN DEVOURING. 
HAROLD We're gonna die. 
KUMAR Okay, I'll admit, that's not a good sign. But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll probably leave us alone. HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins walking directly over to HAROLD... 
HAROLD (whispering) This isn't working.

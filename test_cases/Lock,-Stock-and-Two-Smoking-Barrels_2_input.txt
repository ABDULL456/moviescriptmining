DOG OK, open the gate. 
No sooner said than done. Dog hits one straight on Winston's forehead with the butt of his gun and drags him to the stairs. 97 
INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY DOG 
Up boy, up, up. 
They reach the top of the stairs. 
Tie 'em up John and, Plank, you come with me. Where's the money? 
PLANK There, in those shoe boxes. 
Dog opens them. There is nothing in them. If looks could kill Plank would be pushing up daisies. 
DOG (gun to the head of Winston) Where? 
WINSTON Out the back. 
DOG And the weed? 
WINSTON Out the back. 
MICK Point. 
WINSTON With what? 
MICK Your hands, now! 
WINSTON I can't, I am tied up. 
MICK Well, well, shake your head or something. 
DOG All right Plank, get Paul out of the van. 
This is done on a walky talky. 
INT. SLOANES' BACK ROOM - DAY 
The door opens. Willie is waiting behind it armed with a machete. He turns to his opponent and, eyes shut for Dutch courage, hacks straight into Mick's arm. Mick's machine gun goes off and William loses a finger as he tries to push the barrel to the side. He starts screaming uncontrollably 
DOG (to Plank) Give us your knife. 
Dog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to its source. William is silenced through fear of the approaching Dog and slumps on the floor in a silenced wreck, holding a bleeding hand. 
(the point of the blade resting on William's throat) Enough! Mick, how you doing? 
MICK How do you think I am doing? He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off. 
Dog's attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash, neatly packed and stacked. 
PAUL (in doorway visibly shocked Gordon Bennett! What's been going on in here? 
DOG Shut up, you idiot. You got the bags? Can you get it in? 
PAUL There's a lot here, all right. I don't think we will be able to get this all in the van. 
DOG Bollocks, you'll get it in even if you have to do two trips. 
EXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - DAY 
A traffic warden appears as Paul goes outside to load up.

MATT What? (beat) Sure, yeah. I mean, I didn't, always- 
ANDREW (O.S.) Why not? 
MATT Don't get mad, I mean, I like you now, I like you a lot. You're just, you're not super easy to talk to. You've got a lot of- 
ANDREW (O.S.) You're an asshole. 
MATT See, that's what I'm saying. You're hostile, man. 
ANDREW (O.S.) (beat) You know, you...If you hadn't invited me to that party, none of this would've happened. 
MATT Yeah. 
ANDREW (O.S.) Thanks. 
Matt laughs. 
INT. MATT'S CAR - AFTERNOON - WAL-MART PARKING LOT 
None of the guys are visible.   They're filming a woman park her car. 
STEVE (O.S.) I just always feel like I miss stuff. 
MATT (O.S.) We were just sitting around throwing rocks, it was nothing. 
ANDREW (O.S.) Yeah, until all those chicks showed up. 
STEVE (O.S.) What?   Shut up. 
MATT (O.S.) Okay, here we go, here we go. 
ANDREW (O.S.) Are you sure there's no one around- 
MATT (O.S.) There's no one, I just looked, just go, ready? (beat) Ready? (MORE) MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D) Okay, Andrew, remember, get under it, you're the strongest, Steve get the sides, I'll get the front and back, we gotta do this quick. Countdown. Three. Two. One. GO. 
The car the woman parked shakily lifts off, and immediately dips right. 
MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D) Steve Steve Steve- 
STEVE (O.S.) Got it, got it. 
Silence, and we watch as the car gets to about twelve feet in the air, makes a full 180 degree rotation, and then wobbles through the air over to a spot several spaces away, and then sets down, neatly in place. 
STEVE (CONT'D)                  MATT (O.S.) FUCK YEAH! BOOYAH!              YES! FUCK YES! OH SHIT, blood- 
EXT. WAL-MART - PARKING LOT - SHORTLY THEREAFTER 
Matt is sitting against the car with a wad of kleenex on his nose, soaked with blood. Steve is leaning nearby, with a brown paper napkin. 
MATT (beat) My braingina is having like a...face period. STEVE Yeah, you got some from your ears, too. You've gotta start working it out more, Matt. 
MATT Yeah man, in between my yoga. 
ANDREW (O.S.) You just need focus, Matt. 
MATT Ha. 
ANDREW (O.S.) You're lucky you got the kleenex, I'm stuck with the taco bell wrapper.

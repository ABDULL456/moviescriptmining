Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in silence, bruised and covered in garbage. 
CARTER You lied to me. 
LEE I'm sorry. 
CARTER You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home. 
LEE No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed. 
Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck. 
CARTER So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew up the Embassy? 
EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING 
Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12 year olds are going through their warm up routines. 
MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids. 
CARTER I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner. 
LEE This won't take long. 
Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES. 
MASTER FU Dragon kick! 
Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D) Lotus block! 
The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu notices Carter and Lee watching from the back. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D) Twisting Tiger! 
No response.  The students exchange baffled looks. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D) (staring straight at Lee) Twisting Tiger! 
Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in the glow... 
...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D) Didn't I teach you to always arch your back? 
LEE (bowing, humbled) Yes, Master. 
While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12 YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 
Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up. 
CARTER I was watching you kids.  My name is Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree black belt.  At least that's what I tell the girls at the Holiday Health Spa where I work out. 
Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no reaction. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Let me give you kids some tips.  The key to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why don't you stand up. 
THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw punches. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show you how to block.  Come on, stand up, give me your best shot -- try to kick right to my head. 
The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION. 
CARTER (CONT'D) That's pretty good.  Which one of you kids did that? 
INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

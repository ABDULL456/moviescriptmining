SWANNEY 
Sure, sure. I've heard it before. 
RENTON 
The Sick Boy method. 
They both look at Sick Boy 
SWANNEY 
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him. 
RENTON 
He's always been lacking in moral fibre. 
SWANNEY 
He knows a lot about Sean Connery. 
RENTON 
That's hardly a substitute. 
SWANNEY 
you'll need one more hit. 
RENTON 
No, I don't think so. 
SWANNEY 
To see you through the night that lies ahead. 
Freeze Frame on Swanney. 
RENTON (v.o) 
We called him the mother superior on account of the length of his habit. He knew all about it. On it, off it, he knew it all. Of course I'd have another shot: after all, I had work to do. 
INT. RENTON'S FLAT ROOM. DAY 
The door opens and Renton enters carrying shopping bags. He empties them on to a mattress beside three buckets and a television. 
RENTON (v.o) 
Relinquishing junk. Stage One: preparation. For this you will need: one room which you will not leave; one mattress; tomato soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption cold; ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of; Magnesia, Milk of, one bottle; paracetamol; mouth wash; vitamins; mineral water; Lucozade; pornography; one bucket for urine, one for feces, and one for vomitus; one television; and one bottle of Valium, which I have already procured, from my mother, who is, in her own domestic and socially acceptable way, also a drug addict. 
Renton swallows several Valium tablets. Voice-over continues. 
And now I'm ready. All I need is a final hit to soothe the pain while the Valium takes effect. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Swanney, Sick Boy, Spud and Allison and Baby all lie inert while the telephone rings. 
INT. CALL BOX. DAY 
Renton curses as he slams down the receiver. He dials again. 
RENTON 
Mikey. It's Mark Renton. Can you help me out? 
INT. MIKEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Renton holds two opium suppositories in the palm of his hand. 
RENTON (v.o) 
This was typical of Mikey Forrester.

What the fuck are these?

Much CHEERING and jovial approval from the Crowd. On its fringes, Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits make their way roughly across the Square. 
SHEENY MIKE Any Irish hears that will be out for blood. 
AMSTERDAM The Irish is too busy building up Tammany. That's where their brains and muscle goes. Once they're inside with their cronies, they turn on their own outside. Tammany'd steal the air and rent the daylight if they could. 
SHEENY MIKE We'd do the same. 
AMSTERDkM Not against our own we wouldn't. That's the difference. 
JOHNNY Tammany earns better. That's the difference. 
AMSTERDAM I ain't seen their ned yet. 
Johnny stops walking, betraying slight annoyance that he has to explain the day's deal. 
JOHNNY You will at day's end, that's our arrangement. A quarter a voter, whether they're repeaters or not. I'm telling you, we got a square deal. 
SHEENY MIKE It's sound, Amsterdam. 
AMSTERDAM Yeah? Well, it's ned anyway. Just make sure you count it when we get it. 
JOHNNY It's just a day's job, we don't have to make it a life's work. We work for Tammany today and kill them tomorrow, if that's our pleasure. 
JIMMY SPOILS So we're politicians just for today. 
AMSTERDAM Not for a minute. We're better than that. We're thieves. 
CUT TO 
58 MONTAGE 
The Dead Rabbits go about the business of rounding up Tammany voters. They pick up DRUNKS in alleys; Jenny and some of the Dead Rabbit MORTS raust PATRONS in a whore house; Rabbits shanghai SAILORS from saloons; corral CITIZENS as they walk along the street, either wheedling or bullying to get them to vote. It's the strong arm of democracy. 
CUT TO 
59 EXT. POLLING PLACE DAY 
On one side of the door, some Dead Rabbits, with a RABBLE of potential voters; on the other, POLICE doing their best. Behind and all around, various WARD HEELERS and SMALL-TIME POLITICIANS, representing both the Know-Nothing candidate Barker and Tammany's Fernando Wood. Varicus factions push and pull at one another as they wedge their VOTERS into the polls. 
JIMMY SPOILS He's got the right to vote, damn you! COP Not four times he don't. (shoves a Voter) There'll be no damned repeaters here! 
The Cop and Jimmy play tug-of-war with a besotted VOTER, while other gang members rush to GRAB VOTERS leaving the polls. 
PANDEMONIUM. 
CUT TO 
60 INT. TAMMANY HALL DAY 
The main floor is jammed with CLUBMEN and PARTY RACKS. Daniel Killoran bustles from group to group, making promises, taking notes and searching out Boss Tweed, who is holding court in a far corner, surrounded by JOURNALISTS. 
BOSS TWEED I would never speak ill of a rival. I would never say that every Know-Nothing is a horse thief. It is my observation, however, that every horse thief is a Know-Nothing. 
Good-natured LAUGHING all around. Even TWEED seems amused. Killoran catches the Boss' eye and whispers to him. 
KILLORAN The Know-Nothings are already finished, and there's four more hours at the polls yet. 
BOSS TWEED Keep our men voting. Everybody works today. It's not a victory we need, Daniel. I want a triumph. 
CUT TO 
61 INT. DON WHISKERANDOSO BARBER SHOP DAY 
Amsterdam roughly deposits REPEAT VOTERS in the barber chairs, as the BARBERS work FRANTICALLY to cut their hair, prune beards, and otherwise alter appearances. As soon as one customer is done, Sheeny Mike douses him with bay rum and pushes another REPEATER down in his place. Johnny keeps count of the turnover. 
DON WHISKERANDOS (BARBER) 
Now that's eight... and how many still to come ... 
He looks toward the door, where more Repeaters are lined up, waiting their turn under close supervision. 
REPEATER I already voted once today. Cast for Tammany, by God, and Fernando Wood. 
AMSTERDAM Once? Come here and do your duty. 
Amsterdam GRABS him and SLAMS him down in a chair. 
CUT TO 
62 INT. FAN-TAN PARLOR DAY 
Amsterdam and some RABBITS BURST into the front door, frightening and scattering all the Chinese GAMBLERS. 
AMSTERDAM (barking orders) Line up like soldiers! 
SHEENY MIKE They got no notion what you're talking about. 
AMSTERDAM (To Johnny) You explain their democratic right. Illl see they unterstand. 
Amsterdam GRABS the nearest two CHINESE by their PIGTAILS and HURLS them against the wall. 
CUT TO 
63 INT. OPIUM DEN 
Amsterdam and the Rabbits PROWL the murky darkness where OPIUM EATERS lie in bunks stacked high against the walls. The Rabbits start ROUSING and rounding up the Opium Eaters. Jimmy Spoils SLINGS a couple over his shoulder like flour sacks. Amsterdam SHOVES two more out the door, past an admiring Daniel Killoran. 
KILLORAN (to Johnny) I come to see if our counts square. You boys have made a remarkable showing.... 
AMSTERDAM Who the hell's this?

The army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening. 
INT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing fear.  Then creaks the door open. 
INT. QUEEN'T TOWER 
BAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil power. 
BAVMORDA Kael! 
Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear- ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS. Kael bows. 
KAEL Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child. 
The baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav- morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back. 
BAVMORDA We must start the ritual! 
She hears noise outside the castle. 
BAVMORDA Who is that? 
KAEL An army of rebels and traitors. 
Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically: 
BAVMORDA Where is Sorsha? 
KAEL She has turned against you. 
Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids: 
BAVMORDA Purify the altar!  Arrange the im- plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha! 
The druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms out the door. 
EXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK 
The Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires. Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor- da leers down at them and laughs. 
BAVMORDA This is not an army! 
Sorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar- mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback. 
RAZIEL Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick! Hide! 
Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent. 
INT. TENT 
Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him. 
RAZIEL Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself! 
WILLOW Why? 
RAZIEL Just do it! 
Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to chant. 
EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE 
Madmartigan faces the queen. 
MADMARTIGAN We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn her over to us! 
Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him. 
BAVMORDA You dare to challenge me?  You are not warriors.  You're pigs! 
She waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape. His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous. 
BAVMORDA You're all pigs! 
The rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly, they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields. 
SORSHA Mother!  No!! 
BAVMORDA You made your decision!

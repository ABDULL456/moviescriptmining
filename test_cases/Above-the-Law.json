Then: in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then: Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters, being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them. Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END. \nDISSOLVE TO: 2   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH. SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage whips in the fierce downdraft as -- 3   \"HUEY\" GUNSHIP with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several machine gun positions around the LZ. 4   EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually marks a CIA \"spook.\" \n5   HELICOPTER touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before. \n6   LEADER OF THREE \nwears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45. 7   NICO AND FOX \ndon't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness. \nFOX You ever see chemical interrogation before? \nNico's eyes stay on the approaching \"cowboy,\" KURT ZAGON, for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity. NICO These assholes are agency? \n8    NICO'S POV FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboy's hand. \n9    BACK TO FOX AND NICO FOX We're all C.I.A. But these guys are from a page that ain't on the map. 10   EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail. We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at home   in the jungle. 11   TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies. ZAGON How long till we're across the border? NICO We've been over for the past hour. The group continues along the ridge. \nCUT TO: 12   EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT \nThe sky glows from nearby bomb attacks. 13   NICO \nlistening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette. ZAGON What are you looking at, hotshot? \nNICO (indicates cigarette glow) Why don't you light a bonfire? \nNico takes a step toward Zagon. NICO What the fuck does this have to do with military intelligence? ZAGON Your orders are 'assist and observe' cherry -- Zagon turns to face Nico -- \nFOX (to Nico) Back off, partner -- Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner, close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight. ZAGON (to second prisoner) I'm gonna start carving at your ankles. We'll throw your feet in that box right over there. Then I'm gonna take off your arms -- One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as Zagon. NICO (can't take much more) Fox -- FOX Shut up, Nico. \nZAGON You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid -- \nZagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade. Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico. Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico out of the hooch -- 30   EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT \nFox wrestles Nico away from the hooch -- \nFOX Are you crazy?!! (as Nico jerks free) What the fuck's the matter with you?!!! Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the hooch -- FOX Nico! NICO I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me later. \nThe last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway. Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again -- \nFOX I'll cover this. Get back to the L.Z. -- (as Nico resists) -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the fuck outa here! The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect, pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The troops, confused, hold up for a moment. \nFOX (to Nico) I'll call for a chopper... get outa here! \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        8. \nNico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES. Nico disappears into the darkness. \nFADE TO BLACK. FADE IN ON: \n31   CHURCH STEEPLE - DAY \nTILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in, then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if they're late -- 32   INT. ST. MARY'S - DAY \nA baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife        * -- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm around Sara.                                                  * \n33   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the sunlight by several \"old country\"-type women. Wine is poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently the party has come here straight from the church. Presents for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara,        * and Nico's mother, ROSA. SARA                                   * Mama, look at this -- all done by hand. \nSara lifts a cute baby outfit.                                 * ROSA Nico had one just like this.   Thank you, Cora. Cora, an aunt, proudly smiles. \n34   NICO \nHolding the baby. Realizes that his little son has pooped in his pants. He turns for help to Sara.                       * \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           9. \nNICO I think we got a little problem here. \nSARA                                  * (winking at the women) I carried him for the last nine months, you take him for the next diaper. \nAssorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as Nico tries awkwardly to deal with the problem. NICO (to all) That's what you get for not marrying a Sicilian. Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over.               * \nSARA                                     * My brave husband. He's not afraid of thieves and muggers, but he's terrified when his son poops in his pants. Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple and their baby. \n35   ANOTHER PART OF BACK YARD Three Chicago cops, LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform wolf some Italian goodies while eying the group of celebrating relatives. LUKICH (indicates Nico across the patio) Toscani holds the record... for havin' more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in Chicago. \nNICO Mrs. Z. (tries to be light) Is this a way to act on the day of my son's baptism? The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes. \nSARA                                * It's Lucy.   She's gone again. Nico glances from Sara to Rosa.                              * \nMrs. Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain. Nico holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara.            * NICO It's that kid from the bar on Damen? The one with the drugs? \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          13. \nSara doesn't know. Nico does.     He comforts Mrs. Zingaro   * another moment, then stands. \nNICO Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening? (as the woman nods miserably) I have to go to work now. But I'll come by tonight. You'll be at the bakery? MRS. ZINGARO Si, Nico. NICO We'll talk, okay? We'll find a way to take care of this. \nNico kisses Mrs. Z. He takes Sara's hand in goodbye,         * starts for the door. 47   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY Festivities still in progress. Nico passes through, nodding, thanking people for coming, taking farewells. Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch. 48   INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING Nico is driving.   Jackson checks in on the radio. JACKSON (into mike) Unit Ten Tango X-ray.    We're up and clear. 49   EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - UNMARKED CAR \nmoves into the central city. 50   POV THROUGH CAR WINDOWS - STREETS - MOVING \nBad-looking hombres on stoops, street corners. NICO (O.S.) I promised the Lieutenant, I'm gonna take care of you. Broken windows and lost kittens for your last week. WIDEN SHOT to include Nico and Jackson. \nJACKSON And then you're gonna come visit me in a nice, clean, air conditioned office -- \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          14. \n51   EXT. STREET - BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                        * The unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar. \n52   INT. UNMARKED CAR as it parks. Jackson gives Nico a look:     \"What are we stopping at this dive for\"? \nNICO I gotta take a quick leak. Stay put. \nHe gets out of the car, starts for the bar. 53   INT. BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                                 * \nDim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar.    Nico enters. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                            15. \nHis silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working- class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head. \nBAD DUDE                                 * Why the fuck don't you assholes                        * leave me alone?                                        * \nHe continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool,     * then another; the same exchange is repeated. 54   FAVOR ONE PARTICULARLY TOUGH CUSTOMER                           * \nA hulking bruiser with an earring.   He watches as -- 55   NICO \napproaches him. Three ARMY JACKETS look up sullenly. Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches. NICO Gentlemen. One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose. FIRST ARMY JACKET (to others) I thought this was a kosher bar. They didn't allow no pork in here. The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar. Nico holds out a photo of a young girl (Lucy). NICO You seen this girl? SECOND ARMY JACKET I seen the top of her head. NICO That's witty. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                        15A. \nNico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next stool. From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          * sawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move         * ominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move     * almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right out of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash. Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks like his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk shirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with a shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening into the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has been put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its feet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six. Seven. Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat- tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men -- \nNICO Come on.   Show me something. No one moves. \nLUCY Let him alone! He's beautiful! \nNICO Not when I get through with him. Nico lifts the Pimp by the throat, pins him to the wall. \nPIMP No, man, wait! I'll give you something! Something big! \nLUCY Please, Nico!    Don't! PIMP It's huge! I swear it! A shipment... coming in next Tuesday -- NICO Shipment, my ass. PIMP This is square! On my mother's soul! You can't send me up -- Nico glances to Lucy. Half of him wants to tear the Pimp apart, the other half doesn't want to make the poor girl's life any more tragic. Besides, he's a good cop -- and maybe this \"shipment\" is on the level. PIMP I heard it from a hooker friend of mine. She's banging some big coke lawyer, he told her. I swear to Jesus! \nNico relents -- a little. NICO What lawyer? \nPIMP I don't know. (sees Nico doesn't believe him) That platinum chola... Carla DeCarlo... she knows. Nico tightens his grip on the Pimp's throat. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          19.   * \nPIMP She got popped this afternoon. She's downtown. Red dress, lizard shoes -- \n60   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BAR - DAY Jackson looks up from the car to see Nico -- wild-haired, shirt ripped and bloody -- emerging from the adjacent apartment stoop, leading young Lucy, who's tear-streaked, wearing a torn dressing gown. Instantly, Jackson is out of the car, moving to Lucy. \nJACKSON It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is here. \nShe wraps an arm around Lucy, helps her toward the car. \nJACKSON (to Nico) That was some leak you took. From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek. JACKSON Broken windows and lost pussy cats, huh. Jackson checks out her battered partner. \nJACKSON You're one crazy bastard, Toscani. Nico opens the rear door, helps Jackson ease Lucy in. \nNICO We'll get her some clothes and a bath. I'm not bringing her home to her grandmother like this. DISSOLVE TO: \n61   OMITTED \n63   EXT. ZINGARO BAKERY - DAY \nFrom the front seat of Nico's car emerges a tearful Lucy, in fresh clothes and looking miserably contrite. Nico walks her inside. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         20.       * \nThe Zingaro family is busy preparing for the night's baking. Grandpa and Grandma Zingaro leave their work and receive their waif-like granddaughter. With eyes watering they thank Nico. They disappear upstairs with Lucy. Jackson, standing in the doorway, has seen all this. 64   INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY \nNico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery. Jackson, in the passenger seat, studies her partner for a few moments, shaking her head at the contradictions in this man. Educated, classy, an elegant dresser -- yet underneath an out-and-out wild man. \nJACKSON I don't get you, Toscani. (beat) What the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop? With your background? For a long moment Nico says nothing.   Then, quietly, look- ing straight ahead: NICO When I was overseas, I saw some things. Things that eat your guts out. Things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded. He turns to Jackson. NICO You can walk away from them, Jax. You can quit, but you know it's still going on. You try something anyway -- (smiles a moment) -- I know I'm not going to change the world. I can't stop the tonnage coming in, I can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons -- \nANGLE INCLUDING MEAN STREETS OUTSIDE NICO But maybe here, huh? (indicates street) Maybe in my own city, my own neighborhood, on my own block -- maybe here I can do something. \nHe turns a corner. NICO That's why I'm a shitheel cop. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         20A.     * \n64A   INT. POLICE STATION - DAY Behind the desk, a few detectives man the phones.   A Latin attorney, ABANDANO, is at the counter. \nCHI CHI You were right, cabron.                            * \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                           24. \nOne SHOT between the eyes and Nardo CRASHES backward into the WINE RACK, eyes wide with shock and bewilderment. Chi Chi SHOOTS him AGAIN; Nardo drops like a stone. Coolly, professionally, Chi Chi pumps FOUR more SHOTS into the prone busboy's head. Chi Chi ejects the clip into his palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. Salvano appears at the top of the stairs. Two busboys are behind him. One of them is the young pimp. The busboys hurry        * down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool. * Salvano comes down the stairs. Chi Chi stands over his work. SALVANO (to busboys) Clean up this mess. CHI CHI                                  * Who knows who else is talking --                       * \nSALVANO                                  * He was a young fool.                                   * 76   BACK IN UPSTAIRS DINING ROOM Salvano and Chi Chi emerge from the basement steps and walk toward their booth. \nCHI CHI We're crazy waiting for this bullshit 'shipment.' Let me waste the other fucker now. \nSalvano puts a hand on Chi Chi's shoulder. SALVANO Be patient. This will be done the way it was planned. CUT TO: \n77   EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - NIGHT Rusting cyclone fences surround   a mud-lot repair yard in a dingy industrial section. Young    Lation and black workers finish up for the night; through   the dirty, security-barred office window we can see Chi Chi   talking on the phone. The lawyer, Abandano, is also there. \n78   EXT. ALLEY - REAR OF SHOP - NIGHT \nNico finishes connecting a small transmitter which has been hastily wired to the entering phone line. \n79   INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT \nNico and Jackson in the shadows down the street from the body shop. Nico wears earphones, a small tape recorder on the seat beside him. Jackson does not look happy. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          25. \nJACKSON Toscani, you're going to have me doing time. \nNICO Lighten up, Jax. No one's bringing this into court. \nJACKSON Except against us. NICO I don't give a shit how we do it. I just wanna get there. Jackson gives Nico a dirty look, but stifles her protest. \nJACKSON I thought you said you were gonna protect me. Cover my butt. Be my guardian angel -- Nico hears something through the earphones.    Gestures for silence -- 80   ANGLE THROUGH OFFICE WINDOW Chi Chi listens with increased intensity to something on the phone. He starts writing it down -- 81   BACK TO NICO In unmarked car.   He's writing it down too. NICO I got the shipment.                                  * JACKSON What?    What's he saying? \nNICO (scribbling furiously) '... Engine block has cleared customs. Serial number VA-748. Pick up Tuesday, 3 May as authorized.' \n82   EXT. BODY SHOP - NIGHT \nChi Chi emerges from the office, tucking a scrap of paper into his pocket. Abandano follows. They get into a late-model Lincoln which pulls out onto the street.     * \n83   EXT. STREET - NIGHT Nico and Jackson's car follows at a discreet distance. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                           26. \nNICO (V.O.) Unit Ten Tango X-ray. I need a vehicle registration I.D. \nPOLICE RADIO (V.O.) Go ahead, please. NICO (V.O.) '86 Lincoln.    Illinois 354 Dog '67.                * \n84   INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - NIGHT Jackson picks up Nico's pad to take down the response. After a moment: POLICE RADIO (V.O.) Vehicle registration follows. Leaseholder: Ramon Testamente, registered alien. Nation of origin: Venezuela. Do you wish criminal record search? NICO (into mike) I want to know when he wipes his                     * behind.                                              * 85   SERIES OF SHOTS As Nico and Jackson tail the Lincoln out of the industrial zone into a fancier, non-Latin neighborhood. On the sidewalks we glimpse theatergoers, fashionable white couples out on the town. 86   LINCOLN \nPulls up to a valet park outside a ton-y restaurant.    A sign says: \"BOGOTA.\"                                           * \nemerges from a corner, two blocks down.    It starts slowly this way. \n1ST WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.) All right. Everyone get their heads outa their ass. \nThe meat truck men duck down out of sight, the pickup men back into the shadows. Nico and Lukich keep raking cow guts. The van passes slowly, checking out the area. JACKSON (sarcastic) '... And so I quit the police department... got myself a steady job -- ' The van accelerates slightly, turns a corner, vanishes. Silence. LUKICH                                * They spotted me. I'm too good- looking to be a meat slopper.                       * 1ST WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.) Will you hot dogs shut up? The van returns.   On a cross street.   Heading behind the packing plant. \nNICO                                  * (to Lukich)                                  * You're too ugly. \nNow a second car appears. The Lincoln. Behind it is an ancient station wagon. Both vehicles take a different cross street, but both heading behind the packing plant. \nNICO (into hidden mike) Here we go, boys and girls -- (to Jackson) You stay put.                                       * \nAs soon as the two vehicles pass out of sight, Nico and Lukich ditch their rakes, dart into the packing plant. The meat truck men START their TRUCK. \nThe pickup men board their vehicle -- Jackson follows Nico and Luke -- but at a safe distance. \n100   INT. PACKING PLANT - DAY \nNico and Lukich sprint in a crouch past the blood runoffs, meat cutting tables -- \n101   NICO'S POV - RUNNING \nTHROUGH the windows at the rear of the plant, we see the station wagon and the van, pulling up swiftly beside one another, men getting out -- \n102   INT. PLANT Nico and Lukich draw their guns, running full-tilt. \nNICO (into hidden miki) It's going down now. Move! 103   EXT. REAR OF PACKING PLANT - DAY The station wagon men heave their rear door open, the van men start to open their side door. The Lincoln is stopped at a distance. Suddenly -- 104   NICO AND LUKICH burst from the rear door of the packing plant, guns drawn. LUKICH Police! 105   QUICK CUTS - VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN grab for their weapons -- \n106   COPS IN MEAT TRUCK AND PICKUP come highballing around both sides of the packing plant -- \n107   VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN OPEN FIRE. There is confusion and mayhem; it's not clear who's a cop and who's a criminal. \n108   NICO AND LUKICH dive for cover, RETURNING FIRE. The DEA men in one truck also OPEN UP. One of the van men is hit between the eyes. MACHINE GUN FIRE rakes the DEA truck; it spins out of control; flips. Lukich SHOOTS the machine-gunner. LUKICH (shouts; points) Nico!   The Lincoln! \n109   LINCOLN starts to PEEL OUT. We glimpse Chi Chi in the driver's seat, Salvano on the passenger side. \n110   NICO steps in front of the accelerating Lincoln, raises his .45. \n111   INT. LINCOLN - DAY Salvano and Chi Chi dive below the dash and continue forward. Salvano, in the passenger seat, raises his GUN; FIRES blindly -- trying to hit Nico. 112   EXT. LINCOLN - DAY \nNico UNLOADS his .45 into the windshield and the firewall. The Lincoln keeps coming down the narrow alley. 113   NICO brazenly steps up onto the hood and dives, grabbing onto the roof. 114   INT. LINCOLN - DAY Salvano can't believe it. He screams something in Spanish. He FIRES again, this time through the roof. 115   EXT. LINCOLN - ROOF - DAY Bullet holes appear.    Nico narrowly misses being hit. 116   ANOTHER ANGLE - LINCOLN \nNico reaches over the side of the car and SMASHES the pas- senger WINDOW with his fist. \n117   CLOSEUP - NICO'S HAND Salvano's face is bashed.     Nico's huge hand grabs Salvano's throat; he won't let go. \n118   CLOSEUP - NICO He hangs on with one hand. \n119   CLOSEUP - SALVANO Nico's fingers now    dig into Salvano's larynx; he may never talk again. He's     gagging. Salvano now points the gun at Chi Chi. Chi Chi     makes the decision to stop the car in order to save his    boss. \nHe speaks to the officers. AGENT NEELEY                            * What I'm about to say doesn't leave this room. Is that clear? Assent from everyone. \nAGENT NEELEY                            * Mr. Salvano has been working for some time in cooperation with certain federal agencies. \n134   CLOSE - NICO'S FACE Stunned and furious at this royal fuck-up. AGENT NEELEY (O.S.)                     * I'm not at liberty to divulge the nature of Mr. Salvano's involvement -- I just learned of its existence myself a few hours ago. But one thing I can tell you -- 135   BACK TO AGENT NEELEY                                            * \nAGENT NEELEY                            * Mr. Salvano's role is crucial to an extremely sensitive ongoing investigation. Any further surveillance, harassment, or unauthorized operations against this individual are forbidden. I must order you gentlemen -- (looking straight at Nico) -- with all respect for your work and your courage, to stand down. \nLukich shakes his head; Nico is devastated.     Jackson takes it all in. \nCUT TO: \n136   INT. POLICE SQUAD ROOM - MORNING OPENING CLOSE ON a desk drawer being opened. Aside from rounds of ammo, notes and an aging eggplant parmigiana sandwich, there are half a dozen hand-labeled audio- cassettes and a small collection of miniaturized bugging devices. Jackson and Lukich watch Nico take out the notes, hand them to Lieutenant Strozah. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                         35. \nLIEUTENANT STROZAH The tapes too. \nNICO (mocking) That's my Lawrence Welk collection! \nLIEUTENANT STROZAH I want everything you got on this one. Reluctantly, Nico hands over the tapes.   The Lieutenant eyes the bugs and wires. LIEUTENANT STROZAH I know you don't give a shit about yourself, Toscani. (a glance to Jax) But you're gonna put Jackson's ass in a sling, too, with these illegal wires. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         35A.    * \n136A   OTHER SIDE OF SQUAD ROOM Agent Halloran edges up to Jackson, who's grabbing coffee on the far side of the squad room, and watching from there as Nico gives Strozah more of a hard time. AGENT HALLORAN What's the story on your partner, Jackson? Did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his ass? Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite herself, there's a certain rapport. JACKSON He has ethics. Unlike certain others on this case. \nHalloran watches the illegal bugs and tapes come out of Nico's drawer. AGENT HALLORAN His 'ethics' are gonna cost him his badge and his gun. \nThis \"white\" talk gives Jackson a pain.   She slips into her jive mode. JACKSON You don't wanna catch him without no gun. Halloran's look asks why not? JACKSON 'Cause what he do with his hands... make bullet holes look pretty. \nAcross the room, Nico turns over the tapes. AGENT HALLORAN He bad? \nJACKSON Bad bad. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          36. \n137   INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY Nico and Jackson come down the stairs. Jackson has had ample excitement for her last week on the force. \nJACKSON Is that enough? Can we do something normal now -- like eat lunch? \nNICO Anything you say, Jax.   How about Salvano's? \nJACKSON Let it be, Nico. \n138   EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DAY \nNico and Jackson's car pulls out into traffic. 139   INT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED (ALLEY BEHIND SALVANO'S) Jackson and Nico are eating some fast good.   Nico reaches to his jacket pocket; takes out a cassette. \nJACKSON What... you kept his tape, too? Nico already has it in the PLAYER. We hear FRAGMENTS of the telephone tap from the body shop in Spanish and English. Jackson looks frustrated. Nico listens care- fully to what appears to be the taped PHONE CONVERSATION. NICO Poetry, ain't it? 140   EXT. REAR SALVANO'S RESTAURANT - DAY (POV FROM CAR) \nFATHER GENARRO Two nights ago. I didn't call the police. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                        39.         * \nFather Genarro knocks on the door, pauses, then knocks again. The door opens. A twelve-year-old who looks like he's from Central America stands in the doorway. \nFATHER GENARRO (in Spanish) It's all right, son. These are friends. \nThe boy steps back and we MOVE INTO -- 154   INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY \nA largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up. Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner, various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly -- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson. Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again. FATHER GENARRO (referring to the cops) These are friends. (to Nico) This is Father Tomassino. \nFATHER TOMASSINO How do you do? Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave. 155   NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO \ncontinue down the hall. JACKSON I didn't know this church was a sanctuary, Father. FATHER GENARRO Yes. But, perhaps not such a safe one. NICO How long have they been here? \nFATHER GENARRO Too long. At least the kids can go to our school. \nNICO Who did it, Father? \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                 39A. \nFATHER GENARRO Kids, maybe. (significantly) Maybe worse. It's not the first time. JACKSON We can have a car check by, every hour. \nFATHER GENARRO No... please.    Police frighten these people. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          40. \n156   INT. CHURCH - MAIN AISLE - DAY                              * The three are outside, taking their leave. A big smile and a hand on Father Genarro's shoulder. The priest is greatly relieved. NICO Really, I don't mind coming by. \nFATHER GENARRO Tell me, Nico... When was your last confession? \nNICO I'm a married man, Father.   I've got no sins to confess. \nFATHER GENARRO You're a police officer, you have many sins to confess. JACKSON Amen. Nico and Jackson start off. \nFATHER GENARRO (calls after Nico) You come back Sunday. I feel better when I see Nicola in church. (calls louder) You don't show, I'm phoning your mother! DISSOLVE TO: 157   SAME CHURCH - POV FROM WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (SUNDAY) \nHIGH ANGLE FROM ACROSS the street: neighborhood people dressed in their Sunday best fill the sidewalk, filing in for Mass. We hear an ORGAN from inside the church. \n158   VARIOUS ANGLES - CONGREGATION An Italian neighborhood becoming more Hispanic. As the churchgoers file in, we see families -- women, kids, babies. \n159   NICO, SARA, ROSA AND JULIAN                                 * are among the crowd, exchanging pleasantries with friends and neighbors -- in English, Italian and Spanish. \n160   INT. CHURCH - SIDE AISLE Sara, holding Julian, slips into a pew. As Nico and Rosa    * follow, Father Genarro passes, heading for the front. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                             41. \nROSA Father Genarro! I have you to thank for getting my son back into church! \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           43. \nROSA (in Italian) Help the others! Help them, Nico! \nCUT TO: 173   STATUE OF JESUS \nSplattered with real blood. \nCUT BACK TO: 174   ANGLE ON CONGREGATION \nEveryone is down, reeling from the concussion, dust and smoke. Nico rises alone from this scene. \nNICO (forcefully) Help each other move outside.   Be calm. 175   EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - MORNING From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth. We hear SCREAMS from inside. 176   INT. CHURCH Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church- goer. NICO Call 911. Tell 'em to send everything they got! (turns to his wife) Sara, get the baby and Mama                        * outside. Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst. \n177   EXT. FRONT OF CHURCH - MORNING The congregation streams out in terror-stricken disarray. We see Nico's family -- they're all right. \n178   NICO appears from the church, carrying a young choir girl. He hands the child over to two older women, races back into the church. \n179   LONG SHOT - STREET OUTSIDE CHURCH The first paramedic van comes speeding around the corner, SIREN BLARING. Police cars appear right behind -- \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                            44. \n180   INT. CHURCH Nico appears through the backlit smoke and kneels over the bloodied body of Father Genarro. He desperately tries to maintain the priest's life. CUT TO: \n181   INT. HOSPITAL/ICU WARD - AFTERNOON \nThe aftermath of the blast. Doctors and nurses have the scene more of less under control, but there's still plenty of pain and misery. \n182   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON Nico stands, his back to the wall -- a scary, blank look on his face. A doctor and several nurses are pulling the plugs on the terribly mutilated body of Father Genarro. A nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father. 183   JACKSON arrives.   Nico talks to her, aside. NICO I want a list of everyone that's been treated here today. Everyone. JACKSON Right. NICO Then find those sanctuary people, the ones we saw in the church basement -- As Jackson makes notes. \nNICO Find out where they're from, why anyone would want to harm them. \nJackson flips her notepad shut, ready to go. JACKSON Where are you gonna be? \nNICO Just stay near a radio.   I'll find you. \n184   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NICO'S MOTHER (ROSA) - AFTERNOON \nSits on a bench with a bandage over one eye. Sara             * and Julian are sleeping beside her. Nico kneels beside his mother, deeply concerned. Nico takes his mother's arm, helps her to her feet. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        45. \nSara wakes and picks up Julian. Mama knows Father Genarro     * has died. She begins sobbing softly. Other members of the congregation are in the hallway, mourning. Nico, with his family, takes several steps toward the exit. Suddenly, Nico stops. He sees Agent Neeley entering (the FBI man who    * ordered him off the case) accompanied by Lieutenant Strozah   * and two uniformed officers. \nNICO Sara... go down to the car; I'll                    * be with you in a minute. He hails Neeley.                                              * \nNICO I need to talk to you. (a glance to Strozah and others) ... Alone. Neeley nods. Nico leads him off the corridor, through a       * fire exit door -- 185   STAIRWELL LANDING The door closes behind them. Nico and the FBI man are alone on the stairway landing. AGENT NEELEY                          * (impatient) What the hell is it, Toscani? Without warning, Nico grabs Neeley by both lapels, slams      * him furiously into the wall! NICO You.   That's what the hell it is! AGENT NEELEY                          * Get your goddam hands off me! Neeley tries to shake free; Nico won't let him.               * \nNICO You let Salvano walk. AGENT NEELEY                          * Salvano?! Are you crazy? (rips himself free) What does he have to do with this? NICO That was no cherry bomb in there. That was C-fucking-4! (struggles to master his rage) I've used that shit. (MORE) \nFIRST GIRL Fly, baby! 194   NICO \ntears after this human cannonball.   Amazingly, he's gaining -- 195   INT. BODEGA - DAY \nMachete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past -- \n196   EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard, which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side -- 197   BACK TO NICCO pursuing along the same route. 198   MACHETE MAN \nclaws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame- work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a- bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico, starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours. Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously. Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad- jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by- fours, which give way, sending them plunging into -- \n199   BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright. \nMACHETE MAN (to Nico, in terror) No, hermano. Please -- \nNico starts menacingly toward the hood, breathing hard from the chase. \nNICO Who put up the money? MACHETE MAN What money? \nNico grabs him by the hair. NICO You didn't come after me for a piece of ass. (twists the youth's neck) Who paid you? \nMACHETE MAN I told ya!    No one! Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare. NICO (shouting) Shut up! The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see that Nico can break his elbow with one blow. NICO Give it to me! Nico raises his fist to strike. \nMACHETE MAN Jimmy Constanza! Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's wallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a- part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means. \nNICO If you're lying to me, I'll come and kill you right in your own fucking kitchen. \nNico dumps him on the ground and walks away.    Instantly Machete Man changes his tune. MACHETE MAN Salvano!   Bautista Salvano! \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                            52. \nNico walks back, his foot smashes into the punk's face. He hits the ground with a thud. \nNICO Gracias, muchacho. Nico walks away. \n200   MONTAGE WITH SCORE \nA)   INT. NICO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Nico at the kitchen table spread with notepads, old add- ress books, 3X5 cards. He's on the phone, impatient, apparently getting nowhere. He slams the phone down. B)   INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nNico paces, phone cradled to ear, talking urgently. CLICK: he's been hung up on; he looks at the receiver in frustration and disgust. C)   CLOSE - CORKBOARD ON KITCHEN WALL Nico's hands pushpin a 3X5 card into the wall. \nD)   INSERT - 3X5 CARD We read: \"FBI / Agent Smith / 11:53 / B.S. / Covering for who?\" \nE)   KITCHEN - NIGHT Nico back at the table, listening to the wiretap tape, transcribing it. \nF)   ANOTHER ANGLE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER) Nico holds Julian, goes over notes. \nG)   CLOSE - YELLOW LEGAL PAD The page is headed: \"FATHER GENARRO.\" Below in doodle formation, are a series of boxes, each one containing a phrase. We read: \"Father G had some- thing on Salvano?\" \"Church break-in?\" \"Drug infor- mation?\" \"Father G connected to FBI?\" Irritably, Nico's pencil crosses everything out. \n201   SARA                                                            * Appears in a nightgown at the kitchen doorway.   She looks frail, frightened. MUSIC ENDS. \nNICO (to Sara,                                      * allowing himself to be frisked) It's all a mistake, Sara -- It's                      * gonna be all right. The cops steer Nico toward the door. \nSARA                                    * (calls after them) The Police Association's got lawyers for this, you bastards! \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                            57. \nSara grabs for the phone; Nico is manhandled out the            * door -- \n212   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nThe neighbors are now on their porches.   Nico is led to a waiting unmarked car. \nCUT TO: \n213   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - LATE NIGHT Bad Dude, the bartender we remember from Nico's first visit to the Polish bar, finishes signing a deposition. A cop takes the paper. Bad Dude stands, glances half- fearfully, half-defiantly to Nico, who is led down a hall- way flanked by two uniformed officers. Agent Halloran opens the door for Bad Dude, who exits. \n214   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATE NIGHT Neeley, Halloran, Lieutenant Strozah and Deputy Superinten-     * dent JACK CROWDER. Halloran indicates a stack of                * depositions, tapes and notes on the table before Nico. AGENT HALLORAN Illegal wiretaps. Unauthorized surveillance. NICO When were you born, asshole? AGENT NEELEY                             * Associating with known felons. Disobeying direct orders -- \nNICO Where's Jackson? \nCROWDER                                  * She's outa this. AGENT HALLORAN You're the rotten apple in this barrel, Toscani. We don't have to look any farther than you and your 'family.' \nNico comes out of his chair, going for Halloran.      Strozah tries to block him, but it's useless. LIEUTENANT STROZAH                       * Nico! You damn fool! You wanna go to prison?! Nico stops. He's speechless with rage.    His finger points toward Halloran like a loaded gun. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           58. \nCROWDER                               * (indicates more depositions) Unlawful entry. Illegal search and seizure -- NICO (spits on papers) You'll never build a frame on this chickenshit. AGENT NEELEY                          * (angrily) You were ordered to back off on Salvano. But you had too big a hard-on for that, didn't you-- \nNico contains his fury. He steps away from Strozah, with a gesture that says \"I won't hurt you.\" NICO (to Strozah) Fred.   You can't be in on this. Nico faces his lieutenant -- a look that calls on long       * years of comradeship and loyalty. Strozah is torn. He's a good man, over his head in a situation he doesn't com- pletely understand. LIEUTENANT STROZAH                    * You're officially suspended, Toscani. I want your tin... and your iron. Neeley leans past Nico; drops Nico's gun (with an evidence   * tag on it) onto the table. Nico looks to Strozah, who averts his eyes. Nico flips his badge onto the table. NICO You holding me? \nAGENT NEELEY                          * You can walk for now. But don't walk far. \nCUT TO: 215   EXT. PHONE BOOTH ON DOWNTOWN STREET - DAWN \nWe are outside of a cop breakfast hangout. Several police cars are parked in the lot. Nico is on the phone. NICO Sara, I'm okay.

JACKSON I'm not a rookie, Toscani. Now, go home. Get your family out of here. Nico agrees.    The pair starts to split. \nNICO (calls after Jackson) Just paperwork, you understand? \nCUT TO: 219   INT. NICO'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING Nico drives, a jumble of emotions on his face.      Urgency fear, exhaustion. He's deep in thought -- \n220   EXT. INTERSECTION - MORNING Nico's car pulls up at a stop light. He looks around without really seeing. An old lady pulls a shopping cart       * while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street.      * 221   ANOTHER CAR ROARS up out of nowhere, without two men inside, SCREECH- ING to a stop head-on to Nico's door. Its doors spring open -- 222   NICO \ndives toward his own passenger door -- 223   SECOND CAR - TWO MORE ARMED MEN \nleap out, OPEN FIRE with pistols and automatic weapons. 224   QUICK CUTS \nNico's car riddled with a furious FUSILLADE.      WINDOWS BLOW OUT; the driver's door is shredded -- \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          64. \n225   NICO - ON FLOORBOARD crawling frantically; shoving the passenger door open as a FIRESTORM of lead and FLYING GLASS BLAZES all around him. 226   FOUR MEN \nFIRING point blank (6 to ten feet) into Nico's car.   The men are cool, professional. 227   NICO \nspills from the passenger door onto the ground, scrambles like mad under his own car toward one of the attackers' cars. 228   PEDESTRIANS AROUND INTERSECTION \nscream and scatter in terror. 229   FOUR MEN FIRING as shells spew from the ejection ports of their weapons. 230   NICO'S CAR being chewed to pieces -- 231   NICO - UNDER MEN'S CAR                                          * \ncrawling at full speed from the car's front to its back. On the ground, alongside the car, spent CARTRIDGE CASES RAIN like hailstones. 232   FOUR MEN As their magazines empty. The last shells spring free, GUN BARRELS SIZZLE, blue smoke fills the air. The leader waves two men forward to check their kill. At that instant: 233   NICO \nsprings to his feet behind the men, the Sig Saur .45            * clutched in both hands. (He has crawled under both cars to envelop his attackers.) \nNICO Over here, you sons-a-bitches! Nico's rage is superhuman. The men stare in conster- nation. One of the men has a fresh magazine half into his weapon -- \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        65. \nNICO (eyes like an animal) Try it. Be my guest. \nThe man lets the magazine clatter to the street. The others raise their hands. It takes all Nico's strength to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot. His gaze swings wildly around the intersection. He spots a corner grocery store. A phone inside. NICO (gestures with gun) Over there! Move it! -- Now!! The men are scared shitless. They put their hands in back of their heads; trot jelly-legged -- \n234   INT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - DAY A Pakistani counter clerk takes one look at the mob enter- ing his store and bolts for the rear. A customer exits as Nico herds his captives in. NICO Hands on the counter! Three men do it; the fourth is slow. NICO Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE -- The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re-         * ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet. One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker -- \n235   POV FROM OUTSIDE STORE \nIt looks like a tornado has hit the interior.

Dr. Watanabe (Nico's friend whom we remember from the baptism/picnic scene) is the chief engineer at the booth, showing off some high-tech equipment to several brainy looking executives. Watanabe glances up, spots Nico. Nico makes a subtle sign to indicate he must speak to Watanabe. Watanabe crosses at once to Nico. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           73A. \nWATANABE So good to see you again, sir!

Carpeted office dividers set off a small area, packed with super sophisticated computer equipment. \nWatanabe \"boots up\" a terminal, sits down with relish. WATANABE The last six years I've been risking nothing but money. It's a kick to risk my ass again. \nNico eyes the equipment and Watanabe, impressed. \nNICO The old Spook.

Guests and valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in clusters, clawing and scrambling over each other for safety. ZAGON (to first agent, advancing) Move! Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the garage ramp, toward the lower levels. His path puts the first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire.

Or Harrison's dead aide. (as Neeley fumbles with                          * his laces) Hurry up! (as Neeley obeys)                                * You heard the radio.

You assholes are missing half the case! \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                         72. \nDespite his animosity toward Nico, Neeley is beginning to     * realize this cop is onto something. \nAGENT NEELEY                       * Listen.

A towering * marquee sign reads: \"COMPUTER EXPO '87.\" Nico starts on foot toward the convention center entrance. \nD)   INT. CONDO APARTMENT - DAY Jackson enters, looking guilty as hell. She picks up a framed photo from a piano: the dead Senator's aide posed smiling beside a distinguished-looking man (Senator Harrison) in front of the capitol building. Jackson sets the photo down, starts rummaging through desk drawers. \nE)   INT.

CONVENTION CENTER Nico, in the crush of convention-goers, pauses before a booth promoting a TV manufacturer. The latest model TV's are set up in a sales display, with visitors gawking at the pictures of the church bombing aftermath. NEWSWOMAN (V.O.) (on TV's) Police sources also speculate that Toscani may be connected to the suspect in the bombing of St. Elizabeth's parish church -- \nA police composite rendering of the woman who placed the bomb at the church is shown on the television. \nNEWSWOMAN (V.O.) (on TV's) -- the suspect is likely to be armed and considered to be extremely dangerous -- Nico's police ID photo appears on the news.

NICO (in pain) Don't push me like this -- Her eyes meet his -- loving, but desperate. \nSARA Branca can put us on a plane -- but where can we fly to? Tibet? The moon? There's nowhere they can't find us. \nNICO You don't know what the hell you're talking about. SARA I'm talking about everything I've learned from you in the past five years. \nNico is in agony. NICO You know I can't go to him. Sara takes both his hands in hers. \nSARA Do you know why I love you? Do you know what it is about you that I've always loved? (as Nico fights his own emotion) Pride. It's what you have inside. You don't live the way other people live. You trust what you see as right and won't let anyone or anything make you stray from it. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           88A.      * \nMOVE IN PAST Sara TO Nico's face.

CUT TO: \n340   CLOSE - NICO - AGAINST WALL - DAY He wears a suit and tie, a hat.   All business. MAN (O.S.) Is this the attorney? ANOTHER MAN (O.S.) You can come now, Mr. Carlucci. O.S. we hear a METALLIC sound BEGIN, VERY CLOSE -- PULL BACK TO: \n341   ANOTHER ANGLE To reveal bars which slide electrically to the side.    A prison door opens, letting him through. \n342   ANGLE - PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY Nico, escorted by a prison guard, walks down a long, blank hallway. CUT TO: \n343   NICO Waiting in a barren reception room.   Several benches, tables; heavy steel mesh over windows -- \n344   NICO'S POV - ACROSS ROOM A steel door opens on the far side. Out steps a small Italian man in his seventies, wearing the faded denim of an inmate. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                         88B-90. \n345   INT.

Behind them, a discreet fifteen paces, walk     * two armed prison officials. 346   CLOSER - LARUSSO AND NICO \nThe old man never looks directly at Nico, yet we sense keenly that he is taking the younger man's measure. FREDERICO LARUSSO I am only an old man. An old man with a cancer. The two are like an old and a young lion, appraising each other -- using all five senses and more. \nNICO I don't have much time, Uncle.    So I must speak plainly. Larusso listens.   Nico waits for a beat.   Then: \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          91. \nNICO (this is very painful for him) -- For as long as I've been old enough to think, I've hated you and hated everything you stood for. Larusso takes this in without a flicker. \nNICO I was so sure that you and I were on opposite sides of the fence... and that you and your people were destroying this country -- Nico pauses, glances away across the grounds. \n", "test2_true": "continue across the grounds. FREDERICO LARUSSO I will be    candid with you. I knew, probably    before you did, that you would be    coming to me. I knew what you would    ask... and I had every intention    of refusing you. \nHe glances to Nico. FREDERICO LARUSSO But it is a form of wisdom to know when to cease relying only upon yourself. \nHe keeps walking. \nFREDERICO LARUSSO You know, of course, that this Senator Harrison will never live to make his speech tomorrow.

(beat) 'Ecce non uomine, ecce bestie.' You know Dante? (translates) 'These are not men, these are animals.' \nLarusso stops, takes a small note pad from his pocket.         He quickly scribbles a few lines. FREDERICO LARUSSO Memorize this address. \nHe holds the paper for Nico to see. FREDERICO LARUSSO Have you got it in your mind? Nico nods.    Larusso tears the paper into tiny shreds.             * \n349   INT. ADMIN BUILDING - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY The old man takes his leave of Nico with a warm, if formal handshake. The guards stand by, waiting. \nFREDERICO LARUSSO Thank you, Mr. Carlucci. I trust you will give my love to my niece, Rosa. NICO I will do that, Mr. Larusso. (sincerely) I hope you will be well. \n350   LARUSSO nods: \"Bene.\" Then: without a word he turns and exits back through the steel door. CUT TO: \n351   INT. O'HARE AIRPORT - BOARDING GATE - DAY \nPassengers file aboard a flight to Toronto. Hugs, goodbyes. Rosa, carrying the baby, is among the crowd moving toward the boarding door. Leaving with them are two of Branca's men. We PICK OUT Branca and two of his bodyguards near the fringes, looking inobtrusive but definitely on guard. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           92A/93. \n352   CORNER NEAR BRANCA Hidden by a bank of phones, Sara clings to Nico, holding      * him as tight as she can. When she releases him, we can't hear what she says, but it seems like, \"Be careful, please be careful.\" Nico glances to Branca, who motions subtly to hurry. \nHe squeezes Sara's hand, she joins the crowd swelling            * toward the boarding door -- CUT TO: \n353   EXT. O'HARE - RUNWAY - DAY (STOCK)                               * An Air Canada PLANE BLASTS skyward. \n354   NICO AND BRANCA \nwatch from an open corner of a parking lot. As the plane begins its bank to gain altitude, Branca turns to Nico. The two bodybuards keep a discreet watch nearby. BRANCA You got the architect's drawings? Wiring, floor plans -- Nico indicates a briefcase he is carrying. NICO It's all here. Nico turns to his uncle.    Regards him with affection. BRANCA I could help you from here on. NICO It's not your business. \nNico embraces his uncle by both shoulders. NICO Grazie, tio caro. Branca pats Nico's cheek. \nBRANCA Take care of yourself, Nicola. CUT TO: \n355   SERIES OF SHOTS \nSEVERAL SHOTS of high-rise cityscapes at night. DISSOLVE TO: \n", "test3_input": "405   NICO in a metal chair, wrists taped in front of him. One agent stands behind him, clasping a thin cable noose wrapped tight around Nico's throat. Shotgun agent holds his weapon on him, its twin muzzles inches from Nico's skull. 406   ZAGON \nfinishes washing his hands in an industrial-type sink. He is cleaned up, wearing a fresh shirt, his hair combed. When he dries his hands, he looks like a surgeon preparing to operate. \nZAGON We've got an hour before the honorable senator. (hands towel to pistol agent) You've got to learn to take time, smell the roses. \nZagon turns to Nico. NICO How are you gonna do him, Zagon? In a motorcade? Or passing through a hotel kitchen? The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch. Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter- rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes, scalpels, surgical tools. \nZAGON I've used these little beauties many times to extract information -- (lifts a needle to the light) -- This'll be the first time I've ever used them... just for fun. \nZagon sets the syringe down, slips on a heavy, weighted glove. ZAGON (to agents) Take his arms. Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side,         * seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon tight to Nico's head. \nZagon punches Nico square in the face, so hard the chair reels backward, spinning out from under Nico -- \nZAGON Hold him up! Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes with defiance. \nZAGON This is where you came in, Toscani. Only, now it's where you're gonna check out. He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon injects Nico. \n407   NICO reacts instantly to the hypo -- cursing, sputtering under the choking noose. He twists wildly trying to free him- self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him. ZAGON That's it. Fight it, cherry. Fight it, so it speeds faster on its way -- Nico struggles more violently. \nZAGON Fight it. Till the vessels burst in your brain. Till the arteries rupture in your heart -- \nSlowly, the struggle goes out of Nico. His muscles go limp; he slumps -- drooling, babbling incoherently. \nZAGON That's my boy. That's what I was waiting for -- Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer, gloating, cooing -- \nZAGON A fool learns from his own mistakes. But a wise man learns from the mistakes of others -- (moves closer, blade in hand) You should have killed me when you had the chance, Toscani -- \nThe blade moves to Nico's throat. Suddenly: Nico springs to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him ferociously into the wall! Zagon drops to the floor, half-conscious. Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot- gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's face, about to pull the trigger. Nico sidesteps, grabbing the man's wrist. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall. The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder holster. Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon, spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in! Another swing wipes out Pistol agent. Bad Dude, now with a clear shot, aims his M-16. Nico blows him away with a double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST. In a flash, Nico has spun to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. He yanks the choke cable off his neck -- \n408   ZAGON - AGAINST WALL On his feet again. He reaches swiftly to the floor, snatches up his famous knife. Nico confronts him -- face battered, bloody -- shaking, battling internal spasms. ZAGON Can you feel the chemicals, cherry? You can't fight 'em much longer -- NICO Long enough to finish you. Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon in the face with one lightning blow. We see Zagon's nose and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken- ing sound. \nABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                             108. \nAs the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with one arm. He begins to now do to Zagon's neck what he did to his arm. We hear a terminal CRACK. Zagon's body crumples to the floor. Nico, in delirium, staggers toward the door -- 409    INT.

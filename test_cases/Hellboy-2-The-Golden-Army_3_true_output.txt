MANNING 
PLEASE- Disgusted, Manning turns off the TV's. 
MANNING Aw- this is a disaster! A disaster- you hear?? Worse than Cheney with a shotgun. Only Liz- 
(BEAT) Only Liz handled herself with any dignity. 
LIZ (glancing at HB) No one asked me anything. Manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a table. 
MANNING Don't bother starting a fan club. It's trending five to one against us. 
HELLBOY Against? 
HELLBOY 2 26 
LIZ (glances at some letters) Polls- protests- hate mail- Liz grabs a few letters and scans them. 
LIZ 
(READING) "Unwelcome species... mongrelizing... lower orders... ungodly freaks..." She glares at Hellboy. 
HELLBOY Ungodly freaks-? Us? 
MANNING You really did it this time- I'm under review. (to Hellboy) But so are you- As of today, there's a new team leader. 
HELLBOY New - ? What? 
MANNING Yes- You heard me. A new team leader. We're to meet him at the conference room at 0900- (looks at his watch) Now. 
47 INT. SECURITY POUND BPRD - SAME 47 
The SECURITY POUND is row after row of stacked cages, each one imprisoning a different CREATURE. BPRD AGENTS patrol the pens, feeding the occupants, cleaning the pans- HB looks at Manning, who is edgy and nervous. 
HELLBOY What's the matter, Manning?? Don't you trust me anymore? 
MANNING Oh- I never did- But after last night, Washington wants a new public face for the BPRD- 
HELLBOY 2 27 
HELLBOY What about me? What's wrong with my face??? 
MANNING Or mine??? The press loves me!! But now you've ruined it all- 
HELLBOY But, who-? Who is this guy? 
MANNING How would I know? Evidently, he's quite the big shot- (he reads a file) His name is Johann Kraus- 
HELLBOY Akkk- Kraus??? He's German- 
MANNING 
(OVERLAPPING) -a physical medium, head of the European branch of the BPRD- 
HELLBOY 
(OVERLAPPING) You know I have a problem with Germans- 
MANNING 
(OVERLAPPING) -a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult Practice from the University of Munich and a very eloquent speaker-

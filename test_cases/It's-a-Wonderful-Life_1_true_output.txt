Ernie stops the cab, and George enters it. 
GEORGE Ernie, take me home. I'm off my nut! 
ERNIE (a much harder Ernie) Where do you live? 
GEORGE Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up. 
ERNIE Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?... 
GEORGE Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick. 
ERNIE All right.  He pulls down the flag on the meter and starts the cab. 
INT. CAB  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ERNIE 
Ernie is puzzled by the stranger. 
GEORGE Look here, Ernie, straighten me out here.  I've got some bad liquor or something.  Listen to me now. Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid? That's right, isn't it? 
ERNIE (suspiciously) You seen my wife? 
GEORGE (exasperated) Seen your wife? I've been to your house a hundred times. 
ERNIE Look, bud, what's the idea?  I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid...  And I ain't never seen you before in my life. 
GEORGE Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home. 
Ernie turns to driving, but he's worried about his passenger. As he passes the burlesque house he sees Bert the cop standing beside his police car. Attracting his attention, he motions to Bert to follow him, indicating he has a nut in the back. Bert gets into his car and follows. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT 
MEDIUM LONG SHOT 
The taxi pulls up to the curb and stops. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
The cab is parked. George gets out and looks at the house. 
ERNIE Is this the place? 
GEORGE Of course it's the place. 
ERNIE Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years. 
EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT 
George is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house. Windows are broken, the porch sags, one section of the roof has fallen, doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges. Like a doomed man, George approaches the house. 
EXT. CAB  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
The police car has pulled up beside the cab, and Bert and Ernie stand watching George's actions. 
BERT What's up, Ernie? 
ERNIE I don't know, but we better keep an eye on this guy. He's bats. 
Ernie switches on the spotlight on his cab, and turns the beam toward the old house. 
INT. HALLWAY GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike, by Ernie's spotlight. No furniture, cobwebs, wallpaper hanging and swinging  stairs are broken and collapsed. In a voice that sounds like a cry for help, George yells out: 
GEORGE Mary! Mary! Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu! Where are you? 
Clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall. 
CLARENCE They're not here, George. You have no children. 
GEORGE (ignoring him) Where are you? (then, to Clarence) What have you done with them? 
INT. DOORWAY  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
Bert is standing in the entrance, with his gun in his hand. Ernie is a few feet behind him, ready to run. 
BERT All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you. 
GEORGE Bert! Thank heaven you're here! 
He rushes toward Bert. 
BERT Stand back. 
GEORGE Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids? 
ERNIE (warningly) Watch him, Bert. 
BERT Come on, come on. 
GEORGE (bewildered) Bert  Ernie! What's the matter with you two guys? You were here on my wedding night. You, both of you, stood out here on the porch and sung to us, don't you remember? 
ERNIE (nervously) Think I'd better be going. 
BERT Look, now why don't you be a good kid and we'll take you in to a doctor. Everything's going to be all right. 
Bert tries to lead George away by the arm, but George struggles with him, trying to explain. 
GEORGE Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen! (gesturing to Clarence) It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me. 
BERT I hate to do this, fella. 
Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head. As he does so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist, forcing him to let George go. 
CLARENCE Run... George! Run, George! 
George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Bert grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground, wrestling. We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs on Clarence. 
CLARENCE Help! Joseph, help! 
BERT Oh, shut up! 
CLARENCE Help, oh Joseph, help! Joseph! 
Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands. Bert gets up, amazed by his vanishing.

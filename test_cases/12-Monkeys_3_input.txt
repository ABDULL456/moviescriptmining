DR. FLETCHER Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out? 
COLE Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time. 
DR. FLETCHER So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future? 
COLE No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present. 
RESIDENT #2 "From the present."  We're not in the present now, Mr. Cole? 
COLE No, no.  This is the past.  This has already happened.  Listen... 
RESIDENT #3 Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's the present, is that it? 
COLE No, 1995 is the past, too.  Look... 
DR. FLETCHER These scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are they doctors like ourselves? 
Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks. 
COLE No!  I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid. You have to let me use the phone.  One call! 
COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers. 
INT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY 
Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER lunges for the phone, answers sharply... 
MOTHER Yes? (listens, frowns, then) Whaaaaat?  "Voice mail"!  I don't know what you're talkin' about. ... Is this a joke?  I don't know any scientists. James who?  Never heard of you! 
The MOTHER slams down the phone. 
INT.  RAILLY'S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY 
A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  Sympathetically, RAILLY takes it from him. 
RAILLY It wasn't who you expected? 
COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts? 
COLE It was some lady.  She didn't know anything. 
RAILLY Perhaps it was a wrong number... 
COLE No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things. 
RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest. It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool, detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly. 
RAILLY James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore? 
COLE (lost in thought) What? 
RAILLY I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...? 
COLE Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them? 
RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle, pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE. 
RAILLY James, take these. (watching him step back) Please -- I helped you like I said I would.  Now I want you to trust me. 
INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM) 
MR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE. 
MR. PONYTAIL WATCH IT! 
Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  It was definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE. 
TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out... 
WOMAN'S VOICE NOOOOOOOOOO! 
The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak.  The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER! 
Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  It's the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured.  He's sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his moustache slightly askew! 
A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out!  Then, DAZZLING LIGHT. Everything goes white! 
INT.  DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
COLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight. 
He's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented. Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING, occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures of an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed. 
His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit. 
He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window. 
With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out. 
COLE'S POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single tree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses. 
ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed. 
VOICE (o.s.) It won't work. You can't open it.

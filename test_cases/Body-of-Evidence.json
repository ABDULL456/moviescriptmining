{"train": "BODY OF EVIDENCE \nB O D Y   O F   E V I D E N C E \nby Brad Mirman (second draft) \nOver the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love.  A MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately. \nFADE IN: \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman. \nShe moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster. \nThe CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what we are watching is on a TELEVISION. \nFurther back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS standing before the television watching the act. \nThe CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE, looking, dusting, talking. \nWe continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain. \nEXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT \nLIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path. The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING. \nA four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties, with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair. He does not run through the rain -- he walks. \nDETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a homicide detective runs out to meet him. \nCARDENAS Is it Marsh? \nREESE Yeah. \nJust a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an instant, then it's gone. \nREESE Sir, do you mind if we get out of the rain? \nCardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question. \nCARDENAS Who found him? \nREESE His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow. \nCARDENAS She was here? \nREESE No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers. \nCARDENAS Show me. \nReese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN. \nINT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT \nPull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of Marsh in bed. \nCardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of indifference. \nStanding by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes. \nCARDENAS How long? \nMCCURDY About three hours. \nCARDENAS Cause? \nMCCURDY Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow. \nCARDENAS Any prints on the nasal spray? \nREESE Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's. \nTROXELL What if he did know what was in it? A lot of users put it in nasal spray bottles so they can use it in public. \nMCCURDY Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want. \nCARDENAS Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene? \nREESE A man across the street from Marsh saw her drive up about four thirty Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are all over the place. \nCardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall.  He gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one. \nTROXELL Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose? \nCARDENAS What did he say about Miss Lawson? \nTROXELL He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office. \nCardenas throws another dart at the board. \nCARDENAS So she knew about his heart? \nTROXELL Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson. \nCARDENAS What about the will? \nTROXELL That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything. \nEXT.  CEMETERY - MORNING \nGray clouds hang over head.  A light drizzle falls.  A GROUP of MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave. \nIn the b.g. the PRESS is visible, held back my private SECURITY GUARDS. \nA WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS, her face hidden behind a hat and veil.  RAYMOND SATTLER, a tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside her.  He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.  The service concludes.  Sattler along with several other PEOPLE offer her their condolences.  Joanne Braslow is there.  She does not go over to Rebecca. \nCARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree. Cardenas watches and waits.  He steps forward as Sattler leads the woman by. \nCARDENAS Miss Lawson? \nThe Woman stops.  Her back is to Cardenas. \nCARDENAS I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas. \nREBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns around.  She is in her late twenties.  A deep pain fills her face -- controlled, but evident.  Her eyes are tired -- heavy from crying -- but no tears show now.  This is a woman whose grief is private and not displayed for others.  Although emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.  So beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide how impressed he is. \nSATTLER I don't think that this is the time, or the place. \nCARDENAS I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry. \nSATTLER An inquiry into what? \nCARDENAS For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death? \nSATTLER Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime. \nCARDENAS Did I say it was a natural death? \nCardenas and Rebecca lock eyes.  Rebecca stares at him genuinely shocked by his accusation.  Cardenas nods and walks away.  In the b.g. we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with hostility. \nINT.  HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nLarge and homey.  A fire roars in the fireplace.  FRANK DULANEY sits on his couch as he goes over some PAPERWORK.  He is mid- thirties, powerful, self-assured. \nSHARON DULANEY enters.  She is an attractive woman in her early thirties.  She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his PAPERWORK aside and sits down on his lap. \nSHARON You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing. \nSATTLER I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files. \nDULANEY Why? \nSATTLER Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have. \nDULANEY Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have. \nSATTLER (jokingly) Well, I guess that makes you the best. (candidly) Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her. \nDulaney thinks about it for a moment. \nDULANEY Alright, I'll talk to her \nSATTLER She's waiting in the conference room. \nDulaney stands and walks towards the door. \nSATTLER (continuing) You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for almost twenty years -- or thought I did.  What do you think would make a man in his condition do the things he did? \nDulaney stops at the door and looks back. \nDULANEY I think the question is:  What is it about her that made him want to do it? \nINT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nRebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a CIGARETTE.  Sunlight flows through a window and highlights her hair.  She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that clings to every curve of her body. \nDulaney enters the room.  When he sees her he can't help but stare.  Rebecca notes his gaze. \nDULANEY Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney. \nShe raises the cigarette to her lips.  Dulaney notices despite her outward composure her hand is shaking. \nREBECCA (nervously) Are you going to represent me? \nDULANEY There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur. (beat) Did you kill him? \nRebecca appears hurt by the question. \nREBECCA You don't waste any time, do you? \nDulaney doesn't answer.  He studies her -- his eyes probing hers. \nREBECCA (continuing) Do you think I did it? \nDULANEY I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you. \nREBECCA You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint? \nDULANEY Not a very good one I'm afraid. \nREBECCA And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney. \nDULANEY You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges. \nRebecca's anxiety begins to surface.  She feigns a weak smile. \nREBECCA He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others. \nDULANEY You still haven't answered my question. \nShe takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering.  She looks at Dulaney.  Displaying emotions is not something that comes easily.  Tears well up in her eyes. \nREBECCA (emotionally) I loved him.  A big part of my life has been torn away from me, Mr. Dulaney.  A part I can never get back -- and on top of that people are saying that I am somehow responsible for it.  They've taken everything that is good and caring about two people in love and made it dirty. \nA single tear streams down her check.  She knows what he wants to hear her say -- and she resents having to say it. \nREBECCA No -- I didn't kill him. \nREESE What time did you leave? \nREBECCA Six thirty -- and he was very much alive. \nCARDENAS Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine? \nREBECCA I have. \nCARDENAS Did you use it the night Marsh died? \nREBECCA No.  I haven't done it in years. \nREESE Did Marsh use it? \nREBECCA No -- never. \nREESE It had to get there somehow. \nREBECCA It didn't get there from me. \nCARDENAS Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition? \nREBECCA No. \nCARDENAS Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions. \nREBECCA That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious. \nREESE He never mentioned his heart disease? \nDULANEY She just said that. \nREESE Why do you think he lied to you? \nDULANEY That's something only Marsh would know. \nREESE I think Miss Lawson knew it too.  I think she slipped him the coke and he popped his cork giving her the high- hard-one. \nDulaney's anger shows.  He stands. \nDULANEY That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you. \nCARDENAS Sit down, Frank. \nDULANEY No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving. \nA beat.  Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes.  Cardenas shrugs his shoulders. \nCARDENAS Fine. \nDulaney motions for Rebecca to get up.  She stands and they walk to the door.  Reese looks at Cardenas.  Cardenas nods. \nREESE Rebecca Lawson, you're under arrest for the murder of Andrew Marsh. \nRebecca is stunned -- frightened.  She looks at Dulaney in disbelief.  Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily.  Reese removes his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca. \nREESE You have the right to remain silent. If you give up-- \nCARDENAS (to Reese) I don't think the handcuffs will be necessary.  You can finish giving Miss Lawson her rights outside. \nReese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door.  She looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes welling with tears. \nREBECCA (frightened) Frank! \nDULANEY I'll have you out in a few hours. \nReese ushers her through the door.  A beat.  Dulaney and Cardenas are left alone.  Cardenas starts fishing through a can of NUTS, carefully extracting the cashews.  Dulaney continues to stand. \nDULANEY Lookin' to make the papers, John? \nREBECCA Something like that. \nDULANEY We're not animals. \nAs Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated. \nREBECCA Of course we are.  Our primal urges are still there -- but we've taken sex and intellectualized it, refined it down to its most essential components.  It's bland, easy, mechanical.  There's great passion in the struggle -- such craving in denial.  Do you know what it's like to yearn for something?  I'm not talking about wanting, or needing. I'm talking about an urge so deep that your skin burns and every cell in your body pulses with desire? \nDulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside. \nDULANEY (awkwardly) I think we're getting a little off the subject here. \nREBECCA I thought the subject was sex? \nDULANEY As it pertains to you -- not me. (beat) Did you always know you had different... tastes? \nREBECCA Yes. \nDULANEY How? \nREBECCA I don't know if it's something I can explain to you. \nDULANEY Why not? \nREBECCA Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined. \nDULANEY Try. \nRebecca thinks for a moment. \nREBECCA When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down. \nDULANEY If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard? \nREBECCA Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it. \nDulaney appears lost in her words.  This isn't lost on Rebecca. She walks off.  Dulaney stares after her intrigued. \nINT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING \nA light rain falls outside.  Dulaney picks at his food.  He stares out the window.  He seems oblivious to the conversation between Sharon and Michael. \nMICHAEL Albert's got the stomach flu. \nSHARON That's too bad. \nMICHAEL No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch. \nSHARON Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well. \nMICHAEL Not even if they're a dork? \nSHARON Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling. \nMICHAEL No way.  Jerry Milner stopped by and Albert puked right in front of him. \nSharon tries to suppress a grin. \nSHARON Don't use language like that at the dinner table. \nMICHAEL Sorry. \nSharon looks at Dulaney.  He is still staring out the window, deep in thought. \nINT.  DEN - EVENING \nDulaney is at his desk, looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of Marsh and the bedroom.  Sharon enters. \nSHARON Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him. \nINT.  RESTAURANT - DAY \nDimly lit.  Dark wood and leather.  Dulaney sits at a table with Rebecca.  She removes a CIGARETTE and holds it, waiting for Dulaney to light it.  Dulaney fumbles through his pockets and removes a book of MATCHES.  He lights one.  Rebecca doesn't lean forward to meet him.  He must go to her.  She looks into his eyes as she cups her hand over his.  A beat.  She lights the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling.  SHE DOES NOT BLOW OUT THE MATCH OR REMOVE HER HAND FROM DULANEY'S.  She watches him as it burns down towards his fingers.  After a long moment she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his hand. \nDULANEY How'd you meet Marsh? \nREBECCA I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless. \nA FOURSOME a few tables away are staring at her.  Rebecca sees them. \nDULANEY -- And then? \nREBECCA We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left. \nDULANEY Why didn't you live together? \nREBECCA Andrew was worried about how it would look. \nA COUPLE in a booth are looking at Rebecca and whispering. Rebecca and Dulaney notice them. \nREBECCA Can we get out of here? \nDULANEY Sure.  Where to? \nRebecca stands up.  She doesn't answer.  She just walks off. \nEXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nDulaney pulls up in his car behind Rebecca's.  They get out. Dulaney follows her as she walks to the door. \nDULANEY This is your house. \nREBECCA (walking towards the door) I know. \nDulaney stops. \nDULANEY I don't think this is a good idea. \nRebecca stops and turns towards him. \nREBECCA Why not? \nDULANEY Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house. \nREBECCA Is it against the law? \nDULANEY No -- it just doesn't look right. \nRebecca stares at him for a moment, then looks down the street to her left and back to her right, then back at Dulaney. \nREBECCA No one's looking. \nShe walks to her front door and opens it.  She enters, leaving the door open.  Dulaney waits for a moment, then follows. \nINT.  REBECCA'S, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nDulaney enters.  Rebecca is standing in the middle of the room. Her back is to Dulaney, but she knows he is there.  Dulaney looks around the room.  He stares at a group of PHOTOGRAPHS on the wall.  On the other WALL is a GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN. \nDULANEY'S POV - OF THE WALL \nfilled with EROTIC PAINTINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHS -- sensual but not vulgar. \nRebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies the artwork. \nREBECCA What do you think? \nDULANEY I think the photographer's probably a voyeur. \nREBECCA I'm the photographer. \nAn old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake.  Dulaney and Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it. \nREBECCA I figured if we have to talk all day we might as well do it someplace nice. \n(looks at the cabin) Isn't it beautiful? \nDULANEY Yeah. \nREBECCA (sadly) Andrew loved this old cabin. (fondly remembering) He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum. (a sad smile) I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it. \nHer mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant memory. \nREBECCA (snapping out of it) Sorry. \nDULANEY It's okay. \nEXT.  LAKE, FURTHER - DUSK \nDulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore.  A soft wind blows through her hair. \nDULANEY Tell me about Doctor Paley? \nREBECCA I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me. \nDULANEY It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off. \nREBECCA (confidently) It won't be that hard. \nShe walks off. \nEXT.  CABIN - DUSK \nDulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing. \nREBECCA Did you always want to be a lawyer? \nDULANEY No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player. \nREBECCA Really? \nDULANEY Yeah. \nREBECCA That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened? \nDULANEY I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream. \nREBECCA It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want? \nDulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light of the setting sun.  Their eyes meet.  He starts to lean in towards her -- then stops.  He gets up and walks away. \nEXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING \nRebecca's car pulls up in front.  Dulaney gets out. \nREBECCA I'm going to put the car away.  You can let yourself in.  There's a key under the flower pot. \nRebecca drives to the rear of the building.  Dulaney walks to the door.  He lifts the FLOWER POT -- removes a KEY -- opens the door and goes inside. \nANGLE - DOWN THE STREET \nDetective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house.  He glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad. \nINT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nRebecca walks over to the STEREO and turns on the CASSETTE PLAYER.  The room fills with soft, sexy MUSIC.  Dulaney stands in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move. \nREBECCA Yes -- it would be nice. \nDULANEY What would? \nJUDGE BURNHAM, a confident BLACK MAN in his fifties sits behind the bench.  He is strong-willed -- tough but fair.  There is a rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets. \nJUDGE BURNHAM This trial by its very nature is explosive.  The press is going to have a field day and I will not tolerate any activity in my courtroom that will fuel it. (to Dulaney and Cardenas) Both of you are going to be delving into very personal aspects of peoples lives.  I warn you now.  When you do so -- if you cannot establish a clear line of relevancy early on in your examinations I will stop you.  Is that clear? \nDulaney and Cardenas both nod. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Cardenas. \nCardenas stands and walks towards the JURY. \nCARDENAS (points to Rebecca) You all can see the defendant, Rebecca Lawson.  But as this trial proceeds you will see that she is not only the defendant -- she is the murder weapon itself. \n(stops and thinks for a moment) Is that possible?  Can a person actually be a weapon?  The answer is yes.  If I hit you and you die -- I am the cause of your death.  But can sex be called a weapon?  Yes.  And what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson made of it.  The State will prove that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh -- that she put increasing sexual demands on him while she secretly administered cocaine.  All the while knowing that he had a severe heart condition. (beat) She is a beautiful woman -- but when this trial is over you will see her no differently than a gun, or a knife or any other instrument used as a weapon.  She is a killer.  And the worst kind -- one who disguised herself as a loving partner. \nCardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney? \nDulaney stands up and approaches the jury. \nDULANEY I know what you're thinking -- and it's a mistake.  You look at Miss Lawson and you see a beautiful woman who was involved with an older man -- and you think she looks like the type.  She could've done it.  And that's exactly what the District Attorney wants you to think.  Yes, she is beautiful.  So what?  Does that make her a killer?  Of course not.  This case is not about appearances.  It's about facts. (beat) As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you will see that there are very few facts -- that the bulk of the States evidence is circumstantial.  I'm confident that by the conclusion of this trial you will not just have a reasonable doubt.  You will have no doubt at all --  that Rebecca Lawson is innocent of the charges against her. \nINT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY \nMcCurdy is on the witness stand.  Cardenas stands before him. \nCARDENAS Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death? \nMCCURDY A massive cardiac arrest. \nCARDENAS What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death? \nMCCURDY Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease. \nCARDENAS Was the heart attack the result of natural causes? \nMCCURDY No. \nCARDENAS What induced it? \nMCCURDY We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood. \nCARDENAS So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine? \nMCCURDY I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage. \nCARDENAS Then how did it get into his body? \nMCCURDY We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine. \nCardenas holds up a bottle of NASAL SPRAY in a PLASTIC BAG.  He brings it over to McCurdy. \nCARDENAS Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand? \nMCCURDY (examines it) Yes. \nCARDENAS Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A. (to McCurdy) Were any fingerprints found on the bottle? \nMCCURDY Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's. \nCARDENAS Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition? \nMCCURDY Increase his heart rate. \nCARDENAS -- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine? \nMCCURDY It would be an added stress to his heart. \nCARDENAS What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love? \nJOANNE Yes. \nCARDENAS Tell the court about that, please. \nJOANNE I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial. \nCARDENAS Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death? \nJOANNE Yes. \nCARDENAS How did he look? \nJOANNE Horrible.  He was tired and pale. \nCARDENAS Did you talk about Miss Lawson? \nJOANNE Yes. \nCARDENAS What did Mr. Marsh say? \nJOANNE He was worried.  He said that she was acting stranger and stranger.  He said that if this kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it. \nThere is an audible BUZZ from the crowd.  For the first time Rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with genuine concern. \nCARDENAS Thank you. (to Dulaney) Your witness. \nCardenas sits down.  Dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards Joanne. \nDULANEY How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom? \nJOANNE What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial? \nDULANEY Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom? \nJOANNE Yes-- (thinks a moment) It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth. \nDULANEY Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death? \nJOANNE He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it. \nDULANEY Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile? \nJOANNE Yes -- he mentioned it. \nDULANEY So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress. \nJOANNE I suppose. \nDULANEY So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it. \nTHE JURY waits anxiously for her answer. \nJoanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks.  She appears confused. \nJOANNE I don't know.  I'm not sure. \nDULANEY Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible? \nJOANNE (begrudgingly) Yes.  I suppose it's possible. \nCardenas leans back in his seat frustrated.  Rebecca breathes a sigh of relief. \nINT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON \nQuiet and desolate -- most of the city employees have left for the day.  Dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with Rebecca. \nREBECCA You were brilliant today. \nDULANEY It's only the beginning. \nDULANEY (pleading) Rebecca -- please.  No more. \nRebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly. \nREBECCA I told you in the beginning that it was my way.  My way can be many things -- pleasure or pain. \nShe lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn. He tenses as she pours it on his chest.  -- then relaxes when he realizes it's water.  He breathes a SIGH of relief. \nREBECCA You see how life is, Frank?  We judge things.  We look at things from the outside and assume we know what's on the inside. \nShe takes a sip from the bottle. \nREBECCA Water.  But you assumed it was vinegar -- because you were only looking at the outside. \nHer meaning isn't lost on Dulaney.  She watches him -- as if studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly,  she pulls on the belt of her ROBE.  The robe parts revealing the beauty of her body.  She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing her breasts against him.  Dulaney's breathing quickens in excitement.  Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing his burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach. She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower. \nCLOSE ON DULANEY \nhe stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion.  Soon the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him.  His eyes close.  The pain that only moments ago filled his body is replaced with pleasure. \nINT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's late.  Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs.  A LIGHT comes on.  Sharon is sitting on the couch waiting. \nSHARON Late night? \nHer voice startles Dulaney. \nDULANEY Yeah -- what are you doing up? \nSHARON We have to talk. \nDULANEY What's wrong? \nSHARON That's what I was hoping you'd tell me. \nDulaney enters the living room. \nDULANEY Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point? \nSHARON Where have you been? \nDULANEY Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements. \nSHARON Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. (beat) You were with her, weren't you? \nDULANEY Yes. \nSHARON Why did you lie to me? \nDULANEY Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking. \nSharon springs off the couch. \nSHARON This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me. \nDULANEY I'm not. \nSHARON You're sleeping with her, aren't you? \nDULANEY No. \nSHARON It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me. \nShe starts to walks out of the room.  Dulaney grabs her by the arm. \nDULANEY Sharon... \nShe swings around and slaps him across the face, then stares at him angrily, her eyes filled with tears. \nCARDENAS Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened. \nDULANEY (to Cardenas) I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else. \nCARDENAS Your Honor -- please! \nJUDGE BURNHAM I'll see both of you in my chambers. Right now. \nINT.  JUDGE BURNHAM'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER \nJudge Burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his desk.  Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you? \nDULANEY No, Your Honor. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible. (beat) Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics. \nEXT.  COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON \nDulaney walks down the steps.  Cardenas joins him. \nCARDENAS I'm surprised you can walk after the way Burnham chewed your ass out this afternoon. \nCardenas grins.  His comment was meant as a friendly jab between old friends.  Dulaney doesn't see it that way. \nDULANEY (coldly) I've got work to do. \nCARDENAS Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds. \nDULANEY I didn't hear it. \nCARDENAS What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you. \nDULANEY Back off, John. \nCardenas studies him for a moment. \nCARDENAS You're sleeping with her, aren't you? \nDulaney forces a laugh.  It's not a very convincing one. \nDULANEY That's ridiculous. \nCARDENAS I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over. \nDULANEY You don't know what you're talking about. \nCARDENAS Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning? \nDULANEY You've been following me? \nCARDENAS Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember? \nSomething in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Cardenas and pushes him up against the wall.  Cardenas pushes back. \nCARDENAS If your head wasn't up your ass you would have thought of it too.  You're losing perspective.  Get out while you can -- before she takes you down with her. \nINT.  HALLWAY - AFTERNOON \nDulaney walks towards his office.  Biggs walks quickly down the hall and joins him. \nBIGGS I've been waiting for you to get back. \nDULANEY You got something on the coke? \nBIGGS No -- but I got something. \nBiggs steps into Dulaney's office.  Dulaney follows. \nJOANNE Yes. \nDULANEY It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you. \nJOANNE I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him. \nDulaney studies her. \nJOANNE (continuing) I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will. \nDULANEY Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow. \nDulaney walks off.  Joanne stares after him.  Her face is cold, showing no sign of emotion. \nINT.  COURTROOM - DAY \nDulaney sits beside Rebecca, but he seems distant.  Cardenas stands up. \nCARDENAS The State calls Jeffery Roston. \nAs soon as she hears the name Rebecca's face becomes tense, nervous.  Dulaney notices it.  He checks a list. \nDULANEY Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness. \nCARDENAS The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago. \nJudge Burnham motions for Dulaney and Cardenas to approach the bench. \nCARDENAS Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier? \nCARDENAS He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony. \nDULANEY But Your Honor-- \nJUDGE BURNHAM That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat. \nDulaney walks back to his chair.  Rebecca appears genuinely nervous. \nINT.  COURTROOM - LATER \nCardenas stands before ROSTON a handsome man with salt and pepper hair in his late fifties. \nCARDENAS Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson? \nROSTON We were lovers. \nCARDENAS How long were you together? \nROSTON For about one year. \nCARDENAS How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson? \nROSTON Intense. \nCARDENAS I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific? \nROSTON It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition. \nCARDENAS What kind of condition are you referring to? \nROSTON I had a bad heart. \nThere is an AUDIBLE GASP from the crowd.  Cardenas waits, giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of Roston's last statement. \nDulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded.  He tries to control his surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't.  He stares ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the testimony. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Due to the sensitive nature of this witness' testimony and the inability of the spectators to allow him to complete it, I am clearing the courtroom. \nSounds of protest fill the room as the BAILIFFS start to usher out the crowd. \nINT.  COURTROOM LATER \nThe gallery is empty.  Only Dulaney, Rebecca, Cardenas, Troxell, Roston, Judge Burnham, The Jury and Court Officials remain. \nCARDENAS What did she do next, Mr. Roston? \nROSTON She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her. (beat) At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die. \nCARDENAS If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it? \nROSTON I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had. \nCARDENAS What happened after that? \nROSTON I woke up the next morning and she was gone. \nCARDENAS Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson? \nROSTON Yes. \nCARDENAS Who was your primary beneficiary? \nROSTON She was. \nCARDENAS Thank you.  The State rests. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Mister Dulaney? \nDulaney is stunned -- deep in thought.  He doesn't appear to hear the question. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Mister Dulaney? \nDulaney looks at the jury.  What he sees isn't good.  He thinks for a moment.  He leans over and quickly speaks with Rebecca. We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated. Rebecca says something.  Dulaney looks at Roston.  A beat. Dulaney stands. \nDULANEY Mr. Roston, you said it was the best sex you ever had.  Is that the best sex with a woman, or a man? \nCardenas bolts from his seat. \nCARDENAS Objection! \nDULANEY I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual? \nCARDENAS Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial. \nDULANEY Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was. \nJudge Burnham thinks for a moment. \nJUDGE BURNHAM The witness will answer the question. \nDULANEY Mr. Roston? \nROSTON Yes. \nDULANEY And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson? \nROSTON Yes. \nDULANEY And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover? \nROSTON Yes. \nDULANEY And she left shortly after that? \nA pause.  Roston thinks, struggling to make a decision. \nMISS SELLERS There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired. \nINT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - DUSK \nDulaney is at his desk.  Biggs enters excited. \nBIGGS Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler. \nDULANEY Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive. \nBIGGS What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will. \nDulaney thinks for a moment.  He grins as an idea enters his mind. \nDULANEY Not this will. \nINT.  FILE ROOM - EVENING \nDulaney and Biggs sit at a table going through a stack of papers.  Dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper. \nDULANEY Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. \nBIGGS What good does that do -- it's the old will? \nDULANEY Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated. \nBIGGS She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick. \nINT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING \nDulaney is washing up for dinner.  He speaks to Sharon who is in the bedroom. \nDULANEY I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend. \nSHARON Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael. \nSharon leaves the room.  Dulaney reaches for his TOOTHBRUSH -- picks up a TUBE of TOOTH PASTE.  It is empty.  He stares at the EMPTY TUBE. \nDULANEY (to himself) Drug store. \nINT.  COURTROOM - MORNING \nDulaney looks worn, tired -- the tension between him and Rebecca shows. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney, are you ready to call your next witness? \nDulaney doesn't seem to hear him. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney, are you with us? \nDulaney snaps out of it. \nDULANEY Yes, Your Honor.  The defense recalls Joanne Braslow. \nAs Joanne walks towards the stand Dulaney looks over at Rebecca.  It's as if he is trying to make up his mind about her.  Joanne takes her seat. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath. \nDULANEY How often do you use cocaine? \nCardenas shoots out of his seat. \nCARDENAS Objection, Your Honor. \nJUDGE BURNHAM (impatiently) Counsel approach the bench. \nDulaney and Cardenas walk over to the bench. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney, I'm getting tired of seeing you this close to me. \nDULANEY Would you read for us the time of the purchase? \nJOANNE Three fifteen. \nDULANEY A.M -- or P.M.? \nJOANNE P.M. \nDULANEY You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there? \nJOANNE I don't know. \nDULANEY Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought? \nJOANNE (nervously) No. \nDULANEY Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle? \nJOANNE No!  Why would I want to kill him? \nDULANEY Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored. \nSILENCE fills the room.  Members of the JURY look at Rebecca, they are confused -- doubt fills their minds. \nDULANEY The defense rests. \nINT.  DULANEY'S DEN - EVENING \nDark.  Dulaney is standing by the window, watching the RAIN FALL outside.  Sharon enters. \nSHARON We can't go on like this, Frank. \nDulaney continues to stare out the window. \nDULANEY I know. \nSHARON Talk to me. \nHe shakes his NO. \nSHARON Please -- this is ripping us apart. \nDULANEY (emotionally) I can't talk about it now. \nShe senses his pain and moves to him, wrapping her arms around his shoulders. \nSHARON Don't shut me out.  Let me in. \nHe turns and faces her.  She can see the pain on his face. \nDULANEY You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore. \nSHARON We can't pretend this isn't happening. \nDULANEY Please -- not now. \nSHARON Why didn't you come to me? \nDULANEY I don't know. \nSHARON You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me. \nDULANEY It's more involved than that. \nSHARON It was a place to start. \nDULANEY You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you? \nSHARON I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are. \nDulaney sits beside Rebecca.  In the row behind them is Sattler and Biggs. \nThe JURY enters.  Their faces betray nothing.  One by one they file into their seats. \nCardenas sits with Troxell -- both of them watching anxiously. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? \nThe JURY FOREMAN stands. \nJURY FOREMAN We have, Your Honor. \nThe BAILIFF walks over and takes the VERDICT SLIP from the FOREMAN, then walks over to Judge Burnham and hands it to him. Judge Burnham reads the decision.  He hands it back to the Bailiff who takes it to the COURT CLERK. \nON REBECCA \nShe waits nervously for the Court Clerk to read the verdict. \nON CARDENAS \nhe taps his pen against the desk anxiously. \nON THE COURT CLERK \nHe opens the verdict slip and looks at it.  He stands slowly. \nCOURT CLERK The jury finds the defendant -- not guilty. \nRelief floods Rebecca's face.  Dulaney shows no emotion. Sattler and Biggs shakes hands, then lean forward to congratulate Dulaney. \nRebecca turns to Dulaney to hug him -- before she can, Dulaney has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom. \nINT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON \nDulaney walks towards his car with Biggs.  There is no sense of victory or elation. \nBIGGS What are you gonna do now? \nDULANEY Take some time off. \nBIGGS You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne? \nDULANEY I don't know. \nDulaney reaches his car. \nDULANEY You did a good job, Charlie. \nBIGGS Thanks, Mister D. \nBiggs walks away.  Dulaney takes out his keys, opens the door to his car.  He is about to get in when he senses someone behind him.  He turns around. \nJoanne steps out from behind a pillar.  She stares at Dulaney hatefully.  Her hand is inside her purse. \nJOANNE That bastard should have left me something.  I worked for him for six years -- and he goes and gives it all to her. \nDulaney looks around the parking lot.  He is alone.  Joanne is obviously very high on something.  Her mind seems to wander, her eyes drift. \nJOANNE You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off. \nDULANEY Then you would have gotten your money? \nJOANNE Yes. \nDULANEY You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne? \nJOANNE Do you think if I did I'd be stupid enough to tell you? \nDulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse. \nTwo CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES are on the floor by the couch.  Dulaney looks on the coffee table. \nHIS POV - COFFEE TABLE \nA VIAL is open and on its side.  A RAZOR BLADE and STRAW lay next to it.  A pile of WHITE POWDER has been dumped out. Several lines of cocaine have been drawn. \nDulaney starts to move towards the living room.  He is almost at the door when the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION TURNS ON.  We see the tape of Dulaney and Rebecca making love. \nREBECCA (OS) Is this what you're looking for, Frank? \nDulaney turns around to find Rebecca standing behind him, a remote control in her hand. \nDULANEY (distant) You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off. \nREBECCA That's crazy. \nDULANEY Is it?  Joanne Braslow was perfect, wasn't she?  You knew we'd see her on the tape and find out about her coke problem.  After that, the digging should have been easy -- but we missed the will.  You knew we were following her, so you called Koehler and had him contact her.  That put us right back on track.  All we needed then was to prove that she had an opportunity.  The drug store took care of that.  She dropped off the stuff and you came back and killed him.  Didn't you? \nShe shrugs her shoulders.  His frustration clearly amuses her. She grins slightly, almost taunting him. \nDULANEY I want the tape. \nDulaney starts into the living room. \nREBECCA I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy. \nDULANEY That wasn't the deal. \nREBECCA (provoking him) So, sue me. (as cold as ice) Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again. \nDULANEY (growing angrier) I'm not leaving without that tape. \nREBECCA Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite. \nDulaney loses control. \nDULANEY You fuckin' bitch! \nHe grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall. Rebecca struggles, but it is little use -- he is a man consumed with rage.  Dulaney continues to smash her into the wall. \nRebecca reaches onto the desk -- lifts up a FOUNTAIN PEN and stabs it into Dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck. Dulaney SCREAMS and lets go.  Rebecca starts to runs into the living room.  Dulaney follows. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nDulaney catches Rebecca -- grabs her -- spins her around -- then backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground. In the b.g. the VIDEO of them in bed plays on the screen. Dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair.  He repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor. \nMAN'S VOICE Let her go! \nDulaney stops.  He looks behind him. \nHIS POV \nStanding in the bedroom doorway is Dr. Paley.  He is holding a GUN at Dulaney. \nDulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his feet, his hand holding the wound on his shoulder.  A short, breathless LAUGH drifts out of Dulaney as he starts to put it all together.  Rebecca stands up, holding her head as she tries to catch her breath. \nDR. PALEY (to Rebecca) Are you alright? \nRebecca NODS.  Her face hardens. \nREBECCA You've got to kill him, Alan. \nDR. PALEY What? \nDULANEY She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder. \nREBECCA Shoot him. \nPaley struggles to make a decision.  The gun shakes in his hand.  Suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney. \n", "test1_input": "Sattler walks over with another MAN.  He ignores Biggs. \nSATTLER Frank -- this is Harvey Willows from the L.A. Times.  He'd like to ask you a few questions. \nMAN It's an incredible story going on here. (as if quoting a headline) Woman accused of using sex to kill lover. \nBIGGS I'll say -- it's gonna give a whole new meaning to the state nickname. \nBiggs LAUGHS and walks off.  Sattler glares at him.  Dulaney smirks. \nMAN (confused) What's the state nickname? \nDULANEY (dryly) The Beaver State. \nEXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY \nRows of new Town Houses line the street.  Dulaney drives up and walks towards the front door of one of them.  He KNOCKS. JOANNE BRASLOW answers.  She stares at Dulaney innocently. \nINT.  JOANNE'S TOWN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nSparsely decorated.  Very trendy.  High tech furniture and designer lights.  Joanne sits on the couch -- Dulaney on one of the chairs.  There is COFFEE on the table. \nJOANNE I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along. \nDULANEY What changed? \nJOANNE He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well... \nJoanne stops as emotion fills her.  Her eyes well with tears. \nDULANEY You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you? \nJOANNE I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca. \nDULANEY I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much? \nJOANNE I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it. \nDULANEY If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder? \nJOANNE Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had. \nDULANEY How do you know what kind of sex they had? \nJOANNE I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place. \nDULANEY Did Mr. Marsh use drugs? \nJOANNE No. \nDULANEY What about Miss Lawson? \nJOANNE Yes -- cocaine. \nDulaney is shocked by this. \nDULANEY How do you know that? \nJOANNE I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial. \nDulaney looks like he's been kicked in the stomach. \nJOANNE Is something wrong. \nA beat.  Dulaney looks at her slowly. DULANEY What?  No -- nothing.  Thank you for your time. \nHe gets up and walks to the door.  Joanne stands and stares after him with a trace of a grin. \nINT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - DAY \n", "test1_true": "DULANEY You lied to me! \nREBECCA What? \nDULANEY I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house! \nREBECCA She's mistaken. \nDULANEY (Yelling) That's not good enough, Goddamit! \nREBECCA It isn't true.  You have to believe me. \nDULANEY No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them. \nREBECCA I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying. \nDULANEY Why would she lie? \nREBECCA I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out? \nDulaney is confused, struggling to decide if he believes her. \nINT.  LAUNDRY ROOM, DULANEY HOUSE - DAY \nSharon is getting a load of washing ready.  She picks up one of Dulaney's tee shirts and notices several thin stripes of BLOOD near the shoulder. \nINT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY \nRAIN falls.  Dulaney enters the room to find Michael on the PHONE.  Dulaney appears nervous -- anxious. \nDULANEY Michael -- get off the phone. \nMICHAEL Why? \nDULANEY (impatiently) Because I'm expecting a call. \nMICHAEL -- But it's Sunday. \nDULANEY (snapping) I know what day it is!  Get off the phone. \nMICHAEL (hurt; into phone) I gotta go.  I'll call you later. \nMichael hangs up and leaves the room.  Dulaney stares at the phone -- struggling against himself.  He picks it up and dials. \nREBECCA'S VOICE This is Rebecca Lawson.  I'm not in right now.  So if you please leave a message-- \nDulaney slams down the phone.  He checks his watch. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDulaney wears another tee shirt as he sleeps.  Sharon is awake, staring up at the ceiling.  A beat.  She rolls over and carefully lifts up Dulaney's tee shirt.  She sees the scratches on his back.  She does not wake him.  She just lays there, deep in thought. \nINT.  HALLWAY, COURTHOUSE - MORNING \nRebecca walks down the hall.  In the b.g. we see Dulaney walking quickly to join her. \nDULANEY I called you all weekend.  Where were you? \nREBECCA I went out on the boat. \nDULANEY (concerned) Alone? \nREBECCA Of course. \nINT.  COURTROOM - MORNING \nThe gallery is crowded with REPORTERS and SPECTATORS.  Dulaney sits beside Rebecca at the defense table.  Cardenas stands before the jury. \nDulaney and Cardenas are seated at their respective tables. Rebecca sits beside Dulaney.  She is wearing a beautiful, well tailored dress.  She looks beautiful and has surprisingly made no attempt to down-play her looks. \n", "test2_input": "CARDENAS Did you ever see her again after that? \nDR. PALEY Yes -- several times. \nCARDENAS What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson? \nDR. PALEY We stopped seeing each other. \nCARDENAS Why? \nDR. PALEY Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me. \nCARDENAS What kind of information? \nDR. PALEY She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart. \nWHISPERS from the crowd fill the room. \nCARDENAS Did you suggest any? \nDR. PALEY Yes -- Insulin and others. \nCARDENAS What did she say? \nDR. PALEY She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high. \nCARDENAS -- And what did you suggest? \nDR. PALEY Cocaine. \nMore GASPS from the crowd.  Rebecca's remains calm, but her eyes glare at Paley hatefully. \nCARDENAS (to Dulaney) Your witness. \nCardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Paley with a smile. \nDULANEY Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson? \nDR. PALEY We had dinner at a restaurant. \nDULANEY Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot? \nDR. PALEY No. \nDULANEY You didn't grab her and try to kiss her? \nDR. PALEY No. \nDULANEY If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence. \nPaley thinks for a moment.  He is nervous. \nDR. PALEY Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument. \nDULANEY And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not. \nDR. PALEY (hesitantly) Yes. \nDULANEY And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson? \nDR. PALEY No. \nDulaney walks back to his desk and removes a TAPE PLAYER from a cardboard box. \nDULANEY Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now. \nCARDENAS Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made. \nDulaney takes out two pieces of PAPER and approaches the bench. \n", "test2_true": "Judge Burnham studies the paper. \nJUDGE BURNHAM I'll allow it. \nDulaney walks back to his desk and presses the PLAY BUTTON.  We HEAR a BEEP, then... \nDR. PALEY'S VOICE Rebecca -- I know you're there, Godammit.  Answer the phone, you bitch!  You can't treat me like this! \nWe HEAR a PHONE slam down.  Another BEEP. \nDR. PALEY'S VOICE You want to play games with me?  Who the fuck do you think you are? Okay - - we'll play.  You'll be sorry. \nDulaney stops the machine.  He takes a dramatic pause, letting the words on the tape sink in. \nCardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration. Dulaney approaches Paley who is now very nervous. \nDULANEY (quoting) You'll be sorry? \nDR. PALEY I was angry. \nDULANEY You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson? \nDR. PALEY No -- she asked me about cocaine. \nDULANEY I suggest it never happened. \nDR. PALEY (angrily) You can suggest anything you want. It happened. \nDULANEY No further questions. \nDr. Paley's temper explodes.  He is a loose cannon. \nDR. PALEY I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself. \nDULANEY That's all Dr. Paley. \nINT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - EVENING \nRAIN FALLS, streaking along the bedroom windows.  CANDLES light the room.  Dulaney and Rebecca are on the bed.  She sits on top of him, writhing back and forth -- lost in the rhythm of their love making. \nCLOSE ON DULANEY - LATER \nHe is asleep, laying on his back -- the sheets pulled up to his waist.  LIGHTNING FLASHES outside -- a CLAP of THUNDER follows. He stirs and wakes up. \nHIS POV \nAnother FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates Rebecca, who is standing over him in a sexy silk ROBE.  Dulaney starts to sit up but something restrains him.  He is HANDCUFFED to the BRASS HEAD BOARD. \nDULANEY What the...  What are you doing? \nShe sits next to him -- looks at him fondly -- gently strokes his face with her hand. \nDULANEY (nervously) Rebecca -- take these off. \nREBECCA Tonight we open new doors. \nShe slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach -- to his chest.  Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Rebecca picks up a LARGE CANDLE on the nightstand and moves it slowly -- back and forth over his chest. \nDULANEY What are you going you doing? \nREBECCA Are you scared? \nHe doesn't answer.  He doesn't have to.  She can see the fear in his eyes.  She tilts the candle -- a stream of WAX pours out on his chest.  Dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on the bed, his hands straining against his restraints. \nShe smiles -- a wicked smile, then pours more wax, making a thin trail of LITTLE BEADS that moves down his chest towards his stomach.  Dulaney's face cringes.  He stares at her through eyes filled with fear. \nREBECCA (whispering) I love you, Frank.  I love your strength -- be strong for me now. \nShe continues to pour the wax in little BEADS, filling his navel and working her way towards his groin. \n", "test3_input": "Dulaney, Sharon and Michael sit at the table eating dinner. There is a tense silence.  Although Michael does not know what is going on he can sense the tension.  The DOORBELL RINGS. \nDULANEY I'll get it. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nDulaney answers the front door and Biggs rushes in excited. \nBIGGS I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news? \nDULANEY You got something on the Coke? \nBiggs grins. \nBIGGS Do I?  I talked to one of the dealers I put the word out to.  He's been following the trial pretty closely. He said at one time he wanted to be a lawyer before he became a dealer. \nDULANEY Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon? \nBIGGS Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years? \nDulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesn't have a clue. \nBIGGS Marsh's secretary -- Joanne Braslow. \nConfusion fills Dulaney's face. \nINT.  COURTROOM - MORNING \nCourt is in session.  Rebecca looks around the courtroom, trying to get a feel of the CROWD'S opinion.  Dulaney is not there.  She looks at the door anxiously.  The rooms waits.  A beat.  Dulaney enters -- sits beside Rebecca -- but acts as if she isn't there. \nINT.  COURTROOM - LATER \nDulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an ORIENTAL MAN in his thirties. \nDULANEY Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice? \nDR. WONG Oriental medicine. \nDULANEY --And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours? \nDR. WONG Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year. \nDULANEY Why does she come to you? \nDR. WONG She suffers from severe menstrual cramps. \nDULANEY Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps? \nDR. WONG Yes. \nDULANEY What did you prescribe for her? \nDR. WONG Chinese peony root. \nDULANEY Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like? \nDR. WONG It's a white powder that comes in a vial. \nThere is a MOAN from the CROWD.  Cardenas looks at Troxell. \nDULANEY How do you instruct your patients to take it? \nDR. WONG I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water. \nDULANEY A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug? \nDr. Wong checks his records. \nDR. WONG October twenty-seventh. \n", "test3_true": "DR. WONG Yes -- quite easy. \nDULANEY (to Cardenas) Your witness. \nCardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this witness. \nCARDENAS No questions. \nJUDGE BURNHAM You may call your next witness. \nDULANEY The defense calls Miss Margaret Sellers. \nCardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her mid twenties approach the stand. \nDULANEY AND MISS SELLERS \nMiss Sellers appears a little nervous.  Dulaney smiles warmly. \nDULANEY Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley? \nMISS SELLERS Yes. \nDULANEY Where did you meet him? \nMISS SELLERS I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there. \nDULANEY What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley. \nMISS SELLERS We dated for about a month last year. \nDULANEY Then what happened? \nMISS SELLERS I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it. \nDULANEY -- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him? \nMISS SELLERS He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable. \nDULANEY Did he make your life miserable? \nMISS SELLERS Yes -- he did. \nDULANEY How? \nCardenas stands again. \nCARDENAS Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley. \nDULANEY Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Objection overruled.  The witness will answer the question. \nMISS SELLERS He'd call me in the middle of the night.  Show up at my house and bang on the door.  Finally after two weeks I went to his office one day to tell him to stop. \nDULANEY What did he say? \nMISS SELLERS He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over. \nDULANEY Do you remember his exact words? \nMISS SELLERS Yes.  He said, \"If you want to play games, we'll play -- and you'll be sorry.\" \nAnother BUZZ from the CROWD.   Cardenas inwardly cringes. \nDULANEY What happened next? \nMISS SELLERS While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs. \nDULANEY What happened? \n"}

{"test1_input": "An old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake.  Dulaney and Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it. \nREBECCA I figured if we have to talk all day we might as well do it someplace nice. \n(looks at the cabin) Isn't it beautiful? \nDULANEY Yeah. \nREBECCA (sadly) Andrew loved this old cabin. (fondly remembering) He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum. (a sad smile) I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it. \nHer mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant memory. \nREBECCA (snapping out of it) Sorry. \nDULANEY It's okay. \nEXT.  LAKE, FURTHER - DUSK \nDulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore.  A soft wind blows through her hair. \nDULANEY Tell me about Doctor Paley? \nREBECCA I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me. \nDULANEY It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off. \nREBECCA (confidently) It won't be that hard. \nShe walks off. \nEXT.  CABIN - DUSK \nDulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing. \nREBECCA Did you always want to be a lawyer? \nDULANEY No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player. \nREBECCA Really? \nDULANEY Yeah. \nREBECCA That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened? \nDULANEY I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream. \nREBECCA It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want? \nDulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light of the setting sun.  Their eyes meet.  He starts to lean in towards her -- then stops.  He gets up and walks away. \nEXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING \nRebecca's car pulls up in front.  Dulaney gets out. \nREBECCA I'm going to put the car away.  You can let yourself in.  There's a key under the flower pot. \nRebecca drives to the rear of the building.  Dulaney walks to the door.  He lifts the FLOWER POT -- removes a KEY -- opens the door and goes inside. \nANGLE - DOWN THE STREET \nDetective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house.  He glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad. \nINT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nRebecca walks over to the STEREO and turns on the CASSETTE PLAYER.  The room fills with soft, sexy MUSIC.  Dulaney stands in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move. \nREBECCA Yes -- it would be nice. \nDULANEY What would? \n", "test1_true": "DULANEY Is that what you think I was thinking? \nREBECCA No -- that's what I know you were thinking. \nBefore Dulaney can start to protest she continues.  She slowly walks behind him.  Dulaney stares straight ahead. \nREBECCA How often do you make love to your wife, Frank?  Once a week?  Sometimes twice?  There once was passion, wasn't there?  But now it's bland, predictable.  Tell me, when you do it -- do you always think of her?  Or do you wonder what it would be like to be with someone else?  Someone wild. Someone who would force you to lose control. \nHer words strip his thoughts bare.  He is vulnerable. \nREBECCA (continuing) There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank. \nDULANEY You take a lot for granted. \nDulaney starts for the door.  Rebecca's cool exterior fades, giving way to her vulnerable side. \nREBECCA Please stay, Frank.  I don't want to be alone.  I don't expect anything from you -- no demands -- no complications.  I just need to feel close to someone. \nDulaney turns back towards her.  A beat.  He thinks for a moment, then walks back into the room.  Rebecca smiles warmly, invitingly. \nREBECCA I'll be back in a minute.  Help yourself to a drink. \nShe disappears down the hall.  Dulaney stands were he is, wondering what he is doing there.  He walks over to the BAR and pours a SCOTCH.  He looks down the hall. \nHIS POV - REBECCA'S BEDROOM \nThe bedroom door is open.  The room is DARK -- Lit only by the moon.  Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head. MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her.  She runs her hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her round, full breasts.  She stops for a moment -- and we sense she knows Dulaney is watching her. \nDulaney stares at her -- mesmerized.  He knows he should turn away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look. \nOne by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing her sheer, white panties.  She bends forward slightly and slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of them. \nWe can see the desire on Dulaney's face.  He looks away.  The conflict inside him grows.  He looks back. \nRebecca walks into the hall.  She is barefoot --  wearing a long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's.  If she wasn't aware he was watching her before -- she is now.  It doesn't seem to bother her.  She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes inviting his. \nDulaney moves towards her.  They meet in the middle of the room.  She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can smell her.  She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to bring his lips to hers.  The longing overcomes him.  He kisses her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back.  She bites his lip. \nREBECCA (whispering) My way. \nDulaney ignores her.  He tries to kiss her again.  She turns her head away. \nShe walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door. Dulaney follows.  He tries the door -- it's locked.  He starts to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room. He starts to leave -- stops.  He looks at the bedroom door. His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him.  He moves quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination.  He breaks the door open with his shoulder. \nRebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting for him.  He moves to her.  She can see the fire in his eyes. He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly -- feeding his craving for her. \nREBECCA My way. \nHe is lost within her now and doesn't hear her.  She pulls his hair, jerking his head back.  Her eyes command him to follow her demand. \nSomething in him snaps -- a new door opens.  He pushes her back onto the DRESSING CABINET.  He kisses her, running his hand up her thighs, hiking up her dress.  She wraps her legs around his waist.  They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and bottles to the floor.  He lifts her -- carries her to the bed - - lays her down and rips her dress from her body.  Their passion is unleased.  They grope and claw for one another hungrily.  She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the shoulder.  His face tenses from the pain, but he MOANS with pleasure. \nINT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDark.  Sharon is asleep.  The door opens and Dulaney enters quietly.  He walks towards the bathroom. \nINT.  DULANEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nDulaney splashes a handful of water across his face.  He unbuttons his shirt and takes it off -- wincing as he does.  He turns his back to the mirror.  Several deep FINGERNAIL SCRAPES are dug into his back.  He looks at himself in the mirror. \nINT.  HALLWAY, LAW OFFICES - MORNING \nDulaney and Biggs walk down the hall to a water cooler.  Biggs pours himself a glass. \nBIGGS Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke. \nDULANEY You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie. \nBIGGS I'm trying. \n", "test1_id": 2706, "test2_input": "JOANNE Yes. \nDULANEY It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you. \nJOANNE I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him. \nDulaney studies her. \nJOANNE (continuing) I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will. \nDULANEY Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow. \nDulaney walks off.  Joanne stares after him.  Her face is cold, showing no sign of emotion. \nINT.  COURTROOM - DAY \nDulaney sits beside Rebecca, but he seems distant.  Cardenas stands up. \nCARDENAS The State calls Jeffery Roston. \nAs soon as she hears the name Rebecca's face becomes tense, nervous.  Dulaney notices it.  He checks a list. \nDULANEY Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness. \nCARDENAS The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago. \nJudge Burnham motions for Dulaney and Cardenas to approach the bench. \nCARDENAS Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier? \nCARDENAS He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony. \nDULANEY But Your Honor-- \nJUDGE BURNHAM That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat. \nDulaney walks back to his chair.  Rebecca appears genuinely nervous. \nINT.  COURTROOM - LATER \nCardenas stands before ROSTON a handsome man with salt and pepper hair in his late fifties. \nCARDENAS Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson? \nROSTON We were lovers. \nCARDENAS How long were you together? \nROSTON For about one year. \nCARDENAS How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson? \nROSTON Intense. \nCARDENAS I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific? \nROSTON It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition. \nCARDENAS What kind of condition are you referring to? \nROSTON I had a bad heart. \nThere is an AUDIBLE GASP from the crowd.  Cardenas waits, giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of Roston's last statement. \nDulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded.  He tries to control his surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't.  He stares ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the testimony. \n", "test2_true": "ROSTON I had bypass surgery. \nCARDENAS And how are you now? \nROSTON Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man. \nCARDENAS How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery? \nROSTON It didn't. \nCARDENAS Why not? \nROSTON She left me. \nDulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca.  The anger and his sense of betrayal show on his face. \nCARDENAS Why did she say she was leaving? \nROSTON She didn't.  She just left. \nCARDENAS Why do you think she left you? \nROSTON Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that... \nIt takes Dulaney a few seconds to object to the question.  He is clearly preoccupied with the implications of Roston's testimony. \nDULANEY Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness. \nCARDENAS Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson. \nDULANEY The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Objection sustained. \nCARDENAS Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving? \nDULANEY Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning. \nCARDENAS When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean? \nROSTON It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors. \nCARDENAS Can you give the court an example? \nROSTON It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way. \nThis strikes a chord with Dulaney. \nROSTON (continuing) It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is. \nCARDENAS What would she do that made it hard to resist? \nROSTON She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I felt she could read my mind.  It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted.  A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had handcuffed me to the bed. \nThere are a few SNICKERS from the crowd.  Dulaney is thinking about the familiarity of Roston's testimony.  Judge Burnham BANGS his GAVEL.  The crowd becomes silent. \nROSTON She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen. \nCARDENAS What did she say? \nRoston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of his life. \nCARDENAS Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did. \nROSTON She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before. \nMore noise from the Crowd.  Judge Burnham is annoyed.  He BANGS his gavel again. \n", "test2_id": 2707, "test3_input": "Dulaney, Sharon and Michael sit at the table eating dinner. There is a tense silence.  Although Michael does not know what is going on he can sense the tension.  The DOORBELL RINGS. \nDULANEY I'll get it. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nDulaney answers the front door and Biggs rushes in excited. \nBIGGS I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news? \nDULANEY You got something on the Coke? \nBiggs grins. \nBIGGS Do I?  I talked to one of the dealers I put the word out to.  He's been following the trial pretty closely. He said at one time he wanted to be a lawyer before he became a dealer. \nDULANEY Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon? \nBIGGS Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years? \nDulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesn't have a clue. \nBIGGS Marsh's secretary -- Joanne Braslow. \nConfusion fills Dulaney's face. \nINT.  COURTROOM - MORNING \nCourt is in session.  Rebecca looks around the courtroom, trying to get a feel of the CROWD'S opinion.  Dulaney is not there.  She looks at the door anxiously.  The rooms waits.  A beat.  Dulaney enters -- sits beside Rebecca -- but acts as if she isn't there. \nINT.  COURTROOM - LATER \nDulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an ORIENTAL MAN in his thirties. \nDULANEY Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice? \nDR. WONG Oriental medicine. \nDULANEY --And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours? \nDR. WONG Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year. \nDULANEY Why does she come to you? \nDR. WONG She suffers from severe menstrual cramps. \nDULANEY Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps? \nDR. WONG Yes. \nDULANEY What did you prescribe for her? \nDR. WONG Chinese peony root. \nDULANEY Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like? \nDR. WONG It's a white powder that comes in a vial. \nThere is a MOAN from the CROWD.  Cardenas looks at Troxell. \nDULANEY How do you instruct your patients to take it? \nDR. WONG I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water. \nDULANEY A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug? \nDr. Wong checks his records. \nDR. WONG October twenty-seventh. \n", "test3_true": "DR. WONG Yes -- quite easy. \nDULANEY (to Cardenas) Your witness. \nCardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this witness. \nCARDENAS No questions. \nJUDGE BURNHAM You may call your next witness. \nDULANEY The defense calls Miss Margaret Sellers. \nCardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her mid twenties approach the stand. \nDULANEY AND MISS SELLERS \nMiss Sellers appears a little nervous.  Dulaney smiles warmly. \nDULANEY Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley? \nMISS SELLERS Yes. \nDULANEY Where did you meet him? \nMISS SELLERS I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there. \nDULANEY What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley. \nMISS SELLERS We dated for about a month last year. \nDULANEY Then what happened? \nMISS SELLERS I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it. \nDULANEY -- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him? \nMISS SELLERS He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable. \nDULANEY Did he make your life miserable? \nMISS SELLERS Yes -- he did. \nDULANEY How? \nCardenas stands again. \nCARDENAS Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley. \nDULANEY Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women. \nJUDGE BURNHAM Objection overruled.  The witness will answer the question. \nMISS SELLERS He'd call me in the middle of the night.  Show up at my house and bang on the door.  Finally after two weeks I went to his office one day to tell him to stop. \nDULANEY What did he say? \nMISS SELLERS He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over. \nDULANEY Do you remember his exact words? \nMISS SELLERS Yes.  He said, \"If you want to play games, we'll play -- and you'll be sorry.\" \nAnother BUZZ from the CROWD.   Cardenas inwardly cringes. \nDULANEY What happened next? \nMISS SELLERS While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs. \nDULANEY What happened? \n", "test3_id": 2708}

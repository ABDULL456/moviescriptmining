DOMINIC In special case studies, medical research groups used roman numerals to identify test inmates. 
FINCH Five is the letter V.  Brilliant, Dominic. 
Finch slides in front of his computer. 
FINCH All we need is Larkhill's employment records. 
INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM 
The covers pulled protectively up around her, Delia rests in a light, uneasy sleep. 
Suddenly, an eye pops open as she awakens, catching a familiar scent.  She slowly sits up and inhales. 
DELIA Roses. 
She closes her eyes. 
DELIA It's you, isn't it?  You've come to kill me. 
From the shadows, V answers. 
V Yes. 
Tears begin to streak her face. 
DELIA Oh thank god.  Thank god. 
INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE - THE NOSE 
Dominic hangs over Finch's shoulder as Larkhill's employment record comes up. 
Finch's mouth falls open. 
FINCH Oh my god. 
Row after row of names scroll by at the end of each bio are the words: deceased, file closed. 
FINCH Oh bloody hell. 
The data banks unfurl like a mass grave. 
DOMINIC He's killed them all?  It's not possible. 
Finch stops, staring at the one name whose file is not closed -- 
FINCH Oh no. 
Dr. Delia Surridge. 
INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM 
V floats on the edge of the room's shadows, a dark angel. 
V Are you afraid? 
DELIA No, no.  I thought I would be, but I'm not.  I'm -- 
She looks at the hovering, smiling mask. 
DELIA Relieved. 
She starts to cry again. 
DELIA Oh god, all these years.  All this waiting.  And somehow I always knew you'd come back. 
Delia thinks back. 
DELIA When I saw you that night -- the night you escaped, you were standing against the flames and you looked straight at me. 
The mask almost nods. 
DELIA I knew then that one day you'd come looking for me, that you'd find me. 
Her voice drops to an almost confessional whisper. 
DELIA What -- what happened at Larkhill. What we did -- What I did.  That terrible knowledge, it's been with me so long.  That I could do things like that. 
Delia rubs the salty tears from her eyes. 
DELIA For years, I blamed it on the government, on the authority I could never stand up to.  But living so long with the knowledge of what I did has made me understand otherwise.  I alone was accountable. 
V watches her. 
DELIA There is something wrong with us. With all of mankind.  With me. Something evil that made me enjoy what I did.  Some hideous flaw. 
Her voice almost trails off. 
DELIA We deserve to be culled.  We deserve it. 
INT.  ALMOND BEDROOM 
Light sweeps across Rosemary from the opening bedroom door as she sobs softly in bed.  Derek enters, holding a bottle of whiskey and his clean gun. 
She sits up as Derek looms over her. 
ROSEMARY Derek?  What? 
He lifts the gun into her bruised face.  Her eyebrows cringe as he slowly pulls the trigger. 
DEREK Bang. 
Click.  It is empty. 
DEREK Don't worry, Rose.  I didn't load it. 
The phone rings. 
DEREK Not tonight. 
He grins evilly at her and answers the bedside phone.

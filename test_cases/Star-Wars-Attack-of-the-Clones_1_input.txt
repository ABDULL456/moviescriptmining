She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause. 
ANAKIN May I tell you something? 
PADME I don't know. 
ANAKIN Then how can I tell you? 
PADME Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition. 
ANAKIN It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you. 
PADME Anakin, don't... 
ANAKIN From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask... 
Silence. The logs flame in the hearth. 
ANAKIN (continuing) If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me. 
PADME ...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible. 
ANAKIN Anything's possible. Padme, please listen... 
PADME You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other. 
ANAKIN Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that. 
PADME Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me. 
ANAKIN I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't. 
PADME I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love. 
There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking. 
ANAKIN It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret. 
PADME Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that? 
Silence for a moment. 
ANAKIN ...No, you're right. It would destroy us. 
EXT. SPACE It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet. 
EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world. 
The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face. 
TAUN WE Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi. 
OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes. 
TAUN WE Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you. 
OBI-WAN (warily) I'm expected? 
TAUN WE Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this way! 
OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor. 
Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light. 
TAUN WE May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi... 
OBI-WAN Obi-Wan Kenobi.

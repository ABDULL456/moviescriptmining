36   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - HOUR LATER                        36 Dwight has recovered his good mood. Dressed in a marksman's coat with a padded shoulder, Dwight is laughing as he attempts to assemble Toby's Winchester .22. (CONTINUED) 
36   CONTINUED:                                              36 DWIGHT 'Turkey shoot' is just a figure of speech. TOBY There's no real turkey? DWIGHT No, it's just regulation paper targets. It's a test of skill. (a beat) And, Jack, I just found out yesterday that they won't let kids shoot. 
TOBY But you said I could! DWIGHT I know, but they got it all screwed up somehow and told me wrong at first. Toby starts to argue, but Caroline touches his arm. CAROLINE Dwight, you did tell him. DWIGHT (an edge) I don't make the rules, Caroline. If I made the rules, I might make different ones, but I don't make the rules. 
37   EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY                                         37 A sullen Toby stands with Pearl. Dwight is giving his name and the entry fee to a MAN. As the Man moves away, Caroline stops him and holds out some money. CAROLINE Wolff.   Caroline Wolff. MAN You mean you want to enter? I think it's against the rules. (CONTINUED) 
37   CONTINUED:                                             37 CAROLINE Well, that sign says this is an N.R.A. club, and I'm a dues-paying N.R.A. member. That gives me the right to participate in the activities of other chapters. MAN You'll be the only woman shooting. Caroline just smiles. The Man shrugs, takes her money and writes down her name. 
38   EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY                                    38 
The shooting match has begun. The contestants have ten turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bull's-eye fifty yards away. The scores and rankings are on a portable scoreboard. A contestant finishes SHOOTING. There is a pause. Everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the concrete wall on which the bull's-eye hangs. The score comes:     84. There is a smattering of applause, and it's Dwight's turn. From his stance, Dwight looks as if he is a pretty good shot. He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe. A pause, and then his score is raised: 73. Dwight smiles an inappropriate smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline. 
There are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her position, and someone in the crowd yells out, "Oh, Mama, shake that thang!" Caroline ignores it, taking her shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and professional-looking. She SHOOTS her TEN BULLETS, taking time to breathe once, deeply, between each shot. The pause, and her score is raised: 93. There is a moment of surprised silence, and then the crowd gives Caroline a sincere round of applause. 
SAME SCENE - LATER Dwight looks stunned, and Toby is almost equally surprised. (CONTINUED)

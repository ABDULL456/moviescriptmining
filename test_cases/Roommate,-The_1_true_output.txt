(BEAT) So, how's Jason? I really liked him. 
SARA We broke up. 
IRENE Yeah ...he sucked. 
INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT - LATER 
Sara stuffs her new clothes into her tiny closet. The bags spill out into the room, taking up floor space. Rebecca sits on her bed, her laptop open. She's staring at Irene's Facebook Profile. There are some racy pictures of Irene and some girlfriends. 
REBECCA Hey. What're those? 
SARA Irene gave them to me. She had a lot more but we don't have the room. 
REBECCA Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles, huh? 
SARA Well, maybe that's not a problem. 
REBECCA Really? 
SARA Yeah. She actually suggested that I move in with her. 
REBECCA What? 
(BEAT) You want to move? 
SARA No, of course not. I love living here... with you. Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a bright spin on things. 
SARA Look, I'd still technically be living here. So you wouldn't have to get a new roommate. Her place is huge and it's not like you couldn't use the extra closet space. I'd just move some of my stuff over, and spend a few nights a week there. We'd both have a lot more space. 
REBECCA I don't want more space. I want... She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence. 
SARA Nothing's set in stone. It's just something to think about. Plus we'd be able to keep Cuddles. As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares across the room at... Cuddles. 
EXT. QUADS - DAY 
As Sara crosses the quads, she spots Tracy up ahead, walking by herself. 
SARA Tracy! Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she didn't hear anything. Sara hurries to catch up with her. 
SARA Tracy... hey. 
TRACY Oh, hey. Tracy smiles, but weakly. The girl's lost all her sparkle. Her eyes dart around nervously, like a bird's. 
SARA I heard you changed dorms. 
TRACY Yeah, Conrad Hall. Seemed like a better vibe. 
SARA Well, we should get together. Like grab a bite or something. Right? 
REBECCA (O.S.) Sara! Sara turns and waves at Rebecca. 
SARA Hi. Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara. 
TRACY 
(TO SARA) I'll call you. But she's already walking away. 
SARA Tracy?! 
REBECCA What was that about? 
SARA I don't know. She just walked away. 
REBECCA Well, she's always been a flake.

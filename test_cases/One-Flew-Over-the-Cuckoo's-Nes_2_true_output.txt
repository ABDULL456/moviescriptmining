SEFELT McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped... 
HARDING When? 
SEFELT Yesterday... 
HARDING Who told you that? 
SEFELT Gary Blinker... 
SCANLON Gary Blinker's fulla shit! 
MARTINI He's not! 
SCANLON He is! 
Harding slams his card down on the table, rises and crosses to the nurses' station where he taps on the side window. 
Big Nurse gets up, crosses to the window and slides it open. 
BIG NURSE Yes, Mister Harding? 
HARDING Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday? 
BIG NURSE No. Mister Harding, that is not true. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 
Bromden is squatting, leaning against the wall near the security gate to the visitors' room, when a KEY HITS THE LOCK. He looks up expectantly. This time it is McMurphy. Or what was McMurphy, for his head is bandaged, and his tongue hangs out of his mouth as he is led across the visitors' room by an ATTENDANT. 
McMurphy shows Bromden no sign of recognition, which Bromden pays no attention to, thinking McMurphy is putting on the same act he did when he came back from Electro-Shock Therapy. 
Bromden joyously turns and runs down the hallway to the day room. 
INT. DAY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
as Bromden crosses into the day room, gets a seat, and sits facing the hallway, bursting with expectation. 
A long beat, then the Attendant appears with McMurphy and taps at the side door to the nurses' station. 
The Acutes break off their card game and look at McMurphy; their faces hang open at his appearance. 
Big Nurse crosses to the side door, opens it, and steps out into the day room. To the Attendant as she takes McMurphy by the arm: 
BIG NURSE Thank you... 
ATTENDANT Yes, ma'am... 
The Attendant exits. 
BIG NURSE (to McMurphy) Now, let's find you a place to sit, shall we, Mister McMurphy? 
Big Nurse gently guides McMurphy to a seat on the Chronics' side of the room. 
Bromden can hardly contain himself as he waits for McMurphy to go into his act. 
The Acutes have already absorbed the reality of McMurphy's condition as they exchange looks with each other. 
FREDRICKSON (whispering) Lobotomy... 
HARDING Yeah... 
SCANLON Yeah, that Gary Blinker is fulla shit... 
The Acutes turn back to their card game as Harding shuffles and deals the cards out. 
Bromden keeps his eyes glued to Big Nurse and McMurphy. 
BIG NURSE (sitting McMurphy down) Here now, you sit here... That's it... 
Big Nurse pats McMurphy's face and crosses back to the nurses' station. 
McMurphy just sits there, his head lolling to one side. 
Bromden waits for McMurphy to go into his routine. 
McMurphy just sits there. 
Bromden snaps his fingers and slaps his thigh, then waits for McMurphy to follow suit. 
McMurphy just sits there slobbering. 
Bromden slaps his thigh again. 
No response from McMurphy. 
The MUSIC PLAYS ON. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MEN'S DORM - DAYBREAK 
as Bromden stands by the window looking out. A long beat, then he turns into the room and looks around.

118 EXT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - DAY                                   118 
A huge collection of paparazzi SNAPPERS and Journalist HACKS is camped outside the hotel. 
Immediately a surge of activity, "Here he is"... 
A burst of flashlights and a volley of questions from the JOURNALISTS as JAMES - gets out of the taxi and runs the gauntlet of humiliation... 
...into the hotel..

121 INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY                                         121 
A large hotel suite. There are flowers everywhere. Newspapers are all over the table. 
JAMES sits opposite SUZY. He sees an expensive gift; recently opened. A diamond necklace.. 
JAMES That from him? 
SUZY nods. Even the uninitiated eye can tell: it's worth a fortune. 
(CONTINUED) 121 CONTINUED:                                                    121 
SUZY Why have you come here, James? 
JAMES To get you back. 
SUZY You don't want me back...you never wanted to be married in the first place. You did it because you hoped it might change you...settle you down... help with the racing. Not because you loved me. And who knows, if it had been just the drinking, or the dope, or the infidelity, or the moods...it might even have worked...but when it's all of them? 
JAMES I know. I'm terrible. 
SUZY No, you're not terrible. You're just...who you are...at this point in your life. And God help anyone that wants more. 
JAMES Will he be able to give you more? He has quite the bad boy reputation himself. 
SUZY What's important is how it feels to me. And it feels like he adores me. 
A flicker behind JAMES's eyes. Failure. 
JAMES Right. 
SUZY He's aware of the delicacy of the situation, and how it looks. Having raided your larder. Plundered your safe. Smash and grab, and so forth. So he's assured me he'll take care of the financial side. And will be very generous. 
JAMES manages a brave smile. 
JAMES Fine. I'll give him a call. 
(CONTINUED) 121 CONTINUED: (2)                                                121 
SUZY No. His lawyers will contact you. 
JAMES notices the vast unmade bed. Where, until recently, two people had slept. 
121AEXT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - DAY                                  121A 
JAMES emerges from the hotel - into the storm of paparazzi again. He manages a brave smile... 
JAMES It's all very amicable. My wife has found herself a new backer...I mean lover...which makes her happy.. (laughter) Mr. Burton has found a way of feeling young again...let's hope his pockets are deep...they'll need to be... (laughter) And I've found a way to be single again without it costing me a penny, which has to go down as the biggest win of my career. 
Laughter from the JOURNALISTS who are hungrily writing down the copy. But JAMES's hollow smile fools no one... 
122 INT. JUMBO JET - FIRST CLASS - DAY                             122 
JAMES sits alone in the first class section. A loser on the track, and a loser in love, too. Being played out in the full glare of publicity. On the front pages. Being read by everyone on the plane. 
A STEWARDESS looks over, catches his eye. Smiles. 
123 INT. JUMBO JET - WC - DAY                                      123 
JAMES and the STEWARDESS fucking. Hard. 
Nothing to do with pleasure. An analgesic - a way of blocking out the pain. JAMES catches his own reflection in the mirror. Teeth clenched. Eyes burning with anger and self-loathing... 
OVER THIS: we fade in the ROAR of car engines... 
123AINT. FRENCH GP 1976 - PAUL RICARD - 4TH JULY 1976             123A 
JAMES's teeth still clenched. Eyes still burning with anger. Driving flat out. At the limit. 
(CONTINUED) 123ACONTINUED:                                                   123A 
Suzy's words still ringing in his ears. 
Make that beyond the limit. At the point of no return. The car shaking. Weaving recklessly through other cars...

HARVEY MILK I ask this... If there should be an assassination, I would hope that five, ten, one hundred, a thousand would rise. I would like to see every gay lawyer, every gay architect come out-- 
159 EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE 1978 - CONTINUOUS 
Walking back out onto the street, Anne and Scott turn to look down Market Street, the camera pans and drifts to reveal: 
A MASSIVE CANDLELIGHT MARCH. CLEVE JONES LEADS TENS OF THOUSANDS of San Franciscans of every religion, nationality, sexuality, all of the familiar faces and many new ones... THEY ALL MARCH SILENTLY up Market Street to the palace Harvey dreamed could be his own: City Hall. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) --If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door... And that's all. I ask for the movement to continue. Because it's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power... it's about the "us's" out there. Not only gays, but the Blacks, the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us's. Without hope, the us's give up-- As the thousands of mourners arrive at City Hall, they place their candles around the statue of Lincoln. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) --I know you cannot live on hope alone, but without it, life is not worth living. So you, and you, and you...

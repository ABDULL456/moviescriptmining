INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY 
Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console as he speaks to Plato. 
MASTER MIND (into phone) A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. I love it. 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
PLATO Then you are absolutely going to love this - 
We follow Plato's line of sight across the street where we see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN. 
PLATO - He volunteers at a school for the blind. 
INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY 
Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair. 
MASTER MIND He volunteers. He doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul. 
EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY 
From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child who's sitting on a rock. But up close... 
HAL You greedy little bastard. I already gave you a twenty. 
BLIND KID Hey, you want me to play along? Then pay up, bitch! 
HAL Fine, but you better be convincing. 
He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them. 
HAL Here she comes, go to work. 
Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his hands and begins to cry. 
BLIND KID (weeping) Why can't I see! Why God? 
Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder. 
HAL Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me look at you. 
The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance. 
The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark sunglasses - he should get an Oscar. 
HAL You know, in life we're all given no more than we can bear. This happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it - Maybe to be an inspiration to the other little Peteys out there. 
BLIND KID You really think so, Hal? 
HAL Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying? Now c'mon, go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended. 
The boy stands up and is about to take off. 
HAL Petey, wait a minute. 
Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the boy's face before sending him on his way. 
The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to absolutely melt. 
HAL Don't run into anything! 
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should be next in line for popehood. 
PLATO I think I've seen enough, sir. This is your guy. 
MASTER MIND (O.S.) (over radio) Then return to base. We have much work to do. 
Plato starts up the van and pulls away. 
INT. BAR - DAY 
It's a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting pool as the bartender slings drinks. 
Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him. 
As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly catches himself on the bar's TELEVISION - it's a story about how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site. 
He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back to the TV. A plan of attack is forming. 
HAL (obviously playing it up for the woman's benefit) Oh, there it is again. This is really getting embarrassing now. 
The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take. 
ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man who saved that woman   and her baby the other day! It is   you, isn't it? 
TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them, OVERHEARS.

{"train": "FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN \nFRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN \nWritten by Rob Hedden \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT \nA dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into view. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins. An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. \nWe continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nA teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing. Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders. \nJIM Well...how do you feel? \nSUZY Ask me in about five minutes. \nShe bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully.. \nJIM I'm talking about graduation. Being totally free to do whatever we want now. \nHer hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs. \nSUZY It feels excellent. \nHer mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently pulls away from her with a teasing smile. \nJIM Gotta throw the anchor over. \nHe leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets. \nEXT. HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT \nas Jim tosses a small anchor overboard. \nTIGHT ON WATER SURFACE \nas the weighty object splashes, sinking into black oblivion, pulling its cable down with it. \nJIM \nglances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He feels a chill, heading back inside. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK) \nas the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few feet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake silt. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nas Jim returns with an uneasy expression. He crawls on top of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same enthusiasm as before. \nSUZY What's wrong? \nJIM Nothing. \nHe starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses his anxiety. \nSUZY C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering you. \nJim pauses, turning off the mood music. \nJIM It's just that we're right around that old summer camp where all those murders took place. \nThe boat creaks. She's instantly nervous. \nSUZY What murders? \nJIM Never mind, you don't want to know about it. \nSUZY Tell me. \nJIM There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories. (beat) Let's drop it, okay? \nHe starts to kiss her again. She stops him. \nSUZY What stories? \nHe doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists. \nJIM There was this boy named Jason Voorhees who drowned in Crystal Lake... \nFLASHBACK \nEight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water. \nYOUNG JASON Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning... \nJIM (V.O.) None of the counselors heard him. \nYOUNG JASON Mmmmmmommy.... \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS \nas Suzy's eyes flash open. \nSUZY Did you hear that? \nJIM Hear what? \nHe pulls her back down. \nSUZY C'mon, I'm serious. \nHe knows the mood is broken. \nJIM All right, I'll check it out. \nHe slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the sheet up around her fearfully. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK) \nas the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely. JASON IS GONE. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS \nSuzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes. \nSUZY Jimmy...? \nNo answer. Her heart starts to pound. \nSUZY Jim...? \nAgain, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving towards the open door. The ship creaks again. \nSUZY'S POINT OF VIEW \nas she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch- black beyond it. \nSUZY Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean it... \n...And just as she reaches the door: \nA HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER \nleaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST. \nSUZY \nstands there in speechless shock, looking down at her mortal wound. But there's no blood. \nTHE MONSTER \npulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it aside. \nJIM Gotcha good, baby cakes. \nShe doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, laughing. \nEXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK \nsitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling it away. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS \nas Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying unsuccessfully to kiss her. \nJIM All right, all right -- I'm a major ass. \nSUZY And you'll never do it again. \nJIM And I'll never do it again. Forgive me? \nSUZY No. \nShe's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around him, finally giving in. \nEXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nA deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS \nThe sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now. \nANGLE - CABIN DOOR \nNothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME. \nSUZY \ncloses her eyes with pleasure... \nANGLE - CABIN DOOR \n...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES. \nRENNIE What about not-so-great writers? \nRennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen grinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far between, this one disappearing as she glances out the window. \nRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT) \nas the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread out before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes across it occupied by two indistinguishable people. \nRETURN TO SHOT \nRennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns away, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She turns a corner, heading into the parking lot. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Everything okay? \nRENNIE Just felt a little chill. \nRennie rubs her arms, faking coldness. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Did you know that I'm giving up teaching? \nRENNIE Really? \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody. \nRENNIE That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about? \nShe parks the car, turning off the ignition. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN A senior class cruise to Manhattan, laced with romance, adventure and murder. (beat) Or a Gothic cook book. I haven't decided which. \nShe's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again. Miss Van Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove compartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly surprised. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Go on, open it. \nRennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip pen. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school. \nRENNIE I don't know what to say... \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you. \nRennie hugs her teacher. Camera RISES above the car's window, finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short distance away. \nCLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES \nA sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA MASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of SENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and hellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda, EVA WATANABE. \n. TAMARA Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 'n roll or what, girl? \nEva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left. Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a smile at Tamara. \nMRS. WATANABE Hello, Tamara. \nTAMARA Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding. \nMRS. WATANABE Yes, I'm sure. \nEmbarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss goodbye. \nEVA Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll have a terrific time and I won't do anything stupid, okay? \nBefore Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate. \nMRS. WATANABE I love you... \nTRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA \nOnce they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot -- \nTAMARA I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties. \nEVA Really? \nTAMARA I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this. \nTamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous. \nTAMARA It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best. \nEVA He bought you that? \nTAMARA More or less. It's part of my college fund. \nShe grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT is aimlessly drifting into port. \nCLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT \nSure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a ghost ship. \nEXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY \nas Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another pair of seniors. \nMCCULLOCH You can stop right there, Miss Mason. \nAN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY \nfloundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to recognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the prologue. \nYOUNG JASON Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning... \nRENNIE \nleans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN What's wrong, Rennie?? \nRennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to speak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees: \nMISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW \nThe water is calm. No Young Jason. \nRETURN TO SHOT \nas Rennie gets a hold of herself. \nRENNIE I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine. \nShe continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned. \nRENNIE \ncontinues along the starboard side, not risking another glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes following her like a crazed raven. \nINT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY \nSharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the cruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF ENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA satellite computer as well as the LORAN. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON (checking watch) Let's take in the brow. \nCHIEF ENGINEER Yes Sir. (into intercom phone.) Take in the gangway and single up all lines. \nSEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge. \nSEAN Hello, Dad. \nMILES Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your ship. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've retired from the Navy ten years ago. \nMILES You've really been generous to give us this cruise. I know I speak for everybody on board. \nEverybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He avoids eye contact with his father. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON Hell, there's just twenty or so of you -- we only need a skeleton crew and it's a pleasure to sail her anyway. (beat) By the way, congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships, Miles. I'm sure you made your old man proud. \nAdmiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean should think about doing the same. \nCHIEF ENGINEER Have you decided on your departure protocol, Admiral? \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON Actually, I thought I'd leave the honors to my son. \nSEAN Dad, I don't think... \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON (to Chief Engineer, ignoring Sean) Relinquishing command of the Princess Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson. \nSean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his friend's nervousness as well. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON But before you take the helm, take this. \nHe tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting next to a rusty old sextant. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON Something old and something new. I used the sextant when I was your age, but now they have these goddamn computers to do all the work for you. \nCHIEF ENGINEER (to Sean) Have you decided on a plan of departure, Captain? \nSean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart. \nSEAN How about if we start up the forward engines and come around. 180 degrees... \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON Aren't you forgetting something? \nSean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It underscores his frustration. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON We're in foggy weather! Send out the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down, followed by a security broadcast warning other ships! \nHe shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this way. \nEXT. DECK - ON SEAN \nas he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at Sean. \nDECK HAND This voyage is doomed. \nSEAN Yeah, tell me about it. \nSean sidesteps him, moving on. \nEXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT) \nWAYNE I'll catch you later. \nHe exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling up her amp cord. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE \nas he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he passes a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS the footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition, our eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not for long. \nINT. POWER ROOM - DAY \nMassive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of pipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming generators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the surroundings. \nJ.J. This place is aching for a video. Wayne, you're an asshole. \nShe finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nWe're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, moving through it, behind the generators. \nJ.J. \npops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the \"play\" button. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nmoving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather pants as she bends over to plug in her axe. \nTIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR \nas J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female. receptacle. \nJASON'S FACE \nappears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes. J.J. \nscreams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with her playback. The generators are causing a breeze which makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending the high \"E\" string above the upper octave fret. She opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees: \nJASON \nemerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare. \nEXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME \nas J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, reacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it. \nINT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME \nas Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one last look at her before: \nJASON \nswings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull. \nEXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME \nas the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her guitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of Early Times. \nEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX) \nas LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is imminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting through whitecaps, no land in sight. \nCLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN \nas Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving to a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several beats. \nINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT \nNo inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her dog, who's curled up on the bed. \nRENNIE What do you think...time for some personal experiences to fuel our minds? \nThe dog's eyes blink, but no more than that. \nRENNIE I agree. \nRennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and some black satin pants. \nEXT. OUTSIDE DECK - SAME TIME \nWind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES JASON. \nTHROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX) \nas the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's window. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, slipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby and the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF RENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, facing us point-blank, and: \nREVERSE ANGLE \nNobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's something surreal about the window... \nTIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX) \nEmpty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM BELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake. \nRENNIE \nEva takes the straw. \nSTALKING POINT OF VIEW \nas we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows, hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead. Jason's coming... \nANGLE - TAMARA AND EVA \nas Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly. \nTAMARA Is that unbelievable or what? \nTamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line. But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with fear as: \nRENNIE \nappears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the cocaine, trying hard to ignore it. \nTAMARA Jesus, you scared the hell out of us. \nRENNIE Have you seen my dog? I think he came this way. \nTAMARA No, we haven't. (awkwardly) Care for a hit? \nRENNIE No thanks. \nRennie continues on. After she's gone... \nTAMARA A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us... \nEVA I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice. \nTAMARA Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice. \nTamara puts the straw to her nose. \nANGLE - RENNIE \nas she presses on, the corridor getting darker. \nRENNIE Toby? \nNo reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway... but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in half, providing a splintery sharp shaft. \nINT. SERVICE AREA - SAME TIME \nas Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a sniffle. \nTAMARA Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some. \nShe rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse. \nSTALKING POINT OF VIEW \nas we come down a corridor, turning into the Service Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva. They both GASP; Tamara drops her mirror, which SHATTERS on the ground. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nThey are facing McCulloch. \nMCCULLOCH What are you doing in here? \nTAMARA Nothing. \nHe eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday. \nMCCULLOCH Are you girls using drugs? \nEVA Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. McCulloch? We were just exploring the ship. \nHe doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her. \nMCCULLOCH I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents. \nTAMARA They're out of town. \nMCCULLOCH Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights. \nHe's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away. \nEVA What are you going to do? \nTAMARA Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter. (calculating) Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water... \nSPLASH! \nas a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at poolside, giving him some applause. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Poetry in motion, Miles. \nMILES A half-twist short. I'll hone that dive yet. \nHe swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie. She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room \nSean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around. Miss Van Deusen looks up at them. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN She's fine -- everybody go back to what you were doing. \nThey disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight to her teacher. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Care to talk about it? \nAfter a moment to compose herself... \nRENNIE I can't swim. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN I gathered that. \nRennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's holding out. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me. (beat) I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since. \nRENNIE It's not that simple. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you? \nRENNIE (long pause) Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him. \nThe teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful pause. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN When did this start? \nRENNIE About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN After your parents passed away? \nRennie nods somberly. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Did you have an accident in the lake? \nRENNIE No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees. \nThe name has triggered some deep memory...but the recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's voice. \nMCCULLOCH (O.S.) Dear God... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nas McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's soaked. He's livid. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN She's fine, Charles. Take it easy... \nMCCULLOCH Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen. \nRENNIE It wasn't her fault. \nHe gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean. \nMCCULLOCH Stay away from her...both of you. \nHe starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks their path, slipping his flask away. \nDECK HAND He's come back and you're all going to die. \nRennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch. \nRENNIE Just...leave me alone... \nShe pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off. \nINT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - NIGHT \nas a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes a sultry voice... \nTAMARA (O.S.) The door's open. \nMcCulloch swings it open. \nMCCULLOCH I'm in no mood for any more stall tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your final project? \nREVERSE ANGLE \nas Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe. \nTAMARA Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne first, Charles? \nHe's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer. \nMCCULLOCH Where did you get that alcohol? \nTAMARA I packed it. Just for us. \nEXT. DECK CORRIDOR - STALKING POINT OF VIEW \nas we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the people. \nINT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSEAN The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them \nShe starts to exit. \nSEAN I didn't mean for you to go! \nRENNIE Just radio for help, okay??? \nShe hurries out the door, working on terror-induced adrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing the keying button, speaking into the mike. \nSEAN Mayday, mayday, mayday... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nas JULIUS arrives with the others from the locker room. They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the radio. \nSEAN Please...can anybody out there hear me?? \nNo response. WAYNE and MILES rush in. \nMILES Sean, what's going on? \nThen he sees the corpses. He needs no further answer. \nWAYNE Jesus Christ... \nHe's too scared to even videotape it. Sean is bombarded with questions as he tries to figure out the radio. \nJULIUS Who did this, man? \nWAYNE Is the radio even working?? \nMILES Isn't there some international S.O.S. thing you can do??? \nSEAN (suddenly remembers) Channel 16...the distress frequency... (dialing knob) Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the Princess Ruby. Please, somebody answer... \nEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (STOCK) \nas a COAST GUARD CUTTER tracks through stormy seas. \nRADIO OFFICER (V.O.) This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas. What is the nature of your problem, Ruby? \nINT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN AND OTHERS \nas they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled. \nSEAN The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead. \nRADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.) (a grave-pause) What is your location? \nSEAN I...I don't know... \nRADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.) Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN? \nSEAN Yes... \nRADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.) The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can. \nSean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers. \nEXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA - SAME TIME (EFX) \nas LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera slowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second later, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP. \nINT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME \nas Sean hurries back to the radio, pressing it against his spitless mouth. \nSEAN I've got the numbers. \nRADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.) Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec... \nSuddenly his voice is CUT OFF, followed by STATIC. \nSEAN Hello? Are you there?? \nNo response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat. \nEXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA \nas Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching onward. \nEXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \nas McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van Deusen. \nMCCULLOCH I demand to know what is going on... \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Oh dear God... \nShe's seen the bodies. McCulloch follows her glance, paling. He quickly takes charge, pushing through the students. \nMCCULLOCH Where's the radio? \nSEAN It's...dead. \ndeciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling it open. \nEXT. BOW - ON RENNIE \nmoving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK. \nRENNIE Toby? \nShe turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after Toby. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nthrough the crack in the door, watching Rennie unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when ha hears: \nEVA (O.S.) Tamara? Are you around here anywhere? \nJason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH EVA \nas she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every alcove. \nEVA Tamara? \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nmoving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva before she turns a corner and disappears. \nINT. HALLWAY/TAMARA'S STATEROOM - MOVING WITH EVA (STEADICAM) \nEva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom. She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings open, unlocked. \nEVA Tamara? (no response) I just want to talk with you. \nShe steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND causes her to look back at: \nTHE BATHROOM DOOR \nIt slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with grotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE DOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR SRARDS. \nEVA \nshrieks, running back out the door... \nINT. STATEROOM HALLWAY \n...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat. \nRUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD) \nGasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral staircase and running on. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM) \nchasing after her with the smooth determination of a shark, never letting her get too far in the lead. \nINT. BOWELS OF SHIP - ON EVA \nEmpty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races past a sign directing passengers to \"CLUB RUBY.\" \nANGLE - JASON \n--entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in the direction of the disco. He tramples onward. \nINT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM) \nThe thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward, curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars lighting system assaults her all directions along with the music. She's all alone in here. \nTIGHT ON EVA \nThe lights strobing across her face only accentuate her terror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing to it. It's locked. \nCROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR \nas Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT BEHIND HIM. \nEVA \ndecides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the corridor again and: \nJASON \nappears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's gone. \nEVA \nbacks away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the point where she last saw him. But: \nJASON \nilluminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course with him. \nEVA \nwhirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, PUSHING IN on her face. \nJULIUS (flexes fists) Nothin'. \nWAYNE (dead serious) We're talking the possibility of Jason Voorhees here. \nJulius pauses. He's not stupid. \nJULIUS Nothin' but this gun. \nHe reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they move. \nINT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nas McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging her door open. \nRENNIE Can't we at least talk about it? \nMCCULLOCH I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship. \nRENNIE But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing? \nHe avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room now; he's in the hallway. \nMCCULLOCH Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees. (pause) I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about. \nRENNIE I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles. \nMCCULLOCH This isn't a request. \nHe closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other side. \nRENNIE (O.S.) Uncle Charles! \nHe ignores her, briskly walking away. \nINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME \nas she throws her fists against the door a final time, realizing it's futile. \nINT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT \nSteam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing pipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his video camera to guide him. \nWAYNE J.J. -- you down here? \nCLOSER ANGLE \nas Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares the crap out of him, causing him to stumble. \nINSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT) \n--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where. \nWAYNE \nlies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself to a standing position again. \nWAYNE We got a major problem, Wayne. \nWAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW \nHis vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than crisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily forward. \nPOINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK \nas Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A PROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat. \nWAYNE \ntakes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs leading down to the next level. And when he arrives there... \nWAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW \n...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A KNIFE. \nWAYNE \ninstantly raises the rifle and FIRES... \nWAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW \n...and the body goes down. He's hit him! \nWAYNE \nstands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to adjust the eyepiece diaptor. \nWAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE) \nas the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, finally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, not a knife. \nWAYNE \nslowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his throat. \nWAYNE No... \nas the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep pause for thought. \nINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME \nas the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he hurries off. \nINT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \nas McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast. \nMCCULLOCH Can you shut that damn thing off?? \nSean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN We already thought of that -- nobody could possibly see it in this storm... \nMCCULIACH There's only one person who needs to see it. And I'm going to find him. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN What about the fire?? \nMCCULLOCH I doubt very much that one even exists. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN What are you talking about? \nMCCULLOCH Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board. (resolved) Enough is enough. \nHe marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van Deusen. \nSEAN We have to get everybody together just in case the fire's for real. \nSean heads for the door, shoving it forward. \nEXT. DECK - ON DOOR \nas it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised. \nJULIUS' POINT OF VIEW \nwalking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE. \nJULIUS \nshoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly lowers the rifle. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nas MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out of each other. \nMILES I'll take the upper deck. \nJulius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent... \nINT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX) \nFilled with black smoke. The fire is spreading dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads: DANGER - FUEL TANKS. \nEXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT \n--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level. \nPOINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER \nSomeone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every step. \nEXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS \nas Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nOnly darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S HEAD... \n...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes contact, flinging it away. \nEXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS \nHe's pacing along when a clattering noise from above makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, jerking his head upward. \nJULIUS Miles?? \nHis answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same time: \nRUNNING WITH MILES \nHe's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nHe's having no problem catching up to the defenseless teenager. \nEXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME \nas Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade. \nEXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT \nTHE DOOR \nis SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in terror but it's SEAN who is standing there. \nSEAN Rennie...?? \nRENNIE (pointing) The window... \nSean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, seeing nothing. He steps back to her. \nRENNIE I don't understand what is happening to me... \nShe breaks down; he holds her. \nSEAN It's gonna be okay... \nINT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX) \n...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning down into the tank. A second later the whole thing EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FIRE. \nEXT. SHIP HULL - UNDERWATER (EFX/MODEL?) \nas a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull: \nINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME \nThe ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie clings to him fearfully. \nRENNIE What is it?? \nOne second later, the lights begin to flicker. \nSEAN The power room... \nINT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX) \nas huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in the hull. \nINT. SHIP KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nas the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun, moving onward. \nPONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS \nSomeone is crouched behind a massive convection oven, spying on McCulloch. \nMCCULLOCH \nalmost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense. \nINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME \nSean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, trying to think, talking to himself. \nSEAN Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly... \nRENNIE Is the ship going to sink?? \nHe returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in. \nSEAN I don't know. \nHer ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on. \nSEAN The emergency lights just kicked in... \nSean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant to convince himself as much as Rennie. \nSEAN We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case. \nRENNIE (terrified) I'm not going near any lifeboat! \nSEAN But Rennie... \nRENNIE I'm not!! \nINT. SHIP RESTAURANT ROOM - SAME TIME \nas Miss Van Deusen gathers a handful of students who are panicking, sitting them down. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Everybody wait right here until I come back with the others -- understand? \nThey nod, frightened to death. She dashes away, carrying us into a view of the dining room windows. No one notices the SILHOUETTE OF JASON passing by on the outside desk. \nINT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX) \nSea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine bearings begin to GRIND. \nINT. SHIP HALLWAY - SAME TIME \nas McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door, cautiously entering with flare gun raised. \nMCCULLOCH Rennie?? \nMCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW \nturns to see JASON APPROACHING THEM WITH AXE RAISED. She backs away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for the hoist. He arches back with his weapon and SLICES DOWNWARD. \nINSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT) \nas Jason's axe CHOPS THE CABLE IN TWO, and: \nEXT. SHIP/OCEAN (TANK) \nThe bow cable SNAPS, DUMPING THE HALF DOZEN TEENAGERS INTO THE TURBULENT SALT WATER. They last about five seconds before succumbing to a drowning death. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN \nsees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing knots. She summons all her rationale and sends it down to her legs, running away as fast as she can. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW \n--knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as she flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop as it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her. Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon the sight of Miss Van Deusen. \nANGLE TO INCLUDE ALL \nas Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms. The teacher holds her, beginning to cry herself. \nMCCULLOCH Why aren't you with the others, woman?? \nFinally the message comes forth: \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Jason...he has an axe... \nHis face grows taut with anger. \nMCCULLOCH Jason Voorhees is dead!! \nA PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING THE KITCHEN KNIFE. \nMCCULLOCH \nraises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT... \nANGLE - DECK HAND (EFX) \n...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands there with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle in effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward, and: \nCLOSE ON HIS BACK (EFX) \nThey all see that JASON'S AXE HAS BEEN BURIED IN HIS BACK. \nRETURN TO MASTER \nMcCulloch gazes with utter disbelief. \nMCCULLOCH Dear Christ... \nSEAN We have to get off this ship!! \nThey back away from the horrid sight and begin to run, the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears. \nEXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT \nas McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble to the closest lifeboat. \nSEAN Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists \nMcCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the lifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing classy-eyed at the small boat. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Come on, sweetheart -- get in... \nBut she doesn't budge. McCulloch levels wild eyes on her, quickly climbing back down. \nMCCULLOCH Get in the boat, Rennie! \nRENNIE I...I can't... \nMCCULLOCH (shaking her) You can and you will!! \nHe tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy. \nSEAN Stop it!! \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Leave her alone, Charles! \nMiss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and holds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently. \nEXT. DECK - TIGHT ON DEAD DECK HAND - SAME TIME \nas rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S FOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN, RETRIEVING HIS AXE FROM THE DECK HAND'S SPINE. \nEXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - SAME TIME \nas Rennie clings to\t Miss Van Deusen, crying. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get in the boat now, okay? Please...for me? \nRennie finds herself nodding. Miss Van Deusen helps the trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right behind. \nINT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUOUS \nThe water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog. Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar; McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van Deusen. \nMCCULLOCH (miserable) If we don't find the shore soon we're all going to die. \nSean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN (unable to hide fear) Do you know where we are, Sean? \nSean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment, remembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He stares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him, seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his shoulder. \nJULIUS Hey man, if I can make it, so can. you. \nSean slowly nods, turning on the calculator. \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (TANK) \nas the lifeboat rows into frame, the water relatively calm. \nINT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (TANK) \nMcCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean and Julius rowing on sheer will power. Sean takes one more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his coherence again. Julius glances off the side of the ship for no particular reason, then does a doubletake. \nJULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.) \nThey are rowing right past THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, illuminated in all its glory. \nINT. LIFEBOAT (TANK) \nJulius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking control of his haggard face. He tugs on Sean's sleeve, his eyes never leaving the monument. \nJULIUS Hey man, wake up! Check it out!! \nThe other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here. \nJULIUS God damn, we're in New York! You did it, my man!! \nJulius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks. \nWIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.) \nas the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear the faint sound of Julius singing \"New York, New York,\" relieved to be alive. They're going to make it. \nEXT. EMPTY OCEAN - ANOTHER ANGLE (TANK) \nas the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water begins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK BREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN. And swimming onward. \nEXT. CANNERY HARBOR - NIGHT \nas Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge beneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the safest part of town by a longshot. \nCLOSER ANGLE \nas they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back at it and sees: \nYOUNG RENNIE \nflailing her arms in the water right next to the lifeboat, drowning. \nYOUNG RENNIE Hhhhelp...me.... \nSuddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW, GRABBING HER, DRAGGING HER UNDER. \nEXT. BARGE - ON RENNIE \nShe gazes in utter shock, screaming: \nRENNIE No!!! \nThey all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm, nothing there. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN (holding her) It's okay...you're safe now... \nMcCulloch grits his teeth. \nMCCULLOCH Come on -- everybody up the ladder. \nHe's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing the ladder. \nCLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT \nas the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of the dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the lifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE WATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new surroundings, quite different from all the years he's spent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the dock causes him the longest pause... \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nA tattered billboard over one of the warehouses advertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a full shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE. \nJASON \nlooks at it long and hard. He tears off his life preserver wits renewed ambition. \nWIDE SHOT - BARGE AND DOCK WAREHOUSES - NIGHT \nas Jason heads up the ladder. He's about to take Manhattan. \nas a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle. WIDEN to find Gang Banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes, his compadre holding a squirming Rennie down on the couch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm. \nRENNIE Please don't... \nGANG BANGER #1 Loosen up, baby. It'll feel way better if you're stoned. \nCLOSE ON JASON'S FEET - SAME TIME \nAmongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded syringe. Jason picks it up. \nCLOSER ANGLE - COUCH \njust as Gang Banger #2 jabs Rennie with the needle. Gang Banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket, pushing Rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his friend watches excitedly. \nGANG BANGER #1 Slang us some more 'caine, JoJo. We're in for a long night. \nGang Banger #2 runs out the back way. #1 tears open Rennie's blouse, his filthy mouth moving to her neck. Rennie spits in his face. He hesitates not in SLAPPING HER HARD. \nGANG BANGER #1 It's your parade, princess. Can be smooth or can be rough. Your choice. \nShe closes .her eyes, trying to blot out what's about to happen. \nGANG BANGER #1 I think I'm in love. \nPUSH IN on his face as his neck arches down, bringing his lips toward her chest. Just before contact he GRUNTS THICKLY, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT. \nWIDER ANGLE \nJason is standing right behind him, shoving something into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again, bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. Jason goes for number three and: \nCLOSE UP - GANG BANGER #1'S CHEST (EFX) \nJason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the needle sticking out his front side. \nRENNIE \nopens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At the same time: \nGANG BANGER #2 \ncomes around the corner. \nGANG BANGER #2 Forgot my money, holmes... \nHa stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason. \nGANG BANGER #2 Who the fuck are you? \nJason paces toward him. The kid glances at his dead friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his \nGANG BANGER #2 You're dead, fuckhead. \nBANG! \n...but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball and SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The kid falls in a bloody heap. \nRENNIE \nshoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily disorienting him. Rennie sprints away. \nEXT. ALLEY #1 - NIGHT (LONG LENS) \nas Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley, spotting a phone booth. He hurries for it. \nPREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW \nLike a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the booth. \nJULIUS \nslams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, punching the \"operator\" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as he waits for an answer. Several more rings. \nJULIUS C'mon... \nFinally a click and muffled words from the operator. \nJULIUS Get me the police -- this is an emergency... \nSMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW, GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running out the door. The phone is left dangling. \nRUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD) \nwith no apparent direction. Literally running for his life. \nTRACKING WITH JASON \nHe's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical. \nJULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD) \nheading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting his course straight for it. \nANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE \nas Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as fast as is humanly possible. \nShe's instantly tense. \nMCCULLOCH He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake. \nYOUNG RENNIE He is not. \nMCCULLOCH Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim. \nYOUNG RENNIE You're telling a lie. \nMCCULLOCH Am I? Let's find out. \n...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH PUSHES HER OVERBOARD. \nSPLASH! \nas Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface. She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly leans over the edge. \nMCCULLOCH Better swim before Jason drags you down, Rennie. Come on, you can do it... \n...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep from sinking under the surface. \nRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW \nHer uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her eyes. \nYOUNG RENNIE I...I can't... \nMCCULLOCH You can and you will! Swim, Rennie! \nRENNIE \nis too panicked to obey. \nYOUNG RENNIE Hhhhelp...me.... \nShe coughs on some water then disappears... \nUNDERWATER (TANK) \nThe world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror... \nRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK) \nYoung Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we: \nDISSOLVE BACK TO: \nEXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT \nas the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone. ADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before: \nANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX) \nThe auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING EVERYWHERE. \nEXT. ALLEY #4 - CONTINUOUS \nShe looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that tell him she's remembered everything. \nRENNIE You pushed me... \nMCCULLOCH (defensively) I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life. \nRennie just stares, incredulous. \nSEAN You son of a bitch... \nShe lets it build until she's ready to explode...then: \nRENNIE He was down there!!! \nAnd Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean grabs him, shoving him down. \nSEAN You keep away from her! \nSean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white. \nMCCULLOCH You...are...NOT POSSIBLE. \nBut possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS EXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME. \nTRACKING WITH JASON \nas the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason releases him, moving on. \nEXT. ALLEY #5 - NIGHT \nas Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie, crouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only hate. Sean sits down next to her. After several moments... \nRENNIE I was at school when they told me. 'Rennie, we have some very bad news... your parents have been killed in an auto accident.' \nSean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony. \nRENNIE It seems like everybody I care about ends up... \nSANITATION ENGINEER Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods out with the stuff on the 13th of every month, right at midnight. (checks watch) And that's less than ten minutes from now. \nRennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, swallowing hard. \nSANITATION ENGINEER Follow me. \nHe clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly leads them down: \nINT. TUNNEL #2 \n...no less threatening than the one they just left. When they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS HIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND SEAN. \nTHE FLASHLIGHT \nrolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically across the polluted walls. \nTHE SANITATION ENGINEER \nbegins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the monster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL \nRENNIE \ntries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the opposite wall, barely conscious. \nSEAN Run, Rennie... \nShe's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel #3, seeing: \nA GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL \nJason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull. \nRENNIE \nbacks away but does not run. The time has come to face her fears. \nANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL \nas Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him off. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated tool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for Sean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench over Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning directly into it. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nRennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in the reflective wet surroundings. \nRENNIE You never got me in the lake, Jason. And you're not going to get me now either. \nHer voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the irritating light never leaving us. \nJASON \nhas been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nas the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down the intersecting tunnel (#1). \nTIGHT ON JASON'S FEET \nstomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's wanted to kill Rennie most of all. \nINT. TUNNEL #L \nas Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to crush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but still resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder. \nINT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON \nHe's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling after his fix. \nINSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM \nas the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately causing it to cave in. \nINT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW \n--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into Tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie flinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second later a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US... \nTIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION) \nand his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, SEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank buckshot. \nRENNIE \ndrops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again. \nCLOSE UP - JASON (EFX) \nas the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the plastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT CLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the chemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his eyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just broke, running down his face. \nCLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT \nas the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE TO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning sight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and RUNS. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nas Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie. \n", "test1_input": "Jason raises the shard above her and just as she SHRIEKS... \nCLOSE UP - STEAM WHISTLE OF SHIP \nas it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night. It begins to rain. \nEXT. LADIES RESTROOM - NIGHT \nas Rennie comes rushing out, right into the arms of. Sean. She clings to him, sobbing as the rain falls over them. \nSEAN It's okay...you're going to be okay. \nRENNIE I want to go home. I want off this ship. \nAfter a moment... \nSEAN Me too. (beat) Let's go talk to my Dad. \nHe puts his arm around her, leading her toward the bridge. \nINT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \nas wind and rain pummel the bridge window.. Admiral Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr. Carlson, and get the seas off the quarter. These kids are in for one hell of a storm. \nCHIEF ENGINEER Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise mode. \nThe Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches, flipping a row of them. \nTIGHT ON NAVIGATIONAL CHART WALL - SAME TIME \nas a bloodstained HAND silently removes the rusty harpoon hanging above the map. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON \ngets a reflective look in his weary eyes. \nADMIRAL-ROBERTSON How olds your boy now, Carlson? \nCHIEF ENGINEER Nineteen months. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON A tremendous age. Take some advice from a salty old man: don't push him too hard. \nThe Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE. \nCHIEF ENGINEER This is the bridge. Approaching weather suggests we secure the main deck and... \nHis sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from excruciating, instant pain. His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he stares into the face of: \nJASON \nholding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it forward with one more staccato jerk and: \nCLOSE UP - CHIEF ENGINEER'S BACK \n-- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through his once-white uniform. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON \nreturns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside. \nADMIRAL ROBERTSON Better have them doublecheck the lifeboat stations as well... \nAdmiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr. Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson bends his neck upwards to face: \nJASON \nhovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling knives. \nINT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nas Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the bridge. \nRENNIE Can he really take us home? \nSEAN Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you. \nRENNIE What about you? \nSEAN If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again. (beat) But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do. \nHe's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they walk on. \nTHEIR POINT OF VIEW \nmoving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not the slightest inclination of what's in store for them. \nSEAN \nknocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean puts his weight into it, shoving hard. \nINT. BRIDGE \nas the door slides open, Sean stepping inside. His eyes roil downwards upon seeing THE DEAD CHIEF ENGINEER, THE HARPOON PROTRUDING FROM HIS BLOODY CHEST. \n", "test1_true": "Sean looks over at the helm...where his father is still sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent. Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock. \nSEAN'S POINT OF VIEW \nSlowly walking toward Admiral Robertson...at least he thinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his face. Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's about two feet away from him... \nSEAN \nreaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his father BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We MOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching onto him tightly. \nSEAN He's...he's dead... \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME \nas Miss Van Deusen steps up to Rennie's door, gently knocking. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Ronnie? I just came by to see how you were feeling... \nNo answer. She knocks harder...and it creaks open, unlocked. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Rennie...? \nSuddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung open. MCCULLOCH is standing on the other side of it. \nMCCULLOCH I thought I told you to stay away from her. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN (holds her ground) Where is she? \nMCCULLOCB (accusing) That's a very good question and I'd appreciate an answer. \nA LOUD BUZZER blares out of an intercom speaker next to their heads, causing the teachers to both jump. Sean's unsteady voice immediately follows. \nSEAN (V.O.) Attention everybody, attention. This is Sean Robertson... \nEXT. SWIMMING POOL - SAME TIME \nMiles is toweling off under the shelter of a gazebo as Sean's voice blares out of a rain-pounded megaphone speaker nearby. \nSEAN (V.O.) There's been... (swallows) What I mean is, this is an emergency... \nMiles knows he can't be joking around. Wayne comes walking by, covering his camcorder with his jacket. \nWAYNE Miles -- have you seen J.J.? She was supposed to be jamming down in the power room but... \nMiles gestures for him to be quiet, listening very worriedly. \nSEAN (V.O.) Repeat, this is an emergency... \nINT. GYM LOCKERS - SAME TIME \nas JULIUS and two other senior boys finish dressing after a shower, hearing Sean's words reverberate around them. \nSEAN (V.O.) I want everybody to meet on the bridge... \nJULIUS What the fuck is this? \nThe others shrug, concerned. \nEXT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - SAME TIME \nThe wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in precipitation. Eva stands alone in the rain, staring at the court as Sean's voice continues. \nSEAN (V.O.) Stay calm, but get here as quick as possible. Walk with a friend if you can... \nEva wipes the rain from her face, then walks away. \nINT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN \ntrying his best to keep it together. He glances at his dead father, still unable to believe it. \nSEAN (V.O.) God, I wish this was a joke, but it's not. \nSean slowly puts down the phone. He's lost in a daze. Suddenly the SHIP LURCHES, a huge swell SPLASHING THE BRIDGE WINDOW. Admiral Robertson's body falls from the swivel chair. \nRENNIE What is happening??? \nSean regains his balance, moving to the computer console, looking at the OMEGA and LORAN like he's never seen them before. \nSEAN I don't know...we've gone off course or something... \nRENNIE What do you mean??? \nAnother wave hammers the bow. She's in a state of awful panic. \nSEAN I don't know what I mean! All's I know is that there's no one guiding this ship anymore... \nSean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking him. \nRENNIE Can't you call for help?? \nSean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing frenetically. \nSEAN I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further... \nRENNIE Where are they? \n", "test2_input": "MCCULLOCH (stewing) Yes. \nIRISH COP Who is...Jason? \nMCCULLOCH He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from hell. \nThe others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen turns to the confused policeman. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN I'm afraid you'll have some trouble believing us. \nIRISH COP So try me. \nEXT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT \nparked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. The Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming towards it. \nIRISH COP You're right -- I find it a tall tale indeed. But you seem like honest folks so I'm inclined to believe at least some of it. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN (relieved) Thank you. The first thing we' have to do is find Julius. \nIRISH COP I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why don't you climb in the back while I radio for backup. \nADJUST INTO A FULL SHOT OF THE BACK DOOR AS HE SWINGS IT OPEN...but even in this darkness, we see that it's empty. They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door, and... \nINSERT - DOME LIGHT (SECOND UNIT) \nThe car dome light blinks on, and... \nANGLE - BACK SEAT \nOur four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated, INSTANTLY CHANGING TO GASPS AND SCREAMS because: \nTHEIR POINT OF VIEW (EFX) \nJulius' severed head is resting on the dash board, staring back at them!!! \nANGLE - COP \nreacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly grabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message because JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW, GRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is still in his grasp. \nINSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT) \nas the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. The Irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a sick THUD. \nINT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police cars have no door handles in the back. \nSEAN There aren't any handles!! \nCocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just as: \nJASON \nappears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE CAR. \nINT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS \nThere is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition and fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON THE ACCELERATOR. Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto the floorboards. \nRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX) \nHer vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set her target. We come straight at the abominable creature and: \nWHAM! (EFX) \nJason is mowed down. \nRENNIE \nslams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT AGAIN. \nCLOSE ON JASON (EFX) \nas the automobile grinds back over him a second time. \nRENNIE \nstomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath, looking out the front window... \nTHEIR POINT OF VIEW \nJason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He SLOWLY STANDS. \nRENNIE \ndesperately throws it into forward again, gripping the wheel and RACING FORWARD. \nPOINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE) \nJason's standing there for one second, but the next moment he is LEAPING OUT OF THE WAY... \nEXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT (STUNT DRIVE) \n...and the squad car SMASHES THROUGH A CHAIN LINK FENCE, FREEFALLING TO THE ABANDONED PARKING LOT BELOW. \n", "test2_true": "as the car bottoms out, then swerves into a sharp right turn, racing down the alley. \nPOINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE) \nas Jason appears at the end of the alley, blocking their retreat. \nINT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS \nas Rennie stomps the brake pedal, jerking it into reverse... \nEXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE) \nas she backs up, changes gears and races down an intersecting alley. \nPOINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE) \nspeeding towards an escape when JASON POPS OUT AGAIN! He's everywhere all at once... \nINT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS \nslamming on the discs one more time, flooring it into reverse. \nCLOSE ON TIRES - CONTINUOUS (SECOND UNIT) \nas the squad car's rear tires smoke and spin, finally gripping pavement. \nPOINT OF VIEW OUT REAR WINDOW (STUNT DRIVE) \nas we fly backwards...and JASON APPEARS BEHIND THEM!! \nTIGHT ON REAR VIEW MIRROR \n--Rennie's terrified face filling it, seeing that Jason is in back of them. \nTIGHT ON REAR TIRES (SECOND UNIT) \nas they screech to a halt one final time, rapidly rotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of frame. \nINT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS \nRennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around the vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the floorboard. \nMCCULLOCH Rennie, for God's sake slow down!! \nShe doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking. \nRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX) \nThere's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks too small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO SLOW MOTION JUST BEFORE IMPACT. The figure is a dripping wet boy with a sinister smile. YOUNG JASON. \nEXT. BRICK WALL - A SPLIT SECOND LATER (EFX) \nas the front of the squad car RAMS THE BRICK WALL HEAD- ON, THE HOOD BURSTING INTO FLAMES. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nas the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who drags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater. Then it suddenly hits Sean... \nSEAN Miss Van Deusen... \nHe takes two steps back to the car when: \nBOOM! (EFX) \nThe squad car interior is ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FLAMES. \nRENNIE \nopens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body charring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt... \nEXT. ASPHALT - RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX) \nA pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across its glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN, not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The rowboat glides across the surface of the burning gasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt SLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE. \nRENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY \nShimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it. The rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG RENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an innocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the water. She stands, letting the sun soak into her. \nYOUNG RENNIE What a beautiful day. \nMCCULLOCH Perfect for a swim, isn't it? \nShe frowns at him, looking away. \nMCCULLOCH You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how. \nYOUNG RENNIE I'll take some lessons this time. I promise. \nShe bends over, splashing the water. \nMCCULLOCH That's what you said last year. I think the time for your first swimming lesson has just come. \nThe splashing stops. \nMCCULLOCH You don't want to end up drowning like that Voorhees boy, do you? \n", "test3_input": "INSERT - TRAIN CONSOLE \nas the Engineer's arm KNOCKS THE THROTTLE FORWARD... \nEXT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.) \n...and the train begins to move, racing into the black tunnel. \nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT (N.Y.) \nas Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and entering the next car. Jason follows right behind. \nINT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.) \nas the train thunders through the station without stopping, baffling several waiting COMMUTERS. \nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (N.Y.) \n--seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another connecting door. We storm our way through it into the next car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower away from us. \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.) \nas the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of slowing down. \nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - FINAL CAR (N.Y.) \nas Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR IT. \nEXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.) \n...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT. \nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.) \nThe sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the rear door open, jumping out with Rennie. \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.) \nas Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks toward the light of the next station, running out of strength. \nINT. TIMES SQUARE STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.) \nas they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the pit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself when: \nJASON \nfires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as Rennie watches helplessly. \nRENNIE NO!!! \nRENNIE \nruns straight towards the track pit like a football punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON SQUARELY IN THE FACE. \nJASON (EFX) \ntrips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and convulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be terminated!!! \nANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE \nas they get to their feet, holding each other tight, looking down on the now-dead undead creature. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.) (CRANE SHOT) \nas our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the awesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his arm around her. \nSEAN It's over, Rennie. It's finally over. \nCamera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. Guess who has just made an encore...with more energy than ever!!! \nSEAN AND RENNIE \nlook all around them, having never been to a city as big as this. They finally turn far enough around to spot JASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer than the last. \nSEAN God...please no... \nBut Jason keeps on coming. \nRENNIE Somebody help us!! He's going to kill us!!! \nBut the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to flee again. \nJASON \nshoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull out switchblades and chains. \nSTREET URCHIN You're dead meat, slime bag. \nJason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, facing them squarely. \nTIGHT ON STREET URCHINS \nas Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces turn to putty, scared completely shitless. \nSTREET URCHIN Hey man, it's cool, it's cool... \n", "test3_true": "INT. TIMES SQUARE DINER - NIGHT \nfilled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough, redheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The front door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and Rennie, rushing up to the waitress. \nSEAN (out of breath) You have to call the police... \nRENNIE Please, hurry... \nA telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York. \nWAITRESS There's a pay phone in back. \nThey start to run. \nWAITRESS ...but it's broken. \nRENNIE You don't understand -- there's a maniac trying to kill us!!! \nWAITRESS (blase) Welcome to New York. \nThere's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES THROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS THEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress eyes Jason with complete disbelief. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nas the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX. \nTHE WAITRESS \npicks up the telephone, really pissed off. \nA BIKER \nclimbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS JASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it out, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing away. \nTHE WAITRESS \nstops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now. \nJASON \nlifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO THE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER. \nTHE WAITRESS \nfeels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her mouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as she can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons shrink from him. \nINT. REAR OF DINER - SAME TIME \nas Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains, finally getting the back door open and springing into: \nEXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT \nThey run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a dead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other way when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision scatters everywhere in search of a retreat... \nRENNIE Look! \nShe's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the cover back as Jason comes forth. \nINT. SEWER - ENTRANCE CHAMBER - NIGHT \nas they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of stagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and Rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing deeper into the labyrinth. \nANGLE UP STAIRS \nas the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is eclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them. \nINT. TUNNEL #1 - NIGHT \nAn oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness. Dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery rust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end, wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us. \nTRACKING SHOT \nas they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, strangers in a very strange land. \nANGLE - THEIR FEET \nsloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's foot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT. A vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of the container, sizzling on the around. \nSEAN AND RENNIE \ncarefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it another ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE, GRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through the tunnel. \nREVERSE ANGLE \n...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers the wrench, as frightened as they are. \nSANITATION ENGINEER What the hell are you kids doing down here? \nSEAN Can you help us get out?? \nSANITATION ENGINEER I sure can and we don't have a minute to waste. \nHe begins quickly packing up his tools. \nSEAN What do you mean? \n"}

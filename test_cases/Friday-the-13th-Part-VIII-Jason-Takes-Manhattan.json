CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT \nA dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into view. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins. An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. \nWe continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nA teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing. Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders. \nJIM Well...how do you feel? \nSUZY Ask me in about five minutes. \nShe bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully.. \nJIM I'm talking about graduation. Being totally free to do whatever we want now. \nHer hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs. \nSUZY It feels excellent. \nHer mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently pulls away from her with a teasing smile. \nJIM Gotta throw the anchor over. \nHe leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets. \nEXT. HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT \nas Jim tosses a small anchor overboard. \nTIGHT ON WATER SURFACE \nas the weighty object splashes, sinking into black oblivion, pulling its cable down with it. \nJIM \nglances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He feels a chill, heading back inside. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK) \nas the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few feet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake silt. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nas Jim returns with an uneasy expression. He crawls on top of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same enthusiasm as before. \nSUZY What's wrong? \nJIM Nothing. \nHe starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses his anxiety. \nSUZY C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering you. \nJim pauses, turning off the mood music. \nJIM It's just that we're right around that old summer camp where all those murders took place. \nThe boat creaks. She's instantly nervous. \nSUZY What murders? \nJIM Never mind, you don't want to know about it. \nSUZY Tell me. \nJIM There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories. (beat) Let's drop it, okay? \nHe starts to kiss her again. She stops him. \nSUZY What stories? \nHe doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists. \nJIM There was this boy named Jason Voorhees who drowned in Crystal Lake... \nFLASHBACK \nEight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water. \nYOUNG JASON Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning... \nJIM (V.O.) None of the counselors heard him. \nYOUNG JASON Mmmmmmommy.... \n", "test1_true": "INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS \nJIM A bunch of years went by and everybody forgot about it. (beat) That's when the murders started. \nFLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK) \nas our senses are bombarded with QUICK CUTS of assorted \nteenagers just about to die, their screams echoing over each other. We do not see the attacker. As the cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo, CUT BACK TO: \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nas the silence hits us hard again. \nSUZY Jason did it...? \nJIM' That's what some people thought. But they were wrong. \nFLASHBACK (STOCK) \nas MRS. VOORHEES comes directly at camera wielding a huge knife and a primal scream. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nJIM His mother blamed the counselors for his death and tried to kill them all. (dramatic pause) She got her head chopped off by one of them. \nWe don't need to see this clip...Suzy's reaction is quite sufficient. \nSUZY So the murders stopped? \nHe gives her a long, penetrating look. \nJIM No. \nFLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK) \nWe're bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked JASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers...brandishing everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws. Just as Jason is about to stab us, CUT BACK TO: \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nSuzy flinches as if she were getting the knife. \nJIM Legend has it that Jason came back to avenge his mother's death, vowing to kill every teenager from the area. (beat) And every now and then, the murders start up again. \nThe boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable. She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too. \nJIM Forget about it, Suzy. They're just stories. \nHe brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, finding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes, trying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't. Suzy begins to rationalize. \nSUZY We're the last graduating class, right? \nJim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him. \nJIM Right. \nSUZY I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right? \nJIM Right. \nSUZY So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right? \nJim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes. \nJIM Right. Except that Jason isn't real so none of it matters anyway. \nShe starts to relax, returning his kisses. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK) \nas the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard on the power cable. Camera TRACKS along the cable, coming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS \nas Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are starting to slip away along with their clothes. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK) \nas the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the tugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we find to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body of JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's face is obscured.) \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS \nTeenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At the same moment: \nEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK) \nThe anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE. SPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding the chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN ELECTRICITY. \nEXT. HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX) \nas BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface. ARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable, sparking across the hoist. \nEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WIDE SHOT FROM WATER \nas the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly extinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness. \n", "test1_id": 2874, "test2_input": "THE DOOR \nis SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in terror but it's SEAN who is standing there. \nSEAN Rennie...?? \nRENNIE (pointing) The window... \nSean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, seeing nothing. He steps back to her. \nRENNIE I don't understand what is happening to me... \nShe breaks down; he holds her. \nSEAN It's gonna be okay... \nINT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX) \n...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning down into the tank. A second later the whole thing EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FIRE. \nEXT. SHIP HULL - UNDERWATER (EFX/MODEL?) \nas a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull: \nINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME \nThe ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie clings to him fearfully. \nRENNIE What is it?? \nOne second later, the lights begin to flicker. \nSEAN The power room... \nINT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX) \nas huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in the hull. \nINT. SHIP KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nas the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun, moving onward. \nPONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS \nSomeone is crouched behind a massive convection oven, spying on McCulloch. \nMCCULLOCH \nalmost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense. \nINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME \nSean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, trying to think, talking to himself. \nSEAN Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly... \nRENNIE Is the ship going to sink?? \nHe returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in. \nSEAN I don't know. \nHer ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on. \nSEAN The emergency lights just kicked in... \nSean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant to convince himself as much as Rennie. \nSEAN We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case. \nRENNIE (terrified) I'm not going near any lifeboat! \nSEAN But Rennie... \nRENNIE I'm not!! \nINT. SHIP RESTAURANT ROOM - SAME TIME \nas Miss Van Deusen gathers a handful of students who are panicking, sitting them down. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Everybody wait right here until I come back with the others -- understand? \nThey nod, frightened to death. She dashes away, carrying us into a view of the dining room windows. No one notices the SILHOUETTE OF JASON passing by on the outside desk. \nINT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX) \nSea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine bearings begin to GRIND. \nINT. SHIP HALLWAY - SAME TIME \nas McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door, cautiously entering with flare gun raised. \nMCCULLOCH Rennie?? \nMCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW \n", "test2_true": "MCCULLOCH \ncautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the knob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears something, spinning around. Again, nothing is there. McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few seconds pass. \nMCCULLOCH Come on, answer!! \nINT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME \nTIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE TO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck below through rain-streaked windows. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nMiss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up a trio of terrified seniors. \nRETURN TO SHOT \nJason methodically moves to the bank of switches, studying them. \nINSERT - CONSOLE \nIn large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the words \"ABANDON SHIP ALARM.\" He flips back the plastic safety cover, exposing the button. \nINT. BOWELS OF SHIP - SAME TIME \nA horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow corridor. Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end, coughing on the black smoke which clouds their passageway. Sean looks down, seeing that they are standing in a puddle of water. \nSEAN Water has gotten to the engines. (coughs) We have to get everybody off this ship... \nINSERT - ABANDON SHIP BUTTON \nas Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and: \nINT. BOWELS OF SHIP - CONTINUOUS \nA WHOOPING SIREN blasts through the passageway. Sean and Rennie have no time to react because: \nANGLE - CORRIDOR (EFX) \nA sealed compartment door EXPLODES OPEN WITH THE PRESSURE OF SEA WATER... \nREVERSE ANGLE (EFX) \n...and a WALL OF WATER ENGULFS.RENNIE AND SEAN, KNOCKING THEM DOWN. Sean fights to pull her up, but not in time for her to witness: \nWAYNE'S CHARRED CORPSE (EFX) \nwhich bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out, scrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's body washes past them. \nEXT. DECK - NIGHT \nas a door opens and Miss Van Deusen guides a half-dozen SENIORS over to the LIFEBOAT STATIONS. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN (shouting over storm) Everybody climb in! \nThey follow her orders as the Abandon Ship alarm wretches on. But little do they know that: \nSTALKING POINT OF VIEW \nSomeone is briskly moving towards the group and Miss Van Deusen. Just as we are within a few feet of her... \nREVERSE ANGLE \n--It's MCCULLOCH who's approached them. He grabs Miss Van Deusen, shaking her violently. \nMCCULLOCH What did you do with Rennie?? \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Nothing! I went to her cabin and... \nMcCulloch rushes off before she can finish. Miss Van Deusen turns back to the other kids, helping them into the boat. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN Everybody hurry...please... \nEXT. DECK - CLOSE ON MAHOGANY DECKING - SAME TIME \nWe slowly DOLLY BACKWARDS until Miles' AXE comes into frame, still stuck in the mahogany decking. A beat, then JASON'S HALAL DISLODGES IT FROM THE WOOD. \nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nas Sean climbs up from below, soaked to the bone, pulling up a half-conscious Rennie. Sean carries her around a corner, where he collides with McCulloch. McCulloch pulls Rennie away from him. \nMCCULLOCH She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault! \nSEAN This is Jason's fault! \nMCCULLOCH (shouting) Not another word, do you hear me?? \nEXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT \nas Miss Van Deusen throws the \"down\" lever and the lifeboat hoist begins to lower the boat. Camera SLOWLY CREEPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AS A SILHOUETTED FIGURE STEPS INTO A POOL OF LIGHT BEHIND HER. JASON. \nANGLE - LIFEBOAT \nOne of the students screams, the others clinging together upon the sight of this infamous monster. But the boat is already over the edge, past the point of return. And lowering at a snail's pace. \nMISS VAN DEUSEN \n", "test2_id": 2875, "test3_input": "SANITATION ENGINEER Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods out with the stuff on the 13th of every month, right at midnight. (checks watch) And that's less than ten minutes from now. \nRennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, swallowing hard. \nSANITATION ENGINEER Follow me. \nHe clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly leads them down: \nINT. TUNNEL #2 \n...no less threatening than the one they just left. When they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS HIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND SEAN. \nTHE FLASHLIGHT \nrolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically across the polluted walls. \nTHE SANITATION ENGINEER \nbegins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the monster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL \nRENNIE \ntries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the opposite wall, barely conscious. \nSEAN Run, Rennie... \nShe's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel #3, seeing: \nA GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL \nJason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull. \nRENNIE \nbacks away but does not run. The time has come to face her fears. \nANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL \nas Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him off. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated tool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for Sean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench over Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning directly into it. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nRennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in the reflective wet surroundings. \nRENNIE You never got me in the lake, Jason. And you're not going to get me now either. \nHer voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the irritating light never leaving us. \nJASON \nhas been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her. \nJASON'S POINT OF VIEW \nas the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down the intersecting tunnel (#1). \nTIGHT ON JASON'S FEET \nstomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's wanted to kill Rennie most of all. \nINT. TUNNEL #L \nas Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to crush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but still resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder. \nINT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON \nHe's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling after his fix. \nINSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM \nas the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately causing it to cave in. \nINT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW \n--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into Tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie flinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second later a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US... \nTIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION) \nand his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, SEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank buckshot. \nRENNIE \ndrops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again. \nCLOSE UP - JASON (EFX) \nas the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the plastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT CLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the chemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his eyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just broke, running down his face. \nCLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT \nas the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE TO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning sight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and RUNS. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nas Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie. \n", "test3_true": "as Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him, shaking hard. \nRENNIE Get up, Sean!!! \nHis eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable terror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING SOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the direction of her planned retreat: \nRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW \nAn ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the unthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at leaps and bounds. \nTIGHT ON RENNIE \nas her trembling chin rises, looking at: \nANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX) \nThe dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from the approaching flood. \nRENNIE \nrotates her head and sees: \nJASON \nvision or no vision, he is lurching towards her relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell and high water. \nRENNIE \ndrags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed woman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to the intersecting alcove wall. \nRENNIE (screaming) Climb!!! \nShe shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning everything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare back down the tunnel... \nRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX) \nThe overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her vision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING FROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms like the claws of a roto-tiller. \nANGLE - LADDER \nas Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing: \nJASON \nwithin ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder like he's working on some kind of radar. \nRENNIE \nslips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and rushing higher. She takes her final glance into the tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as she sees: \nINT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX) \nA million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into the far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING STRAIGHT FOR CAMERA. \nJASON \nhas just started to climb the ladder when the wind and smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His decomposed head swivels to face: \nINT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX) \nTons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in seconds. \nJASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS) \nHe doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses already know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE FIRST WORDS HE HAS EVER SPOKEN COME OUT, IN THE VOICE OF AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY: \nJASON Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN, MOMMY... \nCamera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into our eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS DROWNING IN IT. \nYOUNG JASON Hhhhelp me.... \nA split second later: \nEXT. TUNNEL #3 (EFX) (SLOW MOTION) \nThe wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON. \nINT. TUNNEL #3 - ON RENNIE AND SEAN (EFX) \nThe powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches below Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking their rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with their eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival. \nINT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX) \nWe are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over and under us. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX) \nThe digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES MIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER MANHATTAN. \nANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX) \nas the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her eyes, glancing straight down and seeing. \nRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX) \n", "test3_id": 2876}

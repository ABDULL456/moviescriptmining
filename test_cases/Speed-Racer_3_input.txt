SPRITTLE Speed! 
SPEED Sprittle? 
SECURITY GOON Mr. Remmington I caught these two snooping in a restricted area. 
REMMINGTON DRIVER Get this Racer trash out of my building. 
SPEED I'll see you at Fuji. Speed turns and heads for the elevator. 
REMMINGTON DRIVER Yes and then you'll realize that you just made the biggest mistake of your life! 
TNT. RACER KITCHEN -MORNING Close up on The Racing News that Sparky is reading from. The main headline: ANOTHER DIRTY RACER? 
CONTINUED: 
SPARKY ". .controversy surrounds Racer Motors now embroiled in IP litigation and while evidence remains inconclusive whether or not Speed used an illegal device, the Fuji Helexicon seems destined to become another mark of shame added to the notorious Racer family legacy, a legacy that has forever tainted the integrity of this beloved sport." 
MOM Sparky. That's enough. 
SPARKY Sorry ma'am. 
SPRITTLE I'm going to send that guy some Chim-chim cookies. Chim-chim guffaws. 
POPS You'll do no such thing. 
SPRITTLE We gotta do something, Pops. Speed steps into the doorway. 
SPEED This is exactly what he said would happen if I didn't drive for him. 
SPARKY You mean Remmington? 
SPEED He said it'd get worse and worse and by the end of the year you'd be filing for bankruptcy, Pops. 
SPRITTLE Okay, he's definitely gettin' some monkey cookies. 
MOM Sprittle! 
CONTINUED: (2 
POPS He was just trying to scare you, son. They tried the same thing with Rex. If it's a fight they want, it's a fight they'll get. 
SPEED How? What can we do? How can we fight this? He tosses the newspaper. 
POPS The truth will come out. 
SPEED The truth? Don't be naive, Pops. He leaves. 
INT. SPEED'S ROOM 
The Ben Burns poster is ripped from the wall. Speed wads its up and throws it into the garbage. He sinks down to his bed, a sense of powerlessness crushing the life out of him. Mom taps and then cracks the door. 
MOM Speed? Are you okay? 
SPEED .I don't know. She comes in and sits beside him, putting her arm around him. 
MOM It'll be okay. We'll get through it. 
SPEED I don't know, mom. I might have really messed things up. 
MOM How? 
SPEED By not joining Remmington. 
CONTINUED: 
MOM Don't be silly. You'd have never been happy driving for that terrible man. 
SPEED But maybe racing isn't about being happy. Maybe Remmington's right and it's all about business and anyone who doesn't understand that is just a chump. 
MOM Now you listen to me, young man. What you do behind the wheel of a racecar has nothing to do with business. Before you could even talk, you were making noises that sounded like a car engine. We used to tell people you were speaking car-ese. We used to try to take you to the park but you never wanted to get out of the car. 
SPEED .I loved that old wagon. 
MOM And do you remember the time Rex took you out to Thunderhead and let you drive-- Speed smiles. 
SPEED And I turned it over. 
MOM My heart still pounds just thinking about it. 
SPEED Rex told me the only reason we survived was because I was wearing red socks. 
MOM I thought your father was going to have a stroke when you walked in the door with that crazy smile. 
INT. RACER LIVING ROOM - PAST 
Ten year old Speed comes in the door, leading Rex, wearing a small bandage on his forehead, smiling, a big black gap where his two front teeth should be. 
MOM I don't think I ever saw you as happy as you were telling anybody who asked, how you lost your two front teeth in your first crash. 
INT. SPEED'S ROOM - PRESENT 
MOM Speed, when I watch you do some of the things you do, I feel like I'm watching someone paint or play music. When I go to the races, I go to watch you make art and it's beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be, even though there are times when I have to close my eyes. But then there are other times, when you just take my breath away and it's at those moments, when I feel your father's chest swell and I know he's smiling, trying to pretend he doesn't have tears in his eyes, I just go to pieces.

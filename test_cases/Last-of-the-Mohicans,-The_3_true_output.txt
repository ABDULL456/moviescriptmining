MONTCALM Granted. 
MUNRO My colors? 
MONTCALM Carry them to England to your King with pride. 
MUNRO Allow me to consult with my officers. 
As he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put back together. As the men move away from the French ... 
MUNRO I have lived to see two things I never expected. An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage. 
HEYWARD General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight. 
MUNRO (flares) Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not. 
Munro looks at the fortress behind him. 
HEYWARD Sir! 
MUNRO (stops him with his eyes) The decision is final. 
A beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across the churned, scarred earth of the battlefield. 
MUNRO I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon. 
MONTCALM Granted, Monsieur. 
And Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ... 
CUT TO ... 
EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - CLOAKED MAN - NIGHT 
passes away from the little city of tents in the direction of the beach and towards William Henry. He seems to head towards a vantage point from which to observe the fort. As he approaches a sentry: 
SENTRY Qui vive? 
MONTCALM France. 
SENTRY Le mot d'ordre? 
MONTCALM La victoire. 
SENTRY C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur! 
MONTCALM Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant. 
The cloak parts. By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly perceived by us and the soldier as General Montcalm. The soldier snaps erect as Montcalm continues walking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees. 
ANOTHER ANGLE: MONTCALM 
The moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind Montcalm; from the front of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure. 
MAGUA Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father? 
MONTCALM Yes. 
MAGUA Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends. 
MONTCALM My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer. 
MAGUA Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried. 
MONTCALM But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired? 
MAGUA Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need. (threatening) And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation. 
MONTCALM That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well. 
Magua grabs the hand of the French commander. Imperceptible surprise in Montcalm's eyes. Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest. 
MAGUA Does my father know that? 
MAGUA'S CHEST 
A deep indentation and scar. 
MONTCALM That's where a lead bullet has torn you. 
MAGUA And this? 
Magua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand on his back ... 	deep ridges of a scar a half inch wide.] 
MONTCALM My son has been sadly injured. Who did this? 
MAGUA (laughs; sardonic) Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. And the sticks left their mark ... (pause; for real) Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English. Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this. (pause) In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron. And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead! 
MONTCALM My son Magua's pain is my pain. 
MAGUA Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms? 
MONTCALM Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake. Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south. (pause; shrugs) And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France ...

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)(PRE-LAP) So he trust you now. 
EXT. BOWLING GREEN PARK - DAY 
The iconic charging bull of Wall Street. 
JACOB (V.O.) I think so. Travel the park to find... Jacob and Gordon stopping at the food vendors. 
GORDON GEKKO Well, I'm happy to help. 
(AND THEN) What about your end of the trade, Sport? 
JACOB Oh... I'm still working on it. 
(BEAT) I'll talk to her. I promise. 
GORDON GEKKO 
(TO VENDOR) Hot dog. 
(TO JACOB) What do you want? 
JACOB 
(TO VENDOR) I'll take a pretzel. As they get their food and walk... 
GORDON GEKKO So you're a hedge fund cowboy now? Shaking his head... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) Goddamn hedge funds -- what a racket. Playing the world casino, betting other people's money with leverage. And it's completely legal and completely unregulated. 
(MORE) 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) The hustles they get away with make insider trading seem like a parking ticket. 
SLAM INTO THE FRONTIER FUND/TRADING PIT Rows and rows of computers in a large dark room.... 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) Nassim Tariq and his Frontier Fund. With their slews of MIT grads who become glorified millionaire robots pushing buttons... ... with casually dressed ASIANS and INDIANS in their 20s working the keyboards like zombies. 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... slaves to top-secret propriety elegant algorithms that work until they don't. 
AND SLAM INTO ESSEX CAPITAL ADVISERS/CONFERENCE ROOM A stuffy conference room half-filled with bored MEN in their 40s watching a presentation... 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) Or the baby cub funds like Sammy Rosen's Essex Advisers... filled with Goldman Sachs and Julian Robertson pedigree. Most of the men type on their blackberrys... one is actually asleep. 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) Men who are way too rich, lazy and tired to run money properly anymore. 
THEN SLAM INTO THE DANIELS ACTIVIST FUND/ALLAN DANIELS'S 
OFFICE A small cluttered office with papers strewn about... 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) Or Allan Daniel's and his bully operation. ALLAN DANIELS, a small bull-dog of a man, paces back and forth... dictating in anger. His SECRETARY types down every word he's shouting. 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... with his angry letters to company boards that are nothing but veiled threats in the name of activism. 
AND RIGHT BACK TO BOWLING GREEN PARK Where Gordon stops walking... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) So you're inside... you have his trust... and now you want to know what's next. And Jacob's look over to Gekko confirms this. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) Here's the thing about Bretton. He puts all of his money into his own fund which makes him stupid, egotistical, and most importantly... vulnerable. 
(BEAT) And he chases. He doesn't take losses well and he chases with leverage. He thinks he's a trader, he thinks he's an investor but he's not. He's a gambler. Regarding Jacob... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) That pretzel looks good. Jacob just shrugs. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) Care to make a trade? 
JACOB Whatever. And they trade. The hotdog for the pretzel. 
GORDON GEKKO As for your end of our trade. 
(BEAT) Find a way for me to reunite with my daughter, Jake. Because we both know how she would react to the fact that you've been lying to her about bonding with your future father-in-law. Just standing there... holding that hot dog... 
JACOB Is that a threat? Looking Jacob dead on... 
GORDON GEKKO Absolutely. Jacob just shakes his head with a laugh... now realizing that Gekko talked him into this position for this exact leverage. 
JACOB You're priceless, Gordon.

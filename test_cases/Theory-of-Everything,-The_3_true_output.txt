JANE I wish. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   54 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN Mezzo? 
JANE (POINTING DOWNWARDS) Alto. 
JONATHAN Well--Just what we need. (to last departing CHORISTER) 'Bye, Kate. (TO JANE) Where have you been hiding? 
JANE Good question. 
JONATHAN Well, you're here now. And just in time. 
JANE (SMILES) Am I? 
JONATHAN Yes. So tell me. (squints, thinking) Chopin! Yes? Your repertoire. 
JANE I wouldn't call it a repertoire. Brahms--I know a little- 
JONATHAN Brahms! Wonderful. Perfect. We - 
JONATHAN gets an idea, he moves then stops... 
JONATHAN (CONT'D) Okay. Which...? 
JANE Well, I have sung--"Immer leiser." 
JONATHAN Ah! "My sleep grows evermore peaceful." Come on. Follow me. Come on. Let me hear you. Come on. 
He sets off up to the front of the church. She turns, smiling, as he WAVES for her to follow him. She follows. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   55 
INT. FRONT AREA, CHURCH - EVENING 
At the front of the church she sees that he is already sitting at the piano. Without sheet music he begins to play "Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer"... 
JONATHAN (over the music) Jonathan. Jonathan Hellyer Jones. 
She gingerly approaches. 
JANE Jane. Jane Hawking. 
JONATHAN In C-sharp minor? The introduction, so lovely. From the top? 
JANE Now? 
JONATHAN "Living on the edge." (SMILES) Ready? (BEAT) If you're not in the mood we could absolutely forget - 
JANE No, no. No, no. Just let me remember the lyrics. In English. 
JONATHAN Fabulous. 
JANE Okay. 
JONATHAN Okay? (BEAT) Two, three... 
JANE (SINGS) My sleep grows ever quieter only my grief, like a veil, lies trembling over me. I often hear you in my dreams calling outside my door...(etc) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   56 
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
JANE and JONATHAN emerge from the church - JONATHAN locks the doors. 
JONATHAN Actually, no, I go for the Gospel of St. Mark. 
JANE None of that wishy-washy do-gooder stuff--Matthew, Luke. 
JONATHAN Exactly. With Mark you roll up your sleeves and get stuck in. No standing on the sidelines. 
They shake hands. JANE stares into his face - realizing she has found a friend. 
JANE Well I should be going. 
JONATHAN Well met. Oh, and if your daughter would like those piano lessons. 
JANE Absolutely. My husband loves music too. 
JONATHAN I could teach him as well.

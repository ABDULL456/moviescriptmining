He'll teach you how to be a great cop. \nEllie straightens.  Smiles.  Looks over at Will. \nELLIE Yes, sir. \nCHIEF NYBACK That's all, for now. \nEllie, realises they want to be alone. \nELLIE Oh.  Right.  Okay. \nBacks out.  Quietly closing the door behind her.  Will unbuttons his jacket.  Takes a seat. \nWILL Nice kid. \nCHIEF NYBACK (sits with a SIGH) Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it. \nWill surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack. \nWILL Keeping you busy up here, Charlie? \nHap picks up a cheap trophy.  Reads the base. \nHAP \"2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch.\" \nCHIEF NYBACK I told you seven years ago this was a stepping stone to retirement. \nNyback nods to Hap's Seattle Times.  The headline:  \"Deeper Investigation into Special Branch\"... \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Looks like it's a good time for you to get up here, too.  With all the bad business going on down at Special Branch. \nWill and Hap share a look.  No more joking.  Hap folds over the paper. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Just five bad apples so far? \nWILL So far. \nCHIEF NYBACK What's the D.A. got them on? \nWILL Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft. \nNyback winces. \nCHIEF NYBACK How about you?  How you faring? \nHAP They're all over us, Charlie. \nWILL They're all over everybody. \nHAP I.A.'s calling themselves the \"Corruption Task Force.\"  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or \"oversights\" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night. \nNyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk. \nCHIEF NYBACK Got a bunch of messages here from some guy named Warfield. \nHap tosses a glance over at Will. \nWILL That's I.A.'s pit bull. \nCHIEF NYBACK Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here. \nNyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the trash. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) I'm just glad Buck could spare you a couple of weeks.  Take you out of the frenzy.  I gotta tell you, though, I sure don't miss big city police work.  Not that I was ever a great detective.  But up here there's no Bureaucracy.  No Public Relations.  No blurred lines. Just good guys and bad guys.  Simple. \nA cloud passes over his face. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Except for this. \nHolds up a file.  The name written on the lip:  KAY CONNELL. \nINT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER \nNyback leads Will and Hap down a hallway.  Crooked plaques and black-and-white pictures line the walls. \nCHIEF NYBACK Couldn't get a thing from the body.  Not a trace.  Town's never dealt with anything like this before. \nThey turn a corner and stop at a door.  Will glances up: MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over it. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) I've briefed everybody about your coming. They know to follow your lead. \nNyback opens the door onto... \nINT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS \n...the bullpen of Nightmute PD.  Wooden desks, a couple computers, a jumbled corkboard, an impressive gun cabinet.  A RADIO's playing. \nThree MEN look over.  A young uniformed cop and two guys with heavy facial hair, Timberland boots, and flannel shirts.  One of them's part Inuit.  Ellie sits in the back.  Reaches over to turn off the radio. \nWill and Hap stand in the doorway.  Sticking out like sore thumbs in their suits.  Nyback jerks his thumb towards them. \nCHIEF NYBACK This is Detective Dormer and his partner Detective Eckhart.  On loan from Buck Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide Special Branch.  They'll be helping with the Connell case. \nThe Inuit, FRED DUGGAR, snorts.  Takes his feet of the desk. \nFRED Helping? \nCHIEF NYBACK (ignoring him) Anything they need to see, you show them; anywhere they want to go, you take them. (nods to Fred) This is Detective Fred Duggar.  He's been leading the investigation up to now. \nWill puts out his hand. \n", "test1_true": "Fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache.  Stands. \nFRED Suppose you want to see the body. \nEXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY \nFred steps out of the station, pulls on a baseball cap. \nFRED We can walk from here. \nHe heads off across the parking lot.  Will and Hap exchange a glance. \nWILL Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality. \nELLIE (O.S.) Don't worry about him... \nThey turn.  Ellie's come up behind them.  Looks over at the hunched figure to Fred. \nELLIE (cont'd) He's just mad 'cause you're taking over. \nFred stops up ahead.  Sees her.  Annoyed. \nFRED Ellie!  Go type something! \nINT. NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - LATER \nCLOSE ON a faucet.  A bead of water, quivering at the mouth. Falls with a BLIP! \nCORONER (O.S.) Did a fundascopic examination and found papilledema and petechiae of the retina. \nPULL BACK to reveal Will, Hap, and the COUNTY CORONER standing by a stainless steel table.  The naked body of KAY CONNELL is laid out before them.  Fred hangs back. \nThe coroner tugs at her surgical gloves.  She's in her late seventies. \nCORONER (cont'd) Clear cause of death was herniation of the brain stem due to intracerebral hemorrhage. \nHAP Beaten to death. \nCORONER Beaten to death. \nWill points to the bruises on the body's shoulders and breasts. \nWILL What about these contusions? \nCORONER Superficial. \nWILL Any signs of rape? \nCORONER None. \nThe coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet. \nCORONER (cont'd) She was a nice girl.  Played flute with my granddaughter. \nWill stays her hand. \nWILL Wait. \nHe pulls the sheet back down.  Studying the body of Kay Connell.  Starts walking slowly around the table.  In his element.  The faucet drips.  Drips.  Drips. \nHe bends down to smell her hair. \nWILL (cont'd) He washed her hair. \nTakes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers. \nWILL (cont'd) Combed it. \nContinues around the table.  Picks up one of her hands. Examines her fingers, her nails. \nWILL (cont'd) Cleaned under her fingernails.  Clipped them. \nContinues down around her feet.  Checks between her first and second toes. \nWILL (cont'd) Toes, too. (to Fred) You found nothing on the body? \nFRED No. \nWILL No fibers, skin flakes, hairs... \nFRED Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here. \nWill stands there.  Looking down at the body.  Slim.  Young. Beautiful.  Skin like marble. \nWILL He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks. \nHAP Even the best make mistakes. \nWill looks up and locks eyes with his partner. \nINT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT \nWill and Hap enter the lobby of the Pioneer Lodge.  Big stone fireplace and heavy ceiling beams.  MOOSE ANTLERS mounted above reception.  They put their bags down by the desk.  Look around. \nRACHEL (O.S.) Lower forty-eight. \nThey turn.  RACHEL CLEMENT stands in a doorway behind the desk.  Dunking a teabag into a mug.  Long dark hair and intelligent eyes. \nHAP Lower forty-eight? \nRACHEL You're not from here.  I can tell by your walk. \nHAP Oh?  And how's that? \n", "test1_id": 2190, "test2_input": "RACHEL Unsure. \nHap smiles at her.  Will checks his watch. \nWILL Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart. There should be a reservation for us. \nRachel looks at him.  Goes to a small file box on the desk. \nRACHEL (to Hap) Your friend's all business. \nWILL I'm always all business. \nHe glances out the window.  It's as bright as day. \nWILL (cont'd) Is it really 9:30? \nRACHEL (nods) Alaskan summers.  Hope you're an easy sleeper.  It'll be like this all night. \nShe hands them two cards. \nRACHEL (cont'd) Sign here. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWill's taken off his jacket and is unpacking.  The room is sparse and creaky.  Bed dips in the middle.  He hangs a jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase.  Pulls out his SMITH AND WESSON 45. \nLays it on the bedside table.  Takes out a shoulder holster. A back holster.  A handful of shells.  Lays them on the table.  Then a small SMITH AND WESSON 39/13 9MM.  Checks the magazine. \nThere's a KNOCK on the adjoining door. \nHAP (O.S.) Me. \nWill SLAPS the magazine back. \nWILL Come on in. \nHap opens the door.  A glimpse into his room: family PICTURES on his bedside table - a WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS. \nHAP See you have the same decor as my room. \nHe walks over to the big window.  It overlooks the harbor. Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance.  One lone TUGBOAT in the harbor towing a freighter. \nHAP (cont'd) Same view, too. (looks out) I've been watching that tugboat for the last half hour.  So small, pulling all that weight. (beat) We have to talk, Will. \nWill reaches into his suitcase.  Pulls out a shirt. \nWILL What do you want to talk about? \nHAP You know what about. \nWill throws him a look. \nWILL We'll talk when we get back to Seattle. \nHAP When's that, a week?  Two weeks?... (heads over to him) We have to figure out a plan of action now. \nWILL You know my plan of action. \nHAP To do nothing. \nWILL That's right. \nHAP Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  Five hours.  Asking all kinds of questions... \nWILL He's asking everybody questions. \nHAP But he's zeroing in on me.  On us. Everyone's talking about it. \nWILL He's just rattling your cage. \nHAP Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard. \nWILL We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that. \nWill goes back to his suitcase.  Hap follows.  A thin film of sweat on his upper lip. \nHAP (lowers voice) Look.  We've tampered with evidence. We've pushed witnesses.  We've planted shit.  And they're sniffing around like dogs.  Especially on the Dobbs case... \nWill flares up.  Struck a nerve.  Turns to his partner. \nWILL Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that? \nHAP You know I remember that. \nWILL One word to I.A. and he walks. \nHAP Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck... \nWILL No way. \nHAP Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing... \nWILL Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am not going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions. \nHe grabs a hanger. \nHAP Goddammit, Will.  You grab on to something and you don't let it go. \nHe takes out a handkerchief.  Wipes his brow. \nHAP I don't know if it's because you think it's the right thing to do or because your pride won't let you do anything else.  I can't tell any more. (steps back) But I can tell you one thing.  I'm getting too old for this cowboy cop stuff.  Breaking the rules.  Cleaning up messes.  We're a dying breed, Will. You're a dying breed.  I.A., the D.A., all those reporters - they don't care what you did at Leland Street seven years ago.  They don't care that you've made this your life.  They don't care about getting the bad guy... \nWill turns on his partner, eyes burning. \n", "test2_true": "The partners, lock eyes.  Years of working together.  A thousand things unsaid.  Hap reaches for the door. \nHAP (cont'd) They're watching us, Will.  Like it or not.  They're watching us. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWill's asleep.  Kay Connell's folder open on his chest.  It's dark in his room, quiet.  Suddenly the shade on his window quivers and SNAPS up, flooding the room with light. \nWill's eyes pop open.  He rolls over to look at the clock: 3:15.  Squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window. We can see the rest of his scar.  Runs down deep across his sternum. \nHe yanks the shade back down.  It bucks, then settles. Satisfied, Will returns to bed.  Plumps the pillow, pulls the blanket up around him.  Closes his eyes. \nThe shade lurches halfway.  Then SNAPS back up.  Light pours in.  Will's eyes open. \nWILL You got to be kidding me. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHTMUTE - DAY \nWill jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat around his collar.  He looks out over the harbor.  Fishing boats coming in with their early morning haul.  More halibut. He checks his watch.  Slows to a walk.  Looks up and sees... \nEllie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge. Smiles.  Holds up some car keys. \nELLIE Fred wants us to meet him at the Connell's. \nINT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY \nEllie driving.  A hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view mirror.  Will in the passenger seat.  Wearing a crisp suit. Ellie hands him a take-out bag. \nELLIE Brought you a bear claw.  Just in case you were hungry. \nWill takes the bag.  Looks inside.  Yikes. \nELLIE (cont'd) Local delicacy. \nWILL Think I'll pass. \nHe puts the bag on the dash.  Looks out the window. Nightmute's main street.  A line of shops.  Undistinguished Town Hall.  Elementary school up on a hill.  Sign out front: Sign-ups for Midnight Little League! \nWILL (cont'd) What kind of calls you get around here? \nELLIE Oh.  You know.  Small-time stuff. Nothing like what you must get.  Mostly drinking-related problems.  Domestic abuse.  Barroom fights.  Stuff like that. \nShe shifts down.  Takes a steep turn. \nELLIE (cont'd) In the summer months it's pretty quiet. That's when there's work out on the boats.  The rest of the year, though... \nThey pass a MAN walking along the road.  Gnarled walking stick.  Ellie calls out the window. \nELLIE (cont'd) Hey, there, Joe! \nJOE waves.  They pass. \nELLIE (cont'd) That's Joe Willy.  Took his family hostage in November.  That was the most exciting thing that happened last year. I wasn't there, though. (grinds gear) Chief barely lets me handle anything above a misdemeanor. \nWill looks over at her.  Smiles. \nWILL Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap. \nELLIE But they're so boring.  All small stuff. \nWILL It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature. \nHe looks over.  Ellie's listening intently. \nWILL (cont'd) Aren't you going to write that down? \nEllie, searching her pockets for something to write with... \nELLIE Let me just... \nStops.  Looks over.  Realises Will's teasing her. \nEXT. CONNELL HOUSE - DAY \nA small ranch house.  Aluminum siding.  FLOWERS piled up by the front door.  TEDDY BEARS.  RIBBONS.  Left by well-wishers. \nMRS. CONNELL (O.S.) I haven't tidied up, since Fred told me not to touch anything. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONNELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nMRS. CONNELL, a big woman with a thick grey braid down her back, opens the door to her daughter's room.  Looks at Will. \nMRS. CONNELL I don't believe in keeping a child's room like a shrine. \nWill heads into the room.  Hap follows.  A palpable uneasiness between them.  Fred and Ellie stand in the doorway.  Mrs. Connell turns to go. \nINT. KAY CONNELL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA small bedroom.  Pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on the ceiling.  Pictures cut from magazines pasted on the walls.  A stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner. \nWill stands in the middle of the room.  Taking it in. \nWILL Typical seventeen year-old. (beat) She went to a party Friday night? \nELLIE Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in. \nFred throws Ellie a look.  \"Kids?\"  She's practically a kid herself.  Will opens the top drawer of the bureau.  Roots beneath the panties. \nWILL No diary. \nOn top of the bureau, a stack of photos.  A couple torn up. Kay Connell and a GIRL with white-blonde hair.  Laughing. \nFRED She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out. \n", "test2_id": 2191, "test3_input": "Will pours himself a cup of coffee.  Trying to keep the stream steady.  Ellie continues typing...CLACK...CLACK... \nWILL That's right. \nFRED Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house. (opens it up) It's signed.  Personally. \nWILL So? \nFRED This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out. \nCLACK...CLACK...CLACK...Will rubs his chin.  Looks back at the report.  Judicious. \nWILL I don't think it'll lead anywhere. \nThe CLACKING stops.  SILENCE.  Will turns around.  Ellie's staring right at him - that isn't like him. \nHe turns back to Fred.  Beat. \nWILL (cont'd) Well.  If he's local.  Give him a call. \nThe CLACKING resumes. \nINT. STAIRWAY - DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - LATE NIGHT \nA dark stairway.  Late at night.  Will, bathed in shadows. Climbs to the top.  Quietly, carefully.  He heads down a hallway.  We recognise it.  Back where Walter Byrd lives. \nWill approaches apartment \"B.\"  Slowly pulls out his weapon. Cocks it.  Waits a beat then swings out in front of the door. Ready to fight.  Ready to confront.  Looks down... \nTile corner's still there. \nINT./EXT. CHEROKEE - UMKUMIUT - NEXT DAY \nCLOSE ON Walter Byrd's APPOINTMENT BOOK laying open. Scrawled in pencil:  8:30.  Dr. Agee. \nPULL BACK to reveal Will sitting in the parked Cherokee.  The appointment book on the passenger seat.  Been there all night. \nInsomnia.  Taking its toll.  His hair, no longer neatly combed.  His face, pale and unshaven.  His eyes, dragged open from fatigue.  Looks like the whole world's pulling him down. Staring down the street at a \nBRICK BUILDING on the corner.  A placard by the front door: Dr. Florence Agee, D.D.S. \nWill checks his watch.  Rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands.  Suddenly.  Something tells him to look up. \nA MAN \nin the distance, walking along the road.  Towards Dr. Agee's. He's in his forties.  Short, shoulders sloped.  Wears a beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots. \nWALTER BYRD \nhas a bulky hearing aid in one ear.  Is looking down at the road.  Glances up. \nLOCKS EYES WITH WILL \nByrd, slows his pace. \nWill, reaches for the door handle. \nSUDDENLY \nByrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast. \nWill leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him. \nWALTER BYRD \nhis short legs pumping, spots a TOUR BUS across the road. Veers over to it. \nWILL \na runner's stride.  Weaves through PEOPLE.  Closing in on Byrd.  Sees his plan.  Cuts across the road just as... \nA PICK-UP \nrounds the corner.  THUMP!  Broadsides him.  Will's pitched up and over the hood.  Falls hard on the tarmac.  Dazed for a second.  Blood, gushing from his forehead.  Hears the PICK-UP DOOR open...FEET running over to him. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Are you alright?  You popped out from nowhere! \nMore FEET running over. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) He okay? \nWill opens his eyes.  Trying to focus.  Looks up and sees, in the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus. \nWill struggles to his feet.  The OLD LADY who hit him, wearing overalls.  Reaches out. \nOLD LADY I don't think you should move. \nWill stands, wavering.  Flashes her his badge. \nINT./EXT. PICK-UP \nThe old lady rips along in the truck.  Will sits in the passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead.  It's soaked with blood.  The lady looks over. \nOLD LADY You sure you're okay? \nWILL I'm fine. \nOLD LADY Careful not to bleed on my interior. \nWill looks over at her.  Shifts in his seat.  Ouch.  Feels like a couple cracked ribs.  Peers out the windshield at the TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them. \nEXT. WINDY ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nAERIAL VIEW of the pick-up tailing the tour bus.  A windy coastal road.  Beyond it, a blanket of endless evergreens. \n", "test3_true": "A FERRY at the end of the pier.  A small wooden booth for selling tickets.  Beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains on the other side of the bay.  Nothing else for miles around. \nThe pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars. Will jumps out.  Scans the area for Byrd.  Nothing.  Then, sees the last few PEOPLE boarding the ferry. \nINT. FERRY - MINUTES LATER \nFerry's getting pitched around in the roiling water.  Most everyone is inside.  TOURISTS with throw-away cameras, backpacks, anoraks, CHILDREN.  Some looking sea-sick in the corner. \nWill weaves through the crowd.  Eyes darting, searching.  The ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, Will spots \nWALTER BYRD standing by a window. \nINT. WINDOW - FERRY \nWalter holds on to the railing.  Looking at the view, the sea spray.  Will comes up.  Stands next to him.  Cognizant of the people around them. \nWILL Walter Byrd. \nWalter continues looking out the window.  That same stuffed- nose voice. \nWALTER When I was seven my mother and grandmother took me to Vancouver.  We were walking along the street one day when these two men ran past and snatched my grandmother's purse right from under her arm.  Right from under her arm.  That night a police officer came to our hotel room to ask us questions.  Stood the whole time. \nThe ferry pitches again.  Will grabs on to the railing. Looking down at this little man.  Hate in his eyes. \nWALTER (cont'd) His uniform looked brand new.  His shoes and badge were polished, his billy club, his belt buckle.  All perfect.  He was like a soldier, but better. \nWalter reaches up to blow his nose.  Will's eyes look on in disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen.  From beating Kay Connell to death. \nWALTER (cont'd) Made a huge impression on me.  His goodness.  Gave me an instant respect for the police.  I tried to become a cop when I left high school, but... \nHe points to his hearing-aid. \nWALTER (cont'd) Congenital problem. \nThe ferry's engine HUMS to a stop.  Walter smiles. \nWALTER (cont'd) Oh.  We're here. \nEXT. GENDREAU GLACIER - DAY \nGendreau Glacier.  Spilling down between two huge mountains. Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power. \nWill and Walter walk up its face, away from the other tourists.  Walter leads the way.  Hands in his pockets. \nWALTER You know this glacier moves a quarter of an inch every day? \nHe points off to the horizon. \nWALTER (cont'd) And on a clear day you can see all the way over to Newtok.  There's a beautiful aviary over there.  We can go sometime. \nWill's lip curls.  Watching him. \nWALTER (cont'd) It's actually cool for this time of year. Normally the temperature runs about... \nSUDDENLY Will lunges at him.  Walter's eyes widen in surprise as he grabs him up by the collar.  Nose to nose.  Will barely keeping control. \nWILL You think this is a nice meeting we're having here?  Friendly?  Two people getting acquainted? (jerks him harder) You sick, coward, fuck.  I get up every morning of my life just to bring someone like you down.  Beating a seventeen year- old girl to death.  Washing her afterwards, cleaning her.  Make you feel like a real man? (tightens his grip) Huh? \nWalter flounders. \nWILL (cont'd) I outta end this right now.  Take a rock and smash your fucking skull in... \nHis jaws tense, nostrils flare.  Walter, red-faced, sputtering... \nWALTER I stood right behind you...I saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him... \nWill clenches his teeth. \nWALTER (cont'd) ...Seattle's great hero.  Shooting his own partner.  I saw it all... \nWILL That was an accident!  You hear me?  I didn't know it was him! (shakes him hard) I didn't know it was him! \nJust then a SHRIEK.  Will looks over \nA COUPLE KIDS.  Further down the glacier.  Having a snowball fight. \nWill looks back at Walter.  Has to take it easy.  Shoves him away in disgust.  Walter falls down onto the snow.  Dislodges his hearing aid. \nWatches Will pace.  Head throbbing.  Ribs, screaming in pain. \nWALTER Then why lie about it? \nWalter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.  Puts it back around his ear. \nWALTER (cont'd) I mean, I'm all for bending the truth. That's what I do in my novels.  It's my trade you might say.  But why cover it up? \nGets up.  Brushes the snow from his butt.  Checks something in his pocket. \nWALTER (cont'd) You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.  I'm sure you have some reason. Something noble.  I have faith in that. \nLooks down at the kids.  Shakes his head. \nWALTER (cont'd) They should be bundled up better. \nWILL What's your game, Byrd? \nWalter turns back to him. \nWALTER No game. \nWILL The phone call.  The knapsack. \nWalter shrugs. \n", "test3_id": 2192}

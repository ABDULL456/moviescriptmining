{"train": "Insomnia \nby \nH. Seitz \nFADE IN: \nOn credit sequence... \nAN ARM \nstretched out.  Long, alabaster white.  Beautiful.  A WASH CLOTH enters frame.  Starts washing the arm with long, tender strokes. \nA TUMBLE OF HAIR \nthick and auburn.  Being gently washed. \nFINGERNAILS \nbeing clipped with a shiny nail clipper.  Short.  Uniform. Tidy. \nEYEBROWS \nbrown with a touch of gold.  A BRUSH comes into view. Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again.  Against. Then back again. \nPANTY-HOSE \npulled gingerly off a long leg.  Folded neatly.  The wash cloth begins between the toes.  Warm, soapy water. \nHAIR \nnow dry.  The HAND appears with a comb.  Pulls down through the thick tresses. \nIt is only now that we see the hand is wearing a SURGICAL GLOVE. \nThe gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from it.  Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag.  In the bag we see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail clippings. \nGoes back to combing.  Comes across a knot and yanks the comb through.  The HEAD rolls over to us.  Her face is bruised, her eyes blank.  She is lying on the floor. \nDead. \nEnd of credit sequence. \nINT. BUSH PLANE - THE KILBUCK MOUNTAINS, ALASKA - DAY \nThe loud THRUM of a bush plane.  We CLOSE ON a small, cloudy window.  Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees. \nHAP (O.S.) Jesus.  Just look at all that. \nPULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side by side.  Hap's at the window.  Greying moustache, a little pudgy, wearing a brown suit.  Holding a folded over Seattle Times. \nHAP (cont'd) I thought we had a population problem. Everyone should just move up here. (taps window) Just look at it, Will. \nWill's eyes remain on the file on his lap. \nWILL I don't need to look at it. \nWill Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit. Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him. \nHAP Nothing wrong with smelling the roses. \nWill looks up.  We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his Adam's apple.  There's tension between him and Hap, just below the surface.  He taps the file. \nWILL Tell that to her, partner. \nANGLE ON THE FILE \na stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS.  Of the dead girl.  Her eyes puffed up from bruises.  The whites bloody.  Contusions along her breasts and shoulders. \nPILOT (O.S.) Detective? \nThe PILOT's looking back at Will.  Wearing a leather red baron hat. \nPILOT (cont'd) Better check your belts.  We'll be landing in about fifteen minutes. \nWill nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of them.  Looks at Will. \nEXT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS \nThe small yellow plane veers left.  Clears a mountain top and gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline.  The green of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock of the beaches.  Enormous. \nEXT. LANDING STRIP - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY \nA SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska.  Halibut Fishing Capital of the World! \nPULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small, corrugated building.  The \"airport.\"  Nothing else for miles around. \nA mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it.  Brakes SCREECHING.  A YOUNG WOMAN hops out.  About 23.  Petite with short, brown hair. \nPeers up at the sky.  Brightens at the sight of the BUSH PLANE coming in for landing.  Smooths down her down vest. Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible.  Nervous. Excited. \nOLD MAN (O.S.) Eleanor? \nELLIE BURR turns.  Shields her eyes from the sun.  An OLD MAN hosing down the side of the building. \nELLIE Hey, Mr. Angstrom! \nMR. ANGSTROM What're you doing here? \nEllie puffs up. \nELLIE Police business. \nHe starts back over to his desk.  Notices Ellie still standing by the door.  Points to Will. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Pay attention to this man, Ellie.  He'll teach you how to be a great cop. \nEllie straightens.  Smiles.  Looks over at Will. \nELLIE Yes, sir. \nCHIEF NYBACK That's all, for now. \nEllie, realises they want to be alone. \nELLIE Oh.  Right.  Okay. \nBacks out.  Quietly closing the door behind her.  Will unbuttons his jacket.  Takes a seat. \nWILL Nice kid. \nCHIEF NYBACK (sits with a SIGH) Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it. \nWill surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack. \nWILL Keeping you busy up here, Charlie? \nHap picks up a cheap trophy.  Reads the base. \nHAP \"2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch.\" \nCHIEF NYBACK I told you seven years ago this was a stepping stone to retirement. \nNyback nods to Hap's Seattle Times.  The headline:  \"Deeper Investigation into Special Branch\"... \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Looks like it's a good time for you to get up here, too.  With all the bad business going on down at Special Branch. \nWill and Hap share a look.  No more joking.  Hap folds over the paper. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Just five bad apples so far? \nWILL So far. \nCHIEF NYBACK What's the D.A. got them on? \nWILL Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft. \nNyback winces. \nCHIEF NYBACK How about you?  How you faring? \nHAP They're all over us, Charlie. \nWILL They're all over everybody. \nHAP I.A.'s calling themselves the \"Corruption Task Force.\"  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or \"oversights\" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night. \nNyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk. \nCHIEF NYBACK Got a bunch of messages here from some guy named Warfield. \nHap tosses a glance over at Will. \nWILL That's I.A.'s pit bull. \nCHIEF NYBACK Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here. \nNyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the trash. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) I'm just glad Buck could spare you a couple of weeks.  Take you out of the frenzy.  I gotta tell you, though, I sure don't miss big city police work.  Not that I was ever a great detective.  But up here there's no Bureaucracy.  No Public Relations.  No blurred lines. Just good guys and bad guys.  Simple. \nA cloud passes over his face. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Except for this. \nHolds up a file.  The name written on the lip:  KAY CONNELL. \nINT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER \nNyback leads Will and Hap down a hallway.  Crooked plaques and black-and-white pictures line the walls. \nCHIEF NYBACK Couldn't get a thing from the body.  Not a trace.  Town's never dealt with anything like this before. \nThey turn a corner and stop at a door.  Will glances up: MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over it. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) I've briefed everybody about your coming. They know to follow your lead. \nNyback opens the door onto... \nINT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS \n...the bullpen of Nightmute PD.  Wooden desks, a couple computers, a jumbled corkboard, an impressive gun cabinet.  A RADIO's playing. \nThree MEN look over.  A young uniformed cop and two guys with heavy facial hair, Timberland boots, and flannel shirts.  One of them's part Inuit.  Ellie sits in the back.  Reaches over to turn off the radio. \nWill and Hap stand in the doorway.  Sticking out like sore thumbs in their suits.  Nyback jerks his thumb towards them. \nCHIEF NYBACK This is Detective Dormer and his partner Detective Eckhart.  On loan from Buck Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide Special Branch.  They'll be helping with the Connell case. \nThe Inuit, FRED DUGGAR, snorts.  Takes his feet of the desk. \nFRED Helping? \nCHIEF NYBACK (ignoring him) Anything they need to see, you show them; anywhere they want to go, you take them. (nods to Fred) This is Detective Fred Duggar.  He's been leading the investigation up to now. \nWill puts out his hand. \nRACHEL Unsure. \nHap smiles at her.  Will checks his watch. \nWILL Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart. There should be a reservation for us. \nRachel looks at him.  Goes to a small file box on the desk. \nRACHEL (to Hap) Your friend's all business. \nWILL I'm always all business. \nHe glances out the window.  It's as bright as day. \nWILL (cont'd) Is it really 9:30? \nRACHEL (nods) Alaskan summers.  Hope you're an easy sleeper.  It'll be like this all night. \nShe hands them two cards. \nRACHEL (cont'd) Sign here. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWill's taken off his jacket and is unpacking.  The room is sparse and creaky.  Bed dips in the middle.  He hangs a jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase.  Pulls out his SMITH AND WESSON 45. \nLays it on the bedside table.  Takes out a shoulder holster. A back holster.  A handful of shells.  Lays them on the table.  Then a small SMITH AND WESSON 39/13 9MM.  Checks the magazine. \nThere's a KNOCK on the adjoining door. \nHAP (O.S.) Me. \nWill SLAPS the magazine back. \nWILL Come on in. \nHap opens the door.  A glimpse into his room: family PICTURES on his bedside table - a WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS. \nHAP See you have the same decor as my room. \nHe walks over to the big window.  It overlooks the harbor. Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance.  One lone TUGBOAT in the harbor towing a freighter. \nHAP (cont'd) Same view, too. (looks out) I've been watching that tugboat for the last half hour.  So small, pulling all that weight. (beat) We have to talk, Will. \nWill reaches into his suitcase.  Pulls out a shirt. \nWILL What do you want to talk about? \nHAP You know what about. \nWill throws him a look. \nWILL We'll talk when we get back to Seattle. \nHAP When's that, a week?  Two weeks?... (heads over to him) We have to figure out a plan of action now. \nWILL You know my plan of action. \nHAP To do nothing. \nWILL That's right. \nHAP Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  Five hours.  Asking all kinds of questions... \nWILL He's asking everybody questions. \nHAP But he's zeroing in on me.  On us. Everyone's talking about it. \nWILL He's just rattling your cage. \nHAP Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard. \nWILL We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that. \nWill goes back to his suitcase.  Hap follows.  A thin film of sweat on his upper lip. \nHAP (lowers voice) Look.  We've tampered with evidence. We've pushed witnesses.  We've planted shit.  And they're sniffing around like dogs.  Especially on the Dobbs case... \nWill flares up.  Struck a nerve.  Turns to his partner. \nWILL Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that? \nHAP You know I remember that. \nWILL One word to I.A. and he walks. \nHAP Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck... \nWILL No way. \nHAP Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing... \nWILL Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am not going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions. \nHe grabs a hanger. \nHAP Goddammit, Will.  You grab on to something and you don't let it go. \nHe takes out a handkerchief.  Wipes his brow. \nHAP I don't know if it's because you think it's the right thing to do or because your pride won't let you do anything else.  I can't tell any more. (steps back) But I can tell you one thing.  I'm getting too old for this cowboy cop stuff.  Breaking the rules.  Cleaning up messes.  We're a dying breed, Will. You're a dying breed.  I.A., the D.A., all those reporters - they don't care what you did at Leland Street seven years ago.  They don't care that you've made this your life.  They don't care about getting the bad guy... \nWill turns on his partner, eyes burning. \nWILL What time was that? \nFRED Around twelve-thirty. \nHap picks up a bear on Kay's bed.  A bell JINGLES when he shakes it.  Will crosses to a closet in the corner. \nWILL Who was the last one to see her alive? \nFRED Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything. \nWill pulls a dress out of the closet.  Small, black, elegant. The tag's been cut out.  He pulls out another, then another. Feels the fabric. \nWILL These are designer.  Expensive. (looks up) Could Randy Stetz afford these? \nFred and Ellie exchange a look. \nELLIE He fixes boat engines. \nWill looks around.  Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens. \nWILL Well her mother didn't buy them for her. \nHAP What are we thinking? \nWill reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table. Pulls out a pretty gold necklace.  Holds it up. \nWILL Kay Connell had an admirer. \nHe hands the dresses to Ellie.  Heads out of the room. \nWILL (cont'd) I want to talk to the boyfriend. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON a hand squeezing a shoulder.  Hard. \nWILL You don't seem all that sad. \nThe shoulder jerks away.  PULL BACK to reveal RANDY STETZ sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room.  Longish blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to grow a moustache. \nRANDY I haven't had a chance!  You fuckers been all over my back since Monday! \nHe takes out a cigarette.  It's bent.  He lights it.  Hap sits opposite. \nHAP You know smoking stunts your growth. \nRandy throws him a look. \nRANDY Yeah, okay, fat-ass. \nHAP (smiles at Will) More Alaskan hospitality. \nWill goes over to a coffee machine.  Pours a cup. \nWILL Did you love her? \nRANDY Huh? \nWILL Kay Connell.  Did you love her? \nRandy flicks his ash.  Shrugs. \nRANDY Sure.  She was nice. \nWill turns with his coffee. \nWILL \"She was nice.\"  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back? \nRANDY Huh? \nWILL You heard me that time. \nRANDY She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night. \nWILL But she was seeing someone else on the side. \nRandy glares. \nRANDY I don't know what you're fucking talking about. \nWILL Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about? \nRANDY Stuff. \nWILL What kind of stuff? \nRANDY Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember. \nWILL The other guy? \nRANDY I told you I don't remember. \nWILL After that she left the party to go to him. \nRANDY How should I know?... \nWILL Ran like hell to go to him... \nRANDY Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions... \nWill suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the collar.  Nose to nose. \nWILL Now you listen to me, you little shit. This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt crap may work with your mamma, but it doesn't work with me.  You got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else.  You want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is? \nWILL Where is it? \nEllie, Fred, and a couple other GUYS huddled around a desk. \nELLIE Over here. \nWill and Hap head over to them.  One of the younger guys, FARRELL, intimidated by Will's presence.  Tucks his shirt into his dirty jeans. \nThey part to reveal a BLUE KNAPSACK laying on the desk.  Mud spots all over it.  An embroidered daisy.  Will examines it. \nWILL We're sure it's hers? \nFRED Has her books in it. \nHAP What about prints? \nEllie shakes her head, unfortunately not.  Will reaches into the bag.  Pulls out two text books. \nWILL Biology and Algebra. \nHe shoves the books towards one of the guys. \nWILL (cont'd) Find out who she studied with. \nHe continues through the bag.  Pulls out a little plastic bag with \"Hello Kittys\" all over it.  Dumps out the contents. \nWILL (cont'd) Make-up. \nLooks up at Fred. \nWILL (cont'd) Find out where she bought it. \nFred looks at him.  Not happy with make-up duty.  Will pulls out a hair brush.  Hands it to Ellie. \nWILL (cont'd) Lab. \nNext, a couple worn paperbacks. \nWILL (cont'd) (reading titles) Otherwise Engaged, Murder at Sunset. \nHe looks up at the group. \nWILL (cont'd) Who here reads this kind of crap? \nFarrell straightens. \nFARRELL I read that kind of crap. \nWill tosses them to him. \nWILL Read them.  Tell me anything that strikes you. \nDown to the bottom of the bag.  A Ziploc with a half-eaten sandwich and an apple core.  Will hands them to Ellie. \nWILL (cont'd) Lab. \nUpends the knapsack.  Scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers. \nWILL (cont'd) That's it. \nFred reaches for the knapsack. \nFRED I'll stick it in the evidence locker... \nWILL No. \nWill takes it, walks slowly over to the window.  Thinking. Twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the \nTOTEM POLE standing tall outside.  A black RAVEN alights on top of it.  Pecks at the air.  Turns.  Seems to look right at Will. \nWILL (cont'd) We put it back where we found it. \nWill turns to them. \nWILL (cont'd) You said it was a fishing cabin. \nFARRELL Uh, right.  About two miles outside of town. \nELLIE On the beach. \nFred tightens his jaw. \nFRED Why are we taking it back? \nWill ignores the question.  Walks back towards them. \nWILL This murder was in the papers, right? \nELLIE Yeah.  All over. \nWILL Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet. (checks watch) We can get it in by the morning editions. \nHe hands the bag to Farrell. \nWILL (cont'd) Fill this with random books.  Make it look heavy. \nWill pulls out a handkerchief.  Wipes the mud off his hands. Taking his time.  Finally turns to Fred. \nWILL (cont'd) It'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he overlooked a detail. \nEXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING \nPOV through BINOCULARS \nWILL (cont'd) Go! \nThey rush out the door and split directions.  Will crouches down by the trap door and... \nINT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \n...drops down into a dark, dank TUNNEL.  Water dripping. FOOTFALLS echoing.  Will cocks his head.  Left or right? Starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel, his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls.  He rounds a curve.  Sound recedes... \nEXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \n...He exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach.  Stops short. \nFOG \nhas enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all sound.  Like a strange dream.  Eerie. \nWill blinks against the thick whiteness.  Strains to hear any sound, anything.  There's only the distant LAPPING of the water. \nHe tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog. Quick, careful steps.  Stumbles over a rock.  Waves his gun in defense.  Eyes wide open like a blind man... \nSUDDENLY \na GUNSHOT.  Off to the right.  Will whips his head around. \nEXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS \nEllie, alone, jumps at the sound.  Reaches for her weapon... \nEXT. DOWN THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS \nWill heads towards the sound.  Reaching out for approaching rocks.  Scrambles over a small bank and finds... \nFARRELL rolled up into a fetal position on the ground. Clutching his thigh.  Blood seeping through his fingers.  He looks up. \nFARRELL Sorry about... \nWILL Where is he? \nFarrell can't answer that. \nWILL (cont'd) (impatient) Where'd the shot come from? \nFarrell lifts his bloody hand.  Points off towards the water. \nFARRELL Over there. \nWill disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind. \nClambers back down towards the water, pausing every few seconds to listen, to adjust.  Heart POUNDING.  Blood pumping.  Like an animal tracking its prey.  Leaps up onto a plateau of rocks when... \nSUDDENLY \na DARK FIGURE \nflashes past him.  The killer!  Inches away.  Will wheels around... \nWILL Freeze! \nCRACK!  Squeezes off a shot.  Misses!  Can't believe it. Goes for another... Nothing!  Jammed!  The figure, disappearing.  Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches behind his back and whips out his SMITH 39/13... \nEXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS \nEllie, weapon drawn, making her way down the rocks.  A HAND suddenly grabs her arm. \nVOICE (O.S.) Dammit, Ellie!... \nFred emerges from the fog. \nFRED (cont'd) Put that thing away!  Farrell's down!... \nCRACK! as another shot rips through the air.  Fred and Ellie freeze. \nEXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER \nFred and Ellie, skittering down the rocks.  Getting closer to the water.  Hear a voice ring out... \nVOICE (O.S.) Hap! \nThe fog starts to dissipate.  They reach the water to see... \nWILL DORMER \nkneeling beside the body of his partner.  Lying in the water. Shot in the stomach.  Blood dribbling from his mouth.  Will grabs him up by the collar. \nWILL Hap! \nStarts shaking the limp body.  Teeth clenched. \nWILL (cont'd) Hap! \nHap's head, rolls back.  Mouth agape.  Face white... \nWill, rips off his tie.  Presses it to the gaping wound... trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the water... \nEllie watches.  Horrified.  Fred races over to the body. Feels for Hap's pulse. \nFRED Dormer... \nWill, shaking Hap again.  Jaw set.  Eyes intense.  Veins popping up along his temples.  Fred catches his shoulder. \nFRED (cont'd) Dormer!  He's gone. \nWill looks up at Fred.  His face contorts. \nHe stops chewing.  Realises the association.  Swallows uncomfortably. \nFARRELL (cont'd) Oh.  I'm sorry.  About Hap.  Detective Eckhart. \nWILL Thanks. \nFARRELL I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something. \nWILL He would have liked that. \nFARRELL We just gotta catch the bastard, right? \nWILL That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell. \nFARRELL What I saw? \nWILL Anything.  It's important. \nFarrell takes another bite of the Snickers.  Like a little boy.  Furrows his brow, trying to remember. \nFARRELL Pretty much nothing.  That fog was so thick.  The bullet seemed to come out of nowhere.  I don't even remember seeing any shapes.  Then I saw you.  But only when you came up close.  Then you disappeared again. (shrugs) I guess I heard more than I saw. \nWill sighs, rubs his eyes. \nFARRELL (cont'd) Sorry. \nWILL No.  No.  Don't be sorry.  It's not your fault. \nJust then a NURSE comes in with a Dixie cup.  Pretty, freckled face.  Not much older than Kay Connell. \nNURSE Time for your meds. \nFarrell smiles at her, winks at Will. \nFARRELL Lonnie and I went to high school together. \nLonnie gives him the cup. \nLONNIE Just take the pills, Farrell. \nWILL How's the leg? \nFARRELL Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through. \nWILL Right.  Got lost in the rocks. \nFARRELL We'll get the other one, though. \nWill looks up.  Farrell pops the rest of the Snickers in his mouth. \nFARRELL (cont'd) After the autopsy. \nINT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - LATER \nWill walks down the hallway.  Light pouring in from a set of high windows.  He looks tired.  Set-upon. \nPOV of SOMEONE \nWATCHING HIM.  From a doorway.  Not close, not far.  A HAND comes into view.  Small.  Bruised knuckles.  Holds on to the door jamb.  Watches as... \nWill suddenly stops.  Skin prickling at the back of his neck. Turns and looks around. \nA MAN in a wheelchair. \nA LITTLE GIRL tugging at her hospital gown. \nA couple of NURSES laughing at check-in. \nAn empty doorway. \nNothing. \nEXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING \nBack at the beach.  We see nothing but fog.  A VOICE comes through. \nELLIE (O.S.) ...and it was at this point that Detective Dormer headed towards the noise... \nEllie emerges from the fog.  Carrying the map and talking into a small tape recorder.  She's climbing over the rocks, wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big. \nA UNIFORMED OFFICER follows, carrying a camera.  She turns to him. \nELLIE (cont'd) Remember, Kepp, shoot everything... (back to the tape recorder) ...wherein he discovered the wounded Detective Farrell Brooks, having been shot in the vastus externus of the upper left thigh... \nShe climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two evenings before.  Finds... \nANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER, hanging out and smoking. \nELLIE (cont'd) Francis! \nHe looks up.  Pimples on his chin. \nFRANCIS What? \nELLIE You're supposed to be Farrell.  Shot in the thigh and writhing in pain. \nFRANCIS C'mon, Ellie.  What's it matter? \nELLIE Accuracy.  That's what. (points to the ground) Now get down. \nFrancis looks up at her.  Flicks his cigarette away and gets down amongst the rocks.  Holds his thigh like he was shot. \nFRANCIS Ow. \nRACHEL I got it. (smiles) Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years. \nWILL Habit. \nRachel looks at him.  Can't figure this guy out.  Remembers something. \nRACHEL (cont'd) Oh.  A man came by to see you earlier. Said he was your new partner. \nA TINGLE skips down Will's spine.  He looks at her. \nWILL Fred Duggar? \nRACHEL No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him. \nWILL I'm not expecting anyone. \nRACHEL That's not what he thinks. \nWILL What did he look like? \nRachel thinks for a second.  Leaning against the clock. \nRACHEL Short.  Dark hair.  Not that memorable. \nWill nods, rubs his forehead.  Suddenly has a pounding headache.  Turns for the stairs.  Hesitates. \nWILL I need to borrow something. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON a nail.  One THWACK of a hammer and it bites into the wall.  PULL BACK to reveal Will nailing the corner of a blanket to one side of the window.  An ad hoc curtain. \nHe finishes that side.  Starts to stretch the blanket across the window.  Hesitates.  Looks outside.  To the left.  To the right.  To see if anybody's out there.  If anybody's watching.  Sees instead... \nA LONE TUGBOAT chugging across the harbor.  Pulling a huge freighter.  Will squeezes his eyes shut.  Opens them again. Pulls the blanket fully across the window. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - 1:05 A.M. \nThe FILES spread across the floor.  Their edges buckled from the rain.  Dozens of pictures of Kay Connell.  School records.  Private letters.  Health files.  Coroner's report. \nWill.  Pacing.  Back and forth.  Thinking.  Over that same SQUEAKY floorboard.  The clock reads: 1:05. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - 2:20 A.M. \nWill lying in bed.  On top of the blanket.  Wide awake. Staring at the ADJOINING DOOR.  Into Hap's room. \nEXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT \nWill, in a sweatshirt and coat, heads down the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge.  Jams his hands in his pockets.  The walk of an insomniac. \nEXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT \nWill walking down main street.  In the middle of the road. The dead of night.  No cars.  The sky a blinding white. \nHears some rowdy NOISE coming from a corner bar, beer lights flickering.  A WOMAN rides by on a bicycle.  Birds SINGING. \nNot day.  Not night.  Stuck somewhere in between.  Like a dream. \nTurns down a side street.  Passing more stores.  Guns and Ammo.  Patty's Hair and Nails.  General Store.  Comes upon \nTHE ALLEY \nwhere he vomited the day before.  Stops.  Sees the DEAD DOG, still down at the end.  Half obscured by the dumpster. \nWill wavers, pale.  Suddenly... \nA HOMELESS MAN emerges from the shadows.  Big.  Wild-eyed. Awakened from his sleep.  Will, quickly backtracks to the sidewalk.  Spooked. \nJUST THEN the CRACK! of bat hitting ball.  He turns.  In the distance.  Nightmute Elementary School. \nEXT. NIGHTMUTE ELEMENTARY - LATE NIGHT \nA Little League game in full swing.  The uniforms, a little faded.  The diamond, a little unkempt.  A smattering of SPECTATORS.  Mostly dads with six-packs. \nWill wanders over to the fence.  Spots Ellie sitting alone on the bottom bleacher. \nCUT TO: \nPOV OF SOMEONE \nWATCHING HIM.  From afar.  The SOUNDS of the game, delayed a few seconds.  Watches as Will crosses to the bleachers... \nCUT BACK TO: \n...and sits down next to Ellie.  She turns, surprised. \nELLIE (cont'd) Detective Dormer!  What are you doing here? (looks at watch) It's two-thirty in the morning. Shouldn't you be asleep? \nWill glances out at the game. \nWILL I could say the same thing about you. \nELLIE Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time. \nWILL Who's playing? \nELLIE The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year. \nShe sips on a take-out coke.  Looks back at the game.  A plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat.  Blows a bubble. \nELLIE That's my sister. \nWill looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss by a mile.  Ellie cups her hands around her mouth. \nCORONER You're looking a little green, Detective. \nINT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY \nFred Duggar, dialing the phone at his cluttered desk. \nWILL (O.S.) So where's the other bullets? \nHe looks up.  Will standing before him, holding the manila envelope. \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY \nCLOSE on a key slipping into a padlock.  Opens with a CLICK! \nPULL BACK to reveal Fred and Will in a small storage room. Standing in front of an army-green LOCKER.  The evidence locker.  Room's stuffed with old files and boxes.  MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over a small window.  Will glances up. \nWILL What's with all the moose antlers around here? \nFred throws a look over his shoulder.  Opens the locker. \nFRED Lots of moose. \nINSIDE THE LOCKER - another manila envelope.  The name on this one: Farrell Brooks. \nFred reaches back for the other envelope.  Will, hesitant to give it to him.  Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom corner.  Hands it over.  Wipes his brow. \nWILL When's Rich coming? \nFred slides it in beside Farrell's.  Closes the locker door. \nFRED I'll call him now. \nWILL First I need a copy of the key. \nFred turns, a twinkle in his eye. \nFRED This isn't Seattle, Detective.  We don't have copies. (holds up key) This is the only one. \nWill looks at him.  At the key.  Plucks it from his hand. Just then Nyback's SECRETARY appears in the doorway. \nSECRETARY Detective Dormer?  Telephone. \nINT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY \nThe secretary hands Will the phone.  Pulls something from under the desk.  A beat-up BOX.  Will's name on it. \nSECRETARY This came for you earlier. \nWill glances at it.  Takes the phone.  Rubs his eyes. \nWILL (into phone) Dormer. \nNothing.  Someone's there but they're not saying anything. Will, too tired for this shit... \nWILL (cont'd) Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna check up on me every... \nThen...the VOICE.  A MAN's voice.  Not John Warfield's. This voice is medium-ranged.  Higher.  Nose sounds stuffed. \nMAN'S VOICE I bet you haven't been getting much sleep. \nWill straightens.  Something weird. \nWILL (into phone) What? \nA little TITTER on the other end. \nMAN'S VOICE You lower-48s.  You think the white nights are kind of neat.  Then you can't sleep for days.  I've seen it happen about a million times.  But you can't sleep for a different reason. \nWILL (into phone) Who is this? \nA PAUSE.  Will loosens his tie. \nWILL (into phone) I said, who is this? \nThe voice.  Dropping to a WHISPER. \nMAN'S VOICE I saw what really happened, Will... \nWill, furrows his brow. \nMAN'S VOICE I saw you kill your partner.  With your back-up weapon.  Out there on the beach. I saw you shoot him dead... \nCLOSE ON \nWill Dormer's face. \nAs all the blood drains from it. \nAs all SOUND \nfades around him. \nAs his heart \nbegins to POUND against his chest. \nHe falters, reaching out for the desk.  To steady himself. As if the floor's just dropped out beneath him.  Eyes, darting around the bullpen... \nWILL (sotto, into phone) Now you listen to me... \nMAN'S VOICE Don't worry.  I won't tell anyone.  Oh, and I saw you take my gun.  My uncle's old 357.  I dropped it in the rocks. But you can go ahead and keep that. \nCHIEF NYBACK, exits his office.  Looks at Will and smiles. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY \n...steps into the HALLWAY leading towards the bullpen.  Hears VOICES.  Nearby.  Ducks back.  Waiting for them to fade. \nSafe.  Heads down towards the STORAGE ROOM.  Glancing briefly at the PICTURES hanging on the wall.  Of old time POLICE OFFICERS.  Striking brave poses... \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY \nThe storage room.  Hot.  Stifling.  The moose antlers LOOMING over his shoulder.  Will pulls the evidence locker key from his pocket.  Unlocks the padlock.  Swings the door open. \nPulls the Hap Eckhart envelope out.  Throwing a look over his shoulder.  Opens it.  Shakes out the bullet that was lodged in Hap's spine.  Then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket. The bullet he shot into the dead dog.  Drops that into the envelope and reseals it.  Hands shaking. \nSomething.  Catches the corner of his eye.  He turns. \nHIS REFLECTION in the locker mirror.  The blood smear still on his forehead. \nFRED (O.S.) Dormer... \nWill jumps.  Quickly wipes the smear off and turns.  Fred Duggar standing behind him.  RICH by his side.  Will clears his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand.  Then Farrell's.  Angry. \nWILL These should have gone out two hours ago. \nSLAMS the locker door and brushes past him.  Fred and Rich exchange a glance. \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY \nCLOSE ON a YOUNG GIRL's face.  Dark hair held up in two barrettes, wind tousling the curls.  Reading from a piece of paper. \nYOUNG GIRL ...And that's how I think Kay would want us to remember her... \nPULL BACK to reveal Kay Connell's funeral.  PEOPLE standing by the grave, most of them HIGH SCHOOLERS.  The sky's a brilliant blue.  Red fireweeds blanket the hillside. \nYOUNG GIRL (cont'd) ...Swimming, reading, hiking through the Kebaughs... \nFRED, ELLIE AND WILL \nstand off to the side.  Dressed in black.  Fred looks like he's never worn a tie before.  Ellie holds a potted plant.  A gift for the bereaved. \nYOUNG GIRL (cont'd) ...playing her flute, meeting at Darrow's after school... \nWill.  Eyes bloodshot.  Not really listening.  Not really paying attention.  A thousand miles away.  Tugs at his collar.  Feels tight. \nYOUNG GIRL ...And always, always with a smile on her face. \nThe young girl looks up.  Folds the paper closed.  People SNIFFLE.  Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm. \nSome CHILDREN.  Start circulating with plastic buckets. Filled with white carnations.  Handing them out. \nVOICE (O.S.) Want one? \nWill, startled, looks down.  A LITTLE GIRL stands before him. Curly hair.  Glasses.  Holding up a bucket.  He shakes his head.  Looks back up at \nTHE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's casket. \nAN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane.  Two GIRLS, look like sisters, holding each other up.  A MAN with a thick red beard.  A LITTLE BOY, about five, clutching a FLUTE tied with a pink ribbon... \nWill, looks away.  Then.  At the end of the line.  Something catches his eye. \nRANDY STETZ \nin tight jeans and a down vest.  In front of him stands a GIRL with white-blonde hair. \nFrom the torn pictures in Kay Connell's room. \nWill, straightens at the sight of her. \nSees Randy surreptitiously caress her ass. \nEXT. CEMETERY - LATER \nThe service is over.  People are heading back to their cars. Fred yanks off his tie.  Looks at Ellie. \nFRED We should go say hello to Mrs. Connell. \nHe starts off.  Ellie, looks back at Will. \nWILL You go ahead.  I'll be there in a second. \nEllie nods.  Catches up to Fred.  Will turns his attention back to RANDY AND THE GIRL.  Over at the far end of the cemetery.  Standing next to Randy's motorcycle. \nEXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST - MINUTES LATER \nRandy gets on his bike, strapping his helmet on.  The girl's about to get on behind him. \nWILL (O.S.) Why don't I give her a ride? \nThey look over.  WILL walking towards them.  The wind whipping his jacket.  His tie.  Randy makes a face. \nRANDY Thought I smelled something. \nWILL Good to see you, too, Randy. \nWill arrives at the bike.  The girl, TANYA FRANCKE, looks at him curiously.  Her long white-blonde hair, her skin almost translucent.  Something sexy about her.  Has the carnation stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket. \nTANYA Who're you? \nEXT. GRAVESITE - CONTINUOUS \nFred shakes Mrs. Connell's hand.  Ellie waits.  Looks over and sees \nWILL standing with Tanya and Randy. \nShifts the plant in her hands. \nWALTER I figured we're partners on this one.  I mean, after what I saw... \nWill stops short.  Eyes burning.  It's all he can do not to throttle this weed. \nWILL Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.  We are partners on nothing. \nWalter looks at him.  Scratches his head. \nWALTER I research my novels.  I know the procedures.  You'd have cuffed me back at the ferry.  You'd have called for back- up, read me my rights, and gotten a search warrant for my apartment.  You're a well-respected detective.  There's no reason for you to be talking to me right now... \nHe takes out a handkerchief.  Blows his nose. \nWALTER (cont'd) ...except that we could help each other. \nWill stares at him. \nWALTER (cont'd) So.  We're at an impasse. \nWill runs his hands through his hair.  Half-crazed.  Heart pounding.  Turns to watch... \nTHE KIDS down the glacier.  Making angels in the snow.  Their GIGGLES carried along by the wind. \nWill, squeezes his eyes shut.  Trapped.  About to defy every instinct in his body. \nWILL (sotto) You're going to get a phone call. \nWalter steps up, tapping his hearing aid. \nWALTER I'm sorry? \nWILL I said you're going to get a phone call. \nWALTER (perks up) Oh? \nWILL Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books. \nWALTER Thought you might find that. \nWILL You're going to be brought in for questioning. \nWalter smiles.  Pleased. \nWALTER Down at the station? \nWILL (hisses) Yes down at the station. \nWalter rubs his hands together.  Thinking. \nWALTER Okay.  Okay.  Brought in for questioning. Good.  I can write this. \nJUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN.  Low and loud.  Walter looks down at it. \nWALTER (cont'd) Ferry's leaving. \nHe starts down.  Will watches him pass, has no choice but to follow.  Walter, going over the details in his head. \nWALTER (cont'd) Something to divert... \nSnaps his fingers.  An idea. \nWALTER (cont'd) My gun.  You still have my gun, right? \nWill nods.  Walter smiles.  Spreads out his hands. \nWALTER (cont'd) Then that's the wild card.  Every detective story has a wild card. \nWILL What do you mean, \"wild card?\" \nTOURISTS.  Boarding the ferry. \nWALTER Next ferry's in forty-five minutes. \nWalter heads over to the ramp.  Will stops, grabbing his side.  A PANG through his ribs.  Excruciating.  Calls out to Walter. \nWILL What do you mean \"wild card?\" \nWalter looks back.  Waves. \nWALTER You'll know.  At the questioning. \nGives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER.  Gets on.  Walks back to the stern.  Looks out at Will.  The HORN sounds again. \nWalter, at the rail.  Smiles.  The ferry's engine, churning up water.  Starting forward just as... \nWalter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket.  Holds it up for Will to see. \nWill, on shore, sees it.  A cold flash ripping through his body.  That motherfucker.  Bolts through some tourists towards the ramp but... \nA couple of GUYS are just pulling it in.  The Ticket Taker, grabs his arm. \nTICKET TAKER (to Will) Full up. \nWill, jerks his arm away.  Stares off at the ferry.  Walter Byrd and his tape recorder.  Receding into the distance. \nINT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY \nCLOSE ON a counter top.  Stuff thrown down.  Aspirin.  Band- aids.  Gauze.  Medical tape.  First aid cream.  Back pills. Sleeping pills.  Bottle of scotch. \nPULL BACK to reveal Will standing at the counter in the convenience store.  His entire body aching.  The CASHIER, throws him a look. \nWILL I have a cold. \nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MINUTES LATER \nA DARK FIGURE.  Appears ahead.  Big and hulking...CRASHING towards us... \nWe raise our weapon...quick as a flash...as the FIGURE emerges... \nAnd in a split second... \nWE LOCK EYES WITH FIGURE's - his eyes, brown and gentle... \nCRACK!  We fire!  The FIGURE grips his gut, falls into the water. \nHeart POUNDING.  Adrenaline PUMPING.  We slosh towards the body.  Something...catching our eye... \nA 357 RUGER \nlying in the rocks.  Off to the side.  We grab it.  Turn back to the body... \nAnd stop cold. \nThat's when it hits us.  That's when we realize... \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT \nWill bolts up.  White as a sheet. \nWILL I didn't know! \nHis body, drenched in sweat.  His breathing, quick and ragged.  Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed.  Looks across the room and sees \nHAP \nsitting in the corner.  Eating an apple with a penknife. \nHAP You sure about that, buddy? \nHe smiles.  Sympathetic.  Looks over at the window just as... \nThe BLANKET.  Drops to the floor. \nLIGHT floods the room. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:02 A.M. \nWith a GRUNT Will puts his back into it.  Shoving the heavy oak bureau towards the window.  Sweat beading his face. \nA...few...more...shoves.  And the bureau finally stands in front of the window.  WIll stands back to take a look.  Only covers half of it. \nWILL Fuck! \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M. \nRed-faced, Will leans into the wooden armoire.  Shimmying it towards the window... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT \nEllie.  Sitting in her truck.  Parked behind the Pioneer Lodge.  Rubbbing her eyes.  Sleepy.  Looking up at \nWILL'S WINDOW \nconcerned. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT.

WILL'S ROOM - 4:50 A.M. \nWill shoving magazines, blankets, sheets, pillows.  Anything. To fill the cracks.  To cover the light.  His eyes.  Like a crazy man's... \nSUDDENLY a knock on the door.  Will turns. \nRACHEL (O.S.) Detective Dormer? \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nRachel standing out in the hallway.  Will opens the door. \nRACHEL (startled by his appearance) Will...I... \nWILL What is it? \nRACHEL There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise. (beat) Says he can't sleep. \nWill gives a half-smile.  Fucking irony.  Heads back into... \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \n...his room.  Rachel follows.  Looks around at the mess. \nRACHEL Are you alright? \nWill grabs up a sweater. \nWILL I'm fine. \nHe heads back over to the window.  Rachel now notices all the stuff piled up.  Softens her voice. \nRACHEL Did something happen? \nWill.  Cramming the sweater into a crack. \nELLIE When did you first meet her? \nFred shoots Ellie a look.  She closes her mouth. \nWALTER A year ago.  At one of my signings. \nEllie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged.  He holds it up.  Opened to the signature. \nFRED Where you signed this? \nWALTER That's right. \nFRED What happened at that signing? \nWALTER She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books. \nFRED Did she? \nWALTER Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week... \nWill, from over by the window.  Interrupts. \nWILL What was the nature of your relationship? \nWalter looks over.  Wide-eyed. \nWALTER What do you mean, Detective Dormer? \nWill turns.  Accusatory. \nWILL She was an attractive girl.  Did you have sex with her? \nWalter blinks. \nWALTER She was only seventeen. \nWILL But she was an attractive girl. \nWALTER I suppose. \nWILL Did you have sex with her? \nFred shoots Will a look.  Ellie, watching him. \nWALTER No. \nWILL But you wanted to. \nWALTER I was a mentor to her. \nWill heads over to Walter's chair.  Fists clenched in his pockets. \nWILL You gave her gifts. \nWALTER Yes. \nWILL Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace. \nWALTER Yes. \nWILL Doesn't sound like a mentor to me. \nWALTER I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have. \nHe turns to Fred and Ellie. \nWALTER (cont'd) Her family lives on Mr. Connell's disability.  It isn't much. \nFred stops Will with a look.  Had enough. \nFRED We understand, Mr. Byrd. (to Will) You want to sit down, Detective? \nTense BEAT.  Will stares at Walter.  Revulsion.  Heads back over to the window. \nWALTER She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to. \nFRED How do you mean? \nWALTER That boyfriend.  Randy. \nFred, sits up. \nFRED Randy Stetz? \nWALTER That's right. \nWILL What about him? \nWALTER He.  Well, he... \nWalter hesitates.  Takes a sip of coffee. \nWALTER (cont'd) I don't want to talk out of school.  Kay told me things in the strictest of confidence.  As a friend. \nFRED Mr. Byrd.  Anything you can tell us could help out with this case. \nWalter furrows his brow.  Taps his hearing aid. \nWALTER Well.  He hit her. \nEllie's eyes widen.  Fred glances at Will.  But Will's too busy watching this little man weave his web. \nFRED Are you sure about that? \nFRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the doorway.  Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  Screams. \nRANDY (cont'd) That ain't mine! \nFred grabs Randy's shoulder. \nFRED C'mon, Randy. \nRandy squirms.  Turns.  Looks right into Will's eyes.  Gone is the bluster.  Gone is the attitude.  Randy Stetz, lost kid.  Tears streaming down his face. \nRANDY I swear to God.  I didn't kill her.  I swear to God... \nEXT. GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY \nWill stands outside the garage apartment.  Wind whipping his coat.  Watches as a Nightmute PD SQUAD CAR pulls off with Randy Stetz in the back. \nFred sees him, heads over. \nFRED You look like shit, cowboy. \nWill shifts his eyes to him. \nWILL That's an understatement. \nFred half-smiles.  Watches the receding squad car. \nFRED Looks like we can wrap this one up. \nWill barely nods.  Fred pulls his baseball cap on. \nFRED (cont'd) We're getting together for a couple of beers later on.  Might not be the Seattle thing to do.  But you're welcome to come. \nFred puts out his hand to shake.  Truce.  Will looks at him. Takes it. \nINT.

Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN. \nRich takes a glass from Fred. \nRICH What do you mean, you can't believe it? \nFRANCIS He was an asshole. \nFARRELL That doesn't mean anything. \nFred sits.  Takes a sip of his beer.  To Farrell. \nFRED Didn't you grow up with him? \nFarrell shifts in his seat. \nFARRELL Our dads were on the same boat. (to Will) We used to wait for them together. \nWill nods.  Jostled by the crowd.  Reaches for his beer. \nFRANCIS He used to pick fights at the gas station. \nRICH And remember when he did all those donut holes that one summer? \nHe and Francis GUFFAW. \nFRED Just a bad seed. \nFarrell looks over at Will. \nFARRELL How do you like our beer? \nWill slams down his empty glass.  Squeezes his eyes open and shut.  Loud music.  Cigarette smoke. \nWILL I like it fine. \nFred pats Will's shoulder. \nFRED What Detective Dormer needs is a little shut-eye. \nRICH The white nights been hard on you? \nWILL They haven't been easy. \nFrancis grabs a handful of peanuts. \nFRANCIS They don't have titanium shades over at the Pioneer. \nRICH Well no wonder. \nFRANCIS You lose all sense of time. \nFARRELL Better than Fred's home town. \nWill turns to Fred.  Wiping the foam from his moustache. \nFRED My people are from Barrow.  Way up north. \nRICH In the winter there's no sunlight for five straight months. \nFRED Like being swallowed up in a black hole. \nJUST THEN. \nWILL approaches the monument.  Sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled coat.  Face drawn and haggard.  Angry. \nWALTER (smiles) Hi, Will... \nWill enters the monument. \nWILL What the hell are you doing calling me at the station? \nA gust of wind WHORLS through the monument. \nWALTER I figured we should touch base.  Compare notes.  I think it went well.  What did you think? \nWill's eyes pierce into him. \nWILL Randy Stetz is in jail. \nWALTER Told you I could write an ending. \nWILL Congratulations. \nWill holds out his hand. \nWILL (cont'd) The tape. \nWalter looks at the open hand.  Hugs his jacket to him. \nWALTER I thought maybe we could talk some more. \nWILL There's nothing more to talk about. \nWALTER But we work so well together... \nWill breaks.  Rushes Walter.  Slams him against one of the concrete pilasters. \nWILL We do nothing well together. (SLAMS him again) Nothing!  You understand me? \nAnother wave CRASHES.  Sprays them.  Walter looks up into Will's bloodshot eyes. \nWALTER You run on two settings, Will.  I've noticed that... \nWill tightens his grip. \nWALTER (cont'd) You jump from calm to rage in the blink of an eye.  That's okay.  I do that too. \nHe holds up the tape.  Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the side.  Yanks the tape out of the cassette.  Steps back and HURLS it into the sea.  Waves engulf it hungrily. \nWalter watches him. \nWALTER (cont'd) You're not sleeping, are you? \nWILL What the hell do you know? \nWALTER Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me. \nPAUSE. \nWALTER (cont'd) Does Detective Eckhart come to you? \nWill curls his fists. \nWALTER (cont'd) Does he ask you why you shot him? \nWhips around... \nWILL I told you that was an accident! \nWALTER Then so was mine... \nWILL Don't you pull that shit with me. \nWALTER I didn't want to kill her, Will. \nSteps closer to him.  Beseeching. \nWALTER (cont'd) When she called me that night from the party, she'd had a fight with Randy. Wanted to talk.  I told her to meet me at our special place.  The cabin at the beach... \nA couple RAVENS alight nearby.  Flapping their wings. SCREECHING into the wind. \nWALTER (cont'd) ...When she came she was barefoot.  And there was liquor on her breath.  I only wanted to comfort her.  To touch her. She could have at least let me do that. Her skin...it was like everything I'd ever written about. \nA dark shadow crosses his face.  Holds on to the coiled rope of the statue.  Will hisses. \nWILL Couldn't get it up, Walter? \nWALTER It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all. \nWalter.  Squeezing the bronze rope. \nWALTER (cont'd) From calm to rage in the blink of an eye. \nLocks eyes with Will.  Conspiratorial. \nWALTER (cont'd) Remember? \nWILL'S HAND shoots out.  Clamps around Walter's neck. \nWILL Like this? \nWalter's face, starts turning red. \nWALTER Yes.  Like that. \nWILL This an accident, Walter? \nShe and Will lock eyes.  Hold for a beat. \nHe knows exactly what she was trying to do. \nINT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY \nWill, driving down Nightmute's main street.  He takes a left. Goes up a hill.  Glances out the window.  Passing by \nTHE CEMETERY.  A cluster of headstones.

Hair's combed.  Put on a clean suit.  Steps back.  Smooths down his lapels.  Just right. \nTurns to face the room.  Bed's made, mess cleaned up.  He heads over to the bureau, pulls out his Smith 39/13.  Lays it on the bed. \nUnclips his badge from his belt.  Lays it on the bed.  Takes something from the bedside table.  The BULLET found in Hap Eckhart.  Lays it on the bed. \nAll neat.  All ordered. \nReaches under the mattress.  Pulls out the PHOTOGRAPH of a blurry Walter Byrd standing in front of a house.  A radio tower in the background.  The call numbers: WKOZ. \nWill studies it.  Tears it in half. \nINT. BACK ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING \nRachel in the back room behind reception.

JEEP CHEROKEE - LAKE KGUN \nWill stops the car at the end of a narrow dirt driveway. Looming before him... \nA HOUSE right on the lake.  Tall, wooden, in disrepair. Chipping yellow paint.  A ghost of what it once was.  The house from the photograph. \nINT. STUDY - HOUSE \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nWill, on his feet, trying to focus.  His suit, soaked with blood.  Looking for his gun.  Spots it, in the corner... \nINT. LIBRARY \nWalter jerks open another drawer.  A STACK OF BOOKS teeter on the top of the cabinet.  He finds what he needs.  SHELLS. Grabs a handful... \nTHE BOOKS tumble down on top of him.  He CRIES out, covering his head...touches his ear, panics - hearing aid's gone! Looks up.  Will, coming down the hall... \nINT.

Finger on the trigger... \nSLO-MO...The FIGURE, passing.  Her heart, POUNDING.  Her finger...squeezing... \nWill Dormer or Walter Byrd? \nAt the last second, she jerks the gun away.  The figure disappears.  She swallows.  Gripping the gun.  Follows. \nEXT. BACK YARD - SUMMER HOUSE \nThe sky, heavy with clouds.  The air, foreboding.  Will steals out the screen door.  Gun cocked.

He sees it. \nLucy and Desi.  Down by the boathouse. \nINT. BOATHOUSE \nThe boathouse.  Old, rotted wood.  Crumbling beams. \nWalter stands at a window.  Re-loading his shotgun.  He fumbles, drops a shell.  It rolls towards a crack in the floor.  Falls into the LAKE WATER below. \nCLICK!  Walter levels the shotgun out the window. \nWALTER'S POV - the long, undulating WEEDS outside. \nEXT. WEEDS \nWill.  Pulling himself through the weeds.  Losing blood fast. Dragging his body.  Approaches the side of the BOATHOUSE. \nWALTER'S GUN BARREL, sticking out. \nWill ducks his head.  Winces in pain.  Breathing, becoming ragged.  Rounds to the other side.  Hoists himself up to another WINDOW.  Cautiously looks in... \nWALTER at the far window. \nWill jerks back.  Steps on the dock.  A plank CREAKS.  Shit. Peers back through the window. \nWALTER.  Still looking out.  Didn't hear a thing. \nWill remembers.  Walter doesn't have his hearing aid.  He's deaf on that side. \nINT. BOATHOUSE \nWalter, looking out the window. \nOVER HIS SHOULDER - we see Will climbing in through the window.  Smearing blood along the sill, favoring his leg. Stands straight.

Comes face to face with the barrel of Will Dormer's gun.  Surprised.  Absently touches his deaf ear. \n", "test1_input": "It clicks off abruptly.  Rachel appears in the doorway. Takes in the blood on Will's shirt. \nRACHEL I'm sorry about your partner. \nWill looks at her.  She walks over to the desk. \nRACHEL (cont'd) It's been on the radio for the last two hours.  Nothing but that.  Like when they found Kay Connell's body. (sympathetic smile) We're not used to this sort of thing up here. \nShe reaches for his key. \nRACHEL (cont'd) He was standing right there just a couple of days ago.  Your partner.  Exactly where you are now. (beat) I hope I was nice to him. \nWill takes his key. \nWILL You were nice to him.  He liked you. \nHe smiles faintly, turns to go.  Just then the phone RINGS. \nRACHEL (answering) Pioneer Lodge?... (listens) Hold on a second.  He's right here. \nWill stops.  Turns.  Rachel holds up the phone.  Covering the mouthpiece. \nRACHEL (cont'd) John Warfield.  He's called a couple of times. \nWill's stomach drops.  That's the last phone call in the world he wants to take.  Rachel reads his face. \nRACHEL (cont'd) Want me to lie? \nWill shakes his head.  Steps back and takes the phone. Clears his throat. \nWILL (into phone) Dormer. \nPAUSE.  A bemused VOICE on the other end. \nWARFIELD'S VOICE Detective Dormer.  I've been trying to reach you.  I was very sorry to hear about your partner, Detective Eckhart. It must have been a terrible shock, what happened this morning. \nWill.  Not giving this asshole an inch.  Rachel, trying not to listen. \nWILL (into phone) That's not exactly how I'd put it. \nWARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd) No, no.  I suppose not.  But I look forward to reading the report.  Very sad.  Very sad.  Funny... \nWILL (into phone) What do you mean, \"Funny?\" \nWARFIELD'S VOICE Oh, nothing.  Just that I felt Detective Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting to make a real connection before you left.  I sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest.  Did you sense anything like that, Detective?  I mean, as his partner?... \nWill, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist. \nWARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd) ...You were his partner for, what, about ten years?... \nWill turns from Rachel.  Eyes burning.  Voice steady. \nWILL (into phone) You know why everyone hates you, Warfield?  It's not your questions, it's not your press conferences, it's not even your cheap suits; everyone hates you 'cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to become one yourself.  Well I got to tell you, it's a shame you're not up here with me because I'd love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable of.  You just remember that when you're sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner! \nSLAM!  He hangs up the phone.  Runs his hand through his hair.

The sound that woke him: the window shade FLAPPING open.  LIGHT floods the room. \nWill gets up.  Goes over to the shade and pulls it down.  It lurches up halfway.  He tugs it down again.  It slaps all the way open.  Will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window. \nWILL Goddammit! \nHe gets tangled in it. \nWILL (cont'd) Goddamned...thing! \nPulls it off and flings it in the corner. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:22 A.M. \nThe digital clock flips to a new minute:  4:23.  Will, pacing.  Scratching at his stubble.  Unable to sleep.  Keeps stepping on a SQUEAKY floorboard. \nSlows near the ADJOINING DOOR that leads into Hap's room. Hovers.  Lightly pushes the door open.  Sees... \nTHE PICTURES on the bedside table.  A WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS.  Hap's family. \nINT. BATHROOM - 5:18 A.M. \nWater gushing out of the faucet.  Will's WATCH sitting on the sink's edge.  5:18. \nWill reaches up into the open medicine cabinet for a bottle of aspirin.  Shakes out a couple.

Lifts her small KIDS into the cab of a 4x4.  Watches him pass. \nAN OLDER MAN fixing the broken \"E\" on his store front.  Turns at the sound of Will's footfall. \nEveryone edgy.  Cautious.  A murderer amongst them. \nWill continues on.  Looking straight ahead.  Wipes the sweat from his neck.  Slows to a stop just outside the... \nLOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE \nA blown-up picture of KAY CONNELL in the window.  Below, a painted sign:  We miss you, Kay. \nA stack of newspapers by the front door.  The \"Nightmute Ledger.\"  The headline:  Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect. \nWill picks one up.  Stares down at it.

Everyone's there except Farrell. \nCHIEF NYBACK ...Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in thirty-seven years, and even though Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he was as good as one of us on this case.  I had the honor of working with him down in Seattle for a number of years.  He was a fine detective and an even better man. \nWill stands nearby, watching the rain hit the windows.  His suit pants are slightly wrinkled.  Nyback nods towards Fred. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Fred, you'll be working with Detective Dormer directly from now on. \nFred, stroking his moustache, nods.  Nyback turns to Will. \nCHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Will?  Anything you'd like to add? \nWill looks up.  Everyone's eyes turn to him.  He shakes his head. \nCHIEF NYBACK Okay.  Then let's get to it. \nFeet shuffling.  Chairs scraping the floor as people get up. A sense of determination in the air.  Will grabs his coat. \nELLIE (O.S.) Detective Dormer? \nHe turns.  Ellie is beside him, holding a map. \nELLIE (cont'd) I'm sorry to bother you, but I was asked to write the report on... (lowers eyes) ...you know what I was asked to write the report on... (looks back up) ...Could you, just to be accurate, for the report, could you just point out where you were when you saw Detective Eckhart yesterday? \nShe holds out the map.  It's of the small stretch of coastline.  Red circles marking various points. \nWill looks down at her.  Takes the map.  Turns it around. \nWILL It's good to be accurate, Ellie.  You're doing your job. \nHe looks down at the map.  Ellie watching his face. \nELLIE I'm so sorry about what happened.  I know you did everything you could... \nWill points to a spot.  Cutting her off. \nWILL I was here. \nHands her back the map.  Smiles.  Just then Fred walks up. \nFRED Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell. \nWILL I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now. (looks at his watch) You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time. \nHe pulls on his coat and heads for the door.  Fred watches him leave.

Farrell puts down the book.  Picks up the Snickers. \nFARRELL (cont'd) You don't seem like the bring-an- underling-who's-in-the-hospital-a- Snickers-bar kind of guy. \nWILL I'm not. \nHe pulls up a chair.

Jerks it up.  She CRIES out.  Will leans in. \nWILL (cont'd) You like games, little girl?  Well how about this one - you're standing right where her naked body was found wrapped up in a garbage bag. \nTanya's eyes grow wide.  She looks around her.  Disgusting, rotten.

Avoides eye-contact with a YOUNG WOMAN shelving \"New Arrivals!\" \nReaches into the bin.  Rummages through some paperbacks. Then he finds it:  Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd. Underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for: Another J. Brody Mystery.  Flips to the inside of the cover. \nA BLURRY PICTURE of Walter Byrd.  Head turned to the side.

Trot over to him.  Wolf down the treats. Will scans the place.  Small, cheap.  Matching sofa and easy chair, corduroy upholstery.  The walls, lined with old 1950s movie posters.  All second-rate detective movies:  \"Another Shot in the Dark,\" \"Lady Luck,\" \"He wore a Black Hat.\" \nWill walks across the room.  Repulsed.  The pathetic hovel of a killer.  Looks into the \nBEDROOM \nSingle bed.  Books and magazines.  A half-eaten tuna sandwich on the bedside table.  \"NYPD BLUE\" calendar on the wall. \nIt's quiet.  He walks over to a large DESK by the window. Scattered papers.  Computer.  Mini cassette recorder. \nOn the wall, hundreds of newspaper articles.  Some yellowing, some fresh.  All about cops: \"Officer Louis Saved My Life!\" \"Shoot-out in Soho,\" \"South Street Cop Takes Down Drug Ring,\" \"Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect...\" \nWill curls his lip.  Starts looking through the papers on the desk.  Underneath a stack, he finds an 8x10 PHOTOGRAPH.  It's of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside HOUSE.  A RADIO TOWER in the background.  Walter Byrd's face is blurred, turned to the side.  The photo from the book bio. \nWill takes it.  Starts roughly opening drawers.  A box of animal crackers, a rubber band ball.  Then, shoved in the back of the top drawer, an APPOINTMENT BOOK.  Will flips through to today's date.  Blank.  Shoves the book into his pocket.  Slams the door closed. \nThen reaches back for his Smith 39/13.  Checks the magazine. Slaps it back in place.  He's ready. \nSUDDENLY the phone RINGS.  A beige rotary on the desk.

His hair, no longer neatly combed.  His face, pale and unshaven.  His eyes, dragged open from fatigue.  Looks like the whole world's pulling him down. Staring down the street at a \nBRICK BUILDING on the corner.  A placard by the front door: Dr. Florence Agee, D.D.S. \nWill checks his watch.  Rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands.  Suddenly.  Something tells him to look up. \nA MAN \nin the distance, walking along the road.  Towards Dr. Agee's. He's in his forties.  Short, shoulders sloped.  Wears a beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots. \nWALTER BYRD \nhas a bulky hearing aid in one ear.  Is looking down at the road.  Glances up. \nLOCKS EYES WITH WILL \nByrd, slows his pace. \nWill, reaches for the door handle. \nSUDDENLY \nByrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast. \nWill leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him. \nWALTER BYRD \nhis short legs pumping, spots a TOUR BUS across the road. Veers over to it. \nWILL \na runner's stride.  Weaves through PEOPLE.  Closing in on Byrd.  Sees his plan.  Cuts across the road just as... \nA PICK-UP \nrounds the corner.  THUMP!  Broadsides him.  Will's pitched up and over the hood.  Falls hard on the tarmac.  Dazed for a second.  Blood, gushing from his forehead.  Hears the PICK-UP DOOR open...FEET running over to him. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Are you alright?  You popped out from nowhere! \nMore FEET running over. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) He okay? \nWill opens his eyes.  Trying to focus.

Scans the area for Byrd.  Nothing.  Then, sees the last few PEOPLE boarding the ferry. \nINT. FERRY - MINUTES LATER \nFerry's getting pitched around in the roiling water.  Most everyone is inside.  TOURISTS with throw-away cameras, backpacks, anoraks, CHILDREN.  Some looking sea-sick in the corner. \nWill weaves through the crowd.  Eyes darting, searching.  The ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, Will spots \nWALTER BYRD standing by a window. \nINT. WINDOW - FERRY \nWalter holds on to the railing.  Looking at the view, the sea spray.  Will comes up.  Stands next to him.  Cognizant of the people around them. \nWILL Walter Byrd. \nWalter continues looking out the window.  That same stuffed- nose voice. \nWALTER When I was seven my mother and grandmother took me to Vancouver.  We were walking along the street one day when these two men ran past and snatched my grandmother's purse right from under her arm.  Right from under her arm.  That night a police officer came to our hotel room to ask us questions.  Stood the whole time. \nThe ferry pitches again.  Will grabs on to the railing. Looking down at this little man.  Hate in his eyes. \nWALTER (cont'd) His uniform looked brand new.  His shoes and badge were polished, his billy club, his belt buckle.  All perfect.  He was like a soldier, but better. \nWalter reaches up to blow his nose.  Will's eyes look on in disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen.  From beating Kay Connell to death. \nWALTER (cont'd) Made a huge impression on me.  His goodness.  Gave me an instant respect for the police.  I tried to become a cop when I left high school, but... \nHe points to his hearing-aid. \nWALTER (cont'd) Congenital problem. \nThe ferry's engine HUMS to a stop.  Walter smiles. \nWALTER (cont'd) Oh.  We're here. \nEXT. GENDREAU GLACIER - DAY \nGendreau Glacier.  Spilling down between two huge mountains. Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power. \nWill and Walter walk up its face, away from the other tourists.  Walter leads the way.  Hands in his pockets. \nWALTER You know this glacier moves a quarter of an inch every day? \nHe points off to the horizon. \nWALTER (cont'd) And on a clear day you can see all the way over to Newtok.  There's a beautiful aviary over there.  We can go sometime. \nWill's lip curls.  Watching him. \nWALTER (cont'd) It's actually cool for this time of year. Normally the temperature runs about... \nSUDDENLY Will lunges at him.  Walter's eyes widen in surprise as he grabs him up by the collar.  Nose to nose.  Will barely keeping control. \nWILL You think this is a nice meeting we're having here?  Friendly?  Two people getting acquainted? (jerks him harder) You sick, coward, fuck.  I get up every morning of my life just to bring someone like you down.  Beating a seventeen year- old girl to death.  Washing her afterwards, cleaning her.  Make you feel like a real man? (tightens his grip) Huh? \nWalter flounders. \nWILL (cont'd) I outta end this right now.  Take a rock and smash your fucking skull in... \nHis jaws tense, nostrils flare.  Walter, red-faced, sputtering... \nWALTER I stood right behind you...I saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him... \nWill clenches his teeth. \nWALTER (cont'd) ...Seattle's great hero.  Shooting his own partner.  I saw it all... \nWILL That was an accident!  You hear me?  I didn't know it was him! (shakes him hard) I didn't know it was him! \nJust then a SHRIEK.  Will looks over \nA COUPLE KIDS.  Further down the glacier.  Having a snowball fight. \nWill looks back at Walter.  Has to take it easy.  Shoves him away in disgust.  Walter falls down onto the snow.  Dislodges his hearing aid. \nWatches Will pace.  Head throbbing.  Ribs, screaming in pain. \nWALTER Then why lie about it? \nWalter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.  Puts it back around his ear. \nWALTER (cont'd) I mean, I'm all for bending the truth. That's what I do in my novels.  It's my trade you might say.  But why cover it up? \nGets up.  Brushes the snow from his butt.  Checks something in his pocket. \nWALTER (cont'd) You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.  I'm sure you have some reason. Something noble.  I have faith in that. \nLooks down at the kids.  Shakes his head. \nWALTER (cont'd) They should be bundled up better. \nWILL What's your game, Byrd? \nWalter turns back to him. \nWALTER No game. \nWILL The phone call.  The knapsack. \nWalter shrugs. \n", "test3_id": 2192}

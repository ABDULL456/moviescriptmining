Bob takes dictation again. 
GROUCHO Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately. 
BOB I'll have to enclose the check first. 
GROUCHO You do and I'll fire you. 
Groucho glares over his shoulder at Bob to emphasize his remark as the latter exits from the scene.  Mrs. Teasdale enters to Groucho. 
MRS. TEASDALE (To Groucho) Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor -- (Indicating the guests with a wave of her hand) This is a gala day for us. 
GROUCHO Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more. 
MRS. TEASDALE If it's not asking too much -- (Recitative) For our information just for illustration (Begins tune) Tell us how you intend to run the nation. 
GROUCHO (Singing) These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden... 
ENSEMBLE (Singing) We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA 
GROUCHO (Singing) If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden... 
ENSEMBLE (Singing) If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued - 
GROUCHO If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it. (Does sailor's hornpipe) The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it. (Does Highland fling) The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. (Takes flute from inside pocket and plays strain of Dixie) 
DIGNITARY (Singing) In our midst you stand The ruler of this land A man who'll govern with an iron hand. 
GROUCHO (Singing) If anyone gets fresh with me, I'll show him who's the boss; I'll stand upon my dignity, And toss him for a loss.  And this will be the penalty For those who doublecross - We'll stand 'em up against the wall, and Pop goes the Weasel 
ENSEMBLE (Singing) If you should make him cross, He'll toss you for a loss.  If anyone gets fresh with him, He'll show him who's the boss. 
Groucho does minuet with girls as above is sung 
GROUCHO (Singing) I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel! 
ENSEMBLE (Singing) So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. (Groucho dances as above is sung) 
GROUCHO (Singing) If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel! 
ENSEMBLE (Singing) The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. (Groucho dances as above is sung) 
GROUCHO The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.

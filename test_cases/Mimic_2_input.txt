hears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking. 
His head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in his eyes. 
ACROSS THE ROOFTOP 
We are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's attention. 
TICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK... 
The strange clicking sound grows louder.  The figure begins moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps forward and drops out of frame. 
CHUY 
His eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow arc. 
Chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get a better view. 
GROUND LEVEL 
The Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake. 
CHUY 
We isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other noise FADES AWAY. 
Chuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby. 
He begins to click them together. 
Imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago. 
THE CHINESE PREACHER 
is being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through this hole. 
CHUY 
watches, still clicking with his spoons. 
THE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY 
is stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing against the wall next to the vent. Impossible. 
There is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body like a rag doll. 
CHUY 
His spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear terrible cracking and scraping sounds. 
THE WINDOW 
The Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of the opening. 
CHUY 
watches, still fascinated. 
CHUY (very low) Funny, funny shoes... 
He starts a new wire sculpture.

EXT. JOGGING PATH - CENTRAL PARK - DAWN 
Peter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun. 
Peter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS. 
PETER Excuse me, ladies... 
Without slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past them. 
EXT. JOGGER'S PATH - NEAR FIFTH AVENUE - LATER 
Peter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a water fountain. 
As he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the sidewalk. 
The derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off. 
Intrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points to a manhole cover set among the bushes. 
Peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines. 
Then the painted motif finally reveals itself. 
GRAFFITI 
A talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is little more than a malignant blotch.

INT. MUSEUM - EXHIBIT ROOM - DAY 
A room of half-finished exhibits. A group of SCULPTORS -- most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece representing a termite mound.  They're supervised by SIRI, a punkish young Indian research assistant. 
Susan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale clay model of an insect's head.  She gestures to the model's mandible set. 
SUSAN ...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let me tell you why. Insects have no hands. All they have is this set of mandibles. 
She grabs the outer mandible set. 
SUSAN See?  This little piggy will grab the prey.

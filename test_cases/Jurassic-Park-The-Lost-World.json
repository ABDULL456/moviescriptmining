{"test1_input": "Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's divided into sections, for different laboratory functions. The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays, dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video monitors. \nNext to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of processors, and a communications section.  All the lab equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down. \nShe notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black ink. \nKelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five. Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath the whole island chain, there is a bold legend. \n\"The Five Deaths,\" it says. \nSlowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters of those three ominous words. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OPEN SEA - DAY \nThe map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of Malcolm's team. \nON THE BOAT, \nMALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing, seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines. \nJUTTISON (as the waves pound the boat) Couldn't -- we just -- airlift -- into the -- island? \nMALCOLM Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea! Helicopters are too disruptive. These aren't piles of bones you'll be studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they live, they breathe, and they react! \nJuttson looks at him skeptically -- \n-- and throws up. \nAT THE BACK OF THE BOAT, \nNICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him. \nSARAH So what's your story, Nick? \nNICK I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace. \nSARAH That must be interesting.  What drew you there? \nNICK Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace. \nSARAH Very noble of you. (of the noisy Game Boy) You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you? \nNick grins and shuts it off. \nNICK Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths. \nSARAH You think this is all a joke? \nNICK Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when -- (gestures to the black-clad Malcolm) -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island? \nSARAH (not amused) Ian's a very good friend of mine. \nNICK He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink. \nSARAH I believe in him. \nBut her face says even she has her doubts. \nNICK Come on, there's only one reason any of us are here.  His check cleared. \nShe looks at him. \nSARAH Drop the cynical pose.  You can't pull it off while playing Donkey Kong. \nThe boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to them. \nCAPTAIN There it is! \nThey all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear, reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of the fog-heavy ocean. \nCAPTAIN (cont'd) Isla Sorna! \nThe boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The mist swirls and encircles it. \nEXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY \nA narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island. \nEXT. LAGOON - DAY \nLush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon. Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries of JUNGLE BIRDS. \nThe boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it, swapping its track for the animal's. \nMALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN. \nMALCOLM Be back in three days, but keep the satellite phone on and your radio tuned to the frequency I specified in case we need you sooner. \nCAPTAIN Don't worry.  I've lived around here all my life, these islands are completely -- \nIn the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide. \nCAPTAIN (cont'd) -- safe. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY \nThe jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley shimmers in midday heat. \nEDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage color. \nAs the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it from view. \nNICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the ground.  Malcolm notices. \nMALCOLM Listen.  I know you all have probably concluded that I'm out of my mind. \nIs it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just sway slightly? \nMALCOLM (cont'd) That's all right, for now.  But just humor me and be careful. \nNo, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back again. \nMALCOLM (cont'd) Even if you think I'm harmless and deluded, I promise -- \nNow the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen it, and now Malcolm turns around too. \nMALCOLM (cont'd) -- this place is for real. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY \nIt's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data input. \nAll the way in the back, past the spare tires and life preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND. \nA plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old daughter. \nThe card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish liquid.  We can guess. \nShe leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can. She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut. \nA sign on the door says \"RESTROOM.\"  Inside, a SIGH of relief is heard. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY \nAlong a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest trees to their right. \nAt the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and urgent. \nEDDIE Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart. \nHe cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning tag -- \"EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!\" \nEDDIE (cont'd) I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus purpurascens, the South Sea cone shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in the world.  Acts within a two-thousandth of a second.  Faster than the nerve-conduction velocity. The animal's down before it feels the prick of the dart. \nFrom their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right along with the animals as they move in the foliage. \nMALCOLM (to Eddie) Is there an antidote? \nEDDIE Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger. \nAhead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden movement -- \n-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a break in the foliage. \nIt's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a huge lumbering body. \nA double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it. \nThe gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and sticks there. \nNICK Oh -- \nJUTTSON -- my -- \nEDDIE -- God! \nSARAH It's beautiful! \nA second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult. \nWhile the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet. \nApparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed. \nSarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible. \nJuttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into it breathlessly. \nJUTTSON Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae, infraorder Stegosauria, suborder Thyreophora.  Length, adult male, estimate twenty-five to thirty feet. \nHis breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers his mouth, trying to keep him quiet. \nSARAH (to Juttsn) That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound! \n", "test1_id": 2157, "test2_input": "The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten foot tall animal. \nDIETER (cont'd) Now! \nAlmost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it. \nUP ON THE RIDGE, \nNick turns away.  He can't watch. \nDOWN ON THE PLAIN, \na bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat. \nLudlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes glowing. \nThe animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily. Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck. \nA blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air. \nDR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a syringe. \nHe draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and injects it into the animal's thigh. \nCARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo orange. \nDieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of the animal. \nDIETER Next case. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIDGE - NIGHT \nNight has fallen over the island.  The hunters have established base camp in an area they have trampled and cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a central campfire. \nThe vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents. At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen \"capture containers,\" cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they have already rounded up. \nSARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above, looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge. VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING. \nDR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on the cages. \nJUTTSON Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus -- triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus -- or small scavengers only. \nMalcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing something below. \nTHROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS, \nhe sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp, pointing, giving orders. \nON THE RIDGE, \nMalcolm drops the binoculars. \nMALCOLM Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in such a hurry for me to get here.  He knew they were coming. \nHe gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly. \nMALCOLM (cont'd) You okay? \nSARAH (irritated) Heights, I can't help it.  Put your arm here, will you? \nShe puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is close to the cliff edge. \nJUTTSON What do they want? \nMALCOLM They want their money back.  To InGen, this island is nothing more than a bed investment. \nJUTTSON We should get back to base camp. Eddie's waiting for us. \nMALCOLM I can't believe Peter Ludlow's running all this. \nSARAH He isn't.  Check out the guy walking past the fire. \nShe hands the binoculars to Malcolm. \nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS, \nMalcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and equipment slung over their shoulders. \nSARAH (o.s.) I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He and that guy with him were spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was immoral to go after them any other way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats you up with your own argument. \nBACK ON THE RIDGE, \nSARAH (cont'd) He's the one in charge. \nMALCOLM Well, if that's true -- the man in charge just left camp. \nNick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps forward. \nNICK Then this is our chance. \nMALCOLM Our chance to do what? \nNICK I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy. \n", "test2_true": "NICK (cont'd) Nobody has to come with me.  I've done this before. \nSARAH Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger. \nHe looks at her, hurt. \nNICK There' no reason for name calling. \nMALCOLM Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so. \nKELLY What are you guys gonna do? \nMALCOLM (signs) Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT \nIn the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition. PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out. \nEXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT \nIn the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what protest.  Roland looks up. \nROLAND Offering a little incentive. \nLudlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's gun leaning against a tree. \nLUDLOW What kind of gun is that? \nROLAND My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force. \nLUDLOW How close do you have to be? \nROLAND Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down. \nLUDLOW Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill? \nRoland just looks at him. \nROLAND Or a laser beam from a satellite? \nLudlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut with a leather strap. \nLUDLOW You rally think this'll draw the parent? \nROLAND I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill. \nLUDLOW Killing lessons?  Heartwarming. \nROLAND Rex won't be any different.  It'll come. \nLUDLOW You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would -- \nHe stops, an idea on his face. \nLUDLOW (cont'd) Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives... growth inhibitors... \nROLAND What? \nLUDLOW I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me -- (close to the animal) You are a billion dollar idea, my little f- \nCRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut, lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain, clutching his bleeding face. \nRoland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in pain. \nRoland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage is done. \nROLAND What the hell you do that for?! \nAs his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts to cover. \nLUDLOW Had to.  To keep him still for the trip. \nROLAND You've broken its leg! \nLUDLOW We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member? \nHe gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp, trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT \nAt the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart, the tallest almost six feet off the ground. \nNick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm, steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then left alone on the other side. \nHe backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then springs off his good leg -- \n-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two. \nFURTHER IN THE CAMP, \n", "test2_id": 2158, "test3_input": "LUDLOW There's a communication center, here, in the old worker village.  Hammond put in some kind of renewable power source replenishing.  It may still work.  If we could get there, we could send a radio call for the airlift. \nNICK How far is the village? \nLUDLOW I said if we could get there. \nNICK Well, how far is it? \nLUDLOW A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not the problem. \nROLAND What is? \nLUDLOW The velociraptors. \nMalcolm looks up sharply. \nLUDLOW (cont'd) Our infrareds show their nesting sites are concentrated in the island interior.  That's why we planned on keeping to the outer rim. \nMalcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters something to her quietly in the background. \nDIETER What are velociraptors? \nJUTTSON Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six feet long, three or four hundred pounds, and very, very fast. \nDieter brandishes his weapon. \nDIETER I think we can handle ourselves against them. \nMalcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice low. \nMALCOLM No.  I'm quite certain you can't. \nROLAND Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help. \nMALCOLM We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter. \nRoland looks at him. \nROLAND That may be.  But you weren't with me at the time. \nMalcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to Kelly.  Roland turns to the others. \nROLAND (cont'd) Load up.  Let's get this moveable feast underway. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ISLAND - NIGHT \nThe SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in. \nMALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself. \nMALCOLM Damn it. \nHe looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp. \nROLAND You all right? \nMalcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering. \nROLAND (cont'd) Wrong question? \nMALCOLM You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin? \nROLAND What's that? \nMALCOLM A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together. \nROLAND Feeling a bit blue, are we? \nMalcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace and is a few steps ahead of them now. \nMALCOLM Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed. \nROLAND Why did you come here? \nMALCOLM So that others would know about this place? \nROLAND Why should they? \nMALCOLM Because it exists. \nROLAND It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it? \nMALCOLM Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth. \nROLAND So the truth is more important to you than your life? \nMALCOLM (lowers is voice) I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger -- \nRoland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten yards ahead now. \nROLAND She yours? \nAHEAD OF THEM, \n", "test3_true": "MALCOLM (o.s.) I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the hell I'm doing with kids.  I never should have had her. \nKelly's face shows she heard that part. \nBEHIND HER, \nMalcolm, unaware, continues with Roland. \nMALCOLM (cont'd) Why are you here? \nROLAND Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down. \nMALCOLM But why? \nROLAND You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, \"why did you go up there to die?\"  And he said \"I didn't.  I went up there to live.\" \nMALCOLM (nods) It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that- \nEvery person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear. \nROLAND Tell you what.  You can see whatever you want to, to me, but you will not spew any more nihilist rants at anyone else in the group.  I'm fighting panic, and you push the wrong buttons.  Understand? \nMalcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE - DAWN \nAs a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm swats his hand away. \nKELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH. \nKELLY I don't think -- my dad doesn't think we're going to make it. \nSarah looks at her. \nSARAH Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more than he knows. \nShe puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful. The long march continues. \nUP AT THE FRONT, \nNICK catches up to ROLAND. \nNICK I think you should call a break. \nROLAND Another half hour. \nNICK Some of them won't make another half hour.  We didn't come this far to start dropping in the middle of the jungle.  If you don't call it, I will. \nRoland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group. \nROLAND FIVE MINUTES BREAK! \nImmediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely drained. \nAT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, \nDRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering. \nJUTTSON I can't believe you're still angry about that. \nBURKE You know, it's very easy to criticize the first person who studies something. \nJUTTSON No, it's easy to criticize sloppy research and hasty conclusions. \nNEARBY, \nMALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him. \nSARAH You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy. \nMALCOLM Maybe.  Maybe not. \nSARAH Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square. \nHe doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her. \nSARAH (cont'd) There's something more important that you should be thinking about instead. \nBEHIND THEM, \nDr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up. \nIt's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled exterior.  A dinosaur egg. \nBurke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder. \nAT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, \nDIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him -- CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned. \nDIETER Wait here for me, would ya Carter? \n", "test3_id": 2159}

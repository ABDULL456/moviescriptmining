{"train": "THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK \nTHE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK \nScreenplay by David Koepp based on the novel by Michael Crichton \nEXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY \nA 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted. \nISLA SORNA 87 miles southeast of Nublar \nTwo SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal decanters with red and white wine. \nPAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side, reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than once, supervises the settings of the table. \nShe looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight years old, wandering off down the beach. \nMRS. BOWMAN Cathy!  Don't wander off! \nCathy keeps wandering. \nMRS. BOWMAN (cont'd) Cathy, come back!  You can look for shells right here! \nCathy gestures, pretending she can't hear. \nBOWMAN (eyes still in his book) Leave her alone. \nMRS. BOWMAN What about snakes? \nBOWMAN There's no snakes on a beach.  Let her have fun, for once. \nFURTHER DOWN THE BEACH, \nCathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance. \nCATHY Please be quiet, please be quiet please be quiet... \nRounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the sand. \nA large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush, which abruptly stops moving. \nA small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail. It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken. \nCATHY Well, hello there! \nThe animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats down on her haunches. \nCATHY (cont'd) What are you?  A little bird or something? \nShe opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers. \nCATHY (cont'd) Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish? \nThe compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously. \nCATHY (cont'd) Come on.  I won't hurt you. \nThe compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm of her hand.  The compy gets closer still -- \n-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats it. \nEnchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her hand, calling back over her shoulder. \nCATHY (cont'd) Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this! I found something! \nShe turns back. \nThirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few feet away.  Cathy's smile fades. \nShe turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing and CHIPPING as they surround her. \nCATHY (cont'd) (terrified) What do you guys want? \nBACK ON THE BEACH, \nthe table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out. \nMRS. BOWMAN Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready! \nFrom around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly pierce the air. \nMRS. BOWMAN PAUL! \nShe takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them. \nDOWN THE BEACH, \nMrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BOARD ROOM - DAY \nMrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table hint that everyone's been here a long time. \n-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane. The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly. BUTLER Not an animal lover? \nMALCOLM Not really. \nINT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room; \nMedical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle. \nHAMMOND Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway like an ingenue, come in, come in! \nMalcolm steps further into the room. \nHAMMOND (cont'd) It's good to see you.  It really is. How's the leg? \nMALCOLM Resentful. \nHAMMOND When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned. Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it hard to sustain anger. MALCOLM I didn't know you -- weren't well. HAMMOND It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me. MALCOLM They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent. HAMMOND You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away. (pause) Thank God for Site B. Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment. MALCOLM What? HAMMOND (a spark in his eye) Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you? MALCOLM What are you talking about? HAMMOND The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you. \nMALCOLM I don't believe you. \nHAMMOND Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar. \nMALCOLM No, no, no, no, no, no . . . \nHAMMOND After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them. \nMALCOLM Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that? \nHAMMOND It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen. \nMALCOLM So what? \nHammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos, charts, maps and photographs. \nHAMMOND I've been putting this together for over a year. (MORE) I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost. \nMALCOLM John . . . \nHAMMOND You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously. \nMalcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly. \nHAMMOND Your documentation, you should use forensic photographic methods, Hasselbladt still cameras, high definition video.  When the trick photography analysts take your evidence apart, make it impossible for them to say there was enhancement or computer graphic imaging.  Oh, this is very important -- avoid the island interior at all costs.  Stick to the outer rim.  Everything you need to know can be found there. Vindication lies on the outer rim. \nMalcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond. \nMALCOLM I'm not going, John. \nHAMMOND (fatigue returning) Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before -- \nHe stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns. PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond to Malcolm suspiciously. \nLUDLOW Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm. \nMalcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes him. \nLUDLOW (cont'd) Did I interrupt something? \nMalcolm turns back to Hammond. \nMALCOLM Find someone else. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT \nIn the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle rudely, and shepherds him to the door. \nLUDLOW So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you? \nMALCOLM Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there. \nLUDLOW You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement. \nMALCOLM You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children. \nLUDLOW If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to-- \nMALCOLM I didn't tell anything, I told the truth. \nLUDLOW You version of it. \nMALCOLM There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life. \nLUDLOW We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries. \nMALCOLM It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never-- \nLUDLOW InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it. \nLudlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with one hand.  It's his cane. \nLUDLOW (cont'd) Don't forget that. \nAjay just smiles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT \nThe African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green, seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of long grass. \nThe grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face. \nSARAH Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped snout. \nSarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead of the hyenas to their prey. \nIt's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet. \nSarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant. \nSARAH (cont'd) They'll try to take down a calf. Come on. \nMAKENA Closer? \nSarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows. Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running through it, trying to break it up. \nMAKENA (cont'd) You know, we could see everything from up on the edge of that cliff. \nSARAH No way. \nMAKENA But the view would -- \nSARAH No cliffs. (into a pocket recorder) F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking, twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6 circling wide east.  Can't see F7. \nWhile she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action. Makena follows, with growing unease. \nMAKENA Sarah. \nSARAH F8 circling north.  F1 straight through, disrupting.  Herd moving, stamping.  There's F7.  Straight through.  F8 angling through from the north. \nShe's practically on top of the animals now. \nMAKENA Dr. Harding. \nMakena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah, wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer. \nSuddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody. \nThe adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the tape recorder. \nSARAH Brooding behavior in evidence at the kill site, pups are ushered forward and adults help them eat, pulling flesh away from the carcass and-- \nA telephone rings. \nSarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once, pawing at a backpack. \nSARAH (cont'd) (a frantic whisper) I thought you turned it off! \nTwo hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone. Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation. \nSARAH (cont'd) Yes?! \nSomeone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes. \nSARAH (cont'd) Ian.  This better be important. \nSarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as the voice on the other end talks.  And talks. \nSARAH (cont'd) When? \nCUT TO: \nINT. MOBILE FIELD SYSTEMS - DAY \nIan Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the end of a bench.  Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and MALCOLM is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while talking on a satellite phone. \nMALCOLM We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five member team. \nBehind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).  The hood of the AAV is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller engine is lowered in its place.  To one side are two long trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other. \nMALCOLM Eddie Carr's handling all our equipment and he'll be there to maintain it.  He's designing special field trailers now, top of the line mobile research units. \nEDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen. \nEDDIE No, no, look at the plans, Henry, you can't place that strut laterally, it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE PLANS! \nFrom the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding. \nWORKMAN Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test it \nEddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular, constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs up the phone and walks up, joining him. \nMALCOLM Any damage? \nEDDIE Minimal. \nMALCOLM \"Minimal\" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong -- \nInside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's divided into sections, for different laboratory functions. The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays, dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video monitors. \nNext to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of processors, and a communications section.  All the lab equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down. \nShe notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black ink. \nKelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five. Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath the whole island chain, there is a bold legend. \n\"The Five Deaths,\" it says. \nSlowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters of those three ominous words. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OPEN SEA - DAY \nThe map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of Malcolm's team. \nON THE BOAT, \nMALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing, seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines. \nJUTTISON (as the waves pound the boat) Couldn't -- we just -- airlift -- into the -- island? \nMALCOLM Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea! Helicopters are too disruptive. These aren't piles of bones you'll be studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they live, they breathe, and they react! \nJuttson looks at him skeptically -- \n-- and throws up. \nAT THE BACK OF THE BOAT, \nNICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him. \nSARAH So what's your story, Nick? \nNICK I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace. \nSARAH That must be interesting.  What drew you there? \nNICK Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace. \nSARAH Very noble of you. (of the noisy Game Boy) You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you? \nNick grins and shuts it off. \nNICK Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths. \nSARAH You think this is all a joke? \nNICK Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when -- (gestures to the black-clad Malcolm) -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island? \nSARAH (not amused) Ian's a very good friend of mine. \nNICK He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink. \nSARAH I believe in him. \nBut her face says even she has her doubts. \nNICK Come on, there's only one reason any of us are here.  His check cleared. \nShe looks at him. \nSARAH Drop the cynical pose.  You can't pull it off while playing Donkey Kong. \nThe boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to them. \nCAPTAIN There it is! \nThey all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear, reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of the fog-heavy ocean. \nCAPTAIN (cont'd) Isla Sorna! \nThe boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The mist swirls and encircles it. \nEXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY \nA narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island. \nEXT. LAGOON - DAY \nLush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon. Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries of JUNGLE BIRDS. \nThe boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it, swapping its track for the animal's. \nMALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN. \nMALCOLM Be back in three days, but keep the satellite phone on and your radio tuned to the frequency I specified in case we need you sooner. \nCAPTAIN Don't worry.  I've lived around here all my life, these islands are completely -- \nIn the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide. \nCAPTAIN (cont'd) -- safe. \nJUTTSON I want to see the nesting ground! \nNick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile, wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera. Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group continues on into the bush after the animals. \nIN THE BUSH, \nthe baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson, who is beside her. \nSARAH Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't see an egg clutch... \nShe gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field glasses. \nJUTTSON (whispering back) The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive! \nSARAH Not without a shot of the nest. \nShe sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it, using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the other two. \nNick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the clearing. \nIN THE CLEARING, \nSarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back, toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south. She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd, ever better as she gets closer. \nBACK AT THE HILL, \nthe others can only watch her, aghast. \nNICK She's gutty. \nMALCOLM She's nuts. \nIN THE CLEARING, \nSarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture after picture from this ideal vantage point. \nShe shoots the last picture on the roll -- \n-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her hands. \nTh noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and starts to move away, slowly. \nThe male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah leaps back at the last second -- \n-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was. \nSarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly for animals their size. \nThe others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts right up off the ground. \nIt's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them. \nThe Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them. \nNow a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting into position behind the second. \nNick swings his video camera straight up and the group suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating. \nThe mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING to the jungle floor. \nThe group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath the animals! \nAmid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest the jungle around them. \nThe noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group. \nThere is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest. \nA SHORT DISTANCE AWAY, \nthe Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and throws her arms around him, exhilarated. \nSARAH Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad! \nJUTTSON (out of breath) Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY \nSuddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and blows it out. \nSARAH No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact. \nMALCOLM That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change. \nNick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a sharpie, to label it. \nNICK What should I call this?  \"Jurassic Pork?\" \nEddie, next to him, laughs. \nSARAH (still to Malcolm) And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible. \nJUTTSON I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did. \nAT A RIDGE, \nthe members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a specific spot. \nEddie raises a pair of field glasses. \nDOWN BELOW, \nhuge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land. \nNow MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude parachutes billowing open behind them. \nUP ON THE RIDGE, \nNick looks at Sarah. \nNICK You were saying something about antiseptic? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY \nMetal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp. \nPETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged, pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses. \nLUDLOW Welcome to your dream come true, Dr. Burke. \nBurke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that he spreads out on the hood of a jeep. \nBURKE I believe the large herbivores forage in open plains, like bison, which would explain the great variety of heat dots we're reading in the flatlands around this waterhole. Right -- here. \nLUDLOW Then that's where we're going. \nBurke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the dashboard. \nBURKE (calling them off) Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus! Maiasaurus! \nAs the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the man we saw welding earlier. \nLUDLOW This is as good a place as any for base camp.  First priority is the laser barriers, I want them all up and running in thirty minutes.  Half an hour, understand? \nDieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the hunter from the bar in Mombassa. \nROLAND Cancel that, Dieter. \nLUDLOW What?  Why? \nRoland points to a stream running nearby. \nROLAND Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar? \nLUDLOW (thinks) You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks. \nDieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around Ludlow and pulls him aside. \nROLAND Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay? \nLUDLOW (what else can he say?) Okay. \nROLAND Good lad. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE \nThe jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the \"speedbird,\" waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at the wheel beside him. \nLUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE. ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well. \nIn the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks around the front of the car and sees -- \n-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing, a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke. \nBurke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face. \nBURKE Pachycephalosaurus! \nLUDLOW Carnivore? \nBURKE (enchanted) Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant eater, see that distinctive domed skull?  That's nine inches of solid bone. \nLUDLOW (who cares?) Just get them out of the way, Dieter. \nDIETER COME ON, MOVE IT!! \nThe pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with them, they go back to their grass. \nDIETER (cont'd) Oh, for God's -- \nHe slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the second jeep. \nROLAND Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a war.  Use your powers of persuasion. \nDieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does, slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do not move.  Dieter walks toward them. \nNICK (angry) Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already! \nSARAH Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army. \nKelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as they move below. \nKELLY \"InGen.\"  What's InGen? \nMALCOLM Where does it say that? \nKELLY On the side of that one truck. \nMalcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself. \nJUTTSON InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it? \nNICK (to Malcolm) Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?! \nMALCOLM No!  We're an independently funded expedition. \nSARAH Funded by whom? \nMALCOLM John Hammond. \nJUTTSON But he's the head of InGen! \nNICK You gotta be kidding. (to Malcolm) You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else? \nKELLY Yeah, what have you done, Dad? \nSARAH We'd better keep moving, or we'll lose them. \nThe group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring through the binoculars. \nMALCOLM What are you doing to me, John? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CAVES - DAY \nAJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the far left. \nRoland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good. \nHe proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a black interior. \nRoland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old, crawling with white maggots and flies. \nRoland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies. \nStill he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched. \nCrawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular rampart of dried mud, and peer into -- \n-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls. \nA BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a scraggly appearance. \nIt SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp teeth. \nThe cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and WHISPERS. \nROLAND It's the rex nest. \nAjay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks up, cocking its head in curiosity. \nAJAY Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return? \nROLAND (shakes his head no) If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck -- \nIn the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders. \nROLAND (cont'd) -- is to get him to come where we want him. \nThe baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks down at it.  Thinking. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIDGE - DUSK \nAs the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista below the ridge. \nIn the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS, and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below. MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the ridge. \nTHROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS \nWe see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The binoculars whip to the right -- \n-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES! \nThere are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a wrangler's pickup truck. \nAlthough there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's almost eerily silent. \nON THE RIDGE, \nthe three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're directly behind the row of vehicle. \nThey move, into the open, covering the ground between them and the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout. \nUNDER THE JEEP, \nNick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms along until he finds the jeep's fuel line -- \n-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt. \nMALCOLM AND SARAH \nmove slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves to the third. \nFrom in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint, high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that direction. \nEXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT \nIt's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree, ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground. \nThey wait. \nRoland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He scans it, searching for any sign of movement. \nEXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT \nBack in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline. \nThe saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the partiers visible as they move inside. \nThey continue across the camp and arrive at the other side -- \n-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its row of fine bristling. \nAnd finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye. \nNICK Hang on.  We may encounter some turbulence. \nINT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT \nIn one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist. There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the photos, indicating where certain species can be found. \nBURKE If you're really interested in infants, we'll have better luck at the seaside, because the sands offer a cushioning surface where the egg clutches can -- can -- \nHe trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board. \nThey look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside, someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent -- \n-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas! \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT \nHUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and confusion, chaos reigns. \nIn the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey. \nThe triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS INTO FLAME. \nNow really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling across the camp. \nThe jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side. Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas. \nThe jeep explodes. \nOUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING, \nRoland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a fireball rises up from the camp in the distance. \nROLAND What in God's -- ! \nBACK IN THE CAMP, \nthe rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing animals. \nAT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, \nNick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other. \nThe burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS. \nDieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past him, spinning to a stop -- \n-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him. \nROLAND Last time I leave you in charge. \nOUT IN THE JUNGLE, \nNick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur chained to the stake. \nNICK Sick bastards. \nHe goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls the stake out of the ground. \nBACK IN THE CAMP, \nMalcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall, completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and speaks shakily into it. \nSARAH Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus rex does nurture its young. \nThey laugh weakly. \nNICK There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One \"no\" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed. (pause) Well?  Do we go on? Immediately: \nSARAH No. \nMALCOLM No. \nNICK No way. \nThey all laugh. \nMALCOLM All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too. (to Sarah) Do you have enough to publish? \nSARAH They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back. \nMALCOLM (getting up) Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over. \nHe goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel lights up, a brilliant green. \nBut from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S VOICE breaks through, soft and empty. \nEDDIE (o.s.) Oh, God.  I am so sorry. \nMalcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box. \nMALCOLM What the hell is he sorry f- \nA low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates, everything in it starts to BANG against the walls -- \n-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer. \nThey're all thrown against the far wall, there is an earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black. \nThe satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still glowing green. \nNick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside, the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window, revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the trailer! \nNICK HANG ON TO SOMETHING! \nThey hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down. \nSarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment, everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them; everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM. \nBut the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION, sliding forwards. \nSEEN FROM OUTSIDE, \nthe upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in front of it. \nIN THE TRAILER, \nSARAH They're pushing us! \nMalcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside. He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside as they move past it. \nHe cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees outside the window. \nMALCOLM Oh, God. \nSARAH What?! \nMALCOLM They're pushing us over the cliff. \nSure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of them look at each other for a moment -- \n-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it. \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER, \nwhich is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at it, pushing the front end of the trailer. \nIN THE REAR TRAILER, \nNick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill. \nThe angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head. \nMalcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah, starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator, getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety latch, doesn't open. \nBelow Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer. Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five hundred feet below. \nThe refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The box strains on its power cord. \nStill clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts to come loose, swaying above her. \nThe safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the contents. \nSarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break. \nFIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW, \nEddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He SHOUTS in through the broken front window. \nEDDIE HEY!  HELLO?! \nIN THE REAR TRAILER, \nThe three look up from their precarious positions. \nMALCOLM WE'RE IN HERE!  GET SOME ROPE! \nOUTSIDE, \nEddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the trailer. \nIN THE REAR TRAILER, \nEddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down into the second trailer, and tosses the rope. \nEDDIE Catch! \nThe rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again. \nSARAH We're sliding! \nEDDIE Climbs up if you can! \nOUTSIDE, \nEddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff. \nHe runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the front grill. \nBehind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff. \nEddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for its towing hook, the cable goes taut -- \n-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of cable. \nEDDIE Damn it! \nINSIDE THE TRAILER, \nNick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is further up, also clinging to the rope. \nOUTSIDE, \ndirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the edge of the cliff. \nEddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND! \nEddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches toward the edge of the cliff and stops. \nBut the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure. \nIN THE TRAILER, \nMalcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING, they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through the remains of the rear window. \nRegaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer, dangling over the rocky shore below. \nIN THE JEEP, \nEddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold it there. \nON THE CLIFFSIDE \nSarah and Nick dangle, desperate. \nIN THE JEEP \nEddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another ROAR, in the distance. \nAnd this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle. \nEddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of the jungle behind him. \nHe GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the OTHER REX racing toward him. \nThe tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep. The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and lifts the car to its teeth. \nBut the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it. Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground. \nEddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get away.  The gas pedal pops up -- \n-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff. \nBut the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape. The trailers stop. \nNow the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie, who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully exposed. \nHe SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its teeth and tossing him out of the car. \nEddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he disappears between their teeth. \nNow completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the trailers drop over the edge of the cliff. \nLUDLOW There's a communication center, here, in the old worker village.  Hammond put in some kind of renewable power source replenishing.  It may still work.  If we could get there, we could send a radio call for the airlift. \nNICK How far is the village? \nLUDLOW I said if we could get there. \nNICK Well, how far is it? \nLUDLOW A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not the problem. \nROLAND What is? \nLUDLOW The velociraptors. \nMalcolm looks up sharply. \nLUDLOW (cont'd) Our infrareds show their nesting sites are concentrated in the island interior.  That's why we planned on keeping to the outer rim. \nMalcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters something to her quietly in the background. \nDIETER What are velociraptors? \nJUTTSON Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six feet long, three or four hundred pounds, and very, very fast. \nDieter brandishes his weapon. \nDIETER I think we can handle ourselves against them. \nMalcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice low. \nMALCOLM No.  I'm quite certain you can't. \nROLAND Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help. \nMALCOLM We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter. \nRoland looks at him. \nROLAND That may be.  But you weren't with me at the time. \nMalcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to Kelly.  Roland turns to the others. \nROLAND (cont'd) Load up.  Let's get this moveable feast underway. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ISLAND - NIGHT \nThe SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in. \nMALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself. \nMALCOLM Damn it. \nHe looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp. \nROLAND You all right? \nMalcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering. \nROLAND (cont'd) Wrong question? \nMALCOLM You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin? \nROLAND What's that? \nMALCOLM A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together. \nROLAND Feeling a bit blue, are we? \nMalcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace and is a few steps ahead of them now. \nMALCOLM Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed. \nROLAND Why did you come here? \nMALCOLM So that others would know about this place? \nROLAND Why should they? \nMALCOLM Because it exists. \nROLAND It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it? \nMALCOLM Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth. \nROLAND So the truth is more important to you than your life? \nMALCOLM (lowers is voice) I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger -- \nRoland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten yards ahead now. \nROLAND She yours? \nAHEAD OF THEM, \nHe steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears. \nAnd he didn't hear a word. \nEXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY \nOnly a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself. \nHe clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger. \nNothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS-- \n-- and s SCURRYING around to his left. \nDieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him, he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago. \nDIETER It's not polite to -- \nHe pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain. \nDIETER (cont'd) -- sneak up on people. \nThe wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle, whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out into -- \n-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back or forward. \nHe looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing with his hands, retracing his steps. \nHe adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he stops again.  Still nothing but jungle. \nDIETER HEY!  CARTER!  YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE! \nON THE TRAIL, \nDieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in his ears. \nDIETER (o.s.) ...Carter... me?... \nIN THE JUNGLE, \nDieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the foliage, moving faster and faster. \nPanicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on his face. \nHe looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him. \nDieter GASPS as something rushes in at him. \nHe whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter scrambles up into a sitting position -- \n-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now, the same as the one he wounded. \nFor a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings his gun around, to point it at them. \nDIETER Easy -- wait -- one more sec- \nAs one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward, covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely. \nDieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly. Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off, SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on the ground. \nHysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING, shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon, which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six feet from him. \nLosing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse, stopping ten yards away from him. \nBut they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING. \nDieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his lost weapon. \nTen feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun. He turns to face the pursuing compys. \nThey stop. \nDieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms. \nThe compys turn and run.  Dieter stops. \nThe compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and SQUEALING. \nDieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away. \nThe compys follow. \nEXT. JUNGLE - DAY \nFrom the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out. \nROLAND Break's over, move on! \nThe exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up, hoists his backpack, and marches away. \nBehind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle trail. \nEXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY \nDIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream. \nROLAND Oh, no. \nIN SARAH'S TENT, \nKelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them, swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap. \nAs the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side, we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's right -- it's blood. \nThe baby T-rex's blood. \nAT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, \nthe thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire that's been lit by DR. BURKE. \nHe's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan. \nRoland and Ajay run up behind him. \nROLAND (hisses) ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! \nBurke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire. \nBMBB! \nRoland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that? \nIN SARAH'S TENT, \nSarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too. \nBMBB! \nAT THE COCKING FIRE, \nROLAND Get my weapon. \nAjay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold, staring down at the ground. \nBMBB! \nA recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric circles spreading to the outer edges. \nBMBB! \nIN SARAH'S TENT, \nSarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food into Ziploc bags. \nBMBB! \nNow they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves, and draw the zipper up, all the way around. \nOutside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent. Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last few inches, but -- \n-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the tent. \nIt sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously. \nIn the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag, trying to figure out what this thing is. \nIt rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and then rises, straights up -- \n-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground beneath it. \nIN THE CAMPSITE, \nthe SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake up.  Many of them start to run. \nRoland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep into the mud. \nRoland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked Hunters flee in all directions. \nROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! \nBut they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes. \nACROSS THE CAMPSITE, \nNICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into the jungle. \nIN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, \nMALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group. \nMALCOLM KELLY?  KEEEEELLLY?! \nBut he can't see her. \nAT THE EDGE OF CAMP, \nthe two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a narrow ravine. \nUP ON A ROCK RACE, \nRoland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle of the camp, start to head for the ravine. \nMalcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is nearly hysterical. \nROLAND She's okay!  They'll stay in there, she's okay! \nIN A JUNGLE CLEARING, \nrouted Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by long \"elephant\" grass. \nAJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of the grass, SHOUTING to the others. \nAWAY NO!  DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! \nNot in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding up at the edge of the jungle. \nAjay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after the other Hunters, waving his arms. \nUP ABOVE THEM, \nRoland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails as they plow through the grass. \nROLAND Elephant grass! \nON THE PLAIN, \nthe groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass. One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees. \nHUNTER They gave up!  They're not chasing us! \nThere are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his arms madly. \nBut in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind. They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get further away from the tyrannosaurs. \nABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY, \nthe tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter party.  The heads descend, back into the grass. \nBACK WITH THE HUNTERS, \nthey continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend. \nOn all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes. \nAnd these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall grass. \nIn his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal drops its head to make the kill. \nBehind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him -- \n-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass. \nVelociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs, the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes on attack. \nLike now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish into the twitching long grass. \nAnother raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air, past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey, and takes him down, into the grass. \nBehind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around, realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long grass. \nAround him, four torpedo trails head straight for him. \nAjay simply closes his eyes. \nUP ON THE ROCK, \nRoland turns away from the carnage, pained. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT \nSARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks decimated, spirits shattered. \nRoland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was. He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads. \nKelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at them, but Sarah waves him off -- \"she's okay.\" \nRoland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm, who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact. \nROLAND How many rounds did you find for that weapon? \nMALCOLM Four, counting the one in the chamber. \nROLAND Don't let it out of your hands again. (to Sara, but looking at Kelly) Can the kid walk? \nSARAH Ask her. \nROLAND Can the kid walk? \nKELLY I can.  I can walk. \nWhile he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow your gaze. \nROLAND We're going to find a path down into the interior of the island.  Load up whatever you think you need, and I mean need.  If you can't carry it indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll hit the worker village in a couple hours and be out of here before dawn. \nAT THE EDGE OF CAMP, \nRoland rejoins them. \nROLAND Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want anything to do with it, and neither does any other animal on this island. This building is now demarcated as the rex's territory.  As long as you stay in that building, you'll all be safe until the helicopter comes. \nHe drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful. \nJUTTSON Where are you going? \nROLAND After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill back in the valley with tyrannosaur tracks all around it.  If I'm not back in time, don't wait for me. \nSARAH You've got to be kidding. \nROLAND Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait. \nLUDLOW Do you think the rex might have the infant with it? \nROLAND Possible. \nLudlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick. \nLUDLOW You know how to work a radio, don't you? \nSARAH You're going too? \nLUDLOW I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11. \nHe takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it to Nick. \nLUDLOW (cont'd) This is the broadcast frequency.  ID yourself as \"Harvest Leader.\"  You know what to tell 'em. \nMALCOLM You gentlemen feel you have to do this now? \nROLAND Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry. \nLudlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle -- \nNICK No. \n-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun. \nNICK (cont'd) Only humans do. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT \nThe console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly, all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in. \nNICK (into microphone) CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come in, please. \nThe remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says \"We Make The Future,\"  but the words are obscured by a tangle of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet. \nOn one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered. \nThere is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the radio, clean as can be. \nVOICE (o.s.) Go ahead, Harvest Leader. \nThey all breath a sign of relief. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nWith Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the group inside the operations building, main street stands deserted and silent. \nNearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one end of the street -- \n-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT \nROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he saw earlier. \nA set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow follows Roland. \nAs they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them, washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal. \nHe reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended, then blow back at him. \nLUDLOW We're downwind.  Good. \nRoland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the shore.  Ludlow follows. \nThey creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise. \nOver the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up, to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at the water as well, drinking. \nRoland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to \"off.\" \nLudlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns, eyes blazing. \nOut in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nMALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out the front of the operations building.  At the end of the street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over the building, to land on its roof. \nMALCOLM There it is! \nHappily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if they once dripped there and then turned to stone. \nThis time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought occurs to her. \nSARAH Ian.  It's guano. \nMALCOLM What? \nSARAH These formations.  They're dried -- \nMALCOLM Birdshit? \nA VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them. \nThey don't see it. \nNICK Who cares?  Let's go! \nUnaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance between them quickly. \nThe animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group, and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the others, who fall like dominoes. \nJuttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL, as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him. \nSarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed. She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her hands -- \n-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the first raptor in the kill. \nPanicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the road. \nMalcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's gone now.  He looks around frantically. \nMALCOLM Kelly?!  KELLY?! \nSarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building nearest her. \nBehind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly. \nThe walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah, and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an abandoned car. \nBut the car door is thin protection against the charging raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the ground. \nSarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it. \nSarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face. \nShe hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away. \nIn the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news. \nThere's no windshield. \nThe raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening -- \n-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT \nMALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door. \nMeeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside, its tail hanging out. \nJust as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim -- \n-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside, through the door again. \nWilling to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the window again. \nINT. GAS STATION - NIGHT \nBalancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches, ready to spring at Malcolm. \nMalcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open between them.  He raises the rifle. \nTh raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges, knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him. \nBut the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window, preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way. \nFor the moment. \nEXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT \nMalcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground. He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun. \nROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes. \nMalcolm scoops them up. \nShe lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on. \nKELLY GET UP! \nShe grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet. \nON THE ROOF, \nKelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS from inside. \nPILOT LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!! \nMalcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the edge as well. \nMalcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five, they're surely done for this time, when -- \n-- KA-BOOM! \nThere comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard, and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the gunshot. \nIt's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his smoking .600 Nitro Express. \nBut there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the roof. \nPILOT HURRY!  THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY! \nThe skid dips even further, ripping right through the thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the helicopter, loses her balance -- \n-- as the roof caves in beneath her. \nMALCOLM KELLY! \nShe falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the building below. \nONE FLOOR DOWN, \nKelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous substance drips off of it. \nIt's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large, oblong shapes.  Eggs. \nAbove her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof. \nMALCOLM Kelly!  I'm coming! \nKelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way. \nIT'S A PTERANODON. \nYep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long, saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only stare, spellbound. \nMalcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls its massive twenty-two foot wingspread. \nON THE ROOF, \nthe helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris. Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and starts kicking at it, making it larger. \nROLAND Give me a ladder! \nIN THE PTERANODON NEST, \nMalcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building, SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the middle of their clutch of eggs. \nAn emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof. Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other and they start to climb out of the nest. \nON THE ROOF, \nMalcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break through the surface of the roof around them. \nThe pteranodons are emerging. \nMALCOLM GO GO GO GO GOG GO! \nThe helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers there. \nPILOT We're snagged on something! \nThey loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest -- \n-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly. \nIN THE HELICOPTER, \nthe PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to the helicopter. \nPILOT Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut 'em with the rotors! \nSARAH NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking! \nThey look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the chopper gains altitude. \nSARAH (cont'd) They're protecting their nest. That's all.  That's all they're doing. \nKelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm, each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags against her father's chest, nothing left. \nHe holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear. \n", "test1_input": "The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten foot tall animal. \nDIETER (cont'd) Now! \nAlmost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it. \nUP ON THE RIDGE, \nNick turns away.  He can't watch. \nDOWN ON THE PLAIN, \na bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat. \nLudlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes glowing. \nThe animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily. Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck. \nA blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air. \nDR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a syringe. \nHe draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and injects it into the animal's thigh. \nCARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo orange. \nDieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of the animal. \nDIETER Next case. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIDGE - NIGHT \nNight has fallen over the island.  The hunters have established base camp in an area they have trampled and cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a central campfire. \nThe vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents. At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen \"capture containers,\" cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they have already rounded up. \nSARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above, looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge. VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING. \nDR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on the cages. \nJUTTSON Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus -- triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus -- or small scavengers only. \nMalcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing something below. \nTHROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS, \nhe sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp, pointing, giving orders. \nON THE RIDGE, \nMalcolm drops the binoculars. \nMALCOLM Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in such a hurry for me to get here.  He knew they were coming. \nHe gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly. \nMALCOLM (cont'd) You okay? \nSARAH (irritated) Heights, I can't help it.  Put your arm here, will you? \nShe puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is close to the cliff edge. \nJUTTSON What do they want? \nMALCOLM They want their money back.  To InGen, this island is nothing more than a bed investment. \nJUTTSON We should get back to base camp. Eddie's waiting for us. \nMALCOLM I can't believe Peter Ludlow's running all this. \nSARAH He isn't.  Check out the guy walking past the fire. \nShe hands the binoculars to Malcolm. \nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS, \nMalcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and equipment slung over their shoulders. \nSARAH (o.s.) I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He and that guy with him were spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was immoral to go after them any other way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats you up with your own argument. \nBACK ON THE RIDGE, \nSARAH (cont'd) He's the one in charge. \nMALCOLM Well, if that's true -- the man in charge just left camp. \nNick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps forward. \nNICK Then this is our chance. \nMALCOLM Our chance to do what? \nNICK I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy. \n", "test1_true": "NICK (cont'd) Nobody has to come with me.  I've done this before. \nSARAH Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger. \nHe looks at her, hurt. \nNICK There' no reason for name calling. \nMALCOLM Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so. \nKELLY What are you guys gonna do? \nMALCOLM (signs) Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT \nIn the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition. PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out. \nEXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT \nIn the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what protest.  Roland looks up. \nROLAND Offering a little incentive. \nLudlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's gun leaning against a tree. \nLUDLOW What kind of gun is that? \nROLAND My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force. \nLUDLOW How close do you have to be? \nROLAND Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down. \nLUDLOW Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill? \nRoland just looks at him. \nROLAND Or a laser beam from a satellite? \nLudlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut with a leather strap. \nLUDLOW You rally think this'll draw the parent? \nROLAND I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill. \nLUDLOW Killing lessons?  Heartwarming. \nROLAND Rex won't be any different.  It'll come. \nLUDLOW You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would -- \nHe stops, an idea on his face. \nLUDLOW (cont'd) Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives... growth inhibitors... \nROLAND What? \nLUDLOW I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me -- (close to the animal) You are a billion dollar idea, my little f- \nCRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut, lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain, clutching his bleeding face. \nRoland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in pain. \nRoland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage is done. \nROLAND What the hell you do that for?! \nAs his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts to cover. \nLUDLOW Had to.  To keep him still for the trip. \nROLAND You've broken its leg! \nLUDLOW We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member? \nHe gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp, trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT \nAt the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart, the tallest almost six feet off the ground. \nNick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm, steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then left alone on the other side. \nHe backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then springs off his good leg -- \n-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two. \nFURTHER IN THE CAMP, \n", "test1_id": 2157, "test2_input": "SARAH Okay, there's the metatarsals -- tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See it?  That's a fracture, just above the epiphysis. \nThey peer closely at the monitor. \nNICK That little black line? \nSARAH That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old. \nMALCOLM Can you set up? \nSARAH (thinking) It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows... \nMALCOLM Think fast, Sarah. \nThe tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again. \nEXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT \nThrough their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared. \nKELLY What are they doing?  Why don't they hurry?! \nEDDIE Give me the radio. \nFrom the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive SHRIEK -- \nOne by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare into the night jungle. \nINT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nNICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin. MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal thrashes again. \nNICK Give it more morphine! \nSARAH We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can -- \nHer eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently. \nSARAH (cont'd) Spit! \nHe spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby rex CRIES OUT again. \nEXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT \nFrom the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR. \nAnd this one's closer. \nIn the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly coming alive, as if brushed by wind. \nBut it's not the wind. \nThey hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide. \nKELLY What is it? \nDr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the walkie-talkie. \nEDDIE Sarah, come in! \nJUTTSON It's moving.  Fast. \nINT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nThere is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer. The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE. \nEDDIE (o.s.) Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?! \nOn the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex, regaining its strength, is thrashing again. \nSARAH Hold it down, Nick! \nNICK I'm trying! \nEDDIE (o.s.) (from the radio) Is anybody there?! \nMalcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him. \nSARAH Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin and fill a syringe!  Quick injection of antibiotics and I can get it out of here! \nForsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty cc's of the pink liquid. \nEDDIE (o.s.) (still from the radio, now desperate) SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME! \nThey ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the injection. \nEDDIE (o.s.) WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW! \nEXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT \nEddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio desperately. \nEDDIE WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION!  I REPEAT -- \nINT. TRAILER - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "MALCOLM Oh, Christ. \nHe bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button. \nMALCOLM (cont'd) Let me talk to Kelly, is she-- \nA deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer, followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look to the window, just in time to see -- \n--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side! \nThere is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside. \nMalcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror. \nThe rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back. \nBut across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS. \nThis one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles anything in the trailer that isn't tied down. \nNICK What do they want?! \nMALCOLM What do you think they want?! \nSARAH That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here! \nMALCOLM Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM! \nNick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a fresh cassette in, and flicks the \"ON\" switch. \nSarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them through the window. \nEXT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nSeen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over, watching their infant. \nINT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nAt the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby. \nSARAH Ready? \nMalcolm reaches for the door handle. \nNICK Wait! \nHe dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door. \nOutside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring, surprised. \nAlthough terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing. \nSARAH (softly) Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows -- \nMALCOLM Are you insane?! \nSARAH I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free -- \nThe baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door shut. \nThe three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they inspect their young -- \n-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter as they move away. \nFrom the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved. \nEDDIE They're going back into the jungle. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT \nEDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the high hide. \nEDDIE Thank God.  Thank God. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio. \nMALCOLM (o.s.) Kelly?  Are you all right? \nShe takes the radio, her voice shaky. \nKELLY Uh huh. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nMALCOLM is at the radio. \nMALCOLM Wait there.  I'll come up in a minute.  Don't move, understand? \nKELLY (o.s.) I understand. \n", "test2_id": 2158, "test3_input": "NICK I think she's with Sarah! \nMALCOLM DAMN IT, BE SURE!! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nKELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only two feet from where she's hiding -- \n-- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of the street. \nKelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nNICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings. \nMALCOLM It's too wide! \nNick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans against the building they're standing on, its lines gone slack. \nNICK Help me push this! \nMalcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far building, THUDDING against it solidly. \nIts power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across the gap, hand over hand. \nBehind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling himself across. \nBut even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out onto the roof. \nON THE OTHER ROOFTOP, \nMalcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again. \nNICK It's afraid to come onto the roof! \nMalcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd, concentric pattern. \nMALCOLM Something's wrong. \nNICK Look!  Sarah! \nHe points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance. Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His face turns white. \nMALCOLM SHE'S ALONE!! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT \nSARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof of the next building. \nShe lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up -- \n-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof ahead of her. \nSarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope, away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor. \nShe looks over her shoulder, down -- \n-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the building below. \nSarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section. \nSarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another. \nThe raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up, at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long. \nDesperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the head, for all the good that does. \nBut Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She edges to the right, toward a fresh supply. \nThe raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the slick roof. \nSomething interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place. Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the way as fast as she can. \nSuddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid the tumbling tiles. \nSarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building, hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the roof, right past her -- \n-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and attack one another. \nNow Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER. She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out of their way -- \n-- and plunges through a hole in the roof. \nINT. LAB - NIGHT \nSarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent light fixture. \nOne end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45 degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES through a window. \n", "test3_true": "Sarah lands in the mud in the street below. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT \nWith a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked, he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT. \nMALCOLM Kelly!  KELLY! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nSARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her. \nSarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the helicopter building, and starts to climb it. \nELSEWHERE IN THE STREET, \nKELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling with fear, unable to move. \nThe whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she looks up -- \n-- into her father's eyes. \nKELLY Dad! \nMALCOLM Come on! \nHe grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street. \nON THE ROOFTOP, \nSarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms. \nNICK Where's Kelly? \nSARAH Where's Ian? \nEyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top speed down the middle of the street -- \n-- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM. \nDOWN IN THE STREET, \nMalcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal. They're pretty fast, but it's faster. \nAbove them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof, SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster. \nThey reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed. \nMALCOLM CLIMB! \nKelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles, pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the next one. \nMalcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's much harder. \nBelow them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts, shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up. \nHigher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles. She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it, running the balance beam. \nShe reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained, breathing hard. \nKELLY DAD, COME ON! \nBelow him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did. \nThe raptor draws closer. \nKELLY (cont'd) FASTER! \nMalcolm slips. \nOne foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing, trying to regain his tenuous balance. \nBut he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest, knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below. \nHe drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him. \nKELLY (cont'd) DAD! \nShe stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six feet above him now, with an open attack route. \nThe animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch. \nUp above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars. \nThe raptor springs. \nKelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very peak of her trajectory, she lets go. \nThe raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it hurtling into space. \n", "test3_id": 2159}

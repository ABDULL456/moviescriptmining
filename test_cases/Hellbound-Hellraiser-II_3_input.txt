They reach the end of the corridor.  It terminates in a T- junction. 
TIFFANY automatically heads in one direction.  KIRSTY makes to follow, but LARRY hesitates. 
LARRY Wait a minute.  Why are we following her? Who is this? 
KIRSTY This is Tiffany 
KIRSTY shrugs. 
KIRSTY ... She's good at puzzles. 
LARRY Fine. 
They take the turn TIFFANY has indicated. 
97   INT  THE KNIFE ROOM 
JULIA still holds FRANK tight. 
Slowly, she raises the hand which holds his heart until it is in front of his face.  FRANK's eyes are glassing over but he can still see. 
JULIA Nothing personal, babe. 
Without ceremony, she bursts the heart with one quick squeeze. 
100    INT  THE CENTRE OF HELL 
LARRY, KIRSTY and TIFFANY come running toward the camera. Initially oblivious to the fact that the corridor they were running along has widened and the walls retreated.  Suddenly, they come to a stunned halt together, staring ahead of them with awestruck faces. 
KIRSTY Oh. My. God. 
The camera moves around them to take in what they see.  They are of course in the central chamber of LEVIATHAN. 
LEVIATHAN is spinning again, the black beams flying around the chamber. 
TIFFANY screams. KIRSTY grabs her. 
KIRSTY Tiffany, listen.  You've solved it. But we've got to solve it the OTHER way.  See?  See? We've got to get out. 
TIFFANY is frozen. 
LARRY Come on! 
LEVIATHAN spins, the beams fly. 
KIRSTY Please!  Tiffany, Please! Get us out!  Take us home, please! 
TIFFANY nods. They are just about to leave when LEVIATHAN stops spinning. 
A large beam flies down , carrying an object which lands on the catwalk before the HUMANS, who all take a step or two backwards. The beam withdraws. The object at first resembles a large and bloody plastic bag, but then internal movement begins to rip at this covering.  Hands appear out of the rips and complete the removal.  We realise that the bag-like thing was a kind of caul, a membranous after-birth that some creatures produce their young in. 
The thing inside completes its escape and stands clear of the shredded caul.  Like a new-born child, it is stained and soiled with amiotic fluids and blood.  But it is not a new born child. 
It is a NEW CENOBITE.  And it used to be MALAHIDE.  The transformation we caught glimpses of is now complete.  Its skin is entirely blue, its head entirely bald.  The decorative wounds and tortures we saw being applied are all present;  its flesh is peeled back in various places, its features are threaded and distorted by, wire, its eyelids are stapled open. 
For a second it stands and regards the HUMANS before it. 
TIFFANY gasps in recognition. 
KIRSTY too knows what it was. 
KIRSTY Malahide ... 
For some reason, KIRSTY draws from her pocket the photo she took from the OBSESSION ROOM. She stares at it. 
KIRSTY Jesus Christ!  Of course ... 
The MALAHIDE CENOBITE stretches its arms and flexes its fingers. 
MALAHIDE And to think I hesitated ...

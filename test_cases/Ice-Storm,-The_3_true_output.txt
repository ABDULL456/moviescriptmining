INTERCUT HALL IN FRONT OF BEN HOOD'S OFFICE 
As we see that Clair is deftly fondling Hood's attractive secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to his office. She looks up coyly at Clair, hidden for the moment from Ben's view. 
Ben comes out of his office, pulling his coat on. Clair and the secretary pull back, but it's clear that Ben has some sense of what's transpiring between them. 
BEN George, I'm just trying to get a global view of things -- can't just look at the small picture. 
There's an obvious rivalry between the two of them. 
GEORGE And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about? 
BEN Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself? 
GEORGE Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist? 
BEN Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top. 
GEORGE Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today? 
BEN Got a meeting uptown. 
GEORGE (already moving off) Right o'. 
BEN Up the organization! (then, to himself) Bastard. 
The secretary pretends not to hear. 
EXT. UNIVERSITY CLUB. DAY 
An august New York institution. To establish. 
INT. CLUB RESTAURANT. DAY 
A stuffy, Ivy League atmosphere. A decades-old tradition of serving overcooked American food. Ben is seated across from his father, Harold Hood, a retired curmudgeon. There is a walker parked by Harold's chair. 
HAROLD (waylaying a passing waiter) I'd asked for that double martini about three hours ago! 
WAITER Coming right up, sir. 
HAROLD So asking me out for lunch -- what prompted this exceptional event? -- Of course I'm paying. 
BEN We don't have to always go to your club, dad. 
HAROLD And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and -- 
BEN -- Well what am I supposed to call you? 
HAROLD That's besides the point. 
The martini arrives, along with Ben's beer. 
BEN I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know -- 
HAROLD Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you? 
BEN You know, dah-- 
He looks up and sees his father slurping his martini, not paying attention. 
BEN (CONT'D) Actually it's not about work, it's advice about -- 
HAROLD Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now -- 
BEN Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but -- 
HAROLD -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought -- 
BEN But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each -- 
HAROLD -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad? (back to Ben) You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice -- 
BEN -- What advice? You never -- 
HAROLD That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 -- 
BEN 
HAROLD -- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.

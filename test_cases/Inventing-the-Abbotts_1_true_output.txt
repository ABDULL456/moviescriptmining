Jacey snorts with incredulous laughter. 
JACEY You're gonna what?

DOUG I'm going to the University of Pennsylvania. I think I'm going to be an architect, too. 
JACEY Like hell you are. 
DOUG Why not? Maybe we can be roommates in Philadelphia? 
JACEY You're nuts. You'll never get accepted to Penn. Besides, Mom couldn't afford it anyway. 
DOUG I'll get a scholarship. 
JACEY I had a four-point-0 grade average and I couldn't get a scholarship -- so, I say you got your head up your ass. 
Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter. Jacey smiles, puts his paddle down, and walks out of the garage. Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits it into the back of Jacey's head. Jacey turns and shoots a perturbed look at Doug -- Doug smiles: 
DOUG 'Night. 
72       INT. WOMEN'S APPAREL STORE (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY            72 (WINTER, 1958) 
Helen looks over the merchandise. Doug absent-mindedly trails after his mother as he studies a large brochure about the University of Pennsylvania. 
DOUG What's 'scenic design'? 
HELEN In what context? 
DOUG What a minute -- it's theatre. 
HELEN Mmmm? (CONTINUED)

DOUG (re: brochure) 'The Howard Lambert Scholarship in Scenic Design for the Theatre.' It's a full ride, four years. Pays everything almost. Hell, I could do that. Just have to figure out what scenic design is. 
Doug looks up from the brochure and comes face-to-face with a mannequin wearing a bra, girdle, and stockings. He almost flinches with surprise and blushes profusely: 
DOUG I'll wait for you outside, Ma. 
73       EXT. LADIES APPAREL STORE (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - MOVIE            73 THEATER - SIDEWALK - DAY (MINUTES LATER) 
It's snowing -- Doug paces to keep warm. He momentarily forgets the cold as he sees Pam and three of her girl friends come out of the drugstore across the street. The girls are in high spirits as they get into Pam's car. 
Two well-dressed townswomen (MURIEL and DORIS) encounter Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out onto the sidewalk. 
HELEN Hello, Muriel... Doris. 
The women pass by Helen with obvious reserve. Helen is seemingly unruffled by their distant responses. She observes Doug as he watches Pam and her friends drive off. 
Helen and Doug walk up sidewalk (towards the movie theater -- the marquee reads: KIM NOVAK -- JEFF CHANDLER -- JEANNE EAGELS): 
HELEN Why don't you drop me off at home and take the car and go out with your friends. Go have some fun. 
DOUG Why don't you? 
HELEN Why don't I what? Go hang out at the Dog'n'Suds?

DOUG No, go out -- play bridge or whatever adults do for fun. 
HELEN I read for fun. 
DOUG You read too much. 
HELEN You sound like your brother. 
DOUG Come on -- let's go see a movie. 
74       INT. MOVIE THEATER (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY                      74 
Doug and Helen share a bag of popcorn as they wait for the feature to begin. 
HELEN Came here on my very first date with Charlie. Saw Rosalie with Nelson Eddy and... not Jeanette MacDonald... oh... Eleanor Powell. 
DOUG Did Dad kiss you? 
HELEN (gives Doug a "look") No. (slight beat) I kissed him. 
DOUG (grins) All right, Mom.

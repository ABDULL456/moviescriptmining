Paul doesn't want her to continue but doesn't want to say so. 
PAUL Any more beans? 
Sethe rises to get him more food and she continues: 
SETHE ...anyway, she points to this mark and says to me "This is your ma'am. I am the only one whose got this mark now. The rest all dead. If something happens to me and you can't tell me by my face, you can know me by this mark"..Scared me so... I couldn't think of anything to say so I said "Yes Ma'am..but how will you know us? Mark me too. Mark the mark on me too." 
DENVER Did she? 
SETHE No. She slapped my face. I didn't understand it then. Not until I had a mark of my own... 
Paul is disturbed. He can see Sethe getting upset. He is mad at Beloved for her damn questions.. 
BELOVED What happened to her? 
Something inside of Sethe stops, a wall erected. Something unwanted is coming into her consciousness. Paul notices it. She rises; 
SETHE Don't know. Everybody done? 
Sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as Paul asks: 
PAUL Well, as long as we're all asking questions, getting to know each other.. (to Beloved) Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself? 
Camera follows Sethe as she arrives at the sink, placing the dish inside. We hear the others O.S.: 
DENVER (O.S.) (defensively) She don't remember nothing. 
PAUL (O.S.) You be surprised what you start remembering once you start talking. 
BELOVED (O.S.) Can I have some more pudding? 
Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the kitchen table. She is staring out the window above the sink as if watching the MEMORY BEING RELIVED IN HER YARD; 
POV - OUT THE WINDOW; 
MEMORY: 
EXT. A LARGE TREE IN A FIELD - A DAY REMEMBERED. 
A CROWD of people surround a tree. SEVERAL WHITE MEN are preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in line, awaiting their turn. 
Among the crowd is A CHILD (SETHE) holding the hand of an OLDER BLACK SLAVE WOMAN (NAN). Nan is pointing to a WOMAN (SETHE'S MOTHER), who is one of the people waiting in line to be hanged. Nan whispers to Sethe: 
NAN That's your mama - right there. 
Little Sethe looks up and sees her mother - her face a mask of courage and rage and tears. She looks straight ahead - not at anyone in particular, especially not her daughter. 
NAN ..I'm telling you, small girl Sethe...Me and your Mama was taken by the men many times..She threw them other babies away..the others from the whites, without names, she threw them away..But you she gave the name of the black man. She had her arms around him, child. The others, she did not put her arms around. Never...Never... 
The child Sethe listens, watching her mother move further down the line. 
END of MEMORY as WE CUT BACK TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - 
Sethe, the memory passing, hears the voices in her kitchen: 
PAUL (O.S.) Ain't you got no brothers or sisters? 
BELOVED (O.S.) I don't have nobody. 
She finds Paul interrogating Beloved who eats a second pudding. Denver tries to interfere. 
DENVER She has us now! 
PAUL You been here five weeks, we still don't know nothing bout you.. 
SETHE Paul, Stop it. Denver bring those dishes. 
PAUL What was you looking for when you came here? 
BELOVED This place. I was looking for this place I could be in. 
PAUL Somebody tell you about this place? 
At the sink, both Sethe and Denver pause, obviously interested. 
BELOVED She told me. When I was at the bridge, she told me. 
Paul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs; 
SETHE Must be somebody from the old days. 
PAUL How'd you come? Who brought you? 
BELOVED I walked here. A long, long, long, long way. Nobody bring me. 
PAUL You had new shoes. If you walked so long why don't your shoes show it? 
SETHE Paul D. stop picking on her. 
PAUL I want to know! Where'd you get them shoes and that dress you had on? 
BELOVED I take the shoes! (coughs) I take the dress! (coughs) The shoe strings don't fit! I... 
Suddenly, she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding and falls backward, off the chair. 
Denver and Sethe rush towards her. Beloved thrashes around until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin. 
She breathes in Sethe's arms as Denver wipes up the mess, glaring at Paul. 
SETHE You all right? 
BELOVED (whispers) I want to go to sleep now. 
DENVER Come to my room. I can watch out for you up there. 
Sethe gets Beloved to her feet. Denver takes her up the staircase to her room - glaring at Paul. 
When the girls have gone, Sethe turns on Paul as she cleans up. 
SETHE What's the matter with you? 
PAUL I don't understand what the hold is. It's clear why she holds onto you, but I just can't see why you holding on to her.

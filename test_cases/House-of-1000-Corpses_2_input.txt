MARY What! 
DENISE Jesus Christ. 
MARY I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack. 
JERRY (Scottish accent) OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality. 
MARY Enough with the stupid voices. 
The brute man attaches the chain to the car and begins raising it with his truck. 
A SIGN on the side of the truck reads FIREFLY TOWING.

CLOSE UP - TV SCREEN 
We are watching a scene from THE OLD DARK HOUSE. GLORIA STUART, RAYMOND MASSEY and MELVYN DOUGLAS are standing in the rain pounding on a huge wooden door. 
GLORIA STUART Knock again louder. 
MELVYN DOUGLAS I should of thought that was loud enough to wake the dead... that's an idea. 
RAYMOND MASSEY What is? 
MELVYN DOUGLAS Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing the people inside were dead. All stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them. 
GLORIA STUART I'm sure it would be very amusing. 
We pull back from the TV to see Bill's clothes drying by the fireplace. Bill, now wearing overalls and a flannel shirt, is sitting on an old over stuffed sofa. 
BILL So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother? 
BABY (speaking from the next room) No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows? 
BILL Um, yeah sure, I guess. 
BABY You sure do a lot of guessing. 
Baby sets down the tray, making sure to bend over close to Bill. She hands him his drink and sits down next to him. 
BILL Thank you. 
BABY You're welcome. 
Baby moves closer to Bill, he begins to get nervous. 
BILL Hey, um... (pointing to the mounted animal head over the fireplace) ...what kind of animal is that? 
BABY A dead one. 
BILL (sipping his drink) Mmmmm, this is tasty. 
BABY (scoops out some marshmallow with her finger) Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. (licks it off) 
BILL I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late. 
BABY Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me? 
BILL What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long. 
BABY Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody? 
BILL That's not something to joke about. 
BABY (rolls her eyes) OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up. 
Finally, the SOUND OF A TRUCK pulling up can be HEARD. 
Bill jumps up and goes to the window. 
BILL Hey, great they're back. 
BABY (sarcastically) Whoopie fucking doo.

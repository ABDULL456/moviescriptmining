He punches up a different sector. The labs, and here is a badly wounded lieutenant. 
PEREZ 
Status! 
LIEUTENANT 
Containment is impossible, sir... I think they swept the barracks. 
PEREZ (to himself) 
A military strike.... Christ Jesus ... 
After a beat, he starts punching in the emergency override codes. 
CUT TO: INT.  BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS 
It's worst here -- the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their sleep, and everyone awake is screaming.  One soldier runs for the weapons cabinet -- an alien hits him from behind and SMASHES him into it, falling in a tumble of guns. 
Over the chaos, the emergency lighting comes on, floor light like an airplane's indicating the nearest exit.  Father's voice is excruciatingly calm: 
FATHER 
Emergency. Initiate evacuation procedures immediately. All hands. This is not a drill. 
One soldier gets a bead on an alien with his burner - fries italong with two of his friends. 
They're out of commission, but the alien is hurt only momentarily.  It bounds forward, takes out his face. 
FATHER 
Emergency.  Initiate evacuation procedures ... 
CUT TO.. 
INT. HALLWAY BY ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The noise is too far above to be heard down here, but Fathers droning voice and the emergency lighting are on. 
Vriess wheels slowly into the hall, concerned.  He spins slowly, checking out his surroundings. 
ANGLE: DOWN THE HALL 
There is nothing.. Just the floor lights pulsing in succession towards the exit. 
Vriess follows their lead, wheeling out. 
CUT TO: INT.  NEXT HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Nothing here either. But Vriess's fur is up -- he moves slowly, carefully. 
And was that a noise?  He looks around, up at the ceiling. 
A drop of alien blood is eating through right above him.  It drips down -- and he rolls out of the way just in time, back up as the blood plops to the floor, eating casually through. 
CUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY ONE - CONTINUOUS 
Men are rushing into one of the lifeboats.  They sit facing each other in the tiny vessel  and strap themselves in.  Pere is here, hurrying the soldiers in, pushing back the few who try to crowd in after. 
PEREZ 
Bay three!  Go! 
The late soldiers make for the next boat as Perez seals the hatch.  He hits the eject button and steps back. 
CUT TO: EXT.  THE AURIGA - CONTINUOUS 
As the lifeboat FIRES out of the side of the giant craft. 
CUT TO: INT.  BAY THREE - CONTINUOUS 
Men crowd into this one too -- it's nearly full and an alien suddenly LEAPS into it.. starts feeding on the men strapped down - they are screaming. 
Perez runs in as a soldier outside the lifeboat fires his burner, hitting the alien, the men, the controls -- a shower of sparks as the alien-turns, about to spring on the soldier as he rolls in a grenade. The doors shut and and a soldier hits the eject button. 
TO: EXT.  AURIGA - CONTINUOUS 
The second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later.  EXPLODES. 
CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS 
The noise of the explosion - and of a few inside as well - is all around the group. 
Father's voice still urges evacuaticion 
WREN 
NO! 
(to Call) 
What have you done? 
CALL 
Nothing.  Not a goddanm thing. You thought you could control it. 
ELGYN 
All right. We make for the Betty. Can he walk? 
He is pointing at Rane, who nods, standing. 
HILLARD  Betty's all the way across the ship! Who knows what's in between? 
CALL (indicating Wren) 
He does. 
One of the soldiers steps forward.  DiStephano. 
DISTEPHANO (to Wren) 
Sir, we have to go. 
(to Elgyn) Let him go.  No quarrel. 
ELGYN 
You can have him when we're off. Not before. 
They start out, dragging Wren along.  Guns still on Call and the soldiers. 
What about Vriess? 
JOHNER 
Fuck Vriess! 
CUT TO INT.  FALL - CONTINUOUS 
Vries enters, looking around.  He is getting seriously wigged. 
The lights on the floor still pulse. Urging him forward.  He obeys. 
Something stirs in the rafters.  Coiled about the pipes. 
Vriess stops, still a good thirty feet from the beast.  Strains to see. 
It starts MOVING, climbing at him upside down on the pipes.  FAST. 
Vriess starts wheeling himself back away but SLOWLY, agonizingly slowly compared to the beast.

SPIDER-MAN Thanks. 
FLASH (realizing) By the way, what are you doing with... Liz? 
SPIDER-MAN She needed a lift. 
FLASH Oh... okay! This calls for a beer! A lot of beer! 
SPIDER-MAN Thanks, but I have some business to take care of. 
FLASH Well... take care of that later. Wait here. I'll get the beer. 
He disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES. 
LIZ (accusatory) How'd you know this was Flash's place? 
SPIDER-MAN Peter Parker told me all about it. 
LIZ Peter told you all about Flash? 
SPIDER-MAN No... he told me all about you. See you later. (he jumps away) 
INT. DORM - NIGHT 
FLASH comes in with more BEER than a man ought to carry. 
FLASH Hey, where'd he go? Hey, Spider-Man!! 
But SPIDER-MAN has disappeared. 
LIZ (distracted) Peter told your Hero all about me... 
FLASH He would, wouldn't he... that jerk! 
EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOF - NIGHT 
SPIDER-MAN lands on it. He drops in the SKYLIGHT. 
INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
He drops into the room and pulls off his MASK. The place has been ransacked. COMPUTER DISCS are all over the floor. PETER pulls a file marked "Planetary Conjunction." He opens it. 
A piece of PAPER falls out. It says, "Kiss it goodbye, Wall Crawler!" 
PETER (whispers angrily) Octavius!!! 
EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY 
PETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself wonderfully. 
PETER (hurrying by) Kim! Have you seen Harry? 
KIM Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac... 
PETER Yeah... have you seen him today? 
KIM No, un unh. 
LIZ (catching up) Peter...! 
PETER (keeps walking) Hi... have you seen Harry? 
LIZ No. What a night, huh? 
PETER (laughs) Yeah, that was some ride home... must have been pretty exciting. 
LIZ It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets to Les Miserables... wanna go? 
PETER Sorry... I'm really busy... I mean, not tonight... see you later. 
LIZ (thinking) Hey, Peter... how did you know about last night...? 
PETER What about last night? 
LIZ My exciting ride with Spider-Man... 
PETER Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to find Harry... I'll see you later. 
LIZ Peter! 
PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it. 
PETER Hey! Can I get a lift downtown? 
FLASH Take your shoes for a walk, Dork. 
FLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward LIZ.

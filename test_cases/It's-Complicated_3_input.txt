JANE (laughs at Adam) Feels perfect. 
ADAM I thought so too. JANE (taking it all in) This is heaven! ADAM It's gonna be cool.    Want to go upstairs? 
43   JANE AND ADAM ATOP SIDE BY SIDE LADDERS                     43 ADAM So if you were lying in bed, this would be your view. 
Jane breaks into a smile. 
THEIR POV - IN THE DISTANCE -- THE OCEAN 
Over this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses, then pushes "IGNORE" and then promptly loses her balance. Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her. 
ADAM You okay? 
JANE (grabs her heart) Yeah.

WATER RUNNING OUT OF A FAUCET 
44   INT. BATHROOM - JAKE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                    44 Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness calling his name in anger. He leaps. 
JAKE Coming! 
Jake quietly UNLOCKS THE BATHROOM DOOR and EXITS to find his path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at him. 
PEDRO What were you doing in there? 
JAKE Going to the bathroom. 
PEDRO The toilet didn't flush. 
JAKE Yes it did. 
PEDRO Why were you in the shower with your clothes on? 
JAKE (making sure Agness doesn't hear) What are you talking about? 
PEDRO I heard the shower door close. 
JAKE What do you have, x-ray ears? 
Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking through. She holds a broom. 
AGNESS What's up Pedro? 
PEDRO Jake took a shower with his clothes on. 
JAKE Pedro!    Darling... AGNESS What's he talking about? 
JAKE I don't speak Pedro.   That's your department. 
AGNESS (to Pedro) Don't go in the kitchen, P, I broke something. (to Jake, annoyed) Yo. Can you help? 
Agness EXITS back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake.

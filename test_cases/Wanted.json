{"train": "WANTED \nWritten by \nMichael Brandt & Derek Haas \nFADE IN: CLOSE ON the face of WESLEY GIBSON, 25, STARING AT THE. \nCAMERA. \nWESLEY (V.O.) Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic. His wry smile gives way to... Black. And then... \nINT. APPLEBY'S - DAY \nThe CAMERA STARTS FROM THE CEILING, pointing straight down, overlooking a table of twenty-five people dressed in business casual, pretending to have a good time at lunch in. this cookie-cutter crappy restaurant. At the end of the table, a bowl of spinach dip is in. front of Wesley,'and the CAMERA STARTS descending directly for it, slowly, as we hear... \nWESLEY (V.O.) It was Rochelle's birthday, which meant there was a certain amount of inter- office pressure to go to Appleby's and sit at a table of twenty-five with my boss Janice presiding at the head even though she's too tight to pick up the bill. Which meant, the poor bastard waiting on us had to split the check twenty-four ways -- everyone contributing to Rochelle's free meal -- surf and turf, no less -- don't do us any favors, Rochelle. Anyway, I ate a plate of extreme nachos and then polished off a bowlful of spinach dip pretty much single- handedly... The CAMERA DISAPPEARS in the bowl of spinach dip and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY \n.where Wesley drops his head down on his desk. \nWESLEY .so by the time I got back to my cubicle, my eyelids were so damn heavy, I had to put my head down, even if it was just for a wink. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nA sharply dressed man, MR. X, wearing a dark .Armani suit, enters a skyscraper through the lobby. He's a shade taller than most of the office workers who are coming and going. \nINT. LOBBY - DAY \nHe heads to an elevator and presses a button for the top floor. And as his finger presses the button, just where the thumb meets the forefinger, we see a TATTOO of a three- headed dog. Soon... \nINT. TOP FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY \n.the doors open again and he finds himself in an opulent corridor -- sleek and expensively designed. Only one office is at the end of the hall. Expressionless, he makes his way toward it. Without knocking, he steps inside... \nINT. PUJA'S OFFICE - DAY \n.an office fit for a king. Or a queen. Because behind a glass desk sits a beautiful Indian woman dressed traditionally in a serape, with a red bindi on her forehead, the holy third eye. Her name is PUJA. Mr. X sits in the single chair opposite her. After a moment, Puja looks up. \nPUJA I didn't expect for you yourself to come. One of the heads, in the flesh. \nMR. X You're an important fence. \nPUJA I'm flattered. She reaches over to an attach\u00e2\u0082\u00ac case and removes a file. \nPUJA (CONT'D) The name of the target is Henry Helms. Carrying the file, she moves around the desk and stands a few feet away from Mr. X, who rises so that they are both standing. She really is quite beautiful, exotic even,. with piercing eyes. \nFOX And killing all three heads gets him that? Sloan nods again. \nFOX (CONT'D) Well, I don't know if we have anyone who can stop him. Sloan squints back up at Fox. \nSLOAN There's one person who can. \nFOX Yeah? Who? And with that, we... \nSMASH CUT TO: \n7 INT. WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY \n.Wesley Gibson, the guy from the opening scene, fast asleep in his little cubicle. Some drool falls off his lip and 'erks h' awake. Just then, the shot FREEZE-FRAMES, and we see IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE SHOT, his fat boss JANICE caught in mid- stride coming toward him, looking like she's ready to bring the wrath of God. \nWESLEY (V.O.) My name is Wesley Gibson. If you look at the corner of my desk, you'll see the billing reports I was supposed to hand in to Janice an hour ago. The BILLING ORT is highlighted on the screen for just a moment. .then the movie RESUMES normal speed and Janice reaches Wesley's cube in no time... \nBOSS JANICE Oh my fucking god I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your fucking desk. Holy shit on an altar, it isl A couple of the other OFFICE WORKERS look up at the fireworks and smile... like they're actually enjoying Janice's histrionics. \nBOSS JANICE (CONT'D) why don't you just take a dump in your hands, fork it over to me and say, \"this is the best effort I'm gonna give to you, Janice. This is the best you're ever gonna get out of me.\" Hell, Rochelle on her bbirthdav is doing a better a job than your lazy ass and she's already left for the day. Je-sus CHRIST! Wesley looks like he'd rather be anywhere else. \nWESLEY I meant to... \nBOSS JANICE (imitating him) I meant to... I meant to... Well I meant to be a size four but meaning to doesn't pick no cotton. \nShe snatches up the report off his desk. \nBOSS JANICE (CONT'D) Tell you what. I'll just input the four- ones myself. \n(ANNOUNCES) Look everyone, I'm gonna do Wesley's four- ones for him! I don't have enough to do with my own damn job so I'll do Wesley's too! Wesley grabs the report back. \nWESLEY I'll do it. \nBOSS JANICE Minimum for the maximum. That's all you ever do. The minimum you can do to suck the maximum from this company. \nWESLEY I said I'll get it done. I'm sorry. \nBOSS JANICE No, you're worthless. I'm the one who's sorry I hired you. She storms away, fuming. Wesley looks over and sees some of the other workers still staring at him, amused. He sits back down to the semi-privacy of his little cubicle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MEETING ROOM - DAY \nA CONSULTANT in a suit is droning on and on in front of a nifty power-point presentation. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Wesley, bored to tears, sitting at a long table with Janice and other corporate minions. The CAMERA FINDS Wesley's note-pad where it looks like he's taking notes on the presentation. Instead, covering every inch of the page, is the phrase \"life sucks then you die.\" \nWESLEY (V.O.) My job title is Account Manager. I used to be called an Account Service Representative, but a consultant told us we needed to \"manage\" our clients and not \" service- them. Onemore \"life sucks then you die.\" \nWESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D) I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GIRLFRIEND'S APARTMENT - DAY \nWesley presses the down button and waits. \nWESLEY C'mon, c'mon. After an eternity, the doors open. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) But at least at the end. of the day... Wesley steps in and turns around. Before the doors close, he sees his boss Janice down the hall, looking at him. She checks her watch and looks back at him, pissed... \nWESLEY (CONT'D) \n(DEFEATED) .you know that tomorrow it's going to start all over again. ..and then the doors close. \nEXT.. CITY STREET - DAY \nWesley pedals a ten-speed down a busy street. It's raining, and he squints to keep the water out of his eyes. \nEXT. ATM MACHINE - DAY \nHe stands nervously at an ATM machine. He checks to see if anyone is looking, and then hits the \"check balance\" button. A message comes up: \"You have $47.92 in your account. Would you like another transaction?\" He clicks \"yes\" and then \"quick cash\" and waits for the $40 to dispense. \nIN . WESLEY'S APARTMENT - DUSK Wesley enters, toting his bike, only to find Cathy and Barry laughing on the couch, watching some crap on television. He's two steps in the door when... \nCATHY Where's the spaghetti? \nWESLEY What? \nCATHY I specifically told you to get noodles on your way home. God, Wesley, I already put the sauce on. \nWESLEY Sorry. I\u00e2\u0080\u00a2didn't... \nCATHY You didn't listen is what you didn't.- I might as well talk to the wall. \nWESLEY I'll be right back. He turns around. \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE WESLEY'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nHe starts to head away when Barry pokes his head out of the apartment door. \nBARRY \n(INSINCERELY) You want me to go with you, buddy? What a dick. Wesley doesn't turn around, defeated... \nWESLEY I got it. \nEXT. CITY STREET - DUSK \nHe's back on the ten-speed, pedaling again in the rain,.a pissed expression on his face. \nWESLEY (V.O.) My parents both died when I was born. He grits his teeth as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOSTER HOME - DAY \nFOX ,Your father died two days ago on the rooftop. of the Metropolitan Building. For a moment, just a moment, Wesley is stunned, but Fox just keeps sizing him up. \nFOX (CONT'D) He'd be damn disappointed in what you've become, too. Wesley holds up his hands in a defensive gesture... \nWESLEY Lady... \nFOX I've been called a lot of things, but \"lady\" ain't one of 'em. Wesley starts to talk but Fox interrupts him... \nFOX (CONT'D) Damn, Wesley, how d'you ever learn anything when you won't keep your mouth shut and your ears open? I'm trying to tell you about your father. Wesley starts to open his mouth again, but then closes it. He waits. \nFOX (CONT'D) Your father, Wesley, wits the great\u00e2\u0080\u009e sit assassin to ever live. Your father, Wesley, worked for the Fraternity. \nis. \nWESLEY The Fraternity? \nFOX (keeps right on going) Your father, Wesley, was set up and gunned down by a man he used to consider a friend. And your father, Wesley... Suddenly, s raises her hands and-LS fist' two blgck \nPISTOLS. \nFOX (CONT'D) .taught me everything I know. Wesley takes a step back. \nWESLEY \n(SLOWLY) What is this? \nFOX This is what you've dreamt about all your life. Just then, Cross o s the corner to t e' e also fisting a Da'r of alms. Wesley's eyes go wide as Fox suddenly starts firing, BAM! BAMI BAMZ BAMI BAM: forcing Cross to take cover on the far side of the aisle. \nFOX (CONT'D) Move! Now! She screams this, grabbing Wesley's wrist and jerking him forward, just as Cross comes back up, firing, a killing machine. They barely get out of the way, as the pasta aisle explodes in an avalanche of bullets! Glass bottles of spaghetti sauce shatter, turning the aisle into a rainstorm of red droplets -- we're not sure what is sauce and what is blood. Then... Cross springs on to a display stand of tortillas and up to the top of the freezer section, so he can have a better angle of attack at the fleeing Fox and Wesley. He starts sprinting down the top of the freezer section, smashing over styrofoam coolers, as his bullets barely miss Fox and Wesley, but slam into the freezers behind them, sending ice and glass exploding everywhere. \nBut Wesley and Fox are too quick.. She still has a.hold of Wesley's wrist and she propels him through the swinging doors of the stock room. \n-EXT. OUTSIDE THE GROCERY STORE - DAY \nThere is a cherry red FERRARI convertible parked right next to the store. Wesley is still trying to figure out what the hell is going on as Fox tosses him the ke ! \nFOX Drive! \nWESLEY What?!! But Fox just leaps into the passenger seat, guns up and ready, as Wesley's legs. somehow take over and he hops behind the wheel. Just then, Cross's ev ll Mound the corner, practically going up on two tires. Wham! Wesley turns the ignition, pope the clutch, and smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck when it launches forward. He races through the gears and rips around a corner and out into traffic. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Where are we going? \nFOX Just drive! The Chevelle stays on his tail behind them; Cross drives and fires his Glock at the same time. Bam! Bam! Sam! Fox does her best to send bullets back his way, while Wesley mans the wheel, breathing hard, still stunned at what is happening. He spots a side-street... \nWESLEY Hold on! ...whips the car into a rubber-squealing turn... \nEXT. ONE WAY STREET - DAY \n...and ends up going the wrong way down a narrow one-way street! He now has to weave in and out of cars headed right for them, as Cross stays tight on their ass. Horns are BLARING in his face, but Wesley somehow keeps the. Ferrari on all four tires as he bobs in'and out of the paths of oncoming cars. A 4 X 4 Chevy Pickup is headed like a missile right at them... Wesley's eyes go wide. \nWESLEY Truck! \nTHE BUTCHER We all end up where we belong, don't we? The Butcher snickers. Sloan speaks up... \nSLOAN Fox told you about your father? Wesley looks from Sloan to Fox to the Butcher and back to Sloan. \nWESLEY \n(STAMMERS) Like I told... um... the lady here... I think you might ha ve me mixed up with someone else. I'm just an... um... account serv... uh..that is... account manager... and... my father died... He hesitates. \nSLOAN When? They look at him, imploringly, waiting for an answer. \nWESLEY I... I guess I'm not sure. Sloan simply picks up one of the pistols and sticks the gun in Wesley's hand. \nSLOAN Shoot the wings off the flies. \nWESLEY What?! \nSLOAN \n(GROWLS) Shoot... the wings... off the flies. For. the first time, Wesley notices flies buzzing all around. \nWESLEY I don't... In the blink of an eye, Sloan has plucked the second gun off the rolling table and ',s -pointing it at Weslev's temple. He begins to count... \nSLOAN You have three seconds. Three... two... Before he can say one, Wesley reacts... blindly firing the pistol in his hand, indiscriminately, B,AM! BAM! BAM! BAM! CLICK...CLICK...CLICK... until his finger is just jamming on the trigger over and over. After a moment, he looks up, unsure why he isn't dead. \nSloan smiles, drops his pistol on the rolling table and picks up the magnifying glass. He stoops down and signals Wesley to do the same. \nTHROUGH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS: Four flies lie on - the floor. crawling o d... their wings actually separated from their bodies! \nIN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE: Wesley jerks upright, trying to process this. \nFOX Like I said, you got the skills. \nSLOAN And after we fine tune those skills... His eyes lock on to Wesley's, holding them in a vice-like grip... \nSLOAN (CONT'D) .you're going to hunt the man who killed Your father. Wesley is as stunned as we've ever seen him... he blinks a couple of times. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Walk with me. He drapes his arm around Wesley and leads him out the door. \nEXT. CITY BLOCK - DAY \nSloan and Wesley move down a busy commercial street. \nSLOAN I know thin is hard for you to understand, Wesley, but I want you to concentrate on what I'm saying. Your father was a member of the Fraternity, a collection of the most powerful assassins the world has ever known. They weave against the flow of pedestrians out and about on the city streets. Instinctively, people step out of their way. \nWESLEY But I've never heard of... \nSLOAN We don't advertise Wesley. We blend into the environment like moths against a tree. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. PHARMACY - DAY \nSloan and Wesley enter a normal looking pharmacy. They pass through the small front room and head directly to the back. \nSLOAN We have been active for centuries, Wesley... outlasting rulers, governments, nations, kings. We recognize no borders; the entire globe is our killing field. They are buzzed through by THE PHARMACIST, and enter... \nINT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY \n.a sophisticated back room, where a trio of flat screen monitors are mounted on the wall. \nSLOAN We are the baddest of the bad, the three- headed dog that guards the gates of hell. We show no mercy, we destroy the weak, we have absolute power. \n(BEAT) But recently, a fallen angel, one of our own, has challenged that power. The screens in the room come to life with the face of Cross. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) This man left the Fraternity and decided to strike down those who had befriended him, trained him, made him who he is. \nSLOAN (V.0.) ..a son whose mother died in childbirth... They reach the baby's bed and a pair of strong arms lift up the child. But the CAMERA FINDS the face of the second man... \nSLOAN (V.0.) (CONT'D) ..he took the boy to an orphanage so his true identity would never be discovered. .and now we see that the other man is a YOUNG MR. \nSLOAN. \nSLOAN (V.0.) (CONT'D) And I helped him. \n'INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY \nWesley is still absorbing the story, his life so different than when he got up in the morning. \nWESLEY Why would you do that? Sloan puts a hand on Wesley's shoulder, gently. Paternally. \nSLOAN Your father was like a brother to me. \n(BEAT) I will do anything to avenge his death.' Sloan turns off the monitors and pulls over a wooden chair from where it rests by a wall. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) So Wesley... you have a choice. Would you like to go back to your job, your girlfriend, your life, just as it was before? \n(BEAT) Or would you like to begin your training with an assassin's Fraternity that writes the world's history in blood and bullets? Wesley doesn't know what to say. Sloan moves to a back door . \nSLOAN (CONT'D) If the answer is the latter, then have a seat in that chair. \n(MORE) \nSLOAN (CONT'D) \n(BEAT) If not, you're welcome to head out this door here and we'll never see each other again. With that., Sloan leaves through that back door. But... \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR: He stops. He pulls out a gun and waits for Wesley to make his decision, pointing his gun at the door. \nBACK IN THE ROOM: Wesley is still standing there, unaware of what is on the other side of the door, thinking, thinking, thinking. He takes a step toward the door... FLASH: His boss Janice, yelling at him, mocking him. Wesley hesitates, looks at the chair, then the door again... FLASH: His girlfriend on the couch, riding high on Barry, loving every minute of it. Wesley stands frozen, staring hard at the chair as THE CAMERA STARTS to swirl around him. FLASHES: The consultant haranguing, the other employees laughing, eating.alone in the break room, riding his bike, all the aspects of his shitty life... .. as the CAMERA CONTINUES to swirl around him, his face going hard... \nFOX (CONT'D) All right, find us some skinny bitches. Wesley uncovers the first body... it's a. black male. \nFOX (CONT'D) Nahh, let the brother rest. Find us some white meat. And nothing too fat. Wesley covers the black male and moves over to a second body. He unveils it to reveal... what looks like a dead suburban housewife. \nFOX (CONT'D) Perfect. Load up soccer mom. \nINT. TARGET ROOM - NIGHT \nFox and Sloan stand next to a paper target -- the kind of thing you see in a police target range. It shows the outline of a head and torso with concentric rings for where you're supposed to aim. The Gunsmith hoists the corpse of the dead soccer mom on to a hook that hangs ten feet in front of the paper target. Sloan flips a switch and a motor takes the mom and target to the end of the range. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Wesley is with them standing in one of those firearm booths at the opposite end of the range. \nSLOAN Selecting your weapon and then disposing of it is the most pivotal aspect of every assassination. An array of firearms are on a shelf next to Wesley. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Pick one. Wesley eyes all the weaponry. Finally, he settles on a short-barreled black handgun. Sloan takes it from him and inspects it. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Excellent. This is an Imanishi 18. It holds seventeen bullets in the clip and one in the chamber. It's made of a composite material unrecognizable by metal detectors. \n(MORE) \nSLOAN (CONT'D) And the Imanishi's bullets have microchips that communicate with similar ones in the gun. \nWESLEY Computer chips? \nSLOAN \n(NODS) Sometimes the closest distance between two points is not a straight line. What if soccer mom here is between you and your target? \nWESLEY I suppose you're going to tell me to shoot her first. \nSLOAN How'd you do in Physics class? \nWESLEY Mostly B's. Fox cocks her head at Wesley, knows he's lying. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Okay, I got a D. \nSLOAN Why? \nWESLEY I couldn't remember all the rules -- \nSLOAN That's it. Rules. What if I told you there weren't any? He nods at Wesley, like he's on to something. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) People live by the rules set before them. We take them on faith that they are right. But how many times in your life have you thought you had a better way, against-the rules that was simply laughed at. \nWESLEY Every day. \nSLOAN Because you use your brain differently than other people. All Fraternity members do. \nWESLEY I don't get it. \nSLOAN Humans use neurons to think. But most people can only handle a small percentage of those neurons firing at once without suffering a seizure or an aneurism. Not us. And not you. We have the ability to think differently than other people. \nWESLEY So we set our own rules. \nC WESLEY (CONT'D) What was my father like? For a moment, she thinks about it. Then... \nFOX Come on. \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nThey walk down a downtown lane, buildings crowding in on them from all-sides. Not too many people are out this late; they have the sidewalk to themselves. \nFOX Your father lov ed you, Wesley. He talked about you all the time. \nWESLEY Really? Wesley looks at her hopefully. She smiles, thinking about the past. \nFOX That's a fact. He knew he wasn't supposed to, but he couldn't help it. \nWESLEY You worked with him? \nFOX \n(NODS) He trained me. Made me what I am. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK \nA younger, greener Fox stands alone in the alley, eyes scanning the rooftops. \nFOX (V.0.) I remember one night he had me on my own .for the first time, and I was tagging this target named Buster Burgess. But I was green and clumsy and stupid. Buster marked me and disappeared into this old tenement building. \n(-. EXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP - SAME - FLASHBACK \nA shadowy figure creeps to the edge of the building and looks down. We can't quite make out his face. Fox is looking the other way and he's got a clean shot. He raises a rifle to his eye... \nBAM! He nails Fox in the thigh, and she falls helpless to the pavement. \nFOX (V.0.) Motherfucker shot mein the leg. Put a damn hole in my favorite skirt. The figure re-aims, ready to take out the helpless Fox. \nFOX (V.0.) (CONT'D) Then you know what happened? \nWESLEY (V.0.) My father saved your life? Put a bullet in Burgess? k, \nFOX (V.0.) Naww. I ended up with four more slugs in me. The figure unleashes four more shots. \nBACK TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nThey turn a corner and head up into the lobby of a tall building, their conversation continuing... \nWESLEY What kind of training is that? \nFOX I'm here, aren't I? \nFOX We cremate our dead. I'd like to say it's to honor them, but it's mainly to keep anyone from identifying them after they're gone. \nWESLEY These are my father's ashes? \nFOX Yeah. \nWESLEY Sloan said his heart stopped but there was no entry wound? \nFOX That's right. \nWESLEY Can I have a minute? \nFOX Sure. She leaves and Wesley approaches the urn holding his father's'remains. He runs his finger over it, and just when we think he's going to have an emotional moment...' ..he smashes the urn on to the stand, the ashes spilling out everywhere. Wesley runs his fingers through the decay: what a mess... there are pieces of bone intermingled in the cremains. But then hisfingegs find something in the dust... a BULLET with a hole running down its center. He holds it up to the light for a closer look. As he studies it, we start to hear... WHAM! WHAMI... \nINT. SMALL ROOM - DAY \nWHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Wesley site with his hands tied behind his back, taking another beating from The Pharmacist, who spouts assassination techniques while he pummels Wesley. \nTHE PHARMACIST If you get in the hoo-ha of a two on one and find yourself the one, remember that each foe will likely move at the same steady speed away from each other, allowing you to keep a gun on each. \nWHAM! WHAM! \nTHE PHARMACIST (CONT'D) Now, if you find yourself one ' on three, that poses a real bit a' ball ache... \nThe sound of the Pharmacist's voice fades to the background as Wesley's voice-over comes up... \nWESLEY (V.0.) There are two kinds of pain. One is an object. A living thing that crawls around the outside of your body. Cuts, broken bones, bruises... all deliver the kind of pain you can learn to ignore, and they soon disappear to nothing but the sound of a gnat in your ear. Wesley's eyes are starting to lose consciousness. \nWESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D) I've lived with a different kind of pain all my life... the kind that comes from two decades of being passed over, pushed around, ignored. But you can't hide from that kind of pain either... Wesley takes a brutal shot to the face. \nWESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D) .because it finds you. He involuntarily spite blood as his eyes roll back in his head. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nSloan sits across from Wesley at a skinny table in an otherwise bare room. \nSLOAN Watch the eyes. Look for a slight swelling of the pupil. You can train your body to stay a constant temperature, you can control your heartbeat, but you can't control the center of your eyes. That's how you know when someone is lying to you. Sloan looks right at him. Wesley narrows his eyes, trying to fend off his stare. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Do you want to fuck Fox? \nWESLEY No. \nSLOAN I know that's a lie without even seeing your eyes. \nWESLEY Fine. Try something else. \nSLOAN Okay. What are you hiding from me? Wesley looks down, then focuses on Sloan. \nWESLEY Nothing. Sloan waits. Wesley realizes it's useless to try to keep something from this man. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center... places it on the table. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) You told me to hunt down my father's killer. That's what I'm doing. \nThe color red appears sporadically throughout the entire model city: on the sides of buildings, on mailboxes, on some of the manhole covers. \nWESLEY What's with the red ones? Sloan just smiles... .and THE CAMERA MOVES TO HIS FEET, then PUSHES'IN on one particular street on the map, further in on one RED STREETLIGHT and we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \n.the s city street, now full-sized, buzzing with activity, pedestrians hurrying to work, cars and taxis and trucks whizzing through the street. Sloan and Wesley walk down the sidewalk, passing streetlight after streetlight until they reach one in particular. \nSLOAN The Fraternity's grasp reaches every facet of the world's major cities, including their construction. Look at this streetlight. Wesley peers at it... there is a plaque affixed to the pole... the standard thing you find on these things... \"Municipal C. W. 63070.\" But then there is something different on this one... a tiny symbol on the bottom of the plaque... the Cerberus instead of the seal of the cit Sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside, revealing a hollow space behind it. He reaches his hand inside and pulls out a small handgun... flips out the clip expertly, then racks the weapon. Wesley can't believe it. \nWESLEY You have stashes... \nSLOAN .everywhere. \nWESLEY Jesus. \nJust then, two POLICE OFFICERS walk by, eye.the gun Sloan has pulled out. \nPOLICE OFFICER Sir... Sloan flashes his tattoo at them. \nSLOAN Keep moving, fellas. They nod and do just that. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) They let us do our jobs, we let them live. THE CAMERA PUSHES IN on Wesley's face as he realizes the full scope of this organization and we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSERIES OF SHOTS: GUN RANGE. Wesley firing his Imanishi 18 on the shooting range, steering the bullets wherever he wants them to go. \nWESLEY Closer. Impressed, the Gunsmith moves the corpse closer to the target, making the angle all that much tougher. Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol starts FIRING next to him. He looks over... Sloan is standing nr= &o him, firing at the target. Every shot bends around the body and hits right in the forehead of the target. Wesley smiles, impressed. LIBRARY. Wesley thumbs through an old Fraternity book, which has detailed sketches of an assassination in 17th century Paris. MEAT LOCKER. Wesley working out on a heavy bag, honing his punches, the Chef holding the bag for him, muscles rippling. MAP ROOM. Wesley walks by himself amongst the miniature city, trying to memorize where the red marks are. \nINTERROGATION ROOM. Wesley sitting here,. being grilled by Sloan, as he tries to-tell the undetectable lie. \nSLOAN Our job isn't just about how fast or true you shoot, Wesley. Physical agility will always lose to mental agility. It's warfare of the mind. FO 'S APART. Wesley looking at Fox through the bedroom door. SLAUGHTERHOUSE. Wesley working with the Butcher on the art of knife play. MAP ROOM. The Gardener and Fox show Wesley the rooftop of a certain building on the model city, one corner of the roof painted red. ROOFTOP. Fox and the Gardener now with Wesley on that actual rooftop, pointing out firing angles, modes. of ascension, and escape routes. The Gardener moves over to a cornerstone in the roof of the building and then easily lifts it off, revealing a stash of assault rifles. k SHOOTING G . Wesley looking at some ammunition while the Gunsmith talks and demonstrates. He fires at one of the targets, which EXPLODES in a splattered mess and we cut to... \nINT. FOX'S PENTHOUSE - MORNING \nFox making coffee as Wesley sits, studying the binder, his mind racing. \nWESLEY Cross and my father were tight. But Cross thought he should be one of the heads of the Fraternity so he left and vowed to kill the three heads. Which means my father is dead because of petty jealousy. \nFOX More reason for Cross to die. Wesley flips to the picture of cross. \nWESLEY But I don't see jealousy in those eyes, do you? Fox walks over and slams the binder shut. \nFOX Listen .to me, Wesley. In two weeks, we have to kill Henry Helms. Do-you know who that is? \nWESLEY The journalist who's got a price-tag on his head. \nFOX A price-tag that we're going to collect. Your father was meeting with a fence about the job when Cross took him down. So we can only assume Cross knows about the target too. We... you... have to take Cross out before we prosecute this mission. We can't have him out there as a wildcard, wreaking havoc, do you understand? \n(WHAM!) FIVE!! (WHAM!!) ..he pulls his arms tight, and his muscles start to twitch and bulge -- muscles we didn't know he had until. now -- and as he continues to take punches, WHAM!, WHAM!, WHAM!!, the rope strains against the wooden chair, and we can HEAR the wooden legs start to pop, until... CRACK!!! Wesley Jerks his arms ee and comes swillcrincr with the broken of leg of the chair. SMASH! SMASH!! The Pharmacist goes down hard and Wesley stands over him, out of control,. furious, SMASH! SMASH!, beating him with that broken chair leg. The CAMERA PUSHES THOUGH one of the walls... \nOBSERVATION ROOM: .. to where Fox and Sloan are watching Wesley pummel the pummeler through a one-way mirror. \nSLOAN He's ready. the los2k on Fox's face becomes more and more and sexual until... \nINT. FOX'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \n..she leans on top of Wesley, straddling him on too of her bed. They unleash on each other, and from the looks of it, Fox makes Cathy seem like a nun. \nFOX Don't you quit now, baby! Don't you quit now!! Wesley didn't know it could be like this. After they finish, Fox gets up and heads to the shower and he watches her go the whole way. In the doorway, she turns around... \nFOX (CONT'D) Sloan says you're ready. \nINT. TATTOO ROOM - DAY \nWesley site in a chair as Fox crouches next to him with an advanced tattoo machine, inking his hand. \nWESLEY Do you like being the only chick in the Fraternity? \nFOX \n(COYLY) Who said I was the only sister? Maybe you just haven't met any others yet. Wesley laughs. \nWESLEY (playfully back) Maybe I have and I'm just not telling you. \nFOX \n(GRINNING) Hold still. He settles down. \nWESLEY How did you end up here, Fox? \nFOX Same way you did, sugar. They found me. \nWESLEY What did you do before? Fox looks at him, a wry smile on her face. \nFOX Sold perfume. At the mall. \nWESLEY No shit? \nFOX No shit. \nWESLEY I can't see it. \nFOX Get in line. \nWESLEY What made them come after you? I mean, I know why I'm here. \nFOX Fraternity members all have something in their lineage that shows they'll be good at this. \nWESLEY And yours is? \nBARRY Wesley... hey dude. Wesley can't believe itl \nBARRY (CONT'D) Thanks for calling me. I wanted to say... Wesley pulls out his gun and Barry throws up his hands... \nBARRY (CONT'D) Whoa, man!! But now we see Wesley is looking past B_arry. over his shoulder... \nWESLEY Get down! .and he's looking at a man we recognize from his office... The Consultant. He's approaching rapidly behind Barry, fisting a 'pair of pistols! Just as Barry hits the deck, Wesley pulls the trigger... .but it lust CLICKS, the chamber empty... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nTHE PORSCHE: Fox holds the clip to Wesley's Imanishi, tapping it in her hand. Holy shit, she gave him an empty gun... \nSMASH BACK TO: \nTHE OUTDOOR MALL: Wesley can't believe his gun is empty. In the split- second that it takes him to realize this, the Consultant has his guns leveled, taking aim, but... \n...Wesley moves faster than we thought he could move... he darts behind a kiosk hocking monogrammed apparel, and dashes full speed through the crowds lining the street. The Consultant chases after him, knocking shoppers out of the way, sending fanny packs and Nordstrom bags flying. Wesley hooks a right around a SHARPER IMAGE and heads straight down a narrower section, like he's on a mission, knowing exactly where he's going. And now we see why... Because the city around us goes stark white like the Mg Room. We're seeing what Wesley sees, what he's memorized in all those hours staring at the model. Finally we see one SMALL BENCH next to a fountain, which is bright red. Immediately the natural color of the city c2 Ws back and Wesley is running all out for that bench. He goes into a slide, hitting the grass .underneath the bench, sliding under it, popping up on the other side. He rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does, revealing an AUTOMATIC PISTOL... .and just as quickly, he's up on one knee, aiming, using the bench as a shield as the Consultant rushes up, surprised and BAM! BAM! BAM: The Consultant drops where he is, three bullets hitting him in his two shoulders and his chest. People start SCREAMING and RUNNING the hell away from the gunplay. Wesley is about to run away himself, but when he turns, Fox is right there beside him... smiling. A couple of SECURITY GUARDS are with her, smiling as well. Wesley looks over at The Consultant, who site up, smiling too, even though he's bleeding from three spots on his body... \nFOX Pin shot bullets. Wesley looks down at the gun. \nWESLEY Just like my father used on you. Fox nods, as the Security Guards go to help the Consultant to his feet. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) You were watching me in the office. \nFOX \n(NODS) Protecting our assets. She hands the clip from the Imanishi over to Wesley... \nFOX (CONT'D) Time to do this for real. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LONG CORRIDOR \nWesley and Fox walk down a long hallway toward a single doorway. They open it, revealing... \nINT. SLOAN'S OFFICE - DAY \n. a large office with a single desk and a roaring fire. Sloan turns from the fire to greet them. He holds up the \"mole\" bullet, and smiles. \nSLOAN The mole bullet is made by a midget t Filipino named Pek War. His fingers are so small that they can shape and smooth the metal better than anyone. \nWESLEY You've known all along. You knew before I ever broke the urn... \nSLOAN I had to let you figure it out for yourself. \nWESLEY Part of my training. \nSLOAN Part of your quest. To get to know your father. \n(BEAT) And his killer. Wesley nods, a grave expression on his face, like he knows what he is going to do next. \nCROSS (CONT'D) Look into my eyes! Wesley's finger is starting to squeeze his trigger... as is Cross's. \nCROSS (CONT'D) (growls, in pain) Look into my eyes, goddammit! \nFinally, Wesley does and his face goes slack as he sees himself reflected in Cross's Dupils. Just then, Fox pulls up in the Porsche about fifty yards away, and her headlights illuminate them. Cross shifts his eyes to her, then does a curious thing: he lowers his gun, then drops it to the ground. Wesley can't believe Cross would leave himself defenseless. Moving swiftly, Cross men tucks something into the Rocket of Wesley's hooded sweatshirt. \nCROSS (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERS) Everything they told you was a lie, Wesley. With that... Cross falls down. His black jacket spills open to show a gun shot wound not just to his shoulder, but to hig n too. one of Wesley's bullets through the train must have found its mark. Cross is bleeding profusely. He gasps a couple of times... then, with his last bit of energy... \nCROSS (CONT'D) Find the missing piece. And... don't... let them... dispose of the weapon... With that, the life goes out of Cross's eyes. Wesley stares at that face, trying to decipher some meaning there. But Cross just stares blankly back at him, just as Fox comes limping up. \nFOX You did it, baby! Son of a bitch, you did it. You put down motherfucking Cross! Wesley looks down and sees some of Cross's blood on his hands from their clench. There is also some on the gun he is holding. ar --h d ed crun. Wesley reaches down and takes the other pearl-handled gun from where it dropped and looks over them both. \nFOX (CONT'D) What'd he say to you? Wesley looks up, sees some sort of anticipation in Fox's eyes. He looks back down at Cross's body.. \nWESLEY He said... he said 'pies on the Fraternity...' Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the whole story. Finally, she nods... \nFOX Well... damn, I couldn't be more proud of you, baby! Let's go lay this on Sloan! \nWESLEY Yeah, sure. \nFOX What's wrong? \nWESLEY I think I need.a minute to myself. \nFOX \n(UNDERSTANDING) Sure. It's your first kill. I'll wait for you... \nWESLEY Naah, that's all right. You need to get stitched up. I'll meet you at that Korean place. \nFOX You sure? But he's already walking off. She watches him go, thinking... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nWesley walks down the street. PEOPLE instinctively get out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk. Then he pulls out what Cross slipped inside his pocket: a beaten-up copy of COUNT OF ONTE CRISTO. In fact, there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid. Wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the cover... printed on the inside in a steady hand are the words: \"I left you something.\" Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a Harley at a curb. He bee-lines for the guy. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING \nWesley now blazes down the highway, pushing the Harley to its limits. His angry expression hasn't dissipated. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING \nThe Harley pulls up to a lower-middle-class house, the kind you might find in any run-down suburb. Kids run around the neighborhood, playing. \nON THE BIKE: Wesley sits and looks at one particular house. He climbs off'and heads to the side of the house, still carrying his book. \nSIDE OF THE HOUSE: He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down the side of the house... .until he finds a familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar because we've seen this place before: it's where he lived when he was a foster kid. He removes the board, then reaches into the hole. His hand seizes on something. From the hole, he withdraws a KEY attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North Highbury St. Wesley's eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the key, and back to the book. Finally, he lowers his hands... revealing a little eight- year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back yard. \nWESLEY (V.0.) 60 During his life, he was said to have killed over four hundred bears and was the pride of this small community on the Rhine. You want to know how he died? A pair of black bears singled out his house from the entire village, mauled his wife, killed his twin daughters, and then lied in wait for him to get back from the woods. \nINT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - LATER \nThe fire is out, but it has blackened the inside of the joint, so that it looks like an absolute war zone. Fox is in the same position as when Wesley shot her, but there's a sheet of paper folded on her chest. The Butcher and the Pharmacist flank Sloan as he approaches the body, frowning. \nWESLEY (V.0.) When the hunter opened the door, they ripped his throat out before he could scream. \n(MORE) \nWESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D) The two bears then curled up on the rug LW in the middle of the floor -- the rug that had once been their father -- and proceeded to bite. each other till they bled to death. Sloan reaches down and picks up the paper, and sees beneath it that pearl-handled revolver. The one with the blood on the handle. \nWESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D) That's a true story. He unfolds it, to read printed in black ink on the paper: \n7'HE GATES OF T.T ARE OPEN Sloan folds the paper back up and looks at the blood on the gun. \nSLOAN He knows. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE ROOM - NIGHT \nWesley stands in the slaughterhouse, holding two pistols, looking around. The place has been cleaned out. There's no sign of the Butcher. \nINT. PHARMACY - NIGHT \nSame thing at the Pharmacy, an empty store now... \nINT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \n.and in the Fraternity's library, nothing. All the books are gone... Wesley processes this, frowning. He keeps walking to the... \nMAP ROOM: .where the entire model city has been destroyed, like a Giant has trampled it beneath its feet. Wesley stoops over and pulls one smashed building out of the mess, looking at it, thinking, thinking... .and then he's up and moving quickly. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CROSS'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAnna opens the door for Wesley, who looks like he is on to something... \nWESLEY My father... he was working on a plan, right? \nANNA I don't know. There was so much he wanted to keep away from us... Wesley moves into Andrew's roan... where the boy is still playing with the black model buildings. Wesley moves over and crouches down next to Andrew. \nWESLEY Can I see that for a second? The boy hands him the building in his hand. It is painted jet black, except for one corner of the first floor, which is painted red. Wesley looks up at Anna. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Do you know where he got this? \nINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT \nAnna leads Wesley down some wooden steps into Cross's basement. Sure enough, the entire floor of the basement has been made into a model map, similar to the one that the Fraternity used in the map room, but all the buildings are black, with an occasional red mark. The scale is larger, the model shows only one section of the city, and a BLUE LINE indicates a route through the streets. And on the wall are PICTURES and CLIPPINGS of Henry Helms. Wesley squats over it, trying to figure out what his father's plan was. He sees a missing place for a building and puts Andrew's toy back in place, then studies the map some more. \nWESLEY (playfully back) Maybe I have and I'm just not telling you. .and now with the gift of hindsight, we see that Wesley meant what he said, and we... \nSMASH CUT BACK TO: \nINT. NICOLE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nWesley still stands there, just a few feet away from her. \nWESLEY Sloan didn't just have one person in my office watching me, he had two. \nNICOLE What are you talking about? \nWESLEY What name do you go by? The Intern? He points at her tattoo. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Because I know you have the mark. Nicole's face changes, goes hard, like someone flipped a switch. Like lightning, she grabs for a butcher's knife but Wesley is faster. He pins her wrist back, twisting until she drops the knife. She lunges again, but a pistol comes up right below her chin. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Where's the Henry Helms hit going down? Where's Sloan? \nNICOLE Sloan's not your biggest problem, fuckface. \nWESLEY Yeah? Why's that? She reaches over, slowly, so he knows she's not going to go for a knife... and she turns on a small TELEVISION sitting on the kitchen counter. The screen comes to life, showing an inf mercial for the F ob'e. Nicole shakes her head and. flips up the channels... and now we see what she wanted to show him... \nON THE NEWS: Wesley's EMPLOYEE PHOTO fills the screen above a reporter's head while the REPORTER babbles in a serious voice... \nREPORTER .responsible for several recent shootings, including one tonight at this Korean restaurant downtown and another at an outdoor mall. Details are sketchy, but we repeat, if you see this man, please contact... \nIN NICOLE'S KITCHEN: She starts cycling through the news channels... ...and each one shows. different REPORTERS standing outside the smoking bar-b-que, or talking about Wesley, or speaking with police. One is even interviewing Wesley's old boss, Janice, who is very happy for the forum... \nON THE NEWS: \nJANICE He was aggressive toward me and other employees... a very negative person, extremely negative. I can't even repeat the words that came out of his mouth the day we let him go... \nIN NICOLE'S KITCHEN: \nWESLEY Motherfucker. Dispose of the weapon... \n(BEAT) Me. \nNICOLE That's right. And the cops were told to watch this place too. You have nowhere to go. He's smarter than you. He'll feed the cops evidence singling you out for every hit the Fraternity has pulled in the last ten years. \nWESLEY (ignoring her) I'm only going to ask you one more time. Where can I find him? \nNICOLE You won't get to him. You can't. The cops will be here any second! Wesley reaches over- -and cranks up a gas burner, the menacing flame on high. \nWESLEY Then this is going to get painful quickly. She stares at that blue flame, fear in her eyes for the first time. He starts pushing her head toward it, closer and closer... \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Henry Helms. Where is it going down? The first SCREAM from Nicole is lost in... \nTHE FRONT DOOR: \nBAM. BAM BAM! \nHOSPITAL. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOFTOP - DAY \nA guy looks down at the street with his binoculars. It's the Gunsmith! \nTHE GUNSMITH (into a radio) Nothing yet, sir. \nEXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - SAME \nOn another tall building, Sloan talks into a radio. \nSLOAN Hold until I give the word. He clicks off the radio and looks into his palm, where- e's holding that pearl handled aun, fingering the dried blood. \nON A CITY STREET: The suburbans and cops flank the limo as it rolls through the concrete jungle. \nIN THE LIMO: The bodyguards peer up at the buildings ready for anything. Henry Helms reaches over and grabs his wife's hand, a reassuring gesture. But his white knuckles betray his trepidation. The driver watches as they reach a frontage road on the east side of the river. \nON THE ROAD: They make a turn along the river and haul ass toward the bridge. Traffic is sparse and they look like they have an easy clear passing. \nON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP: The Gunsmith sits, waiting patiently... \nON ANOTHER ROOFTOP: Sloan watches the Limo starting to approach the bridge. \nSLOAN (into the radio) Here comes the car. Any minute now. Take your positions. Sloan leans out over the edge of his building, gun ready. \nQUICK SHOTS: On the hospital roof, the Gunsmith puts down his binoculars and picks up a rifle. The Pharmacist leans over the edge of a building and looks down, high-powered rifle in his hand. On another building, the Chef does the same. And on still another building, the Gardener also gets ready. Each killer is in a different spot and has a gun, pointed and ready, just waiting for the signal... \nON THE ROAD: The limo is about halfway up the incline now, a sitting duck, hellfire about to rain down upon it. \nON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP: The Gunsmith waits, waits, waits... .and then, out of nowhere, surprising the hell out of him, a knife is held to his neck from behind. The Gunsmith doesn't even so much as swallow, as the blade is so tight against his throat that it draws a drop of blood. \nGUNSMITH \n(NERVOUSLY) Wesley? The CAMERA MOVES TO THE SIDE to show Wesley crouched right behind him, a look of icy determination on his face as he holds the knife in place. \nWESLEY \n(GROWLS) The name is Cross. In the distance, the Helms limo moves on, safely. \nWESLEY Looks like you missed your chance. Now where is Sloan? The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley's voice. \nGUNSMITH You don't understand, man. This ain't about Helms. The Intern told you right where to go... He smiles. \nGUNSMITH (CONT'D) .I'm just the decoy. THE CAMERA WHIPS around behind Wesley... to show that three laser sights are lighting up his back in a perfect pattern. And now we see it, this was al a Bet-up to get Wesley in the open. The three surrounding rooftops, slightly more elevated, hold each of the three assassins crouched-in sniper positions, zeroed in on Wesley's back. But instead of surprise, Wesley just leans in closer to the Gunsmith's ear. \nWESLEY \n(WHISPERS) She told me that, too. And with that, he rolls the o0 over of , just as the assassins on the higher rooftops all unleash a hail of bullets. BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! The Gunsmith takes a dozen shots, all in the chest, but none of the bullets make it through the Gunsmith's body. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Should've studied your anatomy, fellas. Wesley FIRES BACK indiscriminately at the neighboring rooftops, lying on his back, using the.dead assassin's body as a shield. \nWe've seen this place before. It's the same roof where cross took out the second head of The door is kicked open and Wesley walks out, eyes blazing. Sloan is waiting for standing t feet away, holding his father's pearl-handled gun, trained right on Wesley's head. \nSLOAN Can't say I don't have a sense of irony. The place I first decided to bring you in. Wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) You once asked why I helped hide you as an infant... It gave me power, Wesley'. Power to become a head of the Fraternity. Power over your father. And ultimately it gave me you: the perfect weapon to kill your father. \nWESLEY But now you have to dispose of the weapon. \nSLOAN In some ways it pains me to do so. You 460 are like the son I never had. \nWESLEY Fuck you. Sloan's eyes narrow. \nSLOAN Fine. Keep your worthless dignity. You're still just the same loser we plucked off the street six weeks ago. Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in. Sloan laughs derisively. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) You can't win, Wesley. The Fraternity is everywhere. Even if you kill me others will come from other cities to take my place. You'll be hunted your whole life. \n(BEAT) But that's not gonna happen. Like I told you before, when we are called, death is as certain as the sun. Wesley stands as straight as he can muster. The two men face each other like two gunmen on Main Street in Dodge city... an old newspaper even blows through like a tumbleweed. And we are close on Wesley's face. act it i the same shot from the opening of the movie. \nWESLEY Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic. We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve... \nWESLEY (CONT'D) But not today. With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun, the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they both open fire... .Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan does the same. Just like he did with h' father. .But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took the knife. \nWESLEY (CONT'D Uhhh! He can't raise his arm, it's useless, but he's come too damn far to stop now... he flips his gun from his good hand to his bad hand and manages to keep FIRING! Then Wesley does something unexpected... he starts sprinting straight at Sloan, still knocking his bullets out of the air... He closes the gap... ten feet... five feet... ..a surprised and worried expression now spreads on Sloan's face,.like what is this kid doing? But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots the gun out of Sloan's hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his feet! They go flying right over the edge of the building. Wesley's able to grab on to a railing cable and stop himself... ..but Sloan is going to go over. At the last moment, Sloan reacher. for-something. anything. and grabs one-handed the barrel of Wesley's gun... For a moment, they dangle there in this precarious position, looking each other in the face. Sloan can't believe he's been bested by this kid. \nSLOAN \n(SNARLS) Go ahead and shoot me, killer. Just like you did your old man. Wesley's finger starts to squeeze the trigger, but then he smiles... \nWESLEY I'm done with this life. Just like my father. And with that, Wes1gy drops the n out of his h \nFROM TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW: We watch Sloan's body fall through the sky... \n..down, down, down... .until it SMASHES into the sidewalk, splattering like a grapefruit. \nON THE ROOFTOP: Wesley rolls over on to his back, looking up at the darkening sky. \nWESLEY (V.O.) It's true. Six weeks ago I was ordinary and-pathetic. Just like you. He sits up, moving OUT OF FRAME. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nThe place is now blanketed with cops, looking at the dead bodies, trying to make sense of what happened. \nWESLEY (V.0.) But I've learned something in that time. I've learned about the man who made me. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN CORNER - DAY \nCope stand on the street, handing out pictures of Wesley, asking pedestrians if they've seen this man. \nWESLEY (V.O.) I've learned about the man I am. \n", "test1_input": "(SHEEPISH) I... uh...I got hit by a man much bigger than me. Nicole smiles, flirtatiously. \nNICOLE Was this over a girl? \nWESLEY Something like that. \nNICOLE I had no idea you had such a secret life outside of here. She cocks her head and studies him. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Is there something different about you? Besides the... face? \nWESLEY No. Not really. Same old Wesley. \nNICOLE I don't think so. She puts her hand on top of his; he can only stare at it... this kind of thing just doesn't happen to him. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) You aren't like these people Wesley. I've always thought you were different. \nWESLEY Would you consider me to be an observant person? \nNICOLE What's that mean? Wesley's about to say something, when he spots Janice heading their way. Wesley nods at her and Nicole frowns. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Uh-oh, here comes the wicked bitch of the west... With that, she steps away, just as Janice walks up. Wesley stands to face his boss, as Janice launches into him... \nBOSS JANICE Jesus H. Fucking Popscile, you don't have time to get me the differential responses but you got time to chitty-chatty with the intern? Why do I even keep you around, Wesley? Well I know one thing, your review is coming up next week and I can't wait to start checking me off some boxes... attitude: poor, performance: poor, management skills: poor, works well with others... Wesley just focuses on that mouth. Fat lips over fat gums over yellow teeth. But now all that's coming out of it is JIBBERISH. ' I Jibberish that goes straight from her larynx to Wesley's ears where it imbeds in the soft flesh of his brain and BURNS... It's so goddamn loudl if only... ...if only it would just... \nWESLEY \n(ROARS) \nSHUT THE FUCK UP11!!1111 It's so unbelievably stunning coming out of Wesley's mouth that it hits Janice like a slap in the face. Heads all over the office start to poke out of the tops of their cubicles like gophers coming out of holes. Nicole watches, pleasantly stunned, from a few feet away. Janice looks around, shocked. Wesley likes the way that felt, so... \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Just because you have one single iota of tenuous power, you think you can push everyone around? \n(MORE) \nWESLEY (CONT'D) .I understand, Janice, that junior high must have been particularly difficult being called Tubby all the time, but that doesn't give you the goddamn right to treat your workers like horseshit. Sure we laugh at you behind your back and sure we know you keep a stash of jelly doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk... Janice looks down at her fingers, which still have a little grape jelly on them... \nWESLEY (CONT'D) .and sure everyone takes their lunch an hour before you so we can get an extra hour away from you, and I know that must sting sitting by yourself in the White Castle parking lot every day gnawing on your third burger thinking up ways to humiliate us... Janice's eyes fall to her feet. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) .you know, if you weren't such a bitch, we might actually feel sorry for you. As it is, I feel I can speak for the rest of the office when I say... FUCK YOU!!! With that, he throws all the papers off his desk, sending them flying! Empowered, Wesley marches toward the elevators as everyone watches him go, admiration plastered on their faces. The loudmouth from the break-room steps out... \nLOUDMOUTH That was great dude! He holds up his hand for a high-five, but Wesley just WALLOPS him with a right cross, not breaking stride on his way to the elevators. \nEXT. OUTSIDE WESLEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nWesley flies out the front door, just as Fox's Diablo swings around the corner. \nFOX What's up, new man? \nWESLEY You were watching? \nFOX Never stopped. How'd it feel, saying exactly what you wanted to say? \n", "test1_true": "INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE ROOM - DAY \nThey return to the butcher shop. Sides of beef hang from hooks next to a cutting table. The Butcher is sharpening a knife. \nFOX You need to get used to the blood and the muscle and the meat and the sinew and what a single blade of steel can do to a chunk of flesh. The Butcher turns and slices a chunk of tenderloin off of one of the hanging carcasses, then slaps it on the table. \nFOX (CONT'D) Take care of him, Butcher. \nTHE BUTCHER Will do, Fox. The Butcher measures Wesley, then starts to talk in a steady, almost bored voice... \nTHE BUTCHER (CONT'D) Remember, it's the body we are killing. Know it like a surgeon. Wesley nods, half disgusted, half enthralled. \nTHE BUTCHER (CONT'D) Okay, we'll start at the beginning. To cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice-pick style and thrust down behind the clavicle, cutting side to side. He jabs the blade into the beef... and just as he does... \nFLASH - PARKING GARAGE: .we smash cut to a BUSINESSMAN walking to his car just as the Butcher comes up behind him and performs the exact same move he was just demonstrating. Just as quickly, we... \nFLASH - BACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE: .and the Butcher performs the next move... \nTHE BUTCHER - To slice the diaphragm, first whip your wrist into the target's trachea to prevent screaming, then drive the knife at a forty-five degree angle upward just below the rib cage. Just as the knife hits the side of beef, we smash cut to... \nFLASH - LUXURY HOTEL SUITE: . a DRUG KINGPIN coming out of his hotel bathroom wearing a bathrobe. Suddenly the Butcher is on him, performing what he just described on this poor bastard, who can no longer scream because he's missing his trachea, and just as quickly... \nFLASH - BACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE: .we are right back to the hanging side of beef as the Butcher performs the next move... \nTHE BUTCHER If you want the jugular, pull your enemy's head to the left and jab your knife well into his sterno-cleio- mastoideus muscle, here, then cut down and left. Just like before, we smash cut to... \nFLASH - DIRTY ALLEY: ...a MAN moseying down an alley, carrying a briefcase, when suddenly, the Butcher comes out of nowhere, pulls the enemy's head to the left and then WHAM!, jabs the knife into the neck, matching the move-he was just demonstrating. \n7 FLASH - HACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE: The butcher continues to hack away at the hanging meat, describing more and more ways to kill with a blade... \nWESLEY (V.O.) They never show you this shit on the McDonald's commercials. .. as the CAMERA FINDS Wesley, who is completely absorbed in the lesson. The Butcher hands him the knife, and Wesley starts to make his first chops at it, wanting to please the Butcher, wanting to get it right... \nEXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - NIGHT \nFox is seated at a small outdoor cafe, sipping on a latte, reading the paper. There's a story about the death threats to Henry Helms on the front page. Just then Wesley approaches, his face splattered with flecks of blood. She wipes his face with a napkin. \nFOX You haven't quite figured out this whole \"blending in\" thing, yet. Let's go. \nEXT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nA huge Chevy 4X4 pulls up and Fox hope out from behind the wheel, followed by Wesley. They get to the door and Fox pulls out a metal device to pick the lock. \nWESLEY What is this? \nFOX This... She picks the lock and they step inside... \nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nthe empty morgue examining room. Empty except for a d d ozen dead b s laid out on slabs, covered by white sheets. \nFOX This is the Roach Motel, Wesley. Wesley looks around, disgusted. \n", "test1_id": 33, "test2_input": "WESLEY (CONT'D) So my question is... how do I find Cross? Pek War's eyes go wide, pleading... \nPEK WAR \n(DEFENSIVE) My clients use middlemen, I don't meet them in person, I know so little about them... Wesley twitches the handle just a bit. \nPEK WAR (CONT'D) Okayl Okayl Dammitl God damiaitl I'll tell you! \nWesley lets up a little bit. \nPEK WAR (CONT'D) Prearranged meets. Fox snatches up a nearby phone. \nWESLEY. Start prearranging. \nEXT. CITY STREET -NIGHT \nThe Porsche once again tears across the asphalt, as Wesley drives. \nFOX Wesley, you gotta know something. No matter what kind of training you've done these last few weeks, killing your first, well that's gonna change you forever. Wesley drives for a while. Then... \nWESLEY You know what my foster mother. told me when I was six years old? Fox shakes her head. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) She caught me eating some jello out of the fridge after my bedtime. I knew I wasn't supposed to but I was so damn hungry, and it was just some fucking jello. Anyway, after she hit me so hard I couldn't bite down straight for a week, she told me... she told me that God had killed my parents because I was such a wicked boy. \nFOX Jesus. Someone needs to find that bitch and set her straight. \nWESLEY So I grew up thinking I was the reason I never knew my parents. But now, to find out, that no, my father didn't give me up because he had died... he gave me up because he was Protecting me... well I guess I want to give him something back. \nFOX Here we are. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT \nThey are surrounded by industrial looking warehouses, one of which has the words Times-Herald on it. Newspaper delivery TRUCKS make their way in and out of the loading dock area of this building. Overhead, an EL TRAIN scrapes along the worn tracks. Fox pulls around a corner and back into an alley, so they can have a view of the corner in front of them. Wesley scans the area quickly. \nWESLEY Not very discreet, are they? Fox smiles knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley is talking about. On various rooftops we-see FIGURES peering down. looking over the site. \nFOX The others are only backup singers. This is your show. Fox subtly moves her head and figures disappear, crouching down. Just then, out the windshield, they see a MAN wearing a long black overcoat approaching the corner near the newspaper building. Fox's eyes start to dance. \nFOX (CONT'D) Remember: he's good, baby. But you're the best I've ever seen. Wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car. \nIN THE STREET: From a distance, Wesley approaches Cross from the back. His steps become quicker, getting closer every passing second. Wesley starts to reach in his coat for his gun... .and that's when Cross firesl Quick as lightning, Cross has guns out and lets loose toward the roof of a nearby warehouse. \nHis bullet has the instincts of a bird dog, and it curves over the edge of the building and finds its mark, causing a crouching ASSASSIN to plunge from the roof to the street near Wesley! The others on the rooftops hail down bullets as Cross disappears into the nearest building, the Times-Herald. Wesley and Fox run toward the building as three other Fraternity members beat them there, the BELLMAN, the WAITER, and the ELECTRICIAN. Wesley sees them congregate on the loading dock and then start inside the building... \nWESLEY No! The minute Bellman exposes himself in the open loading dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the dock. Wesley and Fox join the other two on the dock as screaming WORKERS run from the place. \nWAITER We need a way in there. \nELECTRICIAN Let's find another door. \nWESLEY He'll be long gone by then. \n", "test2_true": "WESLEY On the pallet. They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching on the pallet on the front. \nINSIDE THE NEWSPAPER BUILDING: Once inside... \nWESLEY Separate. The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await. \nWITH THE ELECTRICIAN: The Electrician hustles between the pallets and boxes, eyes darting, guns drawn. He backs up to a pallet of stacked newspapers, using it as cover. What he doesn't realize is that between each stack of papers is a space, just big enough for a -- THWAP! A bullet finds its way through the space and hits the Electrician in the back of the shoulder, spinning him around. CLOSE ON: Cross' gun. Another shot and we follow the bullet, across the dock and dipping low into the next space in the paper stack -- right where Electrician is now leaning... .the bullet buries in his eye, sending him to the flog. Wesley sees Cross race for a set of stairs. Just as Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden beam holding back some massive rolls of NEWSPAPER. The rolls tumble over and Wesley has to dive out of the way, allowing Cross to escape up the stairs. Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs. \nON LEVEL TWO: Giant printing machines are running full speed, printing up the morning edition. A group of NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES see the guns the Fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety. Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring machines... \nWESLEY (to the Waiter) Stay here and cover us. There's no angle for him to hit you if you stay here. Wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the machines. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Don't let him get up there. And stay clear of the presses! He'll use them however he can. \nWAITER How do you know? \nWESLEY It's what I'd do. With that, Wesley and Fox disappear amongst the machinery. The Waiter takes a step back from the press, where over a hundred pounds of paper spins through every second. He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that scaffolding. Everything looks clear, until... ...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans of spray lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal, until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it to explode! The burning oil covers the Waiter, who SCREAMS and stumbles nearer the printing press... \nBAM BAM BAM! More shots from Cross and one of the RESTRAINING ARMS on the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in half. The paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a. saw, cuts the Waiter in hplf ! With a leap, Cross is on the scaffolding over the presses. For just a second, Cross stops as he locks eyes with Wesley... ..but Fox is already firing at him so Cross has to keep moving... He heads up a second staircase, but not before he sends a stream of bullets back at Fox, who athletically cartwheels away... .but one of Cross's bullets disintegrates a gear on the press near her, sending flying metal everywhere. A piece of shXapnel b ies into Fox's leg... making her break out of her cartwheel and flop down, wounded. \nFOX Fuuuucckkk! Cross races along the scaffolding and disappears into a door. \nFOX (CONT'D) Keep goin', baby! Take him! Wesley races for the stairs. He is the only one left to chase Cross to level three. \nON LEVEL THREE: Wesley bursts through the door, guns ready. The place is already in pandemonium, with PEOPLE yelling and screaming and running for cover. Quickly, Wesley realizes he's in the business offices of the paper, and it looks surprisingly similar to his old office. Lame-ass cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere. Wesley jumps up on a desk. \nWESLEY Cross! Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at Cross... who immediately returns fire... .and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE. The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each other from sharp angles... Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck, but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man using the same techniques at the exact same time. Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the words \"Action Items\" written on it. He fires at it, and his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!! Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby window, smashing the glass out, \nWesley doesn't hesitate behind him... he sprints for the same window and dives through it, guns at the ready and... \nOUTSIDE THE WINDOW: .we stay with Wesley as he falls from the third floor, firing his guns the whole time... .until he lands top of an \"L\" train moving at ll speed. \nTHE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT: Fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to the Porsche. She ignores her wounds and rips the car out of the alley, chasing after the fleeing L train. \nON THE L TRAIN: Ahead of Wesley, Cross is also on the top of the train. He manages to get up, spin around, and fire at Wesley... .but they both have to duck as the L train whips under an overpass, which misses smashing both of them by mere inches. Cross takes the opportunity to swing down between cars and enter one of the L cars. \nBEHIND HIM: Wesley hurries across the top of the train, spying the trail of blood that Cross is leaving behind from his wound. Wesley smiles, a shark on a wounded baby seal, as he also swings down between the cars and enters... \nTHE FIRST L CAR: .where he sees the trail of blood leading all the way down the center of the empty car and out the back door. Wesley hovers in the entry way, his guns up and ready. He takes a step forward to follow the blood trail, and immediately, he is decked from the side by an ambushing Cross. They tumble over the first row of seats, both losing their guns. \nWesley kicks Cross off of him, but Cross-spins with two new suns in his hand! Wesley is.on him quick though, and SLAMS Cross into one of the train's windows hard enough to crack it. With a quick twist of Cross' wrist, Wesley takes a sun from him Just as Cross kicks h,m off... .Wesley fires as he falls backwards. Cross falls backwards too from the momentum... ..and they both smash out opposite windows of the train before landing on either side of it! \nEXT. DIRTY ALLEY - NIGHT \nBut the amazing thing is... they stand up and keep firing as the cars are whipping by at 80mph, and realize they. are timing their shots to actually blast between each car in the s it-second the opening passes. \nON THE TRAIN: COMMUTERS ride along in blissful ignorance, reading their papers, holding on to the handrails... completely unaware of the gunfight raging outside the train. A bullet whizzes through an open window, pierces a BUSINESSMAN'S paper, and exits a window on the opposite side of the car. The man sticks his finger through the hole, unaware of the battle outside. What the hell? \nIN THE ALLEY: On opposite sides of the train, Wesley and Cross are both sprinting and firing, trying to get to the end of the last train, while dodging each other's bullets... .as the last car passes, they each jump on the tracks, ending u with guns tucked under each other's chin! \nCROSS Wesley! This takes Wesley aback... \n", "test2_id": 34, "test3_input": "CUT TO: \nA LONE KEYHOLE in a solid closet door. Wesley sticks the key in and swings the door open revealing a LONG BLACK COAT, just like his father's. \nANNA I guess it's not much of an inheritance. \nWESLEY \n(STEELY) He left me more than this. Wesley takes the coat and folds it over his arm. \nANNA I want you to know that he forgave you before you ever pulled the trigger. He tried to keep you out of it for so long... \nWESLEY Why didn't he just tell me? \nANNA once they had you... he couldn't risk it unless you were alone. He knew his one shot at telling you might be his last. Her eyes harden a little bit. \nANNA (CONT'D) You have to finish what he was doing, Wesley. It's the only way any of us will ever be free. Especially your brother. They won't stop hunting us... your father knew that. Wesley nods. \nWESLEY I'll be back as soon as this is over. \nANNA You have family here. Wesley nods, these words meaning so much to him. \nINT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - NIGHT \nFox eats in a small restaurant in the heart of Koreatown, the kind of place that has the hot hibachi grills on the S table tops. \nThe place is mostly empty, quiet, with mainly Korean faces both dining and serving. It's the kind of place where you can eat and not be bothered. The doors swing open and Fox looks up. The silhouette of e I URE IN THE DOgJLWM is disturbing, a familiar person in a long black coat... \nFOX Jesus. She squints, the setting sunlight nearly blinding her as all she can see is a silhouette... \nFOX (CONT'D) For a second there I thought you looked just like Cross. Wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table as Fox lights up a cigarette. \nWESLEY Skipped the hospital? \nFOX He picked me clean and I don't care much for needles. She blows out a lungful of smoke and watches as it rises toward the ceiling. \nFOX (CONT'D) Sloan's on his way. One of the waiters waves to her to put out her smoke and she just stares him down. The man backs off, nodding and smiling. \nFOX (CONT'D) You want something to eat, baby? \nWESLEY I'm all right. \nFOX They got some good shit. Ostrich, chicken... won't fill you up too much if you're watching your calories. \nWESLEY Naah. \nFOX Well, the big man should be here any minute... \nWESLEY Yeah. \n(BEAT) Listen, can I ask you a :question? \n", "test3_true": "WESLEY Did you know Cross was my father? \nFOX What? \nWESLEY Did you know? Closer, closer... tight on those pupils... \nFOX \nO AW What're you talking about Wesley? Cross killed your father. \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP: We see her pupil swell, just a tiny bit. \nKOREAN BAR-B-QUE: He saw it... exactly what Sloan told him to look for when someone is lying. And from the look on Fox's face, she knows he saw it. \nFOX Goddammit, Wesley... She stabs out her cigarette, crushing it on the hot grill so that it SIZZLES. \nFOX (CONT'D) Why'd you have to ask me that? With that, she kicks back from the table, holding a huge black Smith and Wesson revolver. \nWesley only has a millisecond to respond,-and he does by kicking over the table, which sends food and utensils flying, but also shields him from Fox's bullets. Just as quickly, Fox leaps up on top of one of the other tables, trying to keep her heels on the sides so that her feet don't touch the hot grill. If she's wounded, we wouldn't know it. Wesley does the same on a nearby table. They take shots at each other as they leap from table to table, avoiding the sizzling centers, but they're both so quick that no bullets find their mark. Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously fast. She's like the animal she's named after, and she launches off one of the tables... .and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a form tackle on to a table... ..where he lands Quare on the oven top... PSSSSBHH... and his guns go flying across the room as... .the table to starts to burn through his clothes! \n%AW \nWESLEY Arrrh! \nFOX You shoulda known better, baby... But he rolls over, taking Fox with him, and now the oven- is burning into her back. With all her strength, she bucks him off and then flips herself backwards off the table. With another kick, she sends the hot table flying at him. It rips free from its wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas out into the restaurant... SSSSSSSSS... Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not before it burns his arm as he blocks it. Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a hailstorm of bullets. But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor Pete Rose style, sliding to a stop at the precise moment where his hands come u holSling his weapons. In.one fluid motion, he flips back over and EAM! BAM! \nBAM! BAM! BAM! \nshoots bullets up in the air and then flicks his wrists so they arc over at the open gas nozzle! The bullets strike it, sparking, and then BOOM!!!: fireball b sts from nozzle, while a great Riume of sweltering fire keeps pouring out! Fox dives to get out of the way, which gives Wesley the opening he was looking for. He FIRES again, and one of his bullets knocks her crun away and another nicks her in the side of the face. She stops, seeing the blood drip down her cheek and off her chin. This only seems to enrage her. Pissed, she produces two S R GUNS out of the small of her bac -- where she had them hidden we have no idea -- and charges Wesley like an unleashed Pit Bull... \nFOX (CONT'D) \n(SCREAMS) Aaaaahhhh! She's firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks this time, knocking Wesley's guns out of his hands from where he lies flat on the floor. She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless... .and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face bleeding, both gun barrels pointed right at Wesley's face... \nFOX (CONT'D) I gotta admit, baby... She starts to squeeze both the triggers... \nFOX (CONT'D) I thought we might have a future... But, Wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she reels... In the same motion, he grabs her wrists and pulls her toward him... taking her guns right out of her hands like a quick-change artist. Flipping them over, Fox's face full of surprise is the last expression she'll ever have because... \nBAM! BAM!!! \nMost of Fox's face is blown clean fr her head, and a blood mess s ra s a oss the wall. Wesley leans his head back and closes his eyes, the spume of fire flickering brightly against his lids, the events of the last several hours washing over him. \nFADE OUT: For several moments, there is nothing but darkness and a silence as permanent as death. Finally... \nWESLEY (V.0.) There's a town in Germany called Leverkusen that had a bear hunter named Hans Koblenz. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - LATER \nSloan, the Butcher and the Pharmacist walk across the parking lot toward the door of the smoking Bar-b-que joint. \n", "test3_id": 35}

WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY \n.Wesley Gibson, the guy from the opening scene, fast asleep in his little cubicle. Some drool falls off his lip and 'erks h' awake. Just then, the shot FREEZE-FRAMES, and we see IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE SHOT, his fat boss JANICE caught in mid- stride coming toward him, looking like she's ready to bring the wrath of God. \nWESLEY (V.O.) My name is Wesley Gibson. If you look at the corner of my desk, you'll see the billing reports I was supposed to hand in to Janice an hour ago. The BILLING ORT is highlighted on the screen for just a moment. .then the movie RESUMES normal speed and Janice reaches Wesley's cube in no time... \nBOSS JANICE Oh my fucking god I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your fucking desk. Holy shit on an altar, it isl A couple of the other OFFICE WORKERS look up at the fireworks and smile... like they're actually enjoying Janice's histrionics. \nBOSS JANICE (CONT'D) why don't you just take a dump in your hands, fork it over to me and say, \"this is the best effort I'm gonna give to you, Janice. This is the best you're ever gonna get out of me.\" Hell, Rochelle on her bbirthdav is doing a better a job than your lazy ass and she's already left for the day. Je-sus CHRIST! Wesley looks like he'd rather be anywhere else. \nWESLEY I meant to... \nBOSS JANICE (imitating him) I meant to... I meant to... Well I meant to be a size four but meaning to doesn't pick no cotton. \nShe snatches up the report off his desk. \nBOSS JANICE (CONT'D) Tell you what. I'll just input the four- ones myself. \n(ANNOUNCES) Look everyone, I'm gonna do Wesley's four- ones for him! I don't have enough to do with my own damn job so I'll do Wesley's too! Wesley grabs the report back. \nWESLEY I'll do it. \nBOSS JANICE Minimum for the maximum. That's all you ever do. The minimum you can do to suck the maximum from this company. \nWESLEY I said I'll get it done. I'm sorry. \nBOSS JANICE No, you're worthless. I'm the one who's sorry I hired you. She storms away, fuming. Wesley looks over and sees some of the other workers still staring at him, amused. He sits back down to the semi-privacy of his little cubicle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MEETING ROOM - DAY \nA CONSULTANT in a suit is droning on and on in front of a nifty power-point presentation. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Wesley, bored to tears, sitting at a long table with Janice and other corporate minions. The CAMERA FINDS Wesley's note-pad where it looks like he's taking notes on the presentation. Instead, covering every inch of the page, is the phrase \"life sucks then you die.\" \nWESLEY (V.O.) My job title is Account Manager. I used to be called an Account Service Representative, but a consultant told us we needed to \"manage\" our clients and not \" service- them. Onemore \"life sucks then you die.\" \nWESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D) I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GIRLFRIEND'S APARTMENT - DAY \n", "test1_true": "WESLEY (V.0.)

MEETING ROOM - DAY \nWesley is still sitting there with his note pad, while the consultant continues to rattle on and on about God knows what. Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley can spot his company.'s hot intern, NICOLE, talking on the phone. He zeroes in on her, until... Wesley suddenly looks around the room and everyone ijL_ staring at him. \nWESLEY \n(HESITANTLY) Yes. Uh... Well the 602 deals with applications sent by prospective clients and the 603 is when the client is... Everyone is still just staring... \nWESLEY (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Jesus... uh... what was the question? \nCONSULTANT I asked you about the effects of net investment income with regards to underwriting cycles. \nWESLEY Well, that's the thing.- \nCONSULTANT What's the thing? \nWESLEY (trying to redeem himself) Cycles. Hard market, industry-wide cycles differ from our firm's cycles so I think it's amistake to apply... \nJANICE Good God a'mighty. \nCONSULTANT Son... everyone knows that net investment income is inversely related to both premium and loss reserves, making firm cycles inherently dependent on industry cycles! Everyone snickers. \nCONSULTANT (CONT'D) In fact, to prove my point, I'd like you to spend some time this afternoon adding up the yearly differential responses. \nJANICE Get it to me by five. \nWESLEY Sure. Wesley jots down on his pad: \"ACTION ITEMS,\" and underneath it: \"Differential responses... then you die.\" He underlines it three times. \nINT. BREAK ROOM - DAY \nWesley sits at a small round table by himself, eating a ham and cheese on white. \nA group of. other WORKERS sit at a table nearby, gossiping and guffawing about whatever shit they have to discuss. \nWESLEY (V.O.) There are people, everyday you meet them, who you wish could see you in a different setting, a different place... Just then, Nicole, the pretty intern, approaches and starts fishing through the refrigerator. \nWESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D) .instead of where you are, what you've become. Wesley sits upright, glad now that no one is sitting at his table. Nicole turns and smiles at Wesley, starts to head his way, when... \nLOUDMOUTH AT OTHER TABLE Nicole! Get your ass over here and.tell us what the hell is going on with you and Whitcock the big cock! He pulls a chair over from next to Wesley to make room for her at his table. Wesley just takes another bite of his sandwich. \nINT. WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY \nWesley is staring, at his monitor... \nWESLEY (V.0.) And you wish to god your eyeballs weren't being sucked out of their sockets by monitor fatigue. That you didn't spend five years in college to do goddamn differential responses. see that he is actually i>laying solitaire on the computer. He keeps checking over his shoulder for Janice, but she is talking on the phone in her office with the door shut. He looks up and watches the computer clock turn from 4:59 to 5:00. He saves his solitaire game and then turns off the computer, snatches up his jacket, waits for Janice to turn her back to him as she is engrossed in her call, and then sneaks away. \nINT.

Wesley uncovers the first body... it's a. black male. \nFOX (CONT'D) Nahh, let the brother rest. Find us some white meat. And nothing too fat. Wesley covers the black male and moves over to a second body. He unveils it to reveal... what looks like a dead suburban housewife. \nFOX (CONT'D) Perfect. Load up soccer mom. \nINT. TARGET ROOM - NIGHT \nFox and Sloan stand next to a paper target -- the kind of thing you see in a police target range. It shows the outline of a head and torso with concentric rings for where you're supposed to aim. The Gunsmith hoists the corpse of the dead soccer mom on to a hook that hangs ten feet in front of the paper target. Sloan flips a switch and a motor takes the mom and target to the end of the range. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Wesley is with them standing in one of those firearm booths at the opposite end of the range. \nSLOAN Selecting your weapon and then disposing of it is the most pivotal aspect of every assassination. An array of firearms are on a shelf next to Wesley. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Pick one. Wesley eyes all the weaponry. Finally, he settles on a short-barreled black handgun. Sloan takes it from him and inspects it. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Excellent. This is an Imanishi 18. It holds seventeen bullets in the clip and one in the chamber. It's made of a composite material unrecognizable by metal detectors. \n(MORE) \nSLOAN (CONT'D) And the Imanishi's bullets have microchips that communicate with similar ones in the gun. \nWESLEY Computer chips? \nSLOAN \n(NODS) Sometimes the closest distance between two points is not a straight line. What if soccer mom here is between you and your target? \nWESLEY I suppose you're going to tell me to shoot her first. \nSLOAN How'd you do in Physics class? \nWESLEY Mostly B's. Fox cocks her head at Wesley, knows he's lying. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Okay, I got a D. \nSLOAN Why? \nWESLEY I couldn't remember all the rules -- \nSLOAN That's it. Rules. What if I told you there weren't any? He nods at Wesley, like he's on to something. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) People live by the rules set before them. We take them on faith that they are right. But how many times in your life have you thought you had a better way, against-the rules that was simply laughed at. \nWESLEY Every day. \nSLOAN Because you use your brain differently than other people. All Fraternity members do. \nWESLEY I don't get it. \nSLOAN Humans use neurons to think. But most people can only handle a small percentage of those neurons firing at once without suffering a seizure or an aneurism. Not us. And not you. We have the ability to think differently than other people. \nWESLEY So we set our own rules. \n", "test2_true": "SLOAN (CONT'D Try it. Wesley aims the pistol at the target in front of him. He \nFIRES... ..and the bullet plugs soccer mom in the shoulder. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Have you ever shot a gun before? \nWESLEY Just the flies. \nSLOAN So you have no pre-conceived habits we need to break. Shoot the target. Don't hit mom. \nWESLEY You mean curve the bullet? How? \nSLOAN This isn't about \"how.\" It's about \"what.\" If you'd never been told a bullet flies straight and I handed you this and said hit that target... what would you do? Allow your instincts to guide you. Just like the flies. \n(MORE) \nSLOAN (CONT'D) The technology is only here to assist your natural instinct. Wesley lifts the gun, his mind racing... \nSLOAN (CONT'D) It's not 'will' that makes the physical react how we wish, it's 'control.' You are in control... \nBAM BAM BAM! The bullets blast out of the gun, like they are on a track set up by Wesley's brain. He flicks his wrists and... .they arc qUickly, Just missing the body i e th2 center of the target! Sloan smiles. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Rules are made to be broken, Wesley. No one was better at that than your father. He had a pair of pearl-handled revolvers with which he could conduct a symphony. L i Wesley nods proudly, and squeezes off some more shots, all chasing through the same hole in the target. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. WESLEY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCathy jumps up from the couch when Wesley comes in. \nCATHY Oh my god, Wesley, where have you been? I've been so worried! But Wesley just pushes past her and starts to throw clothes out of drawers into a black duffel bag. \nCATHY (CONT'D) What're you doing? Are you leaving? You .owe rent! But Wesley just keeps packing. \nCATHY (CONT'D) You can't leave! This is bullshit, Wesley. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. \nWesley just zips up his bag and turns back toward the door... .where Egx is now standing, wearing outf' that would make the devil blush. \nCATHY (CONT'D) Who the fuck are you? But Fox doesn't even acknowledge her presence, and just watches Wesley do his business. Wesley walks out the door and Fox follows. Cathy chases them out on to the landing... \nCATHY (CONT'D) You're nothing, Wesley! And you will always be nothing! You think you're gonna be happy.with that skank... Uh-oh... Fox stops and turns around -- fisting her pistols. She unloads... BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! The CAMERA SWINGS OVER TO CATHY, who is about to pies herself, standing in the door frame, with bullet holes placed expertly around her head. Wesley and Fox keep moving, down the steps. Barry is coming up the steps, but he takes one look at them, does a U-turn and hurries out of their path. \nINT. FOX'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nWesley tosses his bag into the corner of this immaculately furnished penthouse apartment, overlooking the skyline. \nFOX You can take the couch until we find you someplace better. \nWESLEY Okay. She moves toward a separate bedroom. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) Fox? She stops. \n", "test2_id": 34, "test3_input": "The color red appears sporadically throughout the entire model city: on the sides of buildings, on mailboxes, on some of the manhole covers. \nWESLEY What's with the red ones?

STREET - DAY \n.the s city street, now full-sized, buzzing with activity, pedestrians hurrying to work, cars and taxis and trucks whizzing through the street. Sloan and Wesley walk down the sidewalk, passing streetlight after streetlight until they reach one in particular. \nSLOAN The Fraternity's grasp reaches every facet of the world's major cities, including their construction. Look at this streetlight. Wesley peers at it... there is a plaque affixed to the pole... the standard thing you find on these things... \"Municipal C. W. 63070.\" But then there is something different on this one... a tiny symbol on the bottom of the plaque... the Cerberus instead of the seal of the cit Sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside, revealing a hollow space behind it. He reaches his hand inside and pulls out a small handgun... flips out the clip expertly, then racks the weapon. Wesley can't believe it. \nWESLEY You have stashes... \nSLOAN .everywhere. \nWESLEY Jesus. \nJust then, two POLICE OFFICERS walk by, eye.the gun Sloan has pulled out. \nPOLICE OFFICER Sir... Sloan flashes his tattoo at them. \nSLOAN Keep moving, fellas. They nod and do just that. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) They let us do our jobs, we let them live. THE CAMERA PUSHES IN on Wesley's face as he realizes the full scope of this organization and we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSERIES OF SHOTS: GUN RANGE. Wesley firing his Imanishi 18 on the shooting range, steering the bullets wherever he wants them to go. \nWESLEY Closer. Impressed, the Gunsmith moves the corpse closer to the target, making the angle all that much tougher. Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol starts FIRING next to him. He looks over... Sloan is standing nr= &o him, firing at the target. Every shot bends around the body and hits right in the forehead of the target. Wesley smiles, impressed. LIBRARY. Wesley thumbs through an old Fraternity book, which has detailed sketches of an assassination in 17th century Paris. MEAT LOCKER. Wesley working out on a heavy bag, honing his punches, the Chef holding the bag for him, muscles rippling. MAP ROOM. Wesley walks by himself amongst the miniature city, trying to memorize where the red marks are. \nINTERROGATION ROOM. Wesley sitting here,. being grilled by Sloan, as he tries to-tell the undetectable lie. \nSLOAN Our job isn't just about how fast or true you shoot, Wesley. Physical agility will always lose to mental agility. It's warfare of the mind. FO 'S APART. Wesley looking at Fox through the bedroom door. SLAUGHTERHOUSE. Wesley working with the Butcher on the art of knife play. MAP ROOM. The Gardener and Fox show Wesley the rooftop of a certain building on the model city, one corner of the roof painted red. ROOFTOP. Fox and the Gardener now with Wesley on that actual rooftop, pointing out firing angles, modes. of ascension, and escape routes. The Gardener moves over to a cornerstone in the roof of the building and then easily lifts it off, revealing a stash of assault rifles. k SHOOTING G . Wesley looking at some ammunition while the Gunsmith talks and demonstrates. He fires at one of the targets, which EXPLODES in a splattered mess and we cut to... \nINT. FOX'S PENTHOUSE - MORNING \nFox making coffee as Wesley sits, studying the binder, his mind racing. \nWESLEY Cross and my father were tight. But Cross thought he should be one of the heads of the Fraternity so he left and vowed to kill the three heads. Which means my father is dead because of petty jealousy. \nFOX More reason for Cross to die. Wesley flips to the picture of cross. \nWESLEY But I don't see jealousy in those eyes, do you? Fox walks over and slams the binder shut. \nFOX Listen .to me, Wesley. In two weeks, we have to kill Henry Helms. Do-you know who that is? \nWESLEY The journalist who's got a price-tag on his head. \nFOX A price-tag that we're going to collect. Your father was meeting with a fence about the job when Cross took him down. So we can only assume Cross knows about the target too. We... you... have to take Cross out before we prosecute this mission. We can't have him out there as a wildcard, wreaking havoc, do you understand? \n", "test3_true": "FOX We've never defaulted on a job and this 1k one won't be the first. \nINT. TARGET ROOM - DAY \nSloan fires at the target, the bullets following his every command. Wesley does the same, equally skilled. Fox sits, watching the two of them. Is it becoming competitive? One shoots and then the other follows, neither one ever missing. Finally, Gunsmith runs the target back in to change out the body. Fox leans back, impressed. \nFOX May have found your match, Sloan. Sloan smirks and turns to instruct Wesley. \nSLOAN Pick the weapon, make the kill, destroy the weapon. No other rules. Wesley nods as Gunsmith returns. \nWESLEY (to the Gunsmith) Close the gap. Push the body closer to the target.. \nTHE GUNSMITH It's already at four feet. \nWESLEY Closer. \nTHE GUNSMITH Here's two. Your father couldn't even do that. \nWESLEY Closer. \nTHE GUNSMITH Wesley, at some point -- \nWESLEY Closer. I'll say when. \nWN Gunsmith starts sliding the target closer to the body, until it's actually touching the back of the dead business man! \nTHE GUNSMITH How you gonna -- ? \nFOX Just run it out there. Let the kid work. The Gunsmith shrugs and runs the target down the range. Wesley looks at Sloan. \nWESLEY You wanna go first? \nSLOAN There are limits to everything, Wesley. At some point the body becomes a shield. Wesley pulls his gun and lets loose five rounds, lightning fast. The Gunsmith brings the target back to them... ..a the business man is riddled with es. \nTHE GUNSMITH I guess not every rule can be broken. \nWESLEY Check the target. The Gunsmith does and we see that each of the five bullets has passed clean through the cadaver and found it's mark on the target. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) You'll find one entry below the shoulder, missing the major blood vessels there, exiting the back. Second shot went through the abdomen, clipped only the bowel and exited cleanly. Third hit the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, which is partially protected by the ribcage, and passed through the liver and probably part of the gallbladder. Upper left abdomen is a good place, where number four ruptured the spleen before continuing down main street. And finally, what I like to call \"the ,7FK.\" Number five entered the mouth, was redirected downward by the upper jawbone ON, and exited the back of the neck. That's the shot you'll find in the middle of the target. Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target. \nWESLEY (CONT'D) (to Sloan) Fuck the rules. With that, he turns and walks away, a look on his face that is his fiercest, a far cry from the kid in the cubicle. That same expression is on his face as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.

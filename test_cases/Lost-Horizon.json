You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] \nDuring this George has been looking around - he rises. \nGEORGE \nAll right, all right. Calm yourself. I'll talk to Fenner. \nHe crosses to panel leading to cockpit, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. When he gets there he knocks on the window. \nGEORGE \nFenner! I - I say\u0097 \nGeorge knocks again. From the cockpit side - the small shade suddenly snaps up - and George finds himself staring into the face of the mysterious pilot. He takes an instinctive step backward. The pilot turns his head. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as George keeps backing up until he gets to Conway. George turns to Conway and shakes his shoulder. \nGEORGE \nBob! Bob! \nConway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens his eyes, yawns and stretches. Throughout it, George speaks. \nGEORGE \nWake up! Something's happened! It isn't Fenner in the cockpit! \nConway looks at him, glances off toward the others, and back at George. \nCONWAY \n(dismissing him with a gesture) \nOh, stop it! \nGEORGE \nThe bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something. \nBARNARD \nWe're nowhere near Shanghai. We're going in the opposite direction. \nThis interests Conway and he looks out of the window. \nCONWAY \nWe're over the desert. That's funny. \nThen rising, he crosses to cockpit. The others watch him expectantly. \n46. GROUP SHOT - AROUND COCKPIT \nConway pounds on the panel. The face of the pilot appears in sight. Conway tries to ask him something in Chinese. The pilot glares at them for a second, then a gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively they back away. \nCONWAY \nCharming chap. \nBARNARD \n(not being funny) \nNice puss to meet in a dark alley. \nThe ship lurches - and they are thrown off balance. The panel has been snapped shut. \nCONWAY \nWell, that's that, I guess. \nBARNARD \nWonder what's happened to Fenner. \nLOVETT \nYes. And who is he ? How'd he get there? \nBARNARD \nDo you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots? \nCONWAY \nNo. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened. \nLOVETT \nOf course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long. \nCONWAY \n(with finality) \nThat fellow got on at Baskul. \nLOVETT \nWhat's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know. \nGeorge, who has disappeared during the above, now returns, with a monkey wrench in his hand. Conway stops him. \nCONWAY \nGeorge, what are you going to do? \nGEORGE \nI'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is. \nLOVETT \nGood. \nCONWAY \nWhat if he refuses? \nLOVETT \nWe'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do. \nCONWAY \nBrilliant! \n(a sweeping gesture) \nCan anyone here fly a plane? \nThere is a general chorus of \"no\u0097not I,\" etc. \nCONWAY \n(takes wrench from George's hand) \nWell, George, that's no good. \nConway throws the monkey wrench into a corner. \nCONWAY \nI guess we're in for it. \nLOVETT \nIn for what? \nCONWAY \nI don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner. \n(starts for his seat) \nWhen he lands, we'll find out. \nLOVETT \nYou mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land? \nCONWAY \nWhat do you suggest? \n", "test1_true": "Why, you - you\u0097 Look here - he may dash us to pieces! \nCONWAY \nIt might afford you a great deal of relief. \n(sitting) \nNow gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep.

The others watch him for a second - and wander back to their seats. \n47. CLOSE SHOT - GLORIA AND BARNARD \nGloria is apparently indifferent to their predicament. As Barnard watches her, a little bitter smile plays around her mouth. \n48. CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE \nHe stares out of the window and is suddenly startled. \nEXT. SHOT OF PLANE \n49. LONG SHOT \nOf the plane with its nose turned downward in a sharp descent. \nINT. CABIN OF PLANE \n50. MEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge is on his feet. \nGEORGE \n(excited) \nWe're heading down! We're going to land! \nEveryone looks out. George rushes to Conway and nudges him. \nGEORGE \n(breathlessly) \nBob, we're landing! \n(pointing out) \nBob, we're coming to a village! \nConway sits up and looks out. \nEXT. SHOT OF PLANE \n51.

SHOT FROM AIRPLANE \n53. LONG SHOT \nFrom angle in cabin of plane. Through the window, directly below we see a large open space at the foot of the hills. The plane is headed for it. \n54. LONG SHOT \nWe see a swarm of strange-looking natives, scantily attired, but bearing bayonets, running toward the plane. \nINT. PLANE \n55. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nOf George and Conway, as the ship hits the ground, bouncing and swaying perilously. \nEXT. MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY \n56. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs the plane taxies across the uninhabited space. \nINTERIOR PLANE \n57. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR \nConway and George ready to get out. As Conway turns to open the door, he looks off and is startled by something he sees. George follows his gaze, and a bewildered expression comes into his eyes, too. \nEXTERIOR OF PLANE \n58. LONG SHOT \nShooting through door. The strange-looking natives have surrounded the plane and are closing in. \nINTERIOR PLANE \n59. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway and George both instinctively wheel around toward the opposite side. But from that direction too, a horde of natives dash toward them. Conway hesitates a second, and like a flash springs for the door. But he stops again, as he opens the door. \nEXTERIOR OF PLANE \n60. MEDIUM SHOT \nTo include door of plane. Conway finds himself staring into the threatening mouths of half a dozen rifles, and quickly shuts the door. \nGEORGE \nWhat are these people? \nCONWAY \nI don't know. I can't get the dialect. \nEXTERIOR OF PLANE \n61. MEDIUM SHOT THROUGH WINDOW \nWe see the pilot and several natives in single file as they come toward the plane, buckets in hand. In b.g., one of them lowers a bucket into a well in the ground. \nGEORGE \nLook - they're loading up with gasoline. \nEXTERIOR OF PLANE \n62. SEVERAL SHOTS \nThe gas is being loaded. Natives on horseback dash back and forth shouting and signalling. Camels can be glimpsed among the horses. There is tremendous disorder and commotion. \n63. LONG SHOT \nThe ship leaves the ground. The natives stand around, curiously watching. \nINTERIOR PLANE \n64. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway is pacing. The occupants sit by their open windows. \nCONWAY \nImagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us! \n(he sits down) \nGeorge, something tells me our journey is just beginning. \nLOVETT \nWhere are we going? Huh? \nBARNARD \n(pointing) \n", "test1_id": 1443, "test2_input": "We follow many. \nA look of surprise spreads over Conway's face. \nCHANG \n(thoughtfully) \nTo put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including\u0097 \n(he smiles) \n\u0097the excess of virtue itself. \n165. CLOSER SHOT - THE TWO \nCONWAY \nThat's intelligent. \nCHANG \nWe find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy. \nCONWAY \nHow about law and order? You have no soldiers or police? \nCHANG \nOh, good heavens, no! \nCONWAY \nHow do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals? \nCHANG \nWhy, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything. \nCONWAY \nYou have no disputes over women? \nCHANG \nOnly very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted. \nCONWAY \nSuppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not? \nCHANG \n(smiling) \nWell, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her. \n166. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO - FAVORING CONWAY \nCONWAY \nThat's very convenient. I think I'd like that. \nCHANG \nYou'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems. \n167. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO \nChang smiles. Conway scarcely hears the last speech, for his attention has been caught by the playing of a piano. He stops to listen. Chang has walked out of scene. \n168. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway locates the direction whence the music comes, goes to a doorway where he stops. \n169. CLOSE SHOT - CHANG \nHe realizes Conway did not follow him and turns. When he sees Conway, his face clouds - and he starts toward him. \n170. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR \nConway watches someone through door with grave interest. Chang enters scene and follows his gaze. \nINT. MUSIC ROOM \n171. FULL SHOT \nFrom doorway. It is a spacious, high-ceilinged room, oddly shaped, and except for a piano, a harp and several chairs, is otherwise sparsely furnished. At the extreme end, the room is set off by an alcove of stained glass extending from the ceiling to the floor, where it finishes with a deep window seat. At the piano we see an old man - and by his side is the girl Conway saw last night. They finish playing and both laugh heartily. \n172. CLOSE SHOT AT DOORWAY \nConway finds her laughter infectious - and smiles. \n173. CLOSE SHOT - GIRL AND MAN AT PIANO \nIn the midst of her laughter, the girl sees Conway, off scene, and her face sobers - self-consciously. \n174. CLOSE SHOT AT DOORWAY \nChang quickly takes Conway by the arm. \nCHANG \nAt some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her. \nConway turns for one last glimpse of the girl, and then turns to Chang, looking up at his face, puzzled and amused. \nCONWAY \nSome man had better get ready to be very courteous to me. \n175. CLOSEUP - THE GIRL \nShe continues to stare off toward the door, her eyes alight with a keen interest. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR \n176. FOLLOW SHOT WITH CONWAY AND CHANG \nCONWAY \nBut Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters? \nCHANG \nThey were. \nCONWAY \nWell, it must have taken\u0096 \nCHANG \nCenturies. \nCONWAY \nCenturies! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures? \nCHANG \nOf course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it. \nINT. A ROOM \n177. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO \nThey have arrived in a small room, where they pause. Chang reaches into a bowl of large nuts, cracks one, and hands the nut to Conway. Then he does the same for himself. During the following scene, both are eating nuts from the bowl. \nCONWAY \nThat would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them? \nCHANG \nOur Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . . \nCONWAY \n\u0097buy and sell? \nCHANG \n", "test2_true": "CONWAY \n(chuckling) \nI see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start? \nCHANG \nThat, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man. \nCONWAY \nWho? \nCHANG \nA Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault. \nCONWAY \nWhen was all this? \nCHANG \nOh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself. \nCONWAY \n(shocked) \nHe amputated his own leg? \nCHANG \nYes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation. \nCONWAY \nWell, they didn't actually mean that. \nCHANG \nYes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here. \nCONWAY \nWell, is it? \nCHANG \nRather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg? \nCONWAY \n108 and still active? \nCHANG \nYou're startled? \nCONWAY \nOh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all. \nCHANG \nForgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, \"He worried himself to death?\" or, \"This thing or that killed him?\" \nCONWAY \nVery often. \nCHANG \nAnd very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide. \nCONWAY \n(after a pause) \nThat's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course. \nCHANG \nWhy, Mr. Conway, you surprise me! \nCONWAY \nI surprise you? Now that's news. \nCHANG \nI mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it? \nCONWAY \nMr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course. \nCHANG \n(chuckles) \nThen everything is quite all right, isn't it? \nThey exit scene together. \nEXT. GARDEN[10] \n178. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nOn a garden bench Gloria slumps languidly. Suddenly we hear Barnard's voice, yelling. Gloria quickly turns her back. Barnard runs into scene. \nBARNARD \nHoney, it's terrific! Terrific! I just saw something that will make your hair stand on end. You see those hills over there? Gold! Gold! Popping right out of them! Tons of it! \n(conspiratorially) \nNow look, you keep this under your hat, because if those other monkeys hear about it, they'll declare themselves in. But if I can mine that stuff, I'll throw a bombshell into Wall Street. Now look, I've got a plan - and if I\u0097 \nGloria begins coughing heavily. Barnard notices how pale and haggard she looks. \nBARNARD \nAw say, honey, you aren't feeling well, are you? Look, don't pay too much attention to what those doctors tell you. I've seen an awful lot of people fool them, and I've got a hunch that this place is going to be good for you. Honest, I have. \n(waits for her reaction - receives none) \nCome on now. Come on. You be a good kid, and snap out of it, and I'll cut you in on the gold deal. Look, I'm going up and make a deal with Chang - right now. \nHe enthusiastically exits scene. \nINT. LOVETT'S ROOM \n179. CLOSE SHOT \nLovett enters warily, sits down at his desk and begins to write in his journal. \nINSERT OF WHAT HE WRITES: \nTHE DIARY OF ALEXANDER P. LOVETT \n2nd Day at Shangri-La \n\"This place is too mysterious!\" \nHe looks up, sees himself in a mirror and gives a start. Then, chuckling to himself reassuringly, he looks around warily and continues to write. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN SHANGRI-LA \n180. FULL SHOT \nIt is a bright, cheery morning. Conway is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings. He comes into the area where the horses are stabled. Two men are busily grooming the horses. \nCONWAY \n(cheerily) \nGood morning! \nMEN \nGood morning, Mr. Conway! \n", "test2_id": 1444, "test3_input": "(pause) \nFor I am going to die. \nThere is a pause during which Conway cannot conceal his amazement at this simple statement. \nLAMA \nI knew my work was done when I first set eyes upon you. \n275. CLOSEUP - CONWAY AND LAMA \nConway is too awed and impressed to utter a sound. The High Lama finally resumes. \nLAMA \nI have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without. \nCONWAY \nDo you think this will come in my time? \n276. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO \nHIGH LAMA \nYou, my son, will live through the storm. You will preserve the fragrance of our history, and add to it a touch of your own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens. \n(pause - magisterially) \nBut I see in the great distance a new world starting in the ruins - stirring clumsily - but in hopefulness, seeking its vast and legendary treasures. And they will all be here, my son, hidden behind the mountains in the Valley of the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a miracle. \nThe voice of the Lama, toward the last, seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly engrossed, half-consciously waits for it to continue. Following a protracted silence, he slowly turns toward the Lama. A breeze blows through the room, ruffling curtains on the window. \n277. CLOSE SHOT - THE HIGH LAMA \nFrom whose face the glow has faded. There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed mask. \n278. CLOSEUP - CONWAY \nHe stares, uncertainly, for a long while, with a slow realization that the High Lama is dead. Quite unaware that he is being moved emotionally, tears well up in his eyes. While still sitting this way, unable to stir, he becomes conscious of activity around him. \n279. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs two servants, unbeckoned, arrive - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the Lama. Then, in intervals of seconds, groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter softly and silently, and gather around the High Lama. We hear indistinguishable murmurs that might or might not be prayers. Conway is only vaguely aware of their presence - and after a few moments, scarcely conscious of what is actuating his movements, he drifts away from the murmuring Lamas, and walks in the direction of the door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BARNARD'S ROOM \n280. MEDIUM SHOT \nBarnard and Gloria are on their knees on the floor. Before them they have spread a large map or chart. Barnard is enthusiastically out - lining his plans. \nBARNARD \nLook, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here. \nGLORIA \nPipes? Where are you going to get pipes? \nBARNARD \nOh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay. \nThis is as far as they get for George at this moment barges in. \nGEORGE \nThere you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving. \nBARNARD \nLeaving? \nGEORGE \nYes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on! \nBARNARD \nWhen are you going to start? \nGEORGE \nRight this very minute! The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along. \nBARNARD \nI think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip. \nGEORGE \nYou mean you don't want to go? \nBARNARD \nWell - I'm\u0097 \nGEORGE \nI see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh? \nBARNARD \nWell, no. You see, I got this plumbing business\u0097 \nGEORGE \nAll right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you. \n(to Gloria) \nHow about you? \nBARNARD \nOh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey. \n(before she can answer) \nShe'll stick around too. \n(to Gloria) \nIs that right? \nGLORIA \n(beaming) \nIf you want me to! \nBARNARD \nSure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you. \nGEORGE \nAll right, suit yourself. But just remember you had your chance. \nAs he starts out, Lovett enters. \nGEORGE \nHow about you? Do you want to go? \nLOVETT \nGo? Where? \nGEORGE \nHome. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back. \n281. CLOSE TWO SHOT - GEORGE AND LOVETT \nLOVETT \nOh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started. \nGEORGE \n(irritably) \n", "test3_true": "LOVETT \nWell - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will.

MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Lovett joins the two on the floor. \nLOVETT \nHello, Gloria. \nGLORIA \nHello. \nLOVETT \nBarney, I've just finished translating one of the most interesting old tablets you can imagine. It told me all about the origin of the Masonic symbols and\u0097 \nBARNARD \nThat's swell, Lovey. I want to show you something. Look! \nHe proudly displays his map. \nLOVETT \nOh my, isn't that pretty! What is it? \nBARNARD \nPlumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village\u0097 \nAs all three heads go into a huddle. \nINT. CONWAY'S ROOM \n283. CLOSE SHOT \nConway stands in front of a window - his arms extended across - peering out moodily. He is watching a solemn and slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers - the funeral rites of the High Lama - accompanied by cermonial music and drum-beating. \n284. LONG SHOT \nShooting over his shoulder. \nGetting his view of the magisterial procession. \n285. CLOSE SHOT \nConway, as he thoughtfully surveys the surroundings of which he has just become master. \n286. CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR \nGeorge appears in the doorway. He looks around and espies Conway. For a moment he stands uncertainly, and finally enters. \nGEORGE \n(softly) \nBob\u0097 \n287. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Conway turns - and seeing him, evinces no emotion whatsoever. \nCONWAY \n(a murmur) \nHello, George. \nGeorge looks at him peculiarly. Conway's behavior is odd in view of their strained relationship. \nGEORGE \nWell, you can stop worrying about everything now, Bob. I've made arrangements to leave. If you'll let me close that window, I can talk to you. That noise is driving me crazy. \nHe closes the window. \nGEORGE \nI said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat? \n288. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO \nCONWAY \nYou can't leave, George. \nGEORGE \nWhy not? What's going to stop me? \nCONWAY \n(pleading) \nYou mustn't. You've got to stay here now. \nGEORGE \n(sharply) \nStay here?! \n(more softly) \nWhat's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here. \n(no response from Conway) \nI've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us? \nConway combats an impulse to tell him the whole story. \nCONWAY \n(impulsively) \nSomething grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either. \nGEORGE \nI don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it. \nCONWAY \nI will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful! \n(pause) \nWell, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . . \nWhile he is speaking, we slowly \nDISSOLVE TO: \n289.

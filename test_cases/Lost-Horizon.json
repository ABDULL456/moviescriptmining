{"train": "LOST HORIZON \nWritten by Robert previous hit Riskin \nbased on the novel by James Hilton \nFADE IN[1] \nOver the titles we see SUPERIMPOSED the snow-capped mountains leading to Shangri-La. \nCLOSE-UP of an impressive-looking book. The covers open and the pages turn. The first page reads: \nIn these days of wars and rumors of wars - haven't you ever dreamed of a place where there was peace and security, where living was not a struggle but a lasting delight? \nThe second page reads: \nOf course you have. So has every man since Time began. Always the same dream. Sometimes he calls it Utopia - sometimes the Fountain of Youth - sometimes merely \"that little chicken farm.\" \nThe third page reads: \nOne man had such a dream and saw it come true. He was Robert Conway - England's \"Man of the East\" - soldier, diplomat, public hero\u0097 \nThe fourth page reads: \nOur story starts in the war-torn Chinese city of Baskul, where Robert Conway has been sent to evacuate ninety white people before they are butchered in a local revolution. \nThe fifth and final page reads: \nBaskul - the night of March 10, 1935. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BASKUL FLYING FIELD - NIGHT \n1. LONG SHOT \nThe field is aflare with floodlights - on one side is an office building - on the other are hangars. The whole field is filled with Chinese refugees running around wildly. An Army transport is in front of the office building, motors going. \n2. REVERSE SHOT \nShowing in the distance, probably several miles away, the effect of a burning city, which is Baskul. Over the shot we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire. In the f.g., we see the silhouetted figures of Chinese running away from Baskul and toward the Camera, their personal packs on their backs. \n3. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nToward office building. Conway comes out of the building, followed by a small group of white people with frightened faces. They have to fight their way through a horde of milling Chinese. \n4. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Conway and group finally reach the plane where Conway forces the white people in. In this he is aided by his brother, George, a young and vigorous Englishman. The pilot sticks his head out of the cockpit. \nPILOT \nConway, we can't take more than seven! \nConway pulls a passenger out and gives the pilot a signal to start. \nCONWAY \n(to passenger) \nAll right. I'm sorry. There will be another plane in a minute. All right - go on. \n5. LONG SHOT \nMotors roar, and the plane starts to move, scattering those of the Chinese who were unfortunately too close to the ship. Conway and George rush back into the office building. \nINT. LARGE OFFICE ROOM \n6. FULL SHOT \nThere are about thirty white refugees, men, women and several children. They all lift their panicky faces to Conway and George as they enter. A barrage of questions are flung at them. \nAD-LIB \nAre there any more planes? Do you think the bandits will come here? Please take my wife next, Mr. Conway! \nCONWAY \nWait, wait! Everybody, wait! There are plenty of planes coming. Now everybody have patience. Everything will be all right. \nHe crosses to a back room. \nGEORGE \nYou have nothing to worry about. Leave everything to my brother. \nINT. RADIO ROOM \n7. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Conway enters to speak to operator. \nRADIO OPERATOR \nYes, sir - with seven passengers aboard. \nRADIO SPEAKER \nSeven passengers? Good. \nCONWAY \nGet me Shanghai. \nOPERATOR \nI'm talking to them now, sir. \nCONWAY \nHello? Hello? \nRADIO SPEAKER \nHello. Hello. \nCONWAY \n(into mike) \nConway speaking. Is Colonel Marsh there? \nCOLONEL'S VOICE \nRight here, Conway. Go ahead. \n8. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Conway continues into mike. \nCONWAY \nColonel, I need more planes. I've still about twenty people to get out. Where are those planes you promised us? \nCOLONEL'S VOICE \nWe sent everything we could find, Conway. \nCONWAY \nThey better get here soon or I can't be responsible\u0097 \n9. WIDER ANGLE \nAs George rushes in. \nGEORGE \nBob! I think I hear motors! \nCONWAY \n(listening - then into mike) \nColonel, wait a minute, they may be here now! \n(to George) \nSay George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here. \nGEORGE \nYes. \nHe starts for the door. \nCONWAY \nHello, Fenner. \nFENNER \n(broad grin) \nHello, Conway. Having a little trouble? \nCONWAY \nYou never mind me. Get this gadget off the ground. \nGeorge is pushing off Chinese. \nGEORGE \nBob, these are all that are left. \nCONWAY \n(to George) \nCome on! Quick! This way. \n22. MED. SHOT AT PLANE \nWhen Conway and others approach, George helps Gloria Stone up, while Conway faces the mob, punching at those who try to wedge their way forward. Finally one of them manages to get his foot on the step, and Conway pushes him violently. \n23. CLOSE SHOT - MAN \nWho staggers back and falls, sprawling. As he hits the ground, he yells: \nMAN \nYou can't leave me here, you blighter.[2] I'm a British subject! \nWe meet Alexander P. Lovett. \n24. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway looks his surprise and lifts him off the ground. \n25. CLOSE SHOT - A CHINAMAN \nGlaring off toward Conway, picks up a board and starts toward Conway. \n26. MED. CLOSE SHOT ENTRANCE TO SHIP \nGeorge emerges in time to see the Chinese lift the board and about to clout Conway on the head. George moves quickly, puts out his left hand, wards off the blow and with his right he punches the Chinese, who reels out of the scene. \nGEORGE \nLook out, Bob! \n27. MEDIUM SHOT \nA shadowy figure materializes in the cockpit, and clubs Fenner from behind. He shoves Fenner aside and takes his place. \n28. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway pushes George up and starts to mount himself. He looks off - and what he sees startles him. \nCONWAY \n(yells off) \nAll right, Fenner! Go ahead! \n29. LONG SHOT \nOf what Conway sees. Several trucks loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms - come tearing up the road - come to a stop. Some fire toward plane - others are setting up machine guns. Droves of refugees scramble to cover. \nINT. PLANE \n30. FULL SHOT \nAlready present are Barnard, an American; Gloria Stone, the prostitute; and Lovett, whom we saw dressed as a Chinese. Conway slams the door shut - looks off - then cries: \nCONWAY \nGet down on the floor, everybody. Go ahead, Fenner! \nThey all fall on their faces. \nGEORGE \nFenner, let's go! \n31. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nOf the new pilot setting the controls and lifting the plane into flight. \nEXT. FIELD \n32. LONG SHOT \nAs the plane swings around - taxies crazily - and leaves the ground, accompanied by gunfire of the bandits. \nINT. PLANE \n33. FULL SHOT \nThe occupants are still on the floor. Conway rises and glances out of a window, warily. \nCONWAY \n(mumbling) \nWell, I guess we're out of range. \n(to others) \nEverybody all right? \nThere are murmurs of \"Yes\" - \"I'm all right\" - as they raise themselves. \nGEORGE \nWhew! That was close. \n34. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway starts for the back seat and suddenly sees Lovett. \nCONWAY \nWhere did you come from? \nLOVETT \nI'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir. \nCONWAY \nWhy aren't you registered through our office? \nGEORGE \n(chiming in) \nIt would serve you right if you were left behind. \nLOVETT \n(high-pitched voice) \nHow could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head! \n(a grave injustice) \nRight over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape. \nCONWAY \nWhere were you hiding? \nLOVETT \nHiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly\u0097 \nCONWAY \nI know - and a war broke out right over your head. \nIf you ask me, we're heading straight for those mountains. \nEXTERIOR SHOT \n65. LONG SHOT \nWe see the plane against the sky. In the b.g., there is nothing but snow-covered mountains. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINSERT: A sign reading \"Shanghai Municipal Airport.\" \nINT. AIRPORT \n66. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nA Chinese officer is on the phone. \nCHINESE OFFICER \nA Douglas plane[6] from Baskul with Conway and four others aboard are missing. Unreported between here and Baskul. \nQUICK SHOTS of: \nA switchboard operator besieged by calls. \nA telegraph secretary furiously typing. \nNewspapers being run off a press. \nINT. FOREIGN OFFICE \n67. CLOSE SHOT \nOf a high official of the British Foreign Office. \nHIGH OFFICIAL \n(holding forth to his secretary) \nMake it very emphatic that His Majesty's Government will hold the Chinese government and all Chinese governors of Chinese provinces responsible for the complete safety of Robert Conway. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal other foreign department officials and functionaries arriving in the midst of his speech. \nHIGH OFFICIAL \nGood morning, gentlemen. \nFUNCTIONARIES \n(ad-libbing) \nGood morning, etc. \nOFFICIAL \nNo news yet, sir? \nHIGH OFFICIAL \nIt's fantastic. The plane couldn't disappear into thin air. \n(turning to secretary of the group) \nAnd cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai. Leave no stone unturned to find Conway. \n(turning back to foreign officials) \nAnd Robertson? \nROBERTSON \nYes, sir? \nHIGH OFFICIAL \nBetter get a postponement of the Far East conference. We can't afford to meet those nations without Conway. \nINT. PLANE \n68. MED. SHOT \nThe occupants are hunched up in the corner of their seats. What little clothes they have, and what few blankets, are bundled around them. All the windows are shut. \nINSERT: ALTOMETER \nRegistering a height of 10,000 feet. \n69. FULL SHOT \nThere is silence for a moment before Barnard speaks. \nBARNARD \nIt can't be kidnapping. They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it. \nNo one responds to his speculation and he lapses into silence. \n70. MED. SHOT \nTo include George, Conway and Lovett. \nGEORGE \nWhat do you make of it, Bob? You must have some idea? \nConway shrugs. \nCONWAY \nHuh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway. \nLOVETT \nWell, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do-nothing attitude is very disappointing. \nGEORGE \nWhat do you want him to do? \nLOVETT \nI don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary. \nLovett slips back into his corner and pulls his coat over his face. \nINSERT: OF ALTOMETER \nRegistering above 10,000 feet. We STAY on it as it climbs and climbs to 15,000 feet. \nEXT. MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY \n71. Showing the plane high over mountain peaks. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SHOT OF PLANE - NIGHT \n72. LONG SHOT \nAgainst a moonlit sky, we see a lone speck - the plane as it flies high above the mountains. It appears to be traveling through endless space. \nINT. PLANE \n73. MED. SHOT \nThe atmosphere is pervaded with a feeling of utter futility. The occupants are still slumped in the corners of their seats. \n74. CLOSE SHOT - GLORIA AND BARNARD \nGloria has a fit of coughing. She grabs her throat - as she gasps for breath. Barnard, himself feeble and exhausted, glances over at her sympathetically. \n75. WIDER SHOT \nIncluding Lovett, George, and Conway. Lovett sits with his chin helplessly on his chest, his mouth ludicrously open, his eyes popping. George, his teeth clenched, struggles against a desire to sob. Conway looks at him feelingly. \n76. CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE AND CONWAY \nConway's eyes never leave George, who finally unable to control himself, emits a sob - and rather ashamed, slaps his hand over his mouth and turns away. \nCONWAY \nOh George, come on. \nGEORGE \nGeorge pops into view on the opposite side, just as Conway has found the pilot's gun beside him on the seat. \nGEORGE \nWhat is it? Has he fainted? \nCONWAY \nIt looks like it. \n(sniffing) \nSmell those fumes? \nConway hops up beside the pilot. George follows suit. \nCONWAY \n(handing gun to George) \nHere George, take the gun. Hold the lights. I'm going to search him before he comes to. \n(while searching) \nWe might find something interesting. \n(finds something) \nHello - what's this? A map! \n(hands it to George) \nHe resumes his search enthusiastically. Suddenly he stops. The utter limpness of the pilot's body gives him pause. He lifts up his chin, stares into his face - pulls up his eyelid and then places a hand over his heart. He turns slowly toward George, who has been watching his brother intently. \nCONWAY \nHe's dead. \nGEORGE \nDead? \nGeorge stares unbelievingly. \nCONWAY \nIt must have happened the moment he hit the ground. \n(a pause) \nLet's take a look at this map. \nConway holds the map under the dashboard light. He studies it painstakingly, and his tense expression changes to one of deep concern. George's eyes are glued on him. \nGEORGE \nWhat is it? \nCONWAY \nSee that spot? \nGEORGE \nYes. \nCONWAY \nThat's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map. \nGEORGE \n(afraid to ask) \nWhat's it mean? \nCONWAY \nIt means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached. \nGeorge stares at him, wide-eyed, the gravity of their situation slowly penetrating his terrorized mind. Conway's thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the panel, and he looks up. \n92. MED. CLOSE SHOT THROUGH GLASS PANEL \nWe see the faces of Barnard and the others. We hear their voices inquiring - \"Hey, Conway, what's happening?\" - \"What's up?\" - \"Where are we?\" - \"What'd you find out?\" \n93. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY AND GEORGE \nConway turns to George. \nCONWAY \nGeorge, our chances of getting out of this are pretty slim. But it's up to us. \n(a nod toward cabin) \nWe can't have three hysterical people on our hands. \nHe enters the cabin through the cockpit. \nINT. CABIN OF PLANE \n94. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Conway enters, he is met by a volley of questions. \nAD-LIB \nWhat do you say? What'd you find out? \nCONWAY \n(interrupting - cheerily) \nEverything's all right. The pilot won't trouble us any more. He's - he's dead. \nThis is met by a series of exclamations. \nAD-LIB \nDead? How did it happen? \nCONWAY \nProbably a heart attack. \nBARNARD \nWhat are we going to do? \nCONWAY \nWell, there's nothing we can do until the morning. \n95. CLOSE SHOT \nTaking in George as he enters from cockpit. His terror-stricken eyes look dully before him. He stops in the doorway. \nCONWAY \nThe storm will probably die down by then. My suggestion is that we better all try and get a good night's rest. \n96. MEDIUM SHOT \nOver the shoulders of Gloria, Barnard and Lovett as they face Conway, who sits down. \nGEORGE \n(fiercely) \nWhy don't you tell them the truth? \n97. FULL SHOT \nThey all wheel around and face George. \nGEORGE \nWhy don't you tell them we're a million miles from civilization, without a chance of getting out of here alive? It's slow starvation - that's what it is. It's a slow, horrible death! \nWhen the significance of this outburst finally sinks into the chaotic minds of his listeners, they turn to Conway hopefully, certain he will refute it. But Conway looks beyond them at George. From his noncommittal silence, they realize that George's statement is the truth. They slip into their seats. The place is heavy with a fatalistic silence. George slowly crosses to his seat near Conway, avoiding his accusing eyes. Suddenly the air is rent with harsh, bitter laughter from Gloria. They all look up. \nGLORIA \nWell, that's perfect! Just perfect! What a kick I'm going to get out of this! \nThey all look up and glance out. \nEXTERIOR OF PLANE \n110. LONG SHOT THROUGH WINDOW \nFrom their angle. In the distance, just appearing over the top of a hill, we see a caravan of natives approaching. They are not close enough to distinguish who or what they are, but that they are human beings is apparent. \nINTERIOR PLANE \n111. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway takes in the unbelievable sight. We hear the exultant exclamations of the others. Barnard and Lovett start out of the plane. \nLOVETT \n(looking around) \nWhere are they? Do you see them? \nBARNARD \nYes! \nLOVETT \nDo you think they're cannibals? \nEXTERIOR OF PLANE \n112. MEDIUM SHOT \nWhere George, Lovett and Barnard wait, a trifle awe-stricken. Conway joins them. Gloria has stayed inside. \n113. MED. LONG SHOT \nThe approach of the caravan from the viewpoint of the group. It comprises some twenty Tibetans, attired in sheepskins, fur, hats and boots. Somewhere in the middle of the single file is Chang, an elderly Chinese. Chang steps forward as their leader. \n114. MED. SHOT (MOVING) \nAs Conway leaves his group and meets the oncoming party. He approaches Chang and bowing courteously, greets him in Chinese. Chang turns his head slowly and speaks in perfect Oxfordian English. \nCHANG \nI am from a nearby Lamasery. \n(holding out his hand) \nMy name is Chang. \n115. MEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge, Barnard and Lovett. \nGEORGE \nWhy, he's speaking English. \nLOVETT \nEnglish! \nCONWAY \n(shaking hands) \nAnd mine's Conway. \nCHANG \nHow do you do? \nCONWAY \nYou've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves travelling in the opposite direction\u0097 \nLOVETT \nAt the mercy of a mad pilot. \nCONWAY \nWe'd be eternally grateful if you\u0097 \nCHANG \n(interrupting) \nWhere is your mad pilot? \nCONWAY \nHe must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead. \nGEORGE \nWe were just going to bury him when you came along. \nCHANG \n(preoccupied) \nPardon me\u0097 \nChang turns to some of his men and issues an order in a foreign tongue, obviously instructions to take care of the pilot. \nCONWAY \n(when Chang is through) \nSo, if you will be good enough to direct us to your Lamasery\u0097 \n116. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP \nFavoring Chang. \nCHANG \nI shall consider it an honor to accompany you and your friends. \nHe issues a command to his men and turns to Conway. \nCHANG \nYou will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult. \nCONWAY \nThank you. \nSeveral men have hopped into the scene while he has been speaking. They come forward with boots - sheepskins - fur caps, etc. As they start to get into these new clothes: \nDISSOLVE TO: \n117. LONG SHOT \nAs the caravan starts its journey back up the hill. All five people are now attired in their newly acquired outfit. \n118. SERIES OF SHOTS \nShowing the party on various stages of what looks like a humanly impossible journey. We see them first climbing - then across long vastnesses of flat land. Each succeeding time we see them, their feet drag more wearily. Their breathing becomes more difficult. These pictures finally \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. NARROW TABLELAND \n119. MED. LONG SHOT \nHalfway up a mountainside. The procession is just starting around a hairpin curve. They are forced to travel on a narrow ledge overlooking a deep ravine. \n120. CLOSE SHOT - LOVETT, BARNARD AND GLORIA \nAs they cling against the rocky sides and glance apprehensively down into the abyss below. \n121. CLOSE SHOT - GLORIA \nClose by to Barnard. Gloria's face is wan and haggard. Every upward move seems to require a Herculean effort. She stops and has a fit of coughing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL \n122. LONG SHOT \nOf the snake-like moving party. They have reached quite a height although the peak of the mountain they are ascending towers high above them. The cutting wind moans treacherously as it caroms off the mountainside. A heavy mist envelops them. \nAll the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me. \nConway looks at him and smiles. \nBARNARD \nDon't mind Lovey. He's got the misery. \nLOVETT \nMr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious. \nCONWAY \nIt's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it? \nBARNARD \nI'll say. \nINT. GLORIA'S ROOM[ 9] \n140. FULL SHOT \nIt is in semi-darkness. The moon sends a stream of light through the windows. Outside we see the outline of towering mountains. Spread across the bed - her clothes unchanged - is the body of Gloria - her face sunk deep in the pillows. \n141. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nGloria emits wracking coughs. After a few moments - she sits up. Her cheeks are wet - her hair disheveled - her eyes bloodshot. We get an impression of someone who has suffered for hours. Finally, her coughing begins again - and unable to stand it, she rises and paces the floor - then she crosses to the window and looks down, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER - and into her eyes has come a grim, determined expression. \n142. LONG SHOT \nFrom Gloria's point of view. \nShe is staring at the chasm below her. \nCONTINUATION SCENE 141 \nGloria continues to peer below - and her coughing resumes. \nINT. CORRIDOR \n143. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Chang comes down the corridor - hears the coughing and stops. \nINT. GLORIA'S ROOM \n144. FULL SHOT \nChang enters and watches Gloria for a moment before speaking. \nCHANG \nIs there something I can do for you? \nGloria wheels around and glares at him. \nGLORIA \nWhat do you want? \nCHANG \nI've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps- \nGLORIA \nYou get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here- \nShe cannot finish as she is attacked by a fit of coughing. \nCHANG \nPlease calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do. \nGLORIA \n(through fits of coughing) \nI don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor! \nCHANG \nI'm sorry, but we have no doctors here. \nGLORIA \n(looks up quickly) \nNo doctors? \n(bitterly) \nThat's fine. That's just fine. \nCHANG \nPlease let me help you. \nGLORIA \nSure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump! \nCHANG \n(quietly) \nYou shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes? \nGLORIA \n(her voice cracking) \nDon't preach that cheap, second-hand stuff to me! \n(a sob escapes) \nGo on, beat it. Beat it! \nShe flings herself across the bed, coughing uncontrollably. Chang watches her sympathetically for a few seconds. \nCHANG \n(before turning away) \nPeace be with you, my child. \nINT. DINING ROOM \n145. FULL SHOT \nThey all look up as Chang enters. He is escorted to his place at the head of the table by two servants who stand on either side of his chair. \nCHANG \n(jovially) \nGood evening. Good evening, my friends. Oh no, no, no, please sit down. I hope you found everything satisfactory. \nBARNARD & CONWAY \nSwell. Excellent. \nCHANG \n(sees that no one has started) \nYou shouldn't have waited for me. \nBARNARD \nWhere's the girl? Miss Stone. \nCHANG \nShe's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well. \n(to others) \nNow please go on without me. I eat very little. \n146. MEDIUM SHOT \nShooting down the long table toward Chang. He sits up straight - studying them - as the others bend over their food. \nWe follow many. \nA look of surprise spreads over Conway's face. \nCHANG \n(thoughtfully) \nTo put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including\u0097 \n(he smiles) \n\u0097the excess of virtue itself. \n165. CLOSER SHOT - THE TWO \nCONWAY \nThat's intelligent. \nCHANG \nWe find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy. \nCONWAY \nHow about law and order? You have no soldiers or police? \nCHANG \nOh, good heavens, no! \nCONWAY \nHow do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals? \nCHANG \nWhy, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything. \nCONWAY \nYou have no disputes over women? \nCHANG \nOnly very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted. \nCONWAY \nSuppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not? \nCHANG \n(smiling) \nWell, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her. \n166. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO - FAVORING CONWAY \nCONWAY \nThat's very convenient. I think I'd like that. \nCHANG \nYou'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems. \n167. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO \nChang smiles. Conway scarcely hears the last speech, for his attention has been caught by the playing of a piano. He stops to listen. Chang has walked out of scene. \n168. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway locates the direction whence the music comes, goes to a doorway where he stops. \n169. CLOSE SHOT - CHANG \nHe realizes Conway did not follow him and turns. When he sees Conway, his face clouds - and he starts toward him. \n170. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR \nConway watches someone through door with grave interest. Chang enters scene and follows his gaze. \nINT. MUSIC ROOM \n171. FULL SHOT \nFrom doorway. It is a spacious, high-ceilinged room, oddly shaped, and except for a piano, a harp and several chairs, is otherwise sparsely furnished. At the extreme end, the room is set off by an alcove of stained glass extending from the ceiling to the floor, where it finishes with a deep window seat. At the piano we see an old man - and by his side is the girl Conway saw last night. They finish playing and both laugh heartily. \n172. CLOSE SHOT AT DOORWAY \nConway finds her laughter infectious - and smiles. \n173. CLOSE SHOT - GIRL AND MAN AT PIANO \nIn the midst of her laughter, the girl sees Conway, off scene, and her face sobers - self-consciously. \n174. CLOSE SHOT AT DOORWAY \nChang quickly takes Conway by the arm. \nCHANG \nAt some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her. \nConway turns for one last glimpse of the girl, and then turns to Chang, looking up at his face, puzzled and amused. \nCONWAY \nSome man had better get ready to be very courteous to me. \n175. CLOSEUP - THE GIRL \nShe continues to stare off toward the door, her eyes alight with a keen interest. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR \n176. FOLLOW SHOT WITH CONWAY AND CHANG \nCONWAY \nBut Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters? \nCHANG \nThey were. \nCONWAY \nWell, it must have taken\u0096 \nCHANG \nCenturies. \nCONWAY \nCenturies! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures? \nCHANG \nOf course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it. \nINT. A ROOM \n177. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO \nThey have arrived in a small room, where they pause. Chang reaches into a bowl of large nuts, cracks one, and hands the nut to Conway. Then he does the same for himself. During the following scene, both are eating nuts from the bowl. \nCONWAY \nThat would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them? \nCHANG \nOur Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . . \nCONWAY \n\u0097buy and sell? \nCHANG \nCONWAY \nOh, you speak English, do you? \nMEN \nYes, sir. \nONE OF THE MEN \nWould you like to take a ride, Mr. Conway? \nCONWAY \nNo, thanks. Not just now. \nSuddenly, Conway is startled by the sound of hoof-beats and, looking up, is in time to see 'the girl' of the previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him on a horse - screaming delightedly. As she passes him, she waves. \nCONWAY \n(instantly changing his mind) \nWell, I think I will take that ride! \n181. MED. SHOT - CONWAY \nAs he rides off in pursuit of her. \n182. SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE CHASE \nShowing Sondra successfully eluding him - as he closes in on her. \n183. MED. LONG SHOT - BOTTOM OF A HILL \nSondra whizzes by. As we stay on the shot - Conway rides through in exciting pursuit. \n184. ANOTHER ANGLE \nShowing Sondra disappearing behind a mountain waterfall. Conway dashes up, but she is lost from sight. He wheels around several times - and unable to find her, looks puzzled. Finally, giving up, he starts slowly back. After a few moments he is startled by her laughter, and glances around. \n185. LONG SHOT \nFrom his view - shooting upward. High up - near the summit of the hill - we see Sondra - waving and laughing. Then she swings her horse around and disappears. \n186. CLOSEUP - CONWAY \nAs he smiles - amused and interested. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n187. LONG SHOT - SONDRA \nAs she swims in a mountain stream, apparently in the buff. From a distance, we see her climb onto a rock to dry off. \n188. CLOSEUP - SONDRA \nAs she shakes her shimmering hair. \n189. MEDIUM SHOT - CONWAY \nHe has caught up to her tethered horse and is skulking around trying to find out where she is. \n190. CLOSE SHOT - A SQUIRREL \nA squirrel, near to Sondra, chatters excitedly. \n191. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA \nShe can apparently understand the squirrel's warning. She hurries to dive back into the water and swim to the other side. She comes up, spots Conway and watches him from hiding, behind some bushes. \n192. MEDIUM SHOT - CONWAY \nConway has discovered her clothing and is constructing a kind of scarecrow on a bush out of them. As a crowning touch, he adds a flower to the effigy, his eyes twinkling at his little joke. With one final glance over his shoulder, he turns to leave. \n193. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA \nShe stifles her laughter as he vanishes from view. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \n194. FULL SHOT \nLovett and Barnard are at the table waiting for the others. Several servants are in the b.g. George paces nervously in front of the door. \n195. MED. SHOT AT TABLE \nLovett and Barnard. Barnard nibbles at something. \nBARNARD \nBah! Fossils! Why? What for? Running around digging up a lot of old bones! You didn't dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance, did you? \nLovett is about to reply, when he realizes he is being made fun of, and gives a tentative chuckle. \nINT. CORRIDOR \n196. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway is coming down the corridor. George comes out of door to dining room and starts forward. Conway walks along in a cheerful mood, singing as he goes, a Cockney song. \nGEORGE \n(forces a smile) \nYou seem gay. Did you find out anything? \n197. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT WITH THEM \nAs they walk back toward dining room door. \nCONWAY \nWell - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners. \nGEORGE \nNothing about the porters yet? \nCONWAY \nPorters? \nGEORGE \nGood heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing. \nCONWAY \nWell, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we? \nGEORGE \nI'm afraid the porters are just a myth. \n(tensely) \nI guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners. \nCONWAY \nShhh! \nThey have reached the door and start into dining room. \nINT. DINING ROOM \n198. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Conway and George enter, Barnard calls to them: \nBARNARD \nHey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved! \nCONWAY \n(imitating Chang as he takes his chair) \nPlease! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little. \nBarnard laughs heartily. George, surily silent, enters and drops in his seat. At the same moment, Gloria comes into the room. \nGLORIA \n(whips out a revolver; grimly) \nI'll make that Chinese talk if it's the last thing I do! \nHe starts out. \n202. MEDIUM SHOT \nBefore anybody can realize what his intentions are, he has bolted out of the room. \nCONWAY \n(calling) \nGeorge! \nStarts after him. \nINT. CORRIDOR \n203. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs George strides determinedly out into the hall, yelling. \nGEORGE \nChang! Chang! \nSuddenly he sees a native servant and his eyes pop insanely. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he strides across to the servant and grabs him by the shirt-front. \nGEORGE \n(shaking servant violently) \nWhere is he? Where's Chang? Where is he? Where's Chang, or I'll blow your brains out! \nConway has caught up with him and wrestles him away from the servant, who stumbles off in fright. \nCONWAY \nGeorge, what do you think you're doing? \nGEORGE \nLet me go, Bob! \nGeorge pushes Conway away from him and starts down the corridor. \nCONWAY \nGeorge, come back! \nGEORGE \nChang! Chang! Chang! \nGeorge spies another servant. \nGEORGE \nCome here, you! Come here! \nThe servant, frightened by his voice, turns suddenly and starts running. George levels his revolver and sends a stream of bullets after the fleeing servant, who miraculously manages to skate around a corner, unharmed. Conway runs into scene, reaching George, and with a quick flip of his left hand he smacks him over his revolver arm - and with his right, he punches him flush on the jaw. \nCONWAY \nGeorge, you idiot! \nGeorge reels for a moment and slumps to the floor. \n204. CLOSE SHOT \nAs the others trail in. \nBARNARD \nHad to sock him, eh? \nConway pockets the gun and, bending over George, a pained expression on his face, starts to lift him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CONWAY'S ROOM \n205. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nConway brings George in, followed by the others. He drapes him across his bed. Conway stands by his side, looking down at him, deeply concerned. After a moment, Conway shakes him and George awakens with a start. \nGEORGE \nLet me up! Let me up! \nCONWAY \nAll right. Sorry, George. \nGeorge groans and turns away. \n206. MED. SHOT TOWARD DOOR \nOn Barnard, Lovett and Gloria. Barnard wanders over to Conway, who appears lost in thought. \nBARNARD \nSay Conway, is it true about us being kidnapped? \nConway shrugs. \nBARNARD \n(louder) \nI say, is it true about us being kidnapped? \nConway suddenly is aroused from his reverie by someone he sees off scene. He looks up alertly. \nCONWAY \nMr. Chang! \nChang enters scene, beaming charmingly. \nCONWAY \nDo you mind stepping in here for a moment? \n207. FULL SHOT \nAs Chang enters. He bows courteously to the others, who stand in front of George's bed. Conway shuts the door and turns the key. He crosses to a door leading to another room - and locks this one, also. Chang watches him curiously. The others, including George, who is now alert, are puzzled and somewhat impressed. Then Conway comes to Chang. \nCONWAY \nWon't you sit down? \nChang sits, his placidity unchanged. Conway pulls up a chair in front of him. \nCONWAY \n(very quietly) \nMr. Chang, you have been very kind to us - and we appreciate it. But for some reason we are being held prisoners here, and we want to know why. \n208. CLOSE SHOT - BARNARD, LOVETT AND GLORIA \nAs Conway's voice continues, talking to Chang: \nCONWAY \nPersonally, I don't mind at all. I'm enjoying every minute of it. \n(dead serious) \nBut my brother is not of the same opinion, nor are the others. \n(after a pause) \nIt's time we were told what it's all about. \n209. MED. SHOT - GROUP \nConway still continuing: \nCONWAY \nWe want to know why we were kidnapped, why we are being kept here, but most important of all - do we get the porters, and when? \nSit down, my son. \n(pause) \nYou may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years. \nConway evinces surprise. \nHIGH LAMA \nOh, not of Conway the empire-builder and public hero. I wanted to meet the Conway who in one of his books, said, \"There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal.\" \nThe quotation captures Conway's interest - and his eyes widen. \nHIGH LAMA \nThat Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here. \nCONWAY \nThat I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea? \nHIGH LAMA \nSondra Bizet. \nCONWAY \n(secretly pleased) \nOh, the girl at the piano? \nHIGH LAMA \nYes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all. \nCONWAY \nOf course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community? \nHIGH LAMA \nWe need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri-La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on. \nCONWAY \nBut to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on. \nHIGH LAMA \nWe have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing. \n(pause) \nLook at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful? What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books \nand their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind. \n(pause) \nWhen that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world. \n(pause) \nYes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth. \nA long silence ensues during which Conway, so engrossed is he in all he has just heard, scarcely notices the Lama, who has risen slowly and now stands before him. The Lama reaches down and gently touches him on the shoulder. \nCONWAY \n(scarcely audible) \nI understand you, Father. \nConway kisses the High Lama's hand. \nHIGH LAMA \nYou must come again, my son. Good night. \nConway slowly rises to his feet and turns to leave scene. \nINT. UPPER CHAMBER \n220. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR TO LAMA'S CHAMBERS \nConway comes through. He walks as if in a trance. CAMERA PULLS BACK as he continues on his way - bearing an expression of deep absorption. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LOWER CORRIDOR \n221. MED. SHOT \nAs Conway walks toward an open door at the end of corridor leading to the garden. Lovett emerges from one of the rooms and sees him. He beckons to those inside and almost immediately they come out and start toward Conway. \n222. MED. CLOSE SHOT NEAR GARDEN DOOR \nConway, just about to exit, when the others catch up to him. \nAD-LIB \nWe thought you were never coming back! \nWhat'd you find out? \nWhen do we leave? \nConway stares at them blankly. \nGEORGE \nWhat about the porters? \nCONWAY \n(vaguely) \nPorters? \nGEORGE \nDidn't you find out anything about the porters? \nCONWAY \nWhy - I'm sorry - but I\u0097 \nHe starts away from them, but they crowd around him. \nAD-LIB \nWhat were you doing all this time? \nYou've been gone for hours. \nGEORGE \nFor heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of\u0097 \nCONWAY \nGeorge. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight. \nHe leaves them. \nEXT. GARDEN - NIGHT \n223. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nShooting toward garden through open doorway. Conway walks away from the crowd in f.g., all staring at him, nonplussed. We see Conway walk through the garden in b.g. and disappear. \n224. CLOSEUP - GEORGE IN DOORWAY \nHe stares at his brother, off, fearfully. \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE VALLEY \n225. FULL SHOT \nOf a pleasant and peaceful place. Conway is walking along moodily, drinking in the pastoral beauty. \n226. MED. TRUCKING SHOT WITH CONWAY \nAs he walks along. He comes to a spot where a man and a woman are tilling the soil, and stops to watch them. The man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway also bows. The woman curtsies prettily and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in acknowledgement. \nThey exit scene. \nINT. PIGEON HOUSE \n246. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nOf a large coop where pigeons are bred and raised. The pigeons flutter around, landing on Sondra and Conway, as she shows him her collection with pride. She grabs one pigeon and ties one of the miniature flutes to its legs. \nSONDRA \nYou see, this is how we tie them on. And by varying the size of the flutes, I can get any notes I wish. The wind does the rest. Here's a little fellow who lost his! \nShe grabs another pigeon, ties a flute to its legs. \nCONWAY \n(wonderingly) \nWas this your idea? \nSONDRA \nYes. Hold this pigeon. \nCONWAY \nYou suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in? \nSONDRA \nThat was easy. I read your books. \nCONWAY \nOh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it? \nSONDRA \nI saw a man whose life was empty. \nCONWAY \nA man whose life was empty! \nSONDRA \nOh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it. \nConway scrutinizes her face intently. \nSONDRA \nAs a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark. \nCONWAY \nA little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty? \nSONDRA \n(after a pause) \nYes. \nCONWAY \n(good-naturedly) \nYou're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you? \nShe laughs merrily and shakes his hand. \nSONDRA \nI really only brought you here to show you my pigeons! \nCONWAY \nDon't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet! \nShe turns to leave, and he follows, exiting scene. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SOMEWHERE ON TOP OF A HILL \n247. MEDIUM TRUCKING SHOT \nSondra and Conway, walking. This spot is on top of a hill overlooking the splendor of the valley below. \n248. CLOSER TRUCKING SHOT \nThey walk along silently for a few seconds, while Conway studies her face speculatively. \nCONWAY \nThere are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin. \nSONDRA \nI'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here. \nCONWAY \nThank you. \nSONDRA \nWell, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself. \nCONWAY \nFather Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night. \nSONDRA \nYes, I know. \nCONWAY \nFather Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing. \nHe steals a sideways glance at her. She is greatly amused. \nSONDRA \n(satisfying his obvious curiosity) \nI'm thirty. \nCONWAY \nOh, you're going to make life very simple. \n249. MED. SHOT \nAs they arrive at a scenic overlook. It is getting toward dusk. \nCONWAY \n(wonderingly) \nIt's inconceivable. \nSONDRA \nWhat is? \nCONWAY \nAll of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely. \nSONDRA \nI'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange? \nCONWAY \nOn the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri-La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here. \nSONDRA \nI'm so glad. \nCONWAY \nLOVETT \n\u0097then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, \"Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed.\" And then the mama bear said, \"Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!\" And then the big papa bear, he roared, \"And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!\" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary! \nBARNARD \nI'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey! \nLOVETT \n(continuing) \nThey were in a quandary, and\u0097 \nBARNARD \nCome on, Lovey. \nLOVETT \nWhy? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter? Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I? \nBARNARD \nIn a quandary. \nThey all laugh. \nLOVETT \nI'm telling this story! I'm telling it. \n(continuing) \nYes, the poor little bears didn't know what to do, you see, because somebody had been sleeping in their bed. \nA CHILD IN THE AUDIENCE \nWho slept in their beds? \nNATIVE GIRL \n(the one who poured him a drink of wine\u0097 alluringly) \nWho was it, Lovey? \nLOVETT \n(smitten) \nOh, you call me Lovey, eh? \n(to Barnard) \nLook at those eyes? There's the devil in those eyes! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LOVETT'S BEDROOM \n255. CLOSE SHOT \nFollowing Lovett as he enters, unusually chipper, singing \"Here we go gathering nuts in May . . . \" He is in such a good mood that he improvises the lyrics, putting Shangri-La in with his la-la-las. After glancing out the window, Lovett sits down and pulls out his journal. He writes: \nINSERT: \nAPRIL 4TH \n24TH DAY AT SHANGRI-LA. FEEL SO GOOD I COULD SOW A WILD OAT\u0097 \nHe pauses, looks up, opens the compact box at his side and looks at himself confidently and admiringly in the mirror. Returning to his journal, he adds: \nINSERT: \n\u0097OR TWO. \nEXT. GARDEN - DAY \n256. MED. SHOT (MOVING) \nWith George as he disconsolately walks. He is startled by the sound of Maria's voice calling him. CAMERA PANS with him as he crosses to a sheltered spot where Maria sits on a garden bench. \nGEORGE \nHello, Maria. \nHe fumbles for a cigarette. \n257. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nMARIA \n(a little hurt) \nYou promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long. \nGEORGE \nI'm sorry. \n(chagrined to discover he has no cigarettes left) \nI haven't even got any cigarettes left! \nMARIA \nI'll make some for you! \n(pleading) \nYou will come today? \nGEORGE \n(after a pause) \nPerhaps. \nMARIA \n(tenderly) \nPlease say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you. \n(a whisper) \nPlease . . . \nGEORGE \nAll right, I'll be there. \nMARIA \n(happily) \nThank you. \nGEORGE \n(suddenly) \nYou'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you? You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us! \n258. CLOSEUP - MARIA \nFrom the moment he starts to speak, her face clouds. George's voice continues without interruption. \nGEORGE'S VOICE \nChang's been lying about those porters, hasn't he? \nShe runs off, frightened. \nINT. ELSEWHERE IN THE GARDEN \n259. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nFollowing Conway and Sondra as they stroll peacefully hand in hand amongst the sculpted shrubbery and rows of flowers. There is a sudden pealing of bells. The two of them look off and pause, their gaze momentarily captured by picturesque snowcapped peaks in the distance. \nCONWAY \n(moved) \nBeautiful! I'm waiting for the bump. \nOh, I'm so glad. \nLOVETT \nSimply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self-inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, \"Lovey\"\u0097 \n(catches himself - looks around) \nMr. Lovett! \"Mr. Lovett,\" I said, \"you are an ungrateful fool . . . \" \nCHANG \nWhy, no. \nLOVETT \n\"Ungrateful fool . . . !\" Those were my very words to myself last night. \"Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation.\" \nCHANG \nNow, what would you like to do? \nLOVETT \nWell, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology. \nCHANG \nSplendid! \nLOVETT \nIsn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one. \nCHANG \nI'm sure you were. When would you like to start? \nLOVETT \nOh, immediately. \nCHANG \n(offering his handshake) \nThen it's done. \nLOVETT \nOh, thank you. Thank you! \nCHANG \nThank you. \nEXTERIOR GARDEN \n263. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway sits on a bench - Barnard leans over him, showing him a map - a-twitter with an idea. \nBARNARD \nYou see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time. \n(aghast) \nDo you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water? \n264. CLOSER SHOT - THE TWO \nCONWAY \n(a twinkle in his eye) \nIt's unbelievable. \nBARNARD \nThink of it! In times like these. \nCONWAY \nSay, what about that gold deal? \nBARNARD \nHuh? \nCONWAY \nGold. You were going to\u0097 \nBARNARD \n(interrupting) \nOh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it. \n(full of business) \nSay, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang. \n(exiting) \nSo long. Don't you take any wooden nickels. \nCONWAY \nAll right. \nHe disappears. We hear him whistling, something joyous. Probably \"The Old Gray Mare Ain't What She Usta Be\"\u0097 \n265. CLOSEUP - CONWAY \nAs he watches Barnard go, pleased at the metamorphosis that's taking place in him. Suddenly he sees George and jumps up. \nCONWAY \nGeorge. \n266. MED. LONG SHOT \nFrom Conway's angle. George has just made his appearance. \nCONWAY \nGeorge! \nGeorge keeps on going and Conway runs toward him. \n267. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Conway catches up to George\u0097and takes him by the arm. \nCONWAY \n(sincerely) \nGeorge - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks. \nGEORGE \n(coldly) \nI don't see that there's anything to say. \nAnd releasing his arm, he leaves Conway abruptly. \n268. CLOSEUP - CONWAY \nAs a look of deep pain comes into his face. He stands for several seconds - looking helplessly - and despairingly in George's direction. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN \nINT. LIVING ROOM \n269. MEDIUM SHOT \nChang and Conway playing chess. Conway leans over the board, a faraway expression on his face. Chang leans over - moves a 'man' into position. \nCHANG \n(pause) \nFor I am going to die. \nThere is a pause during which Conway cannot conceal his amazement at this simple statement. \nLAMA \nI knew my work was done when I first set eyes upon you. \n275. CLOSEUP - CONWAY AND LAMA \nConway is too awed and impressed to utter a sound. The High Lama finally resumes. \nLAMA \nI have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without. \nCONWAY \nDo you think this will come in my time? \n276. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO \nHIGH LAMA \nYou, my son, will live through the storm. You will preserve the fragrance of our history, and add to it a touch of your own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens. \n(pause - magisterially) \nBut I see in the great distance a new world starting in the ruins - stirring clumsily - but in hopefulness, seeking its vast and legendary treasures. And they will all be here, my son, hidden behind the mountains in the Valley of the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a miracle. \nThe voice of the Lama, toward the last, seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly engrossed, half-consciously waits for it to continue. Following a protracted silence, he slowly turns toward the Lama. A breeze blows through the room, ruffling curtains on the window. \n277. CLOSE SHOT - THE HIGH LAMA \nFrom whose face the glow has faded. There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed mask. \n278. CLOSEUP - CONWAY \nHe stares, uncertainly, for a long while, with a slow realization that the High Lama is dead. Quite unaware that he is being moved emotionally, tears well up in his eyes. While still sitting this way, unable to stir, he becomes conscious of activity around him. \n279. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs two servants, unbeckoned, arrive - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the Lama. Then, in intervals of seconds, groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter softly and silently, and gather around the High Lama. We hear indistinguishable murmurs that might or might not be prayers. Conway is only vaguely aware of their presence - and after a few moments, scarcely conscious of what is actuating his movements, he drifts away from the murmuring Lamas, and walks in the direction of the door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BARNARD'S ROOM \n280. MEDIUM SHOT \nBarnard and Gloria are on their knees on the floor. Before them they have spread a large map or chart. Barnard is enthusiastically out - lining his plans. \nBARNARD \nLook, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here. \nGLORIA \nPipes? Where are you going to get pipes? \nBARNARD \nOh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay. \nThis is as far as they get for George at this moment barges in. \nGEORGE \nThere you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving. \nBARNARD \nLeaving? \nGEORGE \nYes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on! \nBARNARD \nWhen are you going to start? \nGEORGE \nRight this very minute! The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along. \nBARNARD \nI think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip. \nGEORGE \nYou mean you don't want to go? \nBARNARD \nWell - I'm\u0097 \nGEORGE \nI see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh? \nBARNARD \nWell, no. You see, I got this plumbing business\u0097 \nGEORGE \nAll right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you. \n(to Gloria) \nHow about you? \nBARNARD \nOh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey. \n(before she can answer) \nShe'll stick around too. \n(to Gloria) \nIs that right? \nGLORIA \n(beaming) \nIf you want me to! \nBARNARD \nSure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you. \nGEORGE \nAll right, suit yourself. But just remember you had your chance. \nAs he starts out, Lovett enters. \nGEORGE \nHow about you? Do you want to go? \nLOVETT \nGo? Where? \nGEORGE \nHome. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back. \n281. CLOSE TWO SHOT - GEORGE AND LOVETT \nLOVETT \nOh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started. \nGEORGE \n(irritably) \n. . . And that's the whole story, George. He died as peacefully as the passing of a cloud's shadow. His last words to me were, \"I place in your hands, my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La.\" Now you know why I can't leave. \nGeorge listens to him intently, his face a mask of apprehension. He stares at his brother for some time and finally rises and walks around for a few moments. \nGEORGE \n(running his hand through his hair) \nWell, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad. \nCONWAY \nSo you think I'm mad? \nGEORGE \nWhat else can I think after a tale like that? Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century. \nCONWAY \nSo you think it's all nonsense, huh? \n290. MED. SHOT - THE TWO \nGEORGE \nI think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? \nCONWAY \nI don't need any proof. \nGEORGE \n(contemptuously) \nI knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates? \n(some more pacing) \nI can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on-the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible. \nCONWAY \nIs that all my story meant to you? \nGEORGE \nWhat else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk. \nCONWAY \nThen you'd better go, George. This is no place for you. \nGEORGE \nIt's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them? \nCONWAY \nPlease, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore. \nGEORGE \nYou've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility. \nCONWAY \nI'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead. \nGEORGE \n(suddenly) \nIt's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned\u0097 \nCONWAY \nEnough! Never mind the girl! \n(a tense moment of silence) \nWell, why don't you go? \nConway has sunk into a chair. George kneels before him, pleading. \nGEORGE \nLook here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you. \nCONWAY \n(a murmur) \nOh, George . . . \nGEORGE \nBesides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob. \nCONWAY \nGeorge, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you? \nGEORGE \nI'd go mad! \nCONWAY \n(after a moment's hesitation) \nGeorge, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it. \n(warmly) \nYou know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying. \nGEORGE \n(after a long pause) \nWell, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob. \nThey shake hands warmly. George turns to leave. \nCONWAY \n(just as George reaches the door) \nGeorge, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean? \nGEORGE \n(turning back) \nOh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements. \nCONWAY \n(glances up - surprised) \nMaria? \nGEORGE \nYes, the little Russian girl. \nCONWAY \nWhat's she got to do with it? \nGEORGE \nShe's going with me. \nConway looks his extreme amazement. \nCONWAY \n(suddenly - wild) \nGeorge, you're crazy! \nAs he says this he jumps to his feet. George is startled by his tone and manner. \nGEORGE \nShe was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob. \nCONWAY \n(thrown) \nI don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying. \n(wildly) \nYou're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it! \nHe has backed her into a corner and is nearly throttling her. \nCONWAY \nYou're lying, aren't you? \nMARIA \nNo, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now. \nThoroughly disillusioned, Conway emits a few cynical chuckles - shakes his head - stares blankly for a moment. \nCONWAY \n(dead voice) \nYou say the porters are waiting for us? \nGEORGE \nYes. \nCONWAY \nThe clothes? \nGEORGE \n(alertly) \nYes, everything! \nCONWAY \nWhat about the others? \nGEORGE \nI've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them. \nCONWAY \n(business-like) \nCome on! We're wasting time! \nConway dashes around and collects his things. \nMARIA \nAre you taking me? \nCONWAY \nYes, of course. Certainly. Come on! \nThey start out the door and we . . . \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. IN THE GARDEN \n294. MED. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT \nConway, George and Maria on their way out of the main building. The funeral procession continues around them. The two men walk together, Maria behind. George is cheerful and buoyant. \nGEORGE \nIt won't be long now before we're in London. Can't you just see everyone when we pop out of the blue! \nConway's jaw is set grimly. \n295. MED. SHOT \nAs Conway, George and Maria continue. \nGEORGE \nWe'll have them breathless when they hear our story. \nWhile he speaks, Conway turns his head around, looking for a glimpse of Sondra. \n296. MEDIUM SHOT - CHANG \nAs he hurries out of the building and looks out at them from a roof terrace. \n297. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH CONWAY \nAs he continues to look back in Sondra's direction, although he keeps in step with George. \nGEORGE'S VOICE \nYou had me worried for a while. I thought you were gone completely. \nConway turns his head away. \n298. THREE SHOT (MOVING) \nConway, George and Maria. George glances up at Conway. \nGEORGE \n(sincerely - grinning) \nLucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone. \nCONWAY \nWhat was that? \nGEORGE \nI was saying\u0097 \nCONWAY \nCan't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot? \nGeorge looks up, startled. \n299. LONG SHOT \nSondra has come running out to stand anxiously beside Chang. \n300. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nSondra and Chang. \nSONDRA \nWhat's happened? Where's Bob? \nCHANG \nHe's going, my child. \nSONDRA \nGoing? \nCHANG \nBut he will return. \nSONDRA \nOh no! No! Bob! \nShouting, she rushes off and the CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she races down a long flight of stairs, calling out Conway's name. \n301. TRUCKING CLOSEUP - SONDRA \n325. ANOTHER ANGLE \nTo include the girl. \n326. MED. SHOT OF THE THREE \nThe only illumination comes from the moon. We cannot get a clear view of her face. But what we see seems to us to be small, withered and aged. She is dead. The men stare at her intently. \n327. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN \nWho watch her, immobile. George looks despairing. Slowly his head turns toward the cliff behind him - and his eyes become alert with an idea. His face lights up with great determination. He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks away, racing out of scene. \nConway turns sharply and is horrified. \nCONWAY \nGeorge! George! \n328. A SERIES OF SHOTS \nGeorge stumbling toward the cliff, Conway chasing him. George, falling head over heels, rocking on the edge - then plummeting over, falling down, down into the darkness. \n329.

Slowly, he begins to rise and start again. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n332. DAWN \nAs the sun comes up, Conway emerges from the whiteness, feeling his way forward with a walking stick. He walks with the pain and effort of a blind man, and just as he manages to cross a bridge spanning a great chasm, the bridge collapses. He stumbles on. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n333.

From Gainsford. \nASSISTANT SECRETARY \nLet me have it. \n(takes it and reads aloud) \n\"Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri-La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford.\" \n342.

Let me alone! \nHe shrugs his shoulders and slides back into his seat. \n37. FULL SHOT \nAll is silent for a moment. Conway is writing on a small pad - which he rests on an uplifted knee. George is rummaging through a closet - rear of the cabin. \n38. MED. SHOT - GEORGE AND CONWAY \nConway still writes, undisturbed. George reaches into the closet and emerges with a bottle of whiskey. His face lights up. \nGEORGE \n(holds up bottle) \nHello! Look what I found! \nHe crosses to Conway. \nGEORGE \nJust what I needed too. \nCONWAY \n(looks up - smiling) \nYou? \nGEORGE \nJust this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means. \n(hands him cup) \nHere you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me. \n(holds his cup up) \nGentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary. \nConway watches him, amused. George gulps down his drink. \nCONWAY \n(after a slight hesitation - downing his drink) \nHurray! \nGEORGE \nHow I'm going to bask in reflected glory! \n(dreamily) \nPeople are going to point to me and say, \"There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary.\" \nCONWAY \nDon't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle. \nConway takes the bottle from him and pours himself a second drink. \nGEORGE \nThat's why they're sending for you, Bob. With all these foreign entanglements, it was bound to happen. They need you. \nConway, with a poured drink in hand, laughs. \nGEORGE \nAll right, you can laugh if you want to. But who else can they get? Who else is there in all of England half the fighter, half the diplomat, who \nhas half your knowledge of the foreign situation? They can't stop you now, Bob. \nConway moodily pours himself a third. He downs the drink as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PLANE \n39. CLOSE SHOT OF CONWAY \nWe find Conway, asleep in his seat, his head on his hands. George approaches and tenderly spreads a jacket over his shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye. \nCONWAY \n(drunkenly) \nHello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet? \nGEORGE \nYes, Bob. \nCONWAY \nDid you say we saved ninety white people? \nGEORGE \nYes. \nCONWAY \nHurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count. \nGEORGE \nYou'd better try to get some sleep, Bob. \nCONWAY \nJust you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries? \n(confidentially - screws up face) \nYou see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, \"Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?\" So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - \"Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?\" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants\u0097 \n(pause - drily) \n\u0097and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum. \nHe starts to pour himself another drink. \nGEORGE \nYou'd better not drink any more, Bob. You're not talking sense. \nConway downs the drink, and then chuckles cynically. \nCONWAY \nDon't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else. \nGEORGE \nDo try to sleep, Bob. \nCONWAY \nHuh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep. \nHe grunts and squirms. George tucks him in. \nCONWAY \nDid you ever notice the sunrise in China, George? Ah, you should. It's beautiful. \nHe gets settled. George relaxes and, leaning back, shuts his eyes. \n", "test1_true": "It is quiet. All are asleep. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY until it reaches the glass panel leading to the cockpit.

FULL SHOT \nAll are asleep except Lovett, who fidgets on his seat. Then Barnard stirs - opens his eyes - and stretches. As he does so, he sees that Lovett is awake. \nBARNARD \nGood morning, Lovey. \nLOVETT \nI beg your pardon. \nBARNARD \nI say, good morning, Lovey. \nLOVETT \nGood morning\u0097 \n(catches himself) \nLook here, young man. \nBARNARD \nEh? \nLOVETT \nI didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P. \nBARNARD \nI see. \nLOVETT \nI see. \nBARNARD \nWell, it's a good morning, anyway. \nLOVETT \nI'm never conversational before I coffee. \nBarnard glances out of the window, looks around outside thoughtfully. \nBARNARD \nWait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be travelling east, aren't we? \nLOVETT \nWhy, of course. Yes. \nBARNARD \nWell, it looks to me as if we're travelling west. \nLOVETT \nThat's ridiculous. \nBARNARD \nIs it? \nLOVETT \nIt certainly is. \nBARNARD \nLook here\u0097 \nLOVETT \nAny child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south\u0097 \nBARNARD \nI always get it twisted because I'm left-handed. \nLOVETT \nOh, really? \nBARNARD \nYes. \nLOVETT \nWell, you just reverse it. Your left hand is\u0097 \n(tries to explain - gets confused and irritated) \nWhat difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north! \nBARNARD \nUh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it. \nLOVETT \nNow you're irritating and absurd! \n44. CLOSE SHOT - LOVETT \nAs he sulks by himself, looks around - locates the sun in back of him - smiles - satisfied he's right, throws a condescending glance over at Barnard - then suddenly his face clouds - the whole thing dawns on him. \nLOVETT \n(jumps up shrieking) \nOh, my word - of course - yes. Boy! Boy, we're travelling in the wrong direction! Wake up! We're going in the wrong direction! \n45. FULL SHOT \nConway is still asleep. \nGEORGE \n(concerned for Conway) \nCouldn't you arrange to make a little less noise? \nLOVETT \nI tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here! \nGEORGE \nBe quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing. \nLOVETT \n(not quite reassured) \nIt's Fenner. \nBARNARD \nHe might have lost his way. \n", "test2_input": "LOVETT \nOf course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] \nDuring this George has been looking around - he rises. \nGEORGE \nAll right, all right. Calm yourself. I'll talk to Fenner. \nHe crosses to panel leading to cockpit, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. When he gets there he knocks on the window. \nGEORGE \nFenner! I - I say\u0097 \nGeorge knocks again. From the cockpit side - the small shade suddenly snaps up - and George finds himself staring into the face of the mysterious pilot. He takes an instinctive step backward. The pilot turns his head. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as George keeps backing up until he gets to Conway. George turns to Conway and shakes his shoulder. \nGEORGE \nBob! Bob! \nConway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens his eyes, yawns and stretches. Throughout it, George speaks. \nGEORGE \nWake up! Something's happened! It isn't Fenner in the cockpit! \nConway looks at him, glances off toward the others, and back at George. \nCONWAY \n(dismissing him with a gesture) \nOh, stop it! \nGEORGE \nThe bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something. \nBARNARD \nWe're nowhere near Shanghai. We're going in the opposite direction. \nThis interests Conway and he looks out of the window. \nCONWAY \nWe're over the desert. That's funny. \nThen rising, he crosses to cockpit. The others watch him expectantly. \n46. GROUP SHOT - AROUND COCKPIT \nConway pounds on the panel. The face of the pilot appears in sight. Conway tries to ask him something in Chinese. The pilot glares at them for a second, then a gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively they back away. \nCONWAY \nCharming chap. \nBARNARD \n(not being funny) \nNice puss to meet in a dark alley. \nThe ship lurches - and they are thrown off balance. The panel has been snapped shut. \nCONWAY \nWell, that's that, I guess. \nBARNARD \nWonder what's happened to Fenner. \nLOVETT \nYes. And who is he ? How'd he get there? \nBARNARD \nDo you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots? \nCONWAY \nNo. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened. \nLOVETT \nOf course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long. \nCONWAY \n(with finality) \nThat fellow got on at Baskul. \nLOVETT \nWhat's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know. \nGeorge, who has disappeared during the above, now returns, with a monkey wrench in his hand. Conway stops him. \nCONWAY \nGeorge, what are you going to do? \nGEORGE \nI'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is. \nLOVETT \nGood. \nCONWAY \nWhat if he refuses? \nLOVETT \nWe'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do. \nCONWAY \nBrilliant! \n(a sweeping gesture) \nCan anyone here fly a plane? \nThere is a general chorus of \"no\u0097not I,\" etc. \nCONWAY \n(takes wrench from George's hand) \nWell, George, that's no good. \nConway throws the monkey wrench into a corner. \nCONWAY \nI guess we're in for it. \nLOVETT \nIn for what? \nCONWAY \nI don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner. \n(starts for his seat) \nWhen he lands, we'll find out. \nLOVETT \nYou mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land? \nCONWAY \nWhat do you suggest? \n", "test2_true": "Why, you - you\u0097 Look here - he may dash us to pieces! \nCONWAY \nIt might afford you a great deal of relief. \n(sitting) \nNow gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream. \n(curling up) \nAs soon as he lands, let me know. \nHe shuts his eyes and leans back.

What about some double solitaire? \nLOVETT \nAs a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire. \nBARNARD \nNo kidding? \nLOVETT \nYes. \nBARNARD \nThen I'm your man. \n(starts away) \nCome on, Toots. \nLovett detests the pet names, but follows. George thinks a moment - and crosses to balcony. \nEXT. BALCONY \n151. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway is listening moodily to the soulful music. George wanders in beside him. \nCONWAY \nHello, George. \n(looking out) \nCigarette? \nGEORGE \nThanks. \n(lights the cigarette - after a pause) \nI suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure. \nCONWAY \nWe've had plenty of it the last few days. \nGEORGE \nIt's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all. \nCONWAY \nOh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything. \n(moodily) \nI think I'm going to like it here. \nGEORGE \nYou talk as though you intend on staying. \nCONWAY \n(turns to him) \nSomething happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before? \nGEORGE \nWhat are you talking about? \nCONWAY \n(back to earth) \nI don't know. \nGEORGE \nYou're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill. \n152. TWO SHOT - CONWAY AND GEORGE \nConway's point of view, studying George. \nCONWAY \nDon't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill? \nGEORGE \nWhat could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now. \nCONWAY \nOf course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father. \nGEORGE \nWhat do you mean if we should get out? \nCONWAY \n(evasively) \nDid I say \"if\"? \nGEORGE \n(interrupting) \nThat's what you said. \nCONWAY \nWell - I mean\u0097 \nGEORGE \nWhat's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here. \n153. CLOSE TWO SHOT - FAVORING CONWAY \nCONWAY \nGeorge, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us? \n", "test3_true": "(catching on) \nChang's first question was about the pilot. \nCONWAY \nUh-huh. \nGEORGE \nThere must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that? \nCONWAY \nThat's what's on the other side of the hill. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN \nEXT. OF VALLEY - DAY \n154. LONG SHOT FROM A TOWER ROOM \nShooting over shoulders of two men in f.g. \nWe see a beautiful picture of the valley below. There is a tranquility here that is beatific. CAMERA PULLS BACK. The two men are revealed as Conway and Chang. They stand on a terrace of one of the tower rooms. \nCHANG \nIt's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La. \nCONWAY \nWho and what is Shangri-La? You? \nCHANG \nGoodness, no! \nCHANG \nSo there are others? \nCHANG \nOh, yes. \nCONWAY \nWho, for instance? \nCHANG \nIn time you will meet them all. \n155. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO - FAVORING CONWAY \nHe watches Chang's face searchingly, then smiles. \nCONWAY \nFor a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be. \nCHANG \n(laughs) \nThere are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss. \nCONWAY \nYou know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it. \nCHANG \n(evasively) \nShall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures. \nINT. A TOWER \n156. FOLLOW SHOT WITH GEORGE \nOn a spiral staircase. Looking surreptitiously around, he backs his way up. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM as he reaches the top of the landing. Here he stops and glances around the corner down a corridor. \nINT. CORRIDOR \n157. MEDIUM SHOT \nCAMERA FOLLOWS GEORGE as he peers into several rooms searchingly. He finally arrives at one and enters. \nINT. A ROOM \n158. FULL SHOT \nGeorge enters and looks around. It is dimly lit and apparently unoccupied. He crosses to a desk and picks up several objects, scrutinizing them closely. \n159. CLOSE SHOT OF THE GIRL, MARIA - IN ALCOVE \nShe sits, a tapestry board on her lap, watching George with keen interest. \n160. CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE \nHe opens a book and glances at its contents. \n161. MED. SHOT TO INCLUDE BOTH \nMaria surveys his back appraisingly. \nMARIA \nGood afternoon. \nGeorge wheels around, startled, and stares at her intently. \nGEORGE \n(starts backing out) \nExcuse me\u0096 \nMARIA \n(appealingly) \nPlease don't go. \nGeorge hesitates at door. \nMARIA \nTea will be served any moment. \n162. CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE \nHe watches her with grave speculation for a long moment, then slowly moves toward her. \nMARIA \n(a winning smile) \nWon't you come in? \nGeorge still maintains a serious mien, as their eyes meet. \nMARIA \nMy name is Maria. Won't you sit down? \nINT. LIBRARY \n163. FULL SHOT \nIt is a huge room. The walls are lined with impressive tomes. Chang is showing Conway around. \n164. MEDIUM SHOT \nConway has just finished browsing through one of the books. \nCONWAY \nBy the way, what religion do you follow here? \nCHANG \n"}

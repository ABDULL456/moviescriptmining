MITCHELL (in a low voice) You'd make a great poker player, kid. 
NICOLE wheels herself over to her father. 
NICOLE Let's go, Daddy. 
EXT. COMMUNITY CENTRE -- DAY 
NICOLE is in the car in front of the community centre.  She stares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps. 
NICOLE (voice over) Daddy took a long time.  I guess he wanted to have a few words with you. He must have tried to tell you that I was lying.  Then you would tell Daddy that it didn't matter if I was lying or not, the lawsuit is dead. 
As NICOLE'S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and MITCHELL arguing is seen. 
The movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLE'S voice over. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) Everyone's lawsuit is dead.  Forget it.  Tell the others to forget it. It's over.  Right now, Sam, the thing you've got to worry about is why she lied.  A kid who'd do that to her own father is not normal, Sam. 
SAM comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down at the driver's seat.  NICOLE stares at him as he starts the car. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) But Daddy knows who lied.  He knows who the liar is.  He knows who's normal. 
SAM stares ahead, not knowing what to do next. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (speaking to SAM) I hope he lets us keep the computer. 
SAM turns to look at NICOLE. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) I'd like an ice cream. 
CUT TO 
INT. AIRPORT. -- MORNING 
MITCHELL is at the baggage section of the arrival area, waiting for his luggage. 
He watches PETER, the man he met in the washroom changing his daughter, playing with the little girl. 
PETER is full of love as he swings the little girl into the air as she laughs. 
MITCHELL is caught in a daydream, smiling at the happy image of father and daughter.  ALISON approaches him. 
ALISON Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens. 
MITCHELL Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally. 
ALISON Alison. 
MITCHELL Alison. 
ALISON Say hi to Zoe. 
MITCHELL I will. 
ALISON I hope she gets better. 
MITCHELL I'll tell her that. 
ALISON shakes MITCHELL'S hand, and leaves. 
CUT TO 
EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY 
SAM wheels NICOLE along a path away from the same concession stand that was seen at the beginning of the film.  NICOLE is licking an ice-cream cone.  Around them, people are setting up the bandstand. 
NICOLE Daddy, can we come to the fair? 
SAM Yes. 
NICOLE How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.

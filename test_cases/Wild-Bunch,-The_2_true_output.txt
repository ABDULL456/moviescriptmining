EXT. HACIENDA COURTYARD - DAY 
506 IN THE COURTYARD A SMALL GROUP OF WOMEN wrapped in. black robosas are burning candles and moving. among the dead bodies. that spill out of the large room of the hacienda and into the yard. It is a scene of carnage, blood now black in.the sun, a million flies and the walls lined with waiting vultures. There is no sign of soldiers anywhere.. A few of the bodies have been dragged into the courtyard. Most, including Pike, Dutch and the others, including Mapache, lie where they fell. 
507 THE BOUNTY HUNTERS, LED BY THORNTON, RIDE UP TO THE ARCHES AND DISMOUNT, their horses snorting nervously at the smell of blood and the stench of death. At-the end of the courtyard where five corpses are heaped in a small Di13, a lone vulture stands. patiently near them. As the bounty hunters approach and the-.bird labors reluctantly into flight, the men dismount. Thornton, looking in through the broken wall, turns away. Coffer and T.C. enter, whistle softly.. 
COFFER It's them. 
THORNTON You'd have.one hell of a time proving that.a week from now, in Texas. 
-COFFER. We could try...Hell, a pelt's a pelt, it don't matter what condition it's in. 
T.C. Picked clean -- not a gun on 'em.,. Thornton walks slowly among the bodies.

THORNTON (walking away) Suit yourself, 
T.C. We going to wait here for Jess or meet him on the way? But Thornton doesn't answer; reaching his horse, he mounts and. rides away. Coffer and T.C,. and Ross look after him.. 
ROSS (pointing to the bird on the walk) If Jess is counting on buzzards to. lead him to. old Sykes, he's got a long wait -- we got 'em all.. They laugh and go to work.

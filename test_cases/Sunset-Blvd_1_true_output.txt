Connie is looking at the house numbers. 
CONNIE Here's ten thousand seventy-nine, Betty.  It must be over there. 
Betty turns the car into the driveway of Norma's place, stops at the entrance steps.  Betty gets out. 
CONNIE Betty, let me come along with you.  Please. 
BETTY No, I'll be all right. 
She shuts the door of the car and goes up the steps. 
E-30    NORMA'S BEDROOM 
Norma lies on the bed.  Gillis sits in a far corner of the room, motionless. 
NORMA (In a whimpering monotone) I love you, Joe.  I love you, Joe. I love you, Joe.  I love you, Joe. 
There is the sound of footsteps below and the ringing of a doorbell.  Gillis rises. 
NORMA What are you going to do, Joe? 
Without a word, he leaves the room.  Norma raises herself on the bed, reaching for a black negligee lying at the foot of it.  As she does so, she dis- lodges her pillow a little, revealing a revolver hidden beneath it. 
E-31    DOWNSTAIRS HALL, THE DESMOND HOUSE (DARK) 
Max crosses the hall, putting on his alpaca jacket. He turns on the lights.  Outside stands Betty. From the staircase comes - 
GILLIS' VOICE It's all right, Max.  I'll take it. 
MAX Yes, sir. 
He stands back as Gillis opens the door. 
GILLIS Hello, Betty. 
BETTY (On the threshold) I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful? 
GILLIS Come on in, Betty, 
Betty enters.  As he leads her into the living room, Gillis puts his arm around her shoulders. 
GILLIS Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here. 
BETTY This is where you live? 
GILLIS You bet. 
BETTY Whose house is it? 
They have reached 
E-32    THE LIVING ROOM 
Gillis leads Betty in. 
GILLIS Hers. 
BETTY Whose? 
GILLIS Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond. 
BETTY That was Norma Desmond on the phone? 
GILLIS Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar. 
BETTY Why did she call me?

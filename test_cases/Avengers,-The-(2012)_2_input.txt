TONY Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? 
LOKI Stalling me won't change anything. 
TONY No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one. 
LOKI The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear? 
TONY 
THE AVENGERS. (Loki looks at him, confused) It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES' type of thing. 
LOKI Yes, I've met them. 
TONY 
(SMILING) Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. 
TONY (CONT'D) But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them. 
LOKI That was the plan. 
TONY Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE BRACELETS, a honing device. 
LOKI I have an army. 
TONY We have a HULK. 
LOKI I thought the beast had wandered off. 
TONY You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it. 
LOKI (slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you? Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing. Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING. 
LOKI It should work. 
TONY Well, performance issues. You know? In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room. 
TONY Jarvis. Anytime now. Loki grabs Tony by the throat again. 
LOKI You will all fall before me. LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower. From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out. The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit. It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry. 
IRON MAN And there's one other person you pissed off! His name was Phil. Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on his ass. 
EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY 
Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up 
ANOTHER PORTAL. 
EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE 
A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on the end. 
INSIDE THE SUIT 
TONY Right. Army. IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN flies towards the city. 
EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY 
The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame. 
AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF 
BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF 
EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE. 
EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY 
Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER. Loki turns to his ENEMY. 
THOR Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it! 
LOKI You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only the war!

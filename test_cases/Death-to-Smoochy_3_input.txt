On a large screen TV the smiling Asian face of Takashi Yamashita, who's singing Cole Porter's "I Get a Kick Out of You" in Japanese. 
CUT BACK to reveal Takashi wearing a white sequined tuxedo with tails as he plays a white grand piano. He looks like an Asian Liberace. He is circled by a group of Japanese children who sing along with him. 
CHICK (V.O.) 'Takashi Sings Tin Pan Alley for Youngsters' is the hottest show on Japanese television. The sweat shops are working overtime trying to keep up with the demand. Record albums, toys, cereal, tee shirts, you name it... 
INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY 
Several tough-looking Asian men -- CHICK, SAMBO, and TOBI -- Takashi's management group -- sits in Stokes' office. Takashi sits quietly in the corner. Stokes sits behind his desk, sipping his trademark glass of wine. 
CHICK Look, Stokes, let's cut the bullshit. We want Takashi in that Smoochy slot and we're willing to do whatever it takes to get it. 
STOKES Pardon me for saying this, but for a non-resident of this country, you speak impeccable English. 
CHICK I'm originally from Teaneck. 
STOKES Ah. 
CHICK We own every hair on this bastard's head and we're willing to share a few strands... if you get my drift. 
STOKES Well, it's not that simple. I have an executive board to answer to. I wish I could just snap my fingers and make a deal but -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHICK You mean like this? 
Chick snaps his fingers and Tobi, the third Asian guy, walks over and drops a duffel bag on Stokes' desk. 
STOKES Oh my.   And what is this on my desk? 
CHICK Two hundred grand in a Louis Vuitton duffle bag. Get our boy the slot and we'll round it off to a million. And you can keep the luggage. 
Stokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his desk. 
CHICK You're dealing with an honorable culture, Frank. We know how to play ball. 
Stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money.     He looks up at Chick and smiles. 
STOKES Gentlemen, I suddenly feel invigorated and full of hope. 
Chick smiles. 
INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
On Nora's TV screen, we see the black and white image of Rickets the Hippo doing the "Klunky-Wunky Dance." Nora sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen. There is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up and ejects the "Best of Rickets" tape. She opens the door. To her surprise, Randolph is standing there. 
RANDOLPH Hiya, cutie! 
Before she can respond, he enters the apartment and takes off his jacket. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH So here's the good news: Yes, I'll be happy to end my sabbatical and return to my old slot. I know you and Frank are in a bind, so I'll start Monday. Call wardrobe, call props, tell 'em the R man is back and he's ready to start whistlin' dem happy tunes for da little chillens. 
He flops down on the couch. 
RANDOLPH Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get a Scotch around here? 
He laughs. 
NORA You've got three seconds to pry your ass off my couch and get out. 
Randolph jumps to his feet. 
RANDOLPH Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone! You need that slot filled and I'm ready to reclaim what's rightfully mine. 
NORA Just in case you forgot, you're a criminal and a scumbag. 
RANDOLPH Okay, so maybe I commandeered a stray shekel or two. Big deal! Compared to what Smoochy did that's like jerking off in the supermarket. 
NORA Where do you shop? 
Randolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders. 
RANDOLPH Come on. Have you lost all affection for me? After what we once had? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NORA That was a long time ago.    I was young and stupid.

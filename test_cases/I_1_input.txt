OPEN ON: 
Rain. Lashing a windowpane. A PIANO PLAYS somewhere off screen. Beethoven's Fur Elise. 
INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY 
A little boy gazes out into the storm. Nervous, eager, sweet. Meet GEORGE DENBROUGH (9). 
GEORGE You sure it's not too bad out there? 
Will (13), his older brother,   sits up in bed propped against a pile of pillows, surrounded   by tissues and sheets of newspaper. HEADLINES and TOYS   tell us this is the late 80's -- October, 1987 to be exact. He   puts finishing touches on 
A PAPER BOAT 
WILL Don't be such a wuss. I'd come if I weren't dying. Now get the paraffin. 
GEORGE In the cellar? 
WILL You want it to float or not, Georgie? Go on. Storm's not gonna last forever. 
GEORGE Okay, Willy. 
George jumps up obediently and goes.

TITLE CARD: 
OCTOBER 1987 
INT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY 
George hurries downstairs. He catches a glimpse of their mother, SHARON DENBROUGH (30s) in the parlor playing piano, an earthy beauty transported to another world while she plays. 
INT. KITCHEN - WILL'S HOUSE - DAY 
George's stomach sinks as he comes face to face with THE CELLAR DOOR -- the only thing between George and the monster in the basement of his imagination -- IT. 
INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A WALKIE-TALKIE SQUAWKS next to Will. The sarcastic walkie- talkie filtered voice of RICHIE "TRASHMOUTH" TOZIER (12), his neighbor, filters through the plastic speaker. 
RICHIE (WALKIE-TALKIE FILTERED) Willy-boy. 
Will, annoyed, picks up the walkie-talkie.   While looking through his rain blasted window. 
WILL Trashmouth. 
They wave at each other. Richie, bug-eyed glasses, turns the wave into a middle-finger. 
RICHIE (O.S.) Thought you were sick. 
WILL I am. 
RICHIE (O.S.) Is it mortal? 
INT. CELLAR DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Flinging it open, George ventures his arm into the DARK VOID. He gropes around and finds the LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. George snatches his arm back. 
GEORGE Oh, balls. The power. 
The dark basement glares back at him, taunting. 
HERE WE DO SOME SORT OF CALL FROM WILL UPSTAIRS THAT IS A "CODE" THEY DO WITH EACH OTHER. THIS WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT US LATER. 
INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
GEORGIE RESPONDS WITH HIS OWN CALL FROM DOWNSTAIRS 
RICHIE (O.S.) What was that? 
Will coughs hard into a tissue. Half-impatient, half-joking: 
WILL Nothing. Georgie and I are making a paper boat. Got to go- 
RICHIE Wait-! 
Will turns off the walkie-talkie. 
INT. KITCHEN - WILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
George rubs the gooseflesh on his arms. 
GEORGE (TO HIMSELF) I'm getting it. I'm going to get it. I'm going in. I'm... 
He steels himself and plunges into the void. 
INT. CELLAR - WILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
George scrambles down four steps to THE CELLAR SHELF and sifts through junk as fast as he can: SHOE-POLISH, RAGS, a dusty bag of colored BALLOONS, a broken FLASHLIGHT, two mostly empty bottles of WINDEX, and an old can of TURTLE WAX.

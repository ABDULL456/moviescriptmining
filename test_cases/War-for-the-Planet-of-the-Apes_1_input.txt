BAD APE (nods) Listen to human... 
His face abruptly contorts into an "angry human" expression -- he waves a chiding finger as he mimics: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) "Bad ape!    Bad ape!" 
Then, turning his head, he realizes the Girl has the shiny Chevy Nova emblem again -- he reaches for it, possessive: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) (gently admonishes) No... No touch. 
She stares at it longingly as he sets it down. He looks back at the apes, smiles -- then rushes away for something else... 
The apes all watch their excitable host, perplexed -- Maurice turns to Caesar, signs an aside: 
MAURICE [Amazing... Always thought we were the only ones. Wonder if there are others out there somewhere? Others like us.] 
Just as Caesar begins to contemplate the mind-blowing thought, Bad Ape bounds back in, hurriedly passing out packages of vacuum-foiled food rations (M.R.E.'s). 
BAD APE Here! Eat, eat! (beaming) New friends. Special day. 
Bad Ape tears the top off one, starts eating the dehydrated food, nodding encouragingly for them to do the same. 
Caesar looks slowly down at the ration in his hand -- notices an official military seal: "U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY: CA STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER" CUT TIGHTER on the word: BORDER. Caesar suddenly looks up: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
CAESAR Where did you get this? 
Bad Ape turns to him, confused. Caesar holds up the package. Bad Ape looks uneasy... his voice lowering to a hush: 
BAD APE Bad place. Very bad. I find. Long time ago. After zoo. Looking for food. Find human zoo. Zoo for sick. 
Engrossed, Caesar's eyes meet his... as Bad Ape continues: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) Big walls. Sick humans try climb. Bad humans kill. Then get sick too. All dead now. All dead. 
Caesar and the others take this in, somehow haunted.   Then: 
CAESAR Bad humans...? Soldiers? 
Bad Ape recognizes the word, nods gravely: 
BAD APE Soldiers. 
The posse looks to each other with rising intensity... 
ROCKET [An old, deserted military camp on the border...?] 
LUCA [Maybe this is where the Colonel and the troops from the north are going to meet?] 
Caesar nods: maybe.    He turns back to Bad Ape. 
CAESAR Is it far?     Can you take us? 
BAD APE (looks agog) Human zoo?! No... No go back there. Everyone dead. I come here. Safe here. Never go back! 
Caesar reaches out his hand, places it on Bad Ape's shoulder: 
CAESAR Please.     You must take us. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
BAD APE No!     Can not take!   Can not take! 
Scared, he pushes Caesar's hand from his shoulder, a little too hard -- Rocket GRABS him, incensed Â­- but Caesar restrains Rocket, shakes his head no. Bad Ape shrinks in Rocket's grasp -- then sees something, and points desperately to the little windows along the wall -- 
BAD APE (CONT'D) Look! More snow! Can not go, must stay here. (to the others) Look, look! 
They all look to the massive lobby window to see it is indeed snowing hard now. 
Rocket finally releases Bad Ape.     He exhales, looks at them with renewed optimism. 
BAD APE (CONT'D) You stay here. Eat. Rest. (smiles hopefully) With me. 
Caesar considers, reluctantly nods to the others. Bad Ape is relieved -- when he sees the Girl staring longingly again at the Nova emblem; he grabs it, hands it to her ceremoniously: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) Here.    You keep. 
He looks around, smiling at the apes for approval; the Girl gazes happily at the emblem, as with a WHISTLING HOWL, we -- 
CUT TO: 
HIGH OVER THE CAVERNOUS LOBBY - MIDDLE OF NIGHT 
Snow whirling hard through the ice palace.        HOLD; CUT TO: 
NEAR THE HEARTH - SAME 
The last embers of the fire dying out as everyone sleeps... 
CLOSE ON CAESAR 
The only one still awake.    He sits up, eyes settling on --

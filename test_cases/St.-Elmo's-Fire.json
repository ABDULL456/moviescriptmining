ALEC NEWBERRY, a handsome possessor of The Right Stuff, his beautiful roommate LESLIE HUNTER, KEVIN DOLENZ, self-styled, chain- smoking, sardonic, and KIRBO KREAGER, short, hyper, dressed like a waiter -- dash worriedly into the busy emergency room. They are all twenty-two, or barely twenty-two. Only four months out of college, they are in their freshman year of life. Alec, Leslie, Kevin and Kirbo dash past a cubicle, where a totally naked, three-hundred-pound man paces in a daze. Past this, they find a black nurse talking with two COPS. \nALEC Wendy Beamish and Billy Hicks? They were in a car accident? \nELECTRIC DOORS zip open again, introducing JULIANNA VAN PATTER (JULES), another freshman in life, but her sleek style gives her a certain sexual sophistication. She is accompanied by her dark, interesting DATE as she joins her friends and the Cops. \nJULES They're dead, aren't they? Everyone ignores her as Alec hands his card to the Cops. \nALEC Officers, I'm Alec Newberry with Congressman Langston's office. Leslie whispers to Jules, while Alec and the Cops talk. \nLESLIE I think they're okay. \nJULES Thank God. \n(BEAT) Are you aware there's a three- hundred-pound man walking around naked? \n(CONTINUED) \n1 CONTINUED: 1 WENDY BEAMISH, a sweet-faced, insecure preppy, emerges from a first-aid room with a bandaged forehead. \nHER FRIENDS Wendy. Oh, my God. Are you all right??? \nWENDY I'm fine. It's the car my father gave me for graduation that's totalled. \nALEC \n(TO KEVIN) Find Billy. See if you can sober him up. Kevin always does what Alec tells him to. Meanwhile, Wendy pulls out her Visa card and speaks to the nurse. \nWENDY How much do I owe you? \nJULES He almost killed you. Destroyed your car, and you're paying...? \nLESLIE Jules, please. As Leslie comforts her, Wendy is looking over Jules' Date who hovers in the distance. \nWENDY Is that your date? The naked man wanders past them. \nJULES No, that's my date! As usual, Jules has managed to make Wendy laugh, Just as the Cops approach her. \nCOP # 1 You pressing charges? \nWENDY No. \nKI RBO 'I'm Mr. Hicks' legal counsel and he's not required to take any tests. \n(CONTINUED) \n1 CONTINUED: (2) 0 \nCOP 1 You're a little late, Counselor.

She could black out at any second... I'll call you... Jules joins Leslie and Wendy. \nLESLIE He's cute. \nJULES Too young... and don't you both start on your father complex theory. \n2 EXT. MEDICAL CENTER 2 \nAlec and Kirbo follow the Cops toward a mobile van. \nKIRBO We're dealing with a first offender here, and since Ms. Beamish doesn't want to press charges, whaddya say we just let this one slide, Officers? They reach the back of the mobile van, where we see BILLY HICKS, a handsome daredevil, playing his saxophone, wearing handcuffs, for two good-looking nurses and Kevin, who is trying to give him black coffee. \nBILLY Alec, could you kinds burn a little rubber? Alec turns the corner as Billy continues. \nBILLY Thanks for bailing me out. \nJULES Again. \n7 EXT. ST. ELMO'S BAR - NIGHT 7 \nA local hangout for those primarily in their twenties.

Wait 'til my father hears the car is totalled. \nBILLY I'm gonna get you a new car, Wendy. Everyone screams in disbelief as they go into St. Elmo's. Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin holds the door open, but no one thanks him. \nKEVIN You're welcome. You're welcome. A young, burned-out UNDERGRAD (CLAYTON) follows. \nKEVIN You're not welcome, Clayton. How's school? \nCLAYTON Baroque. Thank you very much.

It has to get worse before it gets better. \n8 INT. ST. ELMO'S - HIGHT 8 \nYoung professionals, graduate students, and precocious undergrads populate the P.J. Clarke-like bar/restaurant. Kirbo quickly goes back to work waiting tables. Alec gets rid of a group of rowdy undergrads sitting at two tables pushed together. He admonishes WALLY, the burly owner. \nALEC Wally! You let undergrad punks at our tables??? \nWALLY Relax, Alec... they've only been there ten minutes. \nALEC Yeah, well, we've been here for four years. Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin and Billy (still with sax around his neck) take their usual chairs as Kirbo drops off a large pitcher of beer. \nBILLY Hey, I need a real drink. Kirbo is long gone. Kevin pours. \nKEVIN Waiters are like cops. Never around when you need one. Kevin and Alec begin bouncing quarters from the edge of a table into their beers -- obviously some ritual. \nBILLY Will somebody get me a screwdriver? \nJULES And a hammer. \nALEC You know what it means to have a suspended license for drunk driving on your record? \n(CONTINUED) \nST.

Alec grabs him and shoves his head in the toilet. \nALEC Why didn't you tell me you blew another job? \nBILLY For some insane reason I thought you'd take it badly. Kevin and Kirbo rush in. \nKEVIN Don't drown him, he's a father. Alec releases Billy who comes up with his hair wet and gives Alec a major shove. \nALEC That's right, you are a father and when are you gonna grow up? \nBILLY Like this was real mature, Al? They all start to laugh. Alec softens. \n(CONTINUED) \nST.

He shakes his head, showering them with toilet water. \nKEVIN Why do they put ice cubes in the urinals? \nKIRBO It tastes better. \n13 OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM 13 Leslie, Jules and Wendy wait anxiously, but the guys emerge, pals forever again.

Right near Lockheed. Open some wine. \nKEVIN Looks like it could be put together with Leggo blocks. You design this? \n.LESLIE I did all the mechanicals for one of our senior architects and I think he's going to promote me to the design staff. Kevin is fighting with a ridiculous wine opener. \nKEVIN Maybe you could design a corkscrew that actually works. Everything in this apartment comes from Scandinavia. They don't even have wine in Scandinavia. Naturally Leslie opens it in a flash. \nKEVIN Do you think my attachment to Alec is unnatural? \nLESLIE No, I think mine is. We've only just started to live together and he's already pushing for 'the wedding.' \nKEVIN Well, since you fell in love with a Democrat and now he's a Republican, I think all bets are off. \n(CONTINUED) \nST. ELMO'S FIRE - Rev. 10/1/84 26. \n32 CONTINUED: 32 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Leslie burns herself and shouts. \nLESLIE How do some women do this every night of their lives and not go insane? \nKEVIN They are insane. Wives, husbands, children, love, marriage, relationship. It's all insane. \nLESLIE That's what I'm afraid of. Did I tell you that my perfect sister and her perfect husband are getting a perfect divorce-? \nKEVIN I have the perfect cure. Stay away from love. He finds the butter and puts some on her hand. \nLESLIE You must have been in love, once. You like hot peppers? \nKEVIN Doesn't Alec hate them? \nLESLIE Insurrection... Now, come on, Kevin, you must have been in love with somebody, sometime... \nKEVIN Once, in junior high. I played guitar in a group and fellin love with our singer who did 'We've Only Just Begun' as sweet as Karen Carpenter. I got high on cheap champagne and pledged my love. Next day she ran off with the bass player named Rocky and I traded my guitar in for a battered Underwood typewriter. \nLESLIE On which you will type your way to being one of the most important writers in America. \n(CONTINUED) \nST.

Taking out shreds of papers and napkins. \nKEVIN I can't seem to organize any of my thoughts into anything of any substance. \nLESLIE Maybe you need to stop thinking so much and fall in love again. \nKEVIN Love stinks. The door opens and Alec arrives home. \nALEC Hi, guys. He kisses Leslie. \nKEVIN Rough day with the right wing, dear? Alec hands Leslie a red box. She opens it excitedly and finds a black lace nightgown. She screams as Alec heads for the kitchen. \nALEC Try it on... Leslie makes naughty eyes at Kevin and disappears into the bedroom. \nALEC Leslie has to marry me, soon. \nWOMAN Jus' give me my check. Wendy hands her the check. \nWOMAN You get some hot clothes, get yourself a man... you won't be worryin' about all this shit. She leaves as Billy arrives in time to check her out. \nBILLY Welfare recipients are getting better-looking these days. \nWENDY Ever feel like you're not accomplishing anything? Billy sits on her desk. \nBILLY I think I'm in touch with the feeling. Let's go get a drink. \nWEND Y Billy, why aren't you at work? Billy gives her a look she knows all too well. \n35 INT. ST.

But maybe you could help me find another job. \nWEND-Y Do you have any interest in the janitorial field? They both smile. \nWENDY You should be playing your music. Billy... \nBILLY I'm a family man and the rent is due. Alec, followed by Kevin, storms into the bar and attacks Billy. \nALEC You dumb shit. You have to start making passes at the women you're supposed to be polling? \nBILLY Actually, they were the ones who suggested another type of polin'...

Alec follows. \nALEC I didn't bargain for you turning out this way. \nBILLY And I didn't bargain for you turning into a pompous politico. Suckin' up to Hodges. That's it, Al, isn't it?... You've become a Republican!!! \nALEC And you've become a drunk. \nBILLY Oh, no, not just 'a' drunk, Big Al. One of the great drunks! Born, bred and diseased in the s \nU.S.A. \n(TO WENDY) Come on... \n(TO KEVIN) You with us, Kev...? Kevin hesitates. \nBILLY Oh, I forgot, Kev. You don't do anything Alec doesn't tell you to do. Well, that's-okay, 'cause just remember one thing. You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose. Billy leaves.

But instead, he took me to dinner -- several times. \nLESLIE I was wondering why you haven't been sleeping over. Jules, I don't think you should start bopping your boss. \nJULES Too late, Leslie.

I bop him for a few years -- get his job when he gets caught with his hand in the vault. I become a legend -- do a black mink ad, but get caught in a sex scandal. Retire in massive disgrace -- but write a huge bestseller and become the star of my own talk show. \nWENDY Silly of us to be concerned. \nJULES And besides, Forrester suggested some fabulous alternatives for my stepmonster... \nWENDY That's another thing. You seem obsessed with this woman's dying.

Judith disappears into the bedroom as Dale puts out the garbage. Kirbo sits for a moment alone, stunned. Dale returns. \nDALE And here's the worst of all... When I first decided to be a doctor, I thought it was because I wanted to serve people. But now, well, I'm beginning to get this funny feeling that what medicine's really all about is money... You want some coffee? \nMIRBO It's money, isn't it? That's what you're trying to tell me. It's 'cause I don't have any money! Thank you for being so honest.

Little buddy... little traitor. Huh, what'd you tell her? \nLESLIE He told me nothing. It was just a hunch... until now. Alec filled with guilt and remorse becomes angrier. Alec realizes that everybody in the house is watching him. He must save face. \nALEC Leslie, I want you out of the apartment tonight. Alec marches out the door. The place is a wreck. \nKirbo drives frantically. As snowflakes begin to hit the windshield, he grabs for the windshield wiper. Not knowing how it works, he forces it the wrong way.

Somehow as they roll and turn, the rug gets wrapped around them. Leslie tears at his shirt, as he yanks her sweater off. Kevin fights madly with the back of Leslie's bra. He is going berserk trying to find the clasp. \nLESLIE No... it's in front. With a flick of her hand she undoes her bra and opens up the wonders of paradise to her old buddy.

Everyone cheers except Alec. \nALEC I gotta get back to work. \nKIRBO Since when do you work on Saturdays? \nLESLIE Since he started volunteer moonlighting for Senator Hodges. \nKI RBO What is the three-year president of Georgetown's Young Democrats doing working for a Republican? \nALEC Moving up, Kirbo.

Must have cost some subtle bucks. \nJULES Why do you think God invented credit for fabulous people like me? Fix us a drink. She disappears into the bedroom. \nJULES (0.5.) I knew you'd like it. You have such sensitivity... Fix me a vodka rocks... \n(CONTINUED) \nST. ELMO'S FIRE - Rev. 10/1/84 24. \n29 CONTINUED: 29 V There's no one home. Sadly she walks back to her apart- ment.

Kirbo keeps out of sight, and frantically dashes toward a side entrance to the building. \n31 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSK 31 \nKirbo dashes down the hall. Approaching a corner,-he immediately achieves nonchalance as he \"accidentally\" runs into Dale at the entrance. \nKIRBO Why, Dale? How nice to see you again. \nDALE Kirby, what brings you back here? Nothing serious, I hope. \nKIRBO Oh, no... just tying up some legal loose ends for my friends... \nDALE Excuse me... I'm late... \nKI RBO Ah, funny running into you again.

I'm sure it's the right time. \nALEC Looking at my big picture agenda, I want to be playing softball with my firstborn in about four years. \nLESLIE Do you realize that over half the marriages today end in divorce. \nALEC And the other half don't. \nLESLIE My six-year-old niece asked me today why everyone's father doesn't live in a separate house like her father does. I don't want us to become another divorce statistic in Newsweek. \nALEC Look at my parents. My father may not come home with a raging hard- on, anymore, but they're happy. \n(CONTINUED) \nST.

Should I go for the formal'tux, or the velvet smoking jacket, I-do- this -all -the -time look? \nKEVIN You've left school, put yourself into debt, lied to Alec who got you this job in the first place -- and all for a woman who doesn't seem to be interested in you. \nKIRBO When she sees me in this setting and realizes my potential, which she has always secretly known about me, the veil will be stripped from her eyes and she will give herself to me tonight. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nST.

Other guests arrive, including some regulars from St. Elmo's, undergrads and old schoolmates. Billy enters and seeing some old frat brothers goes nuts. Wendy watches him painfully. \nKEVIN holds court for the undergrads. \nKEVIN The best advice I can give you undergrads is to fail. Failure is a virtue in today's society. Human error is a badge of honor. If you're the alcoholic child of a celebrity, you can blame them and earn a year on the best-seller list. If you're a celebrity, your mistake will earn you a People magazine cover. It's post- Watergate morality. Take responsibility for your mistakes and make a quick buck while you're at it. \nALEC Then Sully snuck the pizza waitress into the showers...

Wendy and Leslie are worried. \nLESLIE How's your stepmother? \nJULES Hanging on. the old witch. At least it gives me a chance to funeral-shop. Did I tell you I found this place in California -- 'The Neptune Society.' They'll wrap her up and throw her to the sharks for five hundred dollars... But I have to ship the body all the way out there... Excuse me. Wendy and Leslie look to each other. Kirbo nervously dials the 'phone. \n(CONTINUED) \n107 CONTINUED: (2) 107 \nKIRBO \nAh... by any chance did Dale Biberman get called in on emergency duty tonight?... Ho? He hangs up and tries her home number. It's busy. \n108 EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - NIGHT 108 \nWendy steps out to get some air. Billy is fooling around inside the house, when he notices her through the window. Their eyes meet, Wendy quickly looks away and moves down the back steps. In a few seconds Billy comes out onto the back porch. \nBILLY So how you doin'? Still living at home? \nWENDY Yeah, how about you? \nBILLY Felicia hasn't kicked me out yet. \nWENDY You been playin' your sax? \nBILLY I hocked it to pay the phone bill... You forgiven me yet for bein' such a horse's ass? \nWENDY There's nothing to forgive. In fact, I should thank you... It helped me grow up a lot and see how stupid I was... \nBILLY How stupid you were to be caring about a loser like me. I agree with you wholeheartedly.

Dale has joined them. \nDALE By driving up here, you've made us responsible for you. Now come inside. \n129 INT.

KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NEAR DAWN 130 \nThe room is destroyed as Leslie and Kevin lie on the floor blissfully in each other's arms. They hear the front DOOR OPEN. \nKEVIN Kirbo? \nALEC (O.S.)

I've been thinking all night about school... How sex was always a barometer,'especially, at the fraternity. The more women you got, the more of a man you were... or thought you were... I thought I was. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n133 CONTINUED: 133 \n9 ALEC (CONT'D) Shit, my whole life at school revolved around sex... even after I fell in love with Leslie. I always had to be doing better than the next guy... I had my rep. Big Al... It all started as a game... Kevin gingerly comes from the bedroom in a robe. \nKEVIN Ah...

But I'm warning you, I will use every bone in my body, every lamp in this room to make sure I inflict as much damage as possible on you before you bring me down. Kevin prepares for the fight. \nALEC You're both pathetic. I don't want to see either one of you again, ever. You understand me? You see me on the street, you see me at St. Elmo's, just pretend you don't know me. On his exit, Alec takes a lamp and throws it against a Woody Allen photograph on the wall.

Dale sits down next to him. \nDALE The reason I didn't know... is because all of this happened \nR between you and you. I could never participate because I never knew what was expected of me. Love isn't like this, Kirby. It's mutual and reciprocal. Guy yells to them from outside. \nGUY (O.S.) Okay, she's starting... You better get out of here before it starts snowing again. \n139 EXT.

She kisses him gently on the cheek. He is about to sink into more pain when suddenly he grabs Dale and kisses her with all the passion he has for her. When he releases her she is dazed. Something has definitely happened. \nGUY Smile. They turn to face Guy and his Polaroid camera. After he takes their photo, he hands it to Kirbo who hands it to Dale'and quickly gets into the car. \n", "test3_id": 2561}

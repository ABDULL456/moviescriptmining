ALEC NEWBERRY, a handsome possessor of The Right Stuff, his beautiful roommate LESLIE HUNTER, KEVIN DOLENZ, self-styled, chain- smoking, sardonic, and KIRBO KREAGER, short, hyper, dressed like a waiter -- dash worriedly into the busy emergency room. They are all twenty-two, or barely twenty-two. Only four months out of college, they are in their freshman year of life. Alec, Leslie, Kevin and Kirbo dash past a cubicle, where a totally naked, three-hundred-pound man paces in a daze. Past this, they find a black nurse talking with two COPS. \nALEC Wendy Beamish and Billy Hicks? They were in a car accident? \nELECTRIC DOORS zip open again, introducing JULIANNA VAN PATTER (JULES), another freshman in life, but her sleek style gives her a certain sexual sophistication. She is accompanied by her dark, interesting DATE as she joins her friends and the Cops. \nJULES They're dead, aren't they? Everyone ignores her as Alec hands his card to the Cops. \nALEC Officers, I'm Alec Newberry with Congressman Langston's office. Leslie whispers to Jules, while Alec and the Cops talk. \nLESLIE I think they're okay. \nJULES Thank God. \n(BEAT) Are you aware there's a three- hundred-pound man walking around naked? \n(CONTINUED) \n1 CONTINUED: 1 WENDY BEAMISH, a sweet-faced, insecure preppy, emerges from a first-aid room with a bandaged forehead. \nHER FRIENDS Wendy. Oh, my God. Are you all right??? \nWENDY I'm fine. It's the car my father gave me for graduation that's totalled. \nALEC \n(TO KEVIN) Find Billy. See if you can sober him up. Kevin always does what Alec tells him to. Meanwhile, Wendy pulls out her Visa card and speaks to the nurse. \nWENDY How much do I owe you? \nJULES He almost killed you. Destroyed your car, and you're paying...? \nLESLIE Jules, please. As Leslie comforts her, Wendy is looking over Jules' Date who hovers in the distance. \nWENDY Is that your date? The naked man wanders past them. \nJULES No, that's my date! As usual, Jules has managed to make Wendy laugh, Just as the Cops approach her. \nCOP # 1 You pressing charges? \nWENDY No. \nKI RBO 'I'm Mr. Hicks' legal counsel and he's not required to take any tests. \n(CONTINUED) \n1 CONTINUED: (2) 0 \nCOP 1 You're a little late, Counselor.

MEDICAL CENTER 2 \nAlec and Kirbo follow the Cops toward a mobile van. \nKIRBO We're dealing with a first offender here, and since Ms. Beamish doesn't want to press charges, whaddya say we just let this one slide, Officers? They reach the back of the mobile van, where we see BILLY HICKS, a handsome daredevil, playing his saxophone, wearing handcuffs, for two good-looking nurses and Kevin, who is trying to give him black coffee. \n", "test1_true": "(CONTINUED) \n2 CONTINUED: 2 \nKEVIN I wouldn't strike a match near his blood. \nBILLY \n(TO COPS) Hey, watch my sax... \n(TO NURSES) . You girls believe in premarital sax? They laugh as Alec barks at him. \nALEC Billy -- four months after graduation and you're still acting like every night's a fraternity party. Aren't you even concerned about Wendy? \nBILLY \n(TRUE PANIC) Wendy? Jesus, how bad is it? \nKEVIN Severe. She might have finally exceeded the limit on her father's Visa. Billy smiles with relief as the Cops lead him toward their car. \nALEC Will you both get serious. He's being arrested for drunk driving. \nBILLY Drunk maybe. But I don't know if you could call that driving. Wendy, Leslie and Jules come from the hospital, just in time to see Billy being put into the cop car. Wendy rushes to Billy and they embrace. \nBILLY Sorry, babe... sorry. \nWEHDY We'll be right behind you! They all move toward Alec's car except Kirbo, who sud- denly notices'someone.

I'm finishing my clinical. \nKIRBO Dale Biberman. I can't believe it. Do you still like Woody Allen movies? There is a big COMMOTION at the other and of the hail. \nDALE I've got to go. Nice seeing you. She races down the hall, joining paramedics wheeling in a large black man on a gurney. His hysterical wife runs screaming behind them. \n(CONTINUED) \nST. ELMO'S FIRE - Rev. 10/1/84 6. \n3 CONTINUED: 3 Dale helps them maneuver the gurney down the hall, leaving a small black child, alone and frightened, in their wake. Dale comes running back and picks up the child. Kirbo watches, as the rest of the hospital moves in real time, but Dale, comforting the frightened child, moves in \nROMANTIC SLOW MOTION.

Laundry folded, they head out of the laundromat passing the drop-off \"Fluff and Fold\" facilities. \nKIRBO 'Fluff and Fold.'

I'm sure it's the right time. \nALEC Looking at my big picture agenda, I want to be playing softball with my firstborn in about four years. \nLESLIE Do you realize that over half the marriages today end in divorce. \nALEC And the other half don't. \nLESLIE My six-year-old niece asked me today why everyone's father doesn't live in a separate house like her father does. I don't want us to become another divorce statistic in Newsweek. \nALEC Look at my parents. My father may not come home with a raging hard- on, anymore, but they're happy. \n(CONTINUED) \nST.

ALEC'S LOFT - HALLWAY - RIGHT 104 \nLeslie locks the door as Alec sets the spray can down and they disappear down the Victorian stairwell. \nALEC Okay. Okay. Like my mom always says, 'Don't get a hard-on'... \nLESLIE And like my mom always says... 'Marriage makes two people one. But you never know which one.' \nALEC Yeah, and like my pop says, 'The way to woman's heart is,to saw her in half.' \nST. ELMO'S FIRE - Rev. 1.0/1/84 71. \n105 EXT.

Should I go for the formal'tux, or the velvet smoking jacket, I-do- this -all -the -time look? \nKEVIN You've left school, put yourself into debt, lied to Alec who got you this job in the first place -- and all for a woman who doesn't seem to be interested in you. \nKIRBO When she sees me in this setting and realizes my potential, which she has always secretly known about me, the veil will be stripped from her eyes and she will give herself to me tonight. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nST.

Other guests arrive, including some regulars from St. Elmo's, undergrads and old schoolmates. Billy enters and seeing some old frat brothers goes nuts. Wendy watches him painfully. \nKEVIN holds court for the undergrads. \nKEVIN The best advice I can give you undergrads is to fail. Failure is a virtue in today's society. Human error is a badge of honor. If you're the alcoholic child of a celebrity, you can blame them and earn a year on the best-seller list. If you're a celebrity, your mistake will earn you a People magazine cover. It's post- Watergate morality. Take responsibility for your mistakes and make a quick buck while you're at it. \nALEC Then Sully snuck the pizza waitress into the showers... They start screaming with laughter. \n(CONTINUED) \n107, CONTINUED: 107 \nBILLY \nAnd the fat chick Sandy met on a plane. Alec and me pretended to be renting agents.

Such a young god... I'll bet you were sproutin' pubic hairs at the age of three. Jules redoes Wendy's makeup as Leslie watches. \nWENDY Jules, your hands are shaking. \nJULES Thin blood. \nLESLIE How's Forrester? She drops the makeup. \nJULES Oh, shit. Wendy and Leslie are worried. \nLESLIE How's your stepmother? \nJULES Hanging on. the old witch. At least it gives me a chance to funeral-shop. Did I tell you I found this place in California -- 'The Neptune Society.' They'll wrap her up and throw her to the sharks for five hundred dollars... But I have to ship the body all the way out there... Excuse me. Wendy and Leslie look to each other. Kirbo nervously dials the 'phone. \n(CONTINUED) \n107 CONTINUED: (2) 107 \nKIRBO \nAh... by any chance did Dale Biberman get called in on emergency duty tonight?... Ho? He hangs up and tries her home number. It's busy. \n108 EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - NIGHT 108 \nWendy steps out to get some air. Billy is fooling around inside the house, when he notices her through the window. Their eyes meet, Wendy quickly looks away and moves down the back steps. In a few seconds Billy comes out onto the back porch. \nBILLY So how you doin'? Still living at home? \nWENDY Yeah, how about you? \nBILLY Felicia hasn't kicked me out yet. \nWENDY You been playin' your sax? \nBILLY I hocked it to pay the phone bill... You forgiven me yet for bein' such a horse's ass? \nWENDY There's nothing to forgive. In fact, I should thank you... It helped me grow up a lot and see how stupid I was... \nBILLY How stupid you were to be caring about a loser like me. I agree with you wholeheartedly. They both pause for a beat. \nWENDY You have a lot of talent, Billy. \nBILLY So you still a virgin? \n(CONTINUED) \nST.

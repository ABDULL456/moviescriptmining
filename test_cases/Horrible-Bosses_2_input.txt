NICK There's gotta be other dental hygienist jobs out there. 
DALE I can't apply for another job, remember? 
KURT Oh, right. Because you'd have to tell them you're a child molester. 
(CONTINUED) 26 CONTINUED: (2) 26 
NICK He's not a child molester. He just took his dick out in a playground. 
DALE It was nighttime and I was peeing! And it's bullshit that I got put on the registered sex offender list for that! 
KURT It worked out. Julia probably hired you because she's a sexual deviant herself. 
DALE Why would they put a playground next to a bar anyway? That's entrapment. 
A SEMI-CUTE GIRL walks past. 
KURT (WITH JOYLESS RESIGNATION) Well, I should go see if that girl wants to bone. 
Kurt groans as he pulls himself out of the booth. 
NICK I thought you were all broken up about your boss dying. 
KURT This is how I grieve, okay? 
Kurt heads off after the girl. 
DALE Man. He must be grieving all the time. 
27 INT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY 27 
Nick sits alongside five other CO-WORKERS at a conference table. Harken's chair at the head is empty. Nick pours himself some water from a glass pitcher on the table. 
NICK He did say ten o'clock, right? 
(CONTINUED) 27 CONTINUED: 27 
CO-WORKER Yeah. Do you know what this is about? 
NICK It just said `staff meeting' on the memo. (WHISPERING) Funny how he gets all over me if I'm a minute late, but he makes us wait fifteen. 
HARKEN (O.S.) You were two minutes late, Nick. 
Nick jumps as Harken enters. 
HARKEN And I didn't know I had to punch a clock with you. 
NICK You don't. Of course you don't. I'm sorry -- 
HARKEN I'm going to attribute this to your drinking problem. 
NICK I don't have a -- 
HARKEN (with a smile to the OTHERS) Let's get started. Shall we? 
Nick's eyes narrow. Suddenly, he grabs the heavy glass pitcher from the table and SHATTERS IT AGAINST HARKEN'S FACE. Shards of glass fly everywhere as Harken falls from his chair onto the floor. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
28 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 28 
Harken is fine. Nick is as we left him. 
HARKEN Okay, have we figured out our best sales distribution plan for the new model year handsets? 
(CONTINUED) 28 CONTINUED: 28 
Nick's CO-WORKERS bury their heads in their notes. Nick tensely raises his hand. 
HARKEN Yes? 
NICK I simulated a number of sales cycles, factoring in likely end- users, point-of-sale limitations and specific demographic variables. 
HARKEN And? 
NICK And in my opinion, an open plan selling process in our top 30 markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield. 
Harken nods. Is he impressed? 
HARKEN Thank you, Nick. Did everyone see how he did that? Yes, he may be a pathological liar and have a crippling drinking problem, but when the chips are down, Nick has what it takes. 
Nick glows. 
HARKEN Which brings us to our next order of business. I've decided who I want as our new Senior VP of Sales. He's sitting right here among you.

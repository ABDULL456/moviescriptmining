THREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How might I serve you? PADME : He's perfect. ANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a Podracer! 
PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and whistles. 
THREEPIO : I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked? 
ARTOO BEEPS 
THREEPIO : (Cont'd) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How embarrassing! 
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS 
AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO BIBBLE hologram. 
BIBBLE : ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me... 
AMIDALA looks upset...almost nervous. 
OBI-WAN : It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind. 
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY 
QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit. 
OBI-WAN : ...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent. QUI-GON : It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace. OBI-WAN : What if it is true and the people are dying? QUI-GON : Either way, we're running out of time. 
EXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT 
DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city. 
DARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master. DARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty. DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge. DARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command. 
The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the city. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY 
The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house. 
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY 
QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift table, having dinner as the wind howls outside. JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a little brighter red. 
SHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere. ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no luck. SHMI : Any attempt to escape... ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof! 
PADME and JAR JAR are horrified. 
JAR JAR : How wude. PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's anti-slavery laws... SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own. 
An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment. 
ANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace? 
PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue. QUI-GON gives him a dirty look. 
QUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous. ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it. 
SHMI looks askance at her son. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's never heard of a human doing it. QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.

68B     POV MOVING TOWARD nurse's station.  We hear Silberman's voice, reviewing medication with the night attendant. 
ON SILBERMAN, yawning, looking at his watch. He turns to go... Sarah is there. She slams into him, hurling him through the door into the cage and follows him in.  The orderly jumps up, going for his stunner, but she nails him with Douglas' baton.  WHAP-WHAP-WHAP!  You can barely see the thing she's swinging it so fast.  The guys goes down. 
Silberman lunges for the alarm button and she cracks down hard on his arm.  He cries out and grabs his wrist. She grabs him by the hair and slams him face down on the desk, smacking him behind the knees expertly with the baton. His legs buckle and he drops to his knees with his chin on the desk. She pins him with one hand.  He face is full of outraged disbelief. 
SILBERMAN You broke my arm! 
SARAH There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move! 
68B     Moving rapidly, she whips open a medication drawer and grabs a syringe. They keep a few of these handy for tranking unruly patients.  She jams it into the orderly's butt and fires the whole shot.  Still holding the empty syringe, she sees what she need next. They keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the inmates from drinking Drano.  She grabs a plastic jug of LIQUID PLUM'R and slams it down on the desk inches from Silberman's eyes. 
She jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug. Draws back the plunger.  The syringe fills with blue liquid. She whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into Silberman's neck. His horrified eyes rack toward it.  10 cc's of blue death fill the cylinder. Her thumb hovers over the plunger. She jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip on him, then hauls him through the door. 
69      IN THE CORRIDOR outside cell #19 the T-1000 stops and looks in the window.  Douglas, his face a bloody mess, yells to be heard. 
DOUGLAS Open the door!  The goddamn bitch is loose in the halls! 
To Douglas' amazement, Lewis the Guard turns impassively and walks away, leaving him shouting soundlessly at the window. 
CUT TO: 
70      EXT. HOSPITAL 
Terminator and John are approaching the guard gate on the Harley. They can see the guard inside looks up at the sound of the engine. 
JOHN Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right? 
TERMINATOR Right. 
John looks at him.  He's not convinced. 
JOHN Swear. 
TERMINATOR What? 
JOHN Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone." 
John holds his hand up, like he's being sworn in.  Terminator stares at John a beat.  Then mimics the gesture. 
TERMINATOR I swear I will not kill anyone. 
Terminator stops the bike and gets off. The guard, sensing trouble, has his gun drawn as he comes out of the shack.  Terminator walks toward him drawing his .45 smoothly.  BLAM! He shoots the guard accurately in the thigh. The guy drops, screaming and clutching his leg. Terminator kicks the guard's gun away, then smashes the phone in the shack with his fist.  He pushes the button to raise the gate and walks back to the bike. 
TERMINATOR He'll live. 
Terminator climbs onto the bike.  They drive toward the hospital, heading down an ambulance ramp to an underground receiving area. 
71      INT. ISOLATION FLOOR 
The attendants at the security checkpoint look up at the monitor as someone enters the corridor.  They see Sarah, holding Silberman at syringe-point. Sarah speaks to them through an intercom on the wall.  Her voice comes through the speaker. 
SARAH Open it or he'll be dead before he hits the floor. 
The attendants' adrenaline levels just went off the scale.  The first attendant shakes him head no.  The amperage here is really high.  The second attendant keys the intercom switch. 
2ND ATTENDANT There's no way, Connor.  Let him go. 
Silberman's face is the color of suet. 
SILBERMAN It won't work, Sarah.  You're no killer.  I don't believe you'd do it. 
Her voice is a deadly cold hiss. 
SARAH You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me! 
SILBERMAN Open the goddamn door! 
The attendants looks at one another.  One of them hits the solenoid button.  The far door unlocks. 
71A     IN THE LOCKOUT CORRIDOR.  Sarah pushes Silberman ahead of her. The nearer, barred door must be unlocked manually. One of the attendants cautiously approaches.  Nervously unlocks it. 
SARAH Step back! 
He does.  She faces both of them.

Dressed now, Joe double-checks his french book for a phrase and heads out. 
EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY 
Joe's truck zooms away from the city, into corn fields. 
EXT. CORN FIELD 
Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears before Joe. Shoots the man in the chest, without hesitation. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
Joe sits at a booth, the waitress Beatrix brings his coffee. 
BEATRIX Bon jour Joe. 
JOE Ravi de te voir, Beatrix. 
BEATRIX Ooh la la. 
INT. PAWN SHOP BACK ROOM - DAY 
JEDD, 70s and knarled, sits in a tiny closet of a work room. Following a BUZZ, Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in the hall. 
JOE (OVER SPEAKER) Two, Jedd. Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then hands him out a small stack of cash. Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number â2'. All the other transactions have the number â4'. 
INT. JOE'S APARTMENT 
Joe smooths out the oriental rug. 
INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT 
Joe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating at another table. 
DALE What's that, fourth loop closed this month? Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his eyebrows at passing ladies. 
JOE Fourth. On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage. 
INT. BACKSTAGE 
Suzie weaves towards her dressing room. Joe catches her. 
SUZIE Hey. 
JOE You working a shift tonight? 
SUZIE Yeah. 
(REALIZES) Yeah, but one of the gat men bought me out already. For the night. 
JOE Oh. 
SUZIE Sweetie. I gotta work. She leaves him watching her go. He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen this whole exchange. The Kid smirks. 
INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB 
Joe bursts back into the club with a vengeance. 
INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER 
Joe staggers in. Not doing so hot. 
INT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Looks at himself in the mirror. Eyes red as candy. He pops open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out an eye dropper and puts one in each. 
INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

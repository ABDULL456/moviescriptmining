FEMALE ASSISTANT Twenty-one, Mr. Levi. Levi's face clouds slightly. The audience does not hear the following exchange. 
LEVI 
(SOTTO VOCE) Twenty-one? I thought we had an even two dozen. 
MALE ASSISTANT The first three we opened were... unhealthy. 
LEVI Really? Any chance that some of the others...? 
FEMALE ASSISTANT We think we're clean. 
LEVI 
J 
(RESTRAINED FURY) God-damn better be. Levi turns back to his audience, radiant once more. 
LEVI We have twenty-one prototype MetaFlesh Game-Pods, and that means that for our first wave test enclave we need twenty-one volunteers who will port in these slave units with the Game-Pod Goddess herself... Levi doesn't need to finish his pitch. Every hand is waving in the air, and every pair of lips is saying, "Me, me, oh God, please, let it be me!" Geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity of the small crowd's enthusiasm. 
INT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 
A SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais and are fitted with their game gear: The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table. Inside, resting in a lining of dense foam, are what look almost like living kidneys: the MetaFlesh Game-Pods. Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped, multi-player UmbyCord that comes with each pod, a split twelve-foot connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord, twisted, translucent, blue and red veiny vessels running just below the surface. The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to receive communion. The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases. The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the back of the game-pods. The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal jacks positioned just above the belt line. Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering, rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous system, on his lap. 
The last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master game- pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the players on either side of her. We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul, standing with arms folded near the church's side door, watching the proceedings with fascination. A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from the action on the dais. He walks over to the door and opens it. A hyper, exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church. Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his way. 
PIKUL Hold it. Not so fast. In response, the fan thrusts a card at him. Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card which includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats his name, Joel Dichter. Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul into the depths of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl case slung over his shoulder. 
DICHTER Oh, god. I hope I'm not too late. Did I miss the port-in? 
PIKUL It's just the first wave. You can be part of the second wave. (rereads the invitation) OK, Joel Dichter. Put your arms up. I have to scan you. Metal and heavy synthetics can't come in. 
DICHTER 
(INCREDULOUS) A weapons check? 
PIKUL More for recording devices. Lotta money invested in these games. Industrial espionage happens. What's in this case? 
DICHTER I brought my game-pod. It's got original Marway tissue architecture. It's kind of obsolete but I was hoping,... 
(MORE) 
DICHTER (CONT'D) even though I couldn't afford the Antenna Fifteen upgrade, I figured out a method of virtual porting that I thought might... Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case, then opens the zipper and feels around. In the case is a more solid, rubbery version of the new MetaFlesh pods. 
PIKUL You won't need it tonight. Everything's provided for. Dichter suddenly spots Geller on the dais. He almost faints. 
DICHTER Migod! Is that who I think it is? 
.PIKUL (with paternal pride) Yeah, that's her. She's something, isn't she?

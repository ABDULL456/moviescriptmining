{"train": "AMADEUS \n\"AMADEUS\" \nby \nPeter Shaffer \nFinal Draft \nINT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT - 1823 \nTotal darkness. We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in distress. It is OLD SALIERI. He uses a mixture of English and occasionally Italian. \nOLD SALIERI Mozart! Mozart! Mozart. Forgive me! Forgive your assassin! Mozart! \nA faint light illuminates the screen. Flickeringly, we see an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs. We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing. Up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET. By his side is Salieri's COOK, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian. It is very cold. They wear shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet. They wheeze as they climb. The candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, which is evidently an old one and in bad decay. A cat scuttles swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon door. \nThe Valet tries the handle. It is locked. Behind it the voice goes on, rising in volume. \nOLD SALIERI Show some mercy! I beg you. I beg you! Show mercy to a guilty man! \nThe Valet knocks gently on the door. The voice stops. \nVALET Open the door, Signore! Please! Be good now! We've brought you something special. Something you're going to love. \nSilence. \nVALET Signore Salieri! Open the door. Come now. Be good! \nThe voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now, and louder. We hear a noise as if a window is being opened. \nOLD SALIERI Mozart! Mozart! I confess it! Listen! I confess! \nThe two servants look at each other in alarm. Then the Valet hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the stairs. \nEXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT \nThe street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing couples and a sled and three dogs. It is a windy night. Snow is falling and whirling about. People are passing on foot, holding their cloaks tightly around them. Some of them are revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties. Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house. The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing gown. \nOLD SALIERI Mozart! Mozart! I cannot bear it any longer! I confess! I confess what I did! I'm guilty! I killed you! Sir I confess! I killed you! \nThe door of the house bursts open. The Valet hobbles out, holding the sugared cake. The wind catches at his shawl. \nOLD SALIERI Mozart, perdonami! Forgive your assassin! Piet\u0088! Piet\u0088! Forgive your assassin! Forgive me! Forgive! Forgive! \nVALET (looking up to the window) That's all right, Signore! He heard you! He forgave you! He wants you to go inside now and shut the window! \nOld Salieri stares down at him. Some of the passersby have now stopped and are watching this spectacle. \nVALET Come on, Signore! Look what I have for you! I can't give it to you from down here, can I? \nOld Salieri looks at him in contempt. Then he turns away back into the room, shutting the window with a bang. Through the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers in the street. They stare back at him in confusion. \nBYSTANDER Who is that? \nVALET No one, sir. He'll be all right. Poor man. He's a little unhappy, you know. \nHe makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the house. The onlookers keep staring. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LANDING OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT \nThe Cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand, the dish of cakes in the other. The Valet arrives, panting. \nVALET Did he open? \nThe Cook, scared, shakes his head: no. The Valet again knocks on the door. \nVALET Here I am, Signore. Now open the door. \nHe eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily. \nVALET Mmmm - this is good! This is the most delicious thing I ever ate, believe me! Signore, you don't know what you're missing! Mmmm! \nWe hear a thump from inside the bedroom. \nVALET Now that's enough, Signore! Open! \nWe hear a terrible, throaty groaning. \nVALET If you don't open this door, we're going to eat everything. There'll be nothing left for you. And I'm not going to bring you anything more. \nHe looks down. From under the door we see a trickle of blood flowing. In horror, the two men stare at it. The dish of cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters. \nHe sets the candlestick down on the floor. Both servants run at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the frail lock gives. The door flies open. \nImmediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony No. 25 (the Little G Minor) begins. We see what the servants see. \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT \nOld Salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive. He gestures at them. They run to him. Barely, we glimpse the room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte- piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin. \nINT. BALLROOM - NIGHT \nTwenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, full orchestra. \nAs the music slows a little, we see a Masquerade Ball in progress. A crowded room of dancers is executing the slow portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAs the fast music returns, we see Old Salieri being carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle- aged doctor in a tall hat. This is DOCTOR GULDEN. He gets in beside his patient. The driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow. \nMONTAGE: \nEXT. FOUR STREETS OF VIENNA AND \nINT. THE WAGON - NIGHT \nThe wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city. Inside the conveyance we see Old Salieri wrapped in blankets, half-conscious, being held by the hospital attendants. Doctor Gulden stares at him grimly. The wagon arrives outside the General Hospital of Vienna. \nVOGLER For God's sake, my son, if you have anything to confess, do it now! Give yourself some peace! \nA further pause. \nVOGLER Do you hear me? \nOLD SALIERI He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered. \nPause. \nVOGLER (almost whispering) Yes? Did you do it? \nSuddenly Old Salieri turns to him, a look of extreme innocence. \nOLD SALIERI He was my idol! I can't remember a time when I didn't know his name! When I was only fourteen he was already famous. Even in Legnago - the tiniest town in Italy - I knew of him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A SMALL TOWN SQUARE IN LOMBARDY, ITALY - DAY - 1780'S \nThere are twelve children and twenty adults in the square. We see the fourteen-year-old Salieri blindfolded, playing a game of Blindman's Bluff with other Italian children, running about in the bright sunshine and laughing. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) I was still playing childish games when he was playing music for kings and emperors. Even the Pope in Rome! \nCUT TO: \nINT. A SALON IN THE VATICAN - DAY - 1780'S \nWe see the six-year-old MOZART, also blindfolded, seated in a gilded chair on a pile of books, playing the harpsichord for the POPE and a suite of CARDINALS and other churchmen. Beside the little boy stands LEOPOLD, his father, smirking with pride. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) I admit I was jealous when I heard the tales they told about him. Not of the brilliant little prodigy himself, but of his father, who had taught him everything. \nThe piece finishes. Leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord and lifts up his little son to stand on it. Mozart removes the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes. Both father and son bow. A Papal Chamberlain presents Leopold with a gold snuff box whilst the cardinals decorously applaud. Over this scene Old Salieri speaks. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) My father did not care for music. He wanted me only to be a merchant, like himself. As anonymous as he was. When I told how I wished I could be like Mozart, he would say, Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey? Would you like me to drag you around Europe doing tricks like a circus freak? How could I tell him what music meant to me? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A COUNTRY CHURCH IN NORTH ITALY - DAY - 1780'S \nSerene music of the Italian Baroque - Pergolesi's Stabat Mater - sung by a choir of boys with organ accompaniment. We see the outside of the 17th-century church sitting in the wide landscape of Lombardy: sunlit fields, a dusty, white road, poplar trees. \nINT. THE CHURCH AT LEGNAGO - DAY - 1780'S \nThe music continues and swells. We see the twelve-year-old Salieri seated between his plump and placid parents in the congregation, listening in rapture. His father is a heavy- looking, self-approving man, obviously indifferent to the music. A large and austere Christ on the cross hangs over the altar. Candles burn below his image. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) Even then a spray of sounded notes could make me dizzy, almost to falling. \nThe boy falls forward on his knees. So do his parents and the other members of the congregation. He stares up at Christ who stares back at him. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) Whilst my father prayed earnestly to God to protect commerce, I would offer up secretly the proudest prayer a boy could think of. Lord, make me a great composer! Let me celebrate your glory through music - and be celebrated myself! Make me famous through the world, dear God! Make me immortal! After I die let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote! In return I vow I will give you my chastity - my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life. And I will help my fellow man all I can. Amen and amen! \nThe music swells to a crescendo. The candles flare. We see the Christ through the flames looking at the boy benignly. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) And do you know what happened? A miracle! \nINT. DINING ROOM IN THE SALIERI HOUSE - DAY - 1780'S \nCU, a large cooked fish on a thick china plate. Camera pulls back to show the Salieri family at dinner. Father Salieri sits at the head of the table, a napkin tucked into his chin. Mother Salieri is serving the fish into portions and handing them round. Two maiden aunts are in attendance, wearing black, and of course the young boy. Father Salieri receives his plate of fish and starts to eat greedily. Suddenly there is a gasp - he starts to choke violently on a fish bone. All the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling him, but it is in vain. Father Salieri collapses. \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - 1823 \nOLD SALIERI Suddenly he was dead. Just like that! And my life changed forever. My mother said, Go. Study music if you really want to. Off with you! And off I went as quick as I could and never saw Italy again. Of course, I knew God had arranged it all; that was obvious. One moment I was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town. The next I was here, in Vienna, city of musicians, sixteen years old and studying under Gluck! Gluck, Father. Do you know who he was? The greatest composer of his time. And he loved me! That was the wonder. He taught me everything he knew. And when I was ready, introduced me personally to the Emperor! Emperor Joseph - the musical king!  Within a few years I was his court composer. Wasn't that incredible? Imperial Composer to His Majesty! Actually the man had no ear at all, but what did it matter? He adored my music, that was enough. Night after night I sat right next to the Emperor of Austria, playing duets with him, correcting the royal sight-reading. Tell me, if you had been me, wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow? And believe me, I honoured it. I was a model of virtue. I kept my hands off women, worked hours every day teaching students, many of them for free, sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians - work and work and work, that was all my life. And it was wonderful! Everybody liked me. I liked myself. I was the most successful musician in Vienna. And the happiest. Till he came. Mozart. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE ARCHBISHOP OF SALZBURG'S RESIDENCE - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S \nA grand room crowded with guests. A small group of Gypsy musicians is playing in the background. Thirteen members of the Archbishop's orchestra - all wind players, complete with 18th-century wind instruments: elaborate-looking bassoons, basset horns, etc. and wearing their employer's livery - are laying out music on stands at one end of the room. At the other end is a large gilded chair, bearing the arms of the ARCHBISHOP OF SALZBURG. A throng of people is standing, talking, and preparing to sit upon the rows of waiting chairs to hear a concert. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) One day he came to Vienna to play some of his music at the residence of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Eagerly I went there to seek him out. That night changed my life. \nWe see Salieri, age thirty-one, a neat, carefully turned-cut man in decent black clothes and clean white linen, walking through the crowd of guests. We follow him. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) As I went through the salon, I played a game with myself. This man had written his first concerto at the age of four; his first symphony at seven; a full-scale opera at twelve. Did it show? Is talent like that written on the face? \nWe see shots of assorted young men staring back at Salieri as he moves through the crowd. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) Which one of them could he be? \nSome of the men recognize Salieri and bow respectfully. Then suddenly a servant bearing a large tray of cakes and pastries stalks past. Instantly riveted by the sight of such delights, Salieri follows him out of the Grand Salon. \nINT. A PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S \nThe servant marches along bearing his tray of pastries aloft. Salieri follows him. \nThe servant turns into: \nINT. BUFFET ROOM IN THE PALACE - DAY - 1780'S \nSalieri's POV: several tables, dressed to the floor with cloths are loaded with many plates of confectionery. It is, in fact, Salieri's idea of paradise! The servant puts his tray down on one of the tables and withdraws from the room. \nINT. A PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S \nSalieri turns away so as not to be noticed by the servant. As soon as the man disappears, Salieri sneaks into the buffet room. \nINT. BUFFET ROOM IN THE PALACE - DAY - 1780'S \nSalieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously. He is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of sweet things. His attention is attracted in particular by a huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a pineapple. He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him. He ducks down behind the pastry table. \nA girl - CONSTANZE - rushes into the room. She runs straight across it and hides herself behind one of the tables. \nAfter a beat of total silence, MOZART runs into the room, stops, and looks around. He is age twenty-six, wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the Archbishop of Salzburg upon it. He is puzzled; Constanze has disappeared. \nBaffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny mouse. Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat. Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze. We hear a high-pitched giggle, which is going to characterize Mozart throughout the film. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S \nThe throng is mostly seated. The musicians are in their places, holding their various exotic-looking wind instruments; the candles are all lit. A Majordomo appears and bangs his staff on the floor for attention. Immediately COLLOREDO, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg enters. He is a small self- important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet skullcap. He is followed by his Chamberlain, the Count ARCO. Everyone stands. The Archbishop goes to his throne and sits. His guests sit also. Arco gives the signal to start the music. Nothing happens. Instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches the Chamberlain and whispers in his ear. Arco in turn whispers to the Archbishop. \nINT. PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S \nThe music is louder. Mozart hastens towards the Grand Salon away from the buffet room, adjusting his dress as he goes. \nINT. GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S \nThe opening of the Serenade is being tentatively conducted by the leader of the wind-musicians. Guests turn around as Mozart appears - bowing to the Archbishop - and walks with an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is playing. The leader yields his place to the composer and Mozart smoothly takes over conducting. \nConstanze, deeply embarrassed, sneaks into the room and seats herself at the back. \nINT. PALACE BUFFET ROOM - DAY - 1780'S \nThe music fades down. Salieri stands shocked from his inadvertent eavesdropping. After a second he moves almost in a trance toward the door; the music dissolves. \nINT. GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S \nMozart is conducting the Adagio from his Serenade (K. 361), guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists. The squeezebox opening of the movement begins. Salieri appears at the door at the back of the salon. He stares in disbelief at Mozart. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) So that was he! That giggling, dirty- minded creature I'd just seen crawling on the floor. Mozart. The phenomenon whose legend had haunted my youth. Impossible. \nThe music swells up and Salieri listens to it with eyes closed - amazed, transported - suddenly engulfed by the sound. Finally it fades down and away and changes into applause. Salieri opens his eyes. \nThe audience is clearly delighted. Mozart bows to them, also delighted. Colloredo rises abruptly, and without looking at Mozart or applauding and leaves the Salon. Count Arco approaches the composer. Mozart turns to him, radiant. \nARCO Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word. \nMOZART Certainly! \nHe follows Arco out of the room, through a throng of admirers. \nINT. ANOTHER PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S \nMozart and Arco walk side by side. They pass Salieri who is staring at Mozart in fascination. As they disappear, he steals toward the music stands, unable to help himself. \nMOZART Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you? \nARCO Indeed. \nMOZART These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it. \nARCO His Grace is very angry with you. \nMOZART What do you mean? \nThey arrive at the door of Colloredo's private apartment. \nARCO You are to come in here and ask his pardon. \nArco opens the door. \nINT. ARCHBISHOP'S PRIVATE ROOM - DAY - 1780'S \nThe Archbishop is sitting, chatting to quests. Among them are several ladies. Arco approaches him obsequiously. \nARCO Your Grace. \nCOLLOREDO Ah, Mozart. Why? \nMOZART Why what, sir? \nCOLLOREDO Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants? \nMOZART Humiliated? \nCOLLOREDO How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take. \nThe company watches this scene, deeply interested. \nMOZART If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me. \nCOLLOREDO I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come. \nMOZART No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy. \nCOLLOREDO Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now. \nHe extends his hand to be kissed. Mozart does it with a furious grace, then leaves the room. As he opens the door we see: \nINT. PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S \nA group of people who have attended the concert, among them Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment. At sight of the composer they break into sustained applause. Mozart is suddenly delighted. He throws the door wide open \nso that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits - and he can see them. Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee. He smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small ovation. \nMozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures. Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause. \nINT. PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S \nSalieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the full score of the Serenade. He turns the pages back to the slow movement. Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains. \nCU, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination. The music is played against his description of it. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) Extraordinary! On the page it looked nothing. The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse - bassoons and basset horns - like a rusty squeezebox. Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing a voice of God. \nSuddenly the music snaps off. Mozart stands before him as he lays down the score. \nMOZART Excuse me! \nHe takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room. Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) But why? \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 \nOLD SALIERI Why?  Would God choose an obscene child to be His instrument? It was not to be believed! This piece had to be an accident. It had to be! \nINT. PALACE DINING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S \nAt the table sits the EMPEROR JOSEPH II, eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk. He is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform. Around him but standing, are his Chamberlain, JOHANN VON STRACK: stiff and highly correct. COUNT ORSINI-ROSENBERG: a corpulent man of sixty, highly conscious of his position as Director of the Opera. BARON VON SWIETEN, the Imperial Librarian: a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties. FIRST KAPELLMEISTER GIUSEPPE BONNO: very Italian, cringing and time-serving, aged about seventy. And Salieri, wearing decorous black, as usual. \nAt a side-table, two Imperial secretaries, using quill pens and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is said. \nSALIERI Majesty, I hope you won't think it improper, but I have written a little March of Welcome in his honour. \nHe produces a paper. \nJOSEPH What a charming idea. May I see? \nSALIERI (handing it over) It's just a trifle, of course. \nJOSEPH May I try it? \nSALIERI Majesty. \nThe Emperor goes to the instrument, sits and plays the first bars of it. Quite well. \nJOSEPH Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in? \nSALIERI You do me too much honour, Sire. \nJOSEPH Let's have some fun. (to the waiting Majordomo) Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice. \nThe Majordomo bows and goes. The Emperor addresses himself to the march. He plays a wrong note. \nSALIERI A-flat, Majesty. \nJOSEPH Ah-ha! \nINT. PALACE CORRIDOR - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S \nTaking his instructions literally, the Majordomo is marching very slowly toward the salon door. He is followed by a bewildered Mozart, dressed very stylishly and wearing one of the wigs from the perruqier. \nINT. ROYAL PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S \nJoseph finishes the march. The door opens. \nMAJORDOMO Herr Mozart. \nMozart comes in eagerly. Immediately the march begins, played by His Majesty. All the courtiers stand, listening with admiration. Joseph plays well, but applies himself fiercely to the manuscript. Mozart, still bewildered, regards the scene, but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself. It finishes and all clap obsequiously. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Bravo, Your Majesty! \nVON STRACK Well done, Sire! \nThe Emperor rises, pleased with himself. He snatches the manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the rest of the scene. \nJOSEPH Gentlemen, gentlemen, a little less enthusiasm, I beg you. Ah, Mozart. \nHe extends his hand. Mozart throws himself to his knees, and to Joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour. \nMOZART Your Majesty! \nJOSEPH No, no, please! It is not a holy relic. (raising Mozart up) You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old. (to the others) He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no? \nEmbarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle. Joseph helps him out. \nJOSEPH You know all these gentlemen, I'm sure. \nVon Strack and Bonno nod. \nJOSEPH The Baron Von Swieten. \nVON SWIETEN I'm a great admirer of yours, young man. Welcome. \nMOZART Oh, thank you. \nJOSEPH The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg. \nMOZART (bowing excitedly) Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely. \nOrsini-Rosenberg nods without enthusiasm. \nJOSEPH And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri. \nSALIERI (taking his hand) Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario! \nMOZART I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours? \nSALIERI Really? \nMOZART Mio caro Adone. \nSALIERI Ah! \nMOZART A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things. \nJOSEPH And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you. \nMOZART (speaking expertly) Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo! \nHe bows elaborately. Salieri inclines himself, dryly. \nSALIERI My pleasure. \nJOSEPH Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say? \nMOZART Majesty! \nJOSEPH (to the courtiers) Did we vote in the end for German or Italian? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian. \nVON STRACK Did we? \nVON SWIETEN I don't think it was really decided, Director. \nMOZART Oh, German! German! Please let it be German. \nJOSEPH Why so? \nMOZART Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto! \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Oh? Have I seen it? \nSALIERI Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip. \nCAVALIERI Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart. \nSALIERI Oh? News travels fast in Vienna. \nCAVALIERI And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true? \nSALIERI Yes. \nCAVALIERI Is there a part for me? \nSALIERI No. \nCAVALIERI How do you know? \nSALIERI Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one. \nCAVALIERI Why not? \nSALIERI Well, do you know where it's set, my dear? \nCAVALIERI Where? \nSALIERI In a harem. \nCAVALIERI What's that? \nSALIERI A brothel. \nCAVALIERI Oh! \nSALIERI A Turkish brothel. \nCAVALIERI Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it. \nSALIERI My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk. \nHe seats himself at the forte-piano. \nCAVALIERI Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway. \nSALIERI Perhaps. \nHe plays a chord. She sings a scale, expertly. He strikes another chord. She starts another scale, then breaks off. \nCAVALIERI What does he look like? \nSALIERI You might be disappointed. \nCAVALIERI Why? \nSALIERI Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina. \nCAVALIERI (airily) Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste. \nHe strikes the chord again, firmly. Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria. \nWe DISSOLVE on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish manner, and we are on: \nINT. OPERA STAGE - VIENNA - 1780'S \nThe heroine of the opera (Cavalieri) is in full cry addressing the Pasha with scorn and defiance. \nThe house is full. Watching the performance - which is conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box. \nIn another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is Constanze. This is the formidable MADAME WEBER and her three daughters, Constanze, JOSEFA and SOPHIE. All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber is especially enraptured by being there at all. Not so, Salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage. \nCavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen. \nCAVALIERI Since you are determined, Since you are determined, Calmly, with no ferment, Welcome - every pain and woe. Bind me then - compel me! Bind me then - compel me! Hurt me. Break me! Kill me! At last I shall be freed by death! \nAfter a few moments of this showy aria, with the composer and the singer staring at each other - he conducting elaborately for her benefit, and she following his beat with rapturous eyes - the music fades, and Salieri speaks over it. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) There she was. I had no idea where they met - or how - yet there she stood on stage for all to see. Showing off like the greedy songbird she was. Ten minutes of ghastly scales and arpeggios, whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground. \nMusic up again for the last 30 bars of the aria. \nCAVALIERI (singing) Be freed at last by death! Be freed at last by death! At last I shall be freed By! Death! \nBefore the orchestral coda ends, cut to: \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 \nThrough the window we see that night has fallen. \nOLD SALIERI Understand, I was in love with the girl. Or at least in lust. I wasn't a saint. It took me the most tremendous effort to be faithful to my vow. I swear to you I never laid a finger on her. All the same, I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her - least of all the Creature. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT.   THE OPERA HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S \nThe brilliant Turkish finale of Seraglio bursts over us. All the cast is lined up on stage. Mozart is conducting with happy excitement. \nCAST OF SERAGLIO (singing) Pasha Selim May he Live forever! Ever, ever, ever, ever! Honour to his regal name! Honour to his regal name! May his noble brow emblazon Glory, fortune, joy and fame! Honour be to Pasha Selim Honour to his regal name! Honour to his regal name! \nThe curtains fall. Much applause. The Emperor claps vigorously and - following his lead - so do the courtiers. The curtains part. Mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back. He skips up onto the stage amongst them. The curtains fall again as they all bow. In the auditorium, the chandeliers descend, filling it with light. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE STAGE -  VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S \nThe curtains are down, and an excited hubbub of singers in costume surround Mozart and Cavalieri, all excited and chattering. Suddenly a hush. The Emperor is seen approaching from the wings, lit by flunkies holding candles. Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg and Von Swieten, amongst others, follow him. Also Salieri. The singers line up. Joseph stops at Cavalieri who makes a deep curtsey. \nJOSEPH Bravo, Madame. You are an ornament to our stage. \nCAVALIERI Majesty. \nJOSEPH (to Salieri) And to you, Court Composer. Your pupil has done you great credit. \nINT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR -  VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S \nMADAME WEBER Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor. \nMOZART Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage. \nCAVALIERI Don't bother! \nMOZART What? \nCAVALIERI Don't bother. \nMOZART I'll be right back. \nHe dashes off. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE STAGE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S \nConstanze and Mozart make their way quickly through a crowd of actors in turbans and caftans, and stagehands carrying bits of the dismantled set of Seraglio. We see all the turmoil of backstage after a performance. \nA fireman passes Mozart carrying a small bucket of water. Mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the crowd to Madame Weber, who still lies prone on the stage. \nMozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws water on her face. She is instantly revived by the shock. Constanze assists her to rise. \nCONSTANZE Are you all right? \nInstead of being furious, Madame Weber smiles at them rapturously. \nMADAME WEBER Ah, what an evening! What a wise man we have for an Emperor. Oh, my children! (with sudden, hard briskness) Now I want you to write your father exactly what His Majesty said. \nThe activity continues to swirl around them. \nMOZART You should really go home now, Frau Weber. Your carriage must be waiting. \nMADAME WEBER But aren't you taking us? \nMOZART I have to talk to the singers. \nMADAME WEBER That's all right; we'll wait for you. Just don't take all night. \nINT. CAVALIERI'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S \nCavalieri, still in costume, is marching up and down, very agitated. \nCAVALIERI Did you know? Had you heard? \nSALIERI What? \nCAVALIERI The marriage! \nSALIERI Well, what does it matter to you? \nCAVALIERI Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn. \nShe catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself. \nCAVALIERI How was I? Tell me honestly. \nSALIERI You were sublime. \nCAVALIERI What did you think of the music? \nSALIERI Extremely clever. \nCAVALIERI Meaning you didn't like it. \nMozart comes in unexpectedly. \nMOZART Oh - excuse me! \nCAVALIERI Is her mother still lying on the floor? \nMOZART No, she's fine. \nCAVALIERI I'm so relieved. \nShe seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig. \nSALIERI Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations. \nMOZART Did you like it, then? \nSALIERI How could I not? \nMOZART It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree? \nCAVALIERI Is she a good fuck? \nMOZART What?? \nCAVALIERI I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that. \nSalieri looks astonished. There is a knock on the door. \nCAVALIERI Come in! \nThe door opens. Constanze enters. \nCONSTANZE Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now? \nMOZART Of course. \nCAVALIERI No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang? \nMOZART Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore. \nMozart hurries Constanze out of the door. Cavalieri looks after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of control. \nCAVALIERI You really are full of surprises, aren't you? You are quite extraordinary, you little shit! \nShe turns and collapses, crying with rage, into Salieri's arms. We focus on him. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) At that moment I knew beyond any doubt. He'd had her. The Creature had had my darling girl. \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1820'S \nSALIERI (bowing) Sire. \nJOSEPH Well. There it is. \nHe rides on. The groom releases her horse's head, and runs on after the Princess. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN VON STRACK'S STUDY - DAY - 1780'S \nVon Strack sits stiffly behind his gilded desk. Mozart stands before him, trembling with anger. \nMOZART What is this, Herr Chamberlain? \nVON STRACK What is what? \nMOZART Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl. \nVON STRACK Because His Majesty wishes it. \nMOZART Is the Emperor angry with me? \nVON STRACK On the contrary. \nMOZART Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post? \nVON STRACK Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna. \nMOZART No, but I'm the best. \nVON STRACK A little modesty would suit you better. \nMOZART Who is on this committee? \nVON STRACK Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri. \nMOZART Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians! \nVON STRACK Mozart - \nMOZART They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection! (singing angrily) Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid. \nVON STRACK Mozart - \nMOZART Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music! \nVON STRACK Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues. \nMOZART Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not! \nCUT TO: \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S \nThe room is very small and untidy. Constanze is marching up and down it, upset. Mozart is lying on the bed. \nCONSTANZE I think you're mad! You're really mad! \nMOZART Oh, leave me alone. \nCONSTANZE One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life! \nMOZART They'll come anyway. They love me here. \nCONSTANZE No, they will not. I know how things work in this city. \nMOZART Oh yes? You always know everything. \nCONSTANZE Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that! \nMOZART You borrowed money from your mother? \nCONSTANZE Yes! \nMOZART Well, don't do that again! \nCONSTANZE How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg? \nMOZART Don't be stupid. \nCONSTANZE All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that? \nMOZART Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them. \nCONSTANZE This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity! \nShe glares at him, almost in tears. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALIERI'S MUSIC ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nSalieri is giving a lesson to a girl student, who is singing the Italian art song, Caro Mio Ben. \nThere is a knock on the door. \nSALIERI Yes. \nA SERVANT enters. \nSERVANT Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you. \nSALIERI Who is she? \nSERVANT She didn't say. But she says it's urgent. \nSALIERI (to the pupil) Excuse me, my dear. \nSalieri goes into the salon. \nCUT TO: \nCONSTANZE Oh, thank you, sir! \nOverjoyed, she stops and kisses his hand. He raises her - and then clasps her to him clumsily. She pushes herself away. \nSALIERI Come back tonight. \nCONSTANZE Tonight? \nSALIERI Alone. \nCONSTANZE What for? \nSALIERI Some service deserves service in return. No? \nCONSTANZE What do you mean? \nSALIERI Isn't it obvious? \nThey stare at one another: Constanze in total disbelief. \nSALIERI It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight. \nCONSTANZE But! I'm a married woman! \nSALIERI Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price. \nHe glares at her. \nSALIERI Yes. \nHe rings a silver bell for a servant and abruptly leaves the roam. Constanze stares after him, horrified. \nThe servant enters. Shocked and stunned, Constanze goes down an her knees and starts picking up the music from the floor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 \nCU, Father Vogler, horrified. \nOLD SALIERI Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God. \nVOGLER (crying out) You cannot say that! \nOLD SALIERI No? Was Mozart a good man? \nVOGLER God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know. \nOLD SALIERI All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him! \nVOGLER My son, no one can speak for God. \nOLD SALIERI Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me! \nVOGLER I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should. \nOLD SALIERI (impatiently) Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers! (intimately to the priest) There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S \nSalieri sits at his desk, staring up at the cross. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) Evening came to that room. I sat there not knowing whether the girl would return or not. I prayed as I'd never prayed before. \nSALIERI Dear God, enter me now. Fill me with one piece of true music. One piece with your breath in it, so I know that you love me. Please. Just one. Show me one sign of your favour, and I will show mine to Mozart and his wife. I will get him the royal position, and if she comes, I'll receive her with all respect and send her home in joy. Enter me! Enter me! Please! Te imploro. \nLong, long silence. Salieri stares at the cross. Christ stares back at him impassively. Finally in this silence we hear a faint knocking at the door. Salieri stirs himself. A servant appears. \nSERVANT That lady is back, sir. \nSALIERI Show her in. Then go to bed. \nThe Servant bows and leaves. We follow him through: \nINT. MUSIC ROOM IN SALIERI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - 1780'S \nThe Servant crosses it and enters: \nINT. SALON IN SALIERI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - 1780'S \nConstanze is sitting on an upright chair, veiled as before, the portfolio of music on her lap. Through the far door leading from the hall, another servant is peering at her. The first servant joins him and shuts the door on the girl, leaving her alone. \nWe stay with her. The clock ticks on the mantelpiece. We hear an old carriage pass in the street below. Nervously she lifts her veil and looks about her. \nSuddenly Salieri appears from the music room. He is pale and very tight. They regard each other. She smiles and rises to greet him, affecting a relaxed and warm manner, as if to put him at his ease. \nCONSTANZE Well, I'm here. My husband has gone to a concert. He didn't think I would enjoy it. \nA pause. \nCONSTANZE I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go? \nSALIERI What? \nCONSTANZE Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous. \nAs she talks, she extinguishes the candles in a pair of Venetian candelabra and subsequently other candles around the room. \nCONSTANZE Wolfgang was given some candlesticks by King George in England, but they were only wood. Oh, excuse me. Let's not talk about him. What do you think of this? It's real lace. Brussels. \nShe turns and takes off her shawl. \nCONSTANZE Well, it's much too good for every day. I keep saying to Wolfi, don't be so extravagant. Presents are lovely, but we can't afford them. It doesn't do any good. The more I tell him, the more he spends. Oh, excuse me! There I go again. \nShe picks up the portfolio. \nCONSTANZE Do you still want to look at this? Or don't we need to bother anymore? I imagine we don't, really. \nShe looks at him inquiringly, and drops the portfolio on the floor; pages of music pour out of it. Instantly we hear a massive chord, and the great Qui Tollis from the Mass in C Minor fills the room. To its grand and weighty sound, Constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri. Between him and her, music is an active presence, hurting and baffling him. He opens his mouth in distress. The music pounds in his head. The candle flickers over her as she removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace. Suddenly he cries out. \nJOSEPH Of course not. \nSALIERI I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies. \nJOSEPH Really? \nSALIERI As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well! \nJOSEPH Yes? \nSALIERI Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson. \nA pause. \nJOSEPH Ah-ha. Well. There it is. \nINT. SALIERI'S HOUSE - STAIRCASE - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S \nSalieri has just returned from the palace and is coming up the staircase. He is met by his servant. \nSERVANT Sir, there is a Herr Mozart waiting for you in the salon. \nSalieri is plainly alarmed. \nSALIERI What does he want? \nSERVANT He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting. \nSALIERI Come with me. And stay in the room. \nHe mounts the stairs. \nINT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - SALON - DAY - 1780'S \nMozart is waiting for Salieri, holding a portfolio. Salieri approaches him nervously. Mozart stands not belligerently, but humbly. \nSALIERI Herr Mozart, what brings you here? \nMOZART Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now. \nSALIERI So you are. How is your pretty wife? \nMOZART She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know. \nSALIERI I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course. \nMOZART So you see, this post is very important to me right now. \nSalieri looks at him in distress. \nSALIERI Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't. \nMOZART Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted? \nSALIERI I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled. \nMOZART Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please! \nSALIERI My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late. \nMOZART Whom did they choose? \nSALIERI Herr Sommer. \nMOZART Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity. \nSALIERI No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity. \nMOZART But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess! \nSALIERI An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth. \nMozart chuckles delightedly. Salieri offers him a glass of white dessert and a spoon. Mozart takes it absently and goes on talking. \nMOZART Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage. \nSALIERI You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty? \nMOZART No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why. \nSALIERI It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means. \nMOZART How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all! \nSALIERI How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful. \nMOZART They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend! \nSALIERI Of course not. \nMOZART Do you have a daughter? \nSALIERI I'm afraid not. \nMOZART Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe! \nSALIERI Ah, how exciting! Tell me more. \nMOZART I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret. \nSALIERI Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly. \nMOZART Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it? \nSALIERI Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone. \nMOZART Ah. Italian? \nSALIERI Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind. \nMOZART Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty? \nFRAU SCHLUMBERG Michael! \nMOZART Perhaps if I were to play a little first, it might encourage the Fraulein. (to the girl) Why don't you let me try the instrument? All right? \nSuddenly the girl rises. Mozart smiles at the parents. They smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands and preludes over the keys. Instantly a dog howls loudly. Startled, Mozart stops. Schlumberg leaps to his feet and goes over to the beagle. \nSCHLUMBERG Stop that, Dudelsachs! Stop it at once! (to Mozart) Don't let him disturb you. He'll be all right. He's just a little willful too. Please, please - play. I beg you. \nMozart resumes playing. This time it is a lively piece, perhaps the Presto Finale from the K. 450. The dog howls immediately. \nSCHLUMBERG Stop it! STOP! \nMozart stops. \nSCHLUMBERG No, not you. I was talking to the dog. You keep playing. It's most important. He always howls when he hears music. We've got to break them of the habit. Play, please. Please! \nAmazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again. The dog howls louder. \nSCHLUMBERG That's it. Now keep going, just keep going. (to the beagle) Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs, you stop it this instant! This instant, do you hear me? Keep going, Herr Mozart, that's it. Go on, go on! \nMozart plays on. Suddenly the dog falls silent. Schlumberg smiles broadly. \nSCHLUMBERG Good, good, good! Very good dog! Very, very good Dudelsachs. (to his wife, snapping his fingers) Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit. \nThe wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits. A servant brings in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray. He puts it down beside Mozart as Schlumberg addresses the silent dog with deepest affection. \nSCHLUMBERG Now guess who's going to get a nice reward? Clever, clever Dudi. \nHe gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily. Mozart stops playing and stands up. \nSCHLUMBERG It's a miracle, Herr Mozart! \nMOZART (barely controlling himself) Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir! \nHe bows to them and leaves the room. They look after him in puzzled astonishment. \nFRAU SCHLUMBERG What a strange young man. \nSCHLUMBERG Yes. He is a little strange. \nEXT. A BUSY STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S \nA cheerful scene. We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers, sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons. Horses and carriage clatter past him. His mood is best expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on the forte-piano. \nStill in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house. \nINT. MOZART'S HOUSE - HALLWAY -  DAY - 1780'S \nSuddenly, he stops. He looks up the stairs. The grim opening chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march from Figaro. What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, standing on the landing. The light comes from behind the figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession. It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held before Mozart realizes who it is. Then, as the music continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's arms. \nMOZART Papa! PAPA! \nBoth men embrace. The music slowly fades. \nINT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S \nA cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages. We see music lying everywhere. Also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food. \nMozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health. \nMOZART Why are you here? \nLEOPOLD Am I not welcome? \nMOZART Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa! \nHe kisses his hands. \nLEOPOLD You're very thin. Does she not feed you, this wife of yours? \nMozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the landing. \nMOZART Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see. \nLEOPOLD Is she not here? \nMOZART I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi! \nLeopold looks about him at the mess in the room. \nLEOPOLD Do you always live like this? \nMOZART Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see. \nHe carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the bedroom. Constanze lies in bed. She sits up, startled. \nMOZART Oh! I didn't know you were home. Stanzi, this is my father. \nConstanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold. Leopold stares back from the doorway. \nMOZART We'll wait, we'll wait. Why don't you get up now, darling? \nHe closes the door again. \nMOZART She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me. \nLEOPOLD Don't you have a maid? \nMOZART Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself. \nLEOPOLD How is your financial situation? \nMOZART It couldn't be better. \nLEOPOLD That's not what I hear. \nMOZART What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here. \nLEOPOLD They say you're in debt. \nMOZART Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie! \nConstanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice. \nCONSTANZE This is just a game, Papa! \nLaughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children. \nBYSTANDERS This is just a game, Papa! \nAs Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody bursts into applause. Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig. Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to dance. Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone. Seeing this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father entreatingly by the arm. \nMOZART Oh no, Papa, please! Don't spoil the fun. Come on. Here, take mine. \nHe takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered head. The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. He takes Constanze's wig from his father. As this happens, the music stops again. Mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the Odd Man Out. He giggles. Schikaneder calls out to Leopold from the keyboard. \nSCHIKANEDER Herr Mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty? \nApplause. \nMOZART Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say! \nLEOPOLD I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son. \nSCHIKANEDER What did he say? What did he say? \nMOZART Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room. \nLEOPOLD I'm tired of this game. Please play without me. \nMOZART But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty. \nAll the bystanders are watching. \nSCHIKANEDER I've got a good one. I've got the perfect one for you. Come over here. \nMozart runs over to the forte-piano, and Schikaneder surrenders his place at it. \nSCHIKANEDER Now, I want you to play our tune - sitting backwards. \nApplause. \nMOZART Oh, that's really too easy. Any child can do that. \nAmused sounds of disbelief. \nSCHIKANEDER And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian Bach. \nRenewed applause at this wicked extra penalty. Mozart smiles at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves. He defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his back to the keyboard. Before the astonished eyes of the company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task. His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been dancing. \nAttracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer to the instrument. So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of the bystanders. Constanze watches him approach. Only Leopold sits by himself, sulking. \nThe fugue ends amidst terrific clapping. The guests call out to Mozart. \nGUESTS Another! Do another! Someone else. \nMOZART Give me a name. Who shall I do? Give me a name. \nGUESTS Gluck! Haydn! Frederic Handel! \nCONSTANZE Salieri! Do Salieri! \nSMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her. \nMOZART Now that's hard. That's very hard. For Salieri one has to face the right way around. \nGiggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard. Then, watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody. \nHe furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his eyes. Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and dominant, endlessly repeated. The music is the very essence of banality. The bystanders rock with laughter. Mozart starts to giggle wildly. Through this excruciating scene, Salieri stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks challengingly back at him. \nMozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a fart noise instead of notes to end cadences. He builds this up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly he stops and cries out. The laughter cuts off. Mozart stands up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his breeches. The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl of laughter. \nCU, Salieri staring in pain. \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 \nCU, The old man is shaking at the very recollection of his humiliation. \nOLD SALIERI Go on. Mock me. Laugh, laugh! \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. GROTTO - NIGHT - 1780'S \nA repetition of the shot of Mozart at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S \nSalieri sits at his desk. He holds in his hand the small black party mask and stares in hatred at the place on the wall where the crucifix used to hang. Faintly we see the mark of the cross. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) That was not Mozart laughing, Father. That was God. That was God! God laughing at me through that obscene giggle. Go on, Signore. Laugh. Rub my nose in it. Show my mediocrity for all to see. You wait! I will laugh at You! Before I leave this earth, I will laugh at You! Amen! \nINT. MOZART'S WORKROOM - DAY - 1780'S \nIt is littered with manuscripts. In the middle stands a billiard table. The beautiful closing ensemble from Act IV of Figaro: Ah, Tutti contenti! Saremo cosi plays in the background. Standing at the billiard table, Mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table. \nFrom time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes. He is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation. Presently, however, we hear a knocking at the door. \nCONSTANZE (outside the door) Wolfi! Wolfgang! \nThe music breaks off. \nMOZART What is it? \nHe opens the door. \nCONSTANZE There's a young girl to see you. \nMOZART What does she want? \nCONSTANZE I don't know. \nINT. SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT - 1780'S \nThe music fades. We see Lorl, dressed in a walking cloak, sitting before a desk, talking to someone confidentially. \nLORL They're out every night, sir. Till all hours. \nA hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits. On its finger we see the gold signet ring belonging to Salieri. \nLORL (taking one) Oh, thank you, sir. \nSALIERI Do any pupils come to the house? \nLORL Not that I've seen. \nSALIERI Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all? \nLORL Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat. \nSALIERI Really? What is it he's writing? \nLORL Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir. \nSALIERI Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you? \nConfused, the girl hesitates. He hands her a pile of coins. \nLORL Oh, thank you, sir! \nShe accepts them, delighted. \nEXT. MOZART'S HOUSE - VIENNA STREET - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nThe final movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto in E-flat (K. 482) begins. To its lively music, the door of the house bursts open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street. Following them immediately appear Wolfgang, Constanze and Leopold, all three dressed for an occasion. They climb into a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte-piano. As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight. Then she shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AN ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - VIENNA - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nAn outdoor concert is being given. Mozart is actually playing the final movement of his E-flat concerto with an orchestra. Listening to him is a sizable audience, including the Emperor, flanked by Strack and Von Swieten. \nThe crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood: it is a delightful open-air scene. We hear the gayest and most complex passage. Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays his own work brilliantly. We stay with this scene for a little while and then \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VIENNA STREET - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nA carriage clopping through the streets. Lorl is sitting up on the box beside the driver. Inside the vehicle, we glimpse the figure of Salieri. \nEXT. AN ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - VIENNA - 1780'S \nWe hear more of the concerto. Perhaps the slow interlude in the last movement of K. 482. Mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood. Abruptly we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOZART' S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nLorl is opening the door admitting Salieri. They go in. The door shuts. \nINT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nThe room is considerably tidier as a result of Lorl's ministrations. Salieri stands looking about him with tremendous curiosity. \nLORL I think I've found out about the money, sir. \nSALIERI Yes what? \nShe opens a drawer in a sideboard. Inside we see one gold snuff box: it is the one we saw Mozart being presented with as a child in the Vatican. \nLORL He kept seven snuff boxes in here. I could swear they were all gold. And now look there's only one left. And inside, sir, look - I counted them - tickets from the pawnshop. Six of them. \nSalieri turns to look around him. \nSALIERI Where does he work? \nLORL In there, sir. \nShe points across the room to the workroom. Salieri crosses and goes in alone. \nINT. MOZART'S WORKROOM - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nSalieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus. He is immensely excited. He moves slowly into the 'holy of holies' picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball; a discarded wig; a sock; a buckle - then objects more important to him. Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather. He touches the inkstand. He lays a finger on the candlestick with its half-expired candle. He touches each object as if it were the memento of a beloved. He is in awe. Finally his eye falls on the sheets of music themselves. Stealthily he picks them up. \nCU, The pages. \nWe see words set to music. Against each line of notes is the name of a character: Contessa, Susanna, Cherubino. Then another page - the title page - written in Mozart's hand. \nLe Nozze di Figaro Comedia per musica tratta dal Francese in quattro atti. \nCU, The word Figaro. \nCU, Salieri. He stares amazed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - VIENNA - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nMozart is playing the cadenza and coda of Piano Concerto (K. 482). He completes the work with a flourish. There is loud applause. The Emperor rises and all follow suit. Mozart comes down to be greeted by him. \nJOSEPH Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man. \nMOZART Thank you, Sire! \nVON SWIETEN Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine. \nMOZART Baron! \nHe sees his wife and father standing by in the crowd. Leopold is signaling insistently. \nMOZART Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour? \nJOSEPH What is it? \nJOSEPH Do you like this, Salieri? \nSALIERI It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid. \nJOSEPH Well, look at them. \nWe do look at them. The spectacle on stage has now ground to a complete halt. \nJOSEPH No, no, no! This is nonsense. Let me hear the scene with the music. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG But, Sire - \nJOSEPH Oblige me. \nOrsini-Rosenberg acknowledges his defeat. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Yes, Majesty. \nOrsini-Rosenberg rises and goes down to where Mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Can we see the scene with the music back, please? \nMOZART Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director! \nHe looks back deliriously at Salieri, trying to indicate his gratitude. Salieri acknowledges with a slight and subtle nod. \nOrsini-Rosenberg returns to his king. \nMOZART Ladies and gentlemen, we're going from where we stopped. The Count: Anches so. Right away, please! \nThe singers scatter offstage to begin the scene again. \nJOSEPH (to Orsini-Rosenberg) What I hoped by that edict, Director, was simply to prevent hours of dancing like in French opera. There it is endless, as you know. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Quite so, Majesty. \nCUT BACK TO Mozart at the forte-piano, raising his hands. The musicians raise their bows. With a flourish the happy composer begins a reprise of the scene which had been cut out. The music of the march begins faintly; the celebrants of Figaro's wedding start to enter as the Count and the Countess sit in their chairs. \nIn the theatre we see increasing pleasure on the Emperor's face, sullenness and defeat on the courtiers'. Then, suddenly, without interruption, on a crescendo repeat of the march, we \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S \nThe theatre is brilliantly lit for the first public performance of Figaro. Everybody is there: the Emperor, Von Strack, Bonno Orsini-Rosenberg, Von Swieten, even Madame Weber and her daughters in a box. The musicians all wear imperial livery; the actors on stage are now in costume. Mozart, conducting, wears his Order of the Golden Spur. The company wheels in and around to the music of the restored march, which reaches a triumphant climax. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 \nOLD SALIERI (to Vogler) So Figaro was produced in spite of me. And in spite of me, a wonder was revealed. One of the true wonders of art. The restored third act was bold and brilliant. The fourth was a miracle. \nThe descending scale of strings in the final ensemble (Ah, Tutti contenti. Saremo cosi) fades in. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S \nWe see the tableau on stage with the Count kneeling to the Countess. All are singing. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) I saw a woman disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first tender words he has offered her in years, only because he thinks she is someone else. I heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre, conferring on all who sat there a perfect absolution. God was singing through this little man to all the world - unstoppable - making my defeat more bitter with each passing bar. \nCU, Salieri in his box, tears on his cheeks. He watches the ensemble and we listen to it for a long moment. Finally it fades, but continues underneath the following: \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 \nOLD SALIERI And then suddenly - a miracle! \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S \nThe ensemble reaches its climax, and fades away to the very quiet, slow chords immediately preceding the boisterous final chord. Salieri becomes aware that some of the audience are asleep and many mare are apathetic. In the near silence we see the Emperor yawn behind his hand. Those nearby look at him. Orsini-Rosenberg smiles. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 \nOLD SALIERI Father, did you know what that meant? With that yawn I saw my defeat turn into a victory. And Mozart was lucky the Emperor only yawned once. Three yawns and the opera would fail the same night; two yawns, within a week at most. With one yawn the composer could still get - \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALIERI'S SALON - DAY - 1780'S \nMozart is pacing up and down. Salieri is listening sympathetically. \nMOZART Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn. \nSALIERI I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully. \nMOZART But what is it they don't like? \nSALIERI Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four. \nMOZART What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all? \nSALIERI I think it's marvelous. Truly. \nMOZART It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come? \nSALIERI I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap? \nMOZART I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that. \nSALIERI (fuming) I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me. \nMOZART Oh no, the honour would be all mine. \nSALIERI (bowing) Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang! \nMOZART Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio! \nHe bows too, giggling. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) And I knew - only I understood - that the horrifying apparition was Leopold, raised from the dead. Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father to accuse his son before all the world. It was terrifying and wonderful to watch. \nMusic swells up again. We watch the scene on stage as the Commendatore addresses Giovanni. Then back to Salieri in the box. Music down again. \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 \nOLD SALIERI Now a madness began in me. The madness of a man splitting in half. Through my influence I saw to it Don Giovanni was played only five times in Vienna. But in secret I went to every one of those five - all alone - unable to help myself, worshipping sound I alone seemed to hear. \nINT. AN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) And hour after hour, as I stood there, understanding even more clearly how that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son from beyond the grave, I began to see a way - a terrible way - I could finally triumph over God, my torturer. \nMusic swells. On stage Don Giovanni is seized and gripped by the Statue's icy hand. Flames burst from obviously artificial rocks. Demons appear and drag the libertine down to Hell. The scene ends. \nCU, Salieri, staring wide-eyed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S \nWe see huge and attractive posters and billboards advertising Schikaneder's troupe. The camera concentrates on the one which reads as follows: \nEMMANUEL SCHIKANEDER Impresario de luxe PRESENTS The Celebrated SCHIKANEDER TROUPE OF PLAYERS IN An Evening of PARODY Music!  Mirth!  Magic! ALL SONGS AND SPEECHES WRITTEN BY EMMANUEL SCHIKANEDER who personally will appear in every scene! \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1780'S \nNoise; smoke; the audience is sitting at tables for an evening of vaudeville. Mozart, Constanze and their son Karl, now about two years old, and sitting on his mother's lap, are watching a parody scene by Schikaneder's troupe. They are rowdy, bawdy and silly, incorporating motifs, situations and tunes from Mozart's operas which we have seen and heard. Before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer, plates of sausages, etc. \nTHE PARODY \nOn stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in Don Giovanni's palace, shown before. \nSchikaneder as Don Giovanni is dancing with the three actresses to the minuet from Don Giovanni (end of Act I), played by a quartet of tipsy musicians. Leporello is handing around wine on a tray. \nSuddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside. The music slithers to a stop. All look at each other in panic. Leporello drops his tray with a crash. All go quiet. One more knock is heard. Then all musicians, actresses, Don Giovanni and Leporello make a dash to hide under the table which is far too small to accommodate them all. The table rocks. Schikaneder is pushed out. He is terrified. He shakes elaborately. Three more knocks are heard; louder. \nSCHIKANEDER Who is it? \nOne more knock. \nSCHIKANEDER C-c-c-come in! \nIn the pit a chromatic scale from the Overture to Don Giovanni turns into a anticipatory vamp. This grows more and more menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the back falls down. \nAn absurd pantomime horse gallops in. It has a ridiculous expression, and is manned by four men inside. Standing precariously on its back is a dwarf, wearing a miniature version of the armour and helmet worn by the Commendatore. He sings in a high, nasal voice: \nCOMMENDATORE (singing) Don Giovannnnnnnnnni! \nHe tries to keep his balance as he trots in, but fails. He falls off onto the stage. He beats at the horse, trying to get back on. \nCOMMENDATORE Down! Down! \nBewildered, the horse looks about him, but cannot see his small rider who is below his level of sight. \nCOMMENDATORE I'm here! I'm here! \nThe horse, amidst laughter from the audience, fails to locate him. Exasperated, the dwarf signals to someone in the wings. A tall man strides out carrying a see-saw; on his shoulders stands another man. \nThe dwarf stands on the lowered end of the see-saw. There is a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end and the Commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the horse, only backwards so that he is facing away from Don Giovanni. The two men bow to the applauding audience, and retire off-stage. \nThe Commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper menacing attitude, and at the same time turn around to face Don Giovanni. This he finds difficult. \nCOMMENDATORE (singing) Don Giovannnnnnnni! \nSCHIKANEDER Who the devil are you? What do you want? \nCOMMENDATORE (singing) I've come to dinnnnnner! \nSCHIKANEDER Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height. \nCOMMENDATORE Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio! \nThe horse takes a bow. The dwarf almost falls off again. \nCOMMENDATORE Whoa! Whoa! Stop it! \nThe three girls rush to his aid and reach him just in time. They sing in the manner of the Tree Ladies later to be put into The Magic Flute. \nFIRST LADY (running and singing) Be careful! \nSECOND LADY (running and singing) Be careful! \nTHIRD LADY (running and singing) Be careful! \nALL THREE TOGETHER (close harmony) Hold tight now! \nThey grab him. \nCOMMENDATORE (angry) Leave me alone! Stop it! I'm a famous horseman. \nOTTAVIO And I'm a famous horse! \nHe gives the ladies a radiant smile. The three ladies sing, as before, in close harmony. \nFIRST LADY (singing) He's adorable! \nSECOND LADY (singing) Adorable! \nTHIRD LADY (singing) Adorable! \nAn orchestral chord. The three ladies turn to Ottavio and sing to him. \nTHREE LADIES (singing together) Give me your hoof, my darling, And I'll give you my heart! Take me to your stable, And never more we'll part! \nOTTAVIO (singing: four male voices) I'm shy and very bashful. I don't know what to say. \nTHREE LADIES (singing together) Don't hesitate a second. Just answer yes and neigh. \nOttavio neighs loudly, and runs at the girls. \nWild applause. \nIt flies into the audience. Immediately all the cast start humming the lyrical finale from Figaro: Tutti Contenti. More and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the theatre. Everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins to eat. The end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and magical, and then, suddenly, the tempo changes and the coarse strains of Ich Mochte wohl Der Kaiser take over and the whole company is dancing, frantically. A general dance as the curtain falls. \nIt rises immediately. The audience - including Mozart - is delighted. They applaud vigorously. Schikaneder takes a bow amongst his troupe. Among much whistling and clapping, he finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience toward the table where Mozart sits with his family. On stage, a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old German tune. Some of the audience joins in singing it. \nSCHIKANEDER Well, how do you like that? \nMozart is smiling; he has been amused. Constanze has been less amused and is looking apprehensive. \nMOZART Wonderful! (indicating his baby son) He liked the monkey, didn't you? \nSCHIKANEDER Yes, well, it's all good fun. \nMOZART I liked the horse. \nSchikaneder sits at the table, and drinks from a bottle of wine. \nSCHIKANEDER Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them. \nMOZART I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it. \nSCHIKANEDER 'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those. \nMOZART Animals? \nSCHIKANEDER I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle. \nMozart laughs. \nSCHIKANEDER I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German. \nMOZART German! \nSCHIKANEDER Of course! What else do you think they speak here? \nMOZART No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio. \nSCHIKANEDER So there you are. What do you say? \nCONSTANZE How much will you pay him? \nSCHIKANEDER Ah. Well. Ah, (to Mozart) I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts? \nMOZART Half the receipts! Stanzi! \nCONSTANZE I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment? \nSCHIKANEDER Down payment? Who do you think I am? The Emperor? Whoops, I have to go. \nHe rises in haste for his next number. \nSCHIKANEDER Stay where you are. You're going to like this next one. We'll speak again. Triumph-de-luxe, my boy! \nHe winks at Mozart and disappears toward the stage. Mozart looks after him, enchanted. \nCONSTANZE You're not going to do this? \nMOZART Why not? Half the house! \nCONSTANZE When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it. \nMOZART Oh, Stanzi. \nCONSTANZE I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common. \nMOZART (to Karl) Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki. \nCONSTANZE Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand. \nMOZART (dirty) Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand! \nCONSTANZE Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money. \nHe giggles like a child. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCHLUMBERG HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 1780'S \nDogs are barking wickedly. Michael Schlumberg comes in from his salon. Mozart stands there looking very unwell and bewildered. He is also drunk, but making a careful attempt to keep his composure. \nSCHLUMBERG Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you? \nMOZART Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music? \nSCHLUMBERG Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man. \nMOZART Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction? \nSCHLUMBERG What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you? \nMOZART Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead? \nSCHLUMBERG What for? \nMOZART If a man cannot earn, he must borrow. \nSCHLUMBERG Well, this is hardly the way to go about it. \nMOZART No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours. \nPause. \nSCHLUMBERG I'm sorry. No. \nMOZART Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir. \nSCHLUMBERG My answer is no, Mozart. \nCU, Mozart. His voice becomes mechanical. \nVOGLER Yes. \nOLD SALIERI The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands. \nHe raises his own hands and stares at them. The raging Dies Irae from Mozart's Requiem Mass bursts upon us. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nMozart sits working frantically at this demonic music. His whole expression is one of wildness and engulfing fever. He pours wine down his throat, spilling it, and grimaces as it hits his stomach. All around him are manuscripts. \nThere is a banging at the front door. Mozart does not hear it; the music raves on. Another knocking comes, louder. Constanze appears from the bedroom and stares at her distracted husband. The knocking is repeated again, even more violently and insistently. \nCONSTANZE Wolfi. Wolfi! \nHe looks at her. The music breaks off. Silence. An enormous bang at the door startles him. \nConstanze moves to open it. \nMOZART No. Don't answer it! \nCONSTANZE Why? \nMozart springs up. He is clearly terrified. \nMOZART Tell him I'm not here. Tell him I'm working on it. Come back later. \nHe runs out of he room, into his workroom, and shuts he door. Now a little scared herself, Constanze goes to he front door and opens it cautiously. Schikaneder stands there, floridly dressed as usual. Lorl is seen peeking out from the kitchen. \nSCHIKANEDER Am I interrupting something? \nCONSTANZE Not at all. \nSCHIKANEDER (peering into he room) Where's our friend? \nCONSTANZE He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you. \nSCHIKANEDER I hope so. I need it immediately. \nHe pushes her into the room. \nSCHIKANEDER Is he happy with it? \nHe sees he manuscript on the table, and goes to it eagerly. \nSCHIKANEDER Is this it? \nHe picks up a page without waiting for a reply. \nSCHIKANEDER What the devil is this? Requiem Mass? Does he think I'm in the funeral business? \nMozart opens he workroom door. We see him as Schikaneder sees him: wild-eyed, extremely pale and strange. \nMOZART Leave that alone! \nSCHIKANEDER Wolfi! \nMOZART Put it down! \nSCHIKANEDER What is this? \nMOZART Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you. \nSCHIKANEDER Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished? \nMOZART What? \nSCHIKANEDER What? The vaudeville, what'd you think? \nMOZART Yes. \nSCHIKANEDER Can I see it? \nMOZART No. \nSCHIKANEDER Why not? \nMOZART Because there's nothing to see. \nHe giggles triumphantly. Schikaneder stares at him. \nSCHIKANEDER Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes. \nMOZART Well, we can. \nSCHIKANEDER So let me see it. Where is it? \nMozart, with a bright, rather demented smile presents his head to Schikaneder. \nMOZART Here. It's all right here, in my noodle. The rest is just scribbling. Scribbling and bibbling. Bibbling and scribbling. Would you like a drink? \nHe giggles. Schikaneder suddenly grabs his lapels. \nSCHIKANEDER Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting? \nCONSTANZE Leave him alone! \nSCHIKANEDER I'm paying these people. Do you realize that? \nCONSTANZE He's doing his best. \nSCHIKANEDER I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous! \nCONSTANZE You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff! \nSCHIKANEDER Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem? \nCONSTANZE Money! Money! \nSCHIKANEDER You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi. \nMOZART Yes, and on 'dictis'. \nSALIERI Yes! \nHe writes feverishly. \nMOZART And underneath, just violins - arpeggio. \nHe sings the violin figure under the Voca Me (Bars 7,8,9). \nMOZART (speaking) The descending scale in eighth notes, and then back suddenly to the fire again. \nHe sings the ostinato phrase twice. \nMOZART (speaking) And that's it. Do you have it? \nSALIERI You go fast! \nMOZART (urgently) Do you have it? \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now! \nThe entire Confutatis bursts over the room, as Mozart snatches the manuscript pages from Salieri and reads from it, singing. Salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment. The music continues right through the following scenes, to the end of the movement. \nEXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - WINTER NIGHT - 1790'S \nA carriage is driving fast through the night. Snow lies on the countryside. \nINT. THE CARRIAGE  NIGHT - 1790'S \nThe carriage is filled with passengers. Among them Constanze and Karl, her young son. They are sleepless and sway to the motion of the vehicle. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nMozart lying in bed exhausted, but still dictating urgently. We do not hear what he is saying to Salieri, who still sits writing assiduously. Mozart is looking very sick: sweat is pouring from his forehead. \nEXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - WINTER NIGHT - 1790'S \nThe carriage, moving through the night, to the sound of the music. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nMozart still dictating; Salieri still writing without stop. \nEXT. VIENNA STREET - DAWN - 1790'S. \nThe carriage has arrived. Constanze and her son alight with other passengers. Postillions attend to the horses. She takes her boy's hand. It is a cold wintry dawn. \nThe music stutters to a close. End of the Confutatis. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nMOZART Do you want to rest a bit? \nSALIERI Oh no. I'm not tired at all. \nMOZART We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa. \nSALIERI I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try? \nMOZART Would you stay with me while I sleep a little? \nSALIERI I'm not leaving you. \nMOZART I am so ashamed. \nSALIERI What for? \nMOZART I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me! \nMozart closes his eyes. Salieri stares at him. \nEXT. VIENNA STREET - WINTRY DAWN - 1790'S \nConstanze and Karl approach along the cobbled street, hand in hand toward their house. Snow lies in the street. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN - 1790'S \nMozart lies asleep in the bed, holding the last pages of the manuscript. Salieri lies across from him on Karl's small bed in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat. The child's bed is obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped position. \nEXT. MOZART'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAWN - 1790'S \nConstanze and Karl arrive at the door. They enter. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAWN - 1790'S \nIt is as disordered as before, save that the table, previously littered with pages, is now completely bare. Constanze looks at it with surprise and enters the bedroom. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN - 1790'S \nMozart is asleep in the bed. Salieri is dozing on the nearby child's bed. The room is full of the trailing smoke from guttering and guttered candles. Startled by Constanze's entrance and her young son, Salieri scrambles up. As he does so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly, so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look absurd. \nCONSTANZE What are you doing here? \nSALIERI Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home. \nCONSTANZE Why you? \nSALIERI I was at hand. \nCONSTANZE Well, thank you very much. You can go now. \nSALIERI He needs me, ma'am. \nCONSTANZE No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please. \nSALIERI He asked me to stay. \nCONSTANZE And I'm asking you - \n", "test1_input": "MOZART Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts. \nMOZART But, Your Majesty - \nJOSEPH (motioning him to be silent) Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here. \nMOZART Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics. \nJOSEPH I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece. \nThe others look at their king solemnly, all save Mozart. \nMOZART But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love. \nJOSEPH Ah, love again. \nMOZART But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that? \nJOSEPH I have no idea. \nMOZART Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it. \nJOSEPH Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight! \nMOZART Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives. \nVON SWIETEN Mozart - \nMOZART (ignoring him) Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous? \nVON SWIETEN Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes? \nMOZART Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends? \nVON SWIETEN (aroused) Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty. \nBONNO Bello! Bello, Barone. Veramente. \nMOZART Oh, bello, bello, bello! Come on now, be honest. Wouldn't you all rather listen to your hairdressers than Hercules? Or Horatius? Or Orpheus? All those old bores! people so lofty they sound as if they shit marble! \nVON SWIETEN What? \nVON STRACK Govern your tongue, sir! How dare you? \nBeat. All look at the Emperor. \nMOZART Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not. \nJOSEPH You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade. \nMOZART Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it? \nBONNO His Majesty has been more than patient, Signore. \nMOZART How can I persuade you if you won't let me show it? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG That will do, Herr Mozart! \nMOZART Just let me tell you how it begins. \nVON STRACK Herr Mozart - \nMOZART May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that? \nA slight pause. Then Joseph nods. \nJOSEPH Please. \nMozart falls on his knees. \nMOZART Look! There's a servant, down on his knees. Do you know why? Not from any oppression. No, he's simply measuring a space. Do you know what for? His bed. His wedding bed to see if it will fit. \nHe giggles. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OPERA HOUSE - DAY - 1780'S \nMozart sits on stage at a harpsichord rehearsing the singers taking the parts of Figaro and Susanna in the opening bars of the first act of The Marriage of Figaro. We watch Figaro measuring the space for his bed on the floor, singing and Susanna looking on, trying on the Countess' hat. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALIERI'S SALON - DAY - 1780'S \nOrsini-Rosenberg and Bonno are sitting with Salieri. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Well, Mozart is already rehearsing. \nSALIERI Incredible. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG The Emperor has given him permission. \nBONNO Si, si! Veramente. \nSALIERI Well, gentlemen, so be it. In that case I think we should help Mozart all we can and do our best to protect him against the Emperor's anger. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG What anger? \nSALIERI About the ballet. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Ballet? What ballet? \nSALIERI Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro? \nSALIERI Yes, in the third act. \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_true": "It is a full orchestral rehearsal. Mozart is conducting from the harpsichord with his hands; he does not use a baton. The singers are all in practice clothes, not costumes. \nWe are in the Act III and we hear the recitativo exchange just before the march begins. Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno sit watching chairs. \nSuddenly the march starts. Peasants and friends start to dance in and at the same moment, Orsini-Rosenberg gets up and comes down to Mozart. He is accompanied by an anxious Bonno. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away. \nMOZART Certainly, Herr Director. \nHe signals to the cast to break off. \nMOZART Five minutes, please! \nThe company disperses, curious. The musicians look at Orsini- Rosenberg. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas? \nMOZART Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Exactly. A dance. \nMOZART But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please. \nMozart hands him the score from which he is conducting. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Thank you. \nHe rips out a page. Bonno watches in terror. \nMOZART What are you doing? \nHe rips out three more. \nMOZART What are you doing, Herr Director? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Taking out what you should never have put in. \nHe goes on tearing the pages determinedly. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALIERI'S SALON - DAY - 1780'S \nA servant opens the door to announce. \nSERVANT Herr Mozart. \nMozart brushes past him straight towards Salieri, who rises to greet him. The little man is near hysterics. \nMOZART Please! Please. I've no one else to turn to. Please! \nHe grabs Salieri. \nSALIERI Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter? \nMOZART It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it. \nSALIERI Really? Why? \nMOZART I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him? \nSALIERI Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours. \nMOZART Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry! \nSALIERI You burned the score? \nMOZART Oh no! My wife took it out in time. \nSALIERI How fortunate. \nMOZART It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work. \nSALIERI But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor. \nMOZART Oh, Excellency, would you? \nSALIERI With all my heart, Mozart. \nMOZART Thank you! Oh, thank you. \nHe kisses Salieri's hand. \nSALIERI (withdrawing it; imitating the Emperor) No, no, no, Herr Mozart, please. It's not a holy relic. \nMozart giggles with relief and gratitude. \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 \nOLD SALIERI I'm sure I don't need to tell you I said nothing whatever to the Emperor. I went to the theatre ready to tell Mozart that His Majesty had flown into a rage when I mentioned the ballet, when suddenly, to my astonishment, in the middle of the third act, the Emperor - who never attended rehearsals - suddenly appeared. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE - DAY - 1780'S \nIn the background the same recitativo before the March. The Emperor steals in surreptitiously with Von Strack, his finger to his lips. He motions everyone not to rise, and slips into a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno. \nThe three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed. \nThe recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is silence. Mozart lays down his baton. The musicians lay down their instruments. The celebrants of Figaro's wedding come in with a few pitiful dance steps, in procession, only to come presently to a halt, lacking their music. The singers try to go on singing, but they have no cues from their conductor or from the accompaniment. Everyone on stage looks lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while. Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre.  Finally, the Emperor speaks, in a whisper. \nJOSEPH What is this? I don't understand. Is it modern? \nBONNO Majesty, the Herr Director, he has removed a balleto that would have occurred at this place. \nJOSEPH Why? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG It is your regulation, Sire. No ballet in your opera. \nMozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot. \n", "test1_id": 720, "test2_input": "EXT. VIENNA STREET - NIGHT - 1790'S \nMozart, drunk and happy, staggers back through the snow. There are a few people about. He goes into his apartment building. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - DAY - 1790'S \nHe comes through he door and stares across the living room at an open bedroom door. Puzzled, he crosses. \nThe bedroom is also empty. We see Constanze's empty bed; Karl's empty bed; empty closets. \nMOZART Stanzi? Stanzi-marini-bini? \nHe looks about him, puzzled. \nINT. FRAU WEBER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1790'S \nFrau Weber sits grimly talking. Mozart sits also, completely exhausted and passive under the rain of her constant speech. \nFRAU WEBER She's not coming back, you know. She's gone for good. I did it and I'm proud of it. 'Leave,' I said. 'Right away! Take he child and go, just go. Here's the money! Go to the Spa and get your health back - that's if you can.' I was shocked. Shocked to my foundation. Is that my girl? Can that be my Stanzi? The happy little moppet I brought up, that poor trembling thing? Oh, you monster! No one exists but you, do they? You and your music! Do you know how often she's sat in that very chair, weeping her eyes out of her head because of you? I warned her. 'Choose a man, not a baby,' I said. But would she listen? Who listens? 'He's just a silly boy,' she says. Silly, my arse. Selfish - that's all you are. Selfish! Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish. \nAnd with a scream Madame Weber's voice turns into the shrill packing coloratura of the second act aria of the Queen of the Night, in The Magic Flute. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S \nOn stage we see the QUEEN OF THE NIGHT fantastically costumed, furiously urging her daughter to kill Sarastro. As she sings, we see the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged from when we last visited it to watch the Cabaret. An audience of ordinary German citizens stands in the pit area, or sits: they are rapt and excited. \nThe theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed curtains - their inhabitants presumably engaged in private intimacies. In one of them sits Salieri. \nQUEEN OF THE NIGHT (singing furiously) A hellish wrath within my heart is seething! Death and destruction Flame around my throne! If not by thee Sarastro's light be extinguished. Then be thou mine own daughter never more! Rejected be forever! So sundered be forever All the bonds of kin and blood! Hear! Hear! Hear God of Vengeance! Hear thy Mother's vow! \nThunder and lightning. She disappears amidst tremendous applause from the audience. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S \nOn the poster for The Magic Flute, the name Emmanuel Schikaneder should appear very, very large and the name of Mozart quite small: \nI. & R. priv. Weiden Theatre The Actors of the Imperial and Royal Privileged Theatre of the Weiden Have the honour to perform THE MAGIC FLUTE A Grand Opera in Two Acts By Emmanuel Schikaneder (The Cast List) \nThe music is by Herr Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Herr Mozart out of respect for a gracious and honourable Public, and from friendship for the author of this piece, will today direct the orchestra in person. \nThe book of the opera, furnished with two copperplates, of which is engraved Herr Schikaneder in the costume he wears for the role of Papageno, may be had at the box office for 30 kr. \nPrices of admission are as usual To begin at 7 o'clock \nINT. STAGE, AUDITORIUM AND WINGS OF SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT -1790'S \nWe CUT TO the scene immediately before Papageno's song, Ein Madchen oder Weibchen. Papageno, played by Schikaneder, dressed in his costume of feathers, is trying to get through a mysterious door. A voice calls from within. \nVOICE Go back! \nPapageno recoils. \nPAPAGENO Merciful Gods! If only I knew by which door I came in. (to audience) Which was it? Was it this one? Come on, tell me! \nVOICE Go back! \nPapageno recoils. \nPAPAGENO Now, I can't go forward and I can't go back. Oh, this is awful! \nHe weeps extravagantly. \nIn the pit, Mozart indicates to the first violinist to take over as conductor. He slips from his place and goes stealthily backstage. We follow him. Over the scene we hear Papageno being addressed by the First Priest in stern tones. \nFIRST PRIEST (on stage) Man, thou hast deserved to wander forever in the darkest chasms of the earth. The gentle Gods have remitted thy punishment, but yet thou shalt never feel the Divine Content of the consecrated ones. \nPAPAGENO Oh well, I'm not alone in that. Just give me a decent glass of wine - that's divine content enough for me. \nLaughter. An enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth. \nWe follow Mozart into the wings. Actors and actresses stand around in fantastic costumes. We see a flying chariot and parts of a huge snake lying about. Also the scenery door of a temple with the word 'Wisdom' inscribed on the pediment. Mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel with several manuals, and a musician waiting to play it. Silently Mozart indicates that he wishes to play the instrument himself. \nOn stage Schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the First Priest. \nFIRST PRIEST Man, hast thou no other desire on earth, but just to eat and drink? \nPAPAGENO (Schikaneder) Well! \nLaughter from the audience. \nPAPAGENO Well, actually I do have a rather weird feeling in my heart. Perhaps it's just indigestion. But you know, I really would like - I really do want - something even nicer than food and drink. Now what on earth could that be? \nHe stares at the audience and winks at them. They laugh. \nNow Papageno's aria (Ein Madchen oder Weibchen) begins. It is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells, with the glockenspiel actually being played off-stage by Mozart. Schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see Mozart conducting. He looks into the wings and realizes the situation with amusement. He sings joyfully and the audience watches entranced. \nANDANTE A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish! \nALLEGRO Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine! \nANDANTE (encore, lightly, as before) A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. \nALLEGRO I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade! \nANDANTE (encore) A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. \nALLEGRO At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown! \nAt certain moments we see the stage from Salieri's point of view: Schikaneder singing, then pretending to play; and then we see Mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes in the wings. Then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and no sound comes. He mimes again, but still nothing comes. He looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion. People are looking down on the floor. The song comes to a near-halt. Schikaneder stares. Then the comedian signals to the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it. At this moment Salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WINGS OF SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S \nWe see the actress playing Papagena, wearing an old tattered cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a hideous old woman over her face. She is looking worriedly down at Mozart, who is lying unconscious on the floor. \nA few people around him are trying to revive him. One has put a wet handkerchief around his temples. Another is holding a small bottle of smelling salts. There are voices saying, 'Doctor! Take him to a dressing room. Someone call a carriage. Take him home.' Etc. Papagena is urged to go on stage by a distracted stage manager. Suddenly we hear the voice of Salieri. \n", "test2_true": "He steps forward. \nSALIERI I have a carriage. Excuse me. \nThe actors step back respectfully. He stoops and picks up the frail composer in his arms. Mozart is quite limp and Salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck. All this is watched nervously by Schikaneder on stage whilst performing his scene with Papagena as an ugly old woman. \nUGLY OLD WOMAN Here I am, my angel. \nPAPAGENO (appalled) What? Who the devil are you? \nUGLY OLD WOMAN I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish. \nPAPAGENO Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck. \nAudience laughter. The actress raises the little painted cloth with the ugly old face on it to show her own pretty young one to the audience. More laughter. \nUGLY OLD WOMAN Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you. \nPAPAGENO (nervous) I can't wait. \nUGLY OLD WOMAN Well, promise then. \nPAPAGENO What do you mean - now? \nUGLY OLD WOMAN Of course now. Right away, before I get any older. \nLaughter. \nPAPAGENO Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough? \nUGLY OLD WOMAN (amorously) Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you. \nLaughter. \nEXT. SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S \nA waiting sedan chair. Mozart has recovered consciousness, but looks exceedingly ill. Salieri has set him down in the winter's night. Snow is falling. \nMOZART What happened? Is it over? \nSALIERI I'm taking you home. You're not well. \nMOZART No, no. I have to get back. I have - \nHe starts to collapse again. Salieri helps him into the sedan. The door is shut. The chair sets off and Salieri strides beside it, through the mean street. A lantern with a candle swings from the chair. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nThe door opens. Salieri enters carrying the lantern from the sedan chair. He is followed by Mozart, carried in the arms of one of the porters. The room is now really in complete disarray. The table is piled high with music: the pages of the Requiem lie amongst many empty wine bottles. The porter carries Mozart into \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nThis room is miserably neglected. The bed is unmade, clothes lie about on the floor. A sock has been stuck into the broken pane of one window. \nThe porter lays Mozart down on the bed as Salieri lights candles from the lantern to reveal plates of half-eaten food and other signs left by a man whose wife has departed. It is obviously very cold. Another very small bed nearby belongs to the child, Karl. \nSALIERI (handing the porter the lantern) Thank you. Go. \nThe porter leaves the room. Mozart stirs. \nMOZART (vaguely singing) Papa! Papa! \nHe opens his eyes and sees Salieri staring down at him. He smiles. \nSALIERI Come now. \nHe helps him to sit up and takes off his coat and his shoes and puts a coverlet around him. \nSALIERI Where is your wife? \nMOZART Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa. \nSALIERI You mean she's not coming back? \nMOZART You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you. \nSALIERI No, please. \nMOZART I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did. \nHe struggles to loosen his cravat. Salieri does it for him. \nSALIERI I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that. \nMOZART This is only a vaudeville. \nSALIERI Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me. \nMOZART Do you mean that? \nSALIERI I do. \nMOZART I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things. \nSALIERI Are you ill? \nMOZART The doctor thinks I am. But - \nSALIERI What? \nMOZART I'm too young to be so sick. \nThere is a violent knocking at the front door. Mozart starts and looks around wildly. \nSALIERI Shall I answer it? \nMOZART No! No, it's him! \nSALIERI Who? \nMOZART The man. He's here. \n", "test2_id": 721, "test3_input": "SALIERI What man? \nThe knocking increases in loudness, terrifying Mozart. \nMOZART Tell him to go away. Tell him I'm still working on it. Don't let him in! \nSalieri moves to the door. \nMOZART Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it. \nSALIERI Finish what? \nMOZART He knows. He knows! \nSalieri leaves the room. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nSalieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal Schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre. He still wears his bird make-up and under his street cloak, his feathered costume is clearly seen. He has with him the three actresses, also looking anxious and also in make-up as the three attendants in The Magic Flute. \nSCHIKANEDER Herr Salieri. \nSALIERI Yes, I am looking after him. \nSCHIKANEDER Can we come in? \nSALIERI Well, he's sleeping now. Better not. \nSCHIKANEDER But he's all right? \nSALIERI Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest. \nSCHIKANEDER Well, tell him we were here, won't you? \nSALIERI Of course. \nSCHIKANEDER And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times. \nSALIERI Bene. \nSCHIKANEDER I'll call tomorrow. \nSALIERI Yes. (to the actresses) And congratulations to all of you. It was superb. \nACTRESSES Thank you! Thank you, Excellency! \nSchikaneder produces a bag of money. \nSCHIKANEDER Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh? \nSALIERI Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly! \nACTRESSES (delighted) Goodnight, Your Excellency. Goodnight! \nThey bob and curtsey. Schikaneder stares at Salieri, uneasily, vaguely suspicious. Salieri smiles back at him and shuts the door. He stays for a moment, thinking. He contemplates the money. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nMozart is sitting up in bed, staring at the door. It opens. Salieri returns. He holds in his hand the bag of money. \nMOZART What happened? \nSalieri pours the coins out of the bag onto the coverlet. \nSALIERI He said to give you this. And if you finish the work by tomorrow night, he will pay you another hundred ducats. \nMozart looks at the coins astonished. \nMOZART Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred? \nSALIERI Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way? \nMOZART Would you? Actually, you could. \nSALIERI My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure. \nMOZART But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed. \nSALIERI Of course. \nMOZART You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write. \nSALIERI Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work? \nMOZART A Mass. A Mass for the Dead. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A SMALL DANCE HALL - BADEN - NIGHT - 1790'S \nTrivial dance music is playing. Constanze is doing a waltz with a young OFFICER in military uniform. At the moment we see her, she stops abruptly, as if in panic. \nOFFICER What is it? \nCONSTANZE I want to go! \nOFFICER Where? \nCONSTANZE I want to go back to Vienna. \nOFFICER Now? \nCONSTANZE Yes! \nOFFICER Why? \nCONSTANZE I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here. \nOFFICER (laying a hand on her arm) What are you talking about? \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "Mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows. The coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of bottles. Salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an improvised worktable. On it are blank sheets of music paper, quills, and ink. Also the score of the Requiem Mass as so far composed. Mozart is bright-eyed with a kind of fever. Salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire to put down the notes as quickly as Mozart can dictate them. \nMOZART Where did I stop? \nSALIERI (consulting the manuscript) The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra. \nMOZART So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that? \nSALIERI Consigned to flames of woe. \nMOZART Do you believe in it? \nSALIERI What? \nMOZART A fire which never dies. Burning one forever? \nSALIERI Oh, yes. \nMOZART Strange! \nSALIERI Come. Let's begin. \nHe takes his pen. \nSALIERI Confutatis Maledictis. \nMOZART We ended in F Major? \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART So now - A minor. Suddenly. \nSalieri writes the key signature. \nMOZART The Fire. \nSALIERI What time? \nMOZART Common time. \nSalieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly and urgently as he can, at Mozart's dictation. He is obviously highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates. His speed, however, can never be too fast for Mozart's impatient mind. \nMOZART Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. (singing the note) Con-fu-ta-tis. (speaking) Second measure, second beat. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis. (speaking) G-sharp, of course. \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART Third measure, second beat starting on E. (singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. (speaking) And fourth measure, fourth beat - D. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis. (speaking) Do you have that? \nSALIERI I think so. \nMOZART Sing it back. \nSalieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line. After the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on the soundtrack and engulfs his voice. They stop. \nMOZART Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. (singing) Con-fu-ta-tis. (speaking) Second measure, fourth beat on D. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis. (speaking) All right? \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART Fourth measure, second beat - F. (singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. \nHis voice is lost on the last words, as tenors engulf it and take over the soundtrack, singing their whole line from the beginning, right to the end of the sixth measure where the basses stopped, but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them. Salieri writes feverishly. We see his pen jotting down the notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page. The music stops again. \nMOZART Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. (He hurriedly hums the opening notes of the bass vocal line) The first bassoon and tenor trombone - \nSALIERI (labouring to keep up) Please! Just one moment. \nMozart glares at him, irritated. His hands move impatiently. Salieri scribbles frantically. \nMOZART It couldn't be simpler. \nSALIERI (finishing) First bassoon and tenor trombone - what? \nMOZART With the tenors. \nSALIERI Also identical? \nMOZART Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant. \nHe again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting. On the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line. We also hear the trumpets and timpani. The sound is bare and grim. It stops at the end of the sixth measure. Salieri stops writing. \nSALIERI And that's all? \nMOZART Oh no. Now for the Fire. (he smiles) Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this. \nHe sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato. \nMOZART (speaking) Second measure on B. \nHe sings the second measure of the ostinato. \nMOZART (speaking) Do you have me? \nSALIERI I think so. \nMOZART Show me. \nSalieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato. \nMOZART (excitedly) Good, good - yes! Put it down. And the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising - C to D to E, up to the dominant chord. Do you see? \nAs Salieri writes, Mozart sings the ostinato from the beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their agitated accompaniment. They stop. \nSALIERI That's wonderful! \nMOZART Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed. \nHe is now sitting bolt upright, hushed and inspired. \nMOZART C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. (singing the alto part) Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis. \nSALIERI Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'? \n", "test3_id": 722}

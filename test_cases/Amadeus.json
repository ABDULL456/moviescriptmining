OPERA HOUSE STAGE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S \nConstanze and Mozart make their way quickly through a crowd of actors in turbans and caftans, and stagehands carrying bits of the dismantled set of Seraglio. We see all the turmoil of backstage after a performance. \nA fireman passes Mozart carrying a small bucket of water. Mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the crowd to Madame Weber, who still lies prone on the stage. \nMozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws water on her face. She is instantly revived by the shock. Constanze assists her to rise. \nCONSTANZE Are you all right? \nInstead of being furious, Madame Weber smiles at them rapturously. \nMADAME WEBER Ah, what an evening! What a wise man we have for an Emperor. Oh, my children! (with sudden, hard briskness) Now I want you to write your father exactly what His Majesty said. \nThe activity continues to swirl around them. \nMOZART You should really go home now, Frau Weber. Your carriage must be waiting. \nMADAME WEBER But aren't you taking us? \nMOZART I have to talk to the singers. \nMADAME WEBER That's all right; we'll wait for you. Just don't take all night. \nINT. CAVALIERI'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S \nCavalieri, still in costume, is marching up and down, very agitated. \nCAVALIERI Did you know? Had you heard? \nSALIERI What? \nCAVALIERI The marriage! \nSALIERI Well, what does it matter to you? \nCAVALIERI Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn. \nShe catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself. \nCAVALIERI How was I? Tell me honestly. \nSALIERI You were sublime. \nCAVALIERI What did you think of the music? \nSALIERI Extremely clever. \nCAVALIERI Meaning you didn't like it. \nMozart comes in unexpectedly. \nMOZART Oh - excuse me! \nCAVALIERI Is her mother still lying on the floor? \nMOZART No, she's fine. \nCAVALIERI I'm so relieved. \nShe seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig. \nSALIERI Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations. \nMOZART Did you like it, then? \nSALIERI How could I not? \nMOZART It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree? \nCAVALIERI Is she a good fuck? \nMOZART What?? \nCAVALIERI I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that. \nSalieri looks astonished. There is a knock on the door. \nCAVALIERI Come in! \nThe door opens. Constanze enters. \nCONSTANZE Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now? \nMOZART Of course. \nCAVALIERI No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang? \nMOZART Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore. \nMozart hurries Constanze out of the door. Cavalieri looks after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of control. \nCAVALIERI You really are full of surprises, aren't you? You are quite extraordinary, you little shit! \nShe turns and collapses, crying with rage, into Salieri's arms. We focus on him. \nOLD SALIERI (V.O.) At that moment I knew beyond any doubt. He'd had her. The Creature had had my darling girl. \nINT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1820'S \n", "test1_true": "OLD SALIERI It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them. \nVOGLER Did you try? \nOLD SALIERI Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray! \nINT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY - 1780'S \nThe young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross. \nSALIERI Please! Please! Send him away, back to Salzburg. For his sake as well as mine. \nCU, Christ staring from the Cross. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. AUDIENCE HALL - ARCHBISHOP'S PALACE - SALZBURG - DAY - 1780'S \nWe see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne. Count Arco stands beside him. Leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier. \nCOLLOREDO No! I won't have him back. \nLEOPOLD But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding. \nCOLLOREDO Hardly. \nLEOPOLD Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him. \nCOLLOREDO I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him. \nLEOPOLD Sir - \nCOLLOREDO Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat. \nLEOPOLD Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully. \nCOLLOREDO And how will you make him keep it? \nLEOPOLD Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance. \nCOLLOREDO You have leave to try. \nLEOPOLD Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you! \nIn deepest gratitude he kisses the Archbishop's hand. He motions Leopold to rise. We hear the first dark fortissimo chord which begins the Overture to Don Giovanni: the theme associated with the character of the Commendatore. \nLEOPOLD (V.O.) My dear son. \nThe second fortissimo chord sounds. \nINT. A BAROQUE CHURCH - DAY - 1780'S \nWe see a huge CU, of Mozart's head, looking front and down, as if reading his father's letter. We hear Leopold's voice over this image, no longer whining and anxious, but impressive. \nLEOPOLD (V.O.) I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming. \nMOZART I will. \nThe camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling beside Constanze. A PRIEST faces them. Behind them are Madame Weber, Josefa and Sophie Weber, and a very few others. Among them, a merry looking lady in bright clothes: the BARONESS WALDSTADTEN. \nPRIEST And will you, Constanze Weber, take this man, Wolfgang to be your lawful husband? \nCONSTANZE I will. \nPRIEST I now pronounce you man and wife. \nThe opening kyrie of the great Mass in C Minor is heard. Mozart and Constanze kiss. They are in tears. Madame Weber and her daughters look on approvingly. The music swells and continues under the following: \nINT. A ROOM IN LEOPOLD'S HOUSE - SALZBURG - NIGHT - 1780'S \nThere is a view of a castle in background. Leopold sits alone in his room. He is reading a letter from Wolfgang. At his feet are his trunks, half-packed for the journey he will not now take. We hear Mozart's voice reading the following letter and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of the young prodigy's early life: the little forte-piano made for him; the little violin made for him; an Order presented to him. We see a little starling in a wicker cage. And we see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the familiar family portrait of Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl seated at the keyboard with Leopold standing, and the picture of their mother on the wall behind them. \nMOZART (V.O.) Most beloved father, it is done. Do not blame me that I did not wait to see your dear face. I knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and I could not have borne it. Your every word is precious to me. Remember how you have always told me Vienna is the City of Musicians. To conquer here is to conquer Europe! With my wife I can do it.  I vow I will become regular in my habits and productive as never before. She is wonderful, Papa, and I know that you will love her. And one day soon when I am a wealthy man, you will come and live with us, and we will be so happy. I long for that day, best of Papas, and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times. \nThe music of the Mass fades as Leopold crumples the letter in his hand. \nEXT. THE IMPERIAL GARDENS - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S \nSalieri stands waiting, hat in hand. Beside him stands a royal servant. Behind him, gardeners are glimpsed tending the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride. Down this ride are seen cantering two people on horseback: the Emperor Joseph and his niece, the PRINCESS ELIZABETH. They are mounted on glossy horses. The Princess rides side-saddle. Running beside her is a panting groom. The Emperor rides elegantly; his niece, a dumpy little Hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack of potatoes. As they draw level with Salieri they stop, and the groom holds the head of the Princess' horse. Salieri bows respectfully. \nJOSEPH Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth. \nSALIERI Your Highness. \nOut of breath, the Princess nods nervously. \nJOSEPH She has asked me to advise her on a suitable musical instructor. I think I've come up with an excellent idea. \nHe smiles at Salieri. \nSALIERI Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour! \nJOSEPH I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view? \nSalieri's face falls, almost imperceptibly. \nSALIERI An interesting idea, Majesty. But - \nJOSEPH Yes? \nSALIERI You already commissioned an opera from Mozart. \nJOSEPH And the result satisfies. \nSALIERI Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism. \nJOSEPH Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart. \nSALIERI I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes. \nJOSEPH You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea. \n", "test1_id": 720, "test2_input": "INT. SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT - 1780'S \nThe music fades. We see Lorl, dressed in a walking cloak, sitting before a desk, talking to someone confidentially. \nLORL They're out every night, sir. Till all hours. \nA hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits. On its finger we see the gold signet ring belonging to Salieri. \nLORL (taking one) Oh, thank you, sir. \nSALIERI Do any pupils come to the house? \nLORL Not that I've seen. \nSALIERI Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all? \nLORL Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat. \nSALIERI Really? What is it he's writing? \nLORL Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir. \nSALIERI Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you? \nConfused, the girl hesitates. He hands her a pile of coins. \nLORL Oh, thank you, sir! \nShe accepts them, delighted. \nEXT. MOZART'S HOUSE - VIENNA STREET - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nThe final movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto in E-flat (K. 482) begins. To its lively music, the door of the house bursts open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street. Following them immediately appear Wolfgang, Constanze and Leopold, all three dressed for an occasion. They climb into a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte-piano. As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight. Then she shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AN ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - VIENNA - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nAn outdoor concert is being given. Mozart is actually playing the final movement of his E-flat concerto with an orchestra. Listening to him is a sizable audience, including the Emperor, flanked by Strack and Von Swieten. \nThe crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood: it is a delightful open-air scene. We hear the gayest and most complex passage. Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays his own work brilliantly. We stay with this scene for a little while and then \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VIENNA STREET - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nA carriage clopping through the streets. Lorl is sitting up on the box beside the driver. Inside the vehicle, we glimpse the figure of Salieri. \nEXT. AN ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - VIENNA - 1780'S \nWe hear more of the concerto. Perhaps the slow interlude in the last movement of K. 482. Mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood. Abruptly we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOZART' S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nLorl is opening the door admitting Salieri. They go in. The door shuts. \nINT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nThe room is considerably tidier as a result of Lorl's ministrations. Salieri stands looking about him with tremendous curiosity. \nLORL I think I've found out about the money, sir. \nSALIERI Yes what? \nShe opens a drawer in a sideboard. Inside we see one gold snuff box: it is the one we saw Mozart being presented with as a child in the Vatican. \nLORL He kept seven snuff boxes in here. I could swear they were all gold. And now look there's only one left. And inside, sir, look - I counted them - tickets from the pawnshop. Six of them. \nSalieri turns to look around him. \nSALIERI Where does he work? \nLORL In there, sir. \nShe points across the room to the workroom. Salieri crosses and goes in alone. \nINT. MOZART'S WORKROOM - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nSalieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus. He is immensely excited. He moves slowly into the 'holy of holies' picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball; a discarded wig; a sock; a buckle - then objects more important to him. Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather. He touches the inkstand. He lays a finger on the candlestick with its half-expired candle. He touches each object as if it were the memento of a beloved. He is in awe. Finally his eye falls on the sheets of music themselves. Stealthily he picks them up. \nCU, The pages. \nWe see words set to music. Against each line of notes is the name of a character: Contessa, Susanna, Cherubino. Then another page - the title page - written in Mozart's hand. \nLe Nozze di Figaro Comedia per musica tratta dal Francese in quattro atti. \nCU, The word Figaro. \nCU, Salieri. He stares amazed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - VIENNA - AFTERNOON - 1780'S \nMozart is playing the cadenza and coda of Piano Concerto (K. 482). He completes the work with a flourish. There is loud applause. The Emperor rises and all follow suit. Mozart comes down to be greeted by him. \nJOSEPH Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man. \nMOZART Thank you, Sire! \nVON SWIETEN Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine. \nMOZART Baron! \nHe sees his wife and father standing by in the crowd. Leopold is signaling insistently. \nMOZART Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour? \nJOSEPH What is it? \n", "test2_true": "JOSEPH Ah! By all means. \nLeopold comes forward eagerly and fawningly kisses the royal hand. \nLEOPOLD Your Majesty. \nConstanze curtsies. \nJOSEPH Good evening. (to Leopold) We have met before, Herr Mozart. \nLEOPOLD That's right, Your Majesty. Twenty years ago. No, twenty-two! twenty- three! And I remember word for word what you said to me. You said - you said -- \nHe searches his memory. \nJOSEPH Bravo? \nLEOPOLD No! Yes, 'bravo,' of course 'bravo'! Everybody always says 'bravo' when Wolfi plays. Like the King of England. When we played for the King of England, he got up at the end and said, 'Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!' three times. Three bravo's. And the Pope four! Four bravo's from the Holy Father, and one 'bellissimo.' \nAll the courtiers around are looking at him. \nMOZART Father - \nLEOPOLD Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.' \nJOSEPH Ah-ha. Well. There it is. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ORSINI-ROSENBERG'S STUDY - DAY - 1780'S \nThe Director sits at his table with Salieri and Bonno. \nSALIERI I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Yes? \nSALIERI Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Italian? \nBONNO Aie! \nSALIERI And that's not all. He has chosen for his subject, Figaro. The Marriage of Figaro. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG You mean that play? \nSALIERI Exactly. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG He's setting that play to music? \nSALIERI Yes. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG You must be mad. \nBONNO What is this Marriage of Figaro? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG It's a French play, Kapellmeister. It has been banned by the Emperor. \nBONNO Hah! \nHe crosses himself, wide-eyed with alarm. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Are you absolutely sure? \nSALIERI I've seen the manuscript. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Where? \nSALIERI Never mind. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN VON STRACK'S STUDY - DAY - 1780'S \nVON STRACK I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France. \nVON STRACK Oh yes, yes. And that was? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor. \nVON STRACK Ah. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE EMPEROR'S STUDY - DAY - 1780'S \nThe Emperor stands in the middle of the room in close conversation with Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Von Swieten, and Bonno. Salieri is not present. A door opens and a lackey announces: \nLACKEY Herr Mozart. \nThey all turn. Mozart approaches, rather apprehensively, and kisses Joseph's hand. \nJOSEPH Sit down, gentlemen, please. \nThey all sit, save Mozart. The room suddenly looks like a tribunal. Joseph is in a serious mood. \nJOSEPH Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre? \nMOZART Yes, Sire. \nJOSEPH Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true? \nMOZART Who told you this, Majesty? \nJOSEPH It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true? \nMOZART Well, yes, I admit it is. \nJOSEPH Would you tell me why? \n", "test2_id": 721, "test3_input": "SALIERI What man? \nThe knocking increases in loudness, terrifying Mozart. \nMOZART Tell him to go away. Tell him I'm still working on it. Don't let him in! \nSalieri moves to the door. \nMOZART Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it. \nSALIERI Finish what? \nMOZART He knows. He knows! \nSalieri leaves the room. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nSalieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal Schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre. He still wears his bird make-up and under his street cloak, his feathered costume is clearly seen. He has with him the three actresses, also looking anxious and also in make-up as the three attendants in The Magic Flute. \nSCHIKANEDER Herr Salieri. \nSALIERI Yes, I am looking after him. \nSCHIKANEDER Can we come in? \nSALIERI Well, he's sleeping now. Better not. \nSCHIKANEDER But he's all right? \nSALIERI Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest. \nSCHIKANEDER Well, tell him we were here, won't you? \nSALIERI Of course. \nSCHIKANEDER And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times. \nSALIERI Bene. \nSCHIKANEDER I'll call tomorrow. \nSALIERI Yes. (to the actresses) And congratulations to all of you. It was superb. \nACTRESSES Thank you! Thank you, Excellency! \nSchikaneder produces a bag of money. \nSCHIKANEDER Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh? \nSALIERI Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly! \nACTRESSES (delighted) Goodnight, Your Excellency. Goodnight! \nThey bob and curtsey. Schikaneder stares at Salieri, uneasily, vaguely suspicious. Salieri smiles back at him and shuts the door. He stays for a moment, thinking. He contemplates the money. \nINT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S \nMozart is sitting up in bed, staring at the door. It opens. Salieri returns. He holds in his hand the bag of money. \nMOZART What happened? \nSalieri pours the coins out of the bag onto the coverlet. \nSALIERI He said to give you this. And if you finish the work by tomorrow night, he will pay you another hundred ducats. \nMozart looks at the coins astonished. \nMOZART Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred? \nSALIERI Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way? \nMOZART Would you? Actually, you could. \nSALIERI My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure. \nMOZART But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed. \nSALIERI Of course. \nMOZART You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write. \nSALIERI Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work? \nMOZART A Mass. A Mass for the Dead. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A SMALL DANCE HALL - BADEN - NIGHT - 1790'S \nTrivial dance music is playing. Constanze is doing a waltz with a young OFFICER in military uniform. At the moment we see her, she stops abruptly, as if in panic. \nOFFICER What is it? \nCONSTANZE I want to go! \nOFFICER Where? \nCONSTANZE I want to go back to Vienna. \nOFFICER Now? \nCONSTANZE Yes! \nOFFICER Why? \nCONSTANZE I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here. \nOFFICER (laying a hand on her arm) What are you talking about? \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "Mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows. The coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of bottles. Salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an improvised worktable. On it are blank sheets of music paper, quills, and ink. Also the score of the Requiem Mass as so far composed. Mozart is bright-eyed with a kind of fever. Salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire to put down the notes as quickly as Mozart can dictate them. \nMOZART Where did I stop? \nSALIERI (consulting the manuscript) The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra. \nMOZART So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that? \nSALIERI Consigned to flames of woe. \nMOZART Do you believe in it? \nSALIERI What? \nMOZART A fire which never dies. Burning one forever? \nSALIERI Oh, yes. \nMOZART Strange! \nSALIERI Come. Let's begin. \nHe takes his pen. \nSALIERI Confutatis Maledictis. \nMOZART We ended in F Major? \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART So now - A minor. Suddenly. \nSalieri writes the key signature. \nMOZART The Fire. \nSALIERI What time? \nMOZART Common time. \nSalieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly and urgently as he can, at Mozart's dictation. He is obviously highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates. His speed, however, can never be too fast for Mozart's impatient mind. \nMOZART Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. (singing the note) Con-fu-ta-tis. (speaking) Second measure, second beat. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis. (speaking) G-sharp, of course. \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART Third measure, second beat starting on E. (singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. (speaking) And fourth measure, fourth beat - D. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis. (speaking) Do you have that? \nSALIERI I think so. \nMOZART Sing it back. \nSalieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line. After the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on the soundtrack and engulfs his voice. They stop. \nMOZART Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. (singing) Con-fu-ta-tis. (speaking) Second measure, fourth beat on D. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis. (speaking) All right? \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART Fourth measure, second beat - F. (singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. \nHis voice is lost on the last words, as tenors engulf it and take over the soundtrack, singing their whole line from the beginning, right to the end of the sixth measure where the basses stopped, but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them. Salieri writes feverishly. We see his pen jotting down the notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page. The music stops again. \nMOZART Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. (He hurriedly hums the opening notes of the bass vocal line) The first bassoon and tenor trombone - \nSALIERI (labouring to keep up) Please! Just one moment. \nMozart glares at him, irritated. His hands move impatiently. Salieri scribbles frantically. \nMOZART It couldn't be simpler. \nSALIERI (finishing) First bassoon and tenor trombone - what? \nMOZART With the tenors. \nSALIERI Also identical? \nMOZART Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant. \nHe again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting. On the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line. We also hear the trumpets and timpani. The sound is bare and grim. It stops at the end of the sixth measure. Salieri stops writing. \nSALIERI And that's all? \nMOZART Oh no. Now for the Fire. (he smiles) Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this. \nHe sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato. \nMOZART (speaking) Second measure on B. \nHe sings the second measure of the ostinato. \nMOZART (speaking) Do you have me? \nSALIERI I think so. \nMOZART Show me. \nSalieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato. \nMOZART (excitedly) Good, good - yes! Put it down. And the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising - C to D to E, up to the dominant chord. Do you see? \nAs Salieri writes, Mozart sings the ostinato from the beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their agitated accompaniment. They stop. \nSALIERI That's wonderful! \nMOZART Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed. \nHe is now sitting bolt upright, hushed and inspired. \nMOZART C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. (singing the alto part) Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis. \nSALIERI Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'? \n", "test3_id": 722}

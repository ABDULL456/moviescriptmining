UNCLE SAM (eyes popping/apoplectic) For fucks SAKE! 
CLOUGH Let me ask you a question, Uncle Sam. What did you come into football for? 
UNCLE SAM To support the football club in MY HOME TOWN. The club I've supported ALL MY LIFE.

62   CON TINUE D:                                                  62 
CLOUGH Well, I'm sure we all admire your loyalty... 
UNCLE SAM What I DIDN'T come into it for was to be lectured by a cocky little twat from the North East. 
CLOUGH But the way I see it, there's no point being in this game unless you want to beat the best, and be the best, and that's all the people of Derby want. To see their team on top of the tree, Derby, Derby Uber Alles, and if it's really their interest you have at heart, not just impressing your friends in the Director's box, I suggest you keep your eyes on your road haulage business, keep your opinions to yourself and start signing some fucking cheques, there's a good lad. Leave the running of this football club to the professionals. 
UNCLE SAM But professionals DON'T run the club, Brian, the Chairman does. And if it's true, that football is all about money, and that's the way it's going, that's suits us Chairmen just fucking fine..because we're the ones who've got it. SAM LONGSON lights a cigar, and walks off. 
63   EXT. CAR PARK - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)                63 
The Leeds coach pulls into the Derby car park. Doors open. DON REVIE and SYD OWEN disembark. 
Followed by the Leeds PLAYERS. Smoking. Side-burns. Long- haired assassins one and all. 
64   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - (1972)                            64 
CLOUGH and TAYLOR watch from an upstairs corridor window.. 
CLOUGH See they've driven all the way into the car park this time.

64   CON TINUE D:                                                  64 
TAYLOR It's not a cup game, is it? 
CLOUGH and TAYLOR look at one another, "Nutter". 
65   INT. DRESSING-ROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)           65 
An atmosphere of expectation and excitement. 
Outside, the sound of the crowd. The sound of tannoy announcements. CLOUGH goes to JOHN MCGOVERN.. 
CLOUGH You know what your job is today? 
MCGOVERN Yes, Boss. Stay in position. Keep the shape. "Stop being the Wandering Jew". CLOUGH Good lad. And enjoy it. You deserve to. You've worked hard this week. 
CLOUGH moves to JOHN O'HARE. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Clear about what you're doing today? 
O'HARE Be big. Be strong. Any chance I get, flatten Paul fucking Madely. 
CLOUGH Good lad. He bullies you, you bully him back. And near post for the corners we worked on. 
O'HARE Yes, Boss. 
CLOUGH moves to another PLAYER. (his new signing, COLIN TODD) 
CLOUGH Understand what I want from you today, son? 
TODD (smiles) I should, Mr. Clough. It's simple enough.

65   CON TINUE D:                                                  65 
CLOUGH Go on, let's hear it. 
TODD "To be Colin fucking Todd, the best technical footballer in the country." 
Laughter in the dressing-room. 
CLOUGH There, how could you forget that? Now come on.. (clapping hands) Up and at `em! 
CLOUGH holds the door open, shaking each and every one of the PLAYERS' hands as they clatter out into the tunnel..

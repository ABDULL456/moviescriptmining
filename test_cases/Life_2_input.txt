Confused, Abernathy looks back and forth between the two men. Then Willie steps forward. 
WILLIE Actually, it was me, boss. I know I may look old... 
BISCUIT Any fool could see that baby's mine, boss. 
COOKIE I beg to differ. That cute little rascal belongs to me... 
POKER FACE I'm the father... 
RADIO I'm the father, boss... 
GOLDMOUTH I'm the father... 
JANGLE LEG I'm the father... 
And so it goes down the line, until every last man of Camp 8 has stepped forward to claim kinship with the Superintendent. Even hard-ass Dillard can't help cracking a smile. Disgusted, confused and thoroughly fed up, Abernathy jams the revolver into his belt and climbs into the car. As he guns the engine, Mae Rose gazes out the back window, smiling one last time at the father of her baby. Can't Get Right smiles back. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY 
It's visiting Sunday and Ray's Boom Boom Room is in full swing. Sylvia's girls are everywhere. Down at the gunline, Dillard takes his cut from inmates lined up for their turn in the tonk. A FIVE-PIECE PRISON BAND is playing the blues. Nearby, Willie is dispensing Ray's moonshine from a bunkhouse window. He raises a jar in a toast. 
WILLIE To Superintendent Abernathy. May he have many more grandchildren! 
The incorrigibles erupt in boisterous agreement. Claude grabs Can't Get Right and shakes him. 
CLAUDE What I want to know is where? When? How? 
WILLIE Wasting your breath, Claude. He ain't the type to kiss and tell. 
Just then, Rev. Clay and his daughter emerge from the mess hall and start across the yard. It's a good thing the old man is blind because he wouldn't want to see how far his flock has strayed. The Reverend inhales deeply as one of Sylvia's girls passes nearby. 
REV. CLAY There's a sweet fragrance in the air today. 
CLAY'S DAUGHTER The magnolias are blooming early this year, daddy. 
Blissed out incorrigibles enjoy a last dance as the band downshifts into a slow, sultry number. In the midst of the dancers, Claude clings to Sylvia. Nearby, Jangle Leg dances intimately with a YOUNG WOMAN. 
Up on the porch, Ray refreshes Biscuit's drink. Biscuit has been crying and it shows. The liquor probably isn't helping. 
RAY Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him. 
BISCUIT Hell with him. It ain't that. 
He pulls some folded sheets of paper from his pocket, passes them to Ray. 
RAY These are free papers. 
BISCUIT (devastated) What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure. 
RAY Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep. 
Poker Face leans in. 
POKER FACE (sotto) I'll give you three to one she gives him the strap. 
Ray gives Poker face a shove, then turns back to Biscuit. 
RAY It's 1945. It's a different world now. 
BISCUIT Not for me, it ain't. 
RAY Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would. 
Ray hands back the papers and heads off to dance with a PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN lingering nearby. Left alone, Biscuit polishes off his moonshine and checks his reflection in the bunkhouse window. 
BISCUIT No life on the inside, no life on the outside... 
He crumples the discharge papers and drops them. Then he steps down from the porch and walks calmly past the dancing prisoners toward the gun line. 
Ray lifts his head off his date's shoulder. Something about the way Biscuit is walking suggests that he isn't going to stop. 
RAY Hey, Biscuit...! 
But it's too late. Biscuit crosses the gun line and keeps walking, his eyes focused on the horizon. 
TRUSTY Man over the line! 
The band stops playing, the dancers grow still. Dillard turns around and squints. 
DILLARD Goddamnit, Biscuit, get back here! 
But Biscuit isn't paying attention. He breaks into a run. Dillard nods to Hoppin' Bob who raises his rifle and draws a bead. But he can't pull the trigger. He lowers his gun.

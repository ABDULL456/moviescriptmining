And they are moving. 
EXT. BACK OF CLOSED STORE - DAY 
Robby and Sharon are hurrying around to the back as we hear more POLICE UNITS CONVERGING in front. 
ANGLE - STREET 
As Catch arrives on the scene and sees Sharon and Robby moving around the building to the back. He is still amazed at the sight of her. He decides to follow her, keeping her in sight, driven. 
ON SHARON, ROBBY 
They are scouting through crates and weeds as a young man is flushed from cover at the back of the store and runs from them. 
ROBBY Freeze! 
The man runs on, and Sharon chases with Robby close behind her. Sharon speaks to her shoulder radio mike as she runs. 
SHARON (to radio) Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect fleeing south on Pico Place, young man, green jacket. No visible weapon... (to Robby) Robby! 
ROBBY Right behind you! (to man) Stop and lie down with your arms... shit. 
The man has jumped a fence.   Sharon follows. 
ROBBY Careful! 
SHARON I see him! 
She goes over the fence, then Robby. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
The man runs and Sharon chases. Robby, not far behind glances off to the side, seeing Catch, still following. 
ROBBY Citizen on your right!   Hey! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
But Sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns suddenly, pointing a handgun! 
ROBBY Gun! 
And Sharon, wide-eyed, is already pulling her weapon, but not in time. The man is aiming at her and about to fire when he is tackled by Catch. 
Catch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of the man's hand, and Sharon is on him in an instant, pointing her gun at him... 
SHARON Freeze!    Right there! 
Catch scrambles to his feet. Robby joins Sharon and puts his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at Catch. So does Sharon. But Catch starts to hurry off. 
ROBBY Hey!     Wait! 
Two other cops (Ray Juliette and SANCHEZ) rush toward the suspect on the ground. 
RAY You got him? 
ROBBY He was armed. 
RAY Jesus. 
ROBBY Citizen took him down. 
RAY No shit!? 
Sharon stares across the lot to where Catch has halted. More cops are converging. Ray Juliette and Sanchez move toward Catch, while a sergeant and others surround Sharon and the suspect. In between the crowd of cops, Catch and Sharon glance at each other, during... 
ON CATCH 
as the cops reach him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RAY What happened here? 
CATCH I... just saw it and... I saw the gun, so... 
ON SHARON 
ROBBY You all right, Pogo? 
She is shaken, speaks softly. 
SHARON I was dead.   Y'know. 
She glances toward Catch. (She doesn't recognize him from the accident.) Their eyes meet briefly, but then their attention is pulled to the others. Sharon speaks to her sergeant. 
SHARON He had me.    I was dead. 
ON CATCH 
He is shaken, too.    Sanchez is taking notes as Ray checks his I.D. 
CATCH I was just walking by.      I live near here. 
Ray nods, handing the I.D. to Sanchez.

BILL KROGSTAD Said it before, I'll say it again: Your job, the office in Brown Valley-- all safe. What you need to worry about is getting down there and representing us the best you can. That's all you need to worry about. 
Tim swallows hard. Bill brings it in for a hug and inhales Tim's hair. 
INT. PLANE - DAY 
Tim has a window seat. He reads the safety card. He's sweaty, anxious. A vaguely swarthy MAN (Indian? Italian? Hard to tell.), 40s, sits next to him. A perky FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT You lucky ducks are obviously seated in an exit row. Score! (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D) Just gotta make sure you're willing and able to assist crew members in the event of an emergency evacuation... 
The man smiles nonchalantly. Tim tries to play it cool. 
TIM You're talking what, water landing? (looks around, whispers) Terror type deal? Terrorists...? 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT It's really just a formality. 
TIM Believe it or not, I have actually never been on an airplane before. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Oh, well you'll do awesome. 
TIM (takes a moment) OK. If you need any help, I'm in. 
The flight attendant smiles politely, if confusedly. 
THE PLANE TAKES OFF 
Tim looks out the window, watching nervously as the dairy farms and frozen lakes of northern Wisconsin recede. He instinctively turns to his neighbor. 
TIM Tim Lippe. 
MAN Ah. David Marinakis. 
They shake hands. 
TIM Great to meet you, Dave. Wondering, what kind of name is Marinakis? 
DAVID MARINAKIS Greek. It's Greek. 
TIM Marinakis. OK. Mine's German. Lippe. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM (CONT'D) As in, "Don't you get lippy with me, mister." My grandma used to say that. Before she passed. Lot of people pronounce it lip. Course the high German's probably more like lipp-uh. 
David Marinakis nods, goes back to his book, seemingly shutting down the conversation. Tim settles in. 
THE PLANE LANDS -- 
Tim hesitates before stepping onto the jetway-- one small step for man-- and just like that, he's in IOWA! 
INT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT, BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY 
Tim helps David Marinakis take his bag off the carousel. 
TIM Like I say, Dave, it's not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance. 
DAVID MARINAKIS It's a good way of looking at it. 
TIM I think so. 
Tim hands David his card, who takes it with a genuine smile. 
TIM (CONT'D) Let me know how things go with your Alltel deal, Dave. E-mail me. 
DAVID MARINAKIS Will do, Tim. Thanks. 
David exits. Tim stands there waving. 
EXT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE - DAY 
Tim emerges from an elevator on the roof of a parking garage. He inhales the chilly Iowa air. He glances at his rental agreement and spots his car, a red Chevy Cobalt. 
TIM Hello. Score! 
As he approaches the car, he stops. He chuckles, in awe. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM (CONT'D) Holy crap. Awesome. 
In the distance, the Cedar Rapids skyline looms-- its tallest building, the Alliant Tower stretching 21 stories into the cloudy sky. Tim snaps a photo with his cell phone.

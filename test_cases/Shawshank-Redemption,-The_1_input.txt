Norton and Hadley stride across the grounds, ALARM BLARING. 
NORTON I want every man on that cellblock questioned! Start with that friend of his! 
HADLEY who? 
219	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 219 
Red watches as Norton storms up with an entourage of guards. 
NORTON Him. 
Red's eyes widen. Guards yank him from his cell. 
220	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 220 
Norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up into a fine rage: 
NORTON What do you mean "he just wasn't here?" Don't say that to me, Haig! Don't say that to me again! 
HAIG But sir! He wasn't! He isn't! 
NORTON I can see that, Haig! You think I'm blind? Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig? 
HAIG No sir! 
Norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley. 
NORTON What about you? You blind? Tell me what this is! 
HADLEY Last night's count. 
NORTON You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! Right there, see? "Dufresne." He was in his cell at lights out! Stands to reason he'd still be here this morning! I want him found! Not tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now! 
Haig scurries out, gathering men. Norton spins to Red. 
NORTON Well? 
RED Well what? 
NORTON I see you two all the time, you're thick as thieves, you are! He must'a said something! 
RED No sir, he didn't! 
Norton spreads his arms evangelist-style, spins slowly around. 
NORTON Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind! Nothin' left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake on the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she knows! What say there, Fuzzy- Britches? Feel like talking? Guess not. Why should you be different? 
Red exchanges looks with the guards. Even they're nervous. Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. He hurls them at the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words: 
NORTON It's a conspiracy! (SMASH) That's what this is! (SMASH) It's one big damn conspiracy! (SMASH) And everyone's in on it! (SMASH) Including her! 
He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel. No smash. 
It takes a moment for this to sink in. All eyes go to her. The rock went through her. There's a small hole in the poster where her navel used to be. 
You could hear a pin drop. Norton reaches up, sinks his finger into the hole. He keeps pushing...and his entire hand disappears into the wall. 
221 	ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 221 
as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes. Stunned faces peer in. CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK...to reveal the long crumbling tunnel in the wall. 
222	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 222 
RORY TREMONT, a guard barely out of his teens, tries not to look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest. He's getting instructions from six different people at once. 
RED (V.O.) They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't much in the brains department, but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job... (they slap a flashlight in his hands) ...he was willing to go. 
223	INT -- TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 223 
Rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly. 
RED (V.O.) Probably thought he'd win a Bronze Star or something. 
224	INT -- VERTICAL SHAFT -- DAY (1966) 224 
Dark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. Rory's appears, shining his flashlight down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS. 
RED (V.O.) It was his third day on the job. 
RORY Warden? There's a space here between the walls 'bout three feet across! Smells pretty damn bad! 
NORTON (O.S.) I don't care what it smells like! 
HADLEY (O.S.) Go on, boy! We got a hold of you!

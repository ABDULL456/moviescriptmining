{"train": "She coyly leans INTO FRAME. \nO'NEILL (O.S.) (continuing) A-huh. A little more... good! \nShe is totally blocking her baby out of the picture. \nO'NEILL \nHe gets out from behind the camera. \nO'NEILL I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons? \nWOMAN (seductively) Of course. \nShe starts to unbutton her blouse. O'Neill looks into his camera. \nO'NEILL'S POV THROUGH LENS \nWe SEE the Woman finish her last button. \nO'NEILL (O.S.) Now lean in a little more... more... more... \nAs she complies, her breasts all but spill out of her dress. \nO'NEILL (O.S.) (continuing) Hold that pose. \nO'NEILL \nHe runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman. \nTHROUGH CAMERA LENS \nWe SEE a QUICK SERIES of camera flashes. Each pose finds him near her breasts. He has them on his head. He's cheek to breast. Etc. \nRICK \nenters and witnesses the photo session. He immediately jumps into the shots. \nTHROUGH CAMERA LENS \nRick joins the craziness. After several beats, the Woman gets bored and EXITS the FRAME. \nTHE WOMAN \nAs Rick and O'Neill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds in a photo booth, the Woman takes her child and exits. A few beats pass and the guys notice they're alone. \nO'NEILL Where'd she go? \nRICK She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce. \nO'Neill crosses to his camera and takes out the film. \nO'NEILL Okay... be right with ya. \nRICK \nHe picks up some photographs of today's work. \nINSERT - PHOTOS \nEach one has a different mother in several seductive poses. Their babies are barely visible, if at all. \nRICK (O.S.) Pictures a family will cherish forever. \nEXT. CHULO'S AUTO SHOP - DAY \nRick's school bus pulls into the yard of the auto shop. Several Chicanos are working on various cars. Rick and O'Neill hop out. \nRICK Hey, Chulo, where are you, man? \nANGLE - LATE-MODEL CAR \nWe SEE a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under the chassis. Slowly, a large, bear-like body rolls out and we catch our first glimpse of CHULO. A happy-go-lucky mechanic of Mexican ancestry. \nCHULO Hey, you guys, what's going on? \nRICK We're going for a little liquid refreshment. \nCHULO Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you? \nA SMALL MECHANIC with an eye patch gets into a car behind them as we DOLLY WITH the guys THROUGH the lot. \nCHULO (continuing) Roberto, you finished fixing that lighter yet? \nAnother MECHANIC sticks his face out of another car and shakes his head. Just then Raul, the eye-patched worker, whizzes by behind the guys, driving the car in a zig-zag pattern right into traffic. \nCHULO (continuing; to Rick) I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion? \nRYKO Whoa... You got to go to school for that or what? \nCUSTOMER (he's had enough) Look, forget the specials. We'll take three hamburgers. \nRYKO Okay, great... Any of you guys got a pencil by any chance? \nOne of the customers shrugs and hands him a pen. \nRYKO (impressed) All right, a Bic... How 'bout a piece of paper? \nRyko's customers look totally disgusted as Ryko's short attention span is interrupted by something he sees O.S. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRick and the guys appear in the bar. \nRICK Ryko. Come on! \nThey all disappear into the bar area. \nRYKO Be right there. (to customers) Nice rappin' with you guys. Unfortunately I'm outta here. Someone else will have to help you. (calling off) Skip! \nThe customers are pleased to get rid of Ryko. SKIP enters. He's a clone of Ryko. \nSKIP Like um... What's the deal, you guys gonna order? \nThe customers give each other a \"Here we go again\" look \nANGLE - THE GUYS \nThey're laughing uproariously and carrying on as Ryko comes over and sits down. \nRYKO Hi pals. \nThe guys acknowledge him. \nGARY Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement? \nANGLE - RICK \nRICK All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is. \nCHULO Man, you're losing your audience. \nRICK Okay... This is it... I'm getting married. \nO'NEILL What? \nCHULO You're kidding. \nGARY I don't believe it. \nRYKO Fuck me! \nRICK Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro. \nCHULO Hey, man, congratulations! \nChulo gets up and gives Rick a big bear hug... The other guys shake his hand. \nGARY Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married? \nRICK Because I love her. What can I tell you? \nRYKO You sure? This means no more partying. \nRICK No more raping and pillaging, either. You'll have to carry on without me. \nGARY Next Saturday... That's just two more weeks to live. \nO'NEILL Hold it... As long as you're gonna go through with this, the least we can do is make sure you go out in style. \nCHULO (warming to this) Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads. \nO'NEILL Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living. \nRICK Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will. \nGARY Let's have a toast. \nThe guys all raise their glasses. \nO'NEILL To Rick. \nGARY To us. \nCHULO To girls with big pairs. \nRICK It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished. \nDEBBIE (looking at the stove) I think your dinner's burning. \nRick crosses to the stove. A small fire is coming out of one of the frying pans. He douses it with water. \nRICK Don't worry... it's supposed to do this. \nDEBBIE (setting the table) Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun. \nRICK Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me. \nDEBBIE You're going to have a bachelor party? \nRICK Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. (he brings all the food to the table) Well, what do you think? \nDEBBIE It looks awful. \nRICK Yes, but looks are deceiving... (takes a bite) Not in this case, however. \nDEBBIE Are you going to have women at your party? \nRICK No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home. \nDEBBIE I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers. \nRICK Oh, those. Why do you ask? \nDEBBIE Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy. \nRick grabs her; starts kissing her passionately on the neck. \nRICK Deb, you is my woman now. I is yo man. No painted lady ever gonna come between us. \nDEB I need you to promise. \nRICK Okay, you got it. I got a way we can seal the deal -- what'd you say? \nHe grabs her. They kiss and slide down onto the table, knocking the dishes to the floor. \nEXT. BEL AIR-TYPE ESTATE - DAY \nThrough the iron gates of an impressive-looking estate comes Debbie in her convertible VW Rabbit. She pulls up behind a new Porsche 911 and a Jeep, all decked out with rifles, nets and other hunting equipment. As she walks down the path toward the house, she sees something off in the distance that startles her. \nDEBBIE'S POV \nA large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side door of the house. \nANGLE - DEBBIE \nDEBBIE (calling O.S.) Cole?... Cole! \nDEBBIE'S POV \nThe \"Bear\" turns around. We SEE that the bear is, in fact, dead. It is being carried by a tall, handsome HUNTER. He waves to Debbie and indicates for her to follow him inside. \nINT. COLE'S SMOKEHOUSE - DAY \nDebbie opens a rustic-looking door and peers in. \nDEBBIE Cole? \nCOLE (O.S.) Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse. \nCAMERA PANS WITH Debbie as she enters the room. She passes several trophies, guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from the wall. She makes her way past some sections of an undetermined animal's anatomy hanging from hooks suspended from the ceiling. Finally we see COLE WHITTIER, a Steve Garvey look-alike... rugged all-American, and heir to the Whittier Plastic Wrap fortune. Despite his jockish good looks and outward arrogance, there's something in his manner that is definitely unsavory. \nAs Debbie approaches him we SEE that he is butchering some unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of him. (NOTE: For the squeamish, all of this is done OUT OF FRAME. The only thing we should HEAR are the delightful SOUNDS of TAXIDERMY.) \nCOLE Hi, Deb. Just got back from the mountains. (as he cuts in with a surgeon's skill) Isn't this a beauty?... It's gonna look great in the den. \nDebbie tries her best not to look down at what he's doing. \nDEBBIE Cole, we've got to talk. \nCOLE Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh? \nDEBBIE No, Cole, I... \nCOLE (lifting an organ of some sort O.S.) It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas. \nDEBBIE Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you... \nCOLE You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough... \nDEBBIE Cole, I'm marrying Rick. \nCOLE (confused) You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me? \nRick starts humming the \"ABC Wide World of Sports\" theme loudly. Mr. T. gives him a disgusted look and serves the ball. Rick smashes the ball and sends it over the fence, out of the court. \nEXT. THE THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' BACKYARD - DAY \nA middle-aged COUPLE are sitting on some lawn furniture trying to read the newspaper. A tennis ball comes down from the sky and hits the guy squarely on the top of the head. PULL OUT to REVEAL that they're surrounded by dozens of tennis balls. \nMAN One of these days I'm gonna burn Thomerson's court to the ground. \nEXT. THE THOMERSON'S - MEDIUM SHOT - DAY \nRick and Mr. Thomerson are having a heart to heart chat over some lemonade in front of the tennis court. \nRICK Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience. \nMR. THOMERSON Rick, I want to cut through the b.s. \nRICK I'd love that. \nMR. THOMERSON (sitting on his anger) Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes. \nRICK Mr. Thomerson, I... \nMR. THOMERSON Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions... \nRICK Feel free. \nMR. THOMERSON First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life... \nAs Mr. Thomerson drones on, Rick shifts uncomfortably in his chair, focusing his attention on Debbie, her mother and her older, cynical cousin, ILENE, who are sitting nearby on the rear patio. \nANGLE - DEBBIE, MRS. THOMERSON AND ILENE \nMRS. THOMERSON I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year. \nDEBBIE Great, Mom. \nILENE If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party. \nDEBBIE Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick. \nILENE Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble? \nDEBBIE Ilene, Rick promised... \nILENE Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs. \nMRS. THOMERSON (trying to change the subject) Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. (calling to Mr. T) Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade? \nANGLE - MR. THOMERSON AND RICK \nMR. THOMERSON In a second... (to Rick) And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words. \nRICK Well, sir, that's quite a list. But you're absolutely right. And if I work hard at it, I think I can be a totally changed person by the time we finish lunch... \nMr. Thomerson rolls his eyes, knowing he's been wasting his breath. He grabs the pitcher of lemonade and Rick grabs the tray, which is filled with fresh lemons. They get up at the same time and collide, sending the lemonade all over Mr. T., and the lemons bounding over the fence. \nEXT. THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' HOUSE \nThe Neighbor we saw before is reading his paper when an avalanche of lemons comes flying at him, joining the tennis balls on the lawn. \nNEIGHBOR I hate those people... I really do. \nINT. THOMERSON HOUSE - DAY \nThe Thomersons, Rick, Debbie and Ilene are just finishing lunch. The DOORBELL RINGS. Mr. Thomerson gets up to answer it. Standing there is Cole, wearing his tennis shorts. \nCOLE Hi, everybody. Am I late? \nMR. THOMERSON Not at all. We're just finishing lunch. \nCole crosses to the table and kisses Mrs. T's hand gallantly. \nCOLE Good to see you, Mrs. Thomerson. Hello, Debbie. \nHe turns to Rick. \nCOLE (continuing) And... \nRICK Bond... James Bond. \nCole gives him a quick look of contempt and exits with Mr. T. \nMR. THOMERSON (O.S.) So, Cole, you been practicing your game? \nCOLE (O.S.) Sure have... \nDEBBIE Why is Cole here? \nCOLE Seventy-five hundred. \nRICK Not interested. \nCOLE Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart... \nRICK I'm marrying Debbie. \nCOLE Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools... \nRICK (to O'Neill) What is this person's story here? \nO'NEILL The way I see it, the big lug is in love and he's got a lot of major appliances lying around. \nDebbie and Mr. T. have joined Rick. \nDEBBIE Cole, what are you doing here? \nMR. THOMERSON He's just trying to save you from making a mistake. (to Rick) A big mistake. \nRICK Thanks, Dad. (to Cole) Cole, go away. \nCOLE He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would. \nRICK Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now. \nCole turns red with anger. \nCOLE (pissed) Rick, me and you aren't through yet. \nHe runs off. \nRICK (a la talk show host) Ladies and gentlemen, Cole Whittier. Let's hear it for him -- a funny, funny guy. We love ya, babe. \nThe wind suddenly picks up. A storm is coming in off the sea. Father Falwell's cassock blows up again. It starts to rain and hail. Everyone runs for cover but Rick and O'Neill. \nRICK (to O'Neill) You think the gods are telling me something? \nINT. RICK AND DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRick is snuggled cozily on his side of the bed, fast asleep. Debbie is staring anxiously at the ceiling. After a couple of beats, she tugs at Rick's shoulder. \nRICK (drowsy) Huh? Wha... \nDEBBIE I can't sleep. \nRICK Oh... I got something for that. \nHe groggily reaches into the nightstand, pulls out a hammer. He raises it as if to hit Debbie over the head. \nDEBBIE Stop fooling around... I need to talk. \nRICK What's the matter? \nDEBBIE I don't know... I just feel scared. \nRICK (he sits up) About what? \nDEBBIE The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party... \nRICK I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right. \nDEBBIE Before or After I have my nervous breakfown? \nRICK C'mere. \nHe starts to gently rub her shoulders. She breathes deeply, trying to let go. \nDEBBIE That feels so great. \nRICK Good... \nDEBBIE Um... that's very relaxing. \nRICK Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland. \nHe slowly lowers her to her pillow and tucks the covers in around her. \nRICK (continuing) Close your eyes... that's it... There's nothing to worry about... I love you... I'm a great guy... (yawning) In two days you're gonna be Mrs. Great Guy. \nHe yawns again and turns off the light on the night table. There is a beat of silence in the dark. We PUSH IN ON their faces, which are faintly illuminated by a street light outside the open window. Both of them have their eyes wide open as they stare at the ceiling in fearful anticipation of the next day. \nINT. AIRPORT - DAY \nThe guys (except Gary) are walking through the busy airport. \nRYKO You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together? \nRICK Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness. \nDEBBIE You better not have too much joy. \nRICK Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow... (starts singing) We're going to the chapel and we're... \nDEBBIE (singing) Gonna get married... \nANGLE - THE GUYS \nThey start to join in the song in a little less than perfect harmony. \nEVERYBODY Going to the chapel and we're gonna get married. \nDEBBIE Gee, I really love you... \nRICK And we're gonna get ma-a-a-ried. \nEVERYBODY (whooping it up) Going to the chapel of love. \nRICK Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah. \nEXT. BUS \nThe bus zooms down the street. \nEVERYBODY (V.O.) Going to the chapel of love. \nEXT. THOMERSON'S - DUSK \nRick's bus comes up to the driveway in front of the house and stops. \nINT. RICK'S BUS - DUSK \nRICK This is it, lady. Last stop. \nDEBBIE Can't I just go with you guys? \nRICK Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady. \nHe opens the door, picks Debbie up and carries her out to the sidewalk. \nDEBBIE Remember, you promised... no screwing around. \nRICK Did I promise that? I don't remember that... \nDEBBIE You're really pissing me off. \nShe grabs Rick and wraps her arm around him in a playful headlock. \nRICK Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave. \nDEBBIE Your mother's not dead. \nRICK Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her. \nDebbie lets go of his neck. \nDEBBIE Have a good time. Don't make it too late. \nRICK Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap. \nDEBBIE I love you. \nThey kiss, and the guys whistle in the background. Then Debbie starts toward the house and Rick hops back into the bus. He gets into the seat and sits there for a moment, watching Debbie with a guilty look as she goes into the house. \nO'NEILL (to Rick) What's the matter? \nRICK (snapping out of it) Nothing... Let's get crazy! \nRYKO All right! \nCHULO When do the girls get to the party? \nO'NEILL Don't worry, Gary's taking care of that now. \nThe guys holler and whoop it up as Rick puts the bus in gear and takes off down the street. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GRIMY STREET CORNER - EVENING \nJUMBO, a well-dressed behemoth in a sky blue suit and widebrimmed hat, is standing on a street corner talking to Gary. \nGARY So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop. \nJUMBO Let's see your bread. \nMARGOT We're here. \nMRS. THOMERSON How nice. \nTINA I'm Tina Stahl. \nMRS. THOMERSON Of course. Stan's wife... Everyone come in. \nREVERSE ANGLE - THE STREET \nCole sits in his car and watches happily as the hookers go inside. \nINT. THOMERSON'S LIVING ROOM \nDebbie spots Tina. She is oblivious to the two hookers. \nDEBBIE Tina! \nThey give each other a big hug. The hookers watch closely. Debbie leads Tina to the other women. \nDEBBIE (continuing) You know everyone here, don't you? \nTINA Yes. \nThe girls hug and give big hellos. Meanwhile, Margot and Darlene have come to the conclusion they've been hired for a kinky scene. \nMARGOT One of these, huh? \nDARLENE Looks that way. \nMARGOT Buck's a buck. \nThey start to unbutton their coats. \nTina hands Debbie her present. \nDEBBIE It's so heavy. \nShe sits and the girls gather around as she starts to open the gift. \nPhoebe happens to look off and is stunned by what she sees. The others are curious at what she is looking at and they too stare O.S., stunned to silence. \nMARGOT AND DARLENE \ndressed in leather and mesh stockings. Margot carries a whip. Darlene is holding a phallic electrical device. \nDARLENE (business-like) Is there an empty outlet in here? \nDebbie unconsciously points to a nearby wall. Margot and Darlene stand amidst the girls. Darlene plugs in her device. She and Margot start to embrace and fondle one another. The girls watch in stony silence. Dumbfounded at what they see. Margot and Darlene start to sink to the floor, OUT OF OUR SIGHT. Before they disappear, we see Margot take out her gum and park it on an end table. Now OUT OF SIGHT, the girls watch for a beat. Then we hear the WHIRRING of Darlene's implement. Our girls screech in horror and hold onto one another in a protective clump. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nThe guys are sitting around drinking, eating and looking generally bored. Chulo sits in front of the TV, glumly watching an old \"I Love Lucy\" re-run. \nCHULO If I was Ricky Ricardo I would beat the shit out of that chick. \nLARRY (totally ripped, staring at the black and white image) Wow! The colors are sooo beautiful. \nChulo gives him a strange look. \nRYKO (opening a beer, reading the label) Isn't there any beer that's not imported? All this stuff's from St. Louis. \nRICK (calling to imaginary person O.S.) Bartender, round of brains for my friend here. \nGary enters the room. He's all smiles. Confident he's done a great job arranging for the entertainment. \nGARY How's it going, guys? \nEveryone crowds around him like children greeting Daddy. Looking for candy hidden in his coat. \nEVERYONE Where's the girls? Where's the girls? \nRick pushes them away from Gary like a referee separating two fighters. \nRICK Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner. \nGARY What's going on? \nCHULO Nothing. We got no women. \nGARY Screw you. \nRICK It's true. \nGARY This place should have been wall to wall tits by now. \nRICK (to O'Neill) Guy paints a beautiful picture. \nCOLE I got the car only two months ago -- it's got -- \nAs he looks out the window we see with him that his car is gone. \nCOLE (continuing) Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone! \nRICK Maybe it had something to do. \nCOLE Shit! \nHe charges out of the room. \nO'NEILL Odd. He's only been gone a few seconds and I already miss him. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT \nGary spots Jumbo on the same grimy street corner. He's pimping for one of his ladies and makes a sale to an anxious young Marine as Gary approaches him. \nGARY Jumbo, where the hell are the women? \nJUMBO What are you talking about, asshole? \nGARY Your whores never showed up. \nJUMBO They left an hour ago, pink nuts. \nGARY Screw you! \nJumbo has had enough. He backs Gary against a wall and pulls a knife on him. \nJUMBO (irritated; a lot) That's it, prick lips. \nGARY What are you... \nJUMBO I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got? \nGARY Why? \nJUMBO Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash. \nGary hurriedly digs into his pockets and gives Jumbo his money. \nGARY This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere. \nJUMBO (mock sincerity) Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls. \nHe snaps his fingers and TWO of his LADIES come forward. \nJUMBO (continuing; to girls) Give him the works. \nGARY That's more like it. \nThe girls walk over to Gary and proceed to beat the crap out of him. \nEXT. CHIPPENDALE'S - NIGHT \nIt is a garish nightclub. A large lighted billboard proclaims \"ALL MALE... ALL NUDE.\" Two cars pull into the parking lot. Debbie and all of her shower guests get out. \nDEBBIE Are you sure this is a good idea? \nILENE Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party. \nDEBBIE That doesn't mean it was Rick's party. \nILENE Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men. \nBOBBIE (agreeing) Yeah. \nMRS. THOMERSON (reluctantly) I don't know about this. \nDEBBIE C'mon, Mother, it'll be fun. \nThe girls giggle as they enter the place, with Mrs. Thomerson following reluctantly behind. \nINT. CHIPPENDALE'S - NIGHT \nPHOEBE Look at that guy. What a hunk. \nBOBBIE Check out the other guy's buns. \nTINA Let's sit over here. \nThey head for some empty tables. Debbie notices her mother is still standing transfixed by the MAN on display on stage. Debbie grabs her by the shoulder. \nDEBBIE C'mon, Mom. \nOn the way to the table they pass MICHAEL, the bartender, who looks at them and immediately recognizes Debbie. Finding this interesting, he picks up a phone and dials. \nMR. THOMERSON A real turd. \nEXECUTIVE (at a loss for words) Well... hope she'll be very happy. \nThey exit into ballroom. \nINT. CHIPPENDALE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nAmidst the kitchen activities we SEE Rick, O'Neill, Ryko, Stan, and Michael. \nRICK So will your friend Nick do it? \nMICHAEL He'll do anything for money. \nRICK I love his attitude. (calling off) They still out there? \nSTAN \nHe's peeking through the kitchen door. We SEE Debbie and the shower girls whooping it up at a ringside table. Stan turns back to Rick. \nSTAN Breathing heavy at ringside. \nHe joins the other guys. \nRICK (a la Long John Silver) So, they want action, eh? Are you with me, me hardies? \nThe guys shout approval as NICK, one of the male dancers, enters carrying a tray of food. Nick is a muscled hunk. \nMICHAEL Guys, this is Chippendale's star attraction, Nicholas Carter... better known as Nick the Dick. \nRYKO Nick the what? \nNick drops his pants. Since he's being SHOT only from the WAIST UP, we can't see what the guys see. \nNICK (proudly) The Dick. \nALL OUR GUYS (astonished at this O.S. sight) Jesus Christ! \nRICK Let's get this thing going. Tray, please. \nNick holds the tray waist high. Rick arranges the food. \nRICK (continuing) Looks good. Can I have the bun, Michael? \nMichael hands Rick a hot dog bun. Rick places it on the tray. He turns to Nick. \nRICK (continuing) And now, Nick... or is it Mr. Dick? \nNICK Nick. \nRICK Nick, if you would be so kind... \nNICK \nHe holds the tray with one hand. With the other he reaches OUT OF FRAME. In a nutshell, what he does is place his honker in the hot dog bun. As he slaps his business into the bun, we HEAR a solid THUMP. \nRICK Nick, the rest is all yours. \nNICK (excusing himself) Gentlemen. \nHe exits. As he does, our guys crowd around and peek through the kitchen door. \nNICK \nWe FOLLOW him as he approaches the girls' table. \nNICK If you ladies would like to serve yourselves... \nThe girls grab their orders. Mrs. T. is last. Hers is the hot dog. She points to it. \nMRS. THOMERSON Is this the foot long? \nNICK And then some. \nMrs. T. grabs the hot dog. It won't come off the tray. She yanks harder. Nick drops the tray and Mrs. T. finally comes to realize what she is pulling on. She screams in terror. Because of sheer fright, she can't seem to drop Nick's schlong from her grip. The rest of our ladies look to see Mrs. T. 's hot dog. They scream in shock. Debbie spits out her marguerita, hitting Phoebe in the face. \nOUR GUYS \nThey are busting a gut watching the girls' reactions. \nILENE She looks up just in time to see the guys close the kitchen door. \nMRS. T \nstill frozen in a state of shock. The girls try to pry her hands off. \nEXT. STREET CORNER \nRICK Really? \nLARRY Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party. \nLarry gets up and exits the room. PUSH IN ON Rick. He looks after Larry, concerned. \nRICK (to himself) He ain't all right. \nANGLE - THE LOBBY \nCole sits in a phone booth holding the receiver impatiently. \nANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL THE ADJOINING PHONE BOOTH \nThe receiver is off the hook. After a beat, Mr. T. crosses to the phone. Cole does not see him, and vice versa. \nMR. T Hello? \nCOLE Mr. Thomerson. \nMR. T Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is? \nCOLE Yes I did. \nMR. T Fine. How's everything going? \nCOLE Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere... \nMR. THOMERSON So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. (yelling) Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me? \nCOLE What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you. \nLooking over into the next booth, he sees Thomerson's back. \nCOLE (continuing) Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise. \nMR. THOMERSON Well, tell the asshole to shut up. \nCOLE Right. (calling off) Hey, shut up. Okay, sir. \nMR. THOMERSON Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling... (yelling O.S.) Shut up, I'm talking here. (into phone) Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage. \nHe slams the phone down and EXITS SCREEN RIGHT. Cole starts to exit left when he spots Chulo getting into the elevator. \nCHULO Hey, man, your car's looking good. \nCOLE (crazed) Where is it? \nCHULO Out front. \nThe elevator doors slam shut. Cole races out into the street. \nEXT. HOTEL \nCole comes bursting out into the street. We can tell by his shocked expression he doesn't like what he sees. \nCOLE Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. \nCAMERA PANS as he charges to his Porsche. His pride and joy has now, thanks to Chulo, been customized into a Chicano special. It's chopped and channeled; dingleberries rim the back window, flames have been painted on the rear fender; a chain steering wheel, fuzzy dashboard, dice hanging from the mirror. A real East L.A. beauty. \nANGLE - COLE \nHe's snapped -- totally flipped. He turns and yells up to the hotel: \nCOLE (screaming) Rick... Rick... Goddamn it. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - ANGLE - RICK \nHe's standing near the window. \nRICK Gee. I think that's for me. \nHe looks out the window and sees Cole standing next to his transformed Porsche. \nCOLE Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be. \nRICK (yelling back) Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy? \nCOLE (furious) You've had it. I'm gonna get you. \nANGLE - THE STREET \nCole hops in his car and drives off, blowing his HORN at oncoming traffic. The HORN PLAYS \"LA CUCURACHA.\" Cole slams his fist on the steering wheel in disgust. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nRICK (to guys) Don't you love it when old friends stop by? \nUNDER THE TABLE \nThe Hooker grabs the money. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRICK I think you'll enjoy this table. \nO'NEILL So long, Father. \nHe and Rick, suppressing a laugh, exit. Father Falwell picks up the menu. We HEAR the ZIP SOUND. Father perks up. He doesn't know what the hell is happening. \nO'Neill turns to Rick as they're leaving the coffee shop. \nO'NEILL I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now? \nRICK I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nRick and O'Neill enter the suite. No one is there. \nRICK Where the hell is everybody? \nEveryone jumps out from their hiding places. With our guys is Gary and his team of FIVE PROSTITUTES. \nGARY Surprise! (gesturing to the girls) The team bus just pulled in. \nSTAN Hookers. It's a party! \nRICK All right! \nOne of our hookers, KELLEY, gets everyone's attention. \nKELLEY Who's first, guys? \nEveryone acts as if they're in grade school. They raise their hands; they come on like kids trying to get the teacher's attention. \nGUYS Oh, me... me... me! \nO'NEILL Wait. The guest of honor should be first. \nRICK Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break. \nSTAN Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first. \nO'NEILL A moving plea. Okay, Doc, you lead off. I'll screw clean up. \nEveryone cheers Stan's good fortune. Kelley takes Stan by the hand and leads him into the bedroom. Gary turns on a record and everyone starts dancing. Larry is laying out drugs on a table. They consist of lines of coke and various happy time pills of all colors and shapes. Rick takes a look at the layout. \nRICK How thoughtful. A drug smorgasbord. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nChulo enters. He sees the party has taken off. \nCHULO I have returned! \nHe spots a sweet-faced young hooker, LAVERNE. She is prancing around in her bra and underwear. Chulo wants her. \nCHULO (continuing; points to her) You! Mine! \nLaverne is frightened of Chulo. Mainly because he's coming at her like a sex-starved buffalo. Chulo goes after her. Scared, she runs around the room, then out the door. Chulo gives chase. \nRICK (to O'Neill) Chulo's got such a nice, light touch with women. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR \nLaverne runs down the hall, closely pursued by Chulo. An all- female NEW WAVE BAND comes to the door. O'Neill greets them. \nO'NEILL Terrific. You made it... You can set up over there... \nAs they enter we go to -- \nINT. CORRIDOR \nChulo is on the heels of Laverne. She bursts through a door to excape him. \nINT. STAGE \nLaverne finds herself on the stage of a beauty pageant, still in her bra and panties. FIVE other LADIES are dressed in their bathing suits. Chulo stops short of running on stage. Laverne, seeking the safety of the moment, stands in line with the contestants. \nANGLE ON MR. THOMERSON AND OTHER JUDGES \nThey like what they see. \nMR. THOMERSON (to another) Great bathing suit. \nThere is a pained, tragic and extremely stoned out look on his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage. WIDEN as he looks down at his right wrist. \nHe heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor INTO FRAME. He turns it on and runs it over his wrist. Of course, nothing happens. Just then Rick enters. \nRICK What the hell are you doing? \nLARRY I'm trying to slash my wrists. \nRICK You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor? \nLARRY I couldn't find any razor blades. \nRICK Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up. \nLARRY (suddenly laughs like a crazy man) Ha, ha, ha. \nRICK No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party. \nAs he shoves Larry out, Gary enters the bathroom. His expression tells us he's had the best sex of his life. \nRICK Gary, how we doing, big stallion? \nGARY Rick, I really think I'm in love. \nRICK This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on. \nRick exits as Gary dreamily crosses to the mirror. \nGARY (into mirror) This time it's real. She's wonderful. \nGary's \"woman\" enters and closes the door. Their eyes meet. Gary takes her hand and kisses it gently. She turns away, then lifts up the toilet seat, lifts up her dress and proceeds to pee. She is a man. Gary is stunned. His jaw drops open. Gary's dream girl/guy finishes his business. He drops his dress and turns to Gary. \nSHE The name's Tim. I'm always available. \nHe blows a kiss and starts to leave, but turns back. \nSHE/TIM By the way... I also do engine work on BMW's. 'Bye. \nTim exits. Gary feels filthy. He rips open the cabinet, takes out tooth paste and toothbrush and vigorously brushes his teeth. He rips off his clothes and jumps in the shower and scrubs as if he's scraping barnacles off a hull of a tugboat. \nEXT. STABLES - NIGHT \nRyko and Stan drive up to a country stable. They get out of the car and open a barn door. Both are pleased at what they see. \nRYKO All right. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nStanding there is a donkey, eating straw. \nEXT. HOTEL - NIGHT \nCole drives up in his Chulo-customized Porsche. He gets out, then reaches back into the car and takes out a crossbow (the heavy duty metal kind hunters use). He looks up menacingly at the hotel and spots the room where the party is going on. He sees another hotel across the way. He gets an idea and enters the other hotel. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nThe party is going full blast. Some other girls and a couple of guys (hotel guests) enter the room and are quickly swept up in the spirit of the party. O'Neill approaches Rick. \nO'NEILL Rick, I'm concerned. \nRICK About what? \nO'NEILL This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet. \nRICK (trying to joke his way out of it) Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens. \nO'NEILL I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please. \nRICK Oooooo. \nO'NEILL (indicating the bedroom) Right in there, pal. \nRICK If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics. \nO'NEILL That's the old Rick! \nRick enters the bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM \nIt's dark, but for a lamp on the nightstand which is on. In one corner of the room we SEE the figure of a woman. \nRICK Hellooo! \nTracey walks toward Rick. The light illuminates her. What we see is truly the most beautiful woman on earth. She is totally nude. A vision that would make any man screw and ask questions later. \nRICK (to himself; overwhelmed by her) Eat my chair! \nHe has Rick right where he wants him. \nCROSSBOW TRIGGER \nCole's finger squeezes off a shot. \nRICK \nLuckily he starts to dance with a female guest. This takes him out of line of the arrow. \nHOTEL SUITE WINDOW \nThe arrow zooms through the open window. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nRajah is standing by the door. The arrow zips through the room, misses everyone and lodges in the wall inches from Rajah's head. He looks at the arrow and realizes he almost was killed. \nRAJAH (frightened) Holy Dung is this thing! I sic Milt on you. He get back bitches. Me? I haul ass. \nHe runs out of the room. Rick and O'Neill watch Rajah exit, confused. \nRICK Who was that? \nO'NEILL I don't know. \nRICK (looking at arrow) What's this? \nO'NEILL Got me. \nJust then another arrow comes zipping through the room, lodging in a chair inches from Rick. \nRICK (to new arrow) How 'bout this? \nO'NEILL Still drawing a blank. \nThey turn in the direction the arrow came from and look out the window. They spot Cole loading his bow in the room across the way. \nRICK He look familiar? \nO'NEILL Very. \nRICK C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business. \nThey start for the door as we go to -- \nINT. BACKSTAGE OF BEAUTY PAGEANT \nChulo is waiting outside a door that says \"Dressing Room.\" Several of the beauty contestants race out wearing formal gowns. Laverne follows them, wearing a very tight black dress. Chulo approaches her. \nLAVERNE Stay away from me. \nCHULO I'm not gonna hassle you... Don't worry. You look beautiful. \nLAVERNE (nervous) Think so? I borrowed it from one of the girls. I don't look too fat? \nCHULO You're an angel... A madonna. \nLaverne is moved by this. Before she can respond a Stage Manager takes her by the arm and pushes her on stage. \nSTAGE MANAGER You're on. \nChulo watches Laverne enter the stage to hearty applause. \nANGLE - THE AUDIENCE \nMr. Thomerson and the other Judges sit in the front row making notes. \nMEDIUM SHOT - THE STAGE \nThe girls are lined up on pedestals as the MC approaches Laverne \nMC All right, here is your question, Miss... Er... \nHe looks through his cards hurriedly and is unable to find Laverne's. \nLAVERNE Rivas. \nMC Miss Rivas... Yes... How would you solve our country's present economic problems? \nLAVERNE Who, me? \nMC Yes. \nLAVERNE That's a good question. From the way I understand it, according to supply side economics, when supply exceeds demand, recession is the result. That's why I think we should control the credit markets and increase the prime rate. That way, the consumer price index will stabilize and we will have economic recovery. \nANGLE - THE CROWD \nHe hears a KNOCK on the DOOR. Cole quickly hides his crossbow under the bed and answers the door. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nTracey stands in the open door. Cole's jaw drops open. He has never seen anything as lovely. \nCOLE Yeah? \nTRACEY Make love to me... please. \nShe walks into the room. Cole closes the door. \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COLE'S DOOR \nRick and O'Neill run up to the door. They listen closely. We HEAR the SOUND of Cole's SHIRT being RIPPED off, the buttons flying around the room, then the SOUND of his pant ZIPPER being undone. \nRICK T minus... 3... 2... 1. We have ignition. \ne and O'Neill burst into the room and close the door. \nCOLE (O.S.) Hey! \nINT. COLE'S ROOM \nO'Neill is tying the end of a sheet around the bed post. We SEE the bed is minus its sheets and blankets. \nO'NEILL All set here. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe guys have tied the sheets and blankets together and made a rope. The other end is tied around Cole's chest. And that's all Cole is wearing; he's nude. \nCOLE You guys are never going to get away with this. \nRick stuffs Cole's underwear in his mouth to gag him. \nRICK We're just going to keep you in a safe place until after the party. \nHe and O'Neill lift Cole up and put him out the window. They hang onto the sheet/blanket rope and lower him slowly outside. \nEXT. HOTEL \nWe SEE Cole being lowered from the window. \nCLOSER ON COLE \nHe's struggling, but can do nothing about his predicament. He looks down. \nCOLE'S POV \nThe hotel parking lot is ten stories below. \nCOLE \nHe looks up to the guys. \nRICK AND O'NEILL \nThey look down at him from the window above. \nRICK Now, don't get into any trouble. \nO'NEILL Take care. \nRICK & O'NEILL Byeeeee! \nThey duck inside the window. \nINT. COLE'S ROOM \nRick, O'Neill and Tracey exit the room. \nRICK (to Tracey) Don't you wish you were a guy so you could have fun like this? \nCOLE \nHe's scared to death. \nINT. COLE'S ROOM \nWe SEE that Cole's weight is pulling the bed to the window. \nCOLE \nHe's slowly lowering down the side of the building. \nINT. ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM \nINT. CAR \nStan and O'Neill sit in the car looking at the hotel. \nSTAN How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside? \nRYKO I don't know. \nSTAN What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out. \nRYKO Maybe I did... I don't remember. \nSTAN (through clenched teeth) I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once. \nANGLE - HOTEL ENTRANCE \nJust then the \"Moose\" from the beauty pageant steps outside the hotel for a smoke. \nThe guy in front removes the head, takes a drag of his cigarette and passes it to the guy bringing up the rear. After a beat, smoke steams out the rear end of the costume. \nANGLE - THE GUYS IN THE CAR \nThey both have the same idea. They stroll out of the car and approach the two men in the moose suit. We can't hear what they're saying, but we can SEE the bills Stan is taking out of his pocket. Ryko grabs the moosehead and runs over to the trailer with it. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nThe door opens and Stan and Ryko enter pulling the \"Moose\" by a rope. \nRYKO Can you believe how perfect it fits? \nSTAN Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular. \nJust then Rick and O'Neill saunter into the lobby. \nO'NEILL Hey, you guys... \nRICK Who's your friend? \nSTAN (keeping it a surprise) Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party. \nRICK Great. (to moose) I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing? \nAt that moment he HEARS a SPLAT hit the ground. The guys look down and see a large, shiny clump of shiny brown excrement nestled in the shag carpet. \nRICK (continuing) Say no more. \nThe Manager crosses to them. \nMANAGER I don't know which one of you did this, but you're not going anywhere till you clean up this disgusting mess. \nO'NEILL (resigned) Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel or something? \nAll the guests turn away in disgust. Stan takes out a handkerchief and hands it to Rick, who closes his eyes and picks up the warm little bundle. The Manager turns and walks off in a huff. On the way back to the elevator, Rick checks to see no one is watching and places the handkerchief's contents on the front desk, just OUT OF FRAME. Smiling contentedly, the guys lead the reluctant \"moose\" into the elevator. The doors slam shut. \nANGLE AT THE DESK \nThe Manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out of town. \nMANAGER I'll have the boy take your bags up. \nHe goes to hit the bell and to his surprise, his hand comes down on something soft and mushy. The look on his face tells us what it is. It's the \"gift\" Rick left behind. \nMANAGER (to couple) Excuse me. I seem to have a hand full of potty. \nRevolted, he races into a room marked \"MEN.\" \nANGLE - BALLROOM DOORS \nThe doors open and several people from the Moosehead beauty pageant come out. Mr. Thomerson is one of them. \nEXECUTIVE Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it. \nMR. THOMERSON Any time, Al. \nMr. T. crosses to the door just as Cole comes running in, slightly dazed, wrapped in the tattered remnants of the sheet that held him suspended out the window. They both are shocked to see one another. \nMR. THOMERSON Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened? \nCOLE (nearly hysterical) The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down... \nMR. THOMERSON Take hold of yourself. What room are they in? \nCOLE \nMR. THOMERSON All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself. (disgusted) You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes. \nCOLE Yes, sir. \nO'Neil places the moosehead on the donkey as Rick, Gary, Chulo and Stan pull the donkey out into the hall like pallbearers at a funeral. \nINT. HALLWAY \nMr. Thomerson, who's been standing at the door, takes this time to sneak into the suite right behind them. \nINT. RICK'S SUITE \nMr. Thomerson can't believe the goings-on. People are making out, drinking and dancing. He hides in a corner to watch undercover. \nANGLE IN CORRIDOR \nThe guys shove the donkey onto the elevator and the doors snap shut. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY \nMANAGER (on phone) Yes... I see... Of course we don't allow that sort of thing here, ma'am. No... Well, I'm sorry the noise woke you. I'll take care of it right away. \nHe hangs up and crosses to the elevator. \nMANAGER I've had enough of this. \nJust then the elevator door swings open. The donkey falls out into the lobby. The Manager screams in terror, as do several of the hotel guests. \nMANAGER (continuing) That's it. I'm calling the cops. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nSome more uninvited guests come drifting into the room. \nRICK Welcome, welcome, one and all. \nMR. THOMERSON (O.S.) Rick! \nRICK (recognizing the voice) Oh, no! \nHe turns and spots Mr. Thomerson as he makes his way through the party. \nRICK Christ... it's Mr. Laughs. \nMr. Thomerson goes nose to nose with Rick. \nMR. THOMERSON This is it. You're through. When Debbie hears about this she'll never see you again. Now I'm calling the cops to break up this sex orgy... And toss your ass in jail! \nHe turns away and walks OUT OF FRAME. O'Neill crosses to Rick. \nO'NEILL What are you going to do about it? \nRICK (defeated) What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing. \nO'NEILL I'll stop him... You stall him. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nMr. Thomerson is heading for the phone in the bedroom. \nRICK Mr. Thomerson! \nThomerson stops and turns to Rick. \nRICK (continuing; dramatic) Please, no. Don't ruin my life. Please! \nHe drops to his knees and hugs Thomerson's legs. The party stops and everyone watches. \nRICK (continuing) It's not me. I was brought up on the wrong side of the tracks. A victim of my environment... \nINT. HOTEL BEDROOM - O'NEILL AND LARRY \nLarry is handing O'Neill a plastic bag filled with white powder. \nO'NEILL Is that all the coke in the place? \nLARRY That's it. \nO'NEILL Good. \nO'Neill unscrews the mouthpiece off the phone. He pours the bag of cocaine into the phone. He then screws the mouthpiece back on over this mound of powder. Satisfied with his work, he exits the bedroom. \nINT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM \nThomerson is trying to free himself from Rick's grasp as Rick continues with his \"hard luck\" story. \nRICK My poor old mammy had to take in laundry. My pappy had to work 20 hours a day at the Pez Factory. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nO'Neill gestures to Rick that everything's ready. Rick immediately jumps to his feet. \nO'NEILL What's with her costume? \nO'Neill points and Rick sees Debbie. She doesn't see them. \nRICK (continuing) I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom. \nO'NEILL You got it. \nO'Neill crosses to Debbie. \nO'NEILL (continuing) Hi, baby. You're new here. I don't think the groom's had you yet, has he? \nPUSH IN ON Debbie. She's pissed. \nDEBBIE No, not yet. Where is he? \nINT. BEDROOM \nRick opens the door from the bathroom. The lights are turned off and from the flashing illumination of a neon sign outside the window we can MAKE OUT the outline of Debbie's body on the bed. \nRICK I can't see anything. \nDebbie, in a disguised Southern accent, speaks out. \nDEBBIE Don't turn on the lights, sugar. (seductively) I'll lead you around. \nRICK How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker. \nDEBBIE Why don't you get undressed. \nRick starts to undress. While undressing, he takes on the persona of Mr. Rodgers. He sings Rodgers' opening theme in that same sappy, child-like manner of his. \nRICK (singing) It's a lovely day in the neighborhood. It's a lovely day, it's a beauty, would you be mine, could you be mine. (he's now stripped down to his underwear) ...Please won't you be my neighbor. (as Mr. Rodgers) Hi... Hi there... Today we're going to learn about anatomy... \nHe jumps on top of her and starts mauling her passionately. Debbie snaps on the lights. She throws off her wig and she and Rick come face to face. \nRICK (continuing) Debbie... you're a hooker! I can't believe it! \nShe all but jumps out of bed. \nDEBBIE I can't trust you! \nRICK C'mon, I knew it was you. \nDEBBIE (holding back tears) Rick, you're lying! \nAs Rick protests, she throws on her blouse and runs out of the room. Rick charges after her. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - MAIN ROOM \nThe place is wall to wall people. \nANGLE - DEBBIE \nShe tries to make her way to the exit, but her path is slowed by all the happy revelers. \nDEBBIE (yelling over the din; furious) Let go of me! \nRICK (yelling back) Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly. \nDEBBIE The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life. \nRICK I don't want that. I want to be with you. \nDEBBIE And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment. \nRICK I am committed. I love you. \nJust then Desiree and Mr. Thomerson cross THROUGH FRAME. She's leading him around by the silver chain, which is now attached to his neck. She's also carrying a leather whip. \nDEBBIE I don't believe you. \nRICK You don't believe me? Okay, fine. \nRick gets up on the sofa and yells loudly over the din. \nRICK (continuing) People! Can I have your attention... people! \nEveryone stops what they're doing and looks up. \nRICK (continuing) I want to ask you all a question. Have I had sex with anybody in this room tonight? \nThere's a negative response from the crowd. \nRICK (continuing) Are you sure? \nEveryone responds positively. \n", "test1_input": "\"BACHELOR PARTY\" \nScreenplay by \nNeal Israel & Pat Proft \nStory by \nBob Israel \nSHOOTING DRAFT (1984) \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ST. ANN'S SCHOOL - DAY \nCAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children, obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School. They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both firmly by the shoulders. \nSISTER MARY FRANCIS Make one more move and you'll both be staying late for the rest of the week. \nTHE BOYS (softly; in unison) Sorry, Sister Mary Francis. \nSISTER MARY FRANCIS I didn't hear you. \nTHE BOYS (louder) Sorry, Sister Mary Francis. \nSister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks out past the parking lot gate. \nSuddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking place around the corner. \nSISTER MARY FRANCIS (used to this) Step away from the curb, children. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nZooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life of the party, even when there isn't any party going on. \nWhile chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his capabilities and get serious in his next life... This incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps up to him. \nSISTER MARY FRANCIS You're late again, Rick. \nRICK I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse. \nSISTER MARY FRANCIS There can be no excuse for tardiness. \nRICK You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak. \nHe starts sobbing softly into his hands. \nSISTER MARY FRANCIS All right, stop that... Children, on the bus. \nThe kids obediently file past Rick, who makes like he is drying his tears with his handkerchief. \nRICK Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book. \nSISTER MARY FRANCIS (smiling despite herself) Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is. \nRICK Right... Think it over. \nHe hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus out of the parking lot. \nINT. BUS - DAY \nAs soon as the bus is out of sight of the school, all hell breaks loose. The formally well-mannered children are acting like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top of their lungs. \nANGLE - RICK \nHe removes the St. Christopher statue from the dashboard, revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt. He watches the madness behind him in his rearview mirror, picks up the P.A. microphone and rationally attempts to restore order. \nRICK (over mike) If you don't all calm down I'm gonna drive this thing over a cliff. \nThe kids pay no attention to him. \nRICK (continuing; philosophically) Ah... youth. \nEXT. THE BUS \nRick's bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it. The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his engine. Rick counters by gunning his. \nINT. THE BUS \nAll the kids start screaming \"Race... race.\" \"Wipe 'em out.\" \"Go for it.\" Etc. Some of the kids even start taking out money and start betting one another on the race's outcome. \nANGLE - RICK \nas he readies for action. \nEXT. THE BUSES \n", "test1_true": "WIDE SHOT - ANOTHER STREET \nThe two buses come zooming down the street. \nINT. RICK'S BUS \nThe kids are screaming at Rick to go faster. One of the little boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him. \nEXT. THE STREET - LOW ANGLE \nThe buses squeeze down a narrow street, neck and neck with one another. \nINT. THE BUS \nThe kids are all yelling words of encouragement to Rick, who is hunched over in his seat, driving with the determination of Andy Granitelli. The nauseous kid is now turning a pale shade of green. He moves to an open window, straining to control the inevitable. \nEXT. THE BUSES \nThey race down a steep hill. \nINT. THE BUS \nThe nauseous kid can't hold it any longer. \nEXT. THE OTHER BUS \nSomething hits with a splat against the windshield that resembles Campbell's Chunky Vegetable Soup. \nINT. THE OTHER BUS \nThe other Driver turns on the windshield. It only makes it worse. \nEXT. THE STREET \nRick's bus pulls out in front, accompanied by the cheering of his passengers. Suddenly a stop light looms ahead. Rick puts on his brakes. Both buses stop just in time. \nINT. RICK'S BUS \nRick's kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the front of the bus. Although disheveled, the kids still manage a victorious cheer. \nPHOTOGRAPHER'S POV \nWe're LOOKING THROUGH the camera lens. We SEE a cute one- year-old baby boy. He's sitting on a cuddly blanket. We HEAR the VOICE of Jay O'Neill. He is a baby photographer at Sears. \nO'NEILL (O.S.) Okay, Timmy... hold that smile... and watch the birdie. \nHe takes the picture and we SEE the camera flash. \nO'NEILL (O.S.) There. \nO'NEILL \nWe see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering up her baby. \nO'NEILL These should be in the mail to you by next Friday. \nShe smiles and exits. \nO'NEILL (continuing) Next. \nA beautiful -- and we're talking gorgeous -- WOMAN enters. Her clothes hug every curve of her body. She has her baby in her arms. O'Neill immediately wants her, and now. His eyes settle onto her full breasts. These he likes. \nO'NEILL (continuing) Whoa. Look at those babies. \nShe gets this innuendo and loves it. \nO'NEILL (continuing) How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...? \nWOMAN Klupner. (teasing) Mrs. Klupner. \nO'NEILL Mrs.? \nWOMAN I'm separated. \nO'NEILL Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture. \nHe takes the baby. He has a hard time taking his eyes off her breasts. He places the baby on the blanket. \nO'NEILL (continuing) If I were you, I'd breast feed until I was 17 or 18. (gets behind camera; sizing up the shot) Tell ya what... \nO'NEILL'S POV THROUGH CAMERA \nWe SEE the baby sitting on the blanket. \nO'NEILL (O.S.) Why don't you lean into the picture with your child? \n", "test1_id": 381, "test2_input": "INT. THE THOMERSON'S - NIGHT \nSeveral of Debbie's friends have arrived and are chatting amiably in the living room. Phoebe is dipping potato chips into a bowl that says \"Muffy\" on it. \nPHOEBE Do you have any more of this dip, Mrs. Thomerson? It's really excellent. \nMRS. THOMERSON You just ate Purina Cat Chow. \nPHOEBE Gross me out... \nDebbie comes into the living room and sits next to Bobbie. \nDEBBIE (concerned) What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party? \nBOBBIE They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies. \nDEBBIE What do you mean? \nBOBBIE I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car. \nDEBBIE You're kidding. \nBOBBIE Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. (starts to giggle) \nEXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRick, Ryko, O'Neill, Chulo, Larry and Stan are walking down the hallway, looking for their room. \nO'NEILL (spots the room) Aha! 1002. \nThe guys give out a hearty cheer as they huddle around the door. O'Neill grabs the doorknob. He takes his time, playing up the moment. \nO'NEILL (continuing) And now... \nThe guys lean forward, anticipating the opening of the gates of heaven. \nO'NEILL (continuing) ...to our honored guest Rick, and his life-long friends, I say... (turns the doorknob) ...gentlemen, start your boners. \nHe flings open the door and everyone but he and Rick burst into the room. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nThe guys all but dive into the room. It is a two-room suite with living room/kitcheonette and separate bedroom. The room has been decorated with balloons. A sign reads: \"Happy Bachelor Party!\" It looks far from professionally decorated. Chulo frantically checks out the rooms. \nRYKO Bitchin' place. \nHe hangs a chin-up bar in a doorway and starts to chin himself. \nO'NEILL I did the balloons myself. \nHe takes a prophylactic out of a Trojan carton. He blows it up. On closer examination, we SEE all the balloons are inflated prophylactics. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nChulo returns from his search of the rooms. \nCHULO (crazed) Where's the women, man? We gotta have women. \nO'NEILL Chulo, one thing at a time. \nCHULO Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it. \nSTAN What's first? \nO'NEILL A bit of a warm-up. \nHe threads a film projector. \nO'NEILL (continuing) We'll spend an hour with \"Nymphos Without Pants\"... \nRICK Olivier's in that, right? \nO'NEILL Then it's on to the real thing. \nGUYS (cheering) All right! \nRyko flips off the lights as O'Neill puts the projector into forward and the title flashes on a movie screen. All the guys yell in anticipation. \nHOME MOVIE SCREEN \nWe SEE a man stepping out of a shower. He puts on his robe and exits the bathroom. To his surprise and to the delight of our guys, two young, beautiful Nordic looking women, dressed in micro-minis and see-through blouses stand waiting for him. \nCHULO (O.S.) They're Danish, I know it. I'm crazy for Danes. \nRYKO AND CHULO \nsit watching the screen. \n", "test2_true": "CHULO I'd like to jerk and press those babies. \nRICK AND O'NEILL \nRICK (to O'Neill) And I thought we wouldn't have any meaningful conversation. \nON SCREEN \nThe man takes off his robe. The girls start to seductively undress. \nGUYS (O.S.) (excitedly) All right, yeah, yeah, yeah... \nSuddenly an abrupt jump cut. The girls are undressed and lying on top of the man. Our guys are seriously let down. \nGUYS \nEVERYONE (disappointed) Awwww... \nO'NEILL \nHe can't figure it out. \nON THE SCREEN \nAs the women kiss the man from his head slowly down his chest, past his navel and heading south... \nGUYS \nTheir eyes start to widen like a child in a Keene painting. \nGUYS Yes, go, go, yes, go... \nON THE SCREEN \nAnother abrupt jump cut spliced together with what looks like a band-aid, and the girls are sitting on the side of the bed. The man is recovering from the best sex he's ever encountered. \nGUYS \nGUYS (disappointed) Awwwwww... \nRick turns to a shocked O'Neill. \nRICK Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican. \nO'NEILL This isn't right. \nGUYS' POV \nThey watch the screen. The two women seem to be taking a liking to each other. They begin to fall onto the bed and entwine. \nGUYS Please, yes, do it, yes, yes, oh yes... \nA jump cut and they are dressing. Stan can't take it anymore. He jumps to his feet. \nSTAN Where are the dirty parts? I'm a doctor. I can see these things. \nCHULO What a waste of two women. \nO'Neill rises abruptly. \nO'NEILL I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes. \nCHULO (in ecstasy) Women! \nEveryone cheers. \nINT. THOMERSON HOUSE \nThe girls are having a great time. The front DOORBELL RINGS. Mrs. Thomerson answers it. Standing in the doorway is Tina Stahl, Stan's wife; she's late for the shower. Behind her are two obvious hookers: Margot and Darlene. Tina doesn't know either of the girls. \nMRS. THOMERSON Yes? \nBefore Tina can speak, Margot speaks up. She's reading from the piece of paper Cole gave her. \nMARGOT (through heavy gum chewing) Yeah, hi. Look, is this... \nINSERT - PIECE OF PAPER \nMargot reads the address. \nMARGOT (O.S.) 838 North Franek Avenue? \nBACK TO SCENE \nMRS. THOMERSON Yes. \n", "test2_id": 382, "test3_input": "COLE She's mine! \nHe drives off. \nRICK He's kidnapped her! Everyone into the bus! \nThey all board the bus. \nEXT. CITY STREET \nAs Cole rounds a corner, a tire comes loose and rolls off the car -- thanks to Chulo's shoddy workmanship. \nINT. PORSCHE \nCOLE Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. \nHe looks to the rear and sees Rick's bus not far behind them. Suddenly he spots something O.S. He grabs Debbie and runs OUT OF FRAME. \nEXT. CITY STREET \nA city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center of the street. A man in the back of the truck is leisurely placing orange cones in the center line of the road. \nCole, with Debbie in tow, grabs the truck's DRIVER and hauls him out of his seat. He then places Debbie inside the truck and him at the wheel. He peels out. Our man with the cones in the back is unaware of what has happened. He keeps placing the cones on the street. However, now the truck is hitting speeds in the upper 70's. The man's leisure pace speeds up. He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed. \nINT. RICK'S BUS \nRick, is plowing into the cones and knocking them all over. \nMAINTENANCE TRUCK \nOur man with the cones is almost completely exhausted. \nEXT. HIGHWAY \nRick is in pursuit, knocking over cones. He's almost caught up with Cole. \nEXT. STREET \nThe vehicles reach the top of the hill. Cole grabs a sharp left and pulls into a movie theater parking lot. The maneuver loses Rick for a second. Rick jams on the brakes and doubles back into the parking lot. \nEXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT \nCole pulls up with a SCREECH in front of the theater. He grabs Debbie and jumps out of the truck. He drags her into the theater entrance. \nRick brings his bus to a stop and he and the gang pour out of the bus. \nCOLE He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: \"24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!\" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters. \nRICK Fan out and look for them. \nThey all go running into various theaters. \nANGLE - RYKO \nHe approaches a theater and sees the title of the movie playing inside. \nRYKO Aw, I've seen this one already. \nRick chooses a theater and goes inside. \nINT. MOVIE THEATER \nThe patrons are wearing their 3D glasses, watching the action on the screen. On the movie screen we SEE a man and a woman arguing. Cole and Debbie enter the theater. They run down to the front of the screen, heading for an exit. Rick enters. He gives chase and catches up with Cole. \nHe takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back. Behind them on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman. \nA fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks. The punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth. \nMAN (to LADY next to him) Gee, what a realistic effect. \nWOMAN Yeah, like you're in the movie with them. \nRick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel Cole. Cole grabs a woman's purse and begins to hit Rick with it. Cole runs out of the aisle as Rick climbs over people and dives onto Cole, knocking him to the aisle. \nPATRON (to his date) Best 3D I've ever seen. \nAs the movie ends, Rick has Cole by the collar and is dragging him out of the theater. \nINT. MALL OUTSIDE THEATER \nRick exits the theater with Cole. He tosses Cole to Chulo. Debbie comes running behind Rick. \nRICK (to Debbie) Are you okay? \nDEBBIE Yeah. \nRICK This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout? \n", "test3_true": "The Patrons are exiting. All of them are very up and excited by their 3D experience. \nWOMAN Absolutely amazing. \nA Man who has taken a punch and has had his jacket ripped to shreds doesn't seem pleased. \nMAN I've seen better. \nEXT. BLUFF - DAY \nIt's another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean. Just right for Rick and Debbie's wedding. We SEE the wedding in progress. The area is adorned with flowers. \nThe many guests are seated and taken in the moment. Among these are Tracey, Desiree and Gary's she-man, who waves to Gary as he stands with the other ushers, Chulo, Ryko and Larry. Chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears. He looks over at Laverne, who smiles to him. \nCHULO (to Ryko) Hey, man, don't forget my bachelor party's next Friday night. \nGARY I'll get the hookers. \nRYKO No way. \nNearby stand the maids of honor, Bobbie, Phoebie and Ilene, who blows a kiss to her date, Ray (one of the Japanese businessmen). \nThe Thomersons sit in the front row. Neither of them is cherishing this moment. \nMR. THOMERSON (sotto; to Mrs. Thomerson) We'll have morons for grandkids. (resigned to the fact) But... at least we'll have grandkids. \nThey sort of smile at each other at the thought. \nFather Falwell is almost through with the ceremony. A car pulls up in the b.g. Exiting the car is Stan and a WOMAN. O'Neill, the best man, sees the car. He pokes Rick. He indicates to Rick someone has arrived. \nSTAN \nWe SEE the man in the car is Stan. He ushers the lady in the car to Larry. He's surprised at who she is: his wife. \nLARRY Sue! \nSUE Hi, honey. \nLARRY How'd you get here? \nSUE Rick called me. \nLarry looks to Rick and gives him a warm smile and a wave. Rick acknowledges Larry. \nLARRY Why don't we go someplace and talk. \nThey walk off. \nFATHER FALWELL \nFATHER FALWELL Now, before I pronounce you man and wife, the groom wishes to recite his vow to Debbie. Richard. \nTHOMERSONS They fear the worst. \nMR. THOMERSON Oh, God Almighty. \nRICK \nHe turns to Debbie. He waits a beat and begins. \nRICK Cheese. I love you more than cheese. And I love cheese a lot. \nTHOMERSONS They hide their faces in their hands. Off in the distance a storm is coming in fast over the ocean. The wind begins to pick up. Undaunted, Rick continues his soliloquy. \nRICK In fact, more than dairy products in general. I love dairy. My love is cream. Pour me on the cereal of your life... \nNow it starts to rain. \nFATHER FALWELL \nHe wants this to end. He calls softly to Rick, trying to get his attention. \nFATHER FALWELL Rick. Rick. Hey... \nPeople begin to scurry for cover. In the b.g., under a tree, we SEE Larry and his wife huddled in each other's arms. From the way they look, they have worked things out. \nRICK \nRICK I think this song pretty much sums up the way I feel at this moment. \nHe begins to sing the theme from \"The Flintstones\" with all the gusto of Jack Jones. \nFather Falwell has had enough. \nFATHER FALWELL (rapid fire) I now pronounce you man and wife. Goodbye. \n", "test3_id": 383}

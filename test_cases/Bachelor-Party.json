{"test1_input": "RICK Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness. \nDEBBIE You better not have too much joy. \nRICK Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow... (starts singing) We're going to the chapel and we're... \nDEBBIE (singing) Gonna get married... \nANGLE - THE GUYS \nThey start to join in the song in a little less than perfect harmony. \nEVERYBODY Going to the chapel and we're gonna get married. \nDEBBIE Gee, I really love you... \nRICK And we're gonna get ma-a-a-ried. \nEVERYBODY (whooping it up) Going to the chapel of love. \nRICK Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah. \nEXT. BUS \nThe bus zooms down the street. \nEVERYBODY (V.O.) Going to the chapel of love. \nEXT. THOMERSON'S - DUSK \nRick's bus comes up to the driveway in front of the house and stops. \nINT. RICK'S BUS - DUSK \nRICK This is it, lady. Last stop. \nDEBBIE Can't I just go with you guys? \nRICK Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady. \nHe opens the door, picks Debbie up and carries her out to the sidewalk. \nDEBBIE Remember, you promised... no screwing around. \nRICK Did I promise that? I don't remember that... \nDEBBIE You're really pissing me off. \nShe grabs Rick and wraps her arm around him in a playful headlock. \nRICK Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave. \nDEBBIE Your mother's not dead. \nRICK Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her. \nDebbie lets go of his neck. \nDEBBIE Have a good time. Don't make it too late. \nRICK Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap. \nDEBBIE I love you. \nThey kiss, and the guys whistle in the background. Then Debbie starts toward the house and Rick hops back into the bus. He gets into the seat and sits there for a moment, watching Debbie with a guilty look as she goes into the house. \nO'NEILL (to Rick) What's the matter? \nRICK (snapping out of it) Nothing... Let's get crazy! \nRYKO All right! \nCHULO When do the girls get to the party? \nO'NEILL Don't worry, Gary's taking care of that now. \nThe guys holler and whoop it up as Rick puts the bus in gear and takes off down the street. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GRIMY STREET CORNER - EVENING \nJUMBO, a well-dressed behemoth in a sky blue suit and widebrimmed hat, is standing on a street corner talking to Gary. \nGARY So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop. \nJUMBO Let's see your bread. \n", "test1_true": "JUMBO (continuing) Okay, I got just what you're looking for. (calling off) Margot... Darlene... \nTwo shapely HOOKERS in tight-fitting clothes come up to them. \nGARY They'll do just fine. Hiya, girls. Look, after the orgy, maybe we could have coffee. \nThe girls look at him with \"Is he for real?\" in their eyes. \nJUMBO Shorty, where's the party? \nGary takes some slips of paper out of his pocket and hands Jumbo one. \nGARY Park View Hotel, Room 1002. \nJUMBO They'll be up there in a half hour. \nGARY Okay. Nice to meet you both. \nGary turns, almost collides with a garbage can, and starts walking down the street. He passes a parked Porsche. After a beat, Cole Whittier sticks his head up and watches Gary walk off. Then he hops out of his car and approaches Jumbo and the girls. \nCOLE Hi. I must have just missed my friend. He hired you for a bachelor party. \nJUMBO At the Park View Hotel, Room 1002. What about it. \nCole's face lights up. This is the information he needed. \nCOLE Yeah. Right. (takes out piece of paper) This is the new address. We changed our minds and decided to send the girls over to his house instead. \nHe takes out a fifty-dollar bill. \nCOLE (continuing) And here's a fifty... I want this to be a surprise, so you never saw me, okay? \nJUMBO (pocketing the money) No problem. \nCole smiles happily as he slithers back to his car. \nCOLE (to himself) Now she'll see what kind of jackoff he is. \nANGLE - HOTEL \nA parking VALET crosses to the bus as Rick hands him the keys. \nRICK Be careful with it. It's a rental. \nThe guys hop out with the enthusiasm of a home team that's just won the state championship. They race in the front door. A banner over the door reads: \"WELCOME MISS MOOSEHEAD BEER PAGEANT.\" \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT \nThis is a pretty plush place. The kind of hotel that prides itself on its classy image. The guys are totally unaware of the sedate atmosphere in the lobby as they go screaming toward the elevators. \nO'NEILL (to some dignified guests) We who are about to go ape shit salute you. \nRYKO All right, I'm stoked! \nJust as they are about to get into the elevator, a hand comes INTO FRAME and holds the door so it will not close. \nWIDEN TO INCLUDE the MANAGER. All their carrying-on stops when the guys see him staring grimly at them. If he wasn't a hotel manager, he'd be a mortician. He has a constant expression on his face that suggests he's constantly sucking lemons. \nMANAGER Just where do you guys think you are? \nO'NEILL The Library of Congress? \nCHULO Detroit? \nLARRY Beyond the sun? \nRICK Are any of those right? \nMANAGER This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone? \nRICK Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002. \nRick takes out his key. \nMANAGER It's on the tenth floor. \nRICK What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later. \nThe door starts to close and the guys start yelling. \nMANAGER Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys. \nRICK I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job. \nThe door slams shut before the Manager can say anything else. \n", "test1_id": 381, "test2_input": "O'Neil places the moosehead on the donkey as Rick, Gary, Chulo and Stan pull the donkey out into the hall like pallbearers at a funeral. \nINT. HALLWAY \nMr. Thomerson, who's been standing at the door, takes this time to sneak into the suite right behind them. \nINT. RICK'S SUITE \nMr. Thomerson can't believe the goings-on. People are making out, drinking and dancing. He hides in a corner to watch undercover. \nANGLE IN CORRIDOR \nThe guys shove the donkey onto the elevator and the doors snap shut. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY \nMANAGER (on phone) Yes... I see... Of course we don't allow that sort of thing here, ma'am. No... Well, I'm sorry the noise woke you. I'll take care of it right away. \nHe hangs up and crosses to the elevator. \nMANAGER I've had enough of this. \nJust then the elevator door swings open. The donkey falls out into the lobby. The Manager screams in terror, as do several of the hotel guests. \nMANAGER (continuing) That's it. I'm calling the cops. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nSome more uninvited guests come drifting into the room. \nRICK Welcome, welcome, one and all. \nMR. THOMERSON (O.S.) Rick! \nRICK (recognizing the voice) Oh, no! \nHe turns and spots Mr. Thomerson as he makes his way through the party. \nRICK Christ... it's Mr. Laughs. \nMr. Thomerson goes nose to nose with Rick. \nMR. THOMERSON This is it. You're through. When Debbie hears about this she'll never see you again. Now I'm calling the cops to break up this sex orgy... And toss your ass in jail! \nHe turns away and walks OUT OF FRAME. O'Neill crosses to Rick. \nO'NEILL What are you going to do about it? \nRICK (defeated) What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing. \nO'NEILL I'll stop him... You stall him. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nMr. Thomerson is heading for the phone in the bedroom. \nRICK Mr. Thomerson! \nThomerson stops and turns to Rick. \nRICK (continuing; dramatic) Please, no. Don't ruin my life. Please! \nHe drops to his knees and hugs Thomerson's legs. The party stops and everyone watches. \nRICK (continuing) It's not me. I was brought up on the wrong side of the tracks. A victim of my environment... \nINT. HOTEL BEDROOM - O'NEILL AND LARRY \nLarry is handing O'Neill a plastic bag filled with white powder. \nO'NEILL Is that all the coke in the place? \nLARRY That's it. \nO'NEILL Good. \nO'Neill unscrews the mouthpiece off the phone. He pours the bag of cocaine into the phone. He then screws the mouthpiece back on over this mound of powder. Satisfied with his work, he exits the bedroom. \nINT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM \nThomerson is trying to free himself from Rick's grasp as Rick continues with his \"hard luck\" story. \nRICK My poor old mammy had to take in laundry. My pappy had to work 20 hours a day at the Pez Factory. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nO'Neill gestures to Rick that everything's ready. Rick immediately jumps to his feet. \n", "test2_true": "MR. THOMERSON No sob story is going to change my mind. \nMr. Thomerson pushes O'Neill aside and enters the bedroom. \nO'NEILL The phone's all yours. \nMr. Thomerson, in the bedroom, picks up the receiver. As he does so, a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece. He screams at Rick, gesturing with the phone in his hand as he dials. Each move produces a large cloud of powder, which causes him to sniffle slightly. \nMR. THOMERSON I never liked you. I've never liked any of your friends. I've hated you from the first time I saw you. And now you are out of my life. You are out of my life! \nHe starts to react from inhaling the powder. He puts the receiver to his ear. He takes a deep breath and tries to dial another number. A large cloud of coke flies up his nose. He's stunned. He takes another deep drag. He's hooked. He forgets all about dialing. He jams the receiver against his nose and takes deep drag after deep drag. \nDesiree, still wearing her leather mask, crosses to him and sits down next to him on the bed. He gives her a big, wide smile. \nO'Neill closes the door. \nO'NEILL Reach out and snort someone. \nRICK I'm saved. Let's party! \nEveryone starts to whoop it up again. \nINT. JAPANESE SUITE \nIt's still a standoff between the girls and the horny Japanese. \nDEBBIE Let's give them what they want. \nPHOEBE What? \nDebbie opens the bedroom door and motions for the Japanese to file in. \nDEBBIE Let's go. Everyone inside. \nThe Japanese immediately put two and two together and get orgy. These are some happy fellas as they enter the bedroom. \nBOBBIE Deb, we're pretending to be hookers. \nDEBBIE (herding in the last Japanese) Right in here. The big show starts in one minute. \nThe Japanese man enters the room. Debbie slams the door shut behind him. \nDEBBIE Let's go. \nILENE Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it! \nDEBBIE Ilene, are you crazy? \nILENE I know what I'm doing... Go! \nThe girls run out the door. \nINT. JAPANESE BEDROOM \nIlene smiles. She has what she wants. She walks into the bedroom, surrounded by panting Japanese. \nILENE Gentlemen, the gods have answered your prayers... Bonzai! \nShe takes a running leap and dives on top of the Japanese. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nDebbie and the ladies run to an elevator. Debbie presses the \"down\" button. \nMRS. THOMERSON I hope Ilene's all right. \nDEBBIE I hope those guys are all right. \nThe elevator door opens, revealing the donkey lying flat on his back. His stiff legs point skyward. The girls see him and scream. They run down the hall to the stairway. On the way Debbie notices she's passing Room 1002. She HEARS the party SOUNDS inside. \nShe heads for the room angrily. This is a lady out to even a score. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nAs Debbie opens the door, her father walks by with Desiree on his arm. Neither sees the other. Debbie enters the room. She is surprised by the masses of humanity rubbing shoulders with one another in the room. \nO'Neill looks over from the other side of the room and spots her. He isn't fooled for a minute by her wig and mini skirt. He runs over to Rick. \nO'NEILL Guess who's here? Another surprise guest. \nRICK Who? \nO'NEILL Debbie. \nRICK My Debbie? \n", "test2_id": 382, "test3_input": "O'NEILL What's with her costume? \nO'Neill points and Rick sees Debbie. She doesn't see them. \nRICK (continuing) I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom. \nO'NEILL You got it. \nO'Neill crosses to Debbie. \nO'NEILL (continuing) Hi, baby. You're new here. I don't think the groom's had you yet, has he? \nPUSH IN ON Debbie. She's pissed. \nDEBBIE No, not yet. Where is he? \nINT. BEDROOM \nRick opens the door from the bathroom. The lights are turned off and from the flashing illumination of a neon sign outside the window we can MAKE OUT the outline of Debbie's body on the bed. \nRICK I can't see anything. \nDebbie, in a disguised Southern accent, speaks out. \nDEBBIE Don't turn on the lights, sugar. (seductively) I'll lead you around. \nRICK How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker. \nDEBBIE Why don't you get undressed. \nRick starts to undress. While undressing, he takes on the persona of Mr. Rodgers. He sings Rodgers' opening theme in that same sappy, child-like manner of his. \nRICK (singing) It's a lovely day in the neighborhood. It's a lovely day, it's a beauty, would you be mine, could you be mine. (he's now stripped down to his underwear) ...Please won't you be my neighbor. (as Mr. Rodgers) Hi... Hi there... Today we're going to learn about anatomy... \nHe jumps on top of her and starts mauling her passionately. Debbie snaps on the lights. She throws off her wig and she and Rick come face to face. \nRICK (continuing) Debbie... you're a hooker! I can't believe it! \nShe all but jumps out of bed. \nDEBBIE I can't trust you! \nRICK C'mon, I knew it was you. \nDEBBIE (holding back tears) Rick, you're lying! \nAs Rick protests, she throws on her blouse and runs out of the room. Rick charges after her. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - MAIN ROOM \nThe place is wall to wall people. \nANGLE - DEBBIE \nShe tries to make her way to the exit, but her path is slowed by all the happy revelers. \nDEBBIE (yelling over the din; furious) Let go of me! \nRICK (yelling back) Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly. \nDEBBIE The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life. \nRICK I don't want that. I want to be with you. \nDEBBIE And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment. \nRICK I am committed. I love you. \nJust then Desiree and Mr. Thomerson cross THROUGH FRAME. She's leading him around by the silver chain, which is now attached to his neck. She's also carrying a leather whip. \nDEBBIE I don't believe you. \nRICK You don't believe me? Okay, fine. \nRick gets up on the sofa and yells loudly over the din. \nRICK (continuing) People! Can I have your attention... people! \nEveryone stops what they're doing and looks up. \nRICK (continuing) I want to ask you all a question. Have I had sex with anybody in this room tonight? \nThere's a negative response from the crowd. \nRICK (continuing) Are you sure? \nEveryone responds positively. \n", "test3_true": "All the guests go back to partying. Rick drops off the sofa and faces Debbie. \nRICK (continuing) See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand? \nDEBBIE (melted) Yes... \nRICK Great. Now, what do you want to do about it? \nDEBBIE (sexy) Let's get naked. \nRICK You're on. \nShe takes him by the hand and crosses into the other bedroom. \nINT. OTHER BEDROOM \nRick and Debbie enter. To their surprise they find a man wearing a leather mask tied to the bed and happily licking Desiree's boots, which she dangles in front of him. She also holds a whip over his head. Despite the mask, there is something very familiar about his face, and the white powder encrusted all over his nose. \nDebbie picks up on this immediately. \nDEBBIE (shocked) Daddy? \nSure enough, Mr. Thomerson looks up and grimaces, knowing he's been caught with his bondage down. He tries to say something, but the boot in his mouth prevents anything intelligent from coming out. \nMR. THOMERSON Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable... \nRICK Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E. \nINT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM \nThe party has reached fever pitch. Suddenly police SIRENS pierce through the party sounds. Everyone freezes. We HEAR the Hotel Manager BEATING on the DOOR with his fists. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR \nThe Manager is pounding on the door. By his side are several UNIFORMED POLICE. \nMANAGER You're all under arrest. Open up! \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nRICK (to everyone in the room) Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid! \nEveryone starts to panic and run for the doors. \nRICK (continuing) I'm glad no one is panicking. \nHe snaps up his clothes from the bedroom. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR \nMANAGER (to Police) Break it in, boys! \nThe cops rear back for a run at the door. At that moment the hotel door opens up and the cops and the Manager are trampled by Rick, Debbie, Mr. Thomerson, Rick's gang, other guests and assorted hookers. They run down the stairs. The cops pick themselves up and give chase. The Manager looks inside the room and is devastated by what he sees... Hiroshima looked better after the A-bomb. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY \nWe SEE the police have collared Bobbie, Phoebe, Mrs. Thomerson and the other ladies of the shower as hooker suspects. Our bachelor party mob now charges down the stairs and out the hotel doors. \nThe cops grab Mr. Thomerson as he tries to get out, and they throw him in line with the others. Unfortunately for him, he's standing next to Mrs. Thomerson. \nMRS. THOMERSON Ed! What are you doing here? \nBefore he can answer, Mrs. Thomerson checks out his shocking leather outfit. \nMRS. THOMERSON (angry) Ed... you're kinky! \nMR. THOMERSON The phone made me do it! \nMRS. THOMERSON (shocked) You've been having strange sex...! \nMR. THOMERSON No, Brett, I... \nMRS. THOMERSON It's all right... (proudly) So have I. \nHe is totally blown away by this as the cops lead them out of the room. \nMRS. THOMERSON I've seen another man's diddly. \nEXT. HOTEL - MORNING \nOur people pile out of the hotel. Rick, Debbie and all Rick's friends run down the street. \nSuddenly a Porsche pulls up between Rick and Debbie. It's Cole. He reaches over and pulls Debbie into the car with him. She screams. \nRICK Cole, what the hell are you doing? \n", "test3_id": 383}

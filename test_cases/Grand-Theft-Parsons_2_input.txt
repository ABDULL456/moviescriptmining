LARRY Meet Bernice. 
PHIL Bernice? 
LARRY Bernice is a Cadillac Superior Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral Coach. We've got a Seven gallon V8 engine offering three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions per minute. You're looking at a twenty one feet beauty with a one hundred and fifty six inch wheelbase containing a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic transmission. Bernice weighs over six thousand pounds. 
There is a very long silence. 
PHIL It's yellow. 
LARRY Yes, it's yellow.    Bernice comes in yellow. 
PHIL It's supposed to be black. 
LARRY But they're all black. 
CON TINUE D: 
PHIL That might be my point. 
LARRY So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse? 
PHIL I paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse. 
LARRY (patiently) No, you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse, and a hearse is what you've got. If you take a long, hard look at Bernice, you'll see that she's one of a kind. She's big, she's fast, she's comfortable, and she's beautiful. But she's not black. 
They stare at each other for a moment.       Then Phil sighs deeply. 
PHIL Okay.   Where are the keys? 
LARRY Why? 
PHIL I gotta go. Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again. 
LARRY Oh, no. She doesn't go anywhere without me. 
Phil thinks this over. 
PHIL Okay.   Well, let's boogie. 
Larry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps and band equipment that now sits in the garage. Phil puts the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car. 
INT. HEARSE. DAY 
Larry pulls a screwdriver out of the glove compartment and jigs it about in the ignition until the engine catches. 
CON TINUE D: Then he turns the keys and pull up and down to undo the steering lock. Phil watches curiously. 
LARRY Someone stole her last summer. 
PHIL Well, I've paid top dollar, so it's nice to see I'm getting the best... 
LARRY How did you hear of Bernice and me? 
PHIL You are famous throughout the greater Los Angeles area. 
Larry looks pleased. 
PHIL (CONT'D) But you are the only guy with a hearse. Don't go getting carried away... 
EXT. LA HIGHWAY. DAY 
One backfire, and Bernice is ready. The hearse weaves erratically across the road and then disappears in a cloud of exhaust smoke. 
INT. BARBARA'S HOME. EVENING 
Barbara sits at a table in her shabby kitchen, reading the will. She lights a cigarette and sits back in her chair. EXT. LAX. EVENING 
The hearse drives under a huge sign which reads 'Welcome to Los Angeles Airport' and peels off the main road past some offices and cargo stores. Bernice drives into a giant hangar and pulls up outside a dark and shuttered office. 
INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. EVENING 
Phil glances out of the window. 
PHIL Pull over. 
Larry parks, and Phil looks at his watch.

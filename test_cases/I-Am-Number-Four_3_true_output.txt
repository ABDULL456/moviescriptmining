MARK The Sheriff's Department is starting to put up roadblocks. You guys better get moving. Six and Sarah join them. 
JOHN You good to go? 
SIX Don't worry about me. John nods to Sam. 
JOHN Sam, ride with Six. 
SIX We don't need baggage. Sam steps in front of her, determined. 
SAM I have to find out if the Mogs took my dad. Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam. 
SIX You slow us down, I'll shoot you myself. Sarah looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions. 
SARAH I want to come too. 
JOHN You need to stay here. 
SARAH Why? 
JOHN You could have died last night. I'm not putting you in danger again. Mark's promised to look after you. 
Tears tumble down her cheeks. 
SARAH I don't want to say goodbye. 
JOHN I'll come back for you. 
SARAH When? 
JOHN When it's safe. She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin. 
JOHN Where I'm from, we only give our heart to one person. I've given mine to you. 
(BEAT) I love you, Sarah. Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends when John hears an URGENT RUSTLE in the woods. They turn and watch as 
BERNIE KOSAR limps into view. Blood mats his fur and his face is scratched but he's alive. OFF John's relief... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PICNIC AREA - DAY 
Sam sits behind Six on her motorcycle. John holds Bernie as he straddles his Harley. Bernie morphs into a gecko and darts into his pocket. Sarah studies John and Six, unsure. John THROTTLES the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah. He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at Mark's side. RAIN spits as the motorcycles start off. 
JOHN (V.O.) This is the first town I've left without Henri. The first one I have a reason to come back to. John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to brand the image of their faces onto their memories. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
The bikes blur past the âWelcome to Paradiseâ sign. 
JOHN (V.O.) He warned me the pain would be unbearable if I left her. He was right. 
EXT. TEXAS PLAINS - DAY 
A straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness. 
JOHN (V.O.) But I don't regret it. The pain reminds me what's at stake. A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view. 
JOHN (V.O.) We must find the others and face our enemy together. I'm not sure how we can stop them. But nothing is inevitable. I know that now. Thunderheads darken the horizon. 
JOHN (V.O.) I am Number 4. His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the battles yet to be fought. He's ready to face a future unmapped and uncharted. Ready. 
FADE OUT. 
THE END

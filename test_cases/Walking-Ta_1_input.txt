RAY Oh now you're a CROOKED cop doing favours for friends. That's how it starts. See next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks, frisking dudes crotches. 
CHRIS Are you done? Ray I need your help. 
RAY Oh don't do that. 
CHRIS I need you to take me to drugs school. 
RAY I get to wear a uniform? 
A montage ensues, with Chris and Ray busting various drug dealers.

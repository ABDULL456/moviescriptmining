EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY 
IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine engine. It's bad, but still fixable. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.) The relays are intact. What's our next move? 
TONY Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push. 
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded! 
TONY Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag... 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Speak English! 
TONY See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it. 
INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ DAY 
Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand out. The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs right at him. At the last second, MJÖLNIR flies into his hand and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET. HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS 
THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR. Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws Mjölnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but can't. Mjölnir rests atop his hand. Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING. Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off. 
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY 
Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors. 
NICK FURY We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE appears. 
AGENT MARIA HILL 
GRENADE! The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready, waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn. A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill, who looks hot and sexy holding her gun. 
INT. HELICARRIER ARMORY SECTION ­ DAY

AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.) Sir, the HULK and Thor are in shuttle levels 2, 3 and 4! 
AGENT MARIA HILL Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart! 
NICK FURY Get his attention. 
AGENT MARIA HILL (on her EARPIECE) Escort 606, proceed to 270 MAIN SHUTTLE! Don't get too close.

EXT. OUTSIDE SHUTTLE 
ESCORT 606 PILOT slowly makes his way in. sees the action going between Thor and the HULK. 
ESCORT 606 PILOT Target acquired. Target engaged. (pulls the trigger; fires guns at HULK) A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS... 
ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT. 
ESCORT 606 PILOT 
TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY! HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but 
HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR!

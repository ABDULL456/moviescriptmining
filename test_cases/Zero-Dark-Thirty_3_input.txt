INT. DINING AREA 
Jessica pours two glasses of wine and raises a toast to her colleague, JOHN. 
JESSICA Not to get technical, but this guy is actually the first big break we've had since 9/11. To big breaks and the little people that make them happen. Clink. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) So far, everything he's said we've cross checked and it's proved legit... and I think the money is persuasive. 25 million dollars?! That buys a new life. 
JOHN Do you think he might be exaggerating his access? 
JESSICA Possibly. But Al Qaeda needs doctors and they are short staffed and that could explain his rise. In six months to a year, if he doesn't fuck up, he could be called in to treat bin Laden. And at that moment, with 25 mil on the table, I think he gives up the Big Man. And if he doesn't, we kill him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN CIA COMPOUND - AFTERNOON 
The same gathering as the day before, waiting under the merciless sun. 
SUPERIMPOSE: DECEMBER 30, 2009 Jessica turns to her crew, which includes LAUREN, a young operative, ZIED, a Jordanian intelligence agent, and the base's CIA SECURITY GUARD, among others. They rehearse the impending meeting. 
JESSICA So John? (John turns to her) When he arrives, I'll set the tone, and then I'll flip it to you - and you'll talk about asset protection. 
JOHN Roger that. 
JESSICA Then Lauren, I know you want to get some questions in there - but give Balawi time after John speaks. We'll cover the basics and have his birthday cake, then we'll get to the nitty gritty. 
Jessica turns to Zied. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) Is that order okay, or do you want to introduce everyone? 
ZIED I'll introduce you, and you introduce your team. He knows this is a high level meeting. 
SECURTY GUARD Quick question: all is taking place inside our main building? 
JESSICA Right. And Lauren? Washington will want real time updates so please stay on top of that. Be concise. The Director is in the loop. And I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't update the President. 
LAUREN Yeah, I'm on it. They take in the possibilities. 
JESSICA Now, I just need to get Balawi's ass down here. 
LATER - Waiting and waiting. No cars approach. The sun beats down. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN - ROAD TO SOUTH GATE 
Several hundred yards before the Camp entrance is a beat-up SEDAN. The car pulls up to the checkpoint but doesn't proceed. 
JESSICA (to the Security Gyard) Why are there gate guards there? We talked about this, no one is supposed to be there when my source arrives. You might have spooked him already! 
SECURTY GUARD Procedures only work if we follow them every time. 
JESSICA This time is different - I'm sorry I can't explain, but it's for a good cause. 
SECURTY GUARD Look, I'm responsible for everyone's safety, okay? It's not just about you. 
JESSICA I just need them to go away for a minute. You can search him as soon as he gets here. The Security Guard pauses, then into his radio: 
SECURTY GUARD 
(INTO RADIO) All stations, go ahead and stand down. 
CHECKPOINT GUARD 
(OVER RADIO) Roger. 
EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN - GUARD POST 
The guards move away from their post. The sedan drives past the gate into a maze of barriers. We follow the car as it navigates the maze of HESCO barriers, kicking up a cloud of dust. 
EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN - CIA COMPOUND 
Jessica runs back to her team and flashes a thumbs up. She smiles and pulls out her phone, sending a text.

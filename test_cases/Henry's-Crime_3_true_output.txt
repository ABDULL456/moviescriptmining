MADAME RANEVSKY Let me go! 
HENRY I can't. Pause. 
MADAME RANEVSKY Why are you doing this? 
LOPHAKIN You're just afraid. 
MADAME RANEVSKY I'm not afraid of anything -- She kicks out at him. 
MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D) What am I afraid of Henry? Tell me! 
LOPHAKIN You're afraid because I love you. That hits her. Pause. She breaks away from him, stepping back... 
SHOCKED ACTORS On the side of the stage. 
ON JULIE 
MADAME RANEVSKY ...what? She searches his expression now... 
HENRY Meet me in Moscow. She can't move. The audience is rapt. 
HENRY (CONT'D) 
(SOFTLY) Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow. There are tears in her eyes now... 
AUDIENCE MEMBER Go with him! 
ANOTHER AUDIENCE MEMBER Meet him in Moscow! 
DAREK at the back of the theatre. Stunned : 
DAREK 
(TO SIMON) He loves her. 
JULIE AND HENRY She whispers softly. Looks down at his leg. 
JULIE Henry. You're bleeding. 
HENRY I know. 
IN THE BACK Darek is alive once more... 
DAREK (whisper to Simon) Lights down ten. Down ten more. Slowly... Julie and Henry in silhouette now. 
JULIE Oh, fuck, Henry... The lights fade, as an image of WHITE CHERRY BLOSSOMS appears on the projection screen... 
FADE DOWN : 
FADE UP ON : 
EXT. THE LOIRE VALLEY, FRANCE - DAY 
...which become REAL BLOSSOMS on a CHERRY TREE, widening to reveal an orchard, the most beautiful you've ever seen. 
A STONE FARM HOUSE Frank sits at a table outside in the garden. He pours himself a Pernod. He looks happy as a clam. A CAT jumps in his lap, purring. 
FRANK Hello miou-miou. He looks out at the lush valley below. Smiles. 
CUT TO : 
THE SOUND OF A CRYING BABY 
INT. PRIVATE DELIVERY ROOM, SOMEWHERE IN NEW MEXICO - 
DAWN A state of the art hospital room. No expense has been spared. A shaky image of DEB's face as JOE frames the video camera. THE BABY comes into view now. It's beautiful. And screaming its little lungs out. 
JOE (O.S.) It's a girl!!! 
DEBBIE A girl. 
A NURSE hands the baby to Debbie. Joe looks on, tears stream down his face. 
CUT TO : 
EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE - DAY 
We follow A MAILMAN past a row of palm trees as he enters a traditional-looking BARBER SHOP : "MAX'S - A PLACE FOR 
GROOMING" 
INT. MAX'S BARBER SHOP - CONTINUOUS 
The Mailman hands a few letters to the pretty front desk GIRL. Max, his back to us, finishes a shave, talking his customer's ear off.

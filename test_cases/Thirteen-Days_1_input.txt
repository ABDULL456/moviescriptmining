ADLAI There is a third option.  With either course we undertake the risk of nuclear war.  It seems to me maybe one of us in here should be a coward. 
He smiles weakly, but gets no response from anyone. 
ADLAI (CONT'D) So I guess I'll be.  Our third choice is to cut a deal.  We trade Guantanamo and our missiles in Turkey, get them to pull their missiles out.  We employ a back channel, attribute the idea to U Thant. U Thant then raises it at the U.N. 
Adlai looks for support around the room, but meets only stony gazes.  From McCone and General Taylor, contempt.  Dead silence for a long, long beat. 
Kenny's heart goes out to Stevenson as he watches the man commit political suicide.  Even Sorensen, standing behind him, unconsciously moves away.  At last the President speaks. 
THE PRESIDENT I don't think that's possible, Adlai. (beat, to the room) I will be asking the networks for air time Monday night.  I have not yet made my final decision.  We will announce our course of action then.  I want to thank you all for your advice, gentlemen. 
EXT. TRUMAN BALCONY - DAY 
Kenny, Bobby, and the President lean on the railing of the Truman Balcony, stare out at the city. 
BOBBY Goddman Stevenson.  Jesus.  Peace at any price.  You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two. 
THE PRESIDENT Somebody had to say it.  I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser. 
BOBBY We have to pull him.  He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N.  Zorin will eat him alive. 
THE PRESIDENT We've got bigger problems right now. 
KENNY We have to try the blockades.  It probably won't work.  It may just be delaying the inevitable.  But we can't just go to war without trying not to. 
THE PRESIDENT I don't know.  I don't know. 
He stares out at the Ellipse where a little-league football game sweeps across the grass, the shouts and screams of the CHILDREN, so alive, floating to them on the wind. 
EXT. PATIO - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A crowded D.C. party spills out of Jim Rowe's house onto his patio.  Kenny steps INTO FRAME.  He looks at the PARTYGOERS, the Washington social set.  He stands out, oppressed by the knowledge he's unable to share.  He takes a stiff drink. 
Suddenly out of the house totters Adlai, highball in hand. Glassy-eyed, he grins at Kenny and joins him. 
ADLAI Just can't get away from you guys. Escaping for a night on the town, eh? 
KENNY As the town's most popular playboy, the President felt my presence would be sorely missed.  So in the interests of National Security... 
Kenny shrugs.  Adlai takes a long drink, closes his eyes. 
ADLAI Gotta keep up appearances.  Of course, I don't care anymore.  I'm a political dead man.  You ever seen a man cut his own throat like I did today? 
Kenny has no answer to that.  He looks down, pained for Adlai. 
ADLAI (CONT'D) Well, it's all right. (beat) I came to tell you, just talked to a friend.  Reston and Frankel have the story.  It's going to run tomorrow. 
INT. BEDROOM - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - LATER 
Kenny, shut in the bedroom, paces on the phone. 
KENNY We're not going to make it to Monday. I'll try to lean on Reston, but you're going to have to call Orville Dryfoos. This is the sort of decision the publisher makes himself. 
INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
New York Times publisher ORVILLE DRYFOOS sits at his kitchen table in his underwear, still half-asleep, phone to his ear. 
DRYFOOS Yes, sir, I understand.  But we held on Bay of Pigs and it was the biggest mistake of my life.  What makes this any different? 
INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The President, on the phone, stops pacing by his bedside table and exhales. 
THE PRESIDENT I'm asking you to hold the story until I can present our course of action on Monday night. 
INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
DRYFOOS All right.  But I need a reason to give my boys.  They're going to be screaming for my head on a plate. 
INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
THE PRESIDENT Orville.  I want you to tell them this: they'll be saving lives.  Maybe even including their own. 
INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
At that, Dryfoos sits up.  Serious.  All resistance gone. 
DRYFOOS Yes, Mr. President. 
INT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY 
SUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 21ST.  DAY 6 
AVE MARIA soars over the communion meditation at a crowded Sunday mass.  Kenny, in a pew, glances off to his left. 
The President sits nearby, head bowed.  But Kenny knows he's not thinking about the mass.  And when the President at last lifts his head, Kenny sees the calm poise. 
The President has made up his mind... 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Bobby barges into Kenny's office.  Kenny, knowing his unique entry, doesn't bother to look up. 
KENNY Acheson called, DeGaulle's with us; haven't heard from anyone else yet. 
Kenny finally looks up.  Bobby's grim.  And an icicle forms in Kenny's gut as Bobby relays. 
BOBBY He wants to talk to LeMay again.

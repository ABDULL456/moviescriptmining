AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. 
HONKING outside the nearest window. It's a honk we recognize: 
TRACY ...Is that gonna happen every time? 
MIA (glowing) I think so.

61    EXT. MIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Mia dashes out -- and LEAPS into Sebastian's car and into his arms. They KISS -- giddy, emotional, as though they'd been separated for years. Sebastian drives off -- when -- 
MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) It's one-way!! 
The car SCREECHES to a stop in front of a TRUCK going the opposite direction. Sebastian goes into REVERSE as Mia cracks up laughing. A BURST OF MUSIC as a title card pops on: Revision                          40. 
SUMMER 
The MUSIC carries us through the following series of GLIMPSES: 
62    -- Mia and Sebastian ambling past weathered 30's bungalows in BUNKER HILL... 
63    -- Mia guiding Sebastian down a street peppered with SILENT- ERA HOMES, past old gas-lamps and palms... 
65    -- VAN BEEK. Sebastian gestures to the "TAPAS & TUNES" sign. Excitedly tries to deface it. Mia, aghast, pulls him back... 
66    -- The HUNTINGTON GARDENS, where Mia and Sebastian gaze at the tiny forest... 
A66   -- WATTS TOWERS, where the two lovers stroll and kiss... 
67    OMIT 
64    -- The GRAND CENTRAL MARKET, where they grab food... 
68    -- ANGEL'S FLIGHT at night, where they stumble and slip into a tipsy, love-soaked dance... 
69    OMIT 
Interspersed throughout, WE SEE IMAGES OF LOS ANGELES: 
1940's high-rises, green movie-movie lettering, ochre walls shaded by palm fronds, red flowers and Spanish missions, old lamps and Art Deco hotels. It's a gorgeous city, and the music only makes it more gorgeous -- building and carrying us to... 
70    INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT 
A Lighthouse JAM SESSION. Sebastian's at the keys, having a blast. The place is again mostly empty, but Mia is dancing her heart out. She shoots looks at Sebastian. He laughs, plays out for her. The two of them are in their own world -- one of pure, unadulterated JOY... 
The song ends. Sebastian rises, joins Mia. They sit down as the band strikes up a new tune, and kiss. 
KEITH (O.S.) Sebastian? 
Mia and Sebastian look up, startled. A YOUNG MAN, 35, is standing next to them. Tall, fierce eyes. This is KEITH. 
SEBASTIAN Keith? Revision                       41. 
KEITH Holy shit. Come here, man. 
Sebastian gets up. Gives him a hug. But Mia can sense an unease in Sebastian's eyes. It's a strained hug. 
SEBASTIAN This is Mia. Mia, Keith. (explaining to Mia) We used to play together. 
KEITH                           MIA Hey, Mia.                         Hey... 
Sebastian sits back down. Wants to end the conversation. 
KEITH So how've you been? 
SEBASTIAN Great. You?

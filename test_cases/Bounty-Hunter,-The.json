{"train": "THE BOUNTY HUNTER \nWritten by \nSarah Thorp \nSept 28, 2007 \nFirst Draft \nEXT JERSEY CITY- DAY \nDec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON: \nINT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY \nAn office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners... \nMOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR. Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face. \nINT OFFICE- DAY \nA woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen. MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink- stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have time for office parties, she's working. \nHer door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle. \nCASS I'm working, Stewart. \nSTEWART Come on, take a break. (enticing) I've got Kahlua... \nCass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head. Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering: \nCASS Cassidy Daley. Talk to me. \nJIMMY (O.S.) It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me. \nCASS Depends on what you got. \nJIMMY (O.S.) I've got a confirmed place and time. \nCass is on her feet, excited. \nCASS I love you! So, when? Where? \nJIMMY (O.S.) You think I'm gonna say this shit over the phone? I could get killed. Just meet me at the usual place. Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost an extra hundred. \nCLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff. \nINT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY \nCass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels: \nSTEWART Where ya going? \nCASS Hooters. I go there for the hot wings. \nSTEWART Please. Nobody goes there for the hot wings. You got a tip. \nCASS You got a hundred bucks on you? \nStewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's. \nSTEWART Now are you gonna let me in on it? \nCASS Sorry. No can do. I have to protect my source. \nSTEWART You know what? We need to talk about our relationship. \nCASS We don't have a relationship. We made out 3 years ago in the copy room. I was drunk. I was broken- hearted. I would have made out with the xerox machine. \nSTEWART Yes, but you made out with me. \nCASS I have to go. \nShe exits. He shouts after her: \nSTEWART I want in on that story! \nEXT STREET/JERSEY CITY- DAY \nCass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves: TRACKING A STORY... \nEXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY \nMOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACK CORNER OF THE LOT... \nINT JIMMY'S CAR- DAY \nRACK TO: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT THE CURB. \nINT DARK SEDAN- LATE AFTERNOON \nThe man behind the wheel (DWIGHT, large, babyfaced, Metallica t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car. \nDWIGHT There you are, you dipshit. \nHe takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away from the curb, tailing the Cadillac. \nEXT JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON \nMOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A boys choir singing \"Joy to the World\", the kids dressed like orphans that escaped a Broadway musical. \nA beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing. \nRACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways into a spot just beneath a \"TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY\" sign. MILO climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst. \nMilo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd impatiently. \nMeanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for: \nMILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who does a double-take. \nMILO Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you fucking ding-dong. \nMilo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM. \nDWIGHT We have to stop meeting this way. \nMILO Not now, Dwight. \nDWIGHT You owe my boss money. \nMILO (LAUGHING) Hey, I owe everybody money. \nSuddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up, gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch. \nThe barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL. \nAll of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for: \nMILO (BEAMING) I am so happy you did that. \nMilo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears: \nBOY That man is killing Rudolph! \nSIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over- zealous) steps forward: \nGELMAN Release the reindeer! \nRelease the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles: \nGELMAN Hands behind your head, asshole! \nMILO Take it easy, skippy, I'm just doing my job. \nMilo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes. \nGELMAN Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't you get a real job? \nMILO So I can be like you patrol boys and sit around all day with my thumb up my ass? \nGelman turns bright red. \nGELMAN What did you just say? \nSuddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes one look at Milo and laughs. \nBOBBY Milo Boyd. I shoulda known. \nGELMAN Sarg, you know this asshole? \nBOBBY Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used to be one of us. \nRACK TO- DWIGHT, NOSE BLEEDING, MELTING BACK INTO SHADOW... \nEXT STREET- MOMENTS LATER \nMilo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face. \nBOBBY Look, Milo, I know this is a tough time of year for you... \nMILO This isn't a tough time of year for me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't love Christmas? \nBOBBY ...and I try to be sensitive to your situation... \nEXT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING \nSwearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches. \nSID You gonna give me a hand, or just stand there killing your liver? \nMILO Is that a trick question? \nSid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs part of the tree. \nSID So I told her, fine, I'd handle Xmas this year. I mean, what's to handle? You buy a tree, some gifts, cook a ham, hang some lights. An idiot could do it. \nMILO Well, we'll soon find out. \nSid checks him out. \nSID You have plans for the holiday? \nMILO The usual. \nSID Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and put your fist through a wall? \nMILO Jealous? \nThe tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and Sid pulls out a small hand saw. \nSID Then forget it. \nMILO Forget what? \nSID I've got an open bond, but your thing sounds like more fun. I'll give it to Doug instead. \nSid starts hacking away at the tree. \nMILO Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the fuck. I want the job, I'm in the hole. \nSID You're always in the hole. \nMILO What's your point? \nSID (SIGHING) The truth is, I'm not sure you're the right person for this job. It could be a total disaster. On the other hand, when one friend sees another friend stagnating in his own filth, he has to do something, right? \nMILO Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna shower. \nSid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in. Phew. Sid slams the back shut. \nSID Ok. But remember: you asked for it. \nHe reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick look. A second look. A third. \nTIME STOPS. THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT. \nMILO No. \nSID Yes. \nMILO No. \nSID Yes. \nMILO No. \nSID Are we done yet? \nMILO Is this a joke? Because if it is, I'm gonna have to kill you. \nSID It's not a joke. \nMILO She got arrested? And then she jumped bail? \nSID Apparently the whole thing started with some reckless driving, and ended with her assaulting a police officer. \nMilo gives him a questioning look. \nSID (EXPLAINING) She bit him. \nMilo snorts. \nMILO Yeah. That sounds like her. But here's my question: why the hell did you post her bail? \nSID Hey, I know she dumped you... \nMILO Whoa. She did not \"dump me\". \nSID (QUICKLY) Ok, whatever, I... \nMILO No, not \"whatever\". I dumped her. \nA freshly showered and shaved Milo packs for the job, singing at the top of his lungs: \nMILO Luck be a lady... \nHe puts an empty duffle on the bed and starts filling it: MACE, PEPPER SPRAY, TASER GUN, HANDCUFFS... \nMILO Toooo....NIIIIIGHT! \nHe stares at his collection and smiles: \nMILO (to his weapons) I told you this day would come. \nMilo zips up the bag. \nEXT MILO'S APT- DAY \nMilo tosses the duffle in the backseat. He pulls out the job sheet and inspects it. CASS' CELL PHONE NUMBER IS LISTED. Pulls out his cell phone, then hesitates. He glances around and sees a PAY PHONE ACROSS THE WAY. \nPockets his cell phone and crosses to the pay phone. \nEXT STREET- DAY \nCASS, expensive leather jacket, boots, dark glasses, trying to be incognito. Hurrying towards her car when she sees SOME COPS EXIT A DINER up ahead. She slips into a doorway, waiting for them to pass, when her phone rings. \nShe checks it (\"PAY PHONE\") and answers: \nCASS Jimmy? \nSPLIT-SCREEN \nNope, NOT JIMMY. Milo doesn't speak. Cass listens for a moment. She can hear breathing. What the fuck? An evil grin crosses Milo's face. Cass goes pale. \nMilo takes a step forward. Cass takes a step back. Milo LUNGES and CASS DROPS HER PHONE AND BOLTS OUT OF FRAME. \nEXT PAY PHONE- DAY \nMilo smirks at the receiver. \nMILO You better run, you crazy bitch. \nINT SID'S BAIL BOND'S- DAY \nSid shuts his door, then speaks into his phone, low: \nSID Yeah. He took the job. But if this thing goes bad, I'm blaming you. \nHe hangs up. \nEXT STREET- DAY \nMilo sips from a coffee cup and watches: \nMILO'S POV- THE FRONT DOOR OF A FANCY BROWNSTONE. A woman with a toy poodle emerges from the building, struggling with the heavy door.. \nEXT BROWNSTONE- DAY \nMilo appears next to the woman and holds the door for her: \nMILO Nice dog. Very compact. \nThe woman exits and Milo enters. \nCLOSE ON- PANNING SHOT PAST DOORS: 301, 302, 303... \nINT APT HALLWAY- DAY \nMilo stops in front of 303, and knocks on the door. \nMILO Candygram. \nNo answer. Milo glances around, then works the lock... \nINT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- CONTINUOUS \nMilo slips inside, pulling the door shut behind him. It's dark and quiet. He glides through the room, scoping it out. The place is huge, white rug and couch, flat screen TV. \nAnd lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS, PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a successful and dedicated journalist. \nMilo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left a set of MUDDY PRINTS across the formerly pristine white rug. \nMILO Whoops. \nEXT APARTMENT/BACK DOOR- DAY \nCass enters frame. Nervous looks all around as she tries the knob. Surprise: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. She hesitates. \nINT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY \nCASS (recovering quickly) Oh. No. I'm looking for him. \nLANDLADY Under the sofa? \nCASS Maybe you can help. I'm his girlfriend. \nLANDLADY (SKEPTICAL) You're LaKeesha? \nOh. Whoops. \nCASS Yes. That's my name. LaKeesha. \nLANDLADY Maybe I should call the cops. \nCASS Wait! Ok, look: Jimmy's in trouble. \nLANDLADY What kind of trouble? Money trouble? Drug trouble? (lower) Sex- change trouble? \n\"Sex-change trouble\"? \nCASS Something like that. All I know is, he's missing. \nLANDLADY I've had a lousy week, too. My cousin Linda fell off a cruise ship. \nCASS Oh. I'm sorry. \nLANDLADY Hey. A grown woman outta know how to swim. \nCASS I hear ya. Anyway. Mind if I take a quick look around? \nThe landlady thinks this over. \nLANDLADY Jimmy's behind on his rent. I bet his girlfriend would want to take care of that. \nON CASS- Dammit. \nCASS I bet she would. \nINT CASS' APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY \nMilo explains, as he pokes around: \nMILO The thing is, Stu, she'll make you think she's interested in you, when really all she's interested in is the case you're working on, because she wants to launch her big hot- shot career. \nIt is just dawning on Stewart: \nSTEWART Wait a second: you're Milo. She talks about you all the time. \nMILO (immediately interested) Really? \nSTEWART Oh yeah, dude. She hates you. \nMilo turns an angry red. \nMILO Oh, she hates me? \nSTEWART Yeah. She says you're the most selfish, immature, stubborn... \nMILO (INTERRUPTING) I'm selfish? I'm immature? You know what? Forget it. I'm not even gonna dignify this with...whatever. \nSTEWART Hey, man, I'm on your team. \nMILO No you're not, Geraldo. I don't allow reporters on my team. \nMilo tosses some papers around on her desk furiously. \nMILO And for the record: I'm the one who hates her. Just so that's clear. \nHe picks up the phone and checks the last dialed number: it comes up \"CAESAR'S CASINO\". Milo smiles. \nMILO (to himself) That figures. Run home to mommy. \nMilo erases the number, then heads for the door. \nMILO Well, nice meeting ya, Stu. \nSTEWART Wait, where are you going? \nMILO I'm going to pick up your girlfriend. But don't worry, if she ever gets out of jail, I'm sure you'll be very happy together. \nMilo exits. Stewart hurries to the phone and checks it, but Milo erased the number. Shit. Stewart RACES to the window. \nSTEWART'S POV: MILO EXITING THE BUILDING, HEADED FOR HIS CAR. \nINT JIMMY'S APARTMENT- DAY \nCass is about to give up when she spots, peeking out from the bookshelf, A PLAIN ENVELOPE MARKED \"CASSIDY DALEY\". She slips the envelope into her pocket just as the landlady appears: \nLOIS How dare you...after what you did to my baby... \nLois bursts into tears and collapses into Milo's arms. \nMILO Ok. What say we do this inside? \nINT CAESAR'S CASINO DRESSING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER \nMen running around in gowns and feather boas. A completely recovered Lois sits by a make-up mirror, adjusting a wig. Stuck to her mirror is a PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, SMILING. Milo gives the photo a dirty look. \nMILO What happened to the pirate show? \nLOIS I got sick of it. Now I'm a female impersonator. \nMILO But...you are female. \nLOIS That's why I'm so good at it. Help me with this. \nShe stands and wiggles into an evening gown. Milo struggles with the zipper. \nMILO Where is she, Lois? I need to talk to her. \nLOIS Oh, Milo, where did it all go wrong? Do you have any idea what it means to waste a woman's child- bearing years? It's criminal. Every month her eggs are jumping out of her ovaries like sailors abandoning a sinking ship. I mean, I know you were mad about that article... \nMILO I wasn't mad about that article. In fact: what article? \nLOIS Listen to me, Milo: Cassidy may be a strong independent woman on the outside, but on the inside she's just a girl who wants to be protected and loved by her man. What happened between the two of you devastated her. \nMILO Devastated her right to the top. \nLOIS (BEAMING) She has done well, hasn't she? (MORE) \nLOIS (cont'd) I must admit, it makes me proud to think that my little girl, whose only friend growing up was an imaginary orphan with a tin leg named Leslie, now gets invited to tour the White House... \nMilo's jaw hits the floor. \nMILO She got to tour the White House? \nNow he really wants to take Cass to jail. \nMILO Tell me where she is, Lois. \nLOIS Oh, who knows. She was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, said she was on the biggest story of her career. Said she was going somewhere to think. \nMilo thinks this over, then a grin breaks out on his face. \nEXT CAESAR'S CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON \nStewart has finally found a parking space, and is exiting his car when he sees Milo come out and jump into the Cadillac. \nSTEWART Dammit. \nStewart hurries back into his car. \nEXT ATLANTIC CITY RACETRACK- AFTERNOON \nStands mobbed with people, horses galloping down the track, dust rising in their wake. MOVING IN ON... \nEXT STANDS- AFTERNOON \nSurrounded by people cheering, CASS IS HARD AT WORK. Notebook open, phone to ear, lap holding the plain envelope, ripped open, contents exposed: A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS: \"ATLANTIC CITY. XMAS EVE. SPARROW.\" \nShe has underlined \"Sparrow\" and made a list: \"Person's name? Company? Hotel? Casino?\" \nCASS (into phone) No one with that name? What about a casino? Nothing? Thanks. \nShe clicks over to an incoming call, \"PRIVATE CALLER\": \nCASS Jimmy? \nSPLIT-SCREEN: \nSTEWART, at the mobbed track entrance, lost and frustrated: \nSTEWART No, who's Jimmy? \nCASS Look, Stewart, I'm busy. \nSTEWART Ok. (casually) Where are you, by the way? I mean, exactly. \nCASS I'm in Miami, if you must know. I'm on the beach building a sand castle and drinking from a coconut... \nSomeone taps her shoulder. She glances up and sees: MILO, SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HER, GRINNING. She slowly closes her phone, not bothering to say goodbye. \nMILO Hello, Cass. \nCASS Hello, Milo. \nCASS Chicken shits. \nCass marches back over to Milo. \nCASS Ok, look: let's talk about this. \nMILO Ok. \nWith that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE. BREATHING ON EACH OTHER. THEIR LIPS INCHES APART. \nCass stares at Milo. Is he gonna kiss her? Again, she feels weird. Confused. \nCASS (UNCOMFORTABLE) Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we should... \nSuddenly, MILO DUMPS HER IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR. \nCASS Hey, wait a minute! \nHe smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid. \nCUT TO BLACK. Well, now she knows exactly how she feels: FURIOUS: \nCASS (O.S.) Bastard. \nCHIRON: \"2:00 PM. ROUTE 9 NORTH. 43 HOURS TO GO\". \nAnd immediately: A PHONE RINGS. \nCASS (O.S.) Great. Perfect timing. \nA match is struck, illuminating the trunk as Cass scrambles for her phone. Trying to sound professional: \nCASS Cassidy Daley. \nSPLIT-SCREEN: \nCLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face. PULL BACK a little to reveal the GUN MAHLER IS HOLDING UNDER HIS CHIN. \nJIMMY It's me. Jimmy. \nCASS (exhaling with relief) Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were dead. \nJIMMY Don't be silly. (hurrying on) Listen: you didn't happen to go to my place and find that envelope I left, did you? \nCASS I did, but I don't really get it, what's \"Sparrow\"? \nJIMMY It doesn't matter. Did you tell anyone else about this story? \nCASS Are you kidding? You think I want to share a story like this? \nJIMMY Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there is no story. I made the whole thing up. So you should just drop it... \nCASS Uh-uh, no way are you backing out on me now, Jimmy. This story is way too good... \nMahler nudges Jimmy. \nJIMMY (QUICKLY) Where are you? \nCASS I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex- husband's car. Long story. More importantly, where are you? \nJIMMY I'm... \nCLICK. MAHLER DISCONNECTS THE PHONE. \nON CASS- she stares at her phone. Uh-oh: \nCASS Jimmy? Hello? \nSuddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS: \nMILO (O.S.) Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la laaaa... \nINT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON \nNow Milo really is the happiest man alive. He pulls out his cell phone, dials: \nSPLIT-SCREEN: \nTeresa removes her gum, sticks it on her mouse-pad, answers: \nTERESA Sid's Bail Bonds. \nMILO Guess who's in my trunk? \nTERESA Is that some sort of perverted innuendo? Who is this? \nMILO Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's me. Put Sid on. \n...and she BITES him. \nMILO OW... \nFinally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED. He gets his face right over hers and STARTS TO LET A GLOB OF SALIVA FALL FROM HIS MOUTH TOWARDS HER FACE. \nCASS NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle! \nMilo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing. She looks at him and she starts laughing too. \nCASS Dirty fighter. \nMILO Me? I'm the dirty fighter? \nThey both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as they look at each other. \nCASS Should we...I don't know...hug, or something? \nMILO Sure. What the hell. \nHe opens his arms. She moves closer. They hug. Milo feels her hands moving towards the gun in his belt. He smirks. CLICK. HE SNAPS SOME HANDCUFFS ONTO HER WRISTS. \nCASS Hey. I had to try, right? \nMILO Get in the car. \nINT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON \nThey are driving along, both a little dishevelled, ONE OF CASS' HANDS CUFFED TO THE PASSENGER DOOR. They pass casinos as they head out of Atlantic City. \nCASS Your windshield's cracked. \nMILO Thanks, Captain Obvious. \nCass turns to inspect him more closely. \nCASS And you look like shit, Milo. What have you been doing, sleeping on the floor? \nMilo has been sleeping on the floor. \nMILO I enjoy sleeping on the floor. Matter of fact, I love sleeping on the floor. I love everything about my life. Great job, good friends, hot girlfriend... \nCASS You have a girlfriend? \nMILO (he does not) Yes I do. \nCass is skeptical: \nCASS Really? What's her name? \nMILO (the first name that pops into his head:) Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to cook pasta for me and perform strip- teases. \nCASS Wow. Is she missing a chromosome? \nMILO Oh, she has all her chromosomes, believe you me. \nCass thinks this over, then counters: \nCASS Well, my life is great, too. \nMILO I can tell. You and Stewart make a great couple, by the way. You and me made a terrible couple. But you two? Like peas in a pod. \nAbout to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS. She jumps on this: \nCASS You know what I like about Stewart? \nMILO I can't imagine. \nCASS He's not you. \nMILO Not even on his best day. \nCASS Or his worst. \nMILO I'll bet he has a lot of those. \nCASS Still betting, huh? \nMILO You can't win if you don't play. \nCASS Or, in your case, even if you do. \nHe shoots her a sharp look. She stares back, waiting. \nMILO I win all the time. \nCASS Really? I hadn't noticed. \nMILO (to the dealer) Hit me. \nCASS I'd really like to. \nThe dealer deals the cards. \nDEALER Dealer wins. \nCASS Nice going, master. \nMilo quickly lays out some more money. A WAITRESS (smells like an ashtray) appears: \nWAITRESS And for the couple over here? \nMILO (QUICKLY) We're not a couple. \nCASS (just as quick) Why would you think we were a couple? \nMILO We used to be together. Back when I was young and foolish. \nCASS And I was confused. \nMILO And I was slumming. \nCASS And I was drunk. \nThe waitress looks back and forth between them. \nWAITRESS (BORED) Great story. I have to get back to work now. \nMILO Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating. \nThe waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. Milo turns to see he has lost more money. \nMILO (under his breath) Son of a bitch. \nOk. Cass has had enough of this. She leans closer: \nCASS Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom is in the hospital. \nMilo perks up. \nMILO Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par? \nCASS She might be really sick. That's why I had to jump bail. \nMILO (overly sincere) Taking care of her, huh? Putting aside your career for a loved one? Golly, that's so you. \n\"Golly\"? Cass stares at him, realizing: \nCASS You've already been to see her. \nMILO Impressive. No wonder you got all those awards. So lemme guess: the real reason you jumped bail is cause you're on a story. \nCass narrows her eyes: \nCASS Stewart. Stewart told you. \nMILO (CAUGHT) I would have figured it out on my own, trust me. \nCASS I wouldn't trust you if you were the last man alive. \nMILO You think about that much? Me being the last man alive? Am I naked in this fantasy? \nCass takes a deep breath. This is getting her nowhere. But she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story. \nCASS Ok, you're right. I'm on a story. A very important story. It just so happens that I'm possibly about to uncover a whole ring of dirty cops. \nMilo snorts. \nCASS What? \nMILO Please. Isn't the whole \"dirty cop\" thing kind of old? Maybe you should do a story about something people are interested in. Like internet porn. Or lesbians. \nCASS I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be big. And here's what I'm willing to do (magnanimous): I'm willing to credit you in the article. \nMILO Oh, sure, like you credited me in the 13th Street Article? \nCass stares at him. \nCASS Why on earth would I have credited you? I worked my ass off for that story. \nMILO That's one way of putting it. \nCASS What's that supposed to mean? \nMILO Forget it. I don't want to be in your article. In fact, I would rather eat a bowl of broken glass than have my name in any way associated with one of your lousy articles... \nMilo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out. \nMILO Yeah? He doesn't look like a cop to me. \nCASS (freaking out) Speed up! \nMILO Would you just calm down for a second and... \nCASS NO!! \nCass kicks a leg over and SLAMS HER FOOT ONTO THE GAS. The car LEAPS forward... \nMILO Jesus christ... \nMilo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle for the wheel. THE CAR DOES A CRAZY ZIG-ZAG BACK AND FORTH... \nMILO LISTEN, YOU MANIAC... \nCASS MILO... \nMILO ...LET GO... \nCASS MILO... \nMILO ...NO ONE IS TRYING TO KILL YOU... \nCASS MILO!!! \nShe points past him. Milo turns to see MAHLER DRIVING BESIDE THEM, GUN POINTED AT MILO'S HEAD. \nMILO SHIT!!! \nThey both duck as Mahler starts firing. GLASS SHATTERS ALL AROUND THEM. MILO PULLS OUT HIS GUN and STARTS FIRING BACK... \nEXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING \nBOTH CARS VEER WILDLY FROM LANE TO LANE AS MILO AND MAHLER FIRE AT EACH OTHER... \nCLOSE ON- THE CADILLAC'S REAR TIRE, AS IT GOES FLAT FROM A BULLET... \nINT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING \nMILO GRIPS THE WHEEL AS THE CAR STARTS TO DRAG AND LOSE GROUND. Cass is hunched over in the passenger seat, excited and frightened at the same time. \nMahler pulls alongside them again and Milo WRENCHES the wheel to the left, SLAMMING THE CADILLAC INTO MAHLER'S CAR. Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and FLIPS ONTO ITS SIDE. \nEXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING \nThe cadillac SPEEDS away, leaving Mahler's car behind. \nEXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING \nThe Cadillac is parked on the shoulder, Milo changing the tire, Cass standing by the passenger door, still handcuffed, EXCITED: \nCASS I told you they were trying to kill me! \nMILO Yeah, well, no one's killing you until I get you to jail. \nCass whips her head around to look at him: \nCASS You're still taking me to jail? But it's the cops who are after me. \nMILO First of all: that guy was not a cop. Second of all, we just left him unconscious in a ditch. You'll be fine. \nCASS But...this is important! This is my job! \nMILO And this...(pointing between them) is my job. \nCASS Milo, you don't understand what's going on! \nMilo rolls his eyes and straightens up. \nMILO I'll lay it out for you: some loser with a minor sheet calls you up and says, hey, I've got a big story for you, you interested? It'll only cost you a couple hundred bucks, and I'll tip you onto some criminal activity, it's your chance to expose some bad guys and write the story of your life. Then the moron gets himself caught, he's probably in cold storage somewhere, and now you think the bad guys are after you. (beat) See? I get it. I just don't care. \nMilo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and heads back around to the driver's seat. \nCass watches him closely, getting an idea. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy. \nCASS (CASUALLY) If only I knew exactly when and where this deal was going down. Course, if I can't figure out that part, then you definitely can't figure out that part, because we both know I'm much smarter than you. \nMilo flinches, then forces a laugh. \nMILO Please. My brain can dance circles around your brain. \nCASS I don't even know what that means. \nMILO Case closed. \nSID You are so full of shit. You don't want your job back. You just want to prove you're smarter than she is. \nMILO (instantly heated) I am smarter than she is. I would have cracked that 13th Street case way before she did if she hadn't... \nSID ...cheated, right, I know, you've told me a million times. Did it ever occur to you that a normal couple wouldn't compete the way you guys do in the first place? \nSid spots what he is looking for. So does another last-minute shopper. They both reach for the toy. \nMILO This from the man currently trying to prove to his wife he can handle Xmas. \nSID (instantly heated) I can handle Xmas! \nSid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper. \nMILO Just..trust me, Ok? \nSID Do I have a choice? \nMILO Nope. \nMilo hangs up and gets in the car. \nEXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING \nThe cadillac pulls a U-turn and HEADS BACK TOWARDS ATLANTIC CITY. \nCHIRON: \"6:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 39 HOURS TO GO.\" \nMILO (O.S.) So. Atlantic City. Xmas Eve... \nEXT HOTDOG STAND- EVENING \nMilo buys a chili dog while talking to Cass who stands next to him, handcuffed. \nMILO ...so what exactly are these dirty cops supposed to be doing? \nCASS Stealing evidence from property rooms. Then destroying it, for the right price. \nMilo stares. \nCASS What? \nMILO Nothing. It's just...it's a good idea. If it weren't, you know. Wrong. (continuing) So. Your plan is to catch them red-handed before they can destroy the evidence, then write an expose for the paper and win yourself another big award. \nCASS Something like that. \nMILO Only, you don't know what Sparrow is. (thinking) Could be a nickname. Or the place where the evidence is stashed. Or a code word of some kind. But the guy who knows has gone missing, and you think the dirty cops got a hold of him. \nCASS (NODDING) When Jimmy called earlier, someone else was there. And they disconnected the call. \nMilo is staring at her. \nMILO So we find your source, we find the dirty cops. Gimme your phone. \nShe hands it to him. Milo checks the record of incoming calls and smiles. \nCASS What? \nBOBBY (O.S.) Milo! Merry Xmas! \nSPLIT-SCREEN: \nEXT PADDY WAGON- EVENING \nBobby talks into his cell phone while supervising a parade of hookers being loaded into a van: \nBOBBY Here's one: why did the snowman pull down his pants? Cause he heard the snowblower was coming! \nMILO Funny. Listen, Bob, I need a favor. \nBOBBY Anything. \nMILO I need an address to go with a phone number. But I need it ASAP. Kinda got a guy on my tail... \nEXT GARAGE- EVENING \nA tow truck is pulling up, towing Mahler's car. The tow truck driver turns to Mahler, who is in the passenger seat: \nTOW TRUCK DRIVER The garage is closed for the night. Guess you'll have to wait til tomorrow. \nMahler thinks this over, then SMACKS THE DRIVER ACROSS THE FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS GUN. The driver crumples in his seat. \nMAHLER Guess not. \nMahler leans across him, opens the driver's side door, and BOOTS him out of the cab. \nEXT HIGHWAY- EVENING \nINT HALLWAY- EVENING \nMilo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK. \nMILO (LOUD) Godammit. Son of a bitch. \nThe maid peeks out into the hall. \nMILO (to Cass) This is like the third card they've given me... \nCASS (playing along) Take it easy, honey... \nMILO Don't tell me to take it easy, now we have to go all the way downstairs again... \nCass looks pleadingly at the maid. \nMAID What's the name? \nMILO Davenport. Room 2505. \nThe maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR. \nMILO You're an angel. \nMilo and Cass go inside. \nINT ROOM 2505- EVENING \nMilo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his heels. All is silent. \nCASS (WHISPERING) Wait a second: where's my gun? \nMILO (SAME) I don't know. Where is your gun? \nCASS I don't have one. \nMILO Then you've answered your own question. \nMilo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve. \nCASS Come on, give me something. You've got, like, a million weapons in the jacket. \nShe reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away. \nMILO Hey. These are not toys. You can't just give them to someone and have them know how to use them. \nCASS I seem to remember doing just fine with your taser gun. \nThey are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM. \nNo time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN KICKS THE DOOR IN... \nINT HALLWAY- EVENING \nHalfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the elevators... \nINT ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS \nMilo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room. The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom and peers in: EMPTY. \nMeanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees spots on the rug: \nCASS Oh, god, is that blood? \nMILO Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door. \nCASS I'm just trying to... \nMILO This could be a crime scene. There are clues all over this room that only a trained eye can find. And as I seem to recall, you were the one who was unable to figure this out by herself. \nOooh. Cass grits her teeth. \nCASS (under her breath) He is unbelievable. \nMILO Who are you talking to, your imaginary friend Leslie? \nCASS (BLUSHING) Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary friends, despite what my mother believes. \nMILO Whatever. You wait by the door. And I'll handle this. \nCASS (PISSED) Fine. \nShe moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE. \nCASS So you're saying you don't want my help. \nMILO I'm saying I don't need your help. \nBOBBY Milo, don't fuck around with this. If there are dirty cops in the house, we all have a problem. So do me a favor: get off the strip, find somewhere to lie low and wait for my call. \nEXT BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING \nThe scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly, dangerous Odd Couple. \nAn employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT. Dwight snatches the photo from Ray. \nDWIGHT Yeah, that's him. \nRAY Who's the chick? \nDWIGHT Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they can't be far. \nIt's true. They aren't too far. They are: \nEXT OFF ROUTE 9- EVENING \nA LUXURIOUS, ROMANTIC B&B. Xmas lights winking on the trees, \"Come All Ye Faithful\" gently wafting out the oak front door. \nCHIRON: \"9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO.\" \nThe whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic... \nCASS (O.S.) Ok. Kill me now. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: \"WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN\". Yup. The place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago. \nMILO I'm sorry, it's the only place I know off the strip. \nCASS I'm not going in. What if they remember us? \nMILO They won't remember us. Why would they remember us? Just...try to act normal. \nINT LUXURY B&B- EVENING \nA small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast. The kind of place that prides itself on its service. DAWN (long, graying hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile: \nDAWN Can I help you? (realizing) Wait, it can't be... \nShe looks behind her at a bulletin board. At photos of all the happy couples who have passed through her. And finds: A PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, DRINKING CHAMPAGNE, CASS SHOWING OFF AN ENGAGEMENT RING. \nDAWN (to the back room) Edmund, come quick! \nA balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and clasps both hands to his chest. \nEDMUND Be still my beating heart. \nMILO (LOW) Looks like they remember us. \nCASS (SAME) Ya think? \nEDMUND What a lovely surprise. It's been, what, 3 years? \nMilo and Cass both try to downplay: \nMILO Has it? \nCASS I don't really remember... \nDAWN (REALIZING) And you came back! To celebrate your anniversary! \nCASS Oh, no. No, no... \nEDMUND What an honor for us! \nCASS Actually, we're not... \nDAWN You know what? In light of this special special occasion: it's on the house! \nBefore Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM. \nMILO Honey? Can I talk to you? \nHe pulls her slightly aside. \nMILO (LOW) You have any money? \nCASS (SAME) No, as you recall, I gave you all my money at the blackjack table... (realizing) You blew all the money! \nMILO Hey! I would have won it back if someone hadn't tasered me in the bathroom! \nCASS So. Use a credit card. \nMILO Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours. \nCASS Mine's max'd too. (off his look) What, I like to shop. \nMILO No, I mean, tell me about your attraction to me. \nCASS Um...I can't stop thinking about you. \nMILO Really? What part of me? \nCASS Just...all of you. \nMILO Be specific. \nCass blushes fiercely. If she didn't want that gun so bad... \nMILO (HELPFULLY) My great hair? My chest? Or...something lower like... \nHe reaches down and WHIPS OUT: \nMILO My gun? \nTHE GUN IS IN HIS HAND. That's why she couldn't reach it. HE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO THIS WHOLE TIME. She flips off him and back onto her side. Milo sits up, flipping on the lights. \nMILO I knew I couldn't trust you! \nCASS I knew I couldn't trust you! \nMILO When were you gonna tell me about the matches you found back there in the hotel room? \nCASS When were you gonna tell me you have no intention of helping me with my story? \nMILO (SHRUGGING) You're right. I'm not helping you. This is my story now. This time I get to come out on top! Karma, babe. K-a-r-m-a. Karma.... \nCASS Oh my god, would you get over it already! So I cracked the case before you did, it was 3 years ago, it happened, stop being such a baby and move on! \nMILO Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm moving on? By cracking this case before you, then taking you in so you can spend this Xmas in jail, all alone. \nHe rolls over, turning his back to her. Cass stares at the ceiling, fuming. \nEXT CHARLEY'S- DAWN \nA strip club on the boardwalk. MOVING IN ON THE BACK DOOR... \nINT CHARLEY'S STORAGE ROOM- NIGHT \nJimmy, tied to a chair, watches nervously as MAHLER TAKES EVIDENCE BOXES THAT ARE STACKED ALONG THE WALLS AND MOVES THEM ONTO A MOVER'S DOLLY. \nJIMMY So this is your place, huh? Nice. Cozy. Probably more fun to sit where you can actually see the dancers, but... \nMahler has all the boxes loaded up. He grabs a rag and approaches Jimmy. \nJIMMY Oh. Hey, listen, no need for that, I swear I'll be as quiet as a mouse. \nMahler gags him, THEN PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE. JIMMY SLUMPS OVER. \nMAHLER I know you will. \nMahler grabs the dolly, flicks off the lights, and EXITS OUT THE BACK DOOR. \nINT LUXURY B&B DINING ROOM- DAY \nCHIRON: \"2:00PM. ROUTE 9 NORTH. 19 HOURS TO GO.\" \nCass is in a booth, handcuffed, her mouth set, her face grim. No more Mr Nice Guy. She is scheming her way out. \nRACK TO MILO, SEVERAL PACES AWAY, ON THE PHONE WITH TERESA, keeping one eye on Cass: \nMILO I'm just curious. \nSPLIT-SCREEN: \nTeresa at her desk, sipping eggnog. \nTERESA No, I do not keep my ex's photo in my wallet. \nSid passes through, kids in tow, and carrying A HUGE, TANGLED BALL OF XMAS LIGHTS. Sid looks like he wants to put a bullet through his brain. \nTeresa mouths \"Milo\". Sid picks up the other extension. \nSID What's the problem now? \nMILO No problem... \nTERESA She keeps their wedding photo in her wallet. He wants to know what that means. \nSID It means she's madly in love with you. \nMILO Really? \nSID No, you idiot, it means she hasn't cleaned out her wallet in 3 years. I'm pretty sure I'm still carrying around a condom from 1987. (to one of the kids) Son of a bitch, Jeremy, don't eat things you find on the floor. \nMILO Know where this place is? \nEMT Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk. And just FYI: when they say \"don't touch\" the dancers, they mean with with any part of your body, not just your hands. \nThe EMT folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and THEY DRIVE AWAY, leaving Milo in the parking lot. \nMILO (calling after them, SARCASTIC) Thanks for the ride, by the way. \nMilo starts trying handles of parked cars until he finds one that's open and SLIPS INSIDE. \nEXT ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON \nCass pulls up, parks in a lot, and instantly spots CHARLEY'S GREEN SIGN WITH THE BLACK HORSE SILHOUETTE, squeezed between a burger place and a souvenir shop. She slips out of the car, takes a careful look around, then works her way towards the club. \nINT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON \nPOV OF THE FRONT DOOR, OPENING A CRACK, CASS PEEKING IN. \nCASS' POV- WOMEN DANCING, MEN DRINKING. Seedy and cheesy at the same time. Cass thinks this over, then slowly lets the door swing closed. \nEXT BACK OF CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON \nCass finds the back entrance. THE DOOR IS BOLTED. She is looking for a window to climb into, when she spots JIMMY'S METS' HAT ON THE GROUND. \nShit. Cass stares at the hat: JIMMY IS HERE SOMEWHERE. She presses her ear up against the back door: \nCASS (SOFTLY) Jimmy? \nSuddenly, SHE HEARS GROANING COMING FROM INSIDE. Or grunting. LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL OUT THROUGH A GAG. She looks around. There is a window higher up on the wall. Cass drags a trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of it, and cautiously climbs up. \nThe window is locked and she can't see through it. Hmm. Fuck it. She takes her purse and SMASHES a pane of glass. \nShe wobbles on trash cans and GRABS THE WINDOWSILL JUST AS THE CANS FALL AWAY, LEAVING HER DANGLING. \nINT CHARLEY'S STORAGE ROOM- AFTERNOON \nJimmy is staring nervously up at the broken window. He can see hands and can hear someone cursing under their breath. The top of a head appears, then a face: IT'S CASS. \nRelieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come in. Cass climbs in, drops to the floor, hurries over to Jimmy and ungags him. \nJIMMY Untie me, quick, that psychopath is gonna be back here any second... \nEXT BACK OF CHARLEY'S- MOMENTS LATER \nCass peeks out the door, then gestures for Jimmy to follow. \nEXT ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON \nCass and Jimmy are hurrying to the Cadillac... \nINT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON \nCass and Jimmy climb in... \nCASS So what the hell is \"Sparrow\"? \n...but before Jimmy can answer: \nDWIGHT (O.S.) I have a better question... \nCass looks in the rearview mirror. SHIT: DWIGHT AND RAY ARE IN THE BACKSEAT, POINTING GUNS AT THE BACK OF THEIR HEADS. \nDWIGHT Where the fuck is Milo? \nJimmy almost bursts into tears. \nJIMMY You know what? I think I'll get a real job. Work at Kinko's. Or Burger King. That doesn't sound so bad anymore... \nRAY (INTERRUPTING) Hey. Who the fuck are you? \nJIMMY Nobody. \nRAY Right. So what the fuck are you doing in this car? \nJimmy glances back at them. Do they mean he can just...? \nDWIGHT (spelling it out) Run, you jackass. \nJimmy gives Cass a quick look (\"sorry\"), then exits the car and TAKES OFF RUNNING DOWN THE BOARDWALK. CASS CAN'T BELIEVE IT. She drops her forehead into the steering wheel in despair. \nEXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON \nMilo is driving along in a stolen Volvo, cables hanging under the steering wheel from where he hot-wired it. He is just coming up on the boardwalk when his phone rings. \nMILO (ANSWERING) What do you want, you crazy bitch? \nINT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON \nMILO Don't look around. Just do it. \nCLICK. He hangs up. \nCLOSE ON- THE BOOTH. \nCASS You boys mind if I use the ladies room? \nINT BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER \nCass enters. Milo is behind the door. He SLAMS the door closed after she is in, and blocks her escape. \nMILO You know what my mistake was? I never should have let you out of the trunk. I'm fine, by the way. The doctor said I may have been technically dead for a few seconds, but I'm fine now. \nCass is not impressed. She stares at him coldly. \nCASS So that's what you really think? That I stole information from you? \nMILO It's not what I think, it's what I know. How else did you beat me? \nCASS (as though to a 5 yr old) Did it ever occur to you that I just might be good at my job? \nMilo stares at her. Huh. It actually didn't occur to him... \nCASS That's what I thought. You know what, Milo? You're an even bigger asshole than I previously suspected, and you deserve everything that's happened to you. (beat) And everything that's about to happen to you. \n\"About to happen\"? Milo is just starting to realize... \nMILO You wouldn't... \nCASS (SCREAMING) MILO BOYD IS IN HERE! \nSon of a bitch. The bathroom door SHOOTS open and DWIGHT AND RAY ENTER. They back Milo into a corner. Cass smiles at Milo, waves, and exits. \nEXT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON \nCass comes flying out of the club and runs right into: MAHLER. HE TAKES ONE LOOKS AT HER AND PUSHES HER BACK INSIDE. \nINT BATHROOM- AFTERNOON \nDwight and Ray are frisking Milo, taking away his array of weapons. \nDWIGHT Wow. You always carry this much gear? \nMILO Only during the holidays. \nINT CHARLEY'S- CONTINUOUS \nMilo is pushed out of the bathroom, and comes face to face with CASS. MAHLER APPEARS FROM BEHIND HER, TAKES ONE LOOK AT MILO AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MILO'S HEAD. \nMAHLER Remember me? \nDWIGHT What the fuck? \nDwight steps forward from behind Milo, AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MAHLER. MAHLER REACTS, SHIFTING THE GUN TO DWIGHT. RAY STEPS UP, GUN POINTED AT MAHLER. \nMomentary stand-off. Stuck between the bad guys, MILO AND CASS GIVE EACH OTHER EVIL LOOKS. \nA half-naked dancer appears: \nDANCER Lapdance? \nEveryone looks at her. She is just realizing... \nDANCER Maybe I should come back later... \n...WHEN MILO AND CASS SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKE THEIR MOVES, CASS STOMPING ON MAHLER'S FOOT, CAUSING HIM TO LOOSEN HIS HOLD ON HER, MILO SLAMMING HIS ELBOW BACK ONTO RAY'S ABDOMEN. \nRAY'S GUN GOES OFF AS CASS AND MILO BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. MAHLER REACTS, FIRING AT RAY. DWIGHT FIRES AT MAHLER... \nTOTAL PANDEMONIUM. Girls screaming, patrons running for the exit. \nMAHLER AND DWIGHT BOTH GET HIT. Milo crawls over to a moaning Dwight and recovers his gun. He looks up in time to see CASS DISAPPEARING OUT THE FRONT DOOR. \nEXT BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON \nMilo comes out. THE BOARDWALK IS PACKED, CASS IS LOST IN THE CROWD. Milo raises his gun in the air and FIRES. People duck and scatter REVEALING CASS, climbing into the Cadillac. \nSIRENS... \nINT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON \nCass jumps into the car and hits the gas. She is pulling away, victorious, WHEN THERE IS A SOUND ON THE ROOF. \nMILO'S FACE APPEARS, UPSIDE-DOWN, IN THE WINDSHIELD, GRINNING. \nCASS Get off the car, Milo. \nEXT OCEAN- EARLY EVENING \nThe sound of a motorboat chugging along. \nINT MOTORBOAT- EVENING \nBobby is at the back of the boat, steering. Cass and Milo are up front, explaining: \nCASS So, these guys have a bunch of stolen evidence stashed somewhere in Atlantic City... \nMILO And we think they're ditching it tonight. \nA SMALL YACHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON. Bobby steers the motorboat towards it. MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT COMES INTO VIEW. AND AT THE SAME MOMENT, CASS AND MILO MAKE OUT THE NAME ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT: \n\"SPARROW\". \nBOBBY (CASUALLY) You know, if I was them, I'd store the evidence on a boat, drive the boat about 30 miles out, and blow the whole thing up. \nCass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN AT THE TWO OF THEM. Off Milo's disappointed look: \nBOBBY Hey, man. I got mouths to feed. \nMILO Aw. That's what all the dirty cops say. \nBobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the motorboats engine. \nMilo makes a sudden LUNGE for Bobby and BOBBY CRACKS HIM OVER THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN, SENDING MILO SPRAWLING TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOTOR. \nMilo struggles back up to a seated position. \nBOBBY You've always been such a stubborn asshole, Milo. You just don't listen. All you had to do was stay where I told you and none of this would have happen. Now the two of you are gonna have to go down with the boat. \nINT HULL OF YACHT- EVENING \nCHIRON: \"11:00 PM. ATLANTIC OCEAN. 10 HOURS TO GO\". \nPAN PAST PILES OF EVIDENCE BOXES FULL OF EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE: GUNS, VIDEOTAPES, DRUGS, ETC... \nPAN PAST A PILE OF EXPLOSIVES WRAPPED WITH CABLE AND ATTACHED TO A TIMER, COUNTING DOWN: \"1:59, 1:58, 1:57...\" \nPAN TO MILO AND CASS SEATED ON THE FLOOR, TIED TOGETHER, BACK TO BACK, ARMS STRAPPED TO THEIR SIDES. \nPAN TO THE DOORWAY, where Bobby stands, inspecting the room. \nBOBBY Ok. Guess that's it. Gotta go. (checking them out) You know what? You guys make a great couple. \nBobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone. \nSuddenly, CASS STARTS GIGGLING. \nMILO What's so funny? \nCASS My mom was worried I wouldn't have plans for Xmas Eve. \nCass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES: \nMILO Hey, are you crying? \nCASS (SOBBING) No. I'm not... \nMilo doesn't know what to do. His hands are trapped in front of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder. \nMILO Ok, just don't... \nCASS I'm not crying. \nMILO I know you're not. \nCASS I just...(miserable) I can't believe I going to die by being blown up and sinking to the bottom of the ocean with someone who thinks I'm a total liar. \nMILO We're not gonna die. \nCASS Oh yeah? What's the plan? \nMILO (THINKING) Well... \nMilo looks around. There is a SMALL PORTHOLE IN ONE WALL. Milo assumes a take-charge manner: \nMILO Ok. Here's what we do. We're going to synchronize our efforts in order to cross the room and manipulate the bomb out of the room and into the water in order to diffuse the explosive impact. \nBeat. \nCASS You mean we're going to throw the bomb out the window? \nMILO Uh, yeah. Or we can just wait to get blown up. \nCLOSE ON- THE TIMER: \"1:19, 1:18, 1:17...\" \n", "test1_input": "EXT CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON \nMilo checks his watch, then raps on the door. \nMILO You almost done in there? \nINT CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON \nCass squints at the taser gun, trying to read the tiny instruction label on the side: \nCASS \"Put open end in direct contact with skin. Press button...\" \nMILO (O.S.) Hello? Ok, that's long enough, I'm coming in... \nHe comes in and SHE JAMS THE TASER GUN INTO HIS NECK AND HITS THE BUTTON. HE SCREAMS AND HITS THE FLOOR. SHE SCREAMS, DROPS THE TASER GUN, AND FLEES. \nEXT CASINO- LATE AFTERNOON \nCASS RUNS OUT, BANGS INTO SOMEONE... \nCASS Sorry... \n...and keeps going. She hurries to the curb and tries to flag down a ride. \nRACK TO- SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, THE PERSON SHE BUMPED INTO IS STARING AFTER HER. IT'S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT'S HER. \nCass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and SPOTS MAHLER STARING AT HER. Suddenly, he starts heading towards her. Cass backs up slightly, nervous. WHO IS THAT GUY? \nVOICE Need a lift? \nCass looks around. A trucker has pulled up next to her. Relieved, she quickly climbs on board. \nRACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY. He doesn't seem worried. He turns and heads for his car. \nINT TRUCK- LATE AFTERNOON \nCass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together. \nCASS He says we made a terrible couple. Which is true. I know that. I'm the one who thought that first. I'm the one who came up with that. The fact is, I don't want to be with someone who can't admit he was wrong. \nDRIVER So you're available. \nCass looks at him. He smiles coyly. \nCASS Available for what? \nDRIVER I have a waterbed in my trailer. \nCASS I hope you don't think you're telling me something that interests me. \nDRIVER You know what I want for Xmas? \nThe driver mouths something at her we can't see. Cass leans over and SMACKS HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN. \nEXT HIGHWAY- LATE AFTERNOON \nThe truck SCREECHES to a halt by the side of the road. Cass gets booted out the passenger door. The door is slammed shut behind her. Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off. \nShe turns to see a car headed her way. She starts flagging it down. But wait... Yup, IT'S MILO. Shit. She looks around, but where's she gonna go? Meanwhile, as Milo nears, HE SEEMS TO BE SPEEDING UP. Cass stares. He keeps coming, an evil look on his face. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN HER OVER. \nShe turns and STARTS TO RUN. \nINT CADILLAC- LATE AFTERNOON \nMilo is laughing. \nMILO You better run. \nEXT FIELD- LATE AFTERNOON \nCass runs into a field. Milo drives off the road and follows. He gets her cornered by a pen. He looks triumphant. She scowls. Then she throws open the pen, REVEALING A HUGE BULL. Now she looks triumphant. He scowls. \nCUT TO- BULL RAMS INTO MILO'S CAR, SLAMMING MILO'S FACE INTO THE STEERING WHEEL. CASS LAUGHS. THE BULL TURNS AND NOTICES CASS FOR THE FIRST TIME. \nCUT TO- BULL CHASES CASS. MILO LAUGHS. CASS RUNS FOR THE CAR. MILO LOCKS THE DOORS. \nCASS Hey, it's locked! \nMILO (GRINNING) I know. \nTHE BULL IS SPEEDING THEIR WAY: \nCASS Open the door, you son of a bitch! \nFinally, Milo opens it. She DIVES INTO THE CAR AND SLAMS THE DOOR just before the BULL RAMS INTO THE SIDE OF THE CAR. \nCass and Milo watch, stunned, as the bull looks at them for a moment, THEN TOPPLES OVER, UNCONSCIOUS. Milo and Cass hear a strange sound, and look over to see A SMALL HERD OF BULLS, GETTING READY TO CHARGE. \n", "test1_true": "MILO HITS THE GAS AND THEY FLEE THE SCENE, THE HERD OF BULLS IN MAD PURSUIT.

ROUTE 9 ADJACENT. 40 HOURS TO GO.\" \nINT WAREHOUSE- EARLY EVENING \nLorraine waves Dwight over. \nLORRAINE Ray's got something to show you. \nRAY Merry Xmas. \nRay THROWS open the bathroom door to reveal: A VERY DISGRUNTLED STEWART, HANDCUFFED TO THE TOILET. Stewart blinks up at them, disoriented. \nLorraine hands Dwight THE GOLF CLUB. \nLORRAINE Pick something and break it. \nSTEWART Whoa, wait just a minute... \nDWIGHT WHACKS STEWART IN THE SHIN WITH THE CLUB. STEWART SCREAMS. \nLORRAINE Feel better? \nDWIGHT You know, I do feel better. (beat) Who is this guy, anyway? \nLorraine and Ray stare at him. \nLORRAINE Milo Boyd. \nDWIGHT That's not Milo Boyd. \nRAY He was in Milo Boyd's Cadillac. \nThey all look at Stewart, who moans in pain. \nLORRAINE Both of you go this time, and make sure you get the right guy. I don't have time for this shit. \nRAY AND DWIGHT EXIT. \nSTEWART What about me? \nLorraine considers him for a moment, then SLAMS the bathroom door in his face. \nINT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING \nMilo and Cass are back on the highway, both looking a little worse for wear. Milo's nose is swollen, Cass' clothes are muddy. \nMilo MOVES HIS WEAPONS FROM THE DUFFLE INTO HIS OWN JACKET WHILE HE DRIVES. He smirks at Cass. \nCASS Clever. (noting all the weapons) Wow. You were gonna use all that stuff on me? \nMILO A guy can dream, can't he? \nNOW HIS JACKET IS FULL OF WEAPONS. He turns his attention back to the road. Cass studies his profile. \nCASS Ok, look, Milo, let's just clear the air, Ok? So maybe it was a mistake, thinking we could be involved while working on the same case... \nMILO Hey, I know it was a mistake. Don't think you're telling me something I don't know, cause you're not. \nCASS (deep breath) Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside our differences for two seconds? Because back at the casino, I think I saw someone following me. \nMILO Sure that wasn't me? \nCASS I don't think so. This guy was lacking your trademark smell of booze and KFC. \nMILO Ha ha. \nMilo surreptitiously sniffs himself. \nCASS Anywho. If these dirty cops have my source hostage somewhere... \nMilo starts to laugh. Cass flushes: \nCASS What's so funny? \nMILO You think dirty cops are trying to kill you? Look, I know you think you're hot shit and everything, but I'm pretty sure the only one around here who might want to kill you is me. \nCass SEES A DARK CHEVY in the rearview mirror, gets a look at the driver and goes pale. \nCASS Oh no. \nMILO What? \nCASS Behind us. It's him. The guy I saw back at the casino. \n", "test2_input": "MILO Feels good, doesn't it? \nCASS Feels fantastic. \nMILO A platonic relationship. Working together. \nCASS Helping each other. \nMILO Trusting each other. \nWhich reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. Awkward pause. Then: \nCASS Well. Mind if I shower? \nMILO Ladies first. \nCass disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind her. Beat. Then MILO HURRIES OVER TO THE DOOR AND LISTENS. \nINT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT \nCASS IS PRESSED ON HER SIDE OF THE DOOR, ALSO LISTENING. She reaches over and turns on the shower. \nINT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT \nAs soon as Milo hears the water, HE HURRIES OVER TO THE BED WHERE CASS LEFT HER PURSE. HE STARTS DIGGING THROUGH IT. \nMEANWHILE: \nINT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT \nCass is seated on the toilet lid, HUNCHED OVER HER PHONE: \nCASS (LOW) Hey. It's me. \nMOM (O.S.) Sheryl? \nSPLIT-SCREEN \nMom is at a gay bar, having a cocktail. \nCASS No, not Sheryl. Cass. (beat) Your daughter. \nMOM Jesus Christ, where the hell are ya, Niagara Falls? \nCASS No. You're not gonna believe this, but: I'm at Cupid's Cabin with Milo. \nMOM (GASPING) Oh my god... \nCASS Mom... \nMOM I always knew you two would... \nCASS Mom. We're not back together. \nLong beat. \nMOM Why the hell not? \nINT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT \nMilo is looking through Cass' purse. HE KNOWS SHE WAS HIDING SOMETHING FROM HIM AT THE CASINO. While searching through her wallet, he suddenly stumbles across A WEDDING PHOTO OF HIMSELF AND CASS. \nHuh. He glances at the bathroom door. She carries their wedding photo around? \nINT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT \nCass listens while Mom rants: \nMOM I mean, I just don't get it, you're in this romantic place, you have a perfect opportunity to win him back... \nCASS Why should I have to win him back? He should have to win me back! And who says I want him back, anyway? \nMOM I have never understood this competitive streak of yours... \nCASS (losing her patience) Look, the reason I called: I remember you worked at this one place where they had these bright green matches with, like, this silhouette of a horse on them? \nMOM (immediately defensive) That was a long time ago! And all I did was serve drinks... \nCASS I just need to know the name of the place. \nMOM Charley's. And Ok, I admit, maybe I did a little dancing, but how often do you make 200 an hour in tips? \nCASS I gotta go. \nMOM I want grandkids! \nCass hangs up. She sits for a moment, staring at her phone. Is her mother right? Is she making a mistake right now? She looks around the bathroom. Candles, flowers, thick robes. \n", "test2_true": "Suddenly, on impulse, she grabs the bottle of champagne and two glasses. WHAT THE HELL, WHY NOT? \nThey're here, maybe they should seize the moment. She peeks out the bathroom door and sees... \nINT LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT \nMILO, DIGGING THROUGH HER PURSE, FINDING THE MATCHES... \nMILO (to himself) Sneaky bitch. \nINT BATHROOM- NIGHT \nCass is disappointed and vindicated all at once. She puts the champagne back. \nCASS (to herself) Sneaky bastard. \nINT LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT \nMilo hears the water go off. HE POCKETS THE MATCHES, tosses the purse away and lies on the bed, striking a casual pose. \nCass emerges. \nMILO Good shower? \nCASS The best. \nMILO Great. \nCASS You know what's great? Trusting each other. \nMILO I agree. \nHe holds up the handcuffs: \nMILO Time for bed! \nMUSIC KICKS IN: \"Silent Night\". \nINT LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT \nSNOW IS FALLING OUTSIDE. PAN FROM THE WINDOW, ACROSS THE ROOM TO THE BED, ACROSS A SNORING MILO TO CASS, EYES CLOSED, HAND CUFFED TO THE HEADBOARD. \nSuddenly, CASS' EYES SNAP OPEN. She sits up a little and glances over at MILO'S NIGHT TABLE WHERE HE LEFT THE KEYS AND GUN IN PLAIN VIEW. She smiles... \nINT LUXURY B&B SUITE- TEN MINUTES LATER \nCass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up. She puts a hand on the headboard. She is lifting her knee over him, when he stirs. \nShe freezes, waiting for him to settle. It's like playing Twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out, HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU. \nShe manages to get herself STRADDLING HIM, arms stretched, THE GUN ALMOST WITHIN REACH, when: \nMILO Excuse me. \nCass FREEZES. \nMILO What are you doing? \nShe looks down. Milo is watching her, wide awake. Hmm. This is going to be a tough one to explain. \nCASS Um... \nMILO Are you trying to seduce me? \nCASS (SWALLOWING) Yes. Yes I am. \nShe tries to reach for the gun while they talk. \nMILO (INNOCENTLY) I didn't know you were still so attracted to me. I mean, I remember how you used to like to greet me at the door in nothing but a... \nCASS (INTERRUPTING) Yes, it's true, I'm still attracted to you. \nHer hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it? She stretches more, bringing her face even closer to Milo's. \nMILO Really? Wow. That's great news. You know what would be really sexy right now? \nUh-oh. \nCASS If we both just went to sleep? \nMILO No. If you talked dirty to me. \nThe gun seems to be getting father away. THEIR LIPS ARE ALMOST TOUCHING NOW... \nCASS Ok. (in a sexy voice) Sewage. Mold. Rotting carcass... \n", "test3_input": "Great. So far, so good. \nOnly, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT? \nCASS Did you throw it? \nMILO Not exactly. \nCASS Well, what are you waiting for? \nMILO I'm waiting for a pig to fly in here and grab it. \nCASS (starting to panic again) Milo... \nMILO Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to jump. \nBeat. \nCASS What? \nMILO You know: \"jump, jump, jump around, jump.\" \nCASS Are you serious? \nMILO No. I'm fucking with you. For fun. Just for my own personal enjoyment... \nCASS Ok, Ok. \nMILO Ok: 1, 2, 3... \nEXT PORTHOLE- EVENING \nWe see MILO'S HEAD POP INTO VIEW, THEN DISAPPEAR. \nCLOSE ON- THE TIMER \"00:11, 00:10, 00:09...\" \nMILO'S HEAD POPS UP HIGHER... \nCLOSE ON- THE TIMER \"00:06, 00:05, 00:04...\" \nThis time, MILO POPS UP HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE SEE HIS HANDS... \nCLOSE ON- THE TIMER \"00:03, 00:02, 00:01...\" \nAnd finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB OUT THE WINDOW... \nCLOSE ON THE BOMB AS IT CRASHES INTO THE WATER... \nINT HULL OF BOAT- EVENING \nMilo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still, listening. Silence. \nCASS Think the water defused it? \nMILO Lemme ask you this? Has anything gone our way yet? \nSUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES. \nCass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE. \nCASS Nice job. \nMILO Hey. You, too. \nCASS Thanks. \nMILO Now lets find something to cut these ropes off... \nCASS Think we can catch that cop? \nMILO Trust me: we can definitely catch that cop. \nBecause at this very moment... \nINT MOTORBOAT- NIGHT \n...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind him, and he paddles faster. \nEXT DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT \nMilo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the motorboat. Calling out: \nMILO Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya... \nBobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES: \nMILO What's the difference between a snowman and a snowwoman?

Cass and Milo are seated on a bench, exhausted, watching as THE COPS UNLOAD BOXES OF STOLEN EVIDENCE FROM THE YACHT. Bobby is cuffed in the back of a squad car. \nAfter a moment: \nMILO Merry Xmas. I got you this. \nMilo hands Cass some seaweed. \nCASS You shouldn't have. \nMilo checks his watch. \nMILO Hey. I've still got three hours to get you to jail. Looks like I'm gonna win that bet after all. \nCass' eyes go wide. Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS. \nMILO (to himself) You have got to be kidding me. \nEXT BEACH- DAWN \nLike an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels. Finally, he makes one last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the cuffs. \nCASS (muffled, face in the SAND) I'm not going without a fight. \nMILO Yeah. I'm getting that. \nHe pulls her to her feet. \nINT JERSEY CITY POLICE STATION- MORNING \nMilo leads Cass up to the clerk, both of them looking like a mess. He checks his watch: \nMILO 9am. See? Easy as pie.(nudging Cass) Go on, say it. \nCASS (to the clerk) I'd like to turn myself in. (can't resist) Though I didn't do anything wrong... \nMILO Stop talking. \nCASS ...and I was unjustly arrested... \nTo shut her up, Milo GRABS HER AND KISSES HER. THEN SHE IS KISSING HIM BACK. TIME STOPS FOR A MOMENT. \nThen Milo hands her over to the clerk. \nMILO (to Cass) See ya. \nCASS (a little disoriented) Oh. Ok. \nThe clerk leads her into the jail. \nEXT POLICE STATION- MORNING \nMilo exits. He passes some cops on their way in. ONE GELMAN, THE COP HE INSULTED IN THE BEGINNING. \nGELMAN Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty hunter. \nMilo stops in his tracks. Mentally weighs the pros and cons. DECIDES: \nMILO Ah, what the hell. \nHe turns around, walks back to Gelman, AND SMASHES HIM IN THE FACE WITH HIS FIST. \nINT HOLDING CELL- MORNING \nCass is trying to find a clean place to sit down, when MILO GETS THROWN INTO THE HOLDING CELL NEXT TO HERS. \nCASS Oh my god, what happened? \nMILO Hey. I couldn't let you spend Xmas alone. Besides, I didn't really have any plans other than drinking some cheap whiskey and putting my fist through a wall. \nCASS I'm touched that you would give that up for me. \nMILO Hey. It's the kind of guy I am. \nCass grins. WEDDING MUSIC KICKS IN: \nSID (O.S.) Well, you were right. \nINT WEDDING CHAPEL- DAY \nSid and Lois are watching as MILO AND CASS GET REMARRIED. \n"}

Press button...\" \nMILO (O.S.) Hello? Ok, that's long enough, I'm coming in... \nHe comes in and SHE JAMS THE TASER GUN INTO HIS NECK AND HITS THE BUTTON. HE SCREAMS AND HITS THE FLOOR. SHE SCREAMS, DROPS THE TASER GUN, AND FLEES. \nEXT CASINO- LATE AFTERNOON \nCASS RUNS OUT, BANGS INTO SOMEONE... \nCASS Sorry... \n...and keeps going. She hurries to the curb and tries to flag down a ride. \nRACK TO- SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, THE PERSON SHE BUMPED INTO IS STARING AFTER HER. IT'S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT'S HER. \nCass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and SPOTS MAHLER STARING AT HER. Suddenly, he starts heading towards her. Cass backs up slightly, nervous. WHO IS THAT GUY? \nVOICE Need a lift? \nCass looks around. A trucker has pulled up next to her. Relieved, she quickly climbs on board. \nRACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY. He doesn't seem worried. He turns and heads for his car. \nINT TRUCK- LATE AFTERNOON \nCass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together. \nCASS He says we made a terrible couple. Which is true. I know that. I'm the one who thought that first. I'm the one who came up with that. The fact is, I don't want to be with someone who can't admit he was wrong. \nDRIVER So you're available. \nCass looks at him. He smiles coyly. \nCASS Available for what? \nDRIVER I have a waterbed in my trailer. \nCASS I hope you don't think you're telling me something that interests me. \nDRIVER You know what I want for Xmas? \nThe driver mouths something at her we can't see. Cass leans over and SMACKS HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN. \nEXT HIGHWAY- LATE AFTERNOON \nThe truck SCREECHES to a halt by the side of the road. Cass gets booted out the passenger door. The door is slammed shut behind her. Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off. \nShe turns to see a car headed her way. She starts flagging it down. But wait... Yup, IT'S MILO. Shit. She looks around, but where's she gonna go? Meanwhile, as Milo nears, HE SEEMS TO BE SPEEDING UP. Cass stares. He keeps coming, an evil look on his face. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN HER OVER. \nShe turns and STARTS TO RUN. \nINT CADILLAC- LATE AFTERNOON \nMilo is laughing. \nMILO You better run. \nEXT FIELD- LATE AFTERNOON \nCass runs into a field. Milo drives off the road and follows. He gets her cornered by a pen. He looks triumphant. She scowls. Then she throws open the pen, REVEALING A HUGE BULL. Now she looks triumphant. He scowls. \nCUT TO- BULL RAMS INTO MILO'S CAR, SLAMMING MILO'S FACE INTO THE STEERING WHEEL. CASS LAUGHS. THE BULL TURNS AND NOTICES CASS FOR THE FIRST TIME. \nCUT TO- BULL CHASES CASS. MILO LAUGHS. CASS RUNS FOR THE CAR. MILO LOCKS THE DOORS. \nCASS Hey, it's locked! \nMILO (GRINNING) I know. \nTHE BULL IS SPEEDING THEIR WAY: \nCASS Open the door, you son of a bitch! \nFinally, Milo opens it. She DIVES INTO THE CAR AND SLAMS THE DOOR just before the BULL RAMS INTO THE SIDE OF THE CAR. \nCass and Milo watch, stunned, as the bull looks at them for a moment, THEN TOPPLES OVER, UNCONSCIOUS. Milo and Cass hear a strange sound, and look over to see A SMALL HERD OF BULLS, GETTING READY TO CHARGE. \n", "test1_true": "MILO HITS THE GAS AND THEY FLEE THE SCENE, THE HERD OF BULLS IN MAD PURSUIT.

Stewart blinks up at them, disoriented. \nLorraine hands Dwight THE GOLF CLUB. \nLORRAINE Pick something and break it. \nSTEWART Whoa, wait just a minute... \nDWIGHT WHACKS STEWART IN THE SHIN WITH THE CLUB. STEWART SCREAMS. \nLORRAINE Feel better? \nDWIGHT You know, I do feel better. (beat) Who is this guy, anyway? \nLorraine and Ray stare at him. \nLORRAINE Milo Boyd. \nDWIGHT That's not Milo Boyd. \nRAY He was in Milo Boyd's Cadillac. \nThey all look at Stewart, who moans in pain. \nLORRAINE Both of you go this time, and make sure you get the right guy. I don't have time for this shit. \nRAY AND DWIGHT EXIT. \nSTEWART What about me? \nLorraine considers him for a moment, then SLAMS the bathroom door in his face. \nINT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING \nMilo and Cass are back on the highway, both looking a little worse for wear. Milo's nose is swollen, Cass' clothes are muddy. \nMilo MOVES HIS WEAPONS FROM THE DUFFLE INTO HIS OWN JACKET WHILE HE DRIVES. He smirks at Cass. \nCASS Clever. (noting all the weapons) Wow. You were gonna use all that stuff on me? \nMILO A guy can dream, can't he? \nNOW HIS JACKET IS FULL OF WEAPONS. He turns his attention back to the road. Cass studies his profile. \nCASS Ok, look, Milo, let's just clear the air, Ok? So maybe it was a mistake, thinking we could be involved while working on the same case... \nMILO Hey, I know it was a mistake. Don't think you're telling me something I don't know, cause you're not. \nCASS (deep breath) Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside our differences for two seconds? Because back at the casino, I think I saw someone following me. \nMILO Sure that wasn't me? \nCASS I don't think so. This guy was lacking your trademark smell of booze and KFC. \nMILO Ha ha. \nMilo surreptitiously sniffs himself. \nCASS Anywho. If these dirty cops have my source hostage somewhere... \nMilo starts to laugh. Cass flushes: \nCASS What's so funny? \nMILO You think dirty cops are trying to kill you? Look, I know you think you're hot shit and everything, but I'm pretty sure the only one around here who might want to kill you is me. \nCass SEES A DARK CHEVY in the rearview mirror, gets a look at the driver and goes pale. \nCASS Oh no. \nMILO What? \nCASS Behind us. It's him. The guy I saw back at the casino. \n", "test1_id": 528, "test2_input": "MILO Don't look around. Just do it. \nCLICK. He hangs up. \nCLOSE ON- THE BOOTH. \nCASS You boys mind if I use the ladies room? \nINT BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER \nCass enters. Milo is behind the door. He SLAMS the door closed after she is in, and blocks her escape. \nMILO You know what my mistake was? I never should have let you out of the trunk. I'm fine, by the way. The doctor said I may have been technically dead for a few seconds, but I'm fine now. \nCass is not impressed. She stares at him coldly. \nCASS So that's what you really think? That I stole information from you? \nMILO It's not what I think, it's what I know. How else did you beat me? \nCASS (as though to a 5 yr old) Did it ever occur to you that I just might be good at my job? \nMilo stares at her. Huh. It actually didn't occur to him... \nCASS That's what I thought. You know what, Milo? You're an even bigger asshole than I previously suspected, and you deserve everything that's happened to you. (beat) And everything that's about to happen to you. \n\"About to happen\"? Milo is just starting to realize... \nMILO You wouldn't... \nCASS (SCREAMING) MILO BOYD IS IN HERE! \nSon of a bitch. The bathroom door SHOOTS open and DWIGHT AND RAY ENTER. They back Milo into a corner.

HE TAKES ONE LOOKS AT HER AND PUSHES HER BACK INSIDE. \nINT BATHROOM- AFTERNOON \nDwight and Ray are frisking Milo, taking away his array of weapons. \nDWIGHT Wow. You always carry this much gear? \nMILO Only during the holidays. \nINT CHARLEY'S- CONTINUOUS \nMilo is pushed out of the bathroom, and comes face to face with CASS. MAHLER APPEARS FROM BEHIND HER, TAKES ONE LOOK AT MILO AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MILO'S HEAD. \nMAHLER Remember me? \nDWIGHT What the fuck? \nDwight steps forward from behind Milo, AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MAHLER. MAHLER REACTS, SHIFTING THE GUN TO DWIGHT. RAY STEPS UP, GUN POINTED AT MAHLER. \nMomentary stand-off. Stuck between the bad guys, MILO AND CASS GIVE EACH OTHER EVIL LOOKS. \nA half-naked dancer appears: \nDANCER Lapdance? \nEveryone looks at her. She is just realizing... \nDANCER Maybe I should come back later... \n...WHEN MILO AND CASS SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKE THEIR MOVES, CASS STOMPING ON MAHLER'S FOOT, CAUSING HIM TO LOOSEN HIS HOLD ON HER, MILO SLAMMING HIS ELBOW BACK ONTO RAY'S ABDOMEN. \nRAY'S GUN GOES OFF AS CASS AND MILO BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. MAHLER REACTS, FIRING AT RAY. DWIGHT FIRES AT MAHLER... \nTOTAL PANDEMONIUM. Girls screaming, patrons running for the exit. \nMAHLER AND DWIGHT BOTH GET HIT. Milo crawls over to a moaning Dwight and recovers his gun. He looks up in time to see CASS DISAPPEARING OUT THE FRONT DOOR. \nEXT BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON \nMilo comes out. THE BOARDWALK IS PACKED, CASS IS LOST IN THE CROWD. Milo raises his gun in the air and FIRES. People duck and scatter REVEALING CASS, climbing into the Cadillac. \nSIRENS... \nINT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON \nCass jumps into the car and hits the gas.

Then Milo turns and glares at Cass, and THE LOOK ON HER FACE SAYS SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT'S COMING NEXT: \nEXT TRUNK- EARLY EVENING \nCASS IS BACK IN THE TRUNK. Milo waves goodbye and SLAMS shut the lid. \nIMMEDIATELY, HIS CELL PHONE RINGS. Milo glances at it, then reluctantly answers: \nMILO Yeah? \nSPLIT-SCREEN: \nBobby, ocean in the background, furious: \nBOBBY What the fuck are you doing? I thought I told you to lie low. \nMILO I was lying low... \nBOBBY Yeah? Then how is it that a statewide all-points was just put out on the two of you? \nMILO (SIGHING) It's a long story. \nBOBBY Ok, look, you guys better come to me, I'll protect you til we figure this out. Can you get to Pier 19? \nMilo looks around. He can just make out Pier 19 in the distance, a mile or two away. \nMILO Yeah. \nEXT PIER 19- EVENING \nMilo and Cass drive up in the Cadillac and park out of sight.

Cass and Milo are up front, explaining: \nCASS So, these guys have a bunch of stolen evidence stashed somewhere in Atlantic City... \nMILO And we think they're ditching it tonight. \nA SMALL YACHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON. Bobby steers the motorboat towards it. MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT COMES INTO VIEW. AND AT THE SAME MOMENT, CASS AND MILO MAKE OUT THE NAME ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT: \n\"SPARROW\". \nBOBBY (CASUALLY) You know, if I was them, I'd store the evidence on a boat, drive the boat about 30 miles out, and blow the whole thing up. \nCass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN AT THE TWO OF THEM. Off Milo's disappointed look: \nBOBBY Hey, man. I got mouths to feed. \nMILO Aw. That's what all the dirty cops say. \nBobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the motorboats engine. \nMilo makes a sudden LUNGE for Bobby and BOBBY CRACKS HIM OVER THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN, SENDING MILO SPRAWLING TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOTOR. \nMilo struggles back up to a seated position. \nBOBBY You've always been such a stubborn asshole, Milo. You just don't listen. All you had to do was stay where I told you and none of this would have happen. Now the two of you are gonna have to go down with the boat. \nINT HULL OF YACHT- EVENING \nCHIRON: \"11:00 PM.

Guess that's it. Gotta go. (checking them out) You know what? You guys make a great couple. \nBobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone. \nSuddenly, CASS STARTS GIGGLING. \nMILO What's so funny? \nCASS My mom was worried I wouldn't have plans for Xmas Eve. \nCass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES: \nMILO Hey, are you crying? \nCASS (SOBBING) No. I'm not... \nMilo doesn't know what to do. His hands are trapped in front of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder. \nMILO Ok, just don't... \nCASS I'm not crying. \nMILO I know you're not. \nCASS I just...(miserable) I can't believe I going to die by being blown up and sinking to the bottom of the ocean with someone who thinks I'm a total liar. \nMILO We're not gonna die. \nCASS Oh yeah? What's the plan? \nMILO (THINKING) Well... \nMilo looks around. There is a SMALL PORTHOLE IN ONE WALL. Milo assumes a take-charge manner: \nMILO Ok. Here's what we do. We're going to synchronize our efforts in order to cross the room and manipulate the bomb out of the room and into the water in order to diffuse the explosive impact. \nBeat. \nCASS You mean we're going to throw the bomb out the window? \nMILO Uh, yeah.

Milo is facing the direction of the bomb. \nMILO Now we're gonna work our way over to the bomb. \nThey start moving like a sideways inchworm, creeping along. \nMILO And I don't think you're a total liar, but in my own defense, I was one of the top detectives in my division, I had been working that case for months, and then you just waltzed in and solved it. \nCASS I didn't just \"waltz in\". You know I had been working it for months, too. Isn't it possible that we're both good at our jobs, and I just happened to come out ahead? \nBeat. \nMILO (FUMBLING) Oh. Well, I...(blurting out) Look, I was confused, I had never been in love before! \nCASS Well, neither had I! \nMilo seems surprised to hear this. But before he can respond, THE BOAT ROCKS ON A WAVE AND THEY ARE SENT ROLLING IN CASS' DIRECTION. AS THEY ROLL: \nCASS Ow... \nMILO Shit.. \nCASS Dammit... \nThey are stopped when MILO'S FACE IS SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF THE BOAT. Milo lets out a grunt. Beat. \nCASS Milo? \nMILO (MUFFLED) I'm Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the right, and wait for the next wave. \nThey both start turning separate ways: \nMILO My right. \nThey turn to the right and wait. After a moment: \nMILO So. You were in love with me? \nCASS Of course I was in love with you, why do you think I married you? \nNo response. Behind her back, Milo looks sheepish. Cass REALIZES: \nCASS Oh. My. God. You think I married you so I could get info on the case? Who am I, Mata Hari? \nMilo looks confused. He is trying to figure out... \nCASS She's a spy, Milo. \nAaah. \nMILO (QUICKLY) I know that. Everybody knows that. Mata Hari the spy. \nBeat. Milo clears his throat. \nMILO Well. It might be a little late for this. But...nice job on the article. \nCASS You know, if I had something sharp right now, I would stab you. \nMILO No, really, I mean, it was well- written and... \nCASS Can you just get us out of here, please? \nSuddenly, A WAVE HITS THE BOAT, AND THEY GO ROLLING TOWARDS THE BOMB.

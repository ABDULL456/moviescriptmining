PICARD Who was it? 
GEORDI It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship. 
PICARD What programs were accessed? 
GEORDI That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations.  It's not even restricted material. 
PICARD (to Worf) Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready. 
GEORDI (grim) There's something else.  I was reviewing the sensor logs... (he refers to some readouts on his console) When the Scimitar decloaked there was a momentary spike in the tertiary EM band -- there -- You're not going to believe this but it's Thalaron. 
Picard is shocked. 
INT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT 
Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data. Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible. 
PICARD ... I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical. 
GEORDI Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up.  But he's got it, Captain. 
PICARD As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties. 
BEVERLY It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.  I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc.  A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds. 
PICARD Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat.  Give me options. 
Picard goes.  Data thinks for a moment. 
DATA Doctor, will you excuse us for a moment?  Geordi, please come with me. 
He and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply concerned. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT 
Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard. A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon. 
The door comm chirps. 
PICARD Come... (Beverly enters) ... Beverly, come in. 
BEVERLY You're working late. 
She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc. 
PICARD Remember him? 
BEVERLY He was a bit proud as I recall. 
PICARD He was a damn fool.  Selfish and ambitious.  Very much in need of seasoning. 
BEVERLY He turned out all right. 
He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the distance.  A beat. 
PICARD I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away.  Whatever he's after, it's not peace. 
BEVERLY Is he very much like you were? 
PICARD Yes. 
Data interrupts on comm: 
DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM) Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access.  And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage. 
PICARD (to comm) On my way... 
BEVERLY (stands) Jean Luc -- whatever you were -- right now you're the man you've made yourself.  He's someone else. 
PICARD I wish I could believe that, Doctor. 
He goes. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING 
Deanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her spin: 
SHINZON (V.O.) Imzadi... 
Shinzon stands across from her. 
DEANNA You're not here.

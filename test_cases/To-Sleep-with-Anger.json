{"test1_input": "HARRY (CONT'D) I'll say my so-longs to Gideon before I leave and I truly wish that he will get well. \nSuzie continues to look at the picture. \nINT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nHattie is reading Harry's letters when he appears behind her. Hattie turns but is not surprised or concerned about Harry. She hands him back his letters, looks at him for a moment and goes. Harry looks down at the cracked dish. \nINT. HERMAN'S HOUSE - EVENING (RAIN) \nM.C. and Herman are packing. Okra is all dressed up with a pair of Stacy Adams shoes that make his feet look exaggeratedly long. Babe Brother and Harry are sitting at a table playing blackjack. Okra picks up one thing at a time, making the packing much harder. There is a stack of old dusty 78 record; Okra, trying to step over the records, kicks over a box of mothballs that roll across the floor. Okra has to step over boxes of toilet paper. \nOKRA Why did you buy so much toilet paper? \nM.C. I got that on the job when I was a janitor. They didn't pay me. \nHarry picks up an old cigar box that falls opens. Dice, shotgun shells, some spent .38 slugs and an old rusty knife, a crab apple switch, land on the floor. Harry picks up the knife. \nHARRY Whose old piece of knife is this? \nHERMAN That was my brother's knife. \nHarry gives the knife to Babe Brother and signals him to put it in his pocket. \nThe SOUND of the thunder has an unreal violence to it. \nHARRY I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time. \nBABE BROTHER This would be a bad time for me to leave. \nHARRY We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra? (then back to Babe Brother) Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up. (beat) What would you give to be rich? \nBabe Brother humps his shoulder. Babe Brother looks at his hand. \nBABE BROTHER Had Moms and Pops given me my share of what was mine, I could have been rich by now. Linda and I had it all worked out. \nHarry wins the first hand. \nHARRY I know your mind is on your wife but you should never treat a woman as an equal. You want to get your wife back, get another woman, one of those big hip women that will ride you till you sweat. \nHarry wins another hand. M.C. and Okra are still packing while Herman is eating Argo Starch. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Double the stakes? \nBabe Brother agrees but his thoughts are obviously somewhere else. Harry studies his hand and looks at Babe Brother; he puts down his hand. Babe Brother wins and is quite pleased. The next series of hands are won by Babe Brother. \nHARRY (CONT'D) M.C., you ever heard of a real man having one woman? \nM.C. No, lord! \nHARRY When one woman puts you out, you have another to take you in. You don't drive around without a spare tire, do you? The more mules you have hitched, the easier it is to plough. \nHarry loses another hand and Babe Brother suddenly has a pile of money. \nHARRY Herman, let me borrow a few bucks. \nHerman stand over him with a roll of bills and peels off several. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Bless you. Bless you. \nHerman is standing behind Babe Brother, SINGING to himself. \nHERMAN In the ground there is a hole and green grass growing around the hole. Now in the hole there is tree and green grass growing all around the tree. Now there is a hole in the ground, a tree in the hole and green grass growing around the hole. \nHARRY Let me share something with you. \n", "test1_true": "HARRY (CONT'D) Hattie is a snake. That woman broke up so many homes and caused a lot of misery and because she calls herself getting religion everything is put right. \nOkra is taking several shotguns out of the closet. \nOKRA These damn things are unloaded, ain't they? \nHARRY It's important to know the difference between the incoming fire and the outgoing fire. As Amos and Andy might say, \"We is the outgoing fire.\" Come with us, son. We'll show you some steaming hot juke joints, steaming hot women. \nM.C. A pot full of chitlins and a good time. \nBABE BROTHER Let me go by the house first. \nHARRY We will wait for you as long as we can. I got to get my things from your mother's house. \nBabe Brother hurries out. M.C., Herman and Okra flop down in chairs and on the bed and look at their watches. \nHarry sits at the table tapping out a rhythm on the table and WHISTLING very softly to himself. Suddenly Harry sees that Babe Brother left the pile of money on the table. A look of concern comes over his face. \nEXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN) \nIt is raining hard. Babe Brother gets out of the car. Running to get out of the rain, he slips and falls; he tries to get up but slips and falls again. He gets up and walks slowly up the steps as if he doesn't care whether he gets wet or not. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nSuzie helps him to take his wet coat off. She goes into the kitchen, puts his coat in front of the stove. The knife falls out. She picks it up and looks at it like she would throw it away but Babe Brother takes it. \nBABE BROTHER I need to get my suitcase out of the garage. \nSUZIE What for? \nBABE BROTHER I'm going back home with Harry. \nSUZIE I've heard some foolish things in my life. \nBABE BROTHER Harry is coming to pick me up. \nSUZIE Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling. \nBABE BROTHER I'm busy. \nSUZIE Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction. \nBABE BROTHER Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be. \nSUZIE I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough. (forcefully) You sit right there with your no manners self. \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN) \nJunior is carrying a roll of roofing paper. Pat, Rhonda, Linda and Sunny run to the porch to get out of the rain. Junior stacks the roofing paper in the corner of the porch and stamps the mud off his shoes. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nJunior, Pat, Linda and Rhonda come in to help Suzie move the bed from under the rain dripping through the hole in the ceiling. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) \nSunny stands in the doorway watching his father sharpen his knife that he got from Harry. Babe Brother is unaware that his son is watching him. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nJUNIOR Where is Babe Brother? \nSUZIE Brother is in the kitchen. \nJUNIOR How come you didn't ask Babe Brother to help you? \n", "test1_id": 1818, "test2_input": "SUZIE He said he was busy. He is mad 'cause he wanted to get in the garage to get his things so he could go with Harry. \nLinda has a surprised look on her face. \nJUNIOR So he is busy? \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) \nBabe Brother is preoccupied sharpening his knife with a sharpening stone. He is almost in a trance. Junior comes in rather angrily. Sunny goes and sits in the shadows in the dining room. \nJUNIOR Why in the hell didn't you help mama? \nBABE BROTHER I told her I would if she would give me time. \nJUNIOR I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house. \nBABE BROTHER You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof. \nJUNIOR That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up. \nBABE BROTHER I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain. \nJUNIOR I ought to break your damn neck. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nSunny is sitting in a chair listening to his father and uncle argue in the kitchen. A car outside passes and the lights from the car form a crochet-like moving pattern on the wall behind him. Sunny is only lit for a moment. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) \nBabe Brother starts gathering up his things to leave. \nBABE BROTHER I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name? \nJUNIOR You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother. \nBABE BROTHER My name is Sam. Samuel. \nBabe Brother attempts to get up but Junior pushes him down. \nJUNIOR Sit down! \nBabe Brother hits Junior on the jaw, driving him backwards, causing the overhead lamp to sway violently. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nSuzie, Pat and Linda hear the noise coming from the kitchen and rush to see what is going on. \nINT. KITCHEN - RAINY NIGHT \nBabe Brother and Junior are both reaching for the knife. Junior is on top of Babe Brother, who is stretched out on the table trying to reach the knife. Junior grabs the knife first and Babe Brother flips over to defend himself. Babe Brother grabs Junior's wrist as Junior tries to push the knife against his throat. \nSuzie comes in and grabs part of the knife with her hand and Junior's wrist with her other hand. Pat and Linda try to pull the two men apart while pleading with Junior. \nBlood drips from Suzie's hand to the table, forming a pool under Babe Brother's head. \nPAT Stop it! Stop it! Look what you are doing! \nBabe Brother's eyes are rolled to the back. Junior's eyes are huge; he has an animal look on his face. The SOUND of struggling people breathing heavily is amplified. The pool of blood on the table grows larger. \nJunior slowly becomes aware of the blood and his body relaxes. He calmly releases the knife. \nJunior takes his mother's hand. \nJUNIOR Someone get some lard out of the ice box. \n", "test2_true": "Junior holds his mother's hand under the faucet. It is a deep cut. The bleeding won't stop. \nPat is sitting at the blood-stained table unable to move. She is PANTING, sweating, and holding her stomach. Linda is caught between trying to help Suzie and attending to Pat. \nBabe Brother helps to make a wad of cloth to press in her hand to Stop the bleeding. \nLINDA You are going to need some stitches. We better take her to the emergency hospital. \nBabe Brother is shamefully calm now and very humble. \nBABE BROTHER I'll drive her to the hospital. \nJUNIOR We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad. \nLINDA What about Pat? \nPAT I'm okay now. \nSuzie attempts to go see Gideon but Babe Brother and Junior turn her to the door. Going through the kitchen door, Junior intentionally turns his back to Babe Brother. Babe Brother stares at Junior's back as he walks ahead. \nINT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nThe automatic doors open and Junior, Babe Brother and Suzie enter. There is a long line of people waiting at the registration window as well as groups of people filling out forms. Other patients are seated and waiting patiently to see the doctor. \nSuzie finally gets to the registration window. A NURSE, white, 25, with extremely long fingernails that curve back around, is surprisingly sympathetic. \nNURSE What sort of emergency are you here for? \nSUZIE I cut my hand. \nNURSE Let me take a look at it. \nSuzie puts her hand through the window. The Nurse stands up to get a better look. The Nurse takes the wad out of her hand. The bleeding has stopped. The Nurse takes a deep breath. The Nurse glances up to notice the blood stains on the back of Babe Brother head. \nNURSE (CONT'D) Are you all together? \nJUNIOR Yes. \nNURSE The bleeding has stopped but it will need stitches. You will have to fill out this form. How will this be covered, insurance, cash or check? \nJUNIOR Don't worry about it. It will be paid. Just let her see a doctor. \nSUZIE I have Medicare. \nThe Nurse hands Suzie a form, but Babe Brother takes the form. The Nurse looks again at Babe Brother's head. \nNURSE Do you need to see the doctor too? \nBABE BROTHER No, just my mother. \nBabe Brother fills out the form with Suzie's help and hands the form back to the Nurse. \nThey find a seat all together. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nThe room slowly fills with people and Babe Brother and Junior offer their seats to those there for medical care. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nTwo Police Officers bring in a man handcuffed to a bed. The woman officer carries a shotgun. The male police officer carries a clip board. The Prisoner is obviously in no condition to escape or cause trouble. They are allowed to go directly to the emergency room without waiting. \n", "test2_id": 1819, "test3_input": "JUNIOR He slipped on some marbles that were on the floor. Then his heart gave out. \nLINDA (to Sunny) I told you to always put those marbles up and not to leave them just anywhere. \nPAT The poor thing is not to blame. Rhonda, take Sunny for a walk. \nMarsh hands Rhonda several dollars. \nMARSH Here, go around to the store and buy what you want. \nHATTIE Would anybody object if I take a look at him? \nHERMAN I don't think Harry would like it. \nHattie goes over and pulls the blanket back. Okra, M.C. and Herman hurry over to take a quick glance. They huddle behind Hattie, peeping over her shoulder. \nHATTIE I never noticed how big his eyes were. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. BATHROOM - EVENING \nLinda is helping Babe Brother wash Suzie's blood out of his hair. She dries his hair with a towel. Sonny hands Babe Brother a clean shirt, Gideon's shirt. He puts it on. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGideon is sitting on the edge of his bed looking through the scraps of leftovers on his plate. He puts his pants on. As he moves about, his joints SNAP and POP. He picks up the empty plate. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT \nBabe Brother is on the phone with the county morgue. He gets into an argument with the people on the other end of the phone. \nBABE BROTHER Mister... Mister... Excuse me for cutting you off but we pay taxes too. We should not have to pay you to take a 24-hour lunch break. \nBabe Brother hands the phone to Linda. \nBABE BROTHER (CONT'D) The coroner said that he was out here, and knocked on the door and no one was here. \nJunior steps over the body, holding a pot of coffee in his hand. \nThe Preacher is sitting with Suzie talking in a low voice. \nPat, Rhonda and Sunny come in with boxes of chicken snack. \nLinda hangs up the phone. \nLINDA He doesn't know when he will be out this way again. Somebody downtown is going to hear about this. \nM.C. They just do that in the colored neighborhood. If he had been white, they would had him on his feet and out of here. \nPAT I got white meat and I got dark meat. I know it sounds cruel but we have to eat. \nGideon comes in walking very slowly, holding his plate out. Everyone is shocked. Gideon is completely unaware of the period that he has been sick. \nGIDEON What, are you having another party? \nSUZIE You better come sit down. You are still sick. \nGIDEON Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick? \nJUNIOR You have been out for almost three weeks. \nThe Preacher gives him a pat on the back and shakes Gideon's hand. \nPREACHER We had long conversations with the Lord about you. Didn't we, Sister Suzie? I said we need him down here, Lord. \n", "test3_true": "OKRA That's our friend Harry. \nGIDEON Not our Harry? \nOKRA I wish it wasn't. \nGideon seems to weaken for a moment. \nGIDEON What happened to him? \nHATTIE He dropped dead. \nHERMAN Hattie, you can be so mean. \nGIDEON How long has he been dead? \nSUZIE Since this morning. \nGIDEON What happened to your hand? \nSUZIE I cut it on an old rusty knife. \nGideon is deeply concerned. \nGIDEON What did you put on it? \nSUZIE It's healing now. \nGideon looks over at his two sons as if to ask them about it. \nGIDEON I hope you will take care of your mother better than that when I'm gone. \nJunior and Babe Brother both have their heads down. Linda and Sunny move closer to Babe Brother. \nGIDEON (CONT'D) Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing? \nBABE BROTHER Yes. \nGIDEON How come you're not wearing my shoes? \nBABE BROTHER They're too big. \nGideon stares at Babe Brother and then looks around towards Harry. \nGIDEON When is the undertaker coming? \nLINDA They can't say. I'll try calling them again. \nHattie moves closer to Herman and speaks so only he can hear. \nHATTIE Why don't M.C. and you drag him to your house? \nHerman moves away with a look of disdain. \nMARSH Harry didn't have any relatives living, did he? \nM.C. Harry was in the world by himself. \nMARSH Somebody has to take responsibility for him. \nPAT Why don't you look through his things to see if you can find a number? \nOkra, Marsh, Hattie, Herman, and M.C. go to Harry's room, leaving Suzie and Gideon sitting opposite each other with the door to the kitchen separating them. Junior, the Preacher and Pat are eating chicken. Linda is on the phone trying to get through to the morgue. \nLINDA How do you like that? They hung up in my face. I'll fix them. I'll show them just how mean I can get. \n", "test3_id": 1820}

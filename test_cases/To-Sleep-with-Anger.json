{"train": "To Sleep With Anger \nINT. ROOM - DAY  (EFX) \nGIDEON, a strongly built elderly black man, is sitting at a table. On the table is a large bowl of fruit. A crocheted tablecloth hangs over the side of the table. Gideon is dressed in a white suit and wearing a pair of well-polished wing-tip shoes. His hat almost covers his eyes, which are two points of greenish coals. The fruit in the bowl is engulfed in flames. \nThe flames look as if they are DRIPPING from the tablecloth to the floor. Gideon's shoes start to SMOULDER. His shoes BURST INTO FLAMES which spread up his pants leg. His head falls forward as if he had suddenly fallen to sleep. He twiddles his thumbs very slowly in a circle. He crosses his legs as if to get comfortable. \nThe camera moves to a CLOSE UP of his burning shoes. The image of his feet begins to appear through his shoes; the flames fade; the background changes as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GIDEON'S BACKYARD - DAY \nGideon's bare feet are resting on reddish dry earth. Gideon is sitting in his backyard under a fruit tree with a Bible resting in his hands. \nHis house is a small, neatly painted bungalow in South Central Los Angeles. Corn, tomatoes, other vegetables grow in the yard. Chickens scratch around. \nHe slowly awakens; his hands are trembling. He looks around and sees the chickens. He looks up at the sky and sighs, with some relief. \nSUNNY, Gideon's grandson, five years old, has been watching him from the back window of the house. He leaves the window. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nDOLLY SHOT OF SUNNY \nSunny peeps in the workroom. Through the crack in the door, a Woman waves to Sunny. \nINT. WORKROOM - DAY \nThe room is nearly filled with pregnant women and their husbands. SUZIE, Gideon's wife, late 60's or early 70's, a picture of health, is giving a last bit of instruction before the class ends. Some of the people are already preparing to leave. \nSUZIE Remember, especially you men, that working together now will already have formed a bond before the child arrives. The woman is very sensitive. \nSomewhere in the room a Male Voice booms out. \nVOICE (O.S.) Tell me about it. \nThere is a bit of LAUGHTER as all start putting away their things. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nGideon looks over at the chickens, scratching around in the garden. He calls to them, but they don't respond. He puts his shoes on and walks towards the back door of the house. Entering the house, he stops and waits inside the door peeping out. In a sort of devilish manner he talks to himself. \nGIDEON Spoiling the little foxes that spoil my vines. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nShot of the backyard. Nothing. Suddenly, with the grace and suspicion of alley cats, kids jump over Gideon's back fence, look around timidly, and start climbing up his fruit tree. \nGideon walks down the steps slowly while humming in a deep voice. He turns the water on and walks over to the tree, trapping the kids. Dangling legs, hanging from the tree, try to scurry up the tree to safety. Gideon sprays the tree with water. Wet kids fall out of the tree and in one motion leap the fence. Gideon cuts the water off and slaps the dirt off his hands. He is quite pleased with himself. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY \nOne of the wet kids is watching Gideon as he goes back inside the house. The boy signals the others who slowly follow in single file. They jump the fence and climb back up the tree. They let their half-eaten fruit fall to the ground. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nSuzie opens a letter and a picture of a baby falls out. Suzie looks at the picture before reading the letter. She tries to find a place for it among the other baby pictures that cover the entire mirror on the dresser. Gideon comes in and starts to undress. \nGIDEON My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now? \nSUZIE Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom. \nRHONDA, Gideon's granddaughter, 13 years old, comes out of the bathroom. \nGIDEON What can I do for you, Officer? \nSuzie returns to the kitchen to clean the egg on the floor. Officer Scott keeps her in view. \nDAVIS You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock. \nGIDEON I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots. \nDAVIS Not anymore, not in the city. \nGIDEON We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have. \nDAVIS Well, you just have to move further out. \nGIDEON Now how far would further out be? \nDAVIS I'm not here to argue, sir. \nSCOTT You guys don't make anything illegal, do you? \nGIDEON Like what may I ask? \nSCOTT You might have a distillery pumping out barrels of moonshine. \nSuzie looks at Scott for a moment and goes into the kitchen. Gideon is about to lose control. Davis heads off the confrontation. \nDAVIS Look, just get rid of the chickens and you all have a nice day. \nGideon stands in the doorway watching the Police go down the steps. \nGIDEON I'll be damned if I get rid of my chickens. I ought to get some hogs and put them out there. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT \nThere is soft knocking on the door. Suzie enter frame wearing a robe. \nSUZIE Who is it? \nBABE BROTHER (V.O.) Babe Brother. \nSuzie opens the door. BABE BROTHER, Gideon's youngest son, about 31, handsome, wearing an expensive suit, comes in, beating the cold off of him and blowing in his hands. \nBABE BROTHER I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night. \nSUZIE This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air. \nBABE BROTHER He will be alright. \nThe camera follows Babe Brother. He passes Gideon's room where Gideon is asleep, snoring loudly. \nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSuzie and Babe Brother enter the bedroom where Sunny is sleeping. Suzie gives Babe Brother a blanket to wrap Sunny up in. \nBABE BROTHER Thanks for taking care of him. I will try not to be so long next time. \nBabe Brother gives his mother a good-night kiss. Gideon comes to the door. \nGIDEON What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one. \nBABE BROTHER I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late. \nGIDEON That's a lie. \nSUZIE Let us settle this tomorrow. \nBABE BROTHER He wouldn't want any if you didn't try to keep it away from him. \nLinda leaves the table but stops for a moment and looks down at her husband. \nLINDA Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny. \nBABE BROTHER My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did. \nLINDA I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it. \nBABE BROTHER What is a sip of coffee going to do? \nLINDA Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child. \nBABE BROTHER I don't see you crying about my drinking it. \nLINDA How old are you? \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nA SLOW CLOSE UP DOLLY SHOT OF SUZIE'S HANDS DROPPING SEEDS IN THE GROUND. \nGideon is raking out the chicken coop. He puts the rake down and walks over to the garden and watches Suzie plant seeds for a while. \nGIDEON Instead of standing here doing nothing, I better give those chickens some scratch before they start cackling. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY \nOLD JOHN is pushing his cart up the alley. Old John's face is washed so clean that it shines. His pants are dirty and his cart is full of odds and ends of no value. He looks to be about seventy and fit. Old John throws a sack on Gideon's fence. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nSuzie,is bent over a plant that she is tying to a stick. She looks up and sees the sack on the fence. A smile appears on her face. She goes over to the fence. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY \nOld John is about to take up his journey when Suzie sticks her head over the fence. \nSUZIE How are you? \nOLD JOHN Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses. \nSUZIE It is so considerate of you. \nGideon sticks his head over the fence. \nGIDEON Well, well, look who is taking up all the sunshine. Brother John, how are you doing? \nOLD JOHN I'm still here. \nSuzie leaves the two men talking. \nGIDEON Tell me something. How do you get energy to stay on the move all day? \nOLD JOHN You couldn't sit on your rump under my daddy's roof. No sir. If you couldn't outwork his mule, you wasn't worth the salt you put in greens. You had to wake up looking for something to do. I was raised as a mule and now I'm a rolling stone. \nSuzie sticks her head over the fence and hands a bag of red tomatoes to Old John. \nOLD JOHN (CONT'D) I didn't mean for you to pay me for that. \nSUZIE I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful. \nOLD JOHN But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them. \nSUZIE I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nBabe Brother's car, a new Audi, is parked out front. \nLinda is in the front seat reading a magazine while Sunny is asleep in the back seat. Babe Brother sticks his head in the window. \nBABE BROTHER Why don't you come in for a while? \nLINDA I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSuzie, Gideon, Junior, Pat and Rhonda are still at the table eating. \nSUZIE You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them. \nGIDEON Babe Brother is a poor boy. \nJUNIOR You all should have been hard on him like you were me and he wouldn't be the way he is. \nSUZIE Everybody got the same. I breast fed him like I breast fed you. \nPAT Junior, you are wrong. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nBABE BROTHER Just for a minute. \nA dirt rock HITS the front windshield. Linda lets out a little scream. Babe Brother looks around. Skip is on top of the roof next door. \nSKIP I didn't mean to hit your car. I was throwing at my birds. \nINT. FEED STORE - DAY \nGideon is looking at the price of laying mash. He digs his hand into a barrel of scratch. Sunny also digs his hand in the barrel. \nSuzie is looking at new young plants. She gives the vegetables a thorough going-over. \nGideon is standing in line waiting to place his order. \nGIDEON I need about five pounds of laying mash and you better give me about the same of scratch. \nWhile at the counter, Gideon turns and looks around at the prices of different items. Suzie brings her plants and puts them on the counter. \nGIDEON (CONT'D) When are you going to have a sale on weed killer? \nCASHIER You missed it. We had a two-day sale last week. \nGIDEON What kind of a sale is a two-day sale? I thought sales last a week or two. \nCASHIER Every day we have something different. Today's sale is hay. 25% off. If you have a horse or cow, you're in business. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nSunny looks at the Little Girl in the next car; she has her mouth pressed against the window. She is missing a tooth. Gideon is behind the wheel while Suzie holds her new plants up to the sun, carefully looking at them. \nSunny, seated in the back, pokes a hole in the sack of feed. The mash trickles to the floor as if from an hour glass. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSuzie is sitting in front of a table full of jars. Each jar has a shoot and is half-filled with water. Gideon is on his knees trying to fix the hinge to a cabinet. Sunny is sitting almost under him listening to him tell stories. Sunny has a coffee can full of marbles. \nGIDEON All of the preachers were down in the basement of the church confessing their sins to one another. They were way down in the basement 'cause they figured no one would hear them. One of the preachers said, it makes me feel too shame to tell how bad I have been. You know them young gals that sit up in the first row. I can look at them and forget my text. I'm just lost when it comes to women, even them middle age sisters. Then another preacher said, I don't think I can tell you what my sin is 'cause it's bad. Another preacher said, Brother, we all amongst friends. Tell us what's troubling your soul. Clear your conscience. \nGideon takes a sip of water. \nHARRY Well, I don't want to put you out. \nGIDEON Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out. \nHARRY Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nThe bedroom door to Harry's room is cracked open. Peering through the cracked door, we SEE Harry asleep on his pallet. His back is turned to the camera. It is dead silent. There does not seem to be any sign of life. On the floor is a plate that has water in it. It looks like it is for a dog. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSuzie is peeling potatoes and Gideon is ironing. \nSUZIE Poor old Harry, he really must have been worn out. He has been asleep all day. \nWithout anyone being aware, Harry has been standing in the doorway for some time. \nHARRY Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary. \nSUZIE You should go back and rest. \nHARRY No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit? \nGIDEON Man, act like this is your home. \nHARRY That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome. \nSUZIE One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are. \nHARRY Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place. \nGIDEON You had to tread softly. \nThe doorbell rings and Gideon goes to answer it. \nSUZIE Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person. \nHARRY You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say \"go on in there brick and hit somebody\" and it would find its mark. \nSUZIE I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him. \nHARRY All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is. \nGideon comes back with Junior, Pal and Rhonda. \nGIDEON Harry, I would like for you to meet my oldest son, his wife and daughter. \nJUNIOR Pleased to meet you. So you're from back home, too. \nHarry and Junior shake hands, but Rhonda gives Harry only a nod of her head and a smile. \nPat, who is pregnant, attempts to shake hands with Harry, but is forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in her stomach. \nPAT This boy must be turning over. Oh, he just kicked me again. \nJunior feels her stomach. Pat again tries to shake Harry's hand and again gets a jolt from her stomach. She finds a chair to sit down in. \nThe SOUND of rocks hitting the roof causes everyone to look up. \nGIDEON It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window \nHARRY I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me. \nINT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY \nEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON \nGideon is standing with his hat in his hand. His posture is that of an extremely old man. \nGIDEON In weather like this, you cannot walk around bare-headed. \nHe wipes the sweat from his hat band. \nHARRY We'll go a little farther. The walk will do us some good. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSuzie is peeling apples while Sunny, standing next to her, catches peelings in his mouth. Pat is sitting next to the window. She is uncomfortable. She loosens her pants, giving her stomach more room. Rhonda is leaning over the back of the chair with her arms around Pat's neck. They are in silhouette. \nPAT Did you do your homework? \nRHONDA Yes. (beat) Mama? \nPAT What? \nRHONDA Can I name the baby? \nINT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nSuzie knocks on the door. Harry comes to the door still buttoning his shirt. \nSUZIE I have someone I want you to meet. \nHARRY I'll be right there. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY \nGideon in the background in the kitchen washing off the vegetables. Suzie and HATTIE are sitting at the table. Harry comes in and is surprised to see Hat tie. Hattie is in her late sixties but looks well. She makes a conscious effort to dress plainly. \nHATTIE I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been? \nHARRY Girl, do you still sing and dance? \nHATTIE No, I'm a different person now, Harry. \nHattie has a nervous condition that causes her to squint from time to time. Gideon comes in from the kitchen. \nGIDEON Haven't the years been good to Hattie? \nHARRY It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life. \nHATTIE Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now. \nHARRY Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road. \nHATTIE Some people grow up and change their ways. \nHARRY I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers. \nHATTIE My mother passed on years ago. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY \nM.C. slams the door to his car and hurries up the steps, leaving HERMAN, in spite of his bad condition, to get out of the car the best he can. The car door almost knocks poor Herman over. M.C. seems rather youthful because of his energy and awkwardness. He is a large muscular man. \nHerman is a dried-up man with nothing, not even a shadow. He has a racking COUGH. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY \nM.C. gives Gideon a bear hug, lifting him off his feet. On seeing Suzie, he drops Gideon and rushes over to lift her up off her feet. \nHATTIE You know the saying, \"your heart is in your left hand.\" \nHARRY Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some. \nHATTIE I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it. \nHARRY \"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly.\" \nM.C. You ain't going to win playing the dozens with Harry. \nHERMAN You all ought to get along. \nHATTIE Harry, you know you remind me of so much that went wrong in my life. When I heard you were here, I made a special effort to come and see you. I see you are still a pile of wet chicken feathers. \nHERMAN Oh Lord. \nHARRY My sister, women can get away with so much. I don't have any enemies 'cause I don't live in the past. As Pushkin, you don't know him, said, \"In the hope of glory and good, I look without fear ahead.\" \nM.C. Harry has got your number. \nHATTIE An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens. \nHARRY Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry. \nHERMAN I don't have too many fish fries left. \nHARRY We can have it here next week. \nHATTIE Is this your house? \nHARRY Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say? \nGIDEON Well, it's up to Suzie. \nSUZIE It would be nice. \nHATTIE In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog. \nHARRY I already have, my dear. \nHERMAN Please, M.C., take me home. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe children of the women in Suzie's natural birth group are huddled together SINGING \"Ashiine Ca Chew\". The voices of the women in the next room are audible. The kids go outside to sit on the porch. \nINT. HOUSE, WORK ROOM - DAY \nMost of the women have their newborns with them and are engaging in talk about how their other children had to adjust and etc. \nA young white mother, REBECCA WILSON, with both her children, a four year old and one just a few months old, talks with a deep southern accent. \nWILSON No one in my family ever been to a hospital to give birth. My sister has four children and all were born at home. My mother and her mother, it just goes on and on. \nEXT. FRONT YARD - DAY \nA mother leaves with her baby wrapped in a blanket. The kids surround her, wanting to see the baby. \nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY \nPat is looking at a book of baby names. Harry passes the door and stops. \nHARRY A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days. \nPAT That's nice. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThere is one fish in the bucket. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LAKE - SUNSET \nWIDE ANGLE SHOT FROM HIGH ANGLE \nGideon and Sunny are sitting next to each other. The lake reflects the sky: a deep red. The eerie sound of a long train whistle breaks the silence. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nHarry, Babe Brother and Linda come in after staying out all night. Linda looks as though she is about to fall asleep standing up. She awakes and looks at Harry. There is dislike in her stare. Suzie and Gideon notice Linda fading away. \nSUZIE Are you feeling well? \nLINDA I've never been so tired in my life. Where is Sunny? \nSUZIE He is getting his things together. Babe Brother, you ought to take your wife home so she can get some rest. \nBABE BROTHER In a minute. \nSunny comes in carrying his night-clothes folded neatly. He stands next to Linda. Harry, in a mild but demanding way, ushers Babe Brother out of the door. \nHARRY Take your wife and child home, boy. \nBabe Brother seems all too happy to obey Harry. After Harry closes the door behind Babe Brother, he turns with a wide smile. \nHARRY (CONT'D) I got a surprise for you tonight. \nHarry flops down on the couch and kicks his shoes off. \nHARRY (CONT'D) This old buffalo has been in the sun too long. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nSuzie and Gideon are getting the food ready while Harry, wearing a shirt that looks like it is made of shiny snakeskin, sits in a darkened corner of the room, cutting his fingernails with his knife. \nThe door bell rings and Harry slowly walks over to answer the door. Suzie puts the punch bowl down and hurries over to meet the first guests, FRED JENKINS, an elderly black man whom she hasn't seen in years, and Esme Jenkins, his wife. \nSUZIE Fred Jenkins. \nJENKINS Suzie, you haven't changed and you, Gideon, if you don't look like John Henry. Oh, this is my wife, Esme. My first wife Lulie died. \nMore people arrive, bottle-necking the doorway. Gideon helps the Jenkinses to a chair. Hattie comes with her brother MARSH, who is not too pleased to see Harry. OKRA TATE, an elderly black man with dark circles under his eyes, comes in limping badly with an old Polaroid camera hanging from his neck. \nBabe Brother, Linda, Junior, Pat and Rhonda, who is holding Sunny's hand, all come in together. M.C. drags Herman through the door coughing. FLIM ANDERSON and his son DOUG are followed by the twins, WILLIAM and LOVIRAY NORWOOD, who are in their late 70's. \nBabe Brother leaves Linda standing by herself to be next to Harry. \nZenia Dent, an elderly white woman with a strong Southern accent, arrives with her husband, Howard Dent, a black man, who is in a wheelchair. The Twins and Howard are the center of attention. \nOkra comes over and whispers into Harry's ear. Okra leaves through the front door. Okra comes back in with a bag. Harry, Babe Brother, M.C. and Herman follow Okra to the kitchen. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nOkra sets the bag on the table and steps back to allow Harry to unveil the bottle of corn liquor. \nBABE BROTHER What is that? \nHARRY Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor. \nA crowd starts to gather around. \nOLDER MAN Get yourself a pace-maker like me. \nLinda is standing by herself. She watches Babe Brother and Harry walk towards the kitchen. Pat comes to talk to her. \nPAT These old folks can dance better than I can. Get rid of that long face. Get one of these old farts to show you how to do the Black Bottom. \nOkra, holding his camera, all of the attachments in one hand and a glass in his other hand, tries to offer Hattie a drink. \nOKRA Don't be so stand-offish. \nHattie pushes him away. The drink spills on him. She turns and walks away. He follows her. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMarsh sits in a chair opposite Harry. Babe Brother stands behind Harry. Harry, knowing that Marsh is going to bring up unpleasant things of the past, feels the need to get rid of Babe Brother. \nHARRY Son, you haven't danced with your wife all night. \nBabe Brother is reluctant to leave, but Harry gives him a nudge. He goes looking for Linda. \nMARSH There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die? \nHARRY Now who are we talking about? \nMARSH Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one... \nHARRY Wasn't Hocker lynched? \nMARSH You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree? \nHARRY What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush? \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT \nGideon, Babe Brother, and Linda go outside. \nEXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT \nThe sounds of the party drift out from the house as Gideon, Linda and Babe Brother talk. \nGIDEON Tell me, how come me and Suzie have to be mother and father to your child? You never take the boy to the park, circus or anything. If we did not take him to church, he wouldn't have any sense of religion. \nLINDA I think forcing him to go to church when he really doesn't understand is not saving his soul. When he gets old enough to make up his own mind about religion, that will be better. It will be his intellectual decision. \nGIDEON Is that the way your parents raised you? \nBABE BROTHER Why, you don't want us to bring him over? \nGIDEON No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature. \nBABE BROTHER Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that. \nGIDEON Junior spends time with his child. \nBABE BROTHER Oh here we go with that. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT \nOkra is trying to get enough light for his old Polaroid camera. M.C. takes a shade off a lamp and holds it next to the Twins, nearly blinding them. \nWILLIAM Hurry up and take this picture. \nFRED If it wasn't for the NRA, colored people would have been the lost tribe. \nFLIM Remember what they use to call the NRA? Negro Raggedy-ass Army. \nHARRY (CONT'D) What's the problem here? \nSUZIE She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil. \nThe twin is holding her throat and PANTING like a fish out of water. She is in a lot of pain. William, the twin brother, is standing at the door with a tragic face. \nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nGideon is trying to get out of bed. He sits on the side of the bed and starts to COUGH. \nINT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nHarry has his back to the camera, sitting in a chair facing a wall. He is naked from the waist up. An empty plate is placed not too far from where he is sitting. He is cutting an apple. He licks the blade of his knife. \nINT. BABE BROTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nBabe Brother is asleep. Linda is dressed to go to work. She throws his suit on the foot of the bed. \nLINDA Are you going to work or sleep all day? \nHe snores louder. She opens the window and pulls back the cover. The cold air makes him draw up. On walking out, Linda says in a rather hurt voice: \nLINDA Remember, you promised to take Sunny to Magic Mountain today. \nBabe Brother slowly gets up holding his chest as if his heart is bothering him. \nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nGideon tries to put his pants on. He is too weak and sits back on the bed with his pants only up as far as his knees. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nSuzie gets up to turn off the coffee kettle. When the kettle WHISTLE dies away, the sound of Gideon's VOICE is heard calling Suzie for help. The sound of his voice frightens her. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nSuzie bursts into the room and then moves very slowly to Gideon, who is sitting on the bed out of breath. \nGIDEON I'm worn out. \nSUZIE Just stay in bed and rest. \nGIDEON I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up. \nSUZIE You stay inside. I will see to them. \nGIDEON I will appreciate that. \nINT. DINING ROOM - EVENING \nSuzie and Junior are sitting at the dining room table. Harry, looking like he has just gotten out of bed, drags himself in. \nHARRY How is everybody? \nSUZIE Tolerable well. \nJUNIOR How did you sleep last night? \nThere is obvious hostility in Junior's tone. Harry senses Junior's hostility and chooses to ignore it. \nHARRY Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today? \nSUZIE He wasn't able to get out of bed today. \nHARRY I hope that it's nothing serious. \nHerman hands Harry the ax. Harry is poised over the chicken with the ax, appreciating the moment. Harry raises the ax. The SOUND of Rodney starting to practice his trumpet brings the rooster out of the trance. \nBefore Harry can react, the rooster jumps away. \nOKRA Herman, you will have to catch the next one 'cause I'm out of breath. \nHERMAN If I have to chase after one, we won't eat. \nA sack drops over the fence. Okra limps over to see what is in the bag. He uses a stick to open the bag. He doesn't like what he sees and throws the bag back over the fence. \nINT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL, WARD - DAY \nSuzie, Junior and Pat are standing around Gideon's bed. He is in a room full of old veterans who are apparently nearing the end. \nTwo old veterans, one white and the other black, sitting opposite each other wearing medals, sit in silence staring into each other's eyes. A nurse empties an old man's urine bag. The old man doesn't show any embarrassment about his predicament. Gideon looks at how the patients are treated. \nGIDEON I don't want to stay here. (beat) Where is Babe Brother? \nINT. HERMAN'S ONE ROOM HOUSE - DAY \nM.C. is sitting on the bed, reading the job section of the paper. Herman is putting Vicks Vapo-Rub in a bowl of boiling water. He covers his head over the bowl with a towel. Okra is sitting at the table examining his gun. He points it at the floor, seeing if the sight is straight. \nHarry is sitting at the table with Babe Brother. Harry is showing him how to cheat at cards. \nHARRY Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything? \nBABE BROTHER It is just a regular card. \nHARRY Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT \nA moth flies around the light casting a shadow that floats over everything. Suzie turns out the kitchen light and then turns out the dining-room light. She goes to her room and closes the door, leaving the room dark. A car headlight passing outside casts a moving pattern that moves along the wall. \nThe light reveals Harry's presence standing in the hall doorway. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nGideon is being helped up the steps by his sons. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY \nSuzie is holding the door open while Gideon is carried in by Junior and Babe Brother. Gideon is led to a chair. He still looks awful. \nBABE BROTHER Doesn't he look a whole of lot better? \nSUZIE Well, you look better than you did yesterday. \nGIDEON Next time, I don't care how sick I'll be, don't take me back to the Veteran's Hospital. \nHarry comes out of the bathroom, having just taken a bath. Harry seems delighted to see Gideon again. \nHARRY Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river. \nGIDEON I tell you, I feel like a ghost. \nHarry signals Babe Brother to come over to him. \nHARRY Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over. \nBABE BROTHER Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know. \nHarry flops down on the couch. Suzie sets a cup of coffee on the table for Gideon. Harry looks up from sharpening his knife on a hand sharpening stone. He spits on it. \nHARRY That smells like fresh coffee. \nRhonda and Sunny leave. Pat turns on Junior about talking bad about Babe Brother and Linda in front of Sunny. \nPAT You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together. \nJUNIOR Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit. \nLINDA Something just took control of him. He stays out all night and comes home with a pocket full of money. \nPAT It's probably Harry, but I hate to mention his name, because every time we say something about him something bad happens. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nRhonda and Sunny are looking under a strawberry plant. Sunny has strawberry stains around his mouth and on his shirt. Rhonda is putting her strawberries in the bowl. After getting a bowl full, they lay on the grass, eating strawberries while looking up at the clouds slowly drifting by. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nBabe Brother is driving along a country road while Harry, sitting in the front seat next to him, yawns. Harry is tired. \nHARRY Let us walk awhile. I grow weary when I sit still too long. \nBabe Brother's car stops in an orchard-like area. \nEXT. ORCHARD - DAY \nBabe Brother and Harry get out of the car. They walk on a path that takes them under low hanging tree limbs. It gets darker as they go deeper into the orchard. Babe Brother finds the going rough and loses his footing. \nHARRY Give me your arm lest you fall. \nHarry has to help him stay on his feet. Babe Brother finds it necessary to take Harry's arm. Babe Brother stops and Harry walks a few more steps ahead and waits for Babe Brother. Just ahead sitting on a branch is a huge white owl camouflaged by tree branches. \nBABE BROTHER I could swear I heard my son call me. \nHARRY You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there. \nBABE BROTHER I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong. \nBabe Brother turns and starts hurrying back before Harry can object. He walks slowly after Babe Brother who is doubling the distance between himself and Harry as he runs through the orchard to his car. Harry stops and looks around. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY \nPat, Linda and Junior are seated at the table. The suitcases are in the middle of the floor. \nLINDA I told Babe Brother that if Harry sets foot in our house again, I'm taking Sunny and leaving. Just as I said that, here come Harry and his old resurrected friends, hobbling up the steps. \nJUNIOR Is that how you got that black eye? \nPAT Don't ask that. \nLINDA No, this was an accident. \nJUNIOR Sure. \nLINDA It was unintentional. \nJUNIOR Babe Brother reminds me of the story of the man who wanted to be sizable. He wanted to be tall but what he was really short on was brains. There was a time when people had moon fever were treated with leeches. \nThe phone rings and Junior goes to pick it up. Linda's and Pat's attention is focused on the phone. Junior hands the phone to Linda. \nJUNIOR (CONT'D) It's that nut of yours. \nLinda hesitates but Pat takes the phone from Junior and puts it in her hand. \nLINDA What do you want? (beat) No. Nothing happened to him. \nSunny and Rhonda enter. Linda turns to look. Sunny's hands and face look bloody from eating strawberries. She puts the phone down and examines his dirty face. Pat brings Linda a wet towel. \nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSuzie is sitting in a chair; her head is bent forward. Gideon is TALKING in his sleep. She awakes and nods off again. Harry sticks his head in. \nHARRY How is he doing? \nSUZIE As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest. \nHARRY I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway. \nHarry helps Suzie to her feet. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nOkra is painfully standing on his bad feet. He is in his security-guard uniform, holding a bouquet of greens. As Suzie comes in, Okra tries to stand upright at attention. \nOKRA I brought you these greens and some salt meat. \nSUZIE That is very thoughtful of you. I haven't had time to tend to my garden like I should. \nSuzie takes the greens and puts them on the counter. She squeezes Okra's hand as a thank you. She pours him a cup of coffee. Okra eases down into the chair. He crosses his legs and starts massaging his feet. \nSuzie get herself a cup of coffee and sits opposite him. She stretches and tries to hold back a yawn. Okra looks at her in a slightly desirous way. \nOKRA You know Gideon and I are lodge brothers and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother. \nSUZIE You are very sweet, but Gideon has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him. He has a policy. \nOKRA If you become a widow, you will need someone around to fix the whatnots. We like for the widow to marry someone in the lodge. I know Gideon ain't gone yet, but there will be a lot of his old friends coming around to get in line. I just want you to consider this as a kind of a conditional proposal, to be first in line so to speak. \nSuzie keeps herself under control; she tries to find words to say. She stands up. \nSUZIE Excuse me. I have to go feed my dog. \nShe turns the fire out from under the coffee pot and exits the back door. \nOkra unties his shoes and begins to massage his feet. \nINT. BEDROOM / EXT. YARD - NIGHT \nHarry is sitting by the bed, just visible through the window. He seems restless. \nEXT. GIDEON'S BACKYARD - DAY \nThere is only one hen left in the coop. The garden is full of weeds. The sunflowers are bent by the force of the wind. A bag is thrown over the fence. \nThe shadows of pigeons flying overhead race along the ground. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nTwo shadows on the wall are facing each other. The shadows are the heads of two women, Suzie and Hattie. \nHATTIE You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog. \nSUZIE I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house. \nHATTIE Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children. \nINT. HARRY'S ROOM - DAY \nHarry has a plate of food in his hand. He stands facing himself in the mirror, staring at himself while he eats. He opens the door to leave but Sunny is in the hallway with his back turned sweeping. Harry stares at him and decides to go back in his room. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSUZIE He said he was busy. He is mad 'cause he wanted to get in the garage to get his things so he could go with Harry. \nLinda has a surprised look on her face. \nJUNIOR So he is busy? \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) \nBabe Brother is preoccupied sharpening his knife with a sharpening stone. He is almost in a trance. Junior comes in rather angrily. Sunny goes and sits in the shadows in the dining room. \nJUNIOR Why in the hell didn't you help mama? \nBABE BROTHER I told her I would if she would give me time. \nJUNIOR I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house. \nBABE BROTHER You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof. \nJUNIOR That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up. \nBABE BROTHER I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain. \nJUNIOR I ought to break your damn neck. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nSunny is sitting in a chair listening to his father and uncle argue in the kitchen. A car outside passes and the lights from the car form a crochet-like moving pattern on the wall behind him. Sunny is only lit for a moment. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) \nBabe Brother starts gathering up his things to leave. \nBABE BROTHER I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name? \nJUNIOR You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother. \nBABE BROTHER My name is Sam. Samuel. \nBabe Brother attempts to get up but Junior pushes him down. \nJUNIOR Sit down! \nBabe Brother hits Junior on the jaw, driving him backwards, causing the overhead lamp to sway violently. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nSuzie, Pat and Linda hear the noise coming from the kitchen and rush to see what is going on. \nINT. KITCHEN - RAINY NIGHT \nBabe Brother and Junior are both reaching for the knife. Junior is on top of Babe Brother, who is stretched out on the table trying to reach the knife. Junior grabs the knife first and Babe Brother flips over to defend himself. Babe Brother grabs Junior's wrist as Junior tries to push the knife against his throat. \nSuzie comes in and grabs part of the knife with her hand and Junior's wrist with her other hand. Pat and Linda try to pull the two men apart while pleading with Junior. \nBlood drips from Suzie's hand to the table, forming a pool under Babe Brother's head. \nPAT Stop it! Stop it! Look what you are doing! \nBabe Brother's eyes are rolled to the back. Junior's eyes are huge; he has an animal look on his face. The SOUND of struggling people breathing heavily is amplified. The pool of blood on the table grows larger. \nJunior slowly becomes aware of the blood and his body relaxes. He calmly releases the knife. \nJunior takes his mother's hand. \nJUNIOR Someone get some lard out of the ice box. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nMore injured people come but in spite of their condition they are told that they have to wait. There is only standing room. \nJunior and Babe Brother are standing next to the wall. \nOn the other side of the room, Suzie is looking quietly at them as if she is in deep thought. \nJunior walks over to the reception desk. \nJUNIOR Why is it so crowded? \nNURSE Well, it is Friday night and a full moon. \nJunior whispers to Babe Brother. They both start to laugh. \nSuzie looks up and finds them in a fit of laughter. A faint smile appears on her face. \nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nGideon is slowly getting up. He looks around. He calls for Suzie. He slowly gets to his feet. \nGIDEON Suzie, I'm hungry. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nHe walks by Linda, Pat, Rhonda, and Sunny, who are sleeping in chairs, on the floor and on the sofa. \nGIDEON Suzie. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) \nGideon opens the refrigerator and starts taking out bowls of food and placing them on the table. He puts on a pot of coffee. \nGIDEON Suzie. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) (LATER) \nGideon is busy eating almost everything in sight. A group of mystified and sleepy faces appear at the door. Pat, Linda, Rhonda and Sunny are all looking rather dumbfounded. \nEXT. BACKYARD - MORNING \nEverything is wet from the night's rain. The garden looks more like a graveyard. Moisture drips from the sunflowers. \nGideon's nervous looking rooster jumps the fence and starts to CROW. \nSkip is out early throwing rocks at his birds. The rocks land on Gideon's roof. \nEXT. HOUSE - MORNING \nBabe Brother and Junior help Suzie out of the car. She has her left hand bandaged. They are extremely exhausted. They walk up the porch to find Harry holding the door open. \nHARRY I can't believe what I heard took place. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY \nOn seeing Suzie, Sunny jumps up, knocking the can of marbles over the kitchen floor. He runs to give Suzie a hug. Sunny wants to touch her bandaged hand, but Linda stops him. \nSUZIE How is Gideon doing? \nRHONDA He is asleep now, but he was up all night eating. \nAs Suzie goes to Gideon's room, she comes face to face with Harry. She doesn't say anything. \nJUNIOR He slipped on some marbles that were on the floor. Then his heart gave out. \nLINDA (to Sunny) I told you to always put those marbles up and not to leave them just anywhere. \nPAT The poor thing is not to blame. Rhonda, take Sunny for a walk. \nMarsh hands Rhonda several dollars. \nMARSH Here, go around to the store and buy what you want. \nHATTIE Would anybody object if I take a look at him? \nHERMAN I don't think Harry would like it. \nHattie goes over and pulls the blanket back. Okra, M.C. and Herman hurry over to take a quick glance. They huddle behind Hattie, peeping over her shoulder. \nHATTIE I never noticed how big his eyes were. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. BATHROOM - EVENING \nLinda is helping Babe Brother wash Suzie's blood out of his hair. She dries his hair with a towel. Sonny hands Babe Brother a clean shirt, Gideon's shirt. He puts it on. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGideon is sitting on the edge of his bed looking through the scraps of leftovers on his plate. He puts his pants on. As he moves about, his joints SNAP and POP. He picks up the empty plate. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT \nBabe Brother is on the phone with the county morgue. He gets into an argument with the people on the other end of the phone. \nBABE BROTHER Mister... Mister... Excuse me for cutting you off but we pay taxes too. We should not have to pay you to take a 24-hour lunch break. \nBabe Brother hands the phone to Linda. \nBABE BROTHER (CONT'D) The coroner said that he was out here, and knocked on the door and no one was here. \nJunior steps over the body, holding a pot of coffee in his hand. \nThe Preacher is sitting with Suzie talking in a low voice. \nPat, Rhonda and Sunny come in with boxes of chicken snack. \nLinda hangs up the phone. \nLINDA He doesn't know when he will be out this way again. Somebody downtown is going to hear about this. \nM.C. They just do that in the colored neighborhood. If he had been white, they would had him on his feet and out of here. \nPAT I got white meat and I got dark meat. I know it sounds cruel but we have to eat. \nGideon comes in walking very slowly, holding his plate out. Everyone is shocked. Gideon is completely unaware of the period that he has been sick. \nGIDEON What, are you having another party? \nSUZIE You better come sit down. You are still sick. \nGIDEON Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick? \nJUNIOR You have been out for almost three weeks. \nThe Preacher gives him a pat on the back and shakes Gideon's hand. \nPREACHER We had long conversations with the Lord about you. Didn't we, Sister Suzie? I said we need him down here, Lord. \nShe rapidly dials the number. There is a BUSY SIGNAL. \nLINDA (CONT'D) This has been a nightmare. \nINT. BEDROOM - RIGHT \nM.C. and Marsh are going through Harry's boxes. They take out old blues records, books, a big Bible, and books on Dunbar. \nMARSH These are letters to his son. \nHattie reads the letters in a corner by herself. She stops reading for a moment. \nHATTIE I still don't know if I was right about Harry. \nShe seems frustrated with herself not being able to come to terms about who was Harry. \nEXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT \nA crowd of people are standing around looking at Gideon's house. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT \nThe Preacher is sleep in his chair, SNORING loudly. Babe Brother and Linda are sitting together, talking in almost a whisper. Sunny is asleep in his lap. Babe Brother is finding it difficult to apologize for his recent behavior. \nBABE BROTHER I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted. \nLINDA Like a veil has been lifted? \nBABE BROTHER It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters. \nLINDA Like muddy waters? \nBABE BROTHER It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like. \nLINDA You were in hell? \nBABE BROTHER I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body. \nLINDA Do you think you won? \nBABE BROTHER It was nip and tuck. \nLINDA And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel? \nBABE BROTHER I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there. \nLinda looks at Babe Brother for a length of time. \nGIDEON When are you boys going to fix that roof? \nBABE BROTHER Soon as I rest a bit. (beat) I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime. \nGIDEON Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHarry's body lies there motionless. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY \nThe Preacher is SNORING violently. \nBabe Brother is asleep on the floor. Sunny is asleep sitting on Linda's lap. Linda's feet rest on Babe Brother's chest. \nJunior and Pat are looking at the baby pictures. Pat is holding her hand across her stomach feeling the baby kick. Rhonda is asleep in a chair. \n", "test1_input": "LINDA What's a toby? \nHARRY You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child. (beat) In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since. \nLINDA I thought you weren't old fashioned. \nHARRY In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X. \nHarry is aware that Babe Brother is interested in the knife. After cleaning his last fingernail, he hands the knife to Babe Brother. \nHarry looks at the cards in his hand. He smiles to himself. \nHARRY Did you have your child at home? \nLINDA No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door. \nHARRY Some folks take that natural stuff too far. \nLINDA Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now. \nHARRY Country people got so many strange ways, \nHarry looks again at the chicken that he is boiling. \nBABE BROTHER Did you ever have to use this thing? \nHARRY That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out. \nLinda picks up a card and looks at it. There is a naked woman on the back. \nBABE BROTHER Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die? \nHARRY I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets. (beat) I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me. \nSunny is busy playing in the curtains. \nThe SOUND of Gideon and Suzie arriving makes them scurry to get the cards put away. Harry puts his knife away just as Suzie and Gideon enter. Linda feels a little embarrassed. \nLINDA How was church? \nGideon and Suzie are surprised to see Linda. They don't know what to say. \nEXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY \nRodney walks around in the yard BLOWING his trumpet as loud as he can. The SOUND of the trumpet frightens Skip's birds. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nGideon is repairing the pipes under the face bowl. Harry is leaning against the door. \nHARRY How often is your wife called to help delivery? \nGIDEON It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home. \nGideon takes the pipe off. It has rotted. Gideon cannot believe it. \nGIDEON (CONT'D) What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing. \nHARRY Everything these days is made overseas. \nGIDEON You and Babe Brother hit it off so well. \nHARRY Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy. \nGIDEON I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior. \n", "test1_true": "GIDEON You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story. \nHARRY You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son. \nGIDEON My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him. \nHARRY 'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead. \nOff-screen, Rodney starts to practice on his HORN. \nINT. BABE BROTHER'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nBabe Brother is sitting with Sunny by the screen door blowing giant bubbles. The bubbles drift past Linda, who is sitting at the table with real estate papers all over the table. She is talking on the phone with a client and signals them to stop disturbing her. \nBabe Brother sends more bubbles floating by, causing her to shake the water off her papers while she talks to a first time buyer. \nLINDA It has three bedrooms, one and a half baths. Well, yes, that means two toilets and one bath. Well... Yes, by appointment... Call me back if you decide. \nShe hangs up the phone. \nLINDA You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean. \nBABE BROTHER Will you still get the money from your father? \nLINDA I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property. \nBABE BROTHER Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it. \nLINDA We could borrow on that land and put the money to work. \nBABE BROTHER I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way... \nBabe Brother is lost in his thoughts. He stares down at his hands resting on his knees. He picks up the telephone. \nINT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY \nJunior is on the phone with Babe Brother. Pat crosses in front of the camera shaking her head in a negative manner. Babe Brother's voice is just audible. \nJUNIOR You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street. \nBABE BROTHER (O.S.) Why are you always afraid to get somewhere? \nJUNIOR This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal. \nBABE BROTHER (O.S.) This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street. \nJUNIOR Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him? \nBABE BROTHER (O.S.) Maybe I can get down there next week. \nJunior turns to his wife, who is off-camera. \nJUNIOR Babe Brother always acts like a gambler who is in the biggest game of his life and don't know about playing cards. \nEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON \nHarry and Gideon are walking along a railroad track. The sun is blinding. The heat makes the asphalt Appear to turn into a lake off in the distance. Gideon appears exhausted; beads of sweat continually form on his forehead. He fans himself with his hat. Harry is unaffected by the hot temperature. \nHARRY I can sit here and look at train tracks all day. We laid enough of them, didn't we? So many memories are stretched along tracks like these. \nGideon looks down the tracks. A bowl of dust stirs off in the distance. The hot temperature makes the tracks appear liquid. \nEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON (EFFECT) \nThe tracks begin to twist and bend. Off in the distance, faint images of men laying track to a song. \n", "test1_id": 1818, "test2_input": "BABE BROTHER Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right? \nLINDA Why in the h... \nClose to tears, she turns and with exaggerated care, puts the spoon down and gently puts Sunny in a chair. She starts to untie his shoes. Sunny stares at her while she keeps wiping her eyes. \nHARRY Let's give Dry Bones a call to see if he is coming or not. Okra likes to exaggerate, keep you waiting all night. \nHarry slowly gets to his feet and goes in the other room to use the phone. Linda watches him go. She is deep in thought. \nBabe Brother, attempting to cut the roast before it is ready, is pushed aside by Linda, who is almost out of control with rage. \nLINDA Why don't you wait? \nBabe Brother, attempting to forcibly cut a piece of roast, slings Linda's arm away. His hand accidentally hits her in the eye. \nLinda grabs the fork, poised to strike, but gains control of herself She looks like a person who is on the verge of having a breakdown. She goes back to putting the shoes on Sunny. \nBabe Brother, feeling sorry, doesn't know what to do. He automatically picks up the fork and washes it off. Linda picks up Sunny. \nINT. DINING ROOM - BABE BROTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nLinda is standing at the door, with a red eye, welcoming Harry's friends, which seem to be a long line of sickly people. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nLinda is busy serving everyone, running in and out of the kitchen bringing more things, and removing used plates, etc. Linda's eye is swollen and discolored. The guests look at Linda's eye and then cast a naughty-boy glance at Babe Brother. \nLinda stops serving to pay attention to an elderly man, who deliberately bends one of her spoons. She catches another man putting a fork in his pocket and an elderly lady putting a cigarette out in one of her plates. \nAs she is about to confront the man about pocketing her spoon, a peal of LAUGHTER forces her to turn around only to witness a lady knocking over a glass filled with a green drink with her elbow. The stain spreads across the table cloth in an even manner like a single wave. She watches it move from one end of the table to the other. \nHarry is seated in the middle. The composition hints at The Last Supper. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLinda is reading a book to Sunny, who has his coffee can of marbles emptied on the bed. The NOISE from the party in the next room is clearly heard. Every time she hears something CRASHING to the floor, she wrenches. Babe Brother comes in and stands in the doorway. Linda's eye is still swollen. \nBABE BROTHER You okay? \nLINDA I'm okay. Go back to your friends. \nBabe Brother closes the door and leaves Linda reading stories of Brer Rabbit to Sunny. She stops reading to look at him playing marbles on the bed. She smiles. \nEXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - DAY \nFive weighty Women, dressed in church robes, and the Preacher walk up Gideon's steps. \nSuzie invites the church members in. \nPREACHER Sister, we've come to see how you were doing. We came to ask if we could pray over Gideon. \nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY \nGideon is asleep. The church members gather around his bed. The Preacher puts his hand on the foot of the bed and discovers that there is something strange under the covers. Suzie looks at him and lifts the covers at the foot of the bed. Gideon's feet are resting on dead leaves. \nSUZIE I put some Plummer Christian Leaves under his feet to draw the fever out. \nPREACHER What else have you been giving him? \nSUZIE I crossed his stomach with cold oil and gave him some cow tea. \nPREACHER Suzie, I would think you would depend on prayer rather than these old fashion remedies. Let us read from the Bible. \n", "test2_true": "CLOSE UP GIDEON'S EAR. \nTHE SOUND OF A TRAIN WHISTLE IS HEARD. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PHOTO STUDIO, 1930 - DAY (DREAM EFX) \nA lady steps upon the stage which has different backdrops. She is the same lady in a photo that Gideon has hanging in one of the kid's rooms. The photographer, who is off-screen, asks about the background. \nPHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) What scene would you like in the background? \nLADY Something pleasant. \nPHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) We have plantations. \nThe woman shakes her head. \nPHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Natchez, cotton fields, Harlem, sunflowers, the Mississippi River. \nLADY Put the river behind me. \nA large picture of the Mississippi appears behind the lady. It changes from a painted backdrop to a moving picture. There is a storm developing off in the distance. The SOUND of thunder is heard. The picture in the background then changes to a boy on a mule. \nEXT. WET DIRT ROAD - DAY (RAINING) (DREAM EFX) \nThe boy on the gray mule doesn't have a shirt on. A light mist like rain covers him. Gideon walks along the picket fence towards the boy on the mule. \nAhead of Gideon seems to be a puddle but as he approaches, he discovers that it is an abyss. The boy and the mule on the other side fade away. Everything FADES TO BLACK. \nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThe Preacher turns a page in the Bible. Gideon has his mouth open like a fish trying to get air. The Choir continues to SING. The Preacher gets down on his knees and holds Gideon's hand; he bows his head. The Choir stops singing. The Bessie Smith recording of \"Muddy Water\" is coming from somewhere in the house. The Preacher looks around. Suzie is more puzzled. She goes to find where the music is coming from. \nINT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nSuzie knocks on the door. No one answers. She peeps in. No one is in the room. \nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM \nThe Preacher and the choir all have their hands on Gideon. Suzie enters the room. \nSUZIE I don't know where that music is coming from. \nINT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY \nJunior and Pat are helping Linda carry her baggage inside as Sunny reluctantly follows. It is obvious that Linda has left Babe Brother. \nSUNNY I want my daddy. \nJUNIOR Boy, hush that noise and get in this house. Make haste. \nSUNNY I want my daddy; I told you. \nJUNIOR Rhonda, drag him in here. If you be nice, I will take you to Disneyland. \nPat, Linda and Junior put the suitcases down. \nPAT Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to. \nJUNIOR I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth. \nLinda looks down, embarrassed. \nPAT Rhonda, take Sunny in the backyard. Take a bowl so you can pick some strawberries. Sunny will enjoy it. \n", "test2_id": 1819, "test3_input": "HARRY (CONT'D) I'll say my so-longs to Gideon before I leave and I truly wish that he will get well. \nSuzie continues to look at the picture. \nINT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nHattie is reading Harry's letters when he appears behind her. Hattie turns but is not surprised or concerned about Harry. She hands him back his letters, looks at him for a moment and goes. Harry looks down at the cracked dish. \nINT. HERMAN'S HOUSE - EVENING (RAIN) \nM.C. and Herman are packing. Okra is all dressed up with a pair of Stacy Adams shoes that make his feet look exaggeratedly long. Babe Brother and Harry are sitting at a table playing blackjack. Okra picks up one thing at a time, making the packing much harder. There is a stack of old dusty 78 record; Okra, trying to step over the records, kicks over a box of mothballs that roll across the floor. Okra has to step over boxes of toilet paper. \nOKRA Why did you buy so much toilet paper? \nM.C. I got that on the job when I was a janitor. They didn't pay me. \nHarry picks up an old cigar box that falls opens. Dice, shotgun shells, some spent .38 slugs and an old rusty knife, a crab apple switch, land on the floor. Harry picks up the knife. \nHARRY Whose old piece of knife is this? \nHERMAN That was my brother's knife. \nHarry gives the knife to Babe Brother and signals him to put it in his pocket. \nThe SOUND of the thunder has an unreal violence to it. \nHARRY I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time. \nBABE BROTHER This would be a bad time for me to leave. \nHARRY We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra? (then back to Babe Brother) Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up. (beat) What would you give to be rich? \nBabe Brother humps his shoulder. Babe Brother looks at his hand. \nBABE BROTHER Had Moms and Pops given me my share of what was mine, I could have been rich by now. Linda and I had it all worked out. \nHarry wins the first hand. \nHARRY I know your mind is on your wife but you should never treat a woman as an equal. You want to get your wife back, get another woman, one of those big hip women that will ride you till you sweat. \nHarry wins another hand. M.C. and Okra are still packing while Herman is eating Argo Starch. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Double the stakes? \nBabe Brother agrees but his thoughts are obviously somewhere else. Harry studies his hand and looks at Babe Brother; he puts down his hand. Babe Brother wins and is quite pleased. The next series of hands are won by Babe Brother. \nHARRY (CONT'D) M.C., you ever heard of a real man having one woman? \nM.C. No, lord! \nHARRY When one woman puts you out, you have another to take you in. You don't drive around without a spare tire, do you? The more mules you have hitched, the easier it is to plough. \nHarry loses another hand and Babe Brother suddenly has a pile of money. \nHARRY Herman, let me borrow a few bucks. \nHerman stand over him with a roll of bills and peels off several. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Bless you. Bless you. \nHerman is standing behind Babe Brother, SINGING to himself. \nHERMAN In the ground there is a hole and green grass growing around the hole. Now in the hole there is tree and green grass growing all around the tree. Now there is a hole in the ground, a tree in the hole and green grass growing around the hole. \nHARRY Let me share something with you. \n", "test3_true": "HARRY (CONT'D) Hattie is a snake. That woman broke up so many homes and caused a lot of misery and because she calls herself getting religion everything is put right. \nOkra is taking several shotguns out of the closet. \nOKRA These damn things are unloaded, ain't they? \nHARRY It's important to know the difference between the incoming fire and the outgoing fire. As Amos and Andy might say, \"We is the outgoing fire.\" Come with us, son. We'll show you some steaming hot juke joints, steaming hot women. \nM.C. A pot full of chitlins and a good time. \nBABE BROTHER Let me go by the house first. \nHARRY We will wait for you as long as we can. I got to get my things from your mother's house. \nBabe Brother hurries out. M.C., Herman and Okra flop down in chairs and on the bed and look at their watches. \nHarry sits at the table tapping out a rhythm on the table and WHISTLING very softly to himself. Suddenly Harry sees that Babe Brother left the pile of money on the table. A look of concern comes over his face. \nEXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN) \nIt is raining hard. Babe Brother gets out of the car. Running to get out of the rain, he slips and falls; he tries to get up but slips and falls again. He gets up and walks slowly up the steps as if he doesn't care whether he gets wet or not. \nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nSuzie helps him to take his wet coat off. She goes into the kitchen, puts his coat in front of the stove. The knife falls out. She picks it up and looks at it like she would throw it away but Babe Brother takes it. \nBABE BROTHER I need to get my suitcase out of the garage. \nSUZIE What for? \nBABE BROTHER I'm going back home with Harry. \nSUZIE I've heard some foolish things in my life. \nBABE BROTHER Harry is coming to pick me up. \nSUZIE Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling. \nBABE BROTHER I'm busy. \nSUZIE Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction. \nBABE BROTHER Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be. \nSUZIE I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough. (forcefully) You sit right there with your no manners self. \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN) \nJunior is carrying a roll of roofing paper. Pat, Rhonda, Linda and Sunny run to the porch to get out of the rain. Junior stacks the roofing paper in the corner of the porch and stamps the mud off his shoes. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nJunior, Pat, Linda and Rhonda come in to help Suzie move the bed from under the rain dripping through the hole in the ceiling. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) \nSunny stands in the doorway watching his father sharpen his knife that he got from Harry. Babe Brother is unaware that his son is watching him. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN) \nJUNIOR Where is Babe Brother? \nSUZIE Brother is in the kitchen. \nJUNIOR How come you didn't ask Babe Brother to help you? \n", "test3_id": 1820}

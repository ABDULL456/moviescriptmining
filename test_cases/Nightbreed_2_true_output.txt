DECKER: Yes. There's a remarkable consistency in the images you see. Great detail. Almost as though the violence was real. 
BOONE: They were just bad dreams. Midian doesn't exist. Monsters don't exist. 
DECKER: But murder does, Boone. Murder's very real. It may start in the mind, but it ends up changing to flesh and blood. 
He picks up the envelope we saw in his previous scene, and takes the photographs out. 
DECKER [cont.]: Two days ago the police brought me some photographs. They wanted to know if I had any patients who might be capable of what's in these photographs. I'm going to show you them. Are you ready for that? 
Boone nods. 
Decker lays the photographs on the table. Boone picks them up. We get glimpses of what they contain. Domestic horrors. Bloody scenes of corpses caught by the camera in grotesque positions, sliced up and bleeding. Boone's breath quickens. 
DECKER [cont.]: When you talk about murder on the tapes, I thought it was invention. Now I'm not so sure. 
Boone keeps staring at the pictures. The glassy eyes stare hard at him. His breathing is now rapid and shallow. One or two of the images seem to move. Bodies twitch. He drops the photographs. 
BOONE: I didn't... 
DECKER: Didn't what? 
BOONE: They were bad dreams. 
DECKER: What you describe in your sessions is very specific. Houses; faces... 
BOONE: I don't remember. 
DECKER: You want to hear? 
BOONE: No! 
Decker picks up the photographs. Boone, highly agitated, gets up and paces the room. 
BOONE[cont.]: You think I did this? 
DECKER: Six families killed over a two year period. All within driving distance of Calgary... 
BOONE [fury]: Do you think I did this? 
DECKER: I hope to God you didn't, for both our sakes. We've come a long way together. I don't want to believe this any more than you do. 
BOONE: But you do. 
DECKER: I wouldn't put us through this pain if I didn't...if I wasn't...afraid you had. 
BOONE [desperate; helpless]: What do I do? God, tell me what to do. 
DECKER: I can only go so far on your behalf. Patient confidentiality's one thing. Protecting a killer is another. 
BOONE [breaking down]: Jesus...Jesus...Jesus... 
Decker returns to his desk. Puts the photographs down and picks up a vial of prescription pills. He crosses to boone. 
DECKER: Listen to me. Take these, they'll help. Go home, and consider what we've talked about. I'm going to give you twenty-four hours to go to the police and answer their questions of your own accord. That's as long as I can give you. if you haven't complied by then, I'm afraid I'll have to tell them what I know. 
Boone grabs the pills. 
DECKER [cont.]: I can't tell you how sorry I am...

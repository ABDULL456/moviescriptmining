Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement. 
CHARLIE She was... insane. 
The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today. 
DR. BURTON Charlie, are you going to let me help you here? 
Charlie cries and nods. 
CHARLIE Okay. 
DR. BURTON Do you remember anything before you blacked out? 
CHARLIE I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home... 
We move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off. 
175   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                      175 
The sun creeps through the windows. We can hear birds outside. The intercom is quiet. Charlie is alone. He looks at Sam's typewriter. "Dear Friend" is already typed. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't go into detail about all of it. But I will say there were some very bad days. And some unexpected beautiful days. 
Charlie picks up a get well card from Sam. 
176   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                       176 
Dr. Burton walks Charlie's parents down the hallway. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) The worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me. 
In the distance, we see Charlie's mom and dad stop.    Shocked. 
177   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                       177 
Charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway. 
MOTHER Honey? 
His mother comes to hold him. 
MOTHER (CONT'D) I'm so sorry. 
For a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the sports page, before he chokes it down. He walks over to his son and kisses his forehead. 
178   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                   178 
Charlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) The best days were those when I could have visitors. My brother and sister always came for those until Chris had to go to training camp. He's going to be first string this year. And my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job. 
179   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                              179 
Charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand.    His mother waits in the hallway with Dr. Burton. 
DR. BURTON There he is. So, I'll see you Thursday at 6, right? 
Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there. I know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together. 
Dr. Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital. 
180   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT                             180 
The family sits at the dinner table. 
FATHER God bless this food that we are about to receive. We thank You for this bounty in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 
After they say "Amen," the room falls silent. The family is on pins and needles. No one touches their food. Until... 
CHARLIE How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad?

FADE IN: CLOSE -- KATE COLEMAN (MID 30S ) She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed, wearing a hospital gown. A heart rate monitor BEEPS. She touches her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Okayp, just relax.now. This'll be over Caitti before you know it. Kate looks up. Her smile falters-as we REVEAL: 
INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT 
Harsh lights overhead. -THUNDER rumbles outside. Kate's on a. delivery table, legs already in the stirrups. A sheet hangs- across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist. A DOCTOR and NURSE snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: SHARP BLADES and CURETTES, NEEDLES and FORCEPS. Kate is stricken. She tries to sit up. 
KATE Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't want to do this anymore. The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table. 
NURSE Your baby is dead. There's nothing. else we can do. Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp. Emotional free-fall. 
KATE No, this isn't what's supposed to happen. My baby's alive! 
NURSE We're so sorry. A terrible loss, we're so sorry... 
KATE But it's still alive! It's moving! Feel it, you can feel it! Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse- pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs, disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps. 
RATE No, stop! I want to be asleep! 
-DOCTOR- TOO late for anesthesia.'' The baby's coming. You're.going to experience some pressure now... - Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen work. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in surgical scrubs stands behind him.. Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing. He's Kate's husband, JOHN (late 30's). He smiles at her from behind -the camera. 
JOHN It's okay, honeys You're doing great! The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse. H e takes a SUCTION. CATHETER and disappears behind-the curtain again. The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the machine begins to HUM. Kate tightly closes her eyes. 
KATE This isn't happening. Wake up, wake up, wake up... Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric. W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING. 
NURSE Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman. It's a girl . The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle. Kate screams - 
INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
-- then snaps awake. She's been having a nightmare. John lies n ext to her in bed. Be stirs, but doesn't wake. Kate slips out of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom; 
INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Kate closes the door. We now see that she's not pregnant in reality, only in her nightmare. She slides to the cold floor in t he dark, a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry... 
INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE - DAY 
Water TRICKLES in a little Zen fountain. Kate sits across from -DR. -BROWNING, a mousy-haired woman in her 50's. 
DR. BROWNING A lot of women experience difficulties around the anniversary of the miscarriage or the baby's expected due date. It's perfectly normal. 
KATE I was thinking of" going back to work. I really thought 1 was doing better. 
DR. BROWNING You are. Think about where you were just four months ago. - (off Kate's look) Are you still sober? Kate hesitates. Dr. Browning gives her a penetrating look. 
KATE I drove by the wine shop,on my.way.bome the other day. 
DR. BROWNING Did you stop? 
KATE I really wanted to. The thought went through m' head, you know. it wasn't for me, it just might be nice to have a bottle handy in case we had guests. 
DR. BROWNING. But you didn't go in? 
KATE No. 
DR. BROWNING That's all that matters. Let's try to stay focused on the. positive. Grief is different for everyone. You have to take it at your own pace.. Keep writing in your journal. You're doing fine. Rate smiles weakly. unconvinced. 
INT. LIVING ROOM -.DAY 
Rate hangs curtains over a beautiful picture window. She steps' back to admire her work, then sighs. Now what? Now that she s done, the house suddenly seems-quiet and lonely and too big. 
INT. NURSERY - DAY

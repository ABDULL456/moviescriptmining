TURTLES (O.S.) Aw man! What's goin' on?! WHO 
TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS!? 
LEONARDO (O.S.) Ninja tag, topside! 
CUT TO: 
INT. DARK CHAMBER - NIGHT 
Another place that isn't the TMNT lair. Dark and mysterious. Don't know where we are. Feels ceremonial. We see close up detail of statue GRANITE. A DEEP VOICE chants OS in a South American tongue as HIGH- TECH GEAR is placed on the rock. It becomes powered, triggering a reaction in the stone itself. Music builds as we see quick shots of the granite cracks GLOWING RED. Camera travels with the rising glow. End on a pair of DEAD EYES - suddenly come to life. Red glow. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NYC ROOFTOPS - NIGHT 
The boys stand high atop the city below. Readying to run a gauntlet of rooftop hazards. They spy a BILLBOARD off in the distance.            M 
ICHAELANGELO First one to touch old faithful over there- 
DONATELLO -does the other team's chores for a week. Leo and Raph glare at each other. 
LEONARDO/RAPHAEL Deal. 
MICHAELANGELO I'm with Leo! 
DONATELLO Actually, I think you and I should pair up, Mikey. 
MICHAELANGELO You kiddin' me?! I mean, no offense Donnie, but you ain't exactly the biggest hitter on the bench. 
T 
Don is grinning. Observing the subtle tension. 
DONATELLO Just trust me on this one. Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on buildings. The course requires them to work as a TEAM, throwing, catching and propelling one another from obstacle to obstacle. Leo accidentally slips, PLOWING Raph face-first into a brick wall. Raph, convinced Leo did it on purpose, uses his next opportunity to hurl Leo dangerously high and far over a billboard. The situation escalates at each juncture. 
LEONARDO Have you been avoiding me? Barely seen you since I got home. 
RAPHAEL I been busy. 
LEONARDO 
(SARCASTIC) I see. So... you're definitely not upset at me or anything, right? 
RAPHAEL Why'd you think that? 
LEONARDO I don't know... your brother gets to go on a world-wide training mission and you have to stay home. Might upset me too. 
RAPHAEL Are you trying to make me mad? 
LEONARDO I'm just saying, I'd understand if you were upset. Their intensity ESCALATES. 
RAPHAEL You wouldn't understand the first thing about me, daddy's boy - OOF!. hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball. They stop rolling, continue fighting. 
LEONARDO Is that what this is about? You think Splinter likes me best? 
RAPHAEL You'd love that, wouldn't you?

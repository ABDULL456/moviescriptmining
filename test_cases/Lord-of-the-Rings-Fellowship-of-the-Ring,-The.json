An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the figure is reading a book.

The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight with EXCITEMENT!

SUDDENLY FRODO appears on a bank above the cart. \nFRODO You're late. \nCLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit... \nGANDALF A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. \nThey look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart. \nFRODO It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf! \nNext to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3 foot 6 inches tall. \nGANDALF You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOBBITON FIELDS -- DAY \nWide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by \nHOBBITS. \nFRODO What news of the outside world? Tell me everything! \nANGLE ON: \nGandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye. \nGANDALF What, everything? Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural... \nWide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy Hobbit Marketplace. \nGANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D) Well, what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much as if it has past age. Full of its own comings and goings, scarcely even aware of the existence of Hobbits... \nClose on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before him. \nGANDALF (CONT'D) ...for which I am very thankful. \nANGLE ON: \nHobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night. \nGANDALF (CONT'D) Ah, the long expected party. So, how is the old rascal? I hear it's going to be a Party of Special Magnificence. \nFRODO You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place in an uproar. \nGANDALF Oh, well...that should please him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFRODO Half the Shire's been invited... \nBilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam. He groans. \nBILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D) I was expecting you some time last week. Not that it matters, you come and go as you please, always have done, always will. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D) You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no, that might be a little risky... \nGandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf smiles to himself. \nBILBO (CONT'D) Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple tart...got some custard somewhere. Not much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh no...we're alright...I've just found some sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope it's enough. (comes into view) I could do you some eggs if you like? \nBilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf mysteriously appears behind him. \nGANDALF Just tea, thank you. \nBILBO Oh..right.     You don't mind if...? \nGANDALF No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud knock on the front door. \nMRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.) \nBilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there. \nBILBO I'm not home. \nGandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide. \nBILBO (CONT'D) I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again...mountains, Gandalf... and then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book...Oh, Tea! \nGANDALF So, you mean to go through with your plan, then? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILBO Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the arrangements are made. \nGANDALF Frodo suspects something. \nBILBO 'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not some block headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle! \nGANDALF You will tell him, won't you? \nBILBO Yes, yes. \nGANDALF He's very fond of you. \nBILBO I know. He'd probably come with me if I asked him. I think, in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods and the fields... little rivers. Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen window. \nBILBO (CONT'D) I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at Gandalf sadly... \nBILBO (CONT'D) I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. \nCLOSE ON: \nBilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping a small, unseen object. \nBILBO (CONT'D) I feel thin...sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday...a very long holiday and I don't expect I shall return...in fact, I mean not to. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BAG END -- EVENING \nGandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below them, final preparations are being made on the Party field. Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe. \nBILBO Old Toby, the finest weed in Southfarthing! \nBilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring. \nBILBO (CONT'D) Ohhhh, (smiles) Gandalf my old friend...this will be a night to remember! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT \nBOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories. Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit, Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away. \nFRODO Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance. \nSAM (horrified) I think I'll just have myself another ale. \nFRODO Oh, no you don't. Go on. \nSam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers. \nANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE \nas he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer. \nANGLE ON: \nBilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet. \nANGLE ON: FRODO \nstaring at the empty stool in disbelief. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BAG END -- NIGHT \nThe party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End. Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand. \nINT. BAG END -- NIGHT \nThe door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air, then places it in his pocket. \nANGLE ON: \nBilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He finds Gandalf looming over him. \nGANDALF I suppose you think that was terribly clever? \nBILBO Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their faces? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGANDALF There are many magic rings in the world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly. \nBILBO It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're probably right as usual. \nGANDALF You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you? \nBILBO I'm leaving everything to him. \nGANDALF What about this ring of yours?   Is that staying too? \nClose on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece. \nBILBO Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise. \nBILBO (CONT'D) No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it? \nGANDALF I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard? \nBILBO Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it. It's mine. I found it. It came to me! \nANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN. \nGANDALF There's no need to get angry. \nBILBO Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's mine. My own, my precious. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGANDALF Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you. \nBILBO So? What business is it of yours what I do with my own things? Bilbo's voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed. \nGANDALF I think you've had that ring quite long enough. \nBILBO You want it for yourself! \nGandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room \nGANDALF Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression softens. \nGANDALF (CONT'D) I am not trying to rob you. I am trying to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to Gandalf and hugs him. \nGANDALF (CONT'D) All you long years we've been friends...trust me as you once did. Let it go! \nBILBO You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go to Frodo. \nBilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door. \nBILBO (CONT'D) It's late, the road is long... yes, it is time. \nGANDALF Bilbo? \nBILBO Hmmm? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGANDALF The ring is still in your pocket. \nBilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket. \nThe jagged ruins of\" BARAD-DUR.

CITADEL, MINAS TIRITH -- NIGHT \nANGLE ON: GANDALF \nmaking is way down into the lower depths of the Citidel. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CITADEL CHAMBER, MINAS TIRITH -- NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: Pages flipping as Gandalf searches ancient scrolls and books placed high on a wooden table. His eyes settle on one old parchment. He murmurs hurriedly to himself, reading. \nGANDALF (reading) The year 3434 of the Second Age...here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor, and the finding of the ring of power. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE ON: ISILDUR, TRIUMPHANT, REACHES FOR THE ONE RING, HIS \nEYES FIXATED ON IT. \nGANDALF (reading) It has come to me...the ring of power! (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: GANDALF (CONT'D) It shall be an heirloom of my Kingdom...all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate, for I will risk no hurt to the \nGANDALF (CONT'D) ring...it is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain... \nCLOSE ON: ELVISH LETTERING MARKS ON THE FADED OLD DOCUMENT \nIN GANDALF'S HAND. \nGANDALF (reading) The marking upon the band begin to fade...the writing which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared...a secret now that only fire can tell... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOBBIT FARMHOUSE -- EVENING \nFARMER MAGGOT is chopping wood in his garden CLOSE ON: SNORTING HORSE NOSTRILS...as the shadow of a black rider looms over a Hobbit House.

A large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for Frodo. Frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his Assailant. Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight. Paranoia blazes in his eyes. His clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling. Hair and beard much longer an unkempt. \nGANDALF (urgent whisper) Is it secret? Is it safe? \nFRODO Remember what Bilbo used to say...it's a dangerous business... \nFrodo and Sam continue their journey. \nBILBO (V.O.) ... it's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door...you step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's not knowing where you might be swept off to. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is clearly visible \nEXT. ISENGARD VALLEY -- DAY \nGandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of ISENGARD...a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains. \nSARUMAN (V.O.) Smoke rises once more from the mountain of doom...the shadow takes shape in the darkness of Mordor; the hour grows late...and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel... \nThe strange tower of Orthanc...hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian...rises up in the center of the Isengard Circle. Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs. \nANGLE ON: SARUMAN, THE WHITE WIZARD \nhe sweeps down the Orthanc stairs. \nSARUMAN For that is why you have come, is it not, my old friend? \nGandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his long ride. \nGANDALF Saruman! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ISENGARD GARDENS -- DAY \nGandalf and Saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of Isengard, Saruman's clean, white robe contrasts with Gandalf's dusty grey robes. \nSARUMAN Are you sure of this? \nGANDALF Beyond any doubt. \nSARUMAN So the ring of power has been found? \nGANDALF All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose. \nSARUMAN And yet you did not have the wit to see it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind. \nGANDALF We still have time...time enough to counter Sauron...if we act quickly. \nSARUMAN Time?   What time do you think we have? \nCUT TO: \nINT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER -- DAY \nSaruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSARUMAN Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form...but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. \nGANDALF (softly) The eye of Sauron. \nSARUMAN He is gathering all evil to him. \nSARUMAN (CONT'D) Very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle earth. \nGANDALF You know this? How? \nSARUMAN I have seen it. \nGandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth... \nGANDALF A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman. \nSaruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir. \nSARUMAN Why?   Why should we fear to use it? \nGANDALF They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones...we do not know who else may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth back over the Palantir. \nFLASH IMAGE: A FIERY EYE! \nSaruman sits upon his throne. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSARUMAN The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving...the Nine have left Minas Morgul. \nPIPPIN That was close. \nFrodo picks himself up and looks around quickly. \nMERRY (groaning) Ow...I think I've broken something. \nPulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket. \nMERRY (CONT'D) Oh. \nSAM (turning on Merry and Pippin) Trust a Brandybuck and a Took. \nMERRY What? That was just a detour...a shortcut. \nSAM A shortcut to what? \nPippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road. \nPIPPIN (excited) Mushrooms! \nCLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind... \nSUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES... \nFRODO I think we should get off the road. \nA long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. \nFRODO (CONT'D) (more urgency) Get off the road! \nSam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent; his head turning from side to side. \nCLOSE ON: FRODO \nBeads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. \nCLOSE ON: FRODO \nHe is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to side like a bird of party. \nCLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT... \nQUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!   AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A \nBURST OF FLAME. \nANGLE ON:   SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN \nSAM Frodo? \nMerry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMERRY What was that? \nFrodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand. \nEXT. FERRY LANE -- NIGHT \nFrodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. \nSAM Anything? \nFRODO Nothing. \nPIPPIN What is going on? \nMerry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously. \nMERRY The Black rider was looking for something...or someone...Frodo? \nSAM Get down! \nThe SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline. The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs. \nFRODO I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I must get to Bree. \nMerry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep trouble. \nMERRY Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me ! \nThe Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of the forest TOWARD THEM! \nMERRY (CONT'D) There's another one!! Frodo, this way! ! \nThe Hobbits run   THE RINGWRAITH SHRIEKS! \nQUICK CUTS: \nBUTTERBUR Underhill?     Hmmmm. \nFRODO We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR frowns... \nBUTTERBUR (Puzzled) Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh... (recognition) Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with relief...Butterbur shakes his head. \nBUTTERBUR (CONT'D) Not seen him for six months. Frodo is shocked. \nSAM (worried whisper) What do we do now? \nINT. PRANCING PONY INN -- NIGHT \nWide on: the noise, smokey Inn. It is dimly lit, cheifly from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall... clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous... Sam can't help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFRODO Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come. \nMerry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large mug of beer. \nPIPPIN What's that? \nMERRY This, my friend, is a pint. \nPIPPIN It comes in pints?    I'm getting one! \nSam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar. \nSAM You've had a whole half already. Merry watches Pippin go. \nA COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at Frodo, then quickly look away. \nSAM (CONT'D) (tense) That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we've arrived. \nSam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur... \nFRODO Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is he? \nBUTTERBUR He's one of them Rangers; they're dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I never heard, but round here he's known as Strider. \nFRODO (to himself) Strider. \nBENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE RING. \nCLOSE ON: FRODO \nSweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills into the Soundtrack. \n\"Baggins...Baggins...\" a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice: \nPIPPIN Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's over there... \nANGLE ON: PIPPIN \nsitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar. \nPIPPIN (loudly) Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin once removed, on his mother's side and my third cousin twice removed on his father's side...if you follow me. \nFrodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer. \nFRODO Pippin! \nPIPPIN Steady on, Frodo! \nPippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all the attention turns to Frodo... \nCLOSE ON: \nThe ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp intake of breath...followed by total silence. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BREE COUNTRYSIDE -- NIGHT \nThe RINGWRAITHS turn sharply in their saddles...Instantly aware that the ring is being worn. They spur their horses towards the distant lights of Bree. \nINT. \"PRANCING PONY\" INN -- NIGHT \nSam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly; the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into excited babble. \nIN THE TWILIGHT WORLD: \nANGLE ON: \nFRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring: THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE EYE, wreathed in flames. \nVOICE OF SAURON \nThere is no life here in the void...only cold...only death... FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately pulling the ring from his finger. FRODO MATERIALIZES into the real world. AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY! \nSAM (CONT'D) (horrified) Frodo! \nAnother Ringwraith is burning and screaming...others screech fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the Weathertop summit. \nSAM (CONT'D) (panicked) Mr. Frodo!! \nStrider kneels before Frodo. He snatches up the Witch King's Dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin, blade. \nSAM (CONT'D) Help him, Strider! \nSTRIDER (grim) He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. The Morgul Blade suddenly melts...vanishing into the air like smoke. Strider throws the hilt down in disgust... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSAM Do something. \nSTRIDER This is beyond my skill to heal. (urgently) He needs Elvish medicine. Strider lifts Frodo onto his shoulders. \nEXT. WEATHERHILLS -- NIGHT \nStrider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing Frodo on his back. Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running to keep up. The hobbits are carrying Flaming torches for protection. \nSTRIDER Hurry! \nSAM We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo groans. \nSTRIDER Hold on, Frodo. \nSAM He'll never make it! Close on: Frodo...head lolling about, barely conscious. \nFRODO (fevered calling) Gandalf...Gandalf? \nEXT. ISENGARD -- NIGHT \nLow angle...looking up at ORTHANC...the tower of Isengard, gleaming in the moonlight. The camera rises to reveal the once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland...with smoke and fire billowing out \nof numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt of ORTHANC. Strange guttural chants echo up from deep underground. The camera is rising...a small moth flutters into shot...and leads the camera towards the summit or Orthanc. Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at lighting speed and SNATCHES THE MOTH. Gandalf brings his hand close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue. Close on: THE MOTH'S face... seemingly listening. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIt suddenly flutters away. CAMERA FOLLOWS the moth off the Orthanc summit, but drops past the moth...falling down, down, towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red tunnel! \nINT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- NIGHT \nThe dead trees of Isengard are fed into roaring furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal, beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are forged from the great furnaces. Saruman strides among the ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes its birthing membrane...this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand before his master. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TROLLSHAW FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT \nClose on: Frodo...his eyes flicker open...clouded, red- rimmed...his brow, beaded with sweat. \nPIPPIN Is he going to die? Frodo's breathing is getting shallow. Strider looks out into the darkness. \nSTRIDER No. He is passing into the shadow world, he will soon become a wraith like them. \nA DISTANT CRY of a RINGWRAITH carries through the air. \nMERRY (nervous) They're close. \nFrodo gasps in sudden pain. \nSTRIDER (thinking hard) Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Sam looks blank. \nSAM Athelas? \nSTRIDER Kingsfoil. \nSAM Kingsfoil.     Aye.    It's a weed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSTRIDER It may help to slow the poison. Hurry! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TROLLSHAW FOREST -- NIGHT \nSam and Strider desperately search the dark forest floor for the Athelas plant. Close on: A small, white flowered plant! Strider drops to one knee, carefully pulling it from the ground. \nSUDDENLY!    STRIDER FREEZES AS A SWORD BLADE TOUCHES HIS NECK. \nARWEN (O.S.) What is this? A Ranger caught off his guard? \nStrider slowly looks up. \nARWEN Noro lim, Asfaloth! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FORD OF BRUINEN -- DAY \nCRANE DOWN: As the White Horse races towards Camera, to Reveal the wide river Bruinen in the foreground. \nWithout hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford. \nWITCH KING Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws her sword and yells at the Witch King. \nARWEN (yelling) If you want him, come and claim him. \nTHE WITCH KING SCREECHES ANGRILY, draws his sword, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford. The water starts flowing faster...a distant rumble can be heard. Arwen waits until they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle arms raised! \nARWEN (CONT'D) (Elvish) Non o Chithaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin Briunen Dan in Ulaer! (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ARWEN (CONT'D) Nin o Chitaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin Bruinen Dan in Ulaer! \nTHE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR! \nFrodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries them away! CLOSE ON: FRODO as he loses consciousness... \nARWEN (upset) No, no...Frodo, no!     Frodo, don't give in...not now! \nArwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away. \nINT. FRODO'S DELIRIUM -- DAY \nDELIRIOUS IMAGES AND SOUNDS.... \nARWEN (V.O.) What grace is given me, let it pass to him. Let him be spared. Save him. \nIMAGE: A BRIGHT LIGHT suddenly flares...Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping. \nFRODO (frightened) Where am I? \nA FAMILIAR VOICE cuts through the swirl of sound. \nGANDALF (O.S.) You are in the House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning on October the twenty-fourth, if you want to know. \nINT. FRODO'S BEDROOM -- DAY \nFrodo's eyes flicker Open He is lying in bed next to an Open Window...Dappled sunlight plays on richly carved timbers...the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the Vista of Fir Trees. \nFRODO (weak relief) Gandalf! \nANGLE ON: GANDALF IS SITTING NEXT TO FRODO'S BED... \nsoftly puffing on his pipe.    He smiles at Frodo. \nGANDALF Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be here, too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. You have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit. \nFrodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly... \nFRODO What happened, Gandalf?    Why didn't you meet us? \nGANDALF I'm sorry Frodo. \nClose on: Gandalf... troubled.   His eyes drift away. \nGANDALF (CONT'D) I was delayed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ORTHANC SUMMIT -- NIGHT \nSARUMAN stands over Gandalf, gloating... \nSARUMAN Get up! So much for the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction! \nWith the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor. \nGANDALF There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will...and he does not share power. \nSUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off the Tower! Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE. \nSARUMAN (chilling) So you have chosen death! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAINS--DAWN \nGwaihir the Eagle soars majestically over the mountains, carrying Gandalf towards the dawn. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRODO'S BEDROOM--RIVENDELL \nFrodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf. \nFRODO More than anything. \nSAM I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell...and I thought... seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home. \nFRODO You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam... \nFRODO (CONT'D) ...we did what we set out to do. Frodo opens his hand, the Ring sits in his Palm. \nFRODO (CONT'D) The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ELROND'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY \nGandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony, \nELROND His strength returns. \nGANDALF That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life. \nELROND And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil. \nGANDALF It is a burden he should never have to had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo. \nELROND Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the east. His eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGANDALF His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring. \nElrond turns and walks away... \nELROND This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves...We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay here. \nGandalf turns and looks out the window. \nSounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli. \nELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D) This peril belongs to all Middle earth. They must decide how to end it. Not just for themselves but for those who come after. Elrond approaches Gandalf. \nELROND (CONT'D) The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we have gone? The dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others. \nGANDALF It is in Men that we must place our hope. \nELROND Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten. It is because of men    the Ring survives. \nFLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts. \nELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D) I was there, Gandalf...I was there three thousand years ago when Isildur took the ring. \nFLASH INSERT: ISILDUR PICKS UP THE RING AND STARES AT IT, \nENTRANCED. \nELROND I was there the day the strength of Men failed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRACK OF DOOM -- DAY \nELROND Isildur...hurry...follow me! IMAGES: ELROND leads Isildur into the steaming volcano. \nELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D) I let Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom, where the ring was forged: the one place it could be destroyed. \nFLASH INSERT: ELROND AND ISILDUR STAND BEFORE THE FIRES OF \nMT. DOOM. \nELROND Cast it into the fire...destroy it! \nCLOSE ON: ISILDUR...CAPTIVATED BY THE RING. \nISILDUR No. \nIsildur turns and walks away \nELROND Isildur!! \nINT. ENROND'S CHAMBER, RIVERDELL -- DAY \nElrond turns to Gandalf. \nELROND It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the Ring...and the line of Kings was broken. There's no strength left in the world of Men. They're scattered, divided, leaderless. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGANDALF There is one who could unite them, one who could re claim the thrown of Gondor. \nBOROMIR It is a gift...a gift to the foes of Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, held the forces of Mordor at bay...by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy...let us use it against him! \nSTRIDER You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it has no other master. Boromir turns and looks at Strider, coolly. \nBOROMIR And what would a ranger know of this matter? \nStrider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively. LEGOLAS stands... \nLEGOLAS This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance. \nFrodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply. \nBOROMIR (quiet disbelief) Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir? \nLEGOLAS And heir to the throne of Gondor. \nARAGORN (Elvish: with subtitles) Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas.. \nBOROMIR Gondor needs no king. \nGANDALF Aragorn is right...we cannot use it. \nELROND You have only one choice..the ring must be destroyed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nThe HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears. Gimli suddenly stands, excited. \nGIMLI Then...what are we waiting for? \nGimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him with concern. \nELROND The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we \nELROND (CONT'D) here possess. The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom...only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. One of you must do this. \nStunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice \nBOROMIR One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly. \nLEGOLAS Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed. \nGIMLI And I suppose you think you're the one to do it? \nBOROMIR And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his? \nGimli leaps to his feet! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nGIMLI I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT erupts around the room. CLOSE ON: FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in slow \nmotion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows louder in his head. \nGIMLI (CONT'D) (shouting) Never trust an Elf! \nCLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band. \nGANDALF Do you not understand? While we    bicker among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows! No one will escape it. You will   all be destroyed, your homes burnt and   your families put to the sword! \nCLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in a strong, clear voice. \nFRODO I will take it...I will take it...I will take the Ring to Mordor. \nSudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces. \nFRODO (CONT'D) (quietly) Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf rises to his feet. \nGANDALF I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear. \nARAGORN If, by my life or death, I can protect you, I will. (kneels before Frodo) ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nLEGOLAS And you have my bow. \nGIMLI And my axe. \nBoromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo. \nBOROMIR You carry the fate of us all, little one. \nBoromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf. \nBOROMIR (CONT'D) If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done. \nMERRY Quite good, Pippin. \nPIPPIN Thanks. \nCLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf.... \nGIMLI If anyone were to ask for my opinion, which I note they have not, I would say we are taking the long way round. Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks that is a bad idea. \nGANDALF No, Gimli. I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice. \nBoromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying smoke in the wind. \nSAM What is that? \nGIMLI Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud. \nBOROMIR (worried) It's moving fast...against the wind. \nLEGOLAS Crebain from Dunland! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nARAGORN (urgently) Hide! \nBOROMIR Merry..Pippin...Sam...take cover! WIDE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little cover \nthere is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the south. Gandalf staggers to his feet. \nGANDALF (worried) Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is being watched. \nGandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing towards a high mountain pass. \nGANDALF (CONT'D) We must take the pass of Caradhras! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE -- DAY \nANGLE ON: \nThe Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands, the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as if transfixed. \nARAGORN Boromir? \nBOROMIR It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing...such a little thing. \nARAGORN (quietly) Boromir...give the ring to Frodo. ARAGORN'S HAND moves to his sword hilt. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRing's POV...looking up at Boromir's face. The strange hum vibrates on the soundtrack. CLOSE ON: a Weird beatific smile lights up Boromir's face...The HUM grows to a Deafening roar! Boromir suddenly snaps out of his trance and hands the ring back to Frodo. \nBOROMIR (lightly) As you wish. I care not. \nBoromir smiles at Frodo, ruffling his hair. CLOSE ON: ARAGON unhands his sword. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ISENGARD -- DAY \nFollowing the crows as they race deeper and deeper, passing a vista of Industry, Hundreds of Orcs and writhing Birthsacks...flying past Saruman, who stands upon a wooden Gantry. CLOSE ON: Saruman, listening to the Cries of the crows. \nSARUMAN So, Gandalf...you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails...where then will you go? THE FELLOWSHIP struggles through the snow. \nSARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) If the mountain defeats you, will you risk a more dangerous road? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS -- DAY \nTHE FELLOWSHIP are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up towards the PASS OF CARADHRAS. Legolas the Elf moves lightly across the top of the snow...he suddenly pauses. Saruman's voice sweeps by in the wind. \nLEGOLAS (urgent) There is a fell voice in the air. \nGANDALF It's Saruman. \nTHUNDER RUMBLES...ROCK and Shale fall from above. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nARAGORN (urgently) He's trying to bring down the mountain. Gandalf! We must turn back! \nGANDALF No! \nGANDALF RAISES HIS STAFF...HE CHANTS INTO THE WIND. \nFRODO (quietly) It's a riddle... \nGandalf raises his eyebrows... \nFRODO (CONT'D) (explaining) Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the Elvish for friend? \nGANDALF Oh...mellon. \nWith that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness, something in the water stirs.... \nINT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT \nThe Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain. \nGIMLI So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves; roaring fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone. This, my friend, is the home of my cousin, Balin...and they call this a Mine... (snorting) A mine! \nA Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber... The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf    Skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOROMIR (grimly) This is no mine...it's a tomb! \nGIMLI (in horror) Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a crude arrow out of a skeleton. \nLEGOLAS Goblins! \nThe Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the Entrance. \nBOROMIR We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should never have come here. \nEXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT \nFrodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20 more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature. Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into Boromir's arms. \nGANDALF Into the mines! \nBOROMIR Legolas! \nLegolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many Coiling arms seize the large doors. \nINT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT \nWith a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face. Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the Fellowship into Pitch Blackness. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy Glow across the old wizards face. \nGANDALF (ominous) We now have but one choice...we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard...there are older and fouler things than the Orcs in the deep places of the world. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEW CHAMBER, MORIA -- NIGHT \nWIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above deep mine workings. \nGANDALF Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed. \nINT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT \nThey continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK -- NIGHT \nThe path splits into three passages...each disappearing into dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning. \nGANDALF I have no memory of this place. \nLATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. He appears to be in some kind of trance. \nCLOSE ON: FRODO \nHe turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind them. \nPIPPIN Are we lost? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMERRY No. I don't think we are.   Shhhh, Gandalf's thinking. \nPIPPIN Merry! \nMERRY What? \nThey fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries... Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt... \nSAM (worried) Mr. Frodo! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFrodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing blade! \nLEGOLAS Orcs ! \nARAGORN (to the hobbits) Get back! Stay close to Gandalf. \nAragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in his eyes. \nBOROMIR They have a cave troll! \nGimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb. \nGIMLI (yelling) Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath! \nBOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in 2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits! Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles backwards...the huge club descends for the killing blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back, spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it too, drops. \nSAM I think I'm getting the hang of this. \nThe Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest with his spear. \nFRODO Aragorn!   Aragorn! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall. \nARAGORN (shocked yell) Frodo!! \nThe hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee, bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge breath. \nSAM He's alive! \nFRODO I'm alright. I'm not hurt. \nARAGORN You should be dead. That spear would've skewered a wild boar! \nGANDALF I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye. \nFrodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll Spear did not pierce the mithril.\" \nGIMLI Mithril! You are full of surprises, Master Baggins. \nBOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again! Gandalf turns to the others. \nGANDALF To the bridge of Khazad-dum! \nCUT TO: \nINT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY \nGandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf Chamber. \nGANDALF This way! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThey hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches! Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the darkness. \nBOROMIR What is this new devilry? \nA HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles... \nGANDALF (quietly) A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world! This foe is beyond any of you! (urgent yell) Run! Quickly! \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY \nThe BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned. \nGANDALF Lead them on, Aragorn.

It glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's eyes are drawn to it. \nFRODO (CONT'D) Would you destroy it? \nARAGORN (kneeling to Frodo) I would have gone with you to the end... into the very fires of Mordor. \nFRODO I know...Look after the others, especially Sam...he will not understand. \nAragorn freezes!   He draws his sword. \nARAGORN (urgent) Go, Frodo! \nFrodo hesitates. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n"}

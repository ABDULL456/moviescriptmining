Frodo frowns. \nGANDALF (CONT'D) Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment...even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over.

All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There is a note of finality in Gandalf's voice. \nGANDALF (CONT'D) There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

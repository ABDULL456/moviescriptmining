Amber can't believe what she's hearing. 
AMBER Well, ah...Alabama.  A-L-A-B-A-M-A. Alaska.  A-L-A-S-K-A.  Arizona.  A-R-I- Z-O-N-A. 
V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE 
AMBER West Virginia.  W-E-S-T-V-I-R-G-N-I-A. Wisconsin.  W-I-S-C-O-N-S-O-N. Wyoming.  W-Y-O-M-I-N-G. 
Pan over to Judges.  They can't believe it.  Hank CLAPS retardedly.  He loves her. 
HAROLD (looking at others) Uh-okay, then. 
INT. DAKOTA COUNTY EATING DISORDERS CLINIC - MARY'S ROOM 
A NURSE now stands beside Mary. 
MARY With two weeks until the pageant... (continued labored breaths) I was practicing my talent.  Finishing my costume, brushing up on current events, and running eighteen miles a day on about four hundred calories.  I was ready. 
The nurse gives her a hit of oxygen.  Mary smiles and gives a THUMBS UP from behind the oxygen mask. 
DRESSING ROOM - HALLWAY 
PAN DOWN long, narrow room.  A counter, with mirrors and bare bulbs, cover one wall.  Girls set up their areas and change into their talent costumes. 
SUPER: DRESS REHEARSAL - DAY BEFORE THE PAGEANT 
IRIS Coupla things...Gladys wants to be sure we go in show order today.  All right?  So very important.  Don't forget that.

DRESSING ROOM - HALLWAY 
CLOSE ON LESLIE MILLER, in cheerleading uniform, standing beside small framed photos of her boyfriend on the counter. 
LESLIE (unusually serious) Oh-yah, really nervous.  It's been about two months.  I haven't told my boyfriend yet.  How did you know? 
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.) I meant, nervous about the pageant? 
LESLIE (suddenly perky) Oh!  Nervous about the pageant!  Yah sure! 
She kisses a photo and GIGGLES.

DRESSING ROOM - HALLWAY 
CLOSE ON BECKY holding a sequin-covered poodle skirt and sweater. 
BECKY There are eight thousand sequins and fifteen hundred beads on the skirt, alone.  My mom and Mrs. Lopez make it. She's one of my father's many Mexican (Me'hee'kan) workers he lifts from the poverty they know in Mexico (Me'heek'koe). 
CUT TO: 
DRESSING ROOM - HALLWAY 
CLOSE ON AMBER ATKINS at the far end of the counter. 
AMBER Yah-my ma's clothes all melted onto mine forming like this big polyester meteor in our closet, y'know?  But, in some kinda weird miracle, our neighbor boy, Kenny Johanson, found my tap costume on the roof-a their trailer while he was settin' coon traps for his dad.  Here's the weird part.  It was still on the hanger. 
DRESSING ROOM - HALLWAY 
CLOSE ON TESS WEINHAUS wearing "I love German Shepherds" sweatshirt, standing beside various trinkets. 
TESS And, uh, this is my lucky bolt.  They think it fell from a DC-10.  The doctor said I was lucky the flat side hit me, um, otherwise it coulda gone right through my head. (holds up red tap dress) I know, I know, gives me the willies, too.  I guess the explosion... 
Janelle Betz, wearing a flowing, nymph-like dress with ballet slippers, glides up to Amber. 
JANELLE (slow, due to signing) Amber?  Can we switch numbers?  I need to go first. (smiling to camera) My cousin just had a deaf baby and I get to go see it! 
AMBER Yah-sure, eight's my luck number anyway.  Diane Sawyer was number eight at her local.

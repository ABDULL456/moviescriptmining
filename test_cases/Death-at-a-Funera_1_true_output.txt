Jeff frantically searches the bushes where Oscar pushed him, looking for the pill bottle. He finds nothing. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Uncle Russell is creating havoc at the buffet table. He's pushing people aside and poking them with his cane. 
REVEREND DAVIS Are you alright? 
UNCLE RUSSELL No, my nephew is dead and these bastards ate all the potato salad. Nearby mourners look appalled. The reverend looks over and sees Aaron and Ryan coming down the kitchen corridor. She approaches them. 
INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR - DAY 
Reverend Davis appears in front of Aaron and Ryan. 
REVEREND DAVIS Ah! I think we're just about ready to start the service, so- 
AARON Would you mind giving us five minutes? 
REVEREND DAVIS 
(NOT HAPPY) Of course. 
AARON Thanks. Aaron walks off followed by Ryan. He passes Michelle, who's sitting on the couch. She stands up. 
MICHELLE Is everything okay? 
AARON No. I'm really sorry, honey, but buying a condo is going to have to be put on hold, just for now.

MICHELLE What are you talking about? Why?

MICHELLE What's the reason? 
AARON I haven't got time right now, please. I'll explain later. 
MICHELLE

RYAN 
(TO FRANK) You? So you and my--. You?! It's you. So when I called my father and he didn't answer, he was with you?! Aaron realizes what Frank is reading. 
AARON Hey, hey, hey! Aaron rushes over and takes the manuscript away from Frank. 
AARON (CONT'D) What are you doing with my manuscript?! It's not ready. He puts it in the desk.

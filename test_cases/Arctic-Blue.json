{"test1_input": "68   EXT.  PUMPING STATION \nChewing an unlit cheroot, Viking Bob pulls up next to Mitchell and LeMalle in the trappers' jeep.  They pile in. \n69   EXT.  HAUL ROAD \nEric backtracks as fast as possible in the crippled vehicle. \n70   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - (MOVING SHOT) \nAs the Scout heads for the Feldspar Creek bridge, it disappears from sight over a hill. \n71   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK \nViking Bob zooms over Feldspar Creek.  They come over the rise, but the Scout still can't be seen ahead of them. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nThe Scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed, below the Haul Road.  Above, the trappers speed past without noticing. \nAfter giving the trappers time to get around the next bend, Eric drives the Scout up the embankment and crosses back over the bridge. \n72   INT.  SCOUT \nEric stops the vehicle.  He grabs a five-gallon gas can and a piece of cloth from the back. \n73   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK \nThe prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the Army Corps of Engineers, left over from the building of the pipeline.  Eric stuffs the gas can between the abutment and the honeycombed underside of the bridge.  He puts the rag inside the spout of the can, lights it with a match and runs like hell back to the Scout. \n74   EXT.  HAUL ROAD \nThe trappers realize their quarry is missing.  Viking Bob slams on the brakes and looks around. \n75   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT) \nEric speeds away. CORBETT They'll still catch us.  All you're doing is pissing them off. \n76   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK \nThe gasoline can EXPLODES, tearing the bridge couplings away from the concrete abutment. \n77   EXT.  HAUL ROAD \nThe trappers see the explosion behind them.  They turn around and head toward it. \n78   EXT.  PUMPING STATION - HANGAR \nEric parks the Scout sideways to block the way to the airstrip. \nWith the magnum at the ready, Eric cuts Corbett's handcuffs loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar. \n", "test1_true": "79   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK \nThe trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge burning and disconnected from the creek bank. \n80   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA \nEric helps Corbett into the cockpit, then secures his handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope. \n81   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK \nViking Bob assesses the damage to the bridge.  Loose from the abutments, it wobbles like a diving board.  Below, the water is too deep and fast-moving to be traversable. \n82   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA \nEric tries to turn the ENGINE over.  The starter is sluggish from cold and lack of use. \n83   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK \nViking Bob looks at the others, bursting with frustration. He climbs into the driver's seat. VIKING BOB Get in.  We can jump it. \nThey hop in.  He SCREECHES backwards to get a running start, REVS the engine, pops the clutch, and tears toward the bridge. \nAs they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle under them.  With a sickening WRENCHING, the crossbar supports crumple. \nThe jeep flies through the still-burning gasoline, becomes airborne, and SCRAPES to a rude stop on the edge of the pavement on the other side, the back wheels dangling in space. \nLeMalle and Mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end of the jeep onto solid earth. \n84   INT.  HANGAR \nEric finally STARTS the plane and taxis out onto the landing strip. \n85   EXT.  PUMPING STATION \nThe trappers drive up to where the Scout blocks their path. They pile out of their jeep and run toward the landing strip. \n86   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT) \nIt picks up speed and takes off. \nANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT) \nBelow, the trappers watch the plane zoom over their heads. LeMalle points his carbine at it, but Viking Bob pushes the rifle down. \n87   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT) \nCorbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him. \n88   EXT.  PUMPING STATION \n", "test1_id": 465, "test2_input": "The men huddle inside the tarp.  Eric keeps a wary eye on Corbett -- at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake. Eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it.  It's swollen to the size of a softball. CORBETT Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron. (beat) Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze -- ERIC -- Turn around. \nWhile poking the .357 in Corbett's ribs, Eric one-handedly unlocks Corbett's right manacle, pulls his arm through the granite elbow, then locks it back up again.  He's learning. FADE TO: \n99   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - DREAM  - (AS IN SCENE 3) \nEric is hurrying along the pipeline in his business suit, following the predator's paw prints in the snow.  He peers ahead and his prey becomes visible.  But it isn't a wolf, it's Corbett.  His hands and face are covered in blood. END DREAM \n100  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAWN \nThe sun peeks over the mountain tops, drenching them with light and color. \n101  INT.  NYLON SHELTER \nThe light hits Eric's eyes.  He bolts awake from a fitful sleep.  Corbett sits, already awake, looking like he'd uproot the rock to which he's chained if he could.  He waits for an opportunity -- any opportunity -- with the patience of a vulture. CUT TO: \n102  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - SMALL VALLEY - DAY \nEric and Corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream bisecting their path.  It's simple -- to continue, they have to cross it.  Corbett takes in the scenery, in no particular hurry.  Frustrated, but making dead sure he's always got the drop on Corbett,  Eric puts a tentative foot on the ice. CORBETT Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath. ERIC We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it. CORBETT We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours. ERIC I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on. \nCorbett is not about to be outdone in the guts department by someone with a Master's Degree. CORBETT (gestures 'you first') Be my guest. ERIC (points .357) I'm right behind you. \nFrowning, Corbett tentatively steps onto the ice and inches across the fifteen feet to the other bank. \nNEW ANGLE \nHe turns and, indeed, Eric is right behind him. (CONTINUED) 102  CONTINUED: CORBETT Wait 'til I'm across! \nEric doesn't want to be too far from his prisoner.  He keeps coming.  The ice GROANS and HISSES under their weight. \nCorbett is three feet from solid ground.  He drops to his knees, then stomach, and rolls like a log the rest of the way. \nEric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across.  The ice makes an ominous CRACKING and water begins to seep through air holes. \nStanding, Corbett weighs his chances of bolting from Eric. \nEric crawls doubletime.  He makes it onto solid ground just as the ice under him breaks off in a big, thin, clear plate. \nCLOSER \nEric sits on some rocks.  Corbett glares it him. CORBETT Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself? ERIC It wasn't my idea to crash the plane. CORBETT Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner. ERIC (standing) We've got another two hours of daylight. CORBETT Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail. \nEric is not convinced.   Grumbling, Corbett gets up and takes the lead as they continue southward. \n103  INT.  THE TURTLE - DARKROOM - DAY \nTrying to keep busy, Anne Marie develops some prints in the darkroom she's made from the front bathroom.  She glances at her watch and sighs, her mind on Eric's overdue return. \n104  INT.  THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE \nAnne Marie comes out of the darkroom and hangs the prints up to dry.  Outside, (OS), a car HORN blares a couple of times. Grinning, she runs to the door. \n", "test2_true": "Meyerling's Dodge truck pulls up.  Anne Marie comes outside. Her smile wilts when she sees it's not Eric.  As Meyerling climbs the embankment to the Turtle, he glances at Wilder's snowmobile parked alongside the Turtle. MEYERLING I've been trying to raise you on the shortwave for two days. \nHe pushes past Anne Marie and goes into the Turtle. ANNE MARIE Have you talked to Eric? MEYERLING I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron? ANNE MARIE I was hoping you had some news -- \nMEYERLING -- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him -- ANNE MARIE -- Corbett's a killer. (CONTINUED) 105  CONTINUED: MEYERLING I don't care if Ben Corbett makes meatloaf out of nuns and babies, he's not your concern. Understood? \nAnne Marie just glares at him.  Meyerling examines the damaged shortwave. MEYERLING (continuing) What happened here? ANNE MARIE The radio's on the fritz. MEYERLING Where'd you say Eric is? ANNE MARIE Somewhere along the pipeline. MEYERLING What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess. ANNE MARIE Sam?  We haven't seen him. MEYERLING Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside. (beat) By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?' ANNE MARIE (blanching) Why? MEYERLING It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes. \nNoting Anne Marie's distressed reaction to this news, he crosses to the door. MEYERLING (continuing) Still nothing to tell me? (no reply) Suit yourself. \n106  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAY \nEric limps further down from the mountains.  Corbett keeps pace in front of him and his magnum.  As their altitude decreases, there is ever thicker vegetation. \nTheir tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the distance.  The magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings cannot be overstated.  Picture the most rustic, overwhelming wilderness imaginable, and then make it ten times larger. \nNEW ANGLE - LATER \nThe men's way is once again interrupted, this time by a sheer granite drop. The steep decline would be tough to negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear. Corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head. CORBETT Have to backtrack, find another way down. ERIC Forget it.  It would take days. CORBETT (assessing the drop) Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on. \nEric realizes he's right.  After some deliberation, Eric cautiously approaches him.  With the .357 cocked and ready, he undoes one of the cuffs, leaving them hanging from Corbett's wrist.  He then unthreads the nylon twine from Corbett's tarp. \nANGLE - GRANITE SHEER \nEric and Corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon rope.  Corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything. \nEric mimics Corbett's moves and follows the same path. Unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes his gloves off.  Continuing, he winces -- the rock is cold and sharp.  His hands are soon numb and bloody.  Even in the dry, below-freezing air, Eric is sweating. \nHe looks down and hangs on more tightly.  Sliding to level ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger. Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks.  Eric is right above him. (CONTINUED) 106  CONTINUED: \nSuddenly, Corbett's foot slips.  His right hand instinctively goes for a hold.  The dangling handcuffs snare on a protuberance, knocking him off balance. \nThe fulcrum of Corbett's body leans out into the empty air. Eric moves down a little, braces himself and extends his leg, giving Corbett something to grab.  Corbett takes hold of Eric's shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock wall.  Adrenaline screams through Eric's system. \nCorbett looks up at Eric.  A careless move will send them both tumbling.  Eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits for the worst. \nAfter a long moment, Corbett regains his balance and lets go of Eric's foot.  He continues his descent.  Eric lets out his breath and tries to swallow.  His mouth is as dry as the granite. CUT TO: \n107  EXT.  TREELINE - LATER THAT DAY \nHandcuffed again, Corbett hikes in front of Eric along the top of some foothills.  Now and again he glances behind, gauging Eric's weariness, waiting for a moment's carelessness.  Around them there is heavy vegetation now -- snow-covered sedge tussocks, knee-deep muskeg and twisted thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through. Above them, ominous clouds and sharp, cold winds are coming down from the north. \nBut below, a mile ahead, the edge of the forest is like the hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward. The combination of altitude and latitude creates an amazingly sharp topographical dividing line.  Within a few thousand yards, the landscape abruptly changes from scrub brush to thick coniferous forest. CORBETT Better get into those trees before that squall blows down. \nThen, Corbett pauses as a walloping sound ECHOES across the foothills. \nJust ahead, two enormous bull moose are fighting.  They ram each other with six-foot-wide antlers. \nCorbett stares, transfixed, admiring. CORBETT You talk about ecology -- there it is. (CONTINUED) 107  CONTINUED: \n", "test2_id": 466, "test3_input": "SNAP!  Viking Bob lets out a horrible HOWL and falls on his back in the snow.  Biting into his right calf is a huge conibear leg trap.  In extreme pain, he struggles to lever it open with the barrel of his rifle. \n201  EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE \nCorbett shoots Eric a dangerous look as Viking Bob's CRIES carry though the town. ERIC He'll live. \n202  EXT.  ALLEY \nHearing Viking Bob's cries, Mitchell backtracks and rushes to Viking Bob's aid.  Between them, they manage to yawn open the jaws of the trap and free Viking Bob's leg.  Viking Bob tries to walk but the leg won't support him -- the bone is broken.  Bitterly frustrated, he waves Mitchell on.  In agony, Viking Bob eases down in the snow.  He tears a strip of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the bleeding. \n203  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA \nAnne Marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip. Suddenly, the hot springs door bursts open and LeMalle lunges at her.  Stripped of his wet clothes, he's wrapped (CONTINUED) 203  CONTINUED: \nin blankets and furs, his feet protected by sacks lashed to them.  His wet body and hair steams in the frigid air. \nAnne Marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from him.  She falls hard on her back, knocking her wind out. Scrambling for footing in the snow, LeMalle drops his rifle. He comes at her again.  Anne Marie moves away and pulls the .44 magnum out.  LeMalle stops and glares at her. ANNE MARIE (gasping) Don't make me shoot. \nShe gets up, keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him. LeMalle glowers menacingly. ANNE MARIE (continuing) We're going to Sam's cabin.  You can stay in the jail until this is over. \nLeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle.  Anne Marie wields the handgun at him, but he doesn't stop. LEMALLE Want to chance it with that hog-leg?  You can't even hold it up.  Better drop me first shot, bitch, or I'll rip your fuckin' lungs out. \nTaunting, sneering, LeMalle stares her down.  Anne Marie is paralyzed.  Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bony fingers around the stock of the Remington. \nAnne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES.  Pulling the rifle close, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet.  Anne Marie FIRES again, and AGAIN.  Shot, LeMalle hobbles away, leaving a trail of blood in the snow.  Numb, Anne Marie lets her arm fall. \n204  EXT.  BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABIN \nEric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing the worst.  He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut across open ground toward the airstrip depot. \n205  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA \nKenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle's ransacking for things to wear.  Kenai turns, startled, when he hears footsteps.  It's Neff and Meyerling. (CONTINUED) 205  CONTINUED: KENAI (disgusted) Lookit this damn mess.  Where in hell's Wilder? NEFF (after a beat) Dead.  Trappers killed him. KENAI Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble. (to Meyerling) What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway? MEYERLING Hey, I thought you people loved Corbett and his wild men! KENAI This shoot-'em-up shit is bad for business.  I'm sick of it. MEYERLING What about you, Neff? NEFF Well... two of the trappers are down already -- MEYERLING (suddenly on the bandwagon) -- One left; three of us.  Let's finish it. NEFF What about Eric Desmond? MEYERLING I'll handle him. \n206  EXT.  YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT \nThrough the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of the plane on the runway.  He and Corbett hurry toward the back of the airstrip depot. \nAs they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Eric catches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED in a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper. (CONTINUED) 206  CONTINUED: \nERIC'S POV - REFLECTION \nPeacemaker in hand, Mitchell is behind the depot, coming right for them. \nWIDER \nEric takes out the homemade flashbomb.  He lights it, tosses it toward Mitchell and covers his eyes.  It EXPLODES with a muffled pop and a bright flash of white light. \nMitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes.  The flash has temporarily clouded his vision. \nEric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and waits for Mitchell to move on. \n", "test3_true": "Mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his shoulder stops him.  It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profuse bleeding from his right shoulder.  Mitchell blinks, still having trouble seeing.  LeMalle gestures for him to be quiet and points in Eric and Corbett's direction. LEMALLE (whispers) Over there... \nHe hoists his Remington. MITCHELL (whispers) Hold it.  You might hit Ben. LEMALLE Bullshit.  I hit what I'm aiming at. MITCHELL Let 'em come closer first... \nBut LeMalle is too anxious.  He swings the rifle up, left-handed, and SHOOTS. \nNEW ANGLE \nThe bullet just misses Eric.  He panics and wildly returns FIRE with the .357. \n208  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT \nMitchell and LeMalle scatter under the hail of bullets. (CONTINUED) 208  CONTINUED: \nANGLE ON ERIC AND CORBETT \nas they HEAR LeMalle's labored footsteps run past them, nearby.  Eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the depot.  There is no further movement. \nEric waits a moment, then leads Corbett cautiously toward the depot. \n209  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT \nReaching the rear wall, they practically stumble over something.  It's Mitchell, lying on the ground near the wall, badly wounded by Eric's barrage.  Eric gasps. Anguished, Corbett kneels next to Mitchell.  Mitchell pulls him closer. MITCHELL Glad to see you're okay.  I told LeMalle not to shoot. (tries to smile) Had some fine seasons, didn't we... \nMitchell's grasp on Corbett's coat relaxes as he dies. Horrified, Eric stares at the man he killed.  Noticing the scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchell's pocket, Corbett picks it up. CORBETT (to Eric) Fifteen years on the trail with this man, I never saw him rise to anger. \nGlaring at Eric, Corbett dips his hand in Mitchell's blood, and suddenly smears it across Eric's mouth.  Repelled, Eric pulls back. CORBETT (continuing; bitterly) Your first kill.  How does it taste? \nWiping his face, sickened and desolate, Eric has no reply. \nWIDER \nThen, from somewhere close by, LeMalle FIRES at them.  Eric stuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the padlock off the back door of the depot.  He pushes Corbett inside. \n210  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT \nThe pony-tailed, ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off and removes his Walkman headphones.  Hearing LeMalle's continuing GUNSHOTS, the Pilot pulls his door closed and turns on his two-way radio. PILOT (into radio mic) Circle, this is BMY-955.  I just touched down in Devil's Cauldron. Nobody's here to greet me like usual, and there's gunfire.  I'm getting scarce. \nWith that, he STARTS his engines up again. \nCUT TO ERIC IN DEPOT \nwho turns, startled, when he hears the ENGINES coughing to life OS. \n211  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT \nThe Pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take off.  He looks up, surprised, as the passenger door suddenly opens. \nWIDER \n", "test3_id": 467}

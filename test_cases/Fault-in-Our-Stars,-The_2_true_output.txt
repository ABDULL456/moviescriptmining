WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Are they here, Peter? So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it. 
MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.) There are two -- 
(BEAT) Who the hell's "they?" 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) They are Augustus and Hazel, the young fans with whom you've been corresponding. Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will help things take a turn for the better. 
MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.) The Americans? 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) You invited them, remember? 
MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.) You know why I left America, Lidewij? To never have to encounter Americans. Get rid of them. Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible! 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) I will not do this Peter. Be nice. At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel. And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat, two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally: 
VAN HOUTEN Which of you is Augustus Waters? Gus raises his hand tentatively. Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar. 
LIDEWIJ Please. I am sorry. Come in. Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes a step. Hazel follows. They walk: 
INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAME Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it. Van Houten sits in the chair. Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and twist-tied. 
HAZEL Trash? 
LIDEWIJ Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never opens it. Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch. 
VAN HOUTEN Yours are the first missives to which I've replied and look where that got me. Hazel and Gus take their seats. 
VAN HOUTEN Scotch? 
HAZEL Um, no thanks. 
VAN HOUTEN Augustus Waters? 
GUS It's 11am. 
VAN HOUTEN Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and soda. 
LIDEWIJ Perhaps some breakfast first Peter? 
VAN HOUTEN She thinks I have a drinking problem. 
LIDEWIJ I also think the Earth is round. Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight. 
VAN HOUTEN So you like my book. 
HAZEL Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made meeting you his Wish so that we could come here and talk to you. Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink. 
VAN HOUTEN Did you dress like her on purpose? 
HAZEL (looks at her shirt) Kinda. 
Van Houten says nothing to that. 
VAN HOUTEN I do not have a drinking problem. I have a Churchillian relationship with alcohol: I can crack jokes and govern England and do anything I want to do. Except not drink. He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass. 
GUS Incidentally, thank you for dinner last night. 
VAN HOUTEN 
(TO LIDEWIJ) We bought them dinner last night? 
LIDEWIJ It was our pleasure. 
VAN HOUTEN 
(SIGHS) You've come a long way so... what is it I can do for you?

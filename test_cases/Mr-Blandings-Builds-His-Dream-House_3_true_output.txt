SOUND of doorbell ringing. 
MURIEL Darling, please! (changing subject) Children, you'll be late to school. Run along and -- 
The children rise, pick up their school paraphernalia. 
JOAN Miss Stellwagon says that functionalism in modern furniture -- 
MURIEL Never mind, dear. 
She hustles Betsy and Joan toward the foyer as Jim rises. 
INT. FOYER 
Gussie has just admitted Mr. Funkhauser. He is a tall, slender, effete-looking, young man. He is loaded down with sketches, samples of wallpaper, bolts of material. Betsy and Joan brush by him on their way out. 
FUNKHAUSER Good morning. 
THE GIRLS (with a sharp appraising look) Hi. 
As they rush out and the door closes, Jim and Muriel enter scene. 
MURIEL Good morning, Mr. Funkhauser. You remember Mr. Blandings? 
FUNKHAUSER But of course. 
He sweeps by them into the living room, taking over completely. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
FUNKHAUSER You'll have to pardon my bursting in at this dreary hour -- (puts a sketch on a chair) -- practically the middle of the night -- (puts wallpaper against mantel) -- but I did so want to catch you in. I've been at it hammer and tongs all week and I'm just a mess -- (drapes bolt of chintz over high-backed chair) -- but then Muriel and I thought we ought to talk it over with you before we take the plunge... 
Funkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to display his last bolt of chintz, finds none, settles for Jim's shoulder over which he drapes the cloth, the folds flowing down in front. As Jim reacts: 
FUNKHAUSER (smoothing out folds on the chintz) After all, it's your home, too, and it should reflect you. You know, Man's Castle, all that sort of thing. 
Jim looks down at the chintz. 
JIM (ominously) Muriel! 
MURIEL (quickly) Jim, just wait till you hear. He's got some wonderful ideas for the foyer. 
FUNKHAUSER Oh, that's out! All out! Changed the whole thing! I just couldn't live with it! I said to myself, "Bunny, what are the Blandings? How shall we do them?" And the answer was perfectly obvious. Very American, very grass roots, very blueberry pie -- that sort of thing. 
JIM (dark look at Muriel) Mm. 
Funkhauser fingers the material of a drape, disdainfully removes his hand. 
FUNKHAUSER Now first, let's dig into this living room of yours, it's really a dreary. 
MURIEL (quickly; to Jim) We want this room to be very gay, dear. Something in bright reds, yellows and greens. 
JIM (appalled) Red, yellow and green?! 
FUNKHAUSER Oh, come, Mr. Blandings, let's not run away from color. 
JIM Not running away -- (a lame joke) -- just backing off a little. 
FUNKHAUSER Uh -- yes. (brightly) Now as I see our room, it's definitely Colonial. You know, cobbler's bench, breakfront, pie cooler, student lamp, hooked rug. But everything in good taste. It must not jump out at you and scream: "Look -- see how antique I am!" 
JIM Heaven forbid. 
FUNKHAUSER Of course, these things take imagination. You've simply got to be able to visualize. 
JIM (politely, removing chintz) If you'll forgive me, Mr. Funkhauser, what I'd like to visualize -- at this dreary hour -- is how much is this all going to cost? 
FUNKHAUSER Well, really, I hesitate to say. After all -- (indicates) -- by the time this wall is out we may find -- 
JIM (reacting) This wall is -- what? 
FUNKHAUSER Out. Source of light is from the east. Obviously if our room is to have any function at all -- 
JIM You're going to tear out the wall?! 
MURIEL Dear, it's a wonderful notion. 
FUNKHAUSER Visualize three feet of leaded panes, the rest -- 
JIM Can you give me a figure? 
FUNKHAUSER Well! Costs aren't what they used to be, you know, and -- 
JIM Just a figure. 
FUNKHAUSER Materials are impossible, labor has just run wild --

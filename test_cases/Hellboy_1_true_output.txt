HELLBOY Sebastian Plackba #16... 
19TH CENTURY CEMETERY (MATTE SHOT / COMPOSITE) 
Broken spiked fences succumb to rust and dead vines. Endless rows of crypts and tombstones poke through wild foliage. 
Our group plus TWO AGENTS (Lime and Stone) venture into the labyrinthine lanes of the dead. Each carries a backpack, a flashlight and a gun. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CEMETERY - MAUSOLEUM SECTION (LOCATION) - DAY 
Later. The group gathers in frustration in an area of baroque funerary monuments. Myers -- carrying the explosive belts -- looks around. 
MANNING Forget it. This is practically a city. And it stinks, and it's muddy. We'll go back, check into a hotel, regroup after breakfast. We'll have to make a grid, go by quadrants. Maybe satellite photography. 
He gestures and all the agents head for the vans. 
HELLBOY Let me ask for directions. 
EXT. OPEN GRAVE - DAY 
The group surrounds a grave. Hellboy raises the broken stone cover and then jumps in. 
EXT. OPEN GRAVE (SET) - DAY 
-- and lands on a rotten coffin. In it, a mummified corpse lies in a miserable black suit. 
HELLBOY (whispers) Animam edere, animus corpus... 
He presses the amulet on the cadaver's forehead. For a moment, nothing, and then... 
...a brutal spasm!! The corpse gasps, breathes... and mutters something in tongueless Russian. SUBTITLE: WHAT DO YOU WANT? 
EXT. MOSCOW CEMETERY (LOCATION) - DAY 
The group gawks as Hellboy climbs out, carrying the CORPSE on his back. With an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team. 
HELLBOY Sixty feet further, comrades, and three rows in... 
The corpse fidgets on Hellboy's back. Its bony hand weakly points, as if in confirmation. 
HELLBOY This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say "hi" Ivan. 
The corpse mutters again. SUBTITLED: GO THAT WAY, RED MONKEY. 
EXT. CEMETERY - YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM (LOCATION) - DAY 
A miniature black marble castle. Using a crowbar, Myers pries open the ancient steel door. Hellboy, still carrying the desiccated abomination on his back, walks in. 
OMIT 
INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM STAIRS - LATER - DAY 
Two agents stand guard in the mausoleum, while the group descends carefully. The walls are dotted with yellowed skulls. 
INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM - UNDERGROUND - STAIRCASE 
Myers' flashlight flickers. He shakes it back to life. 
INT. UNDERGROUND - UNDERGROUND INTERSECTION 
They reach the bottom of the staircase: three corridors branch off in different directions. Hellboy deposits the CORPSE attop a pile of coffins. 
HELLBOY We'll be alright... as long as we don't separate -- 
INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR AND INTERSECTION - DAY 
TCHKANGGG!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below, blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and ramming Stone: he's gone. 
Wicked spikes cover the metal surface. Hellboy still bangs on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. Liz and Myers are on the other side. 
HELLBOY (into his walkie-talkie) Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything... 
LIZ Marco... 
HELLBOY ...Polo. 
On the other side of the panel, Myers takes the radio from Liz. 
MYERS (into radio) Are you sure about this? 
HELLBOY On a scale of one to ten: two. But -- (beat) -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one. 
Liz and Myers move off. Hellboy shines his light down the tunnel on the left. Agent Lime picks up the corpse and follows. 
INT. TUNNEL "A" / CHAMBER - DAY 
Hellboy and Manning come into a vast chamber: Slavic motifs crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. Water runs down the walls.

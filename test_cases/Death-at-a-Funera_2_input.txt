OSCAR Thank you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DUNCAN (O.S.) Elaine! Elaine opens the bathroom door and Duncan enters. Elaine helps Oscar get dressed. 
DUNCAN (CONT'D) 
(TO ELAINE) Thank God you're safe. 
(TO OSCAR) You idiot! What the hell is wrong with you? Stay away from my daughter. 
ELAINE Look, Dad-- 
DUNCAN Elaine, stay out of this. 
ELAINE No, I'm not staying out of this. Remember how I told you we were moving in together? Well, I lied. We're getting married. Duncan is shocked. 
DUNCAN You're what?! 
ELAINE We're getting married. 
DUNCAN Elaine, you don't have to marry him just because you're pregnant. 
ELAINE I'm not marrying him because I'm pregnant. I'm marrying him because I love him. 
DUNCAN How can you love him? He's an idiot. 
ELAINE Dad, this is my life. If you don't like it, too bad. But if you want to keep me and my child in your life, you'd better change your attitude, especially about my husband. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Elaine exits, taking Oscar with her. 
OSCAR Bye, Dad. They exit. 
EXT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Cynthia walks up to Aaron. 
CYNTHIA Baby, I really think we should start again now. Have you seen Uncle Russell? Aaron remembers where he is and looks at Ryan. They rush off to the study, passing Jeff. Jeff checks his pockets and realizes the pills are gone again. He goes off to find them. 
INT. STUDY - DAY 
Aaron and Ryan enter the study and head toward the closed bathroom door. They open it and find Uncle Russell sitting on the toilet. 
UNCLE RUSSELL What the hell is going on in this place? 
AARON I'm so sorry, Uncle Russell. There was someone on the roof-- 
UNCLE RUSSELL Never mind that. What about that dead body you dragged in here? Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance. 
AARON What dead body? 
UNCLE RUSSELL Don't mess with me. I know a dead body when I see one. I live in a retirement home. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Norman sniffs his fingers, worried. In the background we see Elaine entering the room with Oscar, now dressed, but still looking a bit wired. People respond with scattered applause and congratulations. Derek walks over and joins Norman. 
DEREK Did you hear that? She's having a kid! Derek looks at Norman who's looking sort of distant. 
DEREK (CONT'D) How's your skin thing? 
NORMAN Oh that... It's probably nothing. I'm more worried about Hepatitis C after having Uncle Russell's shit in my mouth. I think I'm feeling yellow. Norman touches his skin as he walks away, leaving Derek confused. ANGLE ON: Jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle. He gives up and sits in a chair. ANGLE ON: Ryan is wheeling Uncle Russell into the room as Aaron moves to his seat. 
UNCLE RUSSELL I'm telling you I saw the guy. He was dead! 
RYAN I know you did, Russell. We all did. 
UNCLE RUSSELL No! In the bathroom. Ryan offers a look to the other mourners indicating that Uncle Russell's a bit mad and shouldn't be listened to. ANGLE ON: Michelle comes over to Aaron. 
AARON I can't believe what a nightmare today has been. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MICHELLE I don't know. It's been sort of exciting. Aaron looks at her.

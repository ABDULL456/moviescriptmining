THUNK -- The mallet strikes. 
TEDDY (on the air) Base hit centerfield off LaLoosh... 
HIS ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE) SCRAWLS another quick note. 
THUNK THUNK THUNK -- A rapid sequence of the mallet striking the percussive box, and: 
TEDDY (on the air) That closes the book on LaLoosh today, 5 earned runs, 5 hits, 5 strikeouts, 5 walks, 5 wild pitches... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GREENSBORO BALLPARK -- DAY 
SKIP REMOVES NUKE FROM THE GAME and he heads for the showers. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANNIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY 
ANNIE SITS WITH MILLIE at the kitchen table, listening to the radio. Annie sighs. Millie consoles her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GREENSBORO LOCKER ROOM -- DAY 
NUKE IN THE SHOWERS ALONE -- Letting the water run over him. 
The voice of Teddy an the air, editorializing shamelessly. 
TEDDY (on the air) It's time to tell it like it is, sports fans -- and this is the most wretched road trip I've seen in 20 years, and possibly the worst Durham team in half a century. (beat) Where are the great Bull players of yesteryear? Where are the Footsie Blakes, the Digger O'Dells, the Gus Palowitzes? 
TEDDY'S VOICE PLAYS OVER road trip images: 
NUKE STARTS TO PUT ON THE RED PANTIES -- Changes his mind, and hides them again. 
THE TEAM BUS rolling across North Carolina. 
THE TEAM BUS at a drive through hamburger stand somewhere in the Smoky Mountains.  Sack after sack of fast food is passed through the window to Skip. 
THE TEAM BUS PULLS INTO YET ANOTHER HOTEL and this time, a Bus with a sign -- "Holiday on Ice" pulls in next to them. 
TEDDY (on the air) Is the modern athlete a pale imitation of the great old warriors? Only Crash Davis stands out this year, begging the question, "What are these boys thinking about, 'cause it sure ain't baseball". 
CUT TO: 
EXT/INT. THE BUS IN FRONT OF THE KINGSTON HOTEL -- NIGHT 
As the players rise in the bus, Deke is trying to work up excitement about the "Holiday on Ice" bus from which twenty great looking women ice skaters are getting off. 
P.O.V.  HOLIDAY ON ICE GIRLS getting off the bus. 
TONY Ice skaters. God. Look't em. that's what we need, y'know -- one night with some skaters and we can get back on track... 
DEKE We need a night off just to stop our losing streak. We need a rainout. 
CRASH I can get us a rainout. 
MICKEY It's 90 degrees, there ain't been a cloud in the sky in weeks. 
CRASH Hundred bucks says I can get us a rainout tomorrow. 
TONY You're on. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. KINGSTON BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT 
A CAB PULLS UP in the dark. Late at night. The cab leaves, and the four men climb over the fence. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. INSIDE THE KINGSTON BALLPARK -- NIGHT 
CRASH PULLS THE LID OFF A BOX -- Several valve handles. 
Crash turns several handles with an iron bar, and... 
THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM COMES TO LIFE -- And suddenly the field is covered with the clicking of rain-bird sprinklers, throwing long slow arcs of water across the entire field. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE SCOREBOARD OF THE BALLPARK -- MINUTES LATER -- NIGHT 
THE FOUR PLAYERS sit on the scoreboard, watching the sprinklers flood the field. A six-pack is passed around. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE BALLPARK -- EARLY THE NEXT MORNING 
A QUAGMIRE ON THE INFIELD -- The Kingston GENERAL MANAGER stands in the muck with his ground crew. Wheelbarrows, shovels, sand is piled around. It's hopeless. 
KINGSTON G.M. God damn it! Vandals. Damn kids! 
GROUND CREW MEMBER We can't get it ready by game time, boss.

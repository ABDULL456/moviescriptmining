{"test1_input": "THE POSTMAN \nscreenplay by \nBrian Helgeland and Eric Roth \nbased on the novel by \nDavid Brin \nNovember 4, 1996 \nEarly Production Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE (UTAH) - DAY                            1 \nJagged mountains defy a dark, foreboding sky. We hear PLODDING HOOVES, CREAKING LEATHER. A lone wanderer appears. Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he carries a bolt-action carbine. His name forgotten, history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN. \nHis laden pack mule, BILL, BRAYS, as they pass a battered sign: \"The Great Salt Lake Marina.\" They start down a slope and begin to cross a... \nDRY LAKE BED \nA bizarre, wind-swept sight. Dozens of boats resting lee- to on the dry, cracked earth. It's like God pulled the plug. Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two. \nWOMAN (V.O.) The last of the great cities died when my father was a child. Another victim of yet another war. The plagues followed. And the terrors. The living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained. The Earth itself had fallen prey to chaos. For three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase. The ocean was barren. Poisoned. Near death. \nAs The Postman continues to cross, the CAMERA PULLS BACK. He's soon lost in the massive vista. \nWOMAN (V.O.) Sixteen long years passed before the great lungs started working again. My father said it was as if the ocean breathed a great sigh of relief... \nA RUMBLE of THUNDER. RAIN begins to fall. The earth just sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. Rivulets run. Puddles form. We begin to get the feeling that soon these boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                   1 \nTRACK a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the sand. And then, running to fill another in a series of depressions. They make a pattern we recognize as -- \nMAN'S FOOTPRINTS \nThese tracks may already be days old as they fill with rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS. A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low, disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner plans -- for now. \n2   EXT. HIGHWAY ON-RAMP (UTAH) - DAY                            2 \nA bullet-ridden sign reads: \"U.S. 84 North.\" The Postman leads Bill down a barren 4-lane. Weeds poke up through the asphalt. The rusting hulk of a car rests in the median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. The Postman plucks a flower. He sticks it into a buttonhole and continues. \nBILL BRAYS woefully.    In answer: \nTHE POSTMAN I don't know. And if you ask me again, I'm going to slug you. \nThey near a sign: \"Thank You For Visiting Utah.\" The Postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it. \nTHE POSTMAN It's been fun, hasn't it, kids? (to the sign) You're welcome! \n3   EXT. 4-LANE (IDAHO) - BILLBOARD - DAY                        3 \nBill tugs up weeds as The Postman is climbing up a ladder on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon. \nAbove, The Postman sands atop a billboard catwalk. He references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon through binoculars with one broken lens. He pauses at a Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line. \n4   EXT. HIGHWAY TRAVEL STOP (IDAHO) - DAY                        4 \nA 76 Station and the remains of a Howard Johnson's. Alert, carbine in hand, The Postman leads in the mule. Rusting cars sag on flattened tires. There's a stripped fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo foundation which bristles with burned timbers. \nBill stops to drink out of a stream.   The Postman swats at him with his hat. \nTHE POSTMAN Damnit, Bill, you know I need to check it first! \nBill hangs his head. The Postman digs through his pack. He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several small bottles -- with stream water. He adds a few drops from each bottle. Swirls it around. Then dips a tiny strip of paper into the water. The paper turns a vivid purple. The Postman is dubious. \nTHE POSTMAN Better than turpentine. (touches some to his lips) Tastes about the same. Your call, Bill. \nBill drinks. \nTHE POSTMAN You ain't picky, Bill. I like that about you. \nThe Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and crosses to the 76 Station. An old extension ladder on the ground. The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over. Beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the 20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color before. \nThe Postman tries the station door. Locked. Smiling ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window. \n5   INT. 76 STATION - OFFICE - DAY                                5 \nA shambles. The Postman kicks around the table. He finds a few beat-up CDs, flips through them. Reads the label. \n(CONTINUED) \n5   CONTINUED:                                                      5 \nTHE POSTMAN 'Running on Empty'? Tell me about it. \nTossing it, he turns, stops. There, resting on a pile of trash is a bashed-in portable TV. The Postman smiles. \nTHE POSTMAN Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147 channels. Everything from Jesus to 'Jeopardy'. \nHe steps over, switches on the set.      Nothing happens, but The Postman pretends just the same.      He mimics static, then: \nTHE POSTMAN 'Like sands through the hour- glass, so are the days of our lives...' (switching channels) 'Michael Shields, come on down, you're the next contestant on...'The Price is Right'.' (switching again) I'll take Domestic Nuclear Disasters for two hundred thousand, Alex... \nThe Postman stops suddenly.    Click. \nTHE POSTMAN We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the Second Civil War... Well, shit. \nThe Postman stares at the blank screen a moment. There's a sudden, panicked RUSTLING from behind the service manager's desk. The Postman wheels around, raises the carbine. \nTHE POSTMAN I don't want any trouble... I bet you don't either... Let's just call it a draw, okay? \n", "test1_true": "THE POSTMAN Look out, Bill! \n(CONTINUED) \n5   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               5 \nThe doe bolts for the window and runs right into Bill. Bill has a conniption fit. \nInvestigating further, The Postman spots a cigarette machine. The front glass is smashed and all the slots are empty. But he looks down to the lock at the bottom. It's intact. He pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls. \nThe panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of cigarettes. He doesn't believe it for a second. Then: \nTHE POSTMAN I'm rich. \n6   EXT. 76 STATION - NIGHT                                         6 \nEmbers of a campfire glow.    The Postman is asleep, the carbine in reach. \nBILL BRAYS and nervously stamps his hooves. The Postman reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a shotgun pointed in his face. \nThree BANDITS! Hard-eyed and ugly. One, barely 20, is mostly just ugly. The Postman looks down the barrels of a shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. The LEAD BANDIT kicks the carbine out of reach. \nTHE POSTMAN I'm just passing through. I don't mean anyone any harm. (re: stream) Water's good. \nThe Lead Bandit pokes at The Postman's shoulder with the muzzle of his rifle. The Postman knows why. \nTHE POSTMAN I'm not a Holnist. \nThe Lead Bandit pokes again. Harder. The Postman opens his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder. \nTHE POSTMAN Okay? \nThey just stare at him, none saying a word.      Creepy. \nTHE POSTMAN I'm headed for a town called St. Rose. Somewhere west of Portland. \n(CONTINUED) \n6   CONTINUED:                                                     6 \nLEAD BANDIT Portland's under twenty feet of water. \nTHE POSTMAN Well, I heard different. \nLEAD BANDIT You mouthin' me? \nTHE POSTMAN No, it's just that it's hard to get good information. \nThe third BANDIT, a HULKING brute, has been quiet. \nHULKING BANDIT He is mouthin' you; I say we kill him. \nLEAD BANDIT Don't be in such a rush, Martin. (back to The Postman) Now I see a pack mule over there, but I don't see no packs. \nTHE POSTMAN This is all I got. \nLEAD BANDIT Oh... Kill him, Martin. \nThe Hulking Bandit, raises his shotgun. The butt end. He's going to bludgeon The Postman to death. \nTHE POSTMAN (pointing) Okay!   My stuff's up there! \nThe 76 ball is twenty feet above the ground. In the gloom you can just see a hole has been punched through the side. \nBANDIT #20 What do you got in there? \nThe Lead Bandit swats Bandit #20 upside the head. \nLEAD BANDIT Shut up. (to Postman) What do you got in there? \n(CONTINUED) \n6   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               6 \nTHE POSTMAN Dried peas.   Beef jerky. Cigarettes. \nALL THREE BANDITS Cigarettes! \nTHE POSTMAN Sure.   There's the ladder. \nBANDIT #20 Maybe he's got it booby-trapped. \nThe Lead Bandit is about to smack Bandit #20 again -- then he sees the logic out of it. The Postman shakes his head, but isn't that convincing. \nLEAD BANDIT You go up and get it. \nCUT TO: \n7   EXT. 76 BALL - DAWN                                             7 \nThe ladder set against the bent pole. Prodded by a shotgun, The Postman climbs, disappears through the hole and into the tilting 76 ball. \n8   INT. 76 BALL - DAWN                                             8 \nFull of The Postman's earthly possessions. Trick is, how to save them and his life at the same time. He spies an old wrench: remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty bolts holding the ball in place. An idea begins to take shape. \nLEAD BANDIT (O.S.) Just you start tossing those cigarettes down! \nBANDITS \nThere's no answer.     The Bandits eye each other nervously. \nBANDIT #20 Maybe he fell asleep. \n(CONTINUED) \n8   CONTINUED:                                                     8 \n", "test1_id": 2406, "test2_input": "THE POSTMAN You'd meet a lot of people who don't believe in you. \nFORD I'll set them straight. \nTHE POSTMAN It's a lonely job. \nFORD I've been lonely all my life. \nThis response strikes a chord. The Postman sees how badly Ford wants something to hold onto. He sees himself. \nTHE POSTMAN So have I, Ford. So have I. \nThe Postman looks up at the creed on the wall.    Finally... \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                38 \nTHE POSTMAN What the hell?     Repeat after me. \nPOSTMAN/FORD (repeating) Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds. \nTHE POSTMAN Okay then. \nFORD (repeating) Okay, then. \nTHE POSTMAN No, no, no, I'm saying that. You just listen... By my authority you are now empowered to carry the mail. (extends a hand) Congratulations, you're a postman. \nThey shake hands. The Postman doesn't realize, but this is the most important moment in Ford's life. \nFORD I want you to know I'd die to get a letter through. \nFord's intensity takes The Postman back.       But the moment is broken when... \nBRISCOE (O.S.) Johnny, why don't you run along. I need to speak to this man. \nFord bristles at \"Johnny,\" looks to The Postman. \nFORD I'll see you around. \nTHE POSTMAN Sure thing, Ford. \nFord exits. \nBRISCOE Johnny's real impressed with you. Whole town's real impressed with you. \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              38 \nTHE POSTMAN I take it you're not. \nBRISCOE Smarter than you look. \nTHE POSTMAN What can I do for you, Sheriff? \nBRISCOE You can clear out. Or I can throw you out. Either way suits me fine. \nTHE POSTMAN I'm afraid you don't understand, Sheriff. I'm a government employee. Authorized by -- \nBRISCOE You're not authorized by shit. You're nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail. And I want you out of my town. \nTHE POSTMAN This is going in my report. \nBRISCOE These people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman. They need something real. They need help with the goddamn Holnists. Are you going to bring them that? (as The Postman doesn't answer) Didn't think so. All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts. I aim to keep it that way. You can stay till morning. Then I don't ever want to see you again. \nBriscoe exits, leaves The Postman alone in the post office. \n39   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                          39 \nThe Postman arrives home. He pushes open the door, knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved under the door. He gathers them up, flips through them. They're written on scraps, the backs of pictures, on handkerchiefs and homemade paper. They aren't old. \n(CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                                       39 \nThey're brand new.      Shaking his head, he closes the door. \nThe Postman has no sooner done so when there's a KNOCK on the window. He looks over at a woman. She shrugs, smiles, holds up a letter. The Postman sighs; he's trapped in here. \n40   EXT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - NIGHT                                     40 \nCAMERA STARTS ON a man with a string-tied package crossing the streets and DRIFTS TO the abandoned car where Ford lives. He's home. \nON FORD \nConcentrating, Ford holds a needle and thread and a piece of cloth on which he's drawn an approximation of the post office shoulder patch. By moonlight he embroiders it in. Not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either. \n41   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - CLOSE ON STRING-TIED             41 PACKAGE - NIGHT \n~from the previous scene.       It's on the table with a growing stack of mail. \nThe Postman is in bed, trying to sleep. But it's hard- coming. He laces his fingers behind his head, stares up at the moon through a hole in the wall. A KNOCK at the door. \nTHE POSTMAN Just leave it. \nThere's a pause.    And then, ANOTHER KNOCK. \nTHE POSTMAN I said leave it. \nThe door opens. Surprise. Abby stands in the doorway, her hair held up by an old red ribbon. He sits up. \nTHE POSTMAN Hello, Abby. \nABBY You'll be leaving tomorrow? \nTHE POSTMAN I guess. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test2_true": "ABBY (enters; closes door) Everybody's up late writing letters for you to take. We're not supposed to waste candles like that, but they're so excited. \nTHE POSTMAN How about you?     Do you have a letter? \nABBY I don't have anybody to write to. \nTHE POSTMAN I'll find you a pen pal. Someone with interests similar to your own. Dancing, checking for mumps. \nAbby laughs.    The Postman is charmed. \nABBY You're funny. Hardly anyone's funny around here. \nTHE POSTMAN I guess no one feels much like laughing. \nThe two of them just look at each other a moment.         Abby fingers the ribbon in her hair. \nABBY Have you decided yet? \nTHE POSTMAN Oh, well, I've been thinking about it. \nA beat. Abby lets her shift drop to the floor, then slides under the sheets alongside him. \nTHE POSTMAN Sure.   Why not? \nThey lie there awkwardly for a moment.          He looks at her. \nTHE POSTMAN God, you're beautiful. Sorry, I know you'd probably like to keep things more clinical. (beat) You don't even know my name. \n(CONTINUED) \n41   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 41 \nShe shushes him, covers his mouth with her hand. \nABBY I don't want to. \nHe nods he understands.     She stares into his eyes. \nABBY It would be easier for me if you closed your eyes. \nThe Postman closes his eyes. Abby slides her hand away from his mouth. And as they start to make love... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n42   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - DAY                               42 \nThe Postman wakes, reaches for the warm body that was there last night. But Abby is gone. All that's left behind is her red ribbon. Wistful, he picks it up. \n43   EXT. ABANDONED HOTEL - DAY                                        43 \nThe Postman exits. In uniform, his bag slung over his shoulder. He starts then stops short. Only now do we see most of the townspeople have silently assembled here. They've been waiting for him, starving for him. \nFord steps up, hands him another fresh packet of letters. The Postman sees that Ford hangs on to four or five. \nTHE POSTMAN What about those? \nFORD These are going to Blue Jay. About twenty miles east. I thought I could take them. \nThe Postman scans the crowd.      Looking for Abby maybe? \nTHE POSTMAN (absently) Okay.   They're yours. \nBriscoe rides up, regards The Postman sternly. \nBRISCOE I'm your escort out of town. \nSome of the town's CITIZENS lead up a saddled mare. \n(CONTINUED) \n43   CONTINUED:                                                    43 \nCITIZEN #1 We took a vote, Mr. Postman.   We want you to have this horse. \nCITIZEN #2 Now don't say no. A man on horseback can cover ten times the territory of a man on foot. \nTHE POSTMAN (smiles at Briscoe) I'll take it. \nHe ties his mailbag to the saddle, swings himself up. \nCITIZEN #3 There's a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations. \nTHE POSTMAN Thank you. \nCITIZEN #1 Where do you figure you'll go from here? \nTHE POSTMAN Go?... Oh yeah... I'll head west, then work my way back here in a sort of figure eight. \n\"8.\" Everyone's quiet a moment. They shift uncomfortably. The Postman looks out at the crowd. They crave hope. He should probably just keep his mouth shut. \nTHE POSTMAN Times seem hard right now. But you have to believe it's getting better. Birds are migrating again. The rains are back. \nThe people consider him and then each other. By God, they do feel hopeful. Suddenly, Ellen, her little boy by her side, begins to sing. It's weak at first, but one-by-one the others join in. Soon the whole town is singing: \nELLEN & TOWN 'Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain. For purple mountain's majesty, above the fruited plain. America...' \nThe Postman looks around. They sing their hearts out. The guilt is overwhelming. He digs his heels into the horse's flanks and rides out of town. \n44   EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - DAY                        44 \nPeople line the top as The Postman and Briscoe ride out. The strains of \"AMERICA\" still in the background. \nBRISCOE You got a helluva nerve, whoever you are. \nThe Postman doesn't rise to the bait. \nTHE POSTMAN Is Abby around? \n", "test2_id": 2407, "test3_input": "BRISCOE She and Michael are working the north meadow this morning. \nBriscoe reins up -- he's gone as far as his duty commands. \nBRISCOE Well, you're on your own. \nThe Postman tips his cap and continues riding by \"Pine View - Population 132.\" Briscoe watches a moment, then calls after him: \nBRISCOE Hey! Are you really who you say you are? \nTHE POSTMAN If I come back with some mail, you'll know! \nThe Postman continues. Caught in an inner turmoil, Briscoe reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a letter. He turns it over in his hands, looks off at The Postman. \nBRISCOE God damn it! \nBriscoe urges his horse forward, catches up. He hands The Postman the letter, then rides back for town. The Postman watches Briscoe. The people lining the wall. And he realizes just what effect he's had. There's nothing to do, but shrug his shoulders and ride. Strains of \"AMERICA\" still ECHO hauntingly OVER: \n45   EXT. ON ROAD - SUN                                           45 \nA green and lavender sunset.

He just begins to tear the corner, then stops. \nTHE POSTMAN Maybe one thing can still be sacred. (to horse) All in all, not a bad gig, huh? \nThe HORSE SNORTS. Smiling, The Postman shoves the envelope into his bag. As he does, he finds something else. The red ribbon. He runs it through his fingers, thinks wistfully of Abby. Then, like a knight of old representing a lady's honor, he ties it to his mailbag and rides on. \n46   EXT. WELL (PINE VIEW) - DAY                                    46 \nAbby's washing clothes with a tub and washboard. Waging war on dirt. Michael leans against a tree, watches Abby at work until she notices him. She wipes the sweat from her brow, tries not to smile. \nABBY What are you looking at? \nMICHAEL Everything. \nHe steps over and they're in each other's arms. This is love. But as Michael kisses her, we hear a familiar alarm: \nSENTRY Holnists!    Holnists are coming! \n47   EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - DAY                          47 \nLed by Bethlehem and Getty, the soldiers ride in.

You gotta stay out of sight. \nFORD I'm a postman. And I'm not hiding from anyone.

That flag is an abomination. \nBriscoe steps forward, attempts to diffuse the situation. \n", "test3_true": "Bethlehem decides not to kill anyone, looks to Getty. \nBETHLEHEM Make sure that fire doesn't go out. \nThe General joins Briscoe. \nTears on his cheeks, Ford watches the post office burn. \n50   EXT. PARKING LOT (PINE VIEW) - EARLY EVENING                     50 \nBethlehem relaxes with his officers as wagons are loaded.

He looks over as Bethlehem's men nod in agreement. Michael sees that they're talking about Abby. \nBETHLEHEM Tell the Sheriff I want to be introduced. She does not belong in a mudhole like this. \nOne of the men hurries off. It's concern for Abby, not for his manhood that makes him step forward. \nMICHAEL Excuse me. \nBETHLEHEM (looks over) You again? \nMICHAEL That's my wife, General.   She's a married woman. \nBETHLEHEM Do you know what system of government we have here, son? (as Michael shrugs) A feudal system. Like the Middle Ages. With lords and vassals. That's you and me. Those lords, they had some ideas. If a vassal got married, it was the lord's right, his right, to sleep with the bride on the wedding night. \nMICHAEL Me and Abby have been married for three years. \nBETHLEHEM Sorry, but I wasn't invited to the wedding. Now, you've already done me one favor, son. Don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record. \nABBY \nAnother woman has pointed out to her what's going on. She can't hear what's being said, but she watches, concerned. \n(CONTINUED) \n50   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 50 \nPARKING LOT \nBETHLEHEM We'll be civilized about this. I want you to give me your blessing. \nMICHAEL Sir, I can't.     You can't. \nBETHLEHEM Can't? I'm tired of can't. We had a great nation once. Do you know what made it that way? I can! Till the weak came along. The 'I can'ts' destroyed us. But I'm going to make us strong again. I'm going to be the father of a new nation. (draws his sword) Do you know why it will be me? \nMichael looks to Abby as she starts across the street. \nBETHLEHEM Because I can! \nThe SWORD WHISTLES down.       Accompanied by an anguished cry: \nABBY Michael! \nAbby rushes forward, but she's blocked by Getty and another man. She cries out again and again. \nFilled with impotent fury, Briscoe squeezes out the words. \nBRISCOE You didn't have to -- \nBETHLEHEM Didn't have to what, Sheriff? \nThree Holnist soldiers draw down on Briscoe.      Bethlehem circles, menacing on his horse. \nBETHLEHEM Your people seem seditious.    You seem seditious. \nBriscoe stares down at Michael's crumpled form.      Abby wails. \n(CONTINUED) \n50   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            50 \nBRISCOE Aw, Michael... \nBriscoe might go after Bethlehem despite the odds. \nBETHLEHEM What am I seeing here? I'm waiting. \nBRISCOE (burying his anger) Man came through here. With mail. Said he was a postman. Said the government had been restored back east. \nBETHLEHEM What government? \nFrom out of the crowd -- a voice.         Ford. \nFORD The United States government. \nBethlehem whirls his horse at the noise. \nBETHLEHEM Who said that? \nNot waiting for an answer, Getty charges the crowd, knocks one of the onlookers down. A dead silence. \nBethlehem frowns, thinks it over a minute. \nBETHLEHEM Which way did he go? (a beat) Do not make me ask again. \nBRISCOE (lies) East. \nBETHLEHEM (to Getty) Send a patrol east. Send three more south, north and west. (to Briscoe) They'd better find him east. \n51   EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                      51 \n", "test3_id": 2408}

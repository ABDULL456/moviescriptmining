{"train": "THE POSTMAN \nscreenplay by \nBrian Helgeland and Eric Roth \nbased on the novel by \nDavid Brin \nNovember 4, 1996 \nEarly Production Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE (UTAH) - DAY                            1 \nJagged mountains defy a dark, foreboding sky. We hear PLODDING HOOVES, CREAKING LEATHER. A lone wanderer appears. Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he carries a bolt-action carbine. His name forgotten, history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN. \nHis laden pack mule, BILL, BRAYS, as they pass a battered sign: \"The Great Salt Lake Marina.\" They start down a slope and begin to cross a... \nDRY LAKE BED \nA bizarre, wind-swept sight. Dozens of boats resting lee- to on the dry, cracked earth. It's like God pulled the plug. Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two. \nWOMAN (V.O.) The last of the great cities died when my father was a child. Another victim of yet another war. The plagues followed. And the terrors. The living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained. The Earth itself had fallen prey to chaos. For three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase. The ocean was barren. Poisoned. Near death. \nAs The Postman continues to cross, the CAMERA PULLS BACK. He's soon lost in the massive vista. \nWOMAN (V.O.) Sixteen long years passed before the great lungs started working again. My father said it was as if the ocean breathed a great sigh of relief... \nA RUMBLE of THUNDER. RAIN begins to fall. The earth just sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. Rivulets run. Puddles form. We begin to get the feeling that soon these boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                   1 \nTRACK a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the sand. And then, running to fill another in a series of depressions. They make a pattern we recognize as -- \nMAN'S FOOTPRINTS \nThese tracks may already be days old as they fill with rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS. A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low, disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner plans -- for now. \n2   EXT. HIGHWAY ON-RAMP (UTAH) - DAY                            2 \nA bullet-ridden sign reads: \"U.S. 84 North.\" The Postman leads Bill down a barren 4-lane. Weeds poke up through the asphalt. The rusting hulk of a car rests in the median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. The Postman plucks a flower. He sticks it into a buttonhole and continues. \nBILL BRAYS woefully.    In answer: \nTHE POSTMAN I don't know. And if you ask me again, I'm going to slug you. \nThey near a sign: \"Thank You For Visiting Utah.\" The Postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it. \nTHE POSTMAN It's been fun, hasn't it, kids? (to the sign) You're welcome! \n3   EXT. 4-LANE (IDAHO) - BILLBOARD - DAY                        3 \nBill tugs up weeds as The Postman is climbing up a ladder on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon. \nAbove, The Postman sands atop a billboard catwalk. He references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon through binoculars with one broken lens. He pauses at a Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line. \n4   EXT. HIGHWAY TRAVEL STOP (IDAHO) - DAY                        4 \nA 76 Station and the remains of a Howard Johnson's. Alert, carbine in hand, The Postman leads in the mule. Rusting cars sag on flattened tires. There's a stripped fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo foundation which bristles with burned timbers. \nBill stops to drink out of a stream.   The Postman swats at him with his hat. \nTHE POSTMAN Damnit, Bill, you know I need to check it first! \nBill hangs his head. The Postman digs through his pack. He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several small bottles -- with stream water. He adds a few drops from each bottle. Swirls it around. Then dips a tiny strip of paper into the water. The paper turns a vivid purple. The Postman is dubious. \nTHE POSTMAN Better than turpentine. (touches some to his lips) Tastes about the same. Your call, Bill. \nBill drinks. \nTHE POSTMAN You ain't picky, Bill. I like that about you. \nThe Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and crosses to the 76 Station. An old extension ladder on the ground. The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over. Beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the 20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color before. \nThe Postman tries the station door. Locked. Smiling ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window. \n5   INT. 76 STATION - OFFICE - DAY                                5 \nA shambles. The Postman kicks around the table. He finds a few beat-up CDs, flips through them. Reads the label. \n(CONTINUED) \n5   CONTINUED:                                                      5 \nTHE POSTMAN 'Running on Empty'? Tell me about it. \nTossing it, he turns, stops. There, resting on a pile of trash is a bashed-in portable TV. The Postman smiles. \nTHE POSTMAN Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147 channels. Everything from Jesus to 'Jeopardy'. \nHe steps over, switches on the set.      Nothing happens, but The Postman pretends just the same.      He mimics static, then: \nTHE POSTMAN 'Like sands through the hour- glass, so are the days of our lives...' (switching channels) 'Michael Shields, come on down, you're the next contestant on...'The Price is Right'.' (switching again) I'll take Domestic Nuclear Disasters for two hundred thousand, Alex... \nThe Postman stops suddenly.    Click. \nTHE POSTMAN We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the Second Civil War... Well, shit. \nThe Postman stares at the blank screen a moment. There's a sudden, panicked RUSTLING from behind the service manager's desk. The Postman wheels around, raises the carbine. \nTHE POSTMAN I don't want any trouble... I bet you don't either... Let's just call it a draw, okay? \n76 BALL \nThe Postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the last two rusted bolts. As it starts to give... \nTHE POSTMAN It's going to take a second.    I got my stuff bolted in. \nBANDITS \nThe Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back. \nLEAD BANDIT Put some buckshot through it, Martin. Just to hurry him up. \nHULKING BANDIT I only got three shells left. \nLEAD BANDIT So use his gun. \nThe Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims. CLICK. It isn't loaded. The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside, pulls a knife from his boot. Grimly, he begins to climb. \n76 BALL \nCramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball, trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. It won't budge. \nLADDER \nThe Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go. \n76 BALL \nNo good.   Time's up.   The Postman starts rocking the pole. \nLADDER \nThe Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the rocking motion. Hangs on. \n(CONTINUED) \n8   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            8 \n76 BALL \nKnife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside. At that instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time. The rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in place. It pops. The ball is frozen for an instant before going with the pole's tilt. \nLADDER \nThe 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. The other Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past. \nTHE POSTMAN \nwhips head over heels as the ball speeds away. \nFIELD \nThe 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts apart. Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his feet. \nTHE POSTMAN Bill! \nBill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman. \nLosing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head. Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. The Bandits charge, quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first. \nHolding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over Bill's back. As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit aims the rifle. He's got The Postman in his sights. \nHe's about to fire when -- Bandit #20 stands up INTO the SHOT. He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and he's laughing like a hyena! \nBANDIT #20 We're rich! \n9    EXT. OVERLOOK HILL (IDAHO) - DAY                             9 \nThe Postman sits on a rock, holding Bill's halter so the mule must face him. They are in the midst of an argument. \nTHE POSTMAN It's true, we haven't done this in a while, but it's like riding a bicycle. Now, open your mouth. \nThe Postman pries his mouth open. Taking a toothbrush, he tends to Bill's teeth, then gives him an appraising look. BILL BRAYS. \nTHE POSTMAN I know the rule. It's my rule! Avoid civilization at all costs. But we gotta eat, don't we? (as BILL BRAYS again) What are you so worried about, Bill? All you gotta do is stand there. I'm the one with all the lines. \nThe Postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town far below. Making his case all the while -- even as BILL BRAYS in protest. \n10   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE (IDAHO) - DAY                            10 \nA patch of mud. In the center of the square fifty townspeople stand before a plank stage where The Postman wraps up a performance of MacBeth. He plays it with a mis-remembered gusto the people enjoy. Children especially are enamored. A heavily-muscled man, WOODY, lingers on the fringe of the crowd -- watching The Postman with inscrutable intensity. \nTHE POSTMAN They said, 'Fear not, MacBeth, 'til Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane'! \nHe looks off stage for someone, but no one appears. \nTHE POSTMAN I said, Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane! \nBill trots on-stage. Covered with twigs, BILL is Birnam Wood. He BRAYS lustily. The audience laughs in delight. The children clap. Only Woody seems unaffected. \n(CONTINUED) \n10   CONTINUED:                                                     10 \nThe Postman grabs two wooden swords -- he knows it's going well. \nTHE POSTMAN Arm, arm yourselves! If the witch's words are true, there'll be no running or hiding here! \nShaking off the twigs, Bill takes one of the swords in his mouth. The two of them dash back and forth pretending to fight off an imaginary attack. Finally, The Postman looks out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can. \nTHE POSTMAN Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that. Out brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. It's a tale told by a moron. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. (waves sword) But blow, wind! Come wrack! At least we'll die with the harness off our back! \nThe audience erupts in applause. But Woody stands still as stone. The Postman takes a bow. Even Bill does a cross-legged dip. Knowing when to quit, he steps off the stage to many hearty handshakes. \nWoody watches his every move. MRS. THOMPSON, one of the town's leaders, steps up. She's accompanied by crotchety old CURMUDGEON LARRY. \nMRS. THOMPSON The children have never heard Shakespeare before. \nTHE POSTMAN (grinning) They still haven't. \nBETHLEHEM I want pure blood. Someone like... \nBethlehem notes the Boy, turns to see the object of his attention, and spots The Postman leaving out the front gate. \nBETHLEHEM That man. \nIdaho and another soldier are on it. The Postman tries to back away as the two dismount and come toward him. \nTHE POSTMAN You don't understand... \nBut Idaho and the soldier aren't programmed for explanations -- they grab him. \nIDAHO You were required to show yourself. \nTHE POSTMAN But, I'm not with these people. I'm just passing through. I -- \nIdaho silences him with a rifle butt to the head. Everything falls OUT OF FOCUS \nIDAHO (O.S.) Take the mule. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n11   EXT. HOLNIST TRAINING CAMP (WESTERN IDAHO) - DAY             11 \nSpread out in the valley is General Bethlehem's Holnist Expeditionary Force. A five hundred-man army enjoying all the comforts a bivouac can offer. \n19 head-shaved CONSCRIPTS, including Woody and The Postman, are held in a cramped, barbed wired pen. They watch as three more are shoved inside. One of them is Bandit #20. He and The Postman come face to face, recognize each other. \nBANDIT #20 Hi. \nTHE POSTMAN (astonished) Hi? \nThe Postman steps toward him, Bandit #20 backs off quickly. \nBANDIT #20 Well... I mean, we know each other, kind of... \nTHE POSTMAN Kind of. \nBANDIT #20 (looking around) Wow! \nTHE POSTMAN So what did you guys do with my cigarettes? \nBANDIT #20 We traded them for a woman. \nTHE POSTMAN Wonderful.   What happened to your partners? \nBANDIT #20 They traded me to the Holnists. \nGUARD (O.S.) Ten hut! \nGeneral Bethlehem approaches on horseback. Colonel Getty follows behind. Bethlehem looks his new recruits over. Dismounting, he enters the pen and walks among them. \n(CONTINUED) \n11   CONTINUED:                                                      11 \nBETHLEHEM Welcome, gentlemen, to your new life. You have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of Holn. The strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak. Men, strong men, have been denied their destiny. You men have been saved from that fate. Redemption is within your grasp. \nHe starts down the line, looking the men over. He stops in front of a GANGLY RECRUIT. The Postman is alongside. \nBETHLEHEM You. What did you do before you were given this opportunity? \nGANGLY RECRUIT I had a shovel. I digged holes. \nBethlehem regards him benevolently. \nBETHLEHEM You digged holes... Well, now you're going to fill them. (turns to Postman) And you? \nTHE POSTMAN Me? \nBETHLEHEM Is there any question in anyone's mind that I was talking to you? Yes, you. You look like a dangerous man. Are you? \nTHE POSTMAN I'm just a performer. Shakespeare. Stuff like that. \nBETHLEHEM Shakespeare? \nTHE POSTMAN He was a writer. He -- \nBETHLEHEM I know who Shakespeare was... 'Cry \"Havoc!\" and let slip the dogs of war.' \n(CONTINUED) \n11   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               11 \nBethlehem says the lines boldly, encourages his men to clap for him. He looks at The Postman expectantly. Finally... \nTHE POSTMAN I, um, you want a line? \nBethlehem nods.     The Postman thinks a moment... \nTHE POSTMAN 'To be or not to be: That is the question.' \nBethlehem looks at his men as if to say, \"Is this all this guy's got?\" Bethlehem eyes The Postman; he wants a contest. \nBETHLEHEM 'We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.' \nThe Holnists clap, they know their General can best this guy. \nTHE POSTMAN (gaining confidence) 'Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York.' \nBethlehem claps The Postman on the back. \nBETHLEHEM You're pretty good. You're also a fighter. I see it in your eyes. \nThe Postman doesn't answer. Hesitant, he doesn't want to get into any more trouble than he's already in. \nBETHLEHEM Don't you agree? Come on, a man's got to speak his mind. \nBethlehem sounds sincere.    He seems like a good guy. \nAt the mention of this name, the RECRUITS shout as one. \nRECRUITS God rest his soul! \nTHE POSTMAN (low) May he burn in hell. \nGetty looks over at him. He heard him. The Postman swallows hard. Getty stares hard. Then he turns away. He's not going to bust him on it. \nBETHLEHEM These are the laws that we live by. The eight is our symbol. Each man will bear it with pride. \nBethlehem nods at Idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to reveal the branded 8. \nBETHLEHEM Only then will you be part of the clan. Sit down, gentlemen. \nThe men move to sit in one of the three rows. Only then does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17 chairs. One SLOW RECRUIT is left standing. It doesn't take him long to realize that he's in trouble. \nBETHLEHEM Law One. You will obey orders without question. (to Slow Recruit) I told you to sit. \nSLOW RECRUIT (scared) There weren't enough chairs. \n(CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED:                                                        14 \nBETHLEHEM I didn't specify chairs. You could've sat down on the ground. \nThe Slow Recruit moves to do so. \nBETHLEHEM You disobeyed a direct order.    You broke Law One. \nIdaho and another soldier step up beside the Slow Recruit. \nBETHLEHEM Law Two.   Punishment shall be swift. \nThey hustle the Recruit to the tree. Idaho unslings a coil of rope, throws it over a tree limb. They quickly slip a loop over the Slow Recruit's ankles and haul him upside down into the air. \nBETHLEHEM Law Three: Mercy is for the weak. Four: Terror will defeat reason. Five: Your allegiance is to the clan. Six: Justice can be dictated. Law Seven. Any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan. Does any man here wish to challenge me? \nThere are no takers. \nBETHLEHEM On your feet! \nThe conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open. \nWithout a word, without a look -- Bethlehem reaches out and draws a sword from a sheath that Getty holds. Bethlehem steps to the Slow Recruit -- who slowly twists around. \nBETHLEHEM Law Eight: There is only one penalty: Death. \nBethlehem raises the sword. \nSLOW RECRUIT Please, I'm begging you. \n(CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 14 \nTHE POSTMAN \nAs the sword finds its mark.     Bethlehem looks at him, but addresses all. \nBETHLEHEM You will get out of this army what you put into it. Work and you'll be fed. Fight and you'll be respected. Die and you'll be remembered. It's up to you. \nBethlehem turns and walks away.     Getty following behind. The Postman watches as they go.     Idaho steps up to him. \nIDAHO You thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan? \nTHE POSTMAN No, sir.   I'm a follower not a leader. \nIDAHO You see Colonel Getty? Always following the General? He's the only man who ever challenged. Fight lasted six seconds, but the General didn't kill him. He cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old Getty's been following him like a dog ever since. \nThe Postman looks back to see Bethlehem and Getty disappear into the gloom. Idaho grins, likes how this affects a new man. \nThe Postman moves on.     Idaho stops Woody as he passes. \nIDAHO The General don't see it, but I say you got some nigger in you. \nWoody clenches his jaw, but wisely doesn't answer. \n15   EXT. PLAINS - DAY                                                 15 \nRain as the army moves. Boots suck at the mud. War wagons heave out of ruts. A monster gun is mounted on an old John Deere semi, pulled by a team of ten horses. The conscripts fill the middle ranks, each bearing a heavy pack. \n(CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:                                                      15 \nMarching beside Woody, The Postman stares blankly ahead. The cry to halt. The conscripts unsling their packs, catch their breath. Idaho pulls The Postman out of line. \nIDAHO The General would like a word with you, Shakespeare. \n16   INT. GENERAL BETHLEHEM'S TENT - DAY                             16 \nBethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in hand. He's got a mirror set up so he can see his reflection. He's doing a self-portrait in the tradition of the great Dutch Masters -- but it's a dismal failure. \nHe continues painting even as Idaho leads The Postman in. Idaho salutes, steps back. For a moment, The Postman doesn't quite know what to do. \nBETHLEHEM (re: the book and binoculars on the table) They're yours. A solitary man, aren't you? Binoculars. To watch life from a distance. And Shakespeare. To read about it instead of living it. \nBethlehem wants an answer.    The Postman clears his throat. \nTHE POSTMAN No offense, General, but you seem to have read some Shakespeare yourself. \nBETHLEHEM If he wishes to rise above mere thuggery, a military commandeer must be classically educated. Philosophy, history. Even a sense of the dramatic. (a beat) Do you know what I did before the war? Do you think I was in the army? I sold copying machines. I was a salesman. The talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me. \n(CONTINUED) \n16   CONTINUED:                                                     16 \nHe picks up Finding A Way to Win by Nathan Holn.     A 20- year-old self-help book. \nBandit #20 can't contain his giggling, so Idaho backhands the sound out of him -- then looks back to The Postman. \nGrim The Postman starts forward, looks from the rotten bridge to the water and back again as he moves. \nAll eyes on him as he starts across... \n20   EXT. BRIDGE - DAY                                              20 \nThe Postman steps lightly. Far below, the river rages. A knotty plank starts to crack underfoot. Scooting off it, he takes a last look around. Continues across to... \n21   EXT. WEST RIDGE - DAY                                          21 \nThe soldiers greet him -- unholy smiles on their ugly mugs. They point him ahead, prod him forward toward a trail of wet blood which leads deeper into the thicket. \nStooping, The Postman enters. The soldiers split off and track along with him on either side of the thicket. \n22   EXT. THICKET - DAY                                              22 \nThorns catch and tear at his clothes as The Postman pushes his way through. He freezes. Ahead, sprawled and twisted, the mauled, bloody corpse of a Holnist soldier. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) Why are you stopping? \nTHE POSTMAN I found him. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) He alive? \nClearly he is not. \nTHE POSTMAN Yeah. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) Bring him out. \nThe Postman heaves the corpse onto his back. Rising, steadying himself, he looks back over his shoulders at a GUTTURAL GROWL. He hurries forward. \nARMY \nEveryone stares across the river, straining to see as The Postman emerges with the corpse on his back. \nON BRIDGE \nThe Postman starts across, hampered by his burden.   He pauses, at his feet, the cracked, knotty plank. \nIDAHO (across river) Hurry up! You still got a lion to bag! \nThe Postman decides, deliberately steps on the PLANK. CRACK. The Postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down, disappear in the river below. \nThe corpse surfaces first, floats in the water. \nThen The Postman. Farther down the river. Swimming downstream with powerful strokes. Between his efforts and the current, he's being quickly swept away from the Holnists. \nAs Bethlehem's eyes narrow in fury. \n(CONTINUED) \n22   CONTINUED:                                                     22 \nA RIFLE BARKS a SHELL BACK after The Postman, but he disappears around a bend in the river. \nBethlehem signals to two soldiers. They start running along the east ridge toward the riverbend. \nTwo more start across the bridge to the west -- moving with military precision. \nBethlehem wheels toward the conscripts, points out Woody. \nBETHLEHEM In the water. Come back without him and you and another man will die in his place. \nWoody dives in the water. Bethlehem looks to Idaho who dives in as well. Conscripts buzz with nervous excitement. \nCONSCRIPTS Go!   Go! \nBANDIT #20 (caught up) I'll get him, sir. \nHe takes off running across the bridge. \n23   EXT. RIVER - DAY                                               23 \nA fallen tree spans the river. As The Postman is swept beneath, he reaches up and catches hold. Pulling himself out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore. He disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear. \nThey catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see footprints in the mud where The Postman pulled himself out. They start after him. \n24   EXT. CLEARING - WOODS - DAY                                    24 \nClothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, The Postman stops. He takes cover as the two soldiers run past. \nBreathing hard, The Postman steps out, starts across the clearing. He's halfway when Bandit #20 steps out from the trees. They look at each other for a moment. \nTHE POSTMAN Just let me go. I don't want to be part of your army. \n(CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED:                                                    24 \nBandit #20 hesitates for a moment, then breaks into a grin. \nBANDIT #20 My army.   I like the sound of that. \nThe Postman gestures with his knife. \nTHE POSTMAN Don't -- \nBANDIT #20 I got him!   Over -- \nThe Postman lunges, digs into Bandit #20's gut.   He blinks in surprise, then sags to the ground. \nThe Postman takes a step back. A shadow falls over him. It's Woody. Staring down at The Postman. They can hear others approaching from the river. \nWOODY They sent me to kill you. \nTHE POSTMAN Come with me. \nHis hair growing back nicely, The Postman has reached the proverbial fork in the road. He considers his two options: \"Pine View -- 32 miles.\" Or \"Ridgemont -- 220 miles.\" He looks the two roads over, thinks. \nTHE POSTMAN Well, that's easy. \n29   EXT. GATES (PINE VIEW, OREGON) - DUSK                           29 \nThe town is protected by a tall, long palisade.     Like Ft. Apache. All is dark as The Postman approaches. \nTHE POSTMAN Greetings, Pine View, Oregon! \nTWO SENTRIES appears from the gate house.    They aim arrows. \nSENTRY #1 Just head back the way you came. Pine View ain't buying, ain't listening and don't give charity. \nA moment of truth is here.    Finally, with authority: \nTHE POSTMAN Civilian, I'm on official business. I demand entry into the town of Pine View. \nSENTRY #2 What the hell are you talking about? \nTHE POSTMAN I'm through talking to you, buddy boy! Now get somebody with authority to open this gate! \nMore silhouettes appear on the palisade.     One is SHERIFF BRISCOE, a big, no-nonsense man. \nBRISCOE I'm Sheriff Briscoe. Who the hell are you? \nTHE POSTMAN I'm a representative of the United States Government -- \nAn uproar.    He makes himself heard above it. \n(CONTINUED) \n29   CONTINUED:                                                      29 \nTHE POSTMAN Authorized by order 417 of the restored Congress to reestablish a communication route to Idaho and lower Oregon. Now open that damn gate! \nBRISCOE What does that mean in English? \nTHE POSTMAN I'm your postman! \nThere's a silent hush. \nBRISCOE (to someone on wall) Hand me your gun. \nTHE POSTMAN Understand that tampering with or obstructing the mail is a federal offense. Furthermore, the Bolin Act requires you to provide all mail carriers with sanctuary and nourishment. (starting forward) Now open that damn gate! \nBRISCOE You got three seconds to get your ass outta here. \nTHE POSTMAN Is Jerry the contractor here? \nBriscoe pumps his shotgun, aims it at The Postman. \nTHE POSTMAN Wait! I'm going to get something out of my bag. \nThe Postman dumps the pack over, frantically shuffles through the letters. \nBRISCOE One! \nTHE POSTMAN Paul Davis!   124 Vernon Street! \nBRISCOE Never heard of him. Two! \n(CONTINUED) \n29   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                29 \nTHE POSTMAN Lois Kent!   14 Weymoth Lane! \nBRISCOE Three! \nHe fumbles for the last letter.       Briscoe takes aim. \nTHE POSTMAN Irene March!   478 River Road! \nThere's an absolute stunned silence.      Like a switch was thrown. \n30   EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY                                          30 \nThe crowd parts as everyone turns to look back at IRENE MARCH. Mrs. March, in her late 50s, is blind, her eyes clouded by cataracts. In disbelief... \nMRS. MARCH Did he say my name? \nThe sense of hope is palpable as the gates are swung back. Two TOWNIES hurry Mrs. March out to meet The Postman. They're followed by a throng. As he sees she's blind... \nTHE POSTMAN Oh, no... \nToo late now. They stop Mrs. March in front of him.        She stares off just to his left, a little afraid. \nMRS. MARCH I'm Irene March. \nTHE POSTMAN (uncomfortable) I have a letter for you. \nHe presses it into her hands, but she won't take it. \nMRS. MARCH Would you read it? \nTHE POSTMAN I'm sure it's personal. \nMRS. MARCH Please.   Someone has to. \n(CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                                         30 \nThe Postman has little choice.     As he opens the envelope... \nTHE POSTMAN We're delivering the old stock piles, but I'll accept all new correspondence as well. \nTOWNIE Just read it, will ya? \nTHE POSTMAN You'd meet a lot of people who don't believe in you. \nFORD I'll set them straight. \nTHE POSTMAN It's a lonely job. \nFORD I've been lonely all my life. \nThis response strikes a chord. The Postman sees how badly Ford wants something to hold onto. He sees himself. \nTHE POSTMAN So have I, Ford. So have I. \nThe Postman looks up at the creed on the wall.    Finally... \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                38 \nTHE POSTMAN What the hell?     Repeat after me. \nPOSTMAN/FORD (repeating) Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds. \nTHE POSTMAN Okay then. \nFORD (repeating) Okay, then. \nTHE POSTMAN No, no, no, I'm saying that. You just listen... By my authority you are now empowered to carry the mail. (extends a hand) Congratulations, you're a postman. \nThey shake hands. The Postman doesn't realize, but this is the most important moment in Ford's life. \nFORD I want you to know I'd die to get a letter through. \nFord's intensity takes The Postman back.       But the moment is broken when... \nBRISCOE (O.S.) Johnny, why don't you run along. I need to speak to this man. \nFord bristles at \"Johnny,\" looks to The Postman. \nFORD I'll see you around. \nTHE POSTMAN Sure thing, Ford. \nFord exits. \nBRISCOE Johnny's real impressed with you. Whole town's real impressed with you. \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              38 \nTHE POSTMAN I take it you're not. \nBRISCOE Smarter than you look. \nTHE POSTMAN What can I do for you, Sheriff? \nBRISCOE You can clear out. Or I can throw you out. Either way suits me fine. \nTHE POSTMAN I'm afraid you don't understand, Sheriff. I'm a government employee. Authorized by -- \nBRISCOE You're not authorized by shit. You're nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail. And I want you out of my town. \nTHE POSTMAN This is going in my report. \nBRISCOE These people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman. They need something real. They need help with the goddamn Holnists. Are you going to bring them that? (as The Postman doesn't answer) Didn't think so. All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts. I aim to keep it that way. You can stay till morning. Then I don't ever want to see you again. \nBriscoe exits, leaves The Postman alone in the post office. \n39   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                          39 \nThe Postman arrives home. He pushes open the door, knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved under the door. He gathers them up, flips through them. They're written on scraps, the backs of pictures, on handkerchiefs and homemade paper. They aren't old. \n(CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                                       39 \nThey're brand new.      Shaking his head, he closes the door. \nThe Postman has no sooner done so when there's a KNOCK on the window. He looks over at a woman. She shrugs, smiles, holds up a letter. The Postman sighs; he's trapped in here. \n40   EXT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - NIGHT                                     40 \nCAMERA STARTS ON a man with a string-tied package crossing the streets and DRIFTS TO the abandoned car where Ford lives. He's home. \nON FORD \nConcentrating, Ford holds a needle and thread and a piece of cloth on which he's drawn an approximation of the post office shoulder patch. By moonlight he embroiders it in. Not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either. \n41   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - CLOSE ON STRING-TIED             41 PACKAGE - NIGHT \n~from the previous scene.       It's on the table with a growing stack of mail. \nThe Postman is in bed, trying to sleep. But it's hard- coming. He laces his fingers behind his head, stares up at the moon through a hole in the wall. A KNOCK at the door. \nTHE POSTMAN Just leave it. \nThere's a pause.    And then, ANOTHER KNOCK. \nTHE POSTMAN I said leave it. \nThe door opens. Surprise. Abby stands in the doorway, her hair held up by an old red ribbon. He sits up. \nTHE POSTMAN Hello, Abby. \nABBY You'll be leaving tomorrow? \nTHE POSTMAN I guess. \n(CONTINUED) \nBRISCOE She and Michael are working the north meadow this morning. \nBriscoe reins up -- he's gone as far as his duty commands. \nBRISCOE Well, you're on your own. \nThe Postman tips his cap and continues riding by \"Pine View - Population 132.\" Briscoe watches a moment, then calls after him: \nBRISCOE Hey! Are you really who you say you are? \nTHE POSTMAN If I come back with some mail, you'll know! \nThe Postman continues. Caught in an inner turmoil, Briscoe reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a letter. He turns it over in his hands, looks off at The Postman. \nBRISCOE God damn it! \nBriscoe urges his horse forward, catches up. He hands The Postman the letter, then rides back for town. The Postman watches Briscoe. The people lining the wall. And he realizes just what effect he's had. There's nothing to do, but shrug his shoulders and ride. Strains of \"AMERICA\" still ECHO hauntingly OVER: \n45   EXT. ON ROAD - SUN                                           45 \nA green and lavender sunset. In the middle of nowhere, The Postman rides, chewing a piece of jerked beef. He flips through some of the letters entrusted to him. \n(CONTINUED) \n45   CONTINUED:                                                     45 \nTHE POSTMAN Eugene.     Benning. Portland. (stops short) Boston! (resumes) Seattle. Boise... St. Rose, Paradise on the Pacific... \nHe considers the letter, looks around as if someone may be watching. He just begins to tear the corner, then stops. \nTHE POSTMAN Maybe one thing can still be sacred. (to horse) All in all, not a bad gig, huh? \nThe HORSE SNORTS. Smiling, The Postman shoves the envelope into his bag. As he does, he finds something else. The red ribbon. He runs it through his fingers, thinks wistfully of Abby. Then, like a knight of old representing a lady's honor, he ties it to his mailbag and rides on. \n46   EXT. WELL (PINE VIEW) - DAY                                    46 \nAbby's washing clothes with a tub and washboard. Waging war on dirt. Michael leans against a tree, watches Abby at work until she notices him. She wipes the sweat from her brow, tries not to smile. \nABBY What are you looking at? \nMICHAEL Everything. \nHe steps over and they're in each other's arms. This is love. But as Michael kisses her, we hear a familiar alarm: \nSENTRY Holnists!    Holnists are coming! \n47   EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - DAY                          47 \nLed by Bethlehem and Getty, the soldiers ride in. Something about the citizens disturbs Bethlehem. \nBETHLEHEM They don't usually look at me. \n(CONTINUED) \n47   CONTINUED:                                                       47 \nBethlehem reins in across from the post office.     Someone has hung a tattered old American flag. \nBETHLEHEM Who's responsible for that?! \nNo one answers.     All heads are down now. \n48   INT. POST OFFICE - DAY                                           48 \nFord is sweeping up. The place looks almost presentable. He stops when he hears Bethlehem calling once more for the responsible party. \nFord starts forward.    Suddenly Briscoe is blocking his way. \nBRISCOE Holnists, Johnny. You gotta stay out of sight. \nFORD I'm a postman. And I'm not hiding from anyone. I -- \nBriscoe grabs him by the shirt, hauls him out the back way. \nBRISCOE You stay out of this, or I'll lock you up myself damnit. \n49   EXT. PINE VIEW - DAY                                             49 \nBethlehem picks Michael out of the crowd. \nBETHLEHEM You.  You'll be responsible. (to soldiers) Get him a torch. \nMichael walks out into the square. One of the soldiers returns with a burning torch, gives it to Michael. \nBethlehem looks at the town, then at Michael. \nBETHLEHEM Set that flag on fire. \n(CONTINUED) \n49   CONTINUED:                                                       49 \nON MICHAEL \nIt's killing him, but Michael sets the torch to the flag. BETHLEHEM Now throw it through the window of your 'post office.' \nCRASH!    The TORCH goes through the post office WINDOW. \nON FORD \nStruggling to get out, but Briscoe blocks his way. \nON BETHLEHEM \nAs flames grow, he takes one last look around. \nBETHLEHEM The United States doesn't exist. That flag is an abomination. \nBriscoe steps forward, attempts to diffuse the situation. \nThe Holnist army rides out. Overcome by grief, tied at the wrists, Abby stumbles behind one of the wagons. \n52   EXT. BURNT-OUT POST OFFICE - NIGHT                            52 \nBefore the smoking ruins, Ford pulls on a blue shirt, his homemade postal flag on the shoulder. As Briscoe steps up, Ford shows him a bundle of singed, but intact letters. \nFORD I managed to save these. \nBRISCOE (re: shirt) Take that thing off, Johnny.    You want to die, too? \nFord shoves the letters in a makeshift bag, then climbs onto his waiting pony. \nFORD I'm headed south. With the mail. \nBRISCOE (grabs harness) Don't be a damn fool. \nFORD What kind should I be?... Haw! \nFord digs his heels into the pony and is off in a flash doing damn near a buck seventy-five. \n53   INT. MOVIE THEATER (BENNING, OREGON) - DAY                    53 \nMail call. The Postman stands in front of the torn screen. Hoping for glory by association, the smiling Mayor stands beside him. The ragged people of Benning clamor in front. Kids smile up at him as he calls out names: \nTHE POSTMAN Rachel Clark! (as she's there) Charlie Sykes! (as he's there) Graham Druitt! \nVOICE G.D. died last winter of flu. \nThe Postman nods, sticks the letter back in his bag. \nTHE POSTMAN That's it for now, folks. There'll be more once a real system is in place. \n(CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED:                                                      53 \nAs usual, The Postman is assaulted with questions. \nMAN Tell us about President Starkey! \nWOMAN What about New York City?   Did they survive the plague? \nTHE POSTMAN Survive? They got Broadway up and running again. There's a kid doing Andrew Lloyd Webber like you wouldn't believe. \nAn older woman sheds a happy tear -- this is wonderful news. \nMAN #3 How much is it to mail a letter? \nTHE POSTMAN (smiles) A buck seventy-five. \nMAN #3 That sounds awful cheap. \nTHE POSTMAN The catch is the only currency recognized are silver American coins minted before 1964 and two dollar bills. Look for Thomas Jefferson. Of course, food is always acceptable as barter. \nThe moment is split by a SIREN. \n54   EXT. BENNING, OREGON - DAY                                      54 \nA long double-line of Holnist Cavalry stand in formation in front of the city walls made from stacks of crushed cars. On top, a SKINNY SENTRY CRANKS the SIREN while a CHUBBY SENTRY watches. \nBethlehem rides through them with Abby in tow -- her wrists tied by a rope which is looped around the pommel of Bethlehem's saddle. Her face is bruised, her bottom lip split. Bethlehem reins up, puzzled by the apparent stall. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED:                                                  54 \nGIBBS (rides up; salutes) They won't open the gates, sir. \nBETHLEHEM What? \nGIBBS They say they got a representative of the restored United States in there. They say this army is illegal. They say -- \nThe Chubby Sentry answers from the top of the palisade. \nCHUBBY SENTRY Drop dead and go to hell! \nThe Chubby Sentry disappears back behind cover. Bethlehem remains controlled, but his manner becomes deadly. \nBETHLEHEM The Romans had an expression they used to scare their children. 'Hannibal ad portas!' -- Hannibal is at the gates. Do you know who Hannibal was? (as she doesn't answer) Of course not. A pretty girl like you wouldn't know a thing. (to Getty) Colonel Getty, get some men up there and open that gate. \n55   EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY                                     55 \nThe Mayor hurries over, The Postman following reluctantly behind. The Mayor spots the Sentries up on the parapet. \nMAYOR What the hell are you doing?! Open the gates! \nSKINNY SENTRY Government's restored! We don't have to take their crap anymore! \n56   EXT. PALISADE GATES (BENNING) - DAY                         56 \nTwo Holnists scale the gates. They're near the top when the Skinny Sentry appears. He FIRES an ARROW. Hit through the shoulder, one Holnist falls. The other jumps. \n57   EXT. PARAPET - INSIDE WALLS - DAY                               57 \nChubby and Skinny duck down behind the safety of the walls, trading high-fives. \n58   EXT. PALISADE GATES (BENNING) - DAY                             58 \nBethlehem orders his men to pull back. He shakes his head, a quiet rage building. But he knows there's no military threat here. It's going to be a massacre. \n59   EXT. PARAPET - INSIDE WALLS - DAY                               59 \nClimbing an inside ladder, the Mayor slams the Chubby Sentry against the wall. \nMAYOR Idiots! \nCITIZEN #1 (realizing; scared) They're gonna kill us all. \nThe Mayor peers out through an observation hole.   The Postman and several others join him. \n64   CONTINUED:                                                         64 \nThe Holnist FIRES first. We don't see the hit. Just watch as The Postman FIRES an answering ROUND. The Holnist goes down. \nThe Postman reins up alongside the wagon. Grunting with pain, he reaches down, takes Abby's arm and swings her up behind him. Then digs his heels in for all he's worth. \nMore Holnists come on the run. They FIRE. The HORSE SNORTS in pain. He's hit. But The Postman urges him on, heading into the woods. \nBethlehem snaps off the arrow shaft and shouts: \nBETHLEHEM Colonel Getty! \n65   EXT. WOODLAND ROAD - DAY                                           65 \nAbby is concerned as the horse slows to a trot. \nABBY We can't stop now. They'll be coming after us. \nThe Postman's head lolls forward. She feels something on her hand, pulls it back smeared with blood. The Postman's shot in the belly. \nThe horse is failing.       Near death. \nWe hear the sound of PURSUING CAVALRY. Abby urges the horse off the road. When the thicket grows too dense, Abby jumps down. She catches The Postman as he slides off, easing him to the ground. \nTHE POSTMAN (disoriented) Abby... \nAbby shushes him. She pulls on the horse's bridle to force him farther along. But it's no good, the wounded horse goes down on its knees. \nAnd five RIDERS THUNDER past.       Fooled.   All but the SIXTH, who pulls up to listen. \nIn the deep b.g., flames lick at the billowing black smoke. The town is burning. \nThe HORSE WHINNIES: in its death throes.        Abby panics, tries to quiet the horse. \n(CONTINUED) \n65   CONTINUED:                                                    65 \nThe Sixth Soldier has heard the suffering horse. He draws his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the thicket. \nON ABBY AND POSTMAN \nThe Postman lies unconscious on the ground. Abby sits beside him, rifle in hand. The Sixth Soldier appears. \nABBY Don't move. \nHe hesitates at first. Then dismounts and moves toward her. Abby cocks the rifle. \nSIXTH SOLDIER If you'd had a bullet, you'd a used it by now. \nMoving closer still, he doesn't see the BRANCH pulled back in The Postman's hand until it SNAPS hard into his face. \nHe stumbles back. \nABBY You're right. \nAbby dashes out, rifle in hand. She swings for the bleachers. The butt catches the side of the Sixth Soldier's head. He falls hard. \nThe Postman's eyes flutter. Dazed, he watches as Abby pilfers through the Soldier's gear. She takes everything of value: a knife, bullets, a canteen. His eyes flutter closed. \n66   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                              66 \nSnowflakes swirl. Abby lays a sapling travois beside The Postman. He groans as she rolls him onto it, tucks a blanket around him. Using all the strength God gave her, Abby lifts one end, gets it high enough to hitch it to the Sixth Soldier's horse. As Abby leads the horse away... \n67   EXT. WOOD ROAD - DAY                                          67 \nThe snow has increased. A Holnist patrol moves down the road, disappears around a bend. A beat. \n(CONTINUED) \n67   CONTINUED:                                                       67 \nAbby appears, leading the horse and travois.   She crosses the road and disappears into the woods. \nA moment later, she reappears with a pine branch which she uses to brush at the snow, obscuring their tracks. \n68   EXT. CASCADE MOUNTAINS (OREGON) - DAY                            68 \nRiding into a blizzard, Abby leads the way up a zigzag path. A valley opens up below. The unconscious Postman lies bundled on the travois. \n69   EXT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                        69 \nA little square shape just visible beyond a creek.     Abby leads the horse and travois-bound Postman to it. \n70   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                        70 \nOne room. Dirt floor. The WINDOWS RATTLE in the WIND. Snow falls through a hole in the roof. The wooden DOOR BURSTS back and Abby enters. Half-frozen, she leads the horse and the travois right inside. \n71   INT. HUNTING SHACK - NIGHT                                       71 \nA fire has been lit. \nThe Postman lies unconscious, his shirt open as Abby washes around his wound. She pulls the shirt back to clean his chest. The material falls away and Abby stops short. There -- high on his biceps -- a branded \"8.\" She stares in disbelief. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n72   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                         72 \nThe Postman lies on a cot below the window.    He's conscious, but pale as a ghost. \nAbby brings him a bowl of soup. Very thin soup.       Stirring it with a spoon, The Postman smiles at Abby. \nTHE POSTMAN Thank you. \nShe turns her back on him without a word.   The Postman tries an exchange just the same. \n(CONTINUED) \n72   CONTINUED:                                                      72 \nAbby starts putting on layer after layer of clothing. \nABBY I'm going to check the pass. \nTHE POSTMAN Why are you in such a hurry to get out of here? I can think of worse places. And worse company to -- \nAnd with the SLAM of the DOOR she is gone. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n78   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                         78 \nA few flakes of snow have begun to drift down. The Postman sits at the window -- starts to play tic-tac-toe in the frost. But then it dawns on him: \nTHE POSTMAN You can't play tic-tac-toe with yourself. \n79   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                                 79 \nDisoriented, Abby stops to take stock of her surround- ings. But she can't make anything out -- the snowfall is too thick. \n80   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                         80 \nThe fire is dying. The food untouched. The Postman sits in bed staring anxiously out the window. The snow has turned into a blizzard. He runs Abby's red ribbon through his hands. \n81   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                             81 \nAbby trudges along heavily.

HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                     83 \nThe door opens and out steps The Postman. In pain, he staggers around the back of the cabin -- in search of her. \n84   EXT. STREAM - DAY                                            84 \nAbby looks up, sees him coming. The Postman collapses across from her. Both prone, they're also nearly nose-to- nose. \nTHE POSTMAN I can't help you. \nFinally, he pulls himself to his knees. She does the same. They climb each other to a standing position. Arm- in-arm, they start for the cabin. \n85   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                    85 \nAbby sits huddled in blankets. The fire is blazing. The Postman steps over, sets the once-again-hot bowl of stew before her. \nShe considers the food a moment. \nABBY I told you that's all there was. \nTHE POSTMAN That's why you should have it. \nABBY I knew you could walk. \nTHE POSTMAN You're weird, you know that? \n86   INT. HUNTING SHACK - NIGHT                                    86 \nThe Postman lies in bed, stares through the hole in the roof. A full moon is on the rise. Abby lies in her own makeshift bed, also awake. After a long silence: \nTHE POSTMAN We walked on the moon once, Abby. \nABBY So?    What good is that now? \nTHE POSTMAN Obviously you've forgotten Tang and microwave ovens. (a beat) Your face looks pretty. \nAbby looks up. \nTHE POSTMAN Not so bruised. \nABBY Look, there's something you'd better know. You're going to find out soon enough. I'm pregnant. (a long beat) It's Michael's baby. You're just the body father. \nTHE POSTMAN How do you know it's mine and not Bethlehem's? \nABBY He tried with me almost every night. He couldn't do it. So he beat me. Said it was my fault. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n87   EXT. HUNTING SHACK/PASS - DAY                                 87 \nAbby stands atop the low rise -- looking out to the pass. Spring has come to the mountains. At long last the snow is starting to recede. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n88   EXT. FISHING POOL - DAY                                       88 \nThe Postman kneels by the bank, sharpening a knife to clean the fish he's caught. \n(CONTINUED) \n88   CONTINUED:                                                          88 \nThen, he catches his reflection in the water.       Tangled beard. Matted hair. Is that him? \nHe suddenly starts sharpening the knife with renewed vigor. We get a sense he's not going to use it on the fish. \nHANDS \nplunge into the water, pull splashfuls up. We START ON The Postman's back, then ARC AROUND as he washes his face. He's just finished shaving off his beard with the hunting knife. He's nicked-up, but it's a definite improvement and he smiles in satisfaction -- until he sees -- \nAbby, reflected in the water. \nTHE POSTMAN Abby. \nThe Postman whips around to see her standing there. \nRealizing, Bethlehem turns the face from side-to-side. \nBETHLEHEM Who the hell are you? \nCARRIER (PRISONER) Carrier Twelve. United States, um, Postal Service. \nGetty sets some of the Carrier's anti-Holnist propaganda onto Bethlehem's field table. Bethlehem picks it up. \nIt's hard to say what he's thinking.      Finally: \nBETHLEHEM I want the camp struck at dawn. We're moving north. \nGIBBS Yes, sir. \nBethlehem looks back to Carrier Twelve. \nBETHLEHEM (chilling) You spelled tyranny wrong. \n100   EXT. RV CAMP - DAWN                                           100 \nTen letter carriers are on horseback. Among them, Red and Ponytail. Ford and The Postman are also on horses. Each rider salutes The Postman, then gets a sheaf of anti- Holnist propaganda from Ford. \nTHE POSTMAN I wish they'd stop saluting. \nIt's annoying him. As Chubby rides up. The Postman catches his right wrist as he attempts to salute. So Chubby salutes with the left hand instead. As they line up: \nTHE POSTMAN Just stay safe and remember. The mailman's more important than the mail. \nCHUBBY Boy, he's smart. \nThe sun just peeks up over the horizon. At that signal, the carriers thunder off, the ground trembling under them. The look on their faces. The glory of it all. They're alive! The Postman hesitates, watches after them a moment. \nTHE POSTMAN What the hell? \nUrging his horse forward, he rides after them. With them. And then, like an exploding firework, each postman shoots off in a separate direction. Headed for all points of the compass and some in between. \n101   EXT. OREGON HAMLET - DAY                                      101 \nThe Postman looks down on the gathered crowd from his horse and smiles. \nTHE POSTMAN For President Starkey and the First Congress of the Restored United States, I officially declare Postal Station 10... What's the name of this town? \nYOUNG LEADER We never named it. \nTHE POSTMAN (thinks; smiles) I officially declare Postal Station 10 in Elvis, Oregon, open for business! \n102   EXT. TOWN (SOMEWHERE IN OREGON) - DAY                         102 \nAn eye-blink of a town. Ponytail stands on a crate reading names and handing letters to the grateful people massed around her. \n103   EXT. TOWN (IDAHO BORDER) - DAY                                103 \nRed and Chubby finish mail call, exchange an amazed look as they're offered a platter of food. \n104   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                          104 \nThe moon hangs low over an interstate. A rider is silhouetted by the silvery orb, looking like some post- apocalyptic Don Quixote. It's The Postman. \n105   EXT. FARMHOUSE/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                             105 \nSeen FROM the porch, a rider gallops hard on the road beyond. \nA LITTLE BOY comes rushing out, letter in hand. The boy pulls up short; realizes the rider is already too far gone. The boy's shoulders sag; he's crushed. \nLITTLE BOY I missed him. \nIt's an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the distance and turns back around. A frozen beat and he starts galloping back down the road. \nFearless, the boy holds out the letter. The rider closes; it's The Postman. The boy stretches out as far as he can. Without breaking stride, The Postman leans out of the saddle, snatches the letter as he passes. \nThe boy watches after him -- knows what he's going to be when he grows up. \n106   EXT. PINE VIEW GATES - DAY                                    106 \nSheriff Briscoe huffs and puffs his big frame up the ladder and onto the top of the palisade. \nBRISCOE Phil, this better not be another of your U.F.O.'s. \nHe looks where the sentry points. The Postman waits at the gate, behind him on horseback: Ford and Abby. \n(CONTINUED) \n106   CONTINUED:                                                      106 \nTHE POSTMAN I'm back!   And I got mail. \nBRISCOE (amazed) I'll be damned. \n107   EXT. PINE VIEW STREETS - DAY                                    107 \nThe Postman rides with Briscoe, hurrying to stay alongside him. Half the town jogs along behind them. \nFORD Bethlehem is offering a 1000 pounds of gold to whoever brings you in. Dead or alive. \nTHE POSTMAN Thank God it wasn't a carton of cigarettes. \nBRISCOE I'd have shot you myself. \n108   EXT. PINE VIEW STREETS - NIGHT                                  108 \nPine View is throwing a party. It's in full swing. A couple of guitars. A banjo and a trombone. Everyone dances. \nThe Postman walks with Briscoe, sees Mrs. March as her letter is read to her. Catches a glimpse of Abby dancing with Ford. He seems, for the first time, truly happy. For that matter, so does Briscoe. \nBRISCOE Things are getting better. Getting better all the time. (a beat) I don't know who you are, but I do know I was wrong about you. \nThe Postman smiles, reaches in his bag for an envelope. \nTHE POSTMAN Got a letter for you, Sheriff. \nTHE POSTMAN That makes five. All on Southern routes. \n112   EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY                                        112 \nFive dead mail carriers have been laid out on the asphalt. Bethlehem walks the line, looking for his elusive arch- enemy. \nBETHLEHEM No.  No. Not him. No. (looks to soldiers) Children. I want a man and you bring me children! \n113   EXT. OREGON ROAD - DAY                                       113 \nA beautiful day. Ponytail rounds a bend at a lope -- and then -- her eyes widen in terror. She jerks the reins; the horse rears in protest. \nAhead: the truck stop. The five mail carriers hang upside down from the roof's overhang. A macabre sight. \nPOV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE \nSIGHTING ON Ponytail. A hand comes INTO FRAME and brings the rifle barrel down. It's -- \nGIBBS AND HOLNIST SHARPSHOOTER \nGIBBS Not yet. General wants the message to get back. \n114   EXT. RV. CAMP - NIGHT                                        114 \nPAN UP FROM The Postman's dusty boots TO his grimly determined face as he strides through camp and stops at Old George's trailer. \nHe moves OUT OF FRAME, revealing -- Abby and Ponytail in the b.g. \n115   INT. OLD GEORGE'S TRAILER - NIGHT                               115 \nAs usual, Old George is hunkered down before his short wave. He looks as the door opens and The Postman enters. \nTHE POSTMAN Tell me about the other stuff you know... \nGeorge crosses the trailer, opens a cabinet. Inside: twenty odd guns plus the parts for several more. The CROW CAWS. \n116   EXT. ELVIS, OREGON - DAY                                        116 \nQuiet. An old flag ruffles outside the post office -- the only new structure in town. Old George sweeps the porch as a patrol of ten Holnist soldiers ride into town. George makes no move to flee as they near. As they rein up across from him he just smiles and continues sweeping. \nSensing it, the Holnist officer looks up. There, on the roof, stands The Postman. Ford and Briscoe flank him -- along with twenty mailmen and locals, armed with guns, bows and rocks. \nAs the soldiers raise their rifles, the roofies OPEN FIRE. George whips up a sawed-off SHOTGUN. BOOM! Caught in the storm, the ten soldiers go down. \nGrim, The Postman looks to Ford as the locals cheer. George resumes sweeping. The mailmen climb down to strip the weapons off the dead. \nTHE POSTMAN Ford, I want you to get rid of the bodies. I don't want these people blamed for what we did. \nFord nods. \n117   EXT. HOLNIST ARMY CAMP - NIGHT                                  117 \nTwo sentries guard the east. They peer into the gloom at the sound of a WAGON APPROACHING. It sounds like it's coming fast. \nSENTRY Halt!   Identify yourself! \n(CONTINUED) \n117   CONTINUED:                                                     117 \nWAGON \ntearing along. Ford at the reins, urging the horses to all possible speed.  Then he stands, leaps to the ground. \nSENTRIES \nThey raise their rifles as the riderless wagon looms out of the night. They each get off a SHOT before being forced to dive out of the way. The wagon continues on, down to... \nHOLNIST CAMP \nA soldier finally grabs hold of one of the halters and brings the wagon to a stop. Half-dressed, Bethlehem steps up. A tarp covers the back upon which is written... \nBETHLEHEM (reading) Postage due... \nBethlehem yanks away the tarp to reveal the 10 dead Holnist soldiers. The men around Bethlehem exchange looks, can't believe it. Bethlehem bellows in rage. \n118   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                             118 \nFord, hidden in the woods, smiles at the sound. \n119   EXT. HOLNIST CAMP - NIGHT                                      119 \nBethlehem steps forward and shouts his challenge into the night. \nBETHLEHEM You want a war? I'll give you a war. I was born for it! \n120   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                             120 \nBethlehem's words reach Ford, his smile fades. He's just a scared boy. He kicks his horse into a gallop and rides away. \nCUT TO: \n121   EXT. SMALL AIRFIELD - DAY                                    121 \nIn the fog, the sound of hollow HOOF BEATS. The Postman rides past the shapes of airplanes. Standing silent. Forever grounded. The ghosts of the past. \n122   EXT. RV CAMP - DAY                                           122 \nFord is swearing in four new recruits. \nON FORD AND RECRUITS \nAs they repeat after him we realize they've changed the oath a bit. \nFORD/RECRUITS Neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom of night. Through bandit's hell, through fire fight. Through flood and plague we cannot fail. No Holnist trash will stop the mail. \nTHE POSTMAN \nriding his weary mount into town, saddlebags bulging with mail. He pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear the words they're saying. \nFORD Who's the other letter to? \nTHE POSTMAN Bethlehem. I'm taking it to him in the morning. \nFORD What does it say? \nTHE POSTMAN Mail's private. You know that. \nFORD What does it say? \nTHE POSTMAN (stops; turns) It says it's over. It says we quit. \n(CONTINUED) \n137   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                137 \nFORD It says you quit. What about the oath? \nTHE POSTMAN Tell me something, Ford. How much mail can a dead postman deliver? It's over. \nThe Postman starts to walk away again. \nFORD Then I'll take it. \nTHE POSTMAN I can't trust you. \nFord gathers courage and confronts The Postman. \nFORD If this is the end. If this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered. I'll take it. \nTHE POSTMAN Whoever takes this letter probably dies for it. \nFord thrusts out his hand. \nFORD I'm still a postman. You owe it to me... I owe it to me. \nThe Postman hesitates, studies the intense young man. Gives him the letter. \n138   EXT. R.V. CAMP - STABLE AREA - DAY                               138 \nThe Postman is packing bags onto a horse as Abby approaches. \nTHE POSTMAN I'm going to St. Rose, Abby. And I'm taking you with me. I know you don't want to hear it, but that's my child inside you. I want to see it born somewhere safe. I have a right to that, Abby. Whether you like it or not. \nAbby walks away. The Postman rests his head on his pack for a moment. Heavy. \n(CONTINUED) \n138   CONTINUED:                                                       138 \nThe CLICK of a GUN causes The Postman to lift his head and see Luke standing there. \nTHE POSTMAN Thought I recognized you. \nLUKE General Bethlehem said... (raises the pistol) ... You should be on your knees when I do it. \nTHE POSTMAN I don't give a damn what that asshole said. \nLUKE The general is a great man. \nTHE POSTMAN The general is a fucking lunatic. \nThe Postman steps forward. Stops when the barrel of the pistol is right against his own chest. \nTHE POSTMAN You don't own a thought in that goddamn head of yours, do you? (a beat) You want to see a man? \nThe Postman turns to watch as Ford starts out of camp. \nTHE POSTMAN That's a man. \nThe Postman turns, sees Luke's face fraught with confusion and emotion. \nTHE POSTMAN You don't understand, do you? You never will until you can think for yourself and be willing to pay the price for it. \nLuke stares back into The Postman's eyes.      A frozen beat. \nTHE POSTMAN You ready? \nABBY (O.S.) Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n138   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               138 \nAbby sits on her horse. She's witness to it all. Luke is confused and ashamed. The Postman mounts his horse and moves to Abby's side. \nTHE POSTMAN You're a better man than Bethlehem, Luke. I've seen it. \n139   EXT. RIDGE - R.V. CAMP - DAY                                    139 \nSome carriers drop their uniforms into a bonfire. \nThe Postman and Abby ride up on the ridge above the RV camp. They pause to look back one last time. Across the way, on the other side, Ford is doing the same thing. As though he senses it, Ford stops and looks back. \nFord raises his hand, salutes. Slowly, The Postman brings up his own hand. But he doesn't salute. He waves. Good- bye. As Ford turns away, so does The Postman. \nON CHUBBY, PONYTAIL AND CARRIER NAMED DREW \nwatching as The Postman and Abby disappear from sight. \nCHUBBY Guess Minneapolis is that way. \n140   EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY                                           140 \nA sign prohibits pedestrians, horses and bicycles. The Postman and Abby ride by. The Postman no longer wears his uniform. Their gear is packed behind their saddles. \nAs a family of transients begin to rise from where they're camped in the breakdown lane: \nTHE POSTMAN We can't help you. We're just as lost as you are. \nA wild-haired SQUATTER steps out on the porch as Abby and The Postman ride by. He waves hello with a .45. \nSQUATTER Howdy. Welcome to sunny California. \nTHE POSTMAN (re: the town) What happened here? \nSQUATTER Little accident. The ground started to shake big time and the Hanford nuclear plant went... (motions an explosion) ... 'Poof.' Destroyed everything for miles. But the sunsets are beautiful. \nTHE POSTMAN You ever hear of a city called St. Rose? \nSQUATTER Friend, I've never heard of St. Shit. \nThe Squatter laughs and laughs -- like it was the funniest thing in the world. The Postman and Abby exchange a look, continue on their way. \nSQUATTER Hey, don't go! I got Monopoly in the house! Boardwalk, Park Place and the Reading Railroad! \nCUT TO: \n145   EXT. EDGE OF RUBBLE - DAY                                         145 \nPonytail, Chubby, and Draw watching from afar.    Chubby has the telescope. \nCHUBBY You think that's President Starkey? \n(CONTINUED) \n145   CONTINUED:                                                        145 \nPonytail takes the telescope from Chubby for a look. \nPONYTAIL No. \nCHUBBY What makes you so sure? \nPONYTAIL President lives in a white house. That guy's place is gray. \nDrew and Chubby exchange a look.       That makes sense. \n146   EXT. SKY - DAY                                                    146 \nA lightning bolt shreds the sky.       It's day, but the sky is black with rain. \n147   EXT. HIGH TENSION TOWERS - DAY                                    147 \nThe useless towers cutting across a valley.      Rain beats down, as The Postman and Abby trudge along. \nUp ahead, a rail-road tunnel promises shelter from the storm. \nTHE POSTMAN (re: the tunnel) We can rest in there. \nAbby is quick to agree. \nOut of the corner of his eye, The Postman catches a blur of movement. \nHe turns his head quickly, but he's barely in time to see a wooden basket, attached to one of the high wires, swing from a distant tower. There's a sentry inside it. \nThe basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph, heading straight for an adjacent tower. In a matter of seconds, he's lost from view. \nThe Postman looks back at Abby.       She's shivering. \nTHE POSTMAN Did you see that? \nABBY (shaking her head) I'm hungry, Postman. \nThe Postman guides her toward the train tunnel. \n148   INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - DAY                                        148 \nAbby sleeps beside the fire. The Postman, silhouetted against the flames, heads toward the far tunnel exit. \n149   EXT. FAR SIDE OF TUNNEL - DAY                                  149 \nThe Postman peers into the rain, taking in the view of a distant bridge. Abby comes to stand at his side. \n150   EXT. COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE (BRIDGE CITY) - DAY                  150 \nA town settled between spans of a steel truss bridge. The Columbia River rushes far below. A sentry spots Abby and The Postman approaching, blows a whistle. \nGUARD Set the rifle on the ground. \nTHE POSTMAN This old thing? It isn't even loaded. Where are we? \nThe BRIDGE CITY MAYOR, a middle-aged retro-hippie, steps up. \nB.C. MAYOR You're in Bridge City. Where we don't allow guns. \nThe Postman sets down the carbine.    The Guard steps over to scoop it up. \nB.C. MAYOR Sentry said you were coming. \nThe Postman stares at the Mayor a beat. \nTHE POSTMAN I know you.     You're famous. \nB.C. MAYOR I was once. Not anymore. (beat) Are you looking to cross? \nTHE POSTMAN We will be. Right now, we'd just appreciate some food. (as the Mayor nods his assent) I got some kids behind me, too. \n(CONTINUED) \n150   CONTINUED:                                                       150 \nB.C. MAYOR How many? \nTHE POSTMAN Three. (as the Mayor agrees once more) Hey, guys, come on in! I know you're out there! \nCHUBBY SENTRY Boy, is he smart... \nAs they stand, show themselves. \nTHE POSTMAN Yes. \nB.C. MAYOR I've heard of you, man. You're famous. \nTHE POSTMAN Yeah, I guess I am. And all of a sudden, I'm not wearing the right clothes. \nAnd as he puts on his cap, he accepts the mantle as well. \n153   EXT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON PINE BOX - MORNING                       153 \nlowered from the top of the bridge. Hands reach up to steady it and bring it gently to the ground. It's one of many. \nThe Postman and Abby gasp as the Mayor opens the lid to reveal: 20 well-oiled rifles and 15 pistols with ammo. The Postman blinks over at the Mayor. \nB.C. MAYOR Fact that we don't allow 'em doesn't mean we don't have 'em. We're not stupid, after all. \nTHE POSTMAN I'm sorry I've brought this on you. \nB.C. MAYOR No need to be sorry. Long as we get our mail on time. \nPONYTAIL (O.S.) Ready for duty, sir. \nThe Postman looks over to see Ponytail, Drew and Chubby ride up. Like him, they are back in uniform. \nTHE POSTMAN The order was to burn all uniforms. \nThe carriers look away -- sheepish. \n(CONTINUED) \n153   CONTINUED:                                                         153 \nTHE POSTMAN You know what to do then? \nPONYTAIL Talk to the people. Gather who's willing. Tell them it's important. Tell them we can make a difference. \nCHUBBY SENTRY And tell 'em we're going to kick ass. \nTHE POSTMAN Yeah, tell them that, too. \n154   EXT. NEAR BRIDGE - DAY                                             154 \nAt the edge of the Gorge. The three carriers, and the mounted locals thunder off the bridge and down the road. High above... \n155   EXT. HIGH TENSION TOWER - POSTMAN AND ABBY                         155 \nThe Mayor is in the b.g. helping one of the sentries prepare the basket for travel. \nABBY This is hard for me. (beat) Michael was the best man I ever knew. I never thought there'd be another man I could love the way I loved him. (searching for the words) I don't know why I've been so blessed. And I've tried to find a way to be thankful, but I swear, if I lose you... \nHer eyes start to tear and he takes her in his arms. \nTHE POSTMAN Abby, do you think a lie can become the truth? \nABBY I don't know, but I believe in you. You have a gift, Postman.     I saw it back in Pine View.

You made Ford feel like he was part of the world. You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket. \nHe starts to speak.    She stops him, taking his hand. \nABBY When you come back, we'll be waiting here for you. So you can take us to St. Rose. \nThe Postman lets go of her hand and starts for the basket. \nThe Mayor gestures to the line of towers extending into the distance. \nB.C. MAYOR There's three good-sized towns up that way. Enough folks to be a big help to you. If you can convince them to come. \nAs The Postman steps into the basket, he makes the mistake of looking over the edge. It's a long, long way down. \nB.C. MAYOR A lot higher than it looks, huh? \nThe Postman looks at the contraption with more than a little trepidation. The Mayor grins. \nB.C. MAYOR Don't tell anybody, but I like to ride the damn thing just for the hell of it. Being a city official has its perks. \nHe winks and as he reaches for the release pin.     The Postman's hand meets his there. \nB.C. MAYOR Trust me, man. This'll get you there a lot faster. \nTHE POSTMAN How do I stop -- \nBut it's too late.    The Mayor releases the pin. \n(CONTINUED) \n155   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                155 \nB.C. MAYOR Don't worry about it.

Chubby rides along it, exhorting the people who watch from above. But it's The Postman we hear, all the magic back in his voice. \nTHE POSTMAN (V.O.) Once more into the breach, dear friends, once more. Or close the wall with our dead. In peace nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility. But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger. \n157   EXT. ELVIS, OREGON - NIGHT                                       157 \nBethlehem and The Postman riding toward each other. They meet when The Postman is almost three-quarters of the way over to the Holnists' side. \nBETHLEHEM AND POSTMAN \nAs they come face-to-face. \nBETHLEHEM My little shipping clerk. \nTHE POSTMAN We're both a couple of frauds. You know it; I know it. \nBethlehem sneers. \nBETHLEHEM Great men are made by other great men. Patton had Rommel. Grant had Lee. But I get you. \nTHE   POSTMAN You're no fucking   general. You're a copying machine   salesman. You're not even a   good painter. \nBETHLEHEM Are you trying to goad me into a fight? \nTHE POSTMAN Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them? We could settle this thing right here. You and me. \nBETHLEHEM Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. \nTHE POSTMAN It does in your army. \nThe Postman kicks his horse up into a gallop, and rides up the Holnist line. No one, least of all Bethlehem, is sure what's going on. \nTHE POSTMAN I invoke law seven of the Laws of Eight! Any man may challenge for leadership of the clan! \n(CONTINUED) \n165   CONTINUED:                                                      165 \nBETHLEHEM What? \nThe Postman wheels his horse around. \nTHE POSTMAN I challenge you. \nBethlehem is caught completely by surprise, but recovers. \nBETHLEHEM You're not a Holnist. You're not a member of the clan. You don't have the right. \nThe Postman rolls up his sleeve. He rides the Holnist lines displaying his brand for all to see. The Holnists murmur amongst themselves. \nTHE POSTMAN I have every right. I invoke law seven! \nBethlehem can't believe his eyes. \nTHE POSTMAN I challenge for leadership of the clan! \nThe seed of doubt is planted. Is Bethlehem violating one of the Laws of Eight? The men look at one another. Gibbs looks to Getty. Bethlehem looks from The Postman's tattoo to his face. \nBETHLEHEM Where do I know you from? \nTHE POSTMAN 'Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs of war.' Remember that? \nBETHLEHEM Shakespeare. The one who didn't want to fight. \nTHE POSTMAN I should've found a way to kill you then. But you seemed so strong. \nBETHLEHEM Law seven it is. (to all) This war is settled here! \n(CONTINUED) \n165   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 165 \nAs The Postman nods in agreement. \nThey take their positions -- and without a word -- they kick their horses into a charge. Coming straight for each other like medieval jousters. \nBethlehem reaches for his sword.    But before it clears the scabbard, The Postman lunges. \nThe horses collide.    Bethlehem and The Postman hit the ground hard. \nHolnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a better look. \nThe fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem are at each other like coiled snakes. \nIt's more of a fight than any of the Holnists -- especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in tighter. \nBoth combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches. \nOne of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise. \nIt's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand -- grabs The Postman's throat with the other. \nBETHLEHEM I study people. I know your problem. Do you know why you can't fight? \nThe Postman can't answer. \nBETHLEHEM You have nothing to fight for. You don't care about anything. You don't value anything. You don't believe in anything. That's what makes me better. \nThe Postman grabs Bethlehem's knife-hand -- using all his remaining strength to keep him at bay. \nTHE POSTMAN (barely audible) I believe in the United States Postal Service. \n(CONTINUED) \n165   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 165 \nThe Postman lets go of Bethlehem's hands, grabs his belt and pulls him over. As they roll to their feet, The Postman club-fists Bethlehem on the side of the head. \nTHE POSTMAN Neither snow... (wham!) Nor rain... (wham!) Nor heat... (wham!) Nor gloom of night... (wham!) Will stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds... \nBethlehem reels, stumbling back. The Postman pounces on top of him, begins to strangle him. Bethlehem tries to pry the fingers from his throat, but can't. He's going to die. \nThe Postman is urged on. By both sides. Holnists. Carriers. Ford. Even Holnist Luke. He looks up at the faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go. The General gasps for breath. \nAs Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford, The Postman looks to both sides. \n", "test1_input": "But these people won't be denied.

'Things are getting better, getting better all the time.' \nThere's warm applause at that.    Several people try the expression out on each other. \nMAN #3 He a Democrat or a Republican? \nTHE POSTMAN Parties are over with. The individual is what counts. You vote for the best man. \nEllen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of The Postman. Famished, he digs in. \nMAN #4 What about Europe? Any word? \nThe Postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food. \nTHE POSTMAN Lady Di's in charge. Sixty years old and she still kicks ass. \nWOMAN #3 Is Nathan Holn still alive? \nTHE POSTMAN (smiles at irony) He died. Skin cancer. \nThat's sure good news to everyone.       But... \nWOMAN #4 And the Holnists? They're still out there. What's the government going to do about them? \nThe Postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important question of all. He doesn't want to lie. \nTHE POSTMAN The government's just getting started. You're on your own for at least eighteen months. \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              35 \nMAN #5 What about the Marines Corp? \nA clamor of Holnist questions. \nELLEN Be quiet, everyone! Can't we just let this man eat? \nThe people nod and The Postman finally gets to eat. He catches sight of Briscoe watching him from the door. After a moment, Briscoe leaves. \n36   INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - LATER                                   36 \nA band plays an odd array of instruments. There's dancing. The Postman sits behind four empty bowls. People watch him eat like it was a religious experience. He pushes back the fifth bowl. \nTHE POSTMAN Never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I can't eat anymore. \nHe's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy.    The kid's looking up, staring intently at something. \nTHE POSTMAN What? \nThe boy just stares. \nTHE POSTMAN (re:   the cap) This? \nThe boy nods. The Postman shakes his head and smiles to himself. He takes off the cap, sets it on the kid's head. \nTHE POSTMAN Almost fits. \nThe boy's eyes go wide with wonder. His stock's gone up 1000%. Before he can rush off to impress his friends, ELLEN -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him. \nELLEN That's not a toy, honey. That's very important. Give it back. \n(CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:                                                          36 \nThe boy carefully removes the cap, hands it back to The Postman. Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her son away. \nThe Postman shrugs, turns to find Abby, the pretty woman we saw at the Pine View gates. She smiles at The Postman. \nABBY Would you like to dance? \nTHE POSTMAN I don't know if I can, I think I'm still on duty. \nHe laughs.    Abby says nothing. \nTHE POSTMAN It's been a long time. \nAbby holds out her hand like a promise. \nABBY All you got to do is hold on. \nDANCE FLOOR \nAbby and The Postman dance.          She keeps looking him over. \nTHE POSTMAN Is something wrong? \nABBY How tall are you? \nTHE POSTMAN About six feet. \nABBY Are you smart? \nTHE POSTMAN Smarter than some I guess.       Why? \nABBY Just wondering. Did you ever have the bad mumps? \nThe Postman smiles.    She's odd, but beautiful. \nTHE POSTMAN Never had the bad mumps. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_true": "ABBY Have you ever had herpes or syphilis or anything like that? \nHe shakes his head \"no.\"    They continue to dance. \nABBY So as far as you know, you have good semen? \nTHE POSTMAN Is that a trick question? \nABBY I don't mean to be nosy. I'm only asking because I want you to make me pregnant. \nStunned, The Postman stops dancing.      Abby takes this moment to grab Michael. \nTHE POSTMAN (to himself) It's got to be the uniform. \nAbby takes Michael's arm, introduces him proudly. \nABBY This is my husband.    Michael. \nMichael smiles, shakes hands with a grave-digger's grip. The Postman doesn't know what to think. \nABBY We've been trying to have a baby for three years. We can't on account of Michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve. So we need a body father. We could ask a man here, but it could cause trouble. I've seen it happen. Things go okay until the woman starts to show. Then it can be bad. But you'll only be around once in awhile with the mail. \nThe Postman just stares at them.      Abby looks to Michael. \nABBY He hasn't said 'no'. \n(CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              36 \nMICHAEL (undaunted) What do you say, mister?     You'd be doing us a favor. \nTHE POSTMAN I'll have to think about it. \nThe Postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away, shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world. \nBut no rest for the wicked, as soon as he's free from Abby and Michael, he's running smack into another group of well-wishing TOWNIES. Mrs. March is among them. She's holding an envelope. \nTOWNIE #1 Mrs. March wants to give you something. (to Mrs. March) He's right here, Irene. \nMRS. MARCH (re: letter) It's to my daughter Annie. She left five years ago. She was only fifteen. The last I heard, she was living up north... \nThe Postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the faces around him, to Mrs. March. She looks blindly back. How can he lie to her? \nTHE POSTMAN Look, Mrs. March, you should know that... \nMRS. MARCH Know what? \nTHE POSTMAN Know that... \nBut she stops him, grabs for his hand. \nMRS. MARCH I have a feeling about you. I know you'll do what's right. \nHer hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd. She's left him with her letter and no choice at all. \nTHE POSTMAN I got to get out of here. \n37   EXT. PINE VIEW - NIGHT                                         37 \nThe Postman moves through town. The streets are deserted. He's got his pack on, his mailbag. He passes a 7-11 converted to a blacksmith shop. There's a horse tethered to the railing in front of it. He grins; maybe he's going to make it out of here after all. As he starts to move toward the horse... \nOLD MAN (O.S.) It's right around the corner. \nAn OLD MAN sits on his porch across the street. \nTHE POSTMAN (freezes, startled) What is? \nOLD MAN What you're looking for. \nThe Old Man winks knowingly, then heads inside. As The Postman turns the corner, he finds himself in front of the post office. An old brick building. Chiseled in the granite facing: \"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE. EST. 1884.\" \n38   INT. POST OFFICE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                           38 \nLong ago stripped, it still has a proud, official, almost holy feel. The Postman wanders in, stops to read the credo calligraphied on the wall. \"Neither snow, nor rain...\" He turns at a SOUND. Ford is here, leaning against a wall. \nFORD I knew you'd come here. \nTHE POSTMAN You did, huh? \nFord nods.    A sage sixteen-year-old. \nFORD How do you get to be a postman, anyhow? \nTHE POSTMAN You have to be in the right place at the right time. \nFORD How could I do it? \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:                                                     38 \nTHE POSTMAN I thought you wanted to drive cars. \nFORD Not anymore. That was kid's stuff. This is real. So, where's the right place? \nTHE POSTMAN Could be anywhere. Anytime. Only another postman can make you a postman. \nFORD Kinda like vampires, right? \nTHE POSTMAN Something like that. You have to be sworn in. \nFord raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the oath. It takes The Postman a moment to realize. \nTHE POSTMAN The organization's kinda shaky.

Chubby grins. \nFORD Gather 'round, everybody. Got another letter here. Came in last night. \nBuzzing with excitement, the carriers gather around Ford. \nSOUTH END OF BOULEVARD \nPonytail leads Abby and The Postman. They come up in the back of the crowd.

Ponytail looks over. \nPONYTAIL His letters are always kind of short. \nAbby and The Postman exchange a look. \nFORD (looks up) Hold on now. There's a P.S... Anybody know what P.S. stands for? \nThe Postman raises his hand. Ford looks his way. His mouth drops as he realizes. In silence, he walks over to The Postman. They embrace and all the weight Ford's been carrying on his young shoulders suddenly falls to The Postman. The kid nearly collapses. \nCHUBBY Holy shit... \nRED That would be H.S., Chubby. \nCHUBBY I seen him once when I lived in Benning. It's The Postman! \nWord goes through the crowd like a wave. \nThe Postman takes the letter, reads. \nTHE POSTMAN P.S.

RISE ABOVE PINE VIEW - DAY                                  126 \nThe Postman wheels his horse around. But Ford, Ponytail, Chubby and Luke are standing in his way. \nFORD What are you going to do? \nTHE POSTMAN I'm going to stop this. \nFORD You can't. \n(CONTINUED) \n126   CONTINUED:                                                        126 \nTHE POSTMAN Get out of my way, Ford. All of you. \nFORD (shaking his head) They'll kill you. \nThe Postman starts to ride through them.      Luke, Chubby and Ponytail move their horses to block. \nFord maneuvers his horse in close and grabs The Postman's harness. \nTHE POSTMAN Goddamnit -- \nThe Postman jumps off his horse. Ford tackles him. The Postman shoves him away, continues on. Luke and Chubby pounce on him. With Ford's help, they hold him down. \nFORD You can't help them! \nTHE POSTMAN There's still time, Ford! \nThe Postman struggles.      They're genuinely having trouble holding him down. \nPONYTAIL (re: The Postman) You're hurting him. \nBut there's no let-up. \nFORD No, this is all my doing.    I went against your orders. \nThere's a moment of shocked surprise. \nFORD The Holnists we killed. You told me to bury them. But I didn't. I sent Bethlehem the bodies. \nTHE POSTMAN Why? \nFORD Because Bethlehem has to know that we're not going to stop. \n(CONTINUED) \n126   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                126 \nTHE POSTMAN God damn you, Ford. Those people down there are dying because of us. Because of what we did. \nFORD Bullshit. They're dying because of Bethlehem. They're dying because this is a shitty world. And if we're ever going to change it, then somebody might have to die. If I could make it be me down there I would. But I can't. \nA terrible SCREAM gives them all pause. \n127   EXT. PINE VIEW - DAY                                             127 \nDown below -- Holnist soldiers hold back a screaming mother as her 10-year-old boy is pulled into the line. \nSheriff Briscoe is among the ten, he puts his hand on the boy's shoulder -- the picture of grace under pressure. \n128   EXT. RISE ABOVE PINE VIEW - ON POSTMAN AND CARRIERS              128 \nTHE POSTMAN My God, what have I done? (beat) We don't even know their names... \n129   EXT. PINE VIEW - CLOSE ON LITTLE BOY - DAY                       129 \nHis eyes wide and fearful.    Like a kitten's. \n130   EXT. RISE ABOVE PINE VIEW - DAY                                  130 \nPONYTAIL (holding back the tears) We know their names. The little one's my brother. His name is Billy. \nA moment of stunned silence. \nPONYTAIL What Ford did was wrong. But it doesn't change anything for any of us. Does it? \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test3_true": "She looks to the other carriers -- it's written all over their faces -- they stand with Ponytail and Ford. \n131   EXT. PINE VIEW - DAY                                              131 \nBethlehem looks the line-up over. The firing squad stands at the ready. Bethlehem looks to the trees -- feeling something. \nBETHLEHEM (to Getty) He's out there somewhere. Watching. I can feel it. \nBriscoe follows his gaze. He doesn't see anything, but maybe gets the same feeling. Bethlehem looks to Briscoe. \nBETHLEHEM You feel it too, don't you? Didn't have to end like this, Sheriff. He knew where I'd be if he wanted to face me like a man. Instead, he's hiding like a rabbit. So much for your Postman. \nGIBBS Ready!    Aim! \nRifles are raised. Briscoe seems to grow as he throws his shoulders back and shouts... \nBRISCOE Ride, Postman! Ride! You hear me? I said ride! \n132   EXT. RISE ABOVE PINE VIEW - DAY                                   132 \nThe WORDS ECHO.       Nothing The Postman can do, but watch. \n133   EXT. PINE VIEW - DAY                                              133 \nBethlehem's eyes go wild -- \nBETHLEHEM Fire! \nThe RIFLES BARK.      Everyone falls dead. \n134   EXT. RISE ABOVE PINE VIEW - DAY                                   134 \nSomething in The Postman breaks. He just lies there.       The witnesses move back, taking The Postman with them. \n135   EXT. PINE VIEW - DAY                                             135 \nSheriff Briscoe lies dead.   The letter from his sister blows from his hand. \nCUT TO: \n136   INT. AIRSTREAM - NIGHT                                           136 \nThe Postman folds a letter, shoves it into an envelope. He writes \"Bethlehem\" across the front, starts to write a second letter. The door opens and Abby enters. \nABBY Ford thinks you're going to do something. \nTHE POSTMAN I am. \nThe Postman watches as, outside, the mail carriers begin to assemble. \nTHE POSTMAN If I don't, those kids are going to keep on getting themselves killed. \nABBY Ford doesn't know what it means to be a kid. He doesn't have your memories. None of them do. All they've got is the lousy world we gave them. And this is the only decent thing in it. \nTHE POSTMAN What? Being a postman? It's all bullshit, Abby. All of it. (beat) I took this uniform off a skeleton to stay warm. I made up the rest to stay fed. There is no restored United States. \nABBY I knew it was something like that. \nThe Postman fingers the brim of the cap, softens. \n(CONTINUED) \n136   CONTINUED:                                                      136 \nTHE POSTMAN Weird thing is, being a Postman was almost the best thing that ever happened to me... (re: red ribbon) Remember this? You left it behind that night. \nABBY I remember... \nTHE POSTMAN I always liked to think you left it on purpose. But maybe you just forgot it. \nAbby doesn't answer.    She leaves instead. \n137   EXT. R.V. CAMP - NIGHT                                          137 \nTwelve mail carriers, including Ford, Ponytail, Chubby, Luke and Old George, wait as The Postman steps up before them. Abby's off to the side. \nTHE POSTMAN Is this everybody? \nFORD The rest are on the overdue list. \nTHE POSTMAN This is everybody. (for all) Got a letter from President Starkey. \nAn excited murmur among the carriers. Only Ford eyes The Postman suspiciously. The Postman reads: \nTHE POSTMAN 'Greetings all carriers.' \nCARRIERS Greetings, President Starkey! \nTHE POSTMAN (reading) 'I've been in contact with The Postman. I've received all the reports. I'm proud of you all.' \nHe looks at them, doesn't need to read what's in his heart. \n(CONTINUED) \n137   CONTINUED:                                                      137 \nTHE POSTMAN In dark days, in a weary world, you gave everything and asked for nothing. You beat back despair and replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you. But the price is too high. I won't see anymore of my bravest die. It is my duty to hereby disband the Postal Service of the restored United States. You are to burn your uniforms and The Postman is to return to Minneapolis at once. Thank you and that is all. \nA hushed silence. The Postman walks away. The carriers exchange tired, defeated looks. Abby just sighs, knows he's not necessarily wrong. \nFord catches up with The Postman.    He stares at The Postman; The Postman stares back. \nFORD (low; fierce) The President never wrote that letter. \nTHE POSTMAN If he could've that's what he would have said. \nFord gestures to the second letter. \n"}

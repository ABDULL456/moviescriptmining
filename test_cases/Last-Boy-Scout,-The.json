{"test1_input": "ANGLE ON STAGE Onstage, the MUSIC GRINDS TO a CLOSE as Cory dispenses with the last of her clothing. Strikes a pose to wild applause and we HOLD ON her radiant beauty and -- CUT TO: \nINT. DINGY DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nCory and Jimmy are engaged in very hot sex. This is not a love scene; this is a sex scene. Sigh. I'm not even going to attempt to write this quote-unquote \"steamy\" scene here, for several good reasons: A)   The things that I find steamy are none of your damn business, Jack, in addition to which -- B)   The two actors involved will no doubt have wonderful, highly athletic ideas which manage to elude most fat-assed writers anyhow, and finally -- C)   My mother reads this shit.   So there. (P.S.: I think we lost her back at the Jacuzzi blowjob scene.) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Suffice to say, they fog the screen. At last, Jimmy rolls over and pours champagne into two crystal glasses. Lifts one in a toast. JIMMY Alex the pediatrician. CORY (giggles) Alex the pediatrician. They drink.   And from this blissful affirmation of life we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME TIME Joe Hallenbeck is pounding an already-dented cigarette machine. No dice. It has eaten his money. He shakes his head, muttering. Looks at his watch. Looks at the dressing room door. Shakes his head again. Walks to the end of the corridor. Goes through the fire door. Out into: \nEXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION Starry, moonlit night.   A chill breeze.   Joe draws a breath. In front of him, on the wall of the club, is a poster: BAYNARD FOR SENATE, it reads. Above the logo, a picture of a benevolent-looking gray-haired man. Hallenbeck regards it balefully. HALLENBECK I didn't vote for you, you bastard. He looks away, and suddenly notices something on the ground: A half-smoked cigarette butt. Just sitting there. Joe stares at it. Thinks it over. Starts to walk away. Stops. HALLENBECK You're a fuckin' lowlife, Joe. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He bends to pick up the butt. A steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches. Hallenbeck spins, startled. Reflexively lashes out with a flattened palm. Misses, chops the air. Two more men, behind him. Nowhere to go. A sap pops him behind the left ear. A sickening thud. The world spins out of focus. He goes down. Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks. Rolls over, staring up. Vision muddy, indistinct. \nHALLENBECK'S POV \nThree silhouettes hover over him, backlit by streetlamps. Their voices are fuzzy. HITMAN #1 That's him.   He was with her. HITMAN #2 Shit, he's packing. What should we do? HITMAN #3 Get him away from here.   Then kill him. HITMAN #2 There's no contract for him. HITMAN #3 Then do it for free. Just do it elsewhere. \nThe men disperse. One of them drags Joe to his feet. A stocky, crag-faced man. He jams a silenced pistol in Joe's kidney and points him toward a vacant lot nearby. HITMAN #2 Start walking. I'm right behind you. \nANOTHER ANGLE The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the nightclub. Waiting. (CONTINUED) \nEXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT A rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule- vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass. A rusted-out car. A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell. Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot. The crag-faced man follows behind him. CRAG-FACE (HITMAN #2) Wrong place at the wrong time, buddy, that's all it is. Just want you to know it's nothing personal. HALLENBECK That's what you think. Last night I fucked your wife. The gunman cracks up.   Hallenbeck grins drunkenly. CRAG-FACE Oh, you did, huh? How'd you know it was my wife? HALLENBECK She said her husband was a greaseball with bad breath. The guy cracks up again. CRAG-FACE You're pretty cool for a guy gonna take a bullet. HALLENBECK After fucking your wife, I'll take two. The hitman wheezes laughter.   Joe just grins. CRAG-FACE You're a funny guy. It's a shame to take you off. Here, kneel down. HALLENBECK Are you kidding? We barely know each other. The hitman is now giggling, shaking his head. CRAG-FACE This is wild. I never shot no funny guy before. (CONTINUED) \n", "test1_true": "CRAG-FACE How fat is she? HALLENBECK She's so fat I had to roll her in flour and look for the wet spot. You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap her thigh and ride the wave in. (the hitman loses it) Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except when you poke her in the stomach, she farts. I got a buddy he's an archaeologist, organized an expedition to her chin. They got lost in her nasal hair. But seriously, her eyes are like the streets of Paris: crossed. They're so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back. She's got back-tearia. \nCRAG-FACE (can't stop laughing) Oh, that's awful. Buddy, you're a fucking rio -- From a kneeling position, Hallenbeck flings a handful of gravel at the man's eyes. The man cries out. Stumbles backward. And Hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring. Not drunk at all. He takes  the broken bottle he's been clutching and cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter. The hitman stands with a shocked look on his face. Blood bubbling. FIRES the GUN once, into the ground. Drops it from nerve- less fingers. Stares at Hallenbeck, aghast. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: CRAG-FACE Bastard. Hallenbeck meets his gaze.    A savage, feral gleam in his eye. HALLENBECK And then some. The guy pitches over dead. Hallenbeck kneels beside him. Retrieves his .38, holsters it.       Slips the hitman's pistol into his waistband. \nHALLENBECK I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th. He takes off running. \nEXT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT Cory and Jimmy emerge from the club into the parking lot. She scans the area, shaking her head. CORY I can't believe it. The bastard split on me. (sighs) I'm staying at a motel for a couple days. Will you follow me? JIMMY Sure. \nHe heads for his car. \nANOTHER ANGLE The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan. Watching Jimmy and Cory. The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car. In his lap is an automatic rifle. \nEXT. BOULEVARD - NIGHT Joe Hallenbeck is running full out. Headlong down the sidewalk.       Gasping for breath. HALLENBECK Move!! (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He slams into a man. Knocks him flat. Groceries fly. Joe doesn't care. He stumbles. Keeps going. \nEXT. NIGHTTIME STREET - SAME TIME Jimmy Dix is behind the wheel of a silver Jag. Cory is driving a spanking new Ford Fiero. Jimmy follows behind Cory, watchdogging. Humming with JOE COCKER on the RADIO. Cory comes to a red light.    Pauses.   Turns right onto a sidestreet. Jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection. \nGRAY SEDAN passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE REVVING. Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car. It's enough: Everyone inside is armed to the teeth. The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of Jimmy. JIMMY Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking hit!! \nGRAY SEDAN comes up behind Cory. Comes up fast. Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile: \nJIMMY frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch -- And stalls out. He roars with anger. Flings open the door. Leaps out and runs forward, screaming: JIMMY Cory, get out of there!! Too late.    Cory is already out of her car, yelling: CORY Hey, can't you fucking drive?? (CONTINUED) \n", "test1_id": 576, "test2_input": "SERIES OF SHOTS - JIMMY'S PREPARATION \nJimmy lashes the boat. Goes below. Grabs a tuxedo from the closet. Stands, dressed, in front of the mirror. Opens a box. Removes a 9 millimeter Baretta. Works the slide. Jacks a bullet into the cylinder. Stashes it in the waistband of his pants: In back. Concealed by the tuxedo. Studies his own grim face in the mirror. JIMMY Okay, hot shit, let's do it. \nEXT. DECK - NIGHT Jimmy emerges from the cabin.    Heads for the rail. A voice calls out: \nDARIAN (O.S.) Nice tux. He turns, and sees Darian Hallenbeck. Peeking her head out from under a tarpaulin. JIMMY Goddammit, I told you to go home! DARIAN Fuck you, I stowed away.    They're my parents, okay? Jimmy shakes his head.   Exasperated. JIMMY Fine, whatever. Just stay here. With the boat. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Darian starts to protest. He throws her the keys. JIMMY Anything funny happens, get the fuck out of here. Darian takes the keys.   Frowns, says: DARIAN You look terrible. JIMMY I feel terrible. \nDARIAN Are you really a drug addict? JIMMY I was.   I kicked the habit. DARIAN When? JIMMY This morning.    Stay here. He swings over the side, onto the dock. DARIAN Don't let them break your other arm. JIMMY Thanks, kid.    You're a fuckin' inspiration. \nINT. MILO'S YACHT - CABIN - SAME TIME Milo speaks to Hallenbeck.   Clipped.    Businesslike. MILO At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved. He and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea. HALLENBECK Jesus. He thinks he's geting his two-million-dollar payoff. Milo nods.   Points to two identical suitcases in the corner. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MILO Baynard will not leave his boat. One of his men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase. This suitcast. He opens one of the cases.   Hallenbeck stares. \nHUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS Twenty thousand of them, to be precise.   Neatly bundled. MILO Then we pull a simple switch. When the man returns to his boat, he's carrying this suitcase. He points to the identical twin. HALLENBECK Plastics? MILO (nods) Detonation upon opening. Enough to kill the passengers, not enough to sink the craft. (smiles) And when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage, the police will draw the inevitable conclusion: a down-on-his-luck P.I. makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a career. \nHALLENBECK That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred? With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth. Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline. MILO Maybe I'll get to hear you scream, after all... Just then, one of Milo's crew sticks his head in the door. CREW MEMBER You better get up here, we got a problem. \nEXT. YACHT - ON DECK - NIGHT Milo's yacht is anchored about a half mile offshore. Island lights blink in the distance. Fog rolls in. Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck. Crosses to the railing, looks down at: \nFISHING BOAT bobbing in the water about thirty yards away. A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them. Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son. FISHERMAN Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine casing, I'm dead in the water! Can I get a tow? Milo swears under his breath.    Calls out: MILO I'm sorry, sir. This boat is Island Security, we're under strict orders to stay within this sector. FISHERMAN Aw, shit!     Look, it'll take ten minutes! MILO I'm sorry, we can't help you. FISHERMAN Goddammit, now I gotta call the Coast Guard! Milo's crewman steps up to the rail.    Speaks urgently: CREW MEMBER Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast Guard down on top of us. Milo ponders for maybe three seconds.    Then he calls out: MILO Excuse me.     Sir? The Fisherman turns.    His family beside him. MILO Fuck you, sir. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He reaches under his Windbreaker. Pulls out an Ingram model MACHINE GUN. OPENS FIRE. The entire family is blown away. WOOD SPLINGERS POP and fly. GLASS SHATTERS. The bodies topple like broken toys. Milo ceases fire.   Turns to his crewman. MILO Problem solved. Get over there and put the bodies below where they can't be seen. He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred. \n", "test2_true": "The head for the boats. Jimmy stares after them, mind racing. Makes a decision: heads for the boats. Following Baynard. \nINT./EXT. JIMMY'S BOAT - NIGHT Jimmy casts off the lines. Heads for the cockpit. Darian is inside. JIMMY Gimmee the keys, kiddo. DARIAN Where are you going? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: JIMMY The Senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door. I'm gonna follow him. He keys the ignition. JIMMY Get off the boat. DARIAN Fuck you, man. No way. JIMMY Darian, Goddammit -- \nShe runs below decks. DARIAN (O.S.) I'm not coming out! Jimmy looks up: The Senator's boat, a sleek, powerful Marlineer, is even now pulling out of the cove. JIMMY Okay.     Shit.   Okay.   Easy.   Shit. He throttles forward. The Hatteras pulls away from the dock. CUT TO: \nEXT. SKY - NIGHT \nThe sound of THUNDERING ROTORS, as a refitted Bell Cobra HELICOPTER cuts through the night sky over Catalina. Banks sharply, cruises offshore. \nINT. COCKPIT - SAME The PILOT works the stick while the CO-PILOT searches the water below through infra-red binoculars. He speaks into a microphone. CO-PILOT This is Air One, over. MALE (V.O.) Roger, Air One, over. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: CO-PILOT The drop zone is clear, repeat, the drop zone is clear, over. INTERCUT WITH: \nMILO'S YACHT - SAME TIME Milo is at the other end of the connection. Beside him, two crewmen. MILO Roger, Air One, over and out. (replaces the mike) Up anchor, gentlemen, we have a go. (points to Hallenbeck) Gag him and stash him. As Milo goes topside, one of the men tapes Joe's mouth. The other opens a cramped storage compartment. They stuff him inside.   Shut and lock the door. \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT About two miles offshore. The Senator's Marlineer cuts through the waves, converging with Milo's yacht. The two boats pull up alongside.    The lines are made fast. One of Milo's crewmen greets Senator Baynard's AIDE, a slick-looking Italian in a $1,000 overcoat. \nBaynard's man hops from one boat to the other. Boarding Milo's yacht. Meanwhile -- \nEXT. OFFSHORE WATERS - IN FOGBANK Jimmy Dix is clearly lost. He bangs his fist in frustration. JIMMY Goddammit, I lost him.     I can't see a fucking thing. DARIAN See if this boat has sonar. JIMMY Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DARIAN Fuck you. JIMMY Watch your mouth. DARIAN Take a bath in my ass. They're clearly having no fun. CUT TO: \n", "test2_id": 577, "test3_input": "And the funny thing is, he's really good. Pablo overcomes his shock. PABLO Shit, is he doing that? Hallenbeck's face remains cold.    Expressionless. HALLENBECK Furry Tom, tell Pablo what I'm gonna do to him. HALLENBECK (as Furry Tom) You're gong to make Pablo eat all his teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Pablo can't help it.   He bursts out laughing. PABLO That's amazing, man! Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes the furry head bob back and forth. HALLENBECK (as Furry Tom) Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. That's not very nice. By now, all three hoods are in hysterics. \nHALLENBECK Are you mad, Furry Tom? HALLENBECK (as Furry Tom) I don't get mad. I get even. And, with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens -- And EXPLODES, showering stuffing. One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half his throat is gone... And Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again, and the second goon goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed already -- Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas. Pablo is a little sharper. A little quicker. He dives forward, knocks the puppet from Joe's hand. Joe drives upward, into Pablo's gut. They reel across the room. Locked in combat. Lamps topple. GLASS BREAKS. Pablo slams Joe's head into the wall.   Leaves a dent. Does it again, a sickening impact... Starts to strangle Joe -- And the truth is, Joe's not thirty anymore. He's not going to make it. The world swims away. Then, as if through a tunnel, Joe notices something beside him... something hanging on the wall. Fights to focus. Breath gone.    Strength gone. Identifies the object: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: His Presidential Medal of Valor. Shiny medal. Shiny ribbon. His name... It hits him quite suddenly: The medal has sharp edges. With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the wall. Drives it into Pablo's throat. The big man stumbles backward. Eyes wide. Gurgling. He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely from his gushing neck. Drops to the dusty carpet.    Dies. \nHallenbeck takes a deep breath. Eyes wide. Insane. He is surrounded by corpses. He takes another deep breath. Picks up the sniper rifle. Slings it over his shoulder. Heads for the door. \nINT. CONRAD MARCON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Jimmy Dix is on the floor, and Marcon is kicking him savagely. Pointed alligator boots lashing out. Again and again. MARCON You know I don't enjoy doin' this, Jim. Jimmy curls up in a fetal ball.    Marcon paces, shaking his head. \nMARCON I remember how much you hated the pain... You got hooked on Demerol, didn't you...? I'll make a deal with you. Tell me who you talked to, and I'll give you all the painkillers you can swallow. JIMMY Nobody knows. Just... just me... and Hallenbeck... MARCON Now, see, I'd love to believe you. But we are talking about the future of my football team. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He crosses to the fireplace.   Removes a poker. MARCON And ain't nothin' more important than my ball club, 'cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs. Got one of yours, you know. (softly) Who'd you talk to, Jimmy? JIMMY Nobody... Marcon raises the poker. Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT Hallenbeck leaves the rented Subaru by the side of the road. He is dressed in combat black. Government issue. Rifle over one shoulder. Hunting knife in a hip scabbard. Like an angel of death, he moves into the brush. Heading down the canyon. \nEXT. MARCON'S HOME - SAME TIME An armed sentry patrols the grounds. Below him, nighttime L.A. stretches to the Pacific. Joe Hallenbeck emerges like a wraith from the trees. Clamps a gloved hand over the sentry's mouth. Drives the hunting knife into his back. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME Marcon stirs the fireplace logs, stoking the blaze. Replaces the poker. Crosses to his desk and sits. Jimmy is on the carpet, delirious.   Out of it. Marcon presses a button.   An armed HARDGUY appears. HARDGUY Mr. Marcon? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MARCON He's nothing, he can't hurt us. Take him somewhere and kill him. HARDGUY Yes, sir. The Hardguy crosses the room.      Grips Jimmy by the shoulders. With a soft SPIT of sound, his forehead blooms crimson. He collapses, lifeless. At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as: \nJOE HALLENBECK steps through the French doors behind him. He resembles nothing human. A demon in black. Eyes burning. Gun held loosely. An extension of his arm. Marcon reaches for the button to summon help. HALLENBECK Don't. He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly crushing his larynx. Hisses: HALLENBECK The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin' kill you. Where's my wife? MARCON I... I don't remember, I... Joe shoves on the gun.   The barrel chokes him. HALLENBECK My wife. Grabs a pen.   Shoves it in Marcon's hand. HALLENBECK The address.    Now! MARCON It's... Milo's film studio... HALLENBECK Write it down, dumbfuck. (CONTINUED) \n", "test3_true": "The Strange Man chuckles. STRANGE MAN Sorry, but that won't work. I don't care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun. A pause. Once more, Joe calculates the odds.     No dice. He places the rifle on the desk. STRANGE MAN Walk over there by your friend, Joe. Hallenbeck turns around... and, for once, his jaw drops. He's looking at a man he never thought he'd see again. A man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head bounced off the Georgetown turnpike eight years ago. \nLOUIS BAYNARD Son of the late senator. The right side of his face doesn't quite match the left. The muscles don't work. Hallenbeck recovers his composure. As Jimmy climbs to his feet, Joe walks over and stands next to him. Two gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear. HALLENBECK Well, Goddamn. How's the head, Lou? BAYNARD (STRANGE MAN) Aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely. \nHALLENBECK Next time, Lou, just say no. JIMMY Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face! Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid.   He snaps at Baynard: MARCON You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me! BAYNARD Nothing more or less than you'd do for me, Conrad. (turns) I never thought I'd see you again, Joe. \nHALLENBECK Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here? BAYNARD Call it a financial partnership. For a price, I agreed to connect Mr. Marcon to the necessary people in Washington. HALLENBECK In other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: BAYNARD (ignores him) But imagine my delight this morning, Joe, when Mr. Marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime... What can I say, inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist? HALLENBECK Do I also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess? BAYNARD (sighs) It was I, unfortunately, who bought a forty-dollar bottle of champagne... spoke a little too freely to that hooker. JIMMY She wasn't a hooker, dickhead. HALLENBECK He should know, Jimmy. With a face like that, he's gotta be paying for it. BAYNARD You can die fast or slow, so watch your mouth. Jimmy chimes in: JIMMY We'd rather watch yours.   It's goofy-lookin'. Marcon has had enough.   He pounds his fist on the desk. MARCON Kill them, Goddammit, waste 'em both! JIMMY Any bright ideas, Joe? HALLENBECK Gimmee a minute. JIMMY Excuse me, could you give him a minute? He's trying to think of a way out of this. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Behind them, the two hardguys COCK their GUNS. Jimmy sweats. He's scared shitless underneath. Hallenbeck clears his throat: HALLENBECK You know of course, Connie, that you're a dead man. Marcon holds up his hand. MARCON Wait. The gunmen lower their weapons. \nMARCON Let's humor this asshole.     What are you talking about? HALLENBECK (shrugs) Nothing much, just that I made a phone call from the boat on the way in. MARCON You called the cops? Fuck it, they can't prove a thing. HALLENBECK Oh, but I didn't call the cops.      I called the mob. Marcon stares at him.   Blinks. \nHALLENBECK See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. If you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government. (beat) I wouldn't be surprised if they put out a contract on you. Of course, I might be able to call it off. Marcon stares him down.    A pause.   Then Marcon smiles: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MARCON He's bluffing. He's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. Nice try, asshole. (waves his hand) Kill them. HALLENBECK (plowing ahead) Then there's the matter of two million dollars. Or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float...? He once again looks Marcon in the eye. \nHALLENBECK I've got your money, Connie. Stashed in the back of a rented Subaru. We'll take you to it. MARCON (laughing) Jesus, I don't believe it.    This guy's a riot. JIMMY (sotto) I don't think it's working, Joe. Try another one. HALLENBECK Hell, I'm fresh out. You wanna try one, kid, go for it. A pause. Then, without warning, Jimmy turns -- And slugs Hallenbeck with his good arm. Decks him. JIMMY Fuck you, Joe, I'm not just gonna stand here and die. Mr. Marcon, he's lying. We do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker. I have the key on me. I'l hand it over if you let me go. Hallenbeck stares in disbelief. The kid's actually trying something. MARCON Where is the key, Jimmy? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: JIMMY It's stashed in my shorts. MARCON (nods) All right. Slow and easy. JIMMY Sure.   Slow and easy. Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist. We see, but Marcon doesn't: It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist. \nJIMMY Promise you'll let me go. MARCON Hell with that, son. Hand it over or I'll have you kneecapped. JIMMY Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad. See, it's one of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt...? And, with that, he hurls it into the fire. So fast that nobody can see just what he threw. JIMMY I guess nobody gets the money. The two hardguys rush to the fireplace. \nMARCON Pull it out of there! One of them grabs a pair of tongs -- and the SHREDDER EXPLODES. Sprays the two hardguys.    Cuts them to ribbons. Then, several things happen at once: Everybody goes for a gun. Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol -- As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES, missing -- Joe RETURNS FIRE, BAM-BAM -- ! Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile -- (CONTINUED) \n", "test3_id": 578}

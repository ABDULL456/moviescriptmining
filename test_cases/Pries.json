Priest turns to find an OFFICER standing, LASER-GUIDED SHOTGUN pointed at him. The soup kitchen suddenly deathly quiet. \nKOEPPEN (CONT'D) The Church feels it's better to keep you under its care...at least until this trouble with your niece blows over.. \nPRIEST You know I can't do that. \nKOEPPEN That's what I figured. \nTEN TROOPERS IN FULL RIOT GEAR STORM IN Jackboots CLACKING, they form a circle around Priest and Koeppen.

Priest looks around the room -- FAMILIES AND HOMELESS huddle at the surrounding tables, terrified. There's only one thing left for him to do. \nPRIEST Then ...I go against God. In an eyeblink -- Priest strips the gun from the nearby officer, CRACKING it against the trooper's head, his attack graceful and precise -- a whirlwind of PINPOINTED BLOWS and SHATTERED BONES. When it's over, eleven troopers lie on the ground writhing. Everything goes quiet. \nANGLE ON: A LITTLE BOY He breaks, from his father.'' knee, slowly moving towards the window, drawn by a FLICKERING SHADOW. His mouth drops open as -- \nWHAM! -- TWENTY MORE TROOPERS PUNCH through the windows in unison, showering everybody with glass! BULLETS whistle through the air, everyone SCREAMING as they scramble for cover. The father diving for his son. \nPRIEST Folds his hands into the prayer position. VOONI There's a POP OF AIR and --- \nSILENCE The: troopers look around confused -- their guns have disappeared. \nA..., \nON A NEARBY TABLE A neat pile of shotguns sit, every FIRED BULLET collected harmlessly in a clean circle around them ...as if picked out of thin air. \nTHE LITTLE BOY is somehow back with his father, the two safely holding hands, staring stupidly at each other.

He takes a swig. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHURCH - NIGHT \nThe STRIKE of a match -- a prayer candle is lit, glowing in the darkness. \nAT THE ALTAR Priest kneels, eyes clenched shut in prayer.

He races onto the street. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nSheets of rain fall like lead. Pooling in the gutters. \nPRIEST (O.S.) All I can do is ask for forgiveness for what is yet to come... \nThe cycle knifes through the city. Expertly working his way through congested streets. Moving past tent cities, stockyards and rusty industrial machinery. \nEXT. CITY LIMIT - NIGHT \nWe see a MASSIVE WALL -- A hundred feet high, surrounding the city. Priest pulls up to a CHECKPOINT TOWER. A PHALANX OF GUARDS with big shotguns at the ready, snapping into place. Mugs like anvils. \nPRIEST (O.S.) I now know the devil lives within me. The sins coming all too easy... Still on his bike, Priest's foot touches the ground, blocking our view as we CUT TO: \nEXT. CITY LIMIT - MOMENTS LATER \nTHE MASSIVE DOOR/WALL sliding open with a KLANG1 revealing the wasteland. \nPRIEST (0.3.) And all too frequently. Priest REVS his bike, gunning out the doors.

WASTELAND - LATER \nPriest rides past a line of ANCIENT STATUES dominating the landscape, each representing one of the seven deadly sins, sentinels marking the boundary into the deep wasteland. He FLOORS it, the bike PUNCHING for the horizon, a thick plume of dust funneling behind it... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OUTPOST 10 - NIGHT \nIt's quiet, Just the sound of the rusty windmill. The only light provided by the moon reflecting off Priest's cycle, he's just arrived. He crouches, examining,a fresh TIRE TREAD. He stares, taking in the landscap e, feeling it. Then he steps inside the cabin -- \nINT. OUTPOST 10 \nIt looks like a war zone. Splintered furniture everywhere, sprays of dried, black blood over the floorboards. He brushes away rubble and finds a DRESS, Shannon's. Putting his face to it, he inhales, his expression softening. \nBEHIND HIM Quietly, A COWBOY HAT and a SHOTGUN BARREL emerge from a hole in the floor. \nCOWBOY HAT Alright, now -- Not another step. Climbing out from the hole, both barrels pointed, is SHERIFF HICKS (22). You could say the name fits. But you'd only be half right. \nHICKS Thought you'd come back for a souvenir, hub? You gotta be the dumbest bloodsucker I ever come across. Priest steps into a pool of moonlight, illuminating his face. \nPRIEST If I was a vampire you'd be dead already. The cross tattoo, a striking image. Hicks stares, pushing his hat back on his forehead. \nHICKS I'll be dammed.

Insect clicking claws. Black eyes. Fangs. More creature than human. The vampire cackles, sounds like dried paper, its voice a series of teeth clicking hisses. as it eyes Priest angrily. \nLEAD VAMPIRE What are you doing here,. Priest... haven't you already done enough? \nPRIEST We don't want a fight. We're just looking for the girl. The vampire sneers and as it speaks the following -- one by one, the OTHERS drop from the sky, flanking him. They're scraggly, a little undernourished. \nLEAD VAMPIRE Look at us -- Living in ruin, forced to feed off the blood of animals. We once scoured 'this land. We were warriors...we were Gods! \nPRIEST You were murderers. \nLEAD VAMPIRE We were what nature made us.

A vampire swoops towards him, fangs bared, claws ready to rip. \nPRIEST \nLeaps at the creature just in time, driving it to the ground. in one brutal motion he. straddles it, twisting its head at a horrible angle. He turns to Hicks. \nPRIEST (CONT'D) \nFOCUS. And with that he's gone, rolling across the ground like a boulder and LEAPING at TWO DARTING VAMPIRES. \nHICKS Dazed, watches as the vampire's body erupts with death spasms, arms and legs kicking the air in a violent frenzy until finally all life drains away. \nHICKS (under his breath) Jesus. Another VAMPIRE careens towards him. Coming in low, crawling across the ground on all fours. Fangs dripping. Hicks FIRES off a mess of bullets, peppering the creature as it flails backwards screeching. He snaps out the empty shells, reloading almost supernaturally fast, firing off a shot that SPLITS the Vampire's throat. He twirls the gun, flipping it into his holster. This leaves only \nTHE LEAD VAMPIRE Perched atop his crypt like a gargoyle, raging at Priest and Hicks from the depths of hell with at HORRIBLE SHRIEK. In full fury, he LEAPS and flies away, the sounds of his torment echoing throughout the canyon as he vanishes into the night sky. \nHICKS (CONT'D) Should we go after him? \nPRIEST No need. He'll the at first light. Priest goes to the Familiars still lying on the ground. They're sobbing, having lost everything in the world that mattered. Completely wrecked. He grabs one by the scruff of the neck. \n10 PRIEST (CONT'D) No more masters. Just you and me.

Their bodies lock in a horrible struggle, rolling across the Familiars. The Vampire's claws CHURNING into their bodies, killing them instantly. \nTHE VAMPIRE Throws Priest into a crypt, SMASHING him through the wall, flying in after him.

The two are silent, grimly going about their task -- It's obvious the skirmish has affected Hicks. Priest notices. \nPRIEST How's your arm? \nHICKS Lucky I guess. The blade didn't go that deep. (fingering the bandage) Don't know what got into those Familiars to attack like that. They're usually harmless. Priest finds a KNIPE clutched in a dead Familiar's hand, tucks it in his waistband. \nPRIEST Usually. A BEAT as they listen to the popping of the fire. A tension hanging between them. Then - \nHICKS You did this on purpose, didn't you? You knew we wouldn't. be out before sundown. You wanted this to happen. \nPRIEST You don't have the stomach for it --head back to Haibridge right now. Hicks glares at Priest. \nHICKS The stomach I got. I was in the Rangers two years. Even fought in the Boondock Uprising...I saw some crazy things. \nHORRIBLE THINGS \n(SOFTER) I just ain't never seen anything like this. \nPRIEST Killing a vampire isn't like killing a man.

The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider #1's handlebars, the bike SWEEPING into the other, CRASHING in a tangled mess. With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest. These vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe. Stronger, quicker. Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs. \nA BRUTAL FIGHT Spinning, twisting, kicking, gnashing. Bodies locked in deep combat as Priest fends off the ferocious attackers. War cries WHOOPING, the OTHERS TWO RIDERS continue to circle the gladiators, dust kicking from their wheels. \nPRIEST Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers.

Gritting his teeth, he walks between the rows, quiet as possible. The interiors of the coffins are dark, hard to see what's lying inside, just that horrible breathing sound. As Hicks moves past, his body brushes the wood, the space so very tight. WHAM! The train CATCHES the rail and the car shakes, KNOCKING HIM INTO A COFFIN! Jarring it. He stops.

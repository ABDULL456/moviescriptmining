He rises and comes over to the bar. \nWILLARD (continuing) What do you want ? \nCIVILIAN (indicating the Army jeep) If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us. \nWILLARD Whose orders ? \nCAPTAIN Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang. \nWILLARD Who are you ? \nCIVILIAN The agency. \nWillard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks roght out toward the jeep without saying another word. The Civilian follows. \n8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK \nA darkly painted \"HUEY\" ROARS over low paddies and jungle before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily fortified, concealed compound. \nWILLARD (V.O.) They took me to some place outside Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters for all operations in South East Asia. I'd worked for Intelligence before -- \nArmed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground corridor -- they enter. \n9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM \nA door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic maps and filled with smoke. \nThe whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly reclaiming it. \nWILLARD Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir. \nCOLONEL (O.S.) Okay, Willard, sit down. \nWillard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN. \nCOLONEL Have you ever seen this officer before, Captain Willard ? \nHe points to the Major. \nWILLARD No, sir. \nCOLONEL This gentleman or myself ? \nWILLARD No, sir. \nCOLONEL I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ? \nWILLARD I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir. \nMAJOR Very good. \nHe turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map. \nCOLONEL You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ? \nWILLARD I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir. \nThe officer smiles at this. \nCOLONEL Then you can appreciate Command's concern over their -- shall we say 'erratic' methods of operation. (pause) I have never favored elite units, Captain, including your paratroopers or whatever. Just because a man jumps out of an airplane or wears a silly hat doesn't give him any priviliges in my book -- not in this man's army. \nMAJOR We didn't need 'em in Korea -- no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy and an M-1 Garand, none of this fancy crap -- no sir. \nCIVILIAN (stopping him) Major. \nCOLONEL We have Special Forces A detachments all along the Cambodian border. Two here and another one here -- twelve or fourteen Americans -- pretty much on their own; they train and motivate Montagnard natives; pick their own operations. If they need something, they call for it, and get it within reason. What we're concerned with is here. \n10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP \nCOLONEL The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba. It was originally a larger base, built up along the river in an old Cambodian fortress. The area has been relatively quiet for the past two years -- but -- \n11  MED VIEW \nCOLONEL ... Captain, we know something's going on up there -- Major -- \nThe Major looks at some papers in front of him. \nMAJOR Communications naturally dwindled with the lack of V.C. activity, this is routine, expected ... but six months ago communication virtually stopped. \nCOLONEL About the same time -- large numbers of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent began leaving the area -- this in itself is not unusual since these people have fought with the Rhade Tribe that lived in the area for centuries. But what is unusual is that we began to find Rhade refugees too -- in the same sampans as the M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid of V.C. They've put up with war for twenty years -- but something is driving them out. \nMAJOR We communicate with the base infrequently. What they call for are air strikes, immediate -- always at night. And we don't know what or who the air strikes are called on. \nWILLARD Who ? \nMAJOR You see, no one has really gone into this area and come back alive. \nWILLARD Why me ? \nMAJOR Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel, Special Forces. We understand you knew him. \nHe puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand. \nWILLARD Yeah. \nCOLONEL He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba. \nThe Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder, flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military. Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like someone dumb, except very fast. \n", "test1_true": "GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background. \nSECOND VOICE Blue Delta five This Big Rhine -- three Need that ordinance immediately Goddamn give it to me immediate Christ -- Big Rhino -- Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn. \nA heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER -- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words. \nTHIRD VOICE This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta. \nMAJOR That's Colonel Kurtz. \nKURTZ (V.O.) I want that napalm dropped in the trees -- spread it among the branches. \nWe'll give you a flare -- an orange one -- bright orange. (STATIC) We'd also like some white phosporous, Blue Delta. White phosporous, give it to me. \nSTATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off. \nWILLARD I only met Kurtz once. \nCIVILIAN Would he remember you ? \nWILLARD Maybe. \nCOLONEL What was your impression of him ? \nWillard shrugs. \nCIVILIAN You didn't like him. \nWILLARD Anyone got a cigarette. \nThe Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks. \nWILLARD (continuing) I thought he was a lame. \nCOLONEL A lame ? \nWILLARD This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument. \nCOLONEL About what ? \nWILLARD I don't know. He was a lame, that's all. \nCOLONEL But why ? \nWILLARD He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill. \nCOLONEL Well, he's killing now. \nWILLARD Maybe. \nCIVILIAN What does that mean ? \nWILLARD Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it. \nCOLONEL It's got to be Kurtz. \nCIVILIAN The point is that Kurtz or somebody attacked a South Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three days ago. Last week a Recon helicopter was lost in the area -- another took heavy damage -- direct fire from their base camp. \nWILLARD Our Recon flight ? \nCIVILIAN Ours. \nWILLARD Touchy. \nCIVILIAN You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out. \nWILLARD You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet. \nCIVILIAN Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command. \nWILLARD Terminate ? \nCIVILIAN Terminate with extreme prejudice. \n12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA \nA waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms. \nA Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area. This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle- dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet, M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard. \n13  MED.

Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean. \nWILLARD Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise. \nCHIEF All right with me, I used to drive a taxi. \nWILLARD Let's go. \nThe Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard and otherwise go about their work. \nThe twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads to the ocean. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n14  FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA \n", "test1_id": 2736, "test2_input": "WILLARD So?

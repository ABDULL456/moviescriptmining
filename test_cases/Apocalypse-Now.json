{"train": "The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another. \n15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF \nWillard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale. Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just stares ahead into space, swallowing. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n16  LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK \nThe dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds -- the sea is calm again. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST \nThe Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him. \nCHIEF The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out. \nWILLARD We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ? \nCHIEF 'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down. \nWILLARD Shot himself. What for ? \nCHIEF Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ? \nPause, looking at Willard. \n18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD \nSuddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all stand silently -- suddenly it stops. \nWILLARD Arch light. \nCHEF I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens. \nCHIEF Anybody see some smoke ? \nCLEAN Too far inland. \nLANCE There they are. \nHe points up to the sky. \n19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY \nWay up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor trails streaming white against the dark blue sky. \nCLEAN Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not till it's too late -- don't have to hit you neither, concussion'll do it for a quarter mile or better. Burst your ears -- suck the air outta your lungs. \n20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW \nThey are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned. He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He flips through the letters and other documents. \nWILLARD (V.O.) The dossier on A detachment had letters from Kurtz' wife and the wives and families of his men. All asking where to send future mail, understanding the necessery silence due to the nature of their work -- None of the men had written home in half a year. \nOccasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting of the distant B-52 BOMBING. \n21  CLOSE - ON WILLARD \nstudying, examining a report. \n22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ \nKurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his career as represented in the pictures in the dossier, as Willard reads : \nWILLARD (V.O.) Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a dedicated and well-disciplined spirit. He is a fine officer, combining military efficiency -- with a broad background in the Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ... \nAnother picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the 161st Petroleum Supply Group sign. \nWILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... He views his military career as the dedication of his talents to bringing our values and way of life to those darker, less fortunate areas in the world. \nA SHOT of Kurtz at jump school. \nWILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... I feel Captain Kurtz' request for Special Forces training is highly unusual in regard to his past humanitarian concerns, and his somewhat liberal politics, though I can see no reason to deny it. \nA CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam jungle. His face is blank and vacant. \nWILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... We feel Major Kurtz' need to bring a sense of Western culture to the backward peoples of these areas will be of use in accordance with our 'Vietnamization' programs ... \nMOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA \nWILLARD (V.O.) One day later we came to an advanced staging area along the coast. This was our last chance to pick up supplies before approaching the mouth of the Nung River. The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load- ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera- tions \"Brute Force\" and \"Mailed Fist.\" \nEverywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers -- helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds advanced staging areas like the Americans. \nAs the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices something. \nLANCE Hey. \nThey look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water- skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at one another. \n24  VIEW ON THE DOCK \nOthers grab the air in front of them. With each movement their need increases by the square. \n31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN \nThey crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the wire -- the guards in the \"riot control positions\" forget -- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat, which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows, then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below. \nSuch are the ways of war. \nCUT TO: \n32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY \nThe P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline. There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle. \nWILLARD (V.O.) Two days out of Hau Fat, there was nothing but us and the coastline. I felt like I had set off for the center of the earth... \nSuddenly, Chief looks out, ahead. \nCHIEF Smoke ! \nWILLARD Where ? \nThey all turn. Chief points up the coast. \n33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE \nA thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle. \nWILLARD Black smoke ... secondary burning. \nThe Chief grabs field glasses. \nCHIEF Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em. \nWILLARD First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River. \n34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE \nA vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts -- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the surf. \n35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW \nThey wade through the water to the beach where they are met by a heavily armed group of men. \nOverhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men. \nWe can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it. \n36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS \nThree Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out- side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall, strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE -- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache. \nHe crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle. His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses. \nKILGORE (bellowing) Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line back about a hundred yards -- give me some room to breathe. \nA Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off. \n37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD \nHe was not quite prepared for this. \n38  VIEW ON KILGORE \nturning to his GUARDS \nKILGORE Bring me some cards. \nGUARD Sir ? \nKILGORE Body cards, you damn fool -- cards ! \nThe soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance. \nWILLARD (formally) Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission. \nKILGORE (not looking up) Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain. \nHe cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The others follow, \n39  TRACKING VIEW \nThe Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on it -- carefully picking out which card he uses. \nKILGORE (to himself) Six a spades -- eight a hearts -- Isn't one worth a Jack in this whole place. \nThe Colonel goes on about this business. \n40  TRACKING ON KILGORE \nmoving through the corpses, dropping the cards. \nOn of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers something to him. He stops. \nKILGORE What ? Here. You sure? \nThe soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t Willard. \nKILGORE (continuing) What's your name, sailor ? \nKILGORE Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line. \n65  FULL SHOT - JET SQUADRON \nFour F-4H Phantoms peel off and streak toward the coast. \n66  INT. COMMAND COPTER - VIEW ON WILLARD AND KILGORE \nKILGORE Fucking savages. WILLARD Who? KILGORE The enemy. Who else? \n67  HELICOPTER'S POV - THE JETS \nThe jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange napalm along the trees. \nKILGORE (O.S.) (on radio) Very good, Hell's Angels -- suggest you follow with cannon fire. \n68  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT \nThey circle the battle. \nRADIO (V.O.) This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left. \nKILGORE Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you. \nHe turns to door gunner. \nKILGORE (continuing) Right along the doors, boy. \nThe gunner FIRES leaning out -- \nKILGORE (continuing) Fine... fine... little higher. Through the roof; yeah, that's good. \nHe leans back in. \nKILGORE (continuing) Didn't anybody bring me any bombs, grenades, claymores or anything? \nLIEUTENANT You didn't tell me to, sir. \nKILGORE (grumbling) You shoulda known. \nSuddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore is thrown down where he hangs on. \nKILGORE (continuing) Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt? \nWILLARD Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's. \nKILGORE The trees, eh... \nHe grabs the R.T. \nKILGORE (continuing) Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees. \nRADIO (V.O.) Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left. \nKILGORE Take her in low, Lieutenant. \n69  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS \nThe two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS. \nOther copters join -- The V.C. break and run through the rice paddies in the f.g. -- BULLETS EXPLODING around them -- they scream and fall FIRING back. \n70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD \nKilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third. \nKILGORE Hold it, boy. \nHe puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings back inside. \nKILGORE (continuing) Take her up to 300 feet, Lieutenant. \nThey rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's harness. \nKILGORE (continuing) Rifle. \nA hand passes him a M-16. \nKILGORE (continuing; hard) My rifle, soldier. \nThere is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300 Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and opens the bolt. \n71  VIEW ON WILLARD \nAmazed at these proceedings. \n72  VIEW ON KILGORE \nas he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets into the sling and slams the bolt shut. \n73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C. \nHe is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud. The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol. \n74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD \nKilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy. Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back into the copter. \n75  VIEW ON WILLARD \nThey walk through shallows carrying brightly colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by carrying out wounded. \nThey wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned on the boards along the word \"Airmobile\". They edge into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak. \n82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS \nThey paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the beautiful waves breaking beyond them. \n83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE \nThey paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing hard and constantly looking around scared out of their minds. \n84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE \nKilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole. \nKILGORE They far enough? \nLANCE Sure -- fine -- \nKilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from a waiting lackey. \nKILGORE (through megaphone) That's far enough -- pick one up and come on in -- \n85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS \nThey line themselves up on the point. A good set is building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off -- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking around frantically. \n86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE \nAnother SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach. Lance looks over at Willard. \nLANCE (to himself) Maybe he'll get tubed. \nWILLARD What? \nLANCE Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him. \nA SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in. WILLARD Incoming ! \nLance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water are HEARD. \nKILGORE Son of a bitch. \nLance looks up and out toward the point in horror. \n87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT \nTwo surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down on the waves. \n88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE \nLANCE (to himself) The tragedy of this war is a dead surfer. \nWillard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy, too. \nWILLARD What's that? \nLANCE Just something I read in the Free Press. \nKILGORE They just missed a good set -- the chicken shits ! \nLance looks up. \n89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS \nThey come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke hangs over the water. \nKILGORE (O.S.) (megaphone) Try it again, you little bastards. \n90  BACK TO SCENE \nHe turns to Willard. \nKILGORE (continuing) I\u00b4m not afraid to surf this place. I'll surf this place. \n91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE \nHe turns, glowering to his lackeys. \nKILGORE Bring that R.T., soldier. \nHe grabs it. \nKILGORE (continuing) Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels -- Goddamit, I want that treeline bombed -- yeah -- napalm -- gimme some napalm -- son of a bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z. or C.B.U.'s if you got any of them -- just bomb 'em into the Stone Age, boy. \nHe throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO WHISTLES over -- everyone drops. \nKILGORE (continuing; to himself) Son of a bitch. \nAs the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un- intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his rifle turning to Lance -- \nKILGORE (continuing) We'll have this place cleaned up and ready for us in a jiffy, boy. Don't you worry. \nHe FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead. \n92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS \nA sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us -- The P.B.R. hangs below it. \nThe P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and crew waiting and yelling. \n99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE \nWILLARD Are you finished surfing? \nLANCE Yeah... thanks. \nWILLARD Want to say goodbye to the Colonel? \nLANCE Nah. \nWILLARD Then let's get the hell out of here. \nThey break and run like hell toward the boat in the distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some- thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards -- Willard looks at them. \nLANCE No -- no, Captain. \nWILLARD Which one's the Colonel's? \nLANCE The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer. \nWillard glances over to it with determination. There is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it. \nCHIEF (O.S.) Incoming ! Incoming -- son of a bitch. \nThe ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand. Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the board. \nWILLARD (calm) This one , Lance? \nLANCE Yeah, Jesus Christ ! \nOnce again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat, through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr. Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and relieved. \nCLEAN What'd you that for? \nWILLARD When I was a kid I, never had a Yater spoon. \nMr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount. The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF toward the deeper water of the river -- the board clearly visible on the stern. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R \nThe P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed. It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy fire. \n101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW \nThey all are in full battle positions -- their twin fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready. Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back from his forward turret. \nLANCE (yelling) Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater. \nWILLARD He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down. \nThey all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst. \nWILLARD (continuing) Let's put some distance between us and Charlie. \nThe Chief nods. \nCHIEF Lance --- LANCE Yeah. \nCHIEF Why don't you roll us a big joint? I think the Captain'd like that. \nThey all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful pause, Willard smiles: \nWILLARD Take one a mine -- \nHe fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights up. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R. \nIt zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT \nThe boat is hidden under some trees along the river bank. The men wait tensely listening -- \nLANCE You hear it again? \nWILLARD No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back. \nLANCE You think he'd of shot us? \nWILLARD When? \nLANCE Any time -- us -- Americans. \nLance looks over at Willard. \nWILLARD I don't think he\u00b4d of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board -- \nLANCE A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here. \nWILLARD He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants. \nThe Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night. \nLANCE What's this tiger shit? \nWILLARD No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him. \nLANCE You think? \nWILLARD I wasn\u00b4t looking.. I was running. \nCLEAN Was a big tiger -- no shit? \nWILLARD Who stopped to measure him -- let's get the hell out of here. \nCHEF A motherfucking tiger -- I could've been killed. \nThe ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great speed. \nCHIEF You forgot the mangoes, didn't you? \nCHEF Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat. \nThey move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle. \nWILLARD (V.O.) He was right, the Chef -- never go into the jungle, unless you're ready to go all the way. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n108  EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT \nWillard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns around, and we SEE his face. \nWILLARD (V.O.) What was in the jungle? What was there, waiting for me? \nHe lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating his face momentarily. There is something different about him; a maturity, a cool inner peace. \nWILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... Kurtz was in there. Or was he; was it Kurtz? He was just a name to me now; I couldn't remember a face, a voice -- he just didn't add up to me. all his liberal bullshit about the end of savagery -- and the role of our culture, our way of life... \nWillard looks toward the group of people on the boat -- there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh. \nWILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) Our way of life -- I really started to look forward to meeting Kurtz again. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n109  WATERWAY - MOVING FORWARD - DAY \nWe HEAR: \nRADIO -- must remember that we owe our thanks for these to the wonderful services of the U.S.O. -- here's another oldie -- this one dedicated... \n110  VIEW ON CHEF \nby himself on the P.B.R.; he has wiped mud under his eyes to kill the glare; it is incredibly hot. He is barechested, wearing a hat made of a banana palm. \nRADIO ... to the fire team at An Khe from their groovy C.O. Fred the Head -- \n111  VIEW ON THE GROUP \nRADIO The Rolling Stones and \"Satisfaction...\" \nCHEF Outa sight. \nThe SONG BLARES ON -- they all dig it. \nPAN TO Willard, sitting alone in the rear, reading from his file on Kurtz. We REVEAL Lance in the b.g., water- skiing behind the P.B.R., slaloming back and forth on his single ski to the MUSIC -- jumping the wake occasion- ally. \n112  NEW VIEW - ON THE P.B.R. \nLance waterskiing to \"Satisfaction.\" \n113  VIEW ON CLEAN \nalert, at the rear of the boat -- his M-16 ready, just in case. \n114  VIEW ON WILLARD \nWillard opens a letter from the packet. \nWe can SEE it is a private correspondence -- feminine writing on the envelope. \nWILLARD (V.O.) The dossier of A Dtachment contained letters from the families and wives of Kurtz' men There were letters from Kurtz' wife as well. \n115  CLOSE SHOT - ON THE LETTER \nIt is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner is the return addess of Mrs. Colonel Walter Kurtz -- Willard's hand fushes through the packet and comes up with apicture of a very attractive, thirty-five year old American Beauty... She is classically American. \n116  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD looking at the picture -- puts it back, then opens the letter, straightens it. WILLARD (V.O.) Dearest Walt -- I have to confess something. I know how you feel about this, but I had to ask Bob to find out what he could -- I just couldn't stand it anymore, not knowing where you are, whether you're alive or dead. I'm sorry Walt, I'm sorry I said that. Bob didn't tell me anything -- he said he couldn't -- I can't stand it anymore, Walt -- I just can't stand it. \nWillard looks out at the jungle. \nDeep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests pass by. The Rolling Stones CHANT on in the b.g. \nWILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) I have to take the kids to school every morning now -- carpools just never work out. \nJeff came home with a black eye on Tuesday but said he won anyway. He wouldn't tell me what the fight was about. Jeff keeps asking where you are -- he has maps of Viet Nam in his room now. He misses you very much. I can't take this much longer, Walt. I love you and I just can't stand it. \n117  CLOSE ON WILLARD \nHe folds the letter up, files through some others quickly and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic- ular. It reads: \nTERRI Do us a favor -- I'd do one for you -- if I could -- \nWillard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others. \nAGENT Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life. \nWILLARD I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes -- \nAGENT Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell -- \nWILLARD I like all of them -- \nAGENT Good -- like I said, take your pick. \nWILLARD I said I like all of them. \nAGENT Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull? \nWillard turns to leave again. \nWILLARD We need all our fuel anyway. \nAGENT Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that -- \nWILLARD Sit down -- we'll talk about it. \nWillard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent to do likewise. \nAGENT What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me. \nWILLARD My men -- \nAGENT What ! \nWILLARD That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men -- \nThe girls are trying to pretend they're not listening -- the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself. \nAGENT You're out of your skull -- \nWILLARD We have a lot of pride in our unit -- \nAGENT How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think -- \nWILLARD Esprit de corps -- AGENT No -- absolutely not -- \nWILLARD One for all -- all for one -- \nAGENT You can keep your fucking fuel -- \nWillard gets up. \nWILLARD You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together. \nAGENT Get out -- \nWILLARD Men of all races -- nationalities -- \nHe gets up and starts out. \nAGENT Two drums -- \nWillard turns around slowly. \nAGENT (continuing) Two whole drums -- \nWILLARD We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too -- \nAGENT I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked -- \nWILLARD I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em -- \nHe turns to go under the tent flap. \nWILLARD (continuing) Have the girls freshen up a bit -- comb their hair -- put on something -- you know what I mean -- \nHe leaves. \n123  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW \nThey are all working on patching the boat and cleaning it up in general. Mr. Clean sits in f.g., cleaning an M-16. \nCLEAN You keep this thing in this condition an' it's gonna jam, Lance -- mark my words. \nLANCE Why don't you go pet the water buffaloes -- get off my back. \nBehins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes eating mud or whatever they do. They are painted jungle brown and green camouflage with grey bottoms -- on their sides the words have been stenciled in black: 1 Each -- Buffalo, Water B-1A U.S. Army No. 15239 \nWillard walks through them down to the boat. \nCHIEF Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge. \nWILLARD All right I got a little surprise for you -- \nThey all look up. \nWILLARD (continuing) I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel -- \nCHEF No shit. \nLIEUTENANT I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard -- \nWILLARD What is this bridge? \nLIEUTENANT It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded. \nHe points to the men getting ready to work. \nLIEUTENANT (continuing) Every night we build it and by 0800 they've blown it up -- it and a lot of good men -- But the generals like to say the road is open -- ha ! Nobody uses that road except Charlie. \nHe turns and splashes off into the darkness. \nLIEUTENANT (continuing) This is the cesspool of hell. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) Incoming. \nSHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous. \nCHIEF (yelling) All right -- Lance, go with the Captain an' see what you can scrounge -- \nWillard climbs out with Lance. \nCHIEF (continuing; to Willard) Better make it fast, sir -- we don't really need much anyway. \nWillard nods and they scurry off the bank under the bridge. \n129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE \nThey dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they don't know where to run. \nVOICE Straight ahead, son of a bitch. \nThey dive towards the voice. \n130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH \nThey dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his buddy who is crying uncontrollably. \nSOLDIER You came right to it, son of a bitch -- \nWILLARD Son of a bitch, sir. \nThe Soldier doesn't respond. \nWILLARD (continuing) Where's your chief supply officer? \nSOLDIER Beverly Hills -- \nWILLARD What? \nSOLDIER Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be? \nWILLARD C'mon -- \nThere is an apparent lull and they dash out along the road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP from a sandbagged emplacement. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) Get your asses down, buddy. \nThey drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner. Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard trips. \nVOICE Watch your feet, asshole -- \nWillard looks down. \nVOICE (continuing) You stepped on my face. \nLANCE We thought you were dead. \nVOICE The whole world loves a smart ass. \nThey move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to himself. \nWILLARD What're you shooting at, soldier? \nGUNNER Gooks. \nHe turns and sees it's an officer. \nGUNNER (continuing) I\u00b4m sorry, sir. \nWILLARD It's all right, sergeant -- what's out there? \nGUNNER They were tryin' to cut through the wire -- I got 'em all I think. \nOTHER SOLDIER Oh yeah -- listen. \nThere is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it stops for aminute then continues hideously. \nGUNNER He's trying to call his friends -- send up a flare. \nThe Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST. \nSPOTTER Those are all dead, stupid, he's obviously underneath 'em -- \nThey think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING gets more intense. \nGUNNER Wake up the Roach. \nThe Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are the words: \"GOD BLESS DOW.\" \nThe river is moving fast against them. all manner of de- bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R. \nCHIEF (to Willard) I can't see a fucking thing. \nThere is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard climbs forward, and looks down. \nCHIEF (continuing) We hit a big enough one this hull will shatter like a Corvette. Fucking plastic boat. \nWillard practically hangs off forward with a long pole, warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean joins him, helping. \nWILLARD (shouting to Chief) What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down? \nCHIEF Who knows what's up there? \nWILLARD Can't be any worse than this. What do you think? \nCHIEF I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse. \nWillard points his pole in the direction of the mouth of a tributary. \nWILLARD Well, get in there. \nCHIEF This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes. \nThere is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks. \nWILLARD Get in there ! \nCHIEF This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party. \nWILLARD Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river. \nIt's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't do as he says. \nCHIEF (finally relents, turns the helm) You're fucking crazy. You're going to get us all killed. \nThe P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth of the tributary. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n136  EXT. THE TRIBUTARY - P.B.R. - RAIN \nRain is pouring down, but the P.B.R. is slowed down to a snail's pace by Hyacinths, literally across the waterway. \nWillard, Chef and Clean in the water, cutting through them with machetes. \n137  VIEW ON LANCE \nhaving climbed to the highest point of the cockpit. \nLANCE It breaks through in about twenty feet. \n138  VIEW ON WILLARD \ncutting through. he looks to Chef, who has stopped cut- ting, and is staring into the jungle. \nWILLARD What do you see? \nCHEF I don't know. \nHe looks out -- the jungle at this point is very dark and high -- totally impenetrable. \nWILLARD Keep cutting. \nThey work feverishly, knowing something is wrong. \n139  VIEW ON CHEF \ncutting with all he's got. \nCHEF I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us. \nWILLARD Probably is. \nCHEF Whatdoya think it thinks. \nWILLARD That we're dumber than we look. \nChef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them. It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later. \nOther BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon. \nCHIEF Lance -- 'bout twenty meters starboard. \nLance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free. \nCHEF There in the trees ! \nEverything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD of heavy BULLETS ripping inti the P.B.R.'s fibreglass hull. \n140  VIEW ON LANCE \nLance's twin guns return the FIRE. The Chief moves to one of the heavy guns and joins Lance in returning the FIRE. \n141  VIEW ON THE MEN IN THE WATER \npushing, cutting. Bullets SMASH and EXPLODE around. Clean climbs onto the boat, and leaps onto a gun emplace- ment. \n142  MED. VIEW \nWILLARD (continuing) That's a light down there -- \nCHEF Yeah, it is. \nCHIEF What the hell is it? \nWILLARD In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light. \n153  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R. - THE TWILIGHT \nThe P.B.R. approaches the distant light -- which seems to be on the dock of an overgrown plantation building. \n154  VIEW ON WILLARD, CHIEF \nstraining to see; he uses field glasses. \n155  POV - THROUGH THE GLASSES \nSeems to be some figures standing on the dock. The figures pull back behind some drums. \n156  BACK TO SCENE \nWILLARD Watch it ! \nThey duck as SHOTS RING OUT from the dock, stitching the water across the P.B.R.'s bow. The crew crouches, guns trained on the dock as the boat still approaches. \nWILLARD (continuing) They're not Cong. \nCHIEF (over the loud-hailer) We're Americans. \nAnother BURST, closer. \nCHEF Maybe you shouldn't say we're Americans? \nWillard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure it out. \nWILLARD Chef, try your French. \nChief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts: \nCHEF Nous sommes Americains -- \nSilence. \nCHEF (continuing) Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser. \n157  VIEW ON WILLARD \nHe looks through the glasses. \n158  POV THROUGH THE GLASSES \nGradually, a small group appears from behind the drums on the dock. \nWILLARD (O.S.) French Nationals -- they may not be too friendly, though. \n159  BACK TO SCENE \nWe drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying speaking French. \nCHEF Nous sommes Americains -- nous sommes des amis -- \nThere is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then: \nFRENCHMAN (shouting out) Vous parlez Francais comme une vache espanole. \nCHEF (to himself) I thought it was pretty good, myself. \nCHIEF What'd he say? \nCHEF Said I speak French like a Spanish cow. \nFRENCHMAN (O.S.) Laisser tomber vos armes -- \nCHEF Put the guns straight up -- stand away from the mounts. \nWILLARD Do it. \nThey do. \nFRENCHMAN (O.S.) Vous pouvez approcher mais doucement -- \nCHEF Take her in slow. \n160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK \nThe men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para- troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear- ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle- aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli- cate, with a strength about him. \nPHILIPPE Hands on the heads. \nCHIEF I can't steer with my goddamn feet. \nCHEF Hey, they speak American. \nGASTON Who is the commanding officer? \nCHIEF I -- \nWILLARD I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold. \n165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING \nA foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted. Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy, caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened, reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him. \nCHEF A hot shower, hot damn. \nHe pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a shower is. \n166  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - EVENING \nbattered and torn -- a few of Philippe's Vietnamese guard at the boat. \n167  INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING \nA beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still elegantly furnished, although old and decaying. \nWillard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and burns. \nHe rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above which is a large mirror. There is an album on the marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random. \n168  VIEW ON WILLARD \nhaggard, looking down at the album. \nWILLARD (V.O.) I wondered -- how long has this room been like this; how long has the furniture been standing in these places? \n169  VIEW ON THE ALBUM \nSome old photographs of people standing around a car in the 20's in front of the plantation. Another picture shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the plantation. \nWILLARD (V.O.) Was it like this sixty years ago? Eighty years? But here, even eighty years is nothing. \nHe turns the page, \nThe plantation being built. Pictures of the framing, skeletal against the sky and jungle. \n170  VIEW ON WILLARD \nfascinated \nWILLARD (V.O.) It was jungle, once; and it will be jungle, again... \n171  VIEW ON THE ALBUM \nOnlu the very beginnings of the house; the first struc- tures. Then another picture of the jungle site where it was to be built. \n172  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD \nHe looks up and sees his own face, reflected in the garish mirror. He barely recognizes himself. \n173  MED. VIEW \nWillard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out- of-time room. \n174  INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT \nTRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food. The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group. The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights up as he regards the wonderful European-style food. \nCHEF This food is wonderful ! I can't believe the chef is a slope. (turning to Clean) Some more? \nOpposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands. \nCHEF (continuing) Hey -- Lance. \nLANCE Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya .. wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni, please. \nAnd then he looks to his friends for approval. \nOur VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain there is another, more elaborate table, where the De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the group. \nThe men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room. Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair next to him. \nGASTON Roxanne, I hope you are feeling better. \nROXANNE Je vais bien maintenant. \nGASTON May I present Captain Willard? He is of a paratroop regiment. You know the difference between a paratrooper and a regular soldier, don't you , my dear? \nROXANNE (smiling and taking Willard's hand) Yes, they come from the sky. \nShe sits -- there's an uneasy silence. \nWillard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne. \nWILLARD I would like to know more about the .. uh, plaque... \nPhilippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted wooden plaque with various tallies on it. \nGASTON Attacks repulsed, as I was saying. (hard) This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise. (pause) Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain. \nWILLARD Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here. \nGASTON Captain? \nWILLARD You'll get blown outta here some day. \nGASTON We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that. \nWILLARD The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too. \nROXANNE (from the sitting room) Are you warm, Captain? \nWILLARD The river is beautiful. \nIn fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat. \n177  WILLARD'S POV. \nThe P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's Vietnamese. \n176  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE \nShe, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes up behind him. \nROXANNE I spend hours watching that river from my bedroom window. It fascinates me. \nShe moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is kissing her. \n179  CLOSE ON WILLARD, ROXANNE \nOne eye steals another look at the P.B.R. \n180  VIEW ON THE P.B.R. \nTwo of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready for the long night. \n181  VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE - ON THE TERRACE \nHis hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting room, and up the stairs. \n182  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW \nIt is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire -- there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one. He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and stands there facing him. \nHe puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays down on the bed and watches him. \nROXANNE I have been lonely here, Captain. \nHe moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is leaning against the wall in his reach. \nFADE OUT. \n183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT \nWe can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure kneeling in final preparations for going out in the night. \nWithout a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing into the darkness. \n184  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT \nTwo Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first, the first disappears into the thicket. \n185  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD \nin the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently, he drags the body out of sight. \n186  MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R. \nThe dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears into the hold. \n187  NEW VIEW \nHe lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly, with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his best work alone, and at night. \nCUT TO. \n188  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING \nHe sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles. \nROXANNE I will fix you breakfast. \nHe starts to get up. \nWILLARD I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta -- \nROXANNE Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order. \nHe stops -- seemingly stunned. \nWILLARD So that's it. \nROXANNE You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much. \nShe turns to go. \nWILLARD What if I say no. \nROXANNE Then Philippe will have to kill all of you. \nShe leaves. \n189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS \nHe walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring ammunition boxes. \nGaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the Chief and crew with M-16's. \nGASTON Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions. \nCHIEF Signs? \nWILLARD Yeah -- like keep out -- \nWillard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead past the smoking mound. \n198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY \nThe P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast. \nWILLARD (V.O.) Toward the night of the fifth day out of Do Lung Bridge, we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz' base. Everything was still, the trees, the creepers, even the brush seemed like it had been changed into some kind of stone. It was unnatural, like a trance. Not a sound could be heard. I began to think I was deaf -- then the fog came suddenly, and I was blind too. \nThe boat disappears in the thick fog. \n199  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD \nWe catch glimpses of him, even though we are close. \nWILLARD Listen. \nCHIEF What is it? \nWILLARD Listen. \nThey are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND COMING FROM THE BANKS. The GROANING, OR WAILING .. of HUNDREDS OF MEN. \nCHIEF They're on the banks of the river. \n200  VIEW ON LANCE \nFrantically, he swings the twin fifties around. \nLANCE Jesus ! \n201  VIEW ON CHIEF \nWe can barely SEE him -- in and out of the fog. \nCHIEF No, Lance. Not while you can't see. \n202  VIEW ON WILLARD \nlistening. The SOUND IS TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING. \nCHIEF Will they attack? \nWILLARD If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore. \nCHEF God... \nLANCE Sounds like hundreds of them. \nWILLARD Shhhhhh. \nThe CHORUS OF GROANS in unbearable. But it is not ahostile cahnt; or a war chant, but rather the SOUND OF HUMAN ANGUISH. \nWILLARD (continuing) It doesn't sound hostile -- it sounds like they've seen us coming and it sounds like -- I don't know, a funeral. I don't understand. \n203  VIEW ON LANCE \nA glimpse of him, almost in tears. We then SEE glimpses, fog moving, of all the men on the P.B.R. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n204  MED. VIEW - THE P.B.R. \nMOVING THROUGH the thinning mist. The Navy craft proceeds cautiously. \nWILLARD (V.O.) Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river. \nCHIEF Which way? Right or left? \nWILLARD Who knows? Right. \nCHIEF Looks pretty shallow. \nThe P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef takes a long pole and begins sounding depth. \n205  VIEW ON WILLARD \nThe men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from bank to bank. Chief keeps his fingers on an M-16. Willard takes out the TOP SECRET packet he received at Do Lung. Tears it open. We MOVE IN ON him. \nWILLARD (reading) Upon reaching objective. Target key personnel and commence operation. Should difficulty arise from which extraction is impossible, break radio silence Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm -- indicate purgative air strike -- code -- Street Gang. (pause) Purgative air strike ! Purgative ! They'd kill me too ! \nSuddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow. Hundreds and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the P.B.R. rattling against the boat. \nCHIEF Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're shooting fucking arrows at us. \n206  CLOSE ON WILLARD \nlooking toward the banks. \n207  WILLARD'S POV \nFrags of men -- naked limbs, arms, breasts, glaring eyes entangled in the dense jungle gloom. And hundreds of pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them. \n208 VIEW ON THE P.B.R. \ncrazily zig-zagging up the river in the midst of the childish assault. \n225  VIEW ON THE P.B.R. \nWillard shouts out to the starnge greeter. \nWILLARD We've been attacked. \nAUSTRALIAN (shouting back) I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right. \nWillard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding them safely in. \nA thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub- merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the ground. Chef nods at the bodies. \nCHEF Charlie? \nWILLARD Looks that way. \nCHEF (looking at the Australian) Who's he? \nWILLARD God knows. \nThe boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat- tered with mud and blood. \nWILLARD (continuing) Who the hell are you? \nAUSTRALIAN Moonby. Got any Winstons? \nWILLARD Moonby what? \nAUSTRALIAN Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted. \nWILLARD (incredulously, indicating the hundreds of natives) What is this? \nMOONBY Oh, they're simple enough people. It's good to see you, baby. Nobody has any Winstons? \nChef automatically offers Moonby a Winston. \nMOONBY This boat's a mess. \nWILLARD Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him. \nMOONBY Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz. (he puffs, then smiles) You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy. \nWILLARD Why did they attack us? \nMOONBY Simple. They don't want him to go. \nWILLARD You're Australian? \nMOONBY Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'. \nWILLARD (almost to himself) So Kurtz is alive. \nMOONBY Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind. \nHe opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his mind's expansion. \nMOONBY (continuing) But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.' \nWILLARD Why didn't he shoot you? \nMOONBY I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too. \nCHEF Love? \nMOONBY Oh, no, not what you think... Cosmic love. He made me see things -- things, you know. \nThe whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress. \n226  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES \nMen in small groups, huddled over food. Now he settles on the entrance in the temple. There are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible shrunken heads. \n227  BACK TO SCENE \nWILLARD Sounds like he's gone crazy. \nMOONBY No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy. \nWILLARD Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads. \nMOONBY Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels... \nWILLARD (to his men) We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance. \nLANCE What? \nWILLARD Bring your rifles, that's all. (looking at Moonby) Take us to him. \nMOONBY Right on -- he's been waiting for -- \nWILLARD And shut up. \nMoonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard and the men follow. \n228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW \nAs they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear where a moment before there was only jungle. \nThey are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is, if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort, where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more primitive and more savage than any since the time of Captain Cook. \nThere is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other. Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin. \nWILLARD Do you know me? \nKURTZ Yes. \nKurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another word or gesture, shoots and kills a man. \nKURTZ (continuing) Do you know me ? \nHe throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful distance behind. Even Willard is stunned. \nCHEF Holy shit. \n237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT \nDotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like a primitive civilization. \n238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL \nWillard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall next to him. He is exhausted. \nLance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef approaches, crouches down. \nCHEF Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time. \nWILLARD I know. \nLance stirs; starts to wake up. \nCHEF What are we doing here? \nWILLARD Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said. \nKURTZ Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts -- \nWILLARD Yeah. \nCHEF He killed that guy without feeling anything. \nWILLARD Not a thing. \nCHEF When you kill Cong, don't you feel something. \nWILLARD Sure. (thinking) Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle. \nWillard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened. \n239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE \nWillard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar emplacement. \nWild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow to Willard as he passes. \nWILLARD This is good -- triple overlapping fields of fire -- walls so thick ordinary artillery just cleans the moss off their surfaces. \nA woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then runs off to her bunker. \nWE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on a big piece of almost raw meat. \nWILLARD (continuing) I've done things, when I was alone in the jungle -- that I never told anyone about. \nThey continue past amount where the shattered wreck of half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of fire into the jungle beyond. \nSome Americans, barely recognizible because of their beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with bayonets. \nCHEF This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here. \nWILLARD Yeah, I know. \nCHEF I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America ! \nWILLARD (lost in his thoughts) ... he's an amazing officer. \nCHEF You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don'\u00b4t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick. \nLance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of nods, sucking a joint. \nWILLARD Yeah. I know. \nHe thinks. \n240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT \nVIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting. \n241  WILLARD'S VIEW \nAn austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head- quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards, but have now fallen into decayed disuse. \nThere are other indications of the modern headquarters this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor- tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair. There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging fromm \"Viet Nam, love it or leave it\" to quotes of Nietzsche \"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted.\" \nMoonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to Willard. \nMOONBY He's asleep -- don't bother him. \nKURTZ I'm awake. \nWillard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby. \nWILLARD How did we get here? \nKURTZ Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie. \nWILLARD I think think a lie stinks. \nKURTZ Oh Captain, that is so true. \nWILLARD Stinks. I could never figure -- (he drinks from the canteen) I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes. \nWillard drinks more of the LSD water. \nKURTZ (angrily) You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense. \nWILLARD Fuck no. \nKURTZ I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want. \nWILLARD We'll exterminate the fuckers ! \nChef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified. He draws his bayonet. \nCHEF Captain -- kill him. \nKURTZ Think of it -- for years, millions of years, savages with pathetic painted faces were scared shitless that fire would rain down from the sky. And goddamn, we made it happen. God  bless  Dow  ! \nCHEF Kill him ! \nChef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively, Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets. \n246  VIEW ON LANCE \nHe has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort of mindless, programmed killer. \nLANCE (FIRING) Hot damn ! \nThen hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an instant of silence, then: \n247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT \nThe DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming, as illuminating flares light up the blackness. \n248  MED. CLOSE VIEW \nof enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted out to the enemy, poised to attack. \n249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER \nCannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay- onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish in water pipes. One looks up to the sky. \n250  EIS VIEW \nA rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche- delic hallucination. \n251  VIEW ON THE SOLDIER \nSOLDIER Wow... \nAnother behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t himself. \n252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE \nWillard strides out of the darkness, into the positions around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior -- Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans, even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow, salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and purple. \nWe SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of teeth around his neck, his face painted. \n253  FULL VIEW - MONTAGE \nEnemy ARTILLERY BLASTING away at the fortress. \n254  CLOSE SHOT - A MORTAR \nA hand drops a shell and it FIRES. \n255  CLOSE SHOT - ROCKET LAUNCHER \nIt FIRES. EXPLOSIONS around the fort, red and orange and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some sort of cosmic flower. \n256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK) \nShoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a death ray gun, radiating outward with ice-blue energy. \n257  SHOT ON LOUDSPEAKERS \nblasting out music. \n258  MED. CLOSE VIEW ON YOUNG SOLDIERS \nWith the MUSIC, like those people you see listening to radios in their cars. \n259  SHOT ON THE COMMAND BUNKER - WILLARD , KURTZ , OTHERS \n(In SLOW MOTION) Shells WHISTLE in and EXPLODE on the walls in the compound. The men behind them are setting up rocket launcher (missile) . Everywhere metal and rock and flame fly and it is beautiful to see. \nWillard looks through the infra-red sniper scope. \n260  WILLARD - INFRA-RED POV \nStrange, luminescent images of North Vietnamese approach- ing the outer perimeters. Thousands of them. \nKURTZ I was on threshold of great things. \nWillard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck, holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The spectacle continues in the b.g. \n277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER \nThis wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages to get him onto the boat. \n278  EXTREME FULL SHOT \nThe spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of Nu Mung Ba. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN. \n279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING \nThe entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and some Montagnards sit near them. \nTheir eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something. Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the f.g. below is Lance, dead. \nColby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair. \nCOLBY Who is he? \nWILLARD He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war. \nCUT TO: \n280  THE P.B.R. \nbattered, moving slowly down the river. \n281  TIGHTER VIEW \nColby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious. Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks. Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air. Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him. The battle is not over. \nKURTZ Don't. Don't frighten them away. \nWillard looks down at him. \nWILLARD So you understand this? \nKurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his eyes. There is a slight smile. \nKURTZ Do I not? \n282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW \nThe boat moves as though naturally carried by the river. \nKURTZ My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife... (he looks at Willard) ... my death. \nWILLARD You had immense plans... immense plans... \nKURTZ Yes... \nWILLARD I'm taking you back. \nKurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry that is no more than a breath. \nKURTZ The horror, the horror. \nWe HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching. The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up, craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points. \nCOLBY There. \nOver the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC helicopters hooping toward them. \nCOLBY (continuing) How did they know? \nWILLARD They must have seen the fire. \nThe helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US. \nCOLBY They're coming to rescue us. They're Medevac. \n283  CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD \nHe stares up at the sky. \nWILLARD (to himself) They're coming to take us back. \nCopters directly overhead. \nWILLARD (continuing) Yeah. \nCOLBY Colonel Kurtz, he's dead. \nWILLARD Yeah. \nHe raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap- proaching rescue helicopter. \n284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER \nIt frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the sky. \n285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY \n", "test1_input": "TITLE \nA P O C A L Y P S E   N O W \nOriginal screenplay by John Milius. \nInspired by Joseph Conrad's \"HEART OF DARKNESS\". \nThis draft by Francis Ford Coppola. \nDecember 3, 1975. \n1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN \nIt is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago. \nOur VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface; then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: \"Gook Killer.\" The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely. \nOur VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance. We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears. As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted in a paisley design. \nNow the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes. ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW. Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching. \nThe VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out with AUTOMATIC FIRE. \nOut VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn, screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed. Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved; they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else. They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns. They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US as they move. \nThe soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE. \nWe begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him, only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is frightened. \nAn AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the dead. \nOUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame, bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud, electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK : \nMAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW \n2  TITLE SEQUENCE \nThe CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying; transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely look at, like the sun itself. \nThen it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more distant. The TITLES CONTINUE. \nWe are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the MUSIC  now. \nWe MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds, as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE. \nWe are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds, close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere; CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California; Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like shapes of : \n3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY \nThe VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day. \nIt is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the head of a large American Corporation, and this is his party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war paint. Charlie is going on and on : \nCHARLIE ... It's crazy -- sugar is up to 200 dollars a ton -- sugar ! \nLAWYER What about oil ? \nCHARLIE Food, oil --look, let me show you something. This is the economy of the United States in two years -- \nHe takes a newspaper, draws a circle. \nCHARLIE (continuing) This is West Germany. (he draws another, bigger circle) This is Japan. (another , bigger) This is Italy. (a dot) This is Iran. (a very big circle) And this is Saudi Arabia... In two years ? (a gigantic circle) Do you understand ? \nACCOUNTANT What's to prevent it ? \nCHARLIE Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you, I didn't build a two-billion-dollar company in the last twenty years by doing nothing. We can protect our interests. (pause, for a drink) We are still the most powerful nation in the world. Militarily. \nHe leans to his associates, in a half-whisper. \nCHARLIE (continuing) You know bodyguard; he was a captain in Viet Nam. You talk to him, except he won't talk. This kind of man can kill you with his pinky. A nice quiet fella, though. \nThe VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group. \nCHARLIE (continuing) Carries a attache case at all times. You know what's in it ? (another sip) An Ingram Machine pistol. \nGradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it : \nCHARLIE\t\t\t\t\tWILLARD (V.O.) I don't tahe chances, and\t\t\tBullshit. You can kill neither should this country.\t\t\twith the ridge of your If we're strong, we should\t\t\thand to the throat; you protect our interests, and\t\t\tcan crush a skull with we should have the respect\t\t\tyour knee... but you of the world, even if it\t\t\t\tcan't kill anybody with takes another war.\t\t\t\tyour pinky. \nThe VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party : Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES. \nWILLARD (V.O.) The attache case has been empty for three years, but it makes him safe to think there's a machine pistol in it. \nI don't like automatic weapons. They jam. \nI saw a friend of mine get ripped open because he flicked his M-16 to automatic, and it jammed. How much money did the contractors make on the M-16 ? \nOur VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some reading, flirting, drinking. \nWILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) He likes to hear stories about Nam. I tell him I can't; they're not cleared. The truth is he wouldn't understand. \nWe can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We MOVE CLOSER. \nWILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) There's no way I can tell them... what really happened over there. \nI wouldn't've believed it if someone'd told me. \nWe are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips from a beer, but we cannot see his face. \n", "test1_true": "DISSOLVE TO : \n4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY \nA Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes. Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L. WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his shoes and sell him things. \nWILLARD (V.O.) But I know how it started for me -- I was on R. and R. in Saigon; my first time south of the DMZ in three months. I wasn't sure, but I thought this guy was following me. \nWillard looks back. \n5  HIS VIEW \nan American CIVILIAN. \n6  MED. VIEW \nWillard ducks into a bar. \n7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY \nNot much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by. \nAn INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of drinks and approaches Willard's table. \nCAPTAIN How about a drink ? \nWILLARD Sure, thanks. \nHe sits down at the table with the drinks. \nCAPTAIN Winning the war by yourself. \nWILLARD (he calls for the waiter) Part. \nCAPTAIN Which part is that ? \nWILLARD My part. (TO THE WAITER) Beer, with ice and water. \nCAPTAIN That's good gin. \nWILLARD I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis. \nCAPTAIN Delta ? \nWILLARD No. \nCAPTAIN North ? \nWILLARD Yeah. Way north. \nCAPTAIN What unit were you with ? \nWILLARD None. \nCAPTAIN Rangers, eh? \nWILLARD Sort of. \nThe JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over his shoulder. \nCAPTAIN Were you Longe Range Recon -- \nWILLARD No -- I worked too far north for LRRP. \nHe reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar, then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway. \nCAPTAIN That's quite an array of ribbons... \nWILLARD Let's talk about you. \nCAPTAIN I was an FO for the 25th. \nWILLARD Tracks ? \nCAPTAIN Yeah. \nWILLARD Fat. That's real fat. \nCAPTAIN Sometimes. \nWILLARD At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ? \nCAPTAIN Thirty -- sometimes fifty. \nWILLARD You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them. (solemnly) I swear to God I would have, too, if ... \nCAPTAIN I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam. \nWILLARD We do. \nCAPTAIN How long were you up there ? \nWILLARD A long time. \nCAPTAIN A year ? Waiter another beer. \nWILLARD I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me. \n", "test1_id": 2736, "test2_input": "Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain. He rises and comes over to the bar. \nWILLARD (continuing) What do you want ? \nCIVILIAN (indicating the Army jeep) If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us. \nWILLARD Whose orders ? \nCAPTAIN Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang. \nWILLARD Who are you ? \nCIVILIAN The agency. \nWillard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks roght out toward the jeep without saying another word. The Civilian follows. \n8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK \nA darkly painted \"HUEY\" ROARS over low paddies and jungle before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily fortified, concealed compound. \nWILLARD (V.O.) They took me to some place outside Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters for all operations in South East Asia. I'd worked for Intelligence before -- \nArmed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground corridor -- they enter. \n9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM \nA door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic maps and filled with smoke. \nThe whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly reclaiming it. \nWILLARD Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir. \nCOLONEL (O.S.) Okay, Willard, sit down. \nWillard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN. \nCOLONEL Have you ever seen this officer before, Captain Willard ? \nHe points to the Major. \nWILLARD No, sir. \nCOLONEL This gentleman or myself ? \nWILLARD No, sir. \nCOLONEL I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ? \nWILLARD I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir. \nMAJOR Very good. \nHe turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map. \nCOLONEL You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ? \nWILLARD I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir. \nThe officer smiles at this. \nCOLONEL Then you can appreciate Command's concern over their -- shall we say 'erratic' methods of operation. (pause) I have never favored elite units, Captain, including your paratroopers or whatever. Just because a man jumps out of an airplane or wears a silly hat doesn't give him any priviliges in my book -- not in this man's army. \nMAJOR We didn't need 'em in Korea -- no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy and an M-1 Garand, none of this fancy crap -- no sir. \nCIVILIAN (stopping him) Major. \nCOLONEL We have Special Forces A detachments all along the Cambodian border. Two here and another one here -- twelve or fourteen Americans -- pretty much on their own; they train and motivate Montagnard natives; pick their own operations. If they need something, they call for it, and get it within reason. What we're concerned with is here. \n10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP \nCOLONEL The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba. It was originally a larger base, built up along the river in an old Cambodian fortress. The area has been relatively quiet for the past two years -- but -- \n11  MED VIEW \nCOLONEL ... Captain, we know something's going on up there -- Major -- \nThe Major looks at some papers in front of him. \nMAJOR Communications naturally dwindled with the lack of V.C. activity, this is routine, expected ... but six months ago communication virtually stopped. \nCOLONEL About the same time -- large numbers of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent began leaving the area -- this in itself is not unusual since these people have fought with the Rhade Tribe that lived in the area for centuries. But what is unusual is that we began to find Rhade refugees too -- in the same sampans as the M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid of V.C. They've put up with war for twenty years -- but something is driving them out. \nMAJOR We communicate with the base infrequently. What they call for are air strikes, immediate -- always at night. And we don't know what or who the air strikes are called on. \nWILLARD Who ? \nMAJOR You see, no one has really gone into this area and come back alive. \nWILLARD Why me ? \nMAJOR Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel, Special Forces. We understand you knew him. \nHe puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand. \nWILLARD Yeah. \nCOLONEL He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba. \nThe Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder, flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military. Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like someone dumb, except very fast. \n", "test2_true": "GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background. \nSECOND VOICE Blue Delta five This Big Rhine -- three Need that ordinance immediately Goddamn give it to me immediate Christ -- Big Rhino -- Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn. \nA heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER -- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words. \nTHIRD VOICE This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta. \nMAJOR That's Colonel Kurtz. \nKURTZ (V.O.) I want that napalm dropped in the trees -- spread it among the branches. \nWe'll give you a flare -- an orange one -- bright orange. (STATIC) We'd also like some white phosporous, Blue Delta. White phosporous, give it to me. \nSTATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off. \nWILLARD I only met Kurtz once. \nCIVILIAN Would he remember you ? \nWILLARD Maybe. \nCOLONEL What was your impression of him ? \nWillard shrugs. \nCIVILIAN You didn't like him. \nWILLARD Anyone got a cigarette. \nThe Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks. \nWILLARD (continuing) I thought he was a lame. \nCOLONEL A lame ? \nWILLARD This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument. \nCOLONEL About what ? \nWILLARD I don't know. He was a lame, that's all. \nCOLONEL But why ? \nWILLARD He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill. \nCOLONEL Well, he's killing now. \nWILLARD Maybe. \nCIVILIAN What does that mean ? \nWILLARD Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it. \nCOLONEL It's got to be Kurtz. \nCIVILIAN The point is that Kurtz or somebody attacked a South Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three days ago. Last week a Recon helicopter was lost in the area -- another took heavy damage -- direct fire from their base camp. \nWILLARD Our Recon flight ? \nCIVILIAN Ours. \nWILLARD Touchy. \nCIVILIAN You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out. \nWILLARD You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet. \nCIVILIAN Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command. \nWILLARD Terminate ? \nCIVILIAN Terminate with extreme prejudice. \n12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA \nA waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms. \nA Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area. This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle- dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet, M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard. \n13  MED. VIEW \nWe hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE. WILLARD (V.O.) I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean. \nWILLARD Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise. \nCHIEF All right with me, I used to drive a taxi. \nWILLARD Let's go. \nThe Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard and otherwise go about their work. \nThe twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads to the ocean. \nDISSOLVE TO : \n14  FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA \n", "test2_id": 2737, "test3_input": "WILLARD So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here. \nKILGORE And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz? \nWILLARD I met him. \nKILGORE You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one. \nWILLARD You'll find enough Cong up there. \nKILGORE What about this point here? \nHe puts his finger on the map. \nKILGORE (continuing) What's the name of that goddamn village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook names all sound the same. \nHe motions to one of his surfers. \nKILGORE (continuing) Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop? \nMIKE Boss left. \nKILGORE What do you mean? \nMIKE It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell. \nLANCE Nice. \nWillard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore. \nKILGORE Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left. (to Willard) There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break. \nMIKE It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point. \nKILGORE How big it is? \nMIKE Six to eight feet. \nKilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters. \nKILGORE (to himself) A six-foot left. \nWillard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea. \nLANCE Boss. What's the wind like. \nMIKE Light off shore -- really hollow. \nWILLARD We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning. \nCHIEF The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point. \nKILGORE Hell, we'll pick your boat up and lay it down like a baby, right where you want it. This is the Cav boy -- airmobile. I can take that point and hold it as long as I like -- and you can get anywhere you want up that river that suits you, Captain. Hell, a six foot left. (he turns to an advisor) You take a gunship back to division -- Mike, take Lance with you -- let him pick out a board, and bring me my Yater Spoon -- the eight six. \nTOM I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's -- \nKILGORE (hard) What is it? \nTOM Well, I mean it's hairy in there -- it's Charlie's point. \nKilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated. \nWILLARD Charlie don't surf. \n44  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS - DAWN \nWhat seems like hundreds of Hueys standing, their rotors churning a great wind -- Inside, the men of the 1st Cavalry Airmobile -- toughest unit in Vietnam. \nKilgore's helicopter is being loaded with ammunition and has surfboards strapped underneath. \n45  MED.

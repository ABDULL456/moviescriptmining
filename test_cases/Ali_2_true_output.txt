LT. JEROME CLARIDGE ...and you will take one step forward as your name and service are called, and such a step will constitute your induction into the Armed Force indicated. 
Lt. Claridge begins to read the names, and services...the young Men dutifully stepping forward. Ali expects his name to be called. Instead... 
LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (CONT'D) Cassius Marcellus Clay. 
It's quiet. Dead quiet. Ali's lips move. NO sound comes out. We anticipate him stepping forward...he doesn't. LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (CONT'D) Mr. Clay, I am required to inform you that refusal to accept a lawful induction order constitutes a felony under the Universal Military Training and Service Act, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment and a five-thousand-dollar fine. Do you understand? 
ALI (nods) Yes. 
TWO FBI AGENTS in suits have appeared. 
LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (repeats) Cassius Marcellus Clay. Ali doesn't move. 
LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (CONT'D) (a third time) Cassius Marcellus Clay. 
Herbert's dying.    Ali "stands his ground..." and the die has been cast. 
A MAN (presenting badge) Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Clay, you're under arrest for refusing induction... 
As they turn around and handcuff him. 
EXT. HOLIDAY INN (HOUSTON) - ALI + ENTOURAGE - LATE AFTERNOON 
approach from two vehicles. Rudy and SIX LARGE MUSLIMS escort Ali through the crowd of media trucks, reporters and conspicuous unmarked police cars and neighborhood people. 
ALI 
waves in Robert Lipsyte, the New York Times sportswriter in his late 20's we've seen before. He and Howard Bingham, waiting inside, know each other. They enter. The phone's already RINGING. 
INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM + BALCONY - ALI 
on the phone, on a long extension, joined by Lipsyte and Howard Bingham, while Bundini keeps at bay reporters at the front door. It all feels like a rock group in town for a concert. 
ALI (listens; to cam.) Ask Chauncey Eskridge in Chicago. He's my lawyer. No. I'm out on bail. (goes onto balcony [rear shot]) Yeah, I fight. I fight clean. I'm an athlete. Army's there to kill, kill, kill. My religion forbids that. No. I never shot anything in my life. (turns) Do I know where Vietnam is? (wry; playing to Bingham) Yeah. It's on TV... (beat) In southeast Asia? It there, too? (beat) That's a joke, man...! 
Ali hangs up.   The phone rings again. 
ALI (CONT'D) (frustrated) What do I think about who?      Vietcong? 
Next is something Ali has not deduced. Ali perceives it intuitively and reflexively. As with other of his decisions, once made, he doesn't hesitate to speak them. And he won't waver. He says... 
ALI (CONT'D) Man, I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong. 
It goes dead silent.   Ali listens.   Lipsyte is stunned. So's Howard. 
ALI (CONT'D) No Vietcong ever called me nigger. 
BINGHAM You know what you j-j-just said...? 
He hangs up. 
LIPSYTE From Europe to China...every home in America...the world's gonna know what the heavyweight champion of the world said about the U.S. war... 
ALI So what? (beat) I ain't gonna be what anybody else want me to be. I'm not afraid to be what I want. And think how I want. 
And that's the real Ali, right there. 
INT. HOLIDAY INN, ALI'S SUITE - ALI - NIGHT 
laying on the sofa. Dundee, Pacheco and Rudy have joined. There's the feeling the house is a bunker. Phones ring. Television is on. LIPSYTE, taking notes, watching Walter Cronkite on TV. He crosses to Ali. Dundee's on the phone. LIPSYTE (reading) Nixon, the Republicans, Boxing Commission in New York, Cleveland and L.A. (a foregone conclusion) But you're also getting attacked as unpatriotic by the NAACP, Roy Wilkins, Jackie Robinson, the New York Times and Joe Louis... 
The expression on Ali's face is blank, as if he's accepting a pounding: he knows what it is; it's not a surprise. 
INT. GRANT PARK UNDERGROUND GARAGE - QUIET - NIGHT 
A very low ceiling; we're in a green-lit cavern with a low ceiling. Chauncey Eskridge and Ali wait. Ali's in the backseat of a 1961 Lincoln. Two FOI guards stationed at the distant ramps allow a Black Oldsmobile to pass. 
BOB ARUM 
a New York lawyer and promoter arrives and climbs out of the Oldsmobile. Ali opens the door...but doesn't get out... 
ALI (to Arum) People are following me... 
BOB ARUM I got almost nowhere I can promote a fight for you. Plus, I think they're going to vacate you from the crown. 
ALI What? 
BOB ARUM Yeah.   If you're convicted. 
ALI They gonna take away what no fighter in the world can? 
BOB ARUM And New York may revoke your boxing license. 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE You sure you want to do all this? (politics) Your next three to four years are every heavyweight's prime. And there are few of those years... 
ALI What 'bout Terrell? 
BOB ARUM We'll know if we can fight Terrell in Illinois this afternoon. Terrell's running his mouth. He said if you're called, you should serve... 
ALI (angrily) Motherfucker. He got a deferment for bein' too tall, or havin' flat feet. Why don't he serve for me? Tellin' me what I should do...

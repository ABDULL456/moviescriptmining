DAY. \nJames sits opposite his father at the table. Joe eats and hums and sings a blues tune, No More My Lord. \nJames beats his stick on the leg of the table perhaps to join in and impress his dad. \nJoe acknowledges the beat that James is creating. For a brief moment, father and son are making music together. \nJoe quits singing but James continues beating the stick on the table. \nJOE BROWN Quit that. Driving me crazy. \nLITTLE JAMES Keep singin'. (James taps the stick quieter. (Staring at his father.) \"No more my Lord\" \nJOE BROWN I said stop! \nJoe gets up. Takes the stick and snaps it in two.

I said stop crying. \nSuddenly the shack door opens, and James runs out. \nHe sprints full pelt through the woods. He comes to a clearing. He slows, approaches us and suddenly stops, breathing heavily, he stops and looks straight at us. Levelly. \nBLACKOUT.

And I knew that I would now... \nEven wider to reveal BOBBY BYRD and the rest of the flames dancing in sound stage dressed to resemble a Ski Lodge. \nFRANKIE AVALON and THIRTY VERY WHITE EXTRAS dance around James and the flames. Everyone is in argyle and bright colors. \nTo the side, FILM CREW MEMBERS AND A DIRECTOR do their best to keep up with the rhythm. James is killing it. His legendary moves in full force. \nJAMES (CONT'D) I feel nice. Like sugar and spice. \nSLOW MOTION PHOTOGRAPHY \nMusic stops. (Tom Newman theme here) James watches the cast, crew and Flames doing their thing for camera. \nJames turns to us and speaks. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Take it and flip it. \nEND SLOW MOTION. END TOM NEWMAN THEME. \nJames removes his sweater and begins dancing and singing again but now to a faster version of \"I GOT YOU\". He smiles at us, looks into our eyes. We push in tight. \nWe pull back to reveal James now singing this song in the future at The Olympia show. He's sporting a \"natural\". Beautiful girls dancing behind him. \nFlash- We are back to \"Ski Party\". Now the boring extras are up on their feet. They dance with precision the way Mr. Brown would prefer. Just for us, James has transformed the \"Ski Party\" into something way cooler. \nJames' feet slide and move him back toward the door of the ski lodge set. \nJAMES (CONT'D) I feel good and I knew that I would now. So good. So good. Cause I got you. \nJames moves outside the door and does a split in the pile of fake snow. \nWe are now back to reality. James is again wearing the sweater. The extras are now seated and clapping in a corny fashion. \nThe stage bell rings. Over a loudspeaker- \nVOICE That was great James. \nFrankie Avalon runs up to James.   James remains in his split. \nFRANKIE Wow, James. You've got some groovy moves my friend. \nJAMES Thank you, Mr. Avalon.

James drops the suit and runs to the opposite embankment. \nAs James tries to climb the embankment, the police car stops, two officers get out. \nJames can't get a footing on the steep embankment.   We now see that James is wearing the lynched man's shoes. \nCLOSE ON SHOES: \nDigging deeper and deeper in the soil embankment.    BLAM! A gun fires. \nJames stops climbing and turns to see two guns pointed at him. He slides back down the embankment and raises his hands. \nCUT TO: \nFLASH! James gets his mug shot.

So you gotta go find him. \nBig Junior looks to the ground and nods. \nJAMES (CONT'D) What'd Aunt Honey say? \nBIG Aunt Honey say she can't help you right now. Not this week. \nJAMES Go find my daddy, Big. Please! Okay? \nBig Junior sighs, really uncomfortable. \nBIG Aunt Honey already talked to him, James. Your daddy say it's a bad time too. \nJames fills with panic. \nJAMES So, he knows I'm here? \nBig looks all around, everywhere except at James. \nBIG He say ain't nothing he can do. Got money problems. Sorry. \nHe shrugs and walks away. \nINT. CELL. NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nJames turns from the window. He goes to the sink of his tiny cell, heaving for breath. He looks at himself in the tiny cracked mirror. \nJAMES Don't cry Junior. Don't cry now. \nJames begins expertly tapping his sliding his feet on the floor. A more developed version of the tune he arranged in his head during the boxing match is heard. James stares at us in the mirror. He smiles. \nWARDEN (O.S.)

You can get mad. Try to fight it but if it's God's truth. It's God's truth. James is supposed to be in front. I saw it happen. And the man in front has to BE the man in front. It ain't always pretty but that's the man's responsibility if he wanna stay there. And you and me can't know what that is. We ain't supposed to. So, don't lie to yourself Maceo. Every man in this band walks taller because he with James Brown.

But we're also here to pay tribute to one of the greatest Americans, Dr. Martin Luther King. So, let us look at each other and pledge that whatever else any other community might do we in Boston will honour Dr. King in peace. \nJames steps forward. \nJAMES Brother before I get to this next thing I wanna say. He's a young man you dig. He's a young man so he's thinking together. The man is together. Give him another round of applause. \nJames watches the restless, shouting, crowd.

Tense promoters and politicians to the beating rhythms. \nThe band whipcrack into I GOT THE FEELING. James pulsates. Spins. Pushes the stand away. Zip! It's back. \nA kid at the front gets onto the stage and sprints for James only to be tackled by James' security. Another clambers up but is kicked back by a police officer. The audience react badly. \nAnother kid gets on stage and cops harshly push him to the floor and throw him back into the audience. Police come out onto the right side of the stage and shine torches down into the audience. They shove people back down. \nA kid in a white jacket leaps on stage right in front of James. For a moment everyone stops. A white cop appears from nowhere and viciously bodychecks the kid back into the front row in full view of the cameras. \nThe mayor stands in the wings flanked by policemen.   Dede stands behind them watching nervously. \nMAYOR Oh no. \nOn stage James stops the band. \nJAMES Wait a minute. Step off. Move off. I'll be a'ight here. I be fine. \nJames waves the police off the stage on either side to cheers and whistles from the audience. \nSuddenly a ten year old kid appears next to James from out of the audience. He seems amazed to find himself there. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Do you wanna dance son? You dance. \nNo longer held back by police more kids invade the stage. James respects them all, shaking hands and looking at them eye to eye. Kids throng around him on stage. He's losing control. \nJAMES (CONT'D) C'mon. C'mon now. Y'all go down. Go back down. Don't nobody else come up. Wait a minute. Wait. Ladies and gentleman. This is no way. This is. We are black. We are black. (Cheers.) Wait a minute go back. Can't y'all go back down and lets do the show together. We're black don't make us all look bad. Let me finish the show. Step down there. Be a gentleman. Lets represent our own selves. Lets represent our own selves. \nOne by one they step back down into the crowd. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Now I ask the police to step back because I figure I could get some respect from my own people. Now we together ain't we. (Cheers! Screams!) Hit that thing man. \nThe band strike back up and James kicks back into \"I Can't Stand Myself\" The stage clear. The crowd calmed. The panic over. \nMAYOR (to a policeman) Holy shit.

In America today you've either got to be an entertainer or a ball player or what? If you poor, young and black, what is there? And you ask me why they on the street? It ain't politics we watchin'. It's economics. \nINT. JAMES BROWN PRODUCTIONS LEAR JET.

What it say to you, a street kid from Augusta, Georgia in the White House? \nBART It says you kissin' up to the Man James. \nJames is taken aback. No-one else in the world could say this. \nJAMES You asking me to turn this plane around and stand up the President? \nBART No. I'm saying who gives a shit. You're already screwed, James. Think about it.   If you stand up Lyndon Johnson to go kiss up to the Panthers, you ain't gone be playin' Vegas anytime soon because if they think you can stop a riot, they sure as hell will expect you to start one. \nJAMES So here I am. Just a sorry soul brother whining inside his private jet, huh? \nThey both laugh. But James is troubled. Bart tone changes. \nBART Don't be scared my friend.

James and Teddy's hair is cut into a short natural. Everyone looks at each other. \nJAMES Hit it. \nThe band starts. James makes a few adjustments. Jimmy Nolen strikes up a womp-womp sound on a single string. The horns do the James trademark ladidadidat. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Quit it.

Dede and Teddy are there, along with some of James' other kids. \nJAMES (CONT'D) How we all doin'. Hope this ain't too late for you folks. \nJames and Teddy stand before the group.

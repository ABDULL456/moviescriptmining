{"train": "GET ON UP \nWritten by \nSteven Baigelman, Jez Butterworth & John-Henry Butterworth \nScreenplay by Jez Butterworth & John-Henry Butterworth \nEXT. ROAD. AUGUSTA. 1988. \nA hot muggy Georgia morning. A pickup truck comes around a corner and moves towards us. Inside, music plays on the radio. We can't quite see who's driving. \n2   INT/EXT. PICKUP TRUCK/AUGUSTA STREETS. MOMENTS LATER         2 \nThe driver heads down the road. He beats his hand on the steering wheel to the rhythm of the music. The driver turns up the music. As the rhythm speeds, so does the truck. \n3   INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME                                    3 \nA WOMAN, 40, sits on toilet within a stall using the bathroom. She's smoking a cigarette. \n4   EXT. PARKING LOT. MOMENTS LATER.                             4 \nCars parked in rows. The pickup pulls into the lot and screech-stops. \nINT. ADJACENT OFFICE. INSURANCE SEMINAR. DAY. \nAbout 30 people are attending a seminar. Behind a SEMINAR PRESENTER, The truck can be seen outside a window, stereo thumping. \nSEMINAR PRESENTER Which brings us on to Dental Insurance. Generally speaking, when you receive care from a participating PDP dentist, your out- of-pocket expenses will typically be lower than if your were to accept care from a dentist outside the group. The law deems it illegal for dentists to charge any more than the network approves... But listen, in my three and a half years of experience in this business people mainly care about keeping their premiums low. So, each of you must be prepared to sell the network to your clients and always cater to their specific condition. \nAnnoyed, the presenter turns momentarily to the truck. \nINT/EXT. PICKUP TRUCK / PARKING LOT \nA fifty-five year, out of shape black man in mirror shades and a shell-suit. He's breathing heavily. Patting the dashboard, as the song ends. The man sits there a moment and exits. \nJAMES BROWN hitches up his pants, and walks across the lot. \nINT. NONDESCRIPT OFFICE \nThere's no one around. He's jumpy. His movements odd. Twitchy. \nJAMES (To himself) Where's everybody? \nAround a corner he comes face to face with a cleaner, MAVIS, who is wearing headphones as she vacuums. \nMavis screams and removes her headphones. \nMAVIS Mr. Brown. You scared me! \nJAMES Mavis. Where's everybody at? I got a meetin' this mornin'. \nMAVIS It's Sunday, Mr. Brown. \nJAMES No, it's Tuesday, Mavis. \nJames is caught flat-footed. SOMEWHERE OFF a toilet flushes. \nHe rounds the corner. No-one. Opens the bathroom door. Looks inside. Sniffs. Slams it and storms off down the corridor passing a sign outside his office that reads: GET ON UP. \nINT./EXT. ADJACENT OFFICE/ PARKING LOT. DAY. \nAs the INSURANCE SEMINAR presenter continues, the woman who was on the toilet takes her seat. \nSEMINAR PRESENTER Now, understand that not all people have the same type of needs. When it comes to an insurance plan everyone is different. (MORE) \nSEMINAR PRESENTER (CONT'D) You can't possibly sell the same monthly premium to just anyone who strolls through your door. If you learn one lesson this weekend, let it be this: We must accommodate the specific condition of the client. Bottom line! Their needs are- \nThe adjoining door flies opens as James enters, pissed. \nJAMES OK Stop. Sir. Stop. Who been in there? \nSEMINAR PRESENTER Excuse me? \nJAMES I own this building, someone has been in there used my commode. Now who was it? \nSEMINAR PRESENTER Sorry. We're actually renting this part of the building today, and we're in the middle of a seminar. \nJAMES I don't care if you're in the middle of a heart attack son. Someone been in there, I hear the chain flush, I can smell it. Now who it was? \nINSURANCE SALESMAN It is. It's fuckin' him. \nBACK AT THE FRONT someone sniggers. \nJames spins round. SILENCE. Someone sniggers behind him. James spins back round and approaches the salesman. \nJAMES Something funny? \nINSURANCE SALESMAN No, sir. \nJAMES Then why you cats laughing? \nINSURANCE SALESMAN I wasn't laughing. It wasn't me. \nJames stares at the man. Turns on his heel. \nHe storms out of the building and across the lot to his pickup truck \nTHE PAYBACK starts: insanely tight, deep funk. \nThe Infantrymen laugh and slap hands. As they walk toward stage... \nNEWS JOURNALIST (To Cameraman) We can't use that. \nINT. PLANE. IN THE COCKPIT. \nPILOT                          SOLDIER I'm losing her. We're going     Oh mother of Christ! down. \nThe wounded beast judders in low over the canopy and starts sinking into it when the jungle suddenly clears. \nEXT. TAN SON NHUT AIRFIELD 9TH DIV INFANTRY CAMP OUTSIDE NOM PEI. JUNE 1968. SAME TIME \nThe damaged plane breaks out over the field with both engines smoking. Barely regaining control, the pilots make a very hard landing. \nMUSIC: \"There Was A Time\" begins. \nArmy personnel race toward the plane. Next to the runway an old hanger is teeming with soldiers. \nEXT. AIRFIELD. MOMENTS LATER \nBiblically pissed, James and Bobby walk from the flaming plane alongside CORPORAL DOOLEY. \nBehind them, in deep shock, Maceo and the rest of the band, clutching instruments. \nCORPORAL DOOLEY Welcome to Bear Cat, Mr. Brown. Corporal Dooley. USO Liaison officer. Can I first say I'm a big, big fan of your mus- \nJAMES You in charge when Bob Hope was over Corporal? \nCORPORAL DOOLEY (proudly) I was. \nJAMES (to Bobby) Mr. Byrd, You think Bob Hope's plane got shot down? \nBOBBY No sir, Mr. Brown. \nAs they approach the hanger filled with troops, a chant begins inside. \nTROOPS James Brown! James Brown!   James Brown! \nCORPORAL DOOLEY (Tightly) Sorry about the plane trouble- \nJAMES Plane trouble? They tried to kill James Brown today. You wanna go down in history as the man who killed the funk? \nJames and crew near the rear stage entrance of the hanger. \nCORPORAL DOOLEY. About the show, if you could just keep it to 25, 30 min- \nJAMES. (Interrupting) Whoa, whoa, whoa. \nBOBBY (under his breath) Oh no. \nJAMES Corporal, let me tell you the first thing about James Brown. The first thing is James Brown don't tell no man his business. He won't tell you how to take Pnom Ridge or how you screwed up the Tet offensive. I don't tell you how to fight your war Corporal. So don't tell me when, where or for how long I can be funky. \n25   INT. HANGAR. CONTINUOUS.                                        25 \nHUNDREDS OF HOT, STEAMING TROOPS ROAR, like a thousand space rockets taking off at once. It's awesome, shaking the stage. \nTROOPS James Brown! James Brown!    James Brown! \nJames and Bobby enter the hanger. We walk with them and strut up six steps and onto the stage. \nBobby stands back and watches as James grabs the mic and looks out over the sea of faces. \nJAMES Sorry we're late.    Are you cats ready? \nThe troops roar even louder. \nJames turns straight to camera, flashes his smile and talks directly to us. \nJAMES (CONT'D) (quietly) Are you cats ready? \nEXT. A PINE WOOD. 1941. DAY.    JAMES 8 YRS \nA cold fog hangs in the fading sunlit trees. \nEight year old James stands alone in a forest clearing. He looks all around him. \nJAMES Momma? \nHe scans the trees. He's alone. \nSUDDENLY in the trees he glimpses someone. A woman. 30. Red dress. She giggles as she scampers from behind one tree to another. She peeps round. He beams. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Momma! \nHe chases her. She's laughing. \nSUSIE You can't catch me! \nEach time he loses her she peers from behind a tree he squeals in delight but she disappears. He is suddenly alone. \nJAMES (Scared) Momma? \nShe jumps out from behind a tree and scoops him up. \nSUSIE I gotcha! \nHe squeals and laughs in her arms. \nEXT. WOODED PATH. DAY. 1941 \nJames stares at Ben in the mirror. \nJAMES Gertrude! \nGertrude walks in. \nGERTRUDE Yes, Mr. Brown. \nJAMES I said I didn't want to be disturbed. (holds out his hand) That'll be twenty dollars. \nGertrude walks over and hands James the same twenty spot Ben gave her. Ben winks at Gertrude as she exits. \nBEN BART James, I just spoke to the producers. They've requested the Rolling Stones close the show. \nJames looks confused. \nJAMES Huh? \nBEN BART Rolling Stones, James. You'll go on right before them. It'll be you, then the Rolling Stones top of the bill. \nJAMES The Rolling Stones, huh? \nJames to Bobby. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Then why we here, Bobby? \nBOBBY We here to play, James. \nBEN BART You're here because they want you here, James. You're James Brown! I want you here. Because this isn't the chitlin' circuit man. We're done with that shit. This is an audience full of white faces and you're gonna make them love you. You're just not closing the show. \nHis eyes focus. \nBEN BART (CONT'D) James. Now don't start. Let it go. \nBOBBY This don't matter, James. \nTHE DOOR FLIES OPEN. JAMES BROWN STRUTS DOWN THE CORRIDOR AS BEN BART FOLLOWS. \nJAMES The Rolling Stones ain't even had a hit record here. \nThey pass several dressing rooms along the way. \nJAMES (CONT'D) They ain't even ever played in America. Have they? \nJames passes a dressing room where a group is rehearsing. \nBEN BART They're just kids. In a year from now we won't even know who they are. It's business, James. \nJAMES And it's my business to hear what they got to say about this. \nHe passes another dressing room with a group of guys harmonizing. \nJames stops, glances at the VERY WHITE CALIFORNIA GROUP and then to Ben. \nBEN BART James, don't... \nJames is off again. He rounds the corner walks straight up to the Stones dressing room. On the door it says THE ROLLING STONES. \nA guy on the door stands but knows he can't stop James Brown who walks straight in. Ben stops at the door and watches. \nJAMES BROWN Fellas, how ya doin'. Mr. Jagger. Mr. Richard. Hear you boys are closing the show. Did you know that? \nMICK JAGGER Uh..That's what they're saying. Yeah. They just told us. \nMick looks over to Keith and the rest of the Rolling Stones. \nJAMES BROWN Uh-hmm. Well, I was told I'm closing the show. That's why I flew out here. \nMick leads James to a couch. They sit. \nMICK JAGGER Listen man. We're filming a movie here today. This isn't live. \nJAMES I know that. \nMICK JAGGER What I mean is, the order in which we play makes no difference. They're going to edit and arrange the show any way they want later. \nJames raises and shakes Mick's hands. James shakes a couple of the other guys hands. \nJAMES BROWN Y'all have a great show, fellas. \nWe march out with James. He turns to Ben. \nJAMES I'll be on stage in five. They better be ready. And the white people. \nBEN BART Yes Sir, Mr. Brown. \nJAMES struts to the side of the stage. On a television backstage we see a live feed of: \nARCHIVAL FOOTAGE: THE SUPREMES FINISHING THEIR PERFORMANCE. \nJames waits in the wings. On the other side of the stage, the Rolling Stones watch. James flashes his trademark smile. They all wave back. \nArchival Footage: \nJAN AND DEAN approach the microphone and introduce the flames. \nZAP -a white follow spot burns into James as he stands head bowed. Check jacket, waistcoat, black pipes and mirror boots. \nHe throws his head back, steps forward and the groove starts. The screams rise to a deafening pitch- \nINT. SHACK. DAY - 10 WEEKS LATER. 1941 \nJoe's back. Fully bearded. He unpacks his sack onto the bed. In the doorway appears the boy. Half naked. Covered in mud. Its clearly been weeks rather than days he's been alone. \nJOE (Chuckling) Look at you boy. You go clean yourself up `fore you come in here. \nCUT TO: Int. SHACK. KITCHEN TABLE. DAY. \nJames sits opposite his father at the table. Joe eats and hums and sings a blues tune, No More My Lord. \nJames beats his stick on the leg of the table perhaps to join in and impress his dad. \nJoe acknowledges the beat that James is creating. For a brief moment, father and son are making music together. \nJoe quits singing but James continues beating the stick on the table. \nJOE BROWN Quit that. Driving me crazy. \nLITTLE JAMES Keep singin'. (James taps the stick quieter. (Staring at his father.) \"No more my Lord\" \nJOE BROWN I said stop! \nJoe gets up. Takes the stick and snaps it in two. James stares hard at his father's face. \nJOE BROWN(CONT'D) You gawkin' at me? \nJames stays on Joe.   Joe quickly rises and yanks James out of his chair. \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. SHACK. DAY. 1941 \nFrom outside the shack, we hear the sounds of abuse. \nJOE BROWN (O.C.) Stop crying. I said stop crying. \nSuddenly the shack door opens, and James runs out. \nHe sprints full pelt through the woods. He comes to a clearing. He slows, approaches us and suddenly stops, breathing heavily, he stops and looks straight at us. Levelly. \nBLACKOUT. A THUMPING RHYTHM BEGINS. \nBeneath his tears a smile emerges... \nCUT TO: \n42   INT. HOLLWOOD SOUND STAGE - DAY   - 1964 JAMES 31YRS            42 \nCLOSE ON: An argyle sweater.   The intro to I GOT YOU (I FEEL GOOD) ramps up. \nWe widen to see James Brown singing. \nJAMES I feel good! And I knew that I would now... \nEven wider to reveal BOBBY BYRD and the rest of the flames dancing in sound stage dressed to resemble a Ski Lodge. \nFRANKIE AVALON and THIRTY VERY WHITE EXTRAS dance around James and the flames. Everyone is in argyle and bright colors. \nTo the side, FILM CREW MEMBERS AND A DIRECTOR do their best to keep up with the rhythm. James is killing it. His legendary moves in full force. \nJAMES (CONT'D) I feel nice. Like sugar and spice. \nSLOW MOTION PHOTOGRAPHY \nMusic stops. (Tom Newman theme here) James watches the cast, crew and Flames doing their thing for camera. \nJames turns to us and speaks. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Take it and flip it. \nEND SLOW MOTION. END TOM NEWMAN THEME. \nJames removes his sweater and begins dancing and singing again but now to a faster version of \"I GOT YOU\". He smiles at us, looks into our eyes. We push in tight. \nWe pull back to reveal James now singing this song in the future at The Olympia show. He's sporting a \"natural\". Beautiful girls dancing behind him. \nFlash- We are back to \"Ski Party\". Now the boring extras are up on their feet. They dance with precision the way Mr. Brown would prefer. Just for us, James has transformed the \"Ski Party\" into something way cooler. \nJames' feet slide and move him back toward the door of the ski lodge set. \nJAMES (CONT'D) I feel good and I knew that I would now. So good. So good. Cause I got you. \nJames moves outside the door and does a split in the pile of fake snow. \nWe are now back to reality. James is again wearing the sweater. The extras are now seated and clapping in a corny fashion. \nThe stage bell rings. Over a loudspeaker- \nVOICE That was great James. \nFrankie Avalon runs up to James.   James remains in his split. \nFRANKIE Wow, James. You've got some groovy moves my friend. \nJAMES Thank you, Mr. Avalon.   And please call me, Mr. Brown \nAs Frankie nods and walks away, James catches eyes with BOBBY BYRD, 30. Bobby stares quizzically at James as he remains on the floor in his split. \nBOBBY Get up, James. \nJames, 19 years old, sits on a bare wooden chair. James' aunt, HONEY, 40, is in attendance. Next to her sit two young black women dressed very sexy. \nWARDEN So you want to be a singer? \nJAMES Oh no Sir. Truth is I ain't really into all that so much. Not no more. \nFive white adults sit behind a long table, studying him. \nWARDEN But the other boys, they call you Music-box. \nJAMES It's just a old nickname is all. I'm looking for something stable. Steady. I want to be a Mechanic. \nWARDEN So first a singer and now a Mechanic? \nJAMES Yes Sir. There's a fella I know back in Augusta, he owns a garage, he said he could find me a job if- \nWARDEN You can't go back to Augusta. In the event of parole, the Court in Augusta ruled you not be allowed to set foot in Richmond County til the full term of your sentence. \nJames is silent. Aunt Honey locks eyes with the Warden and smiles. \nWARDEN (CONT'D) Do you know anyone outside Augusta who could act as your parole sponsor? Any family? Associates? Is there anywhere else you could go? \nAunt Honey and the girls raise their skirts up there legs ever so slightly with subtle sexual gestures. \nThe Warden gives Aunt Honey and the girls a disapproving stare. \nSTAMP! A red stamp hammers down - REFUSED. \nINT. HALL. ALTO. DAY.   JAMES 19 YRS \nA BAND, The Starlighters \"entertains\" the inmates. A tall black kid in a white tux, flanked by four other boys. \nBOBBY BYRD We the Gospel Starlighters, from right here in Toccoa. Three Four.. \nThe vocal group rip into a juiced up \"Mary Don't You Weep\". And its good. James watches intently. The music plays over... \nJames begins to sing along and dance. Two rows back, a huge, badass looking kid is staring. James turns and stares straight back. \nThe big kid walks up to James. \nBIG KID You eyeballin' me, Music-Box? \nThe big kid punches James in the gut. James struggles to his feet and punches the BIG KID and fights back fearlessly. \nAll hell breaks loose. Two rough factions break out and the melee spreads. James picks up a chair and throws it at the big kid. He ducks. \nCUT TO: \nINT. INFIRMARY, ALTO. LATER THAT DAY \nBobby sits in a chair outside the infirmary.   He holds a cold press to his nose. \nJames, bruised and torn but apparently victorious is led by a warden into the infirmary to cheers from his friends. He's seated next to Bobby and cuffed to the chair. \nJAMES What happened to you? \nBOBBY Someone threw something. \nJAMES Gee, that's too bad. \nThey sit there. James shrugs. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Walk in the jungle sometimes you get bit by a snake. \nBOBBY (Deadpan) I'll try an' remember that. \nThey sit there. \nJAMES Say. What's that song you done? \nBOBBY We only done half of it. \"Mary Don't You Weep\" is an old gospel, man. You ain't heard that before? Everybody be doin' it. \nJAMES BROWN I ain't heard nothing since my radio got busted. That's a cool song bro'. You sung it great. That sounded real sweet. \nBOBBY BYRD Crowd sure went crazy. (James smiles. Then:) You like music? \nJAMES Only thing keeps me sane in here. \nBOBBY How long you in for? \nJAMES Five to thirteen years. \nBobby moves his chair an inch or two away. \nBOBBY What did you do? \nJAMES Robbed a suit. \nA nurse leads Bobby inside the exam room. \nBOBBY They give you five to thirteen for... (Shakes his head) That's time man. \nJames turns to the doorway and continues talking to Bobby as the nurse tends to his nose. \nJAMES Tell me about it. \nBOBBY You get parole? \nJAMES Board say I need a permanent family address and a job. But see I don't know no folks here. \nLITTLE RICHARD We'll be back in ten to flip you again! Whoooo! Yeah! \nBobby scans the crowd. \nBOBBY BYRD (Frustrated) Look at these people James. Man! I'm ready. You know'm saying? When it gone be us up there? \nJames hasn't moved. He's still staring at the stage. \nJAMES BROWN Now. \nBOBBY BYRD What? \nJames turns to Bobby. \nJAMES BROWN There's a piano. And a stage. And right now. (Looks at it) Ain't no one on it. \nNAFLOYD What you talking about? We can't go up there. \nJAMES BROWN Why not? Like you said, Nafloyd, \"We just playin' around with \"Caldonia\". So let's go play around. \nBobby nods, and James strides towards the stage and gets up. The others look at each other: HOLY SHIT! and scramble after him. James gestures to them to pick up instruments. \nJAMES BROWN (CONT'D) Ladies `n Gentlemen. Hope you're enjoying the show. \nNafloyd speaks into his mic. \nNAYFLOYD We're the Star- \nJames quickly interrupts. \nJAMES We're the Famous Flames. \nNafloyd looks at Bobby. \nNAFLOYDS Flames? \nBABY ROY Famous? \nJames hollers. The Flames hit their queue, bang on, and they TEAR INTO Caldonia. James loosens with every bar. Unhooks the mic. Throws a move. As he hits the hook again the audience is drawn to his energy like a magnet. \nBACKSTAGE DOOR - Leaning against a wall backstage, Little Richard looks up from his pocket mirror. Frowns. \nLITTLE RICHARD What is that? \nIN THE WINGS - the club manager watches on unsure what to do. \nON STAGE - James and Bobby, hollering into the same mic are ripping the place up. \nIN THE WINGS - Little Richard appears at his side, fuming. \nLITTLE RICHARD (CONT'D) Get those bitches off my stage! \nPower to the stage is cut off. The performance is over but the crowd go batshit. NAFLOYD, BABY ROY are shaking. \nNAFLOYD We the Flames. \nBOBBY looks at JAMES. A new, knowing look. They bow as one, turn, and walk offstage, CLEAN PAST a furious Little Richard. James returns his glare with an even straighter one. \nJAMES BROWN (Deadpan) Just keepin' it warm for ya. \nHe walks past. \nLITTLE RICHARD Hey. What's your name? \nJAMES The Famous Flames. \nJames looks back levelly. \nLITTLE RICHARD No. What's your name? \nThey look at each other. Neither blinks. \nEXT. MALT SHOP. NIGHT. \n2AM. James sits alone at a table off to the side of the order window. \nLittle Richard dressed as a chef comes out of the kitchen and drops two burgers in front of them. James and Richard, cigarette in a long holder, holds forth. \nLITTLE RICHARD I play a show in Lafayette last week twenty thirty girls pass clean out. Need oxygen. I'm killing `em James. They should lock me away. I cut loose it's like a spaceship land. Did I say I got a record out? They drop it five times a day on WIBB. Five times a day. (He looks at James) And I'm flippin' burgers. You know why? (MORE) \nLITTLE RICHARD (CONT'D) Cause WIBB antenna reach 60 mile. 60 mile. This country is 5000 miles top to toe and 7000 coast to coast. You catch the wind, get a hit, a real hit, every inch of that is yours. \nJAMES BROWN So how we catch the wind? \nRichard smiles. Stops the waitress. All charm. \nLITTLE RICHARD Sugar, may I borrow your pencil? \nHe takes a napkin. Starts writing on it. All business. \nLITTLE RICHARD (CONT'D) You got a hundred bucks? \nJAMES BROWN No. \nLITTLE RICHARD Rob a liquor store. You take a hundred bucks to WIBB in Macon. Ask for Big Sauk. Say Richard sent you. You make an acetate. Ten copies. You send them to these people. \nHe writes them down. James watches. \nJAMES BROWN It's that easy why don' you do it? \nJAMES Bobby. I can't make practice Thursday. I gotta get married. \nBOBBY (Whispers) What are you talkin' about? Who you marryin'? \nJAMES That chick I met after the Stone Mountain Show. Velma. \nA silence falls. \nBOBBY What about my sister? \nJames flashes a devilish smile. \nJAMES Oh, I'll still harmonize with Sarah from time to time. \nBOBBY I ain't playin', James. How you gone do all this? \nJAMES Do all what? \nBOBBY Practice. The road. Makin' records. Startin' a family. \nJAMES I ain't startin' nothin', Bobby. Except what we doin'. \nJames reaches under the bed and pulls out the acetate they just recorded. \nJAMES (CONT'D) That us. We in there Bobby. \nJames holds the record close and studies it with Bobby. \nBOBBY That's all the money we got. And some we don't. \nJAMES But, it is beautiful. All those little grooves. That's us. It's been written. (MORE) \nJAMES (CONT'D) Now, men gone lay with women. That's nature. But a woman ain't never gone stop a real man from what he's supposed to do. That's God. Husband? Daddy? That gives a man purpose. Man gotta have purpose. But purpose don't stop me neither, Bobby. Ain't nothin' gone stop us. Nothin'. And that's God too. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHENETTE. 1955. DAY.   JAMES 22 YRS \nJames Brown stares back at his infant son with the same wary look. \nJAMES You gone smile for me, Teddy Brown? \nHe bounces him on his knee once. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Come on, boy. \nTwice. The kid smiles. James suddenly becomes moved. He leans over and kisses his son. \nVELMA We out of greens. You want me to go pick some up? \nVelma, a cute nineteen year old girl is fixing dinner. \nJAMES No baby. \nA car horn outside. He looks out the window. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Baby. I gotta go. \nVELMA But I got your supper. \nHe hands her the baby, kisses her passionately. She melts. \nVELMA (CONT'D) Wake me up. \nJames pretends to look shocked, covers Teddy's ears. \nEXT. JAMES AND VELMA'S KITCHENETTE \nJames bounds off the porch towards the station wagon. \nVelma steps onto the porch with the baby. She suddenly looks very young. \nJames turns to his family and pats his hand over his heart. \nJAMES (shouts out) I got you right in here, Teddy Brown. \nVelma raises Teddy's hand and waves it at James. \nJames begins to serenade \"Lost Someone\" to his family... \nEXT. CRAPPY STATION WAGON. RURAL ROAD - SUNSET. 1955 \nCLOSE ON: \nJames continues to sing. Only now he's humming as if working out a new way into \"Lost Someone\". \nWe widen to see The Flames, Baby Roy, Nafloyd, Bobby and James pushing an old crappy Chevy station wagon down the road. Nafloyd has the easy job of keeping the steering wheel straight. \nNafloyd is clearly annoyed by James' humming. \nJAMES BROWN Nafloyd, you know in \"Let's Make It\" when it goes (he hums). If you go up there and hold it, like. (hums). It's gone be sweet. Make it like you got a harmonica stuck in your throat. \nNafloyd looks back at Bobby Byrd. \nNAFLOYD SCOTT You know what? Why don't you sing it, James? \nJAMES BROWN What? I can't sing it. It's your song man. \nNAFLOYD SCOTT But I ain't singing it right James. I just ain't. (MORE) \nJames winks before the waitress walks away. \nBOBBY I gone call the Two Spot. \nJames expression instantly changes. \nJAMES Oh no. \nBOBBY What? \nOver at the door, A white guy. Obviously a cop. He waves our waitress over. \nWHITE GUY Excuse me ma'am, I just came from a place called the Tuxedo Room. I'm looking for the boys who were supposed to be playing there tonight? \nJAMES (whispering) I ain't supposed to leave Bibb County without telling my parole officer. \nBOBBY Shit James! What we do? \nBobby looks around and James has disappeared under the table. Bobby drops like a stone under the table as well. \nBobby peers around the booth for a peek. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) He's coming this way. Oh shit. \nJAMES I can't go back to prison Bobby. \nThe waitress sits the man down at a nearby table. \nWHITE GUY I've been driving across over two states looking for these boys. They have to be here in Macon. Tell ya what, I'll make it worth your while if you can tell me where they are. \nThe man hands the waitress ten bucks and a business card. The woman shrugs as she reads the card. \nWAITRESS King Records? What did they do? \nWHITE GUY Everything right. \nBobby and James look at each other. \nJAMES BROWN (pole-axed) King records? \nBobby crawls out from under the table suddenly all business. \nBOBBY Evening, Sir. I'm Bobby Byrd this is my associate James Brown. \nJames crawls out and stands before RALPH BASS. \nJAMES Hi. \nBOBBY I understand you're looking for the Famous Flames. \nLATER AT THE DINER - Bobby and James sit with Ralph Bass. The breakfast crowd has cleared out. \nRALPH BASS I'm Ralph Bass from Federal records in Cincinnati. An imprint of King Records. I heard your acetate. I want you to come to Cincinnati. I want you to make a record for King. \nBobby looks back at him. Nods. \nBOBBY King records. As in King Records. The King records. \nThe waitress arrives with a donut and a plate of steak and eggs. She places the steak and eggs in front of James and winks. \nRALPH BASS You sure put a lot into that cut. The main vocal. You got some soul right there. \nBOBBY Uh.. That's not me. That's uh. That's James. \nRALPH BASS That you singing? \nJames looks BACK TO US. \nJAMES Yeah. That's me. \nEXT. FEDERAL/KING RECORDS, CINCINNATI.

He leans out and the Flames lean in to the same mic. \"Please please don't go\".. \nIN THE BOOTH -- \nGene Redd mans the desk. Ralph stands nervously while SYD NATHAN, the impressively fat 60-year-old owner of King sits in jamjar spectacles and Bakelite Headphones, listening. \nJAMES Wait...wait a second here- \nRaggedly they all come to a halt. Nafloyd seems annoyed. \nNAFLOYD What we stop for? That was cookin'. \nEveryone looks pissed at James who seems agitated. Byrd's nervous they're wasting time. \nBOBBY It's OK sir we OK. We can just start right at the top. \nJAMES It ain't right. It's too slow.     We gotta pick up the pace fellas. \nSYD We got the level on his main mic way up to drown out the crowd. You gotta get him to hold back a little in the first number! \nCLOSE UP: Big two inch tape magnacorders turn on brushed aluminium spindles. Recording live. \nBen Bart looks over at James at the curtain edge. A man possessed. \nBEN BART I think its too late for that. You ain't got a breeze, Syd. You got a hurricane. \nJames looks at Bobby. Bobby nods. James nods back. The band vamp. \nJAMES Watch me. \nThe curtain opens. BANG! James Brown & the New Revue are in perfect timing looking impeccable in their new sapphire blue suits. The crowd goes wild with excitement. \nMr. Dynamite steps on stage-- and floats and dances across bare planks like they were polished ice. He reaches the mike. \nJAMES (CONT'D) You know I feel alright. (Yeah!) You know I feel alright children. (Yeah!) I feel aaaaaaaallllriiiiiiight. \nLes Buie whacks the guitar strings and the world ceases to spin. A rising 6/8 blues riff pulses up like adrenaline. \nAs he sings the song, a shock wave blasts out from the stage of the theatre on 125th street and into the Universe. \nBobby might as well be sitting on the moon.    He never misses a beat. \nCUT TO: \nJames Brown and the New Revue are tearing up their second number, \"Think.\" \nSYD NATHAN now sits in the audience surrounded by a SEA OF BLACK FACES. We gather that Syd has never really experienced \"The Show\". He smiles and nods to the beat. \nJust then a female seated behind him shouts as the horns kick in. \nFEMALE IN AUDIENCE Blow it fuckers!!! \nJames stares into the darkness. He's already begun to sweat. The drums stop a six punch combination from the horns dead. He reaches for the mic without looking. Leans in and locks eyes with Syd. \nJAMES Think...Think...Think...About your bad self... \nJames drops to his knees. The crowd goes wild. \nA few rows behind Syd, we find Susie Brown sitting in the audience. James' mother has come to the show. \nINT. APOLLO DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT. \nAfter. The cheers still ringing out. People packed into his dressing room. Champagne corks pop. Congratulations from all. \nJAMES Thank you. That's very kind of you. \nBobby, at the door. Can't get to him. Turns to Gertrude. \nBOBBY Gertrude. Get everybody out. \nGERTRUDE What? \nACROSS THE ROOM \nJAMES We gone celebrate tonight. And then tomorrow we gone Wilmington and do it to it all over again. \nBOBBY Mr. Brown. Excuse me. Mr. Brown. (Then) ...James. \nJames stops. Turns to face Bobby's grave expression.     Bobby whispers in James' ear. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) There's a woman here, Mr. Brown. She says she's your mother. \nJames stops dead. COMPLETELY STILL. We push in. He doesn't blink. \nFLASHBACK - EXT. STREET. NIGHT.      1942. JAMES 9 YRS \nLittle Junior walks Twigg street at night. Passing dives and joints. \nSuddenly he stops, across the street, he sees a woman coming out of a bar arm in arm with a BLACK SOLDIER. \nHe follows her up the street. She's weaving and laughing with the drunk soldier. \nJAMES Momma? \nSUSIE and the soldier walk into a side yard where a party is in full swing. \nJames approaches her from behind. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Momma it's me. It's me. \nShe turns. Focuses blearily. \nSOLDIER You know this little nigger? \nFor a moment it looks as if there is a flicker of recognition. Then swivels her head to look at the soldier. She shakes her head. \nSOLDIER (CONT'D) Beat it. \nYOUNG JAMES But Momma! \nThe soldier picks up a rock a throws it. \nSOLDIER Get the fuck out of here. \n92    INT. AUNT HONEY'S BEDROOM.

Item. Promoter. (He turns to Bart) What'd you think Pop? \nBART Its beautiful Jimmy. I can't do it. \nBart picks up a piece of fish and eats it. \nJAMES Why not? \nBART Universal Attractions promotes many acts. I can't piss off the 60 or 70 promoters in this country to skim a little extra on the James Brown Show. \nJAMES It's not a little. If the show sells, and it's sellin', we talking thousands of dollars a night. Difference per year between 2 and 3 million dollars. \nBART And I'm out of a job. Think you're forgetting I don't just work for James Brown. \nJAMES And there's my next point Pop. Why not? (Bart stops) (MORE) \nJAMES (CONT'D) I can do something for you, and you can do something for me, and it ain't buy me no Cadillac. Did you buy Wilson Pickett a Cadillac? Did you buy Jackie Wilson a Cadillac? You know which way this thing is going Pop. I got people around me who don't see it. \nBart looks at him for some time as a black 1965 limousine pulls up to the fish house. \nJames looks straight back to us. Smiles. Ben Bart rises and grabs a piece of fish. \nBEN BART (to James) I thank you for the fish. And I'm gonna need some benefits, boss. \nBart crosses to the limo and leaves. \nBLACKOUT. SCREAMS.

The attraction immediate. \nMan's World continues over the next three scenes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SECURE ROOM \nBen Bart counts bundles of cash. He shuts a case full of money. Hands it to 300lb MINDER.

THEATER. NIGHT.   LATER THAT SAME NIGHT. \nJames is concluding his show with Please, Please, Please.     He is at the tail end of his cape routine. The cape is brilliant blue with rhinestones. \nHe glances at Dede one last time from under the cape. \nINT. BACKSTAGE. POST SHOW. NIGHT. 1965 \nJames walks down the corridor backstage. Stops. Sniffs. Opens an equipment room door. NEW BAND MEMBER is inside smoking reefer. \nJAMES Impetigo? \nDEDE It's a skin infection. \nVELMA All that mess round his mouth. That's impetigo. It's highly infectious. \nVelma turns to Dede. \nVELMA (CONT'D) I'm just sayin' Mrs. Brown, I wouldn't go too near Teddy. Not unless you wanna catch impetigo. \nDEDE Thank you, Velma. I'll consider myself warned. \nVELMA Warned? Oh, that's a whole other conversation. Welcome to the family. \nDede and Velma smile at each other. \nJames looks at the two women then to Teddy.   He pulls Teddy in close. James turns to his other kids. \nJAMES Listen up. Which one of you cats want to fly to Reno on daddy's airplane? \nThe kids all say \"me!... me!\" The kids, Bobby and Dede walk up the steps onto the plane as Velma gets in her car. \nJames lingers. \nJAMES (CONT'D) (to Velma) You need anything? \nVELMA I'll let you know.

JAMES \nJames is giving a press conference to a group of journalists. \nBobby, Teddy and Dede stand next to James. \nINTERVIEWER Welcome to Reno, Mr. Brown. What exactly do you call your style of music? \nJAMES BROWN I call it James Brown music. What I mean is, it's so far ahead of it's time that they ain't got a name for it yet. Take another record, any record from your stack at home. I don't care if it's from Motown or Stax or whatever...and put it on your box. None of them are gonna sound like mine. Not even my own old records. Just like the title says, it's a \"new bag\". See the funk is in the bass. The bass never changes. It's a groove, lady. Soon as you hear that groove, I know I got you. \nINTERVIEWER And what exactly is the groove? \nJAMES BROWN The groove is something you feel. The groove is solid. Bam Bap. It don't move. It's like a heartbeat. It's inside you, driving everything. Hard. Flat. A groove. \nINTERVIEWER But how exactly do you define it? \nJAMES BROWN I just did. (Then) See Miss. See there's some things, they're just too big to fit in a magazine. But we all feel it. Even little Teddy here know it when he feel it. \nJames groans \"Um booga chooca. Um\". Teddy is lit up; thrilled. He sings. \nTEDDY \"Um Booga Chooca\" \nJAMES BROWN See. Right there. We all feel it together. And that's the groove. Understand? \nINTERVIEWER (Checks her questions) So what's your favorite food? \nJames catches Dede's eye. She and James share a knowing look with Bobby.

BOBBY sits across the aisle. \nBART Then we got a day between Raleigh, Carolina and Columbia two days after. \nJAMES Day off? \nBART Sure. Regroup. Rest the horses. \nJAMES We ain't payin' the horses to rest `em. Besides, we got a day off in two weeks in New Orleans. The boys can get their wives, girlfriends along, kick back. What's between Raleigh and Columbia? Spartanburg? \nBACK THE PRESS CONFERENCE: \nBOBBY BYRD Well see, James started out in Augusta. Then his family moved to Toccoa.

Hold about 750 people. Guy named Bennett used to own it. Yeah, Spartanburg. Yeah, we'll play there and I can bring in my masseuse from Anderson. \nJames disappears again. \nBobby turns his head to a hotel balcony. Vicki grabs Bobby's face and turns it back toward her. \nVICKI ANDERSON (CONT'D) Quit lookin' for James Brown and keep your eyes on me, Bobby Byrd. \nShe sexily rises and goes and sits on a lounger. \nBobby watches her all the way. She catches his eye. Looks at him, raises an eyebrow like \"what you looking at?\" He feigns innocence, turns, and smiles. \n116   EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - SAME TIME                              116 \nJames discreetly watches from behind a blind on his balcony high above. \n117   EXT. HOTEL POOL. CONTINUOUS.                                117 \nPee Wee, in jams, walks with a new band member, FRED WESLEY, who is still wearing a suit. \nPEE WEE Fella's this is Fred. I thought we'd show him how things work? \nPee Wee pulls out a cheap wig from his pocket and puts it on. \nEveryone around the pool begins to laugh as Pee Wee begins demonstrating how things work to Wesley. Pee Wee is full on imitating James Brown \nPEE WEE ELLIS So when I do this.. (Turns head, stamps foot) Means you give it some punch. See. When I dip like this. (Dips hip and slides) \nBOBBY Means less sharp. Bring it down. \nFred nods. \nPEE WEE ELLIS When I do this. (Juts chin back and forth) \nMACEO Mean I give it some heat. \nPEE WEE ELLIS Right.

I'm in control Mr. Parker. Got it. Don't ask about that again. \nPee Wee flashes his hand at Maceo. \nPEE WEE That'll be ten thousand dollars. \nThe band loses their shit at this one.    Laughs all around. \nAn hotel employee walks out with a note and hands it to Pee Wee. Pee Wee reads. Pee Wee removes the wig. \nPEE WEE (CONT'D) He's called a rehearsal. \nBOBBY When? \nPEE WEE Now.    We gotta go get dressed. \nMACEO You're kidding. Tell me you kidding. \nEXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY / POOL. \nHiding behind a partition, James raises a cigarette to his mouth. \n119                                                  JAMES 34 YRS 119 INT. NEW ORLEANS HOTEL REHEARSAL ROOM. 1967 \nThe band, all in their suits, with their instruments. All glaring. One more pissed off than the next.

You get with an Asian chick? That a whole other story. No spank but they got it baby they got it. Anyway what was I talkin `bout? \nMACEO Your Chinese knees Mr. Brown. \nJAMES That's right. That it. I got these Chinese knees. (MORE) \nJAMES (CONT'D) That's how come I can dance the way I do. Anyway. One. Two. Three. Four. Hit it. \nThe band starts up. During the introduction to COLD SWEAT, MACEO comes in late on the Sax. Everything stops. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Stop. Maceo. (Laughs) What you doing man? You coming in maybe a little too late. What's the matter son. You lost your feeling? \nMACEO (Flatly) No Sir. I ain't lost no feeling. \nSILENCE. James tunes into the vibe for the first time. SOMETHING's wrong. \nJAMES (Innocently) Something wrong, Maceo? (SILENCE. Directly) Is something wrong, Maceo? \nBOBBY BYRD James- \nJames rounds on Bobby. \nJAMES You got something to say Mr. Byrd? (Silence. Smiling) Because a man got something to say he should say it. You got something to say? \nSILENCE. Vicki looks away. All at once James loses it. \nJAMES (CONT'D) (Shouting) Well then you just HOLDING UP THE REHEARSAL Mr. Byrd. \nJAMES BROWN (CONT'D) Then it's musical. So play it like I say. From the top. \nThe groove of COLD SWEAT comes to life. The beat heavier, almost irregular but actually in the pocket, the horns and Bass clipped, drum-like, the off rhythm of Jimmy's guitar bringing the whole room together. \n119A   EXT. POOL AREA BAR. SAME TIME.                            119A \nOur racist couple has now bellied up to an outside bar.

James has long since gone. Maceo and Bobby relax at the bar. \nMACEO Bobby, James Brown's my meal ticket. So I just shut my ears and chomp down his bullshit. But why you soak it up man? You his best friend. You know him for time brother. And he treat you like that. I was you I'd bust him in his damn mouth. \nBobby Byrd nods his head. \nBOBBY BYRD I hang in there cause I remember the day that I knew. Knew I was never gonna be in front. \nHe looks at Maceo with a calm, measured sense of reality. \nBOBBY BYRD (CONT'D) You work so hard at this one thing and then one day you realize it ain't supposed to be you. You can get mad. Try to fight it but if it's God's truth. It's God's truth. James is supposed to be in front. I saw it happen. And the man in front has to BE the man in front. It ain't always pretty but that's the man's responsibility if he wanna stay there. And you and me can't know what that is. We ain't supposed to. So, don't lie to yourself Maceo. Every man in this band walks taller because he with James Brown. Every man in this band believe in himself a little more because he's with James Brown. \nMACEO You sure you just ain't too scared to be in the front? \nBOBBY BYRD No. But my ears a' open.

We missing something. (They look at each other. It was perfect.) (MORE) \nJAMES (CONT'D) Pee Wee, get over here by the microphone. And bring that horn box. That's where you keep the wig, right? \nThey all stop. Oh. Shit. \nPEE WEE Mr. Brown? \nCUT TO: \nNow Pee Wee stands at the Microphone, uncomfortable, with the wig on, singing the song. \nJames is in with the horns, who are all crying with laughter, enjoying the hell out of this rare moment of levity. James, deadpan, eggs him on. Pee Wee calls for a horn solo from him. \nSUDDENLY there's a commotion in the mixing booth. James brings them to a stop. \nJAMES What is it? Why we stop Henry? \nThe engineers hands go to their faces. Shaking heads. \nJAMES (CONT'D) What? What is it? \nBobby enters the room. \nBOBBY BYRD It's King.

They listen to me. They won't riot \nBART We have virtual race war looming across the South, Jimmy. Politics, 101?

TEN MALE FUNERAL ATTENDEES IN SUITS AND YAMMAKAS take turns shoveling dirt onto Ben Bart's casket. \nDede and James stand to the side. Completely distraught.

RECORDING STUDIO. LOS ANGELES. NIGHT. \nBAND MEMBERS FITTED WITH THEIR AFRICAN DASHIKIS are rolling a funky vamp together into a groove. Clyde hits a fat `pop pop' beat. Sweet Charles locks the bass line in to the beat. Country finds a chunky B-flat-9 rhythm on the guitar and the groove takes shape. \nThe door opens. James and Teddy walk in. James and Teddy's hair is cut into a short natural. Everyone looks at each other. \nJAMES Hit it. \nThe band starts. James makes a few adjustments. Jimmy Nolen strikes up a womp-womp sound on a single string. The horns do the James trademark ladidadidat. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Quit it.

James flies into I'm Black and I'm Proud. \nWHICH PLAYS OVER ADDRESSING US DIRECTLY \nJAMES (CONT'D) I think about a lot of things. About problems. About solutions. You know one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got in this country...is letting a person feel that they important. Feel that they somebody. It's it. Man can't get hisself together... ...until he know who he is and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from! WHERE WE ALL COME FROM! \nJames leaves us and continues with the song.

He squirms. \nJAMES You know I don't drink. \nYvonne pours a little champagne onto James' stomach.   She then begins licking it with her tongue. \nYVONNE Say it, Mr. Brown. Say you love me. \nIn a flash James rolls over and pins Yvonne down on her back. She screams with delight. \nHe whispers in her ear. \nJAMES Happy now? \nShe kisses him. \nYVONNE I'm pregnant. \nJames stares back at her without expression. \n135D   FLASH FORWARD - ADULT JAMES, IMMACULATE, LOOKING AT US. 135D THE SKYLINE OF PARIS IS BEHIND HIM. 1971 \nJames walks along the outside of Olympia Theatre in Paris in full costume. \nJAMES Now it's true, we work hard.

Stayed up in there for 66 weeks.. \nJames walks into the rear of the packed house. \nGIRLS AND GUYS SCREAMING, DANCING. JAMES IS INVISIBLE TO THEM. \nFrom the rear of the house, James watches himself and the band performing on stage. He and his band are IN MID-GROOVE.

The Night of Live At The Apollo. \nMUSIC: Wonder When You're Coming Home plays over: \nA woman in a flower print dress and a cheap hat sits on a bench with a coat over her arm. A young Bobby comes out of the dressing room. She stands. \nINT. APOLLO DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT. \nBOOM! A flashbulb goes off. \nJames sits next to his mother, on a couch, SMILING Happily, having the moment documented. She is smiling too. Bobby and other guests in the room watch the photographers. \nThe photographer is ushered out of the room by Bobby Byrd. \nJAMES Bobby? Get everybody out of here and wait outside. \nBobby ushers the guests outside. \nJames sits opposite his mother. She is very, very uncomfortable but trying to appear relaxed. \nSUSIE I was on the Subway last week, and the two kids next to me was arguing who was the best, James Brown or Little Willy John. And this one boy, he was saying \"James Brown the best\" \"There ain't no one better than James Brown\", he got so mad I thought he was gonna whup this other boy. And then- \nJames holds up his hand. She falls silent. \nJAMES Why tonight? (She stops, her face falls.) Why you come here? \nShe starts to flap. \nSUSIE Well. Sugar, I live over in Brooklyn... and you my baby and you here playin' the Apollo. \nJAMES I don't want you to feel proud. I ain't your sugar. I ain't your baby. Not then. Not now. And I don't want you to tell anyone you my momma, because you and me know that ain't true. \nSUSIE Your daddy beat me. Beat you. I stayed because I loved you. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife. Nothin' about being a mother. I did the best I could. I did that. (MORE) \nSUSIE (CONT'D) I left because I loved you. I ain't had nothing to make no other choice. I was shamed. I was. \nHe holds up his hand. \nJAMES See I thought about this. I know it weren't personal and that's why this ain't neither. It turned out fine. I didn't need you. I looked after James Brown. Made sure he was OK. No-one else. No-one help me. \nShe starts to cry. \nSUSIE I never wanted to be a momma. But I carried you, boy. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife or being a momma. But I carried you and I loved you when you were in me. I chose you. I chose you. \nJAMES Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. \nHe stiffly offers her a handkerchief. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Clean yourself up. That's it. \nJames softens. \nJAMES (CONT'D) I'm James Brown. And James Brown don't need nothing. Don't need no- body. \nSusie looks back a James. She doesn't move. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Why are you really here? What do you want? \nShe shakes her head, searching his face. James looks back unmoved. James reaches in is pocket and pulls out some money. He hands it to her. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Here. That's a hundred dollars. I'm sorry but I'm gonna ask you to leave now. \nHe sits perfectly still as she gets up. She walks to the door and turns to James. \nSUSIE You're so beautiful. You're so pretty. \nSusie exits into the party outside and shuts the door. \n143   EXT. CABIN - BARNWELL S.C. 1941.   JAMES 8 YRS              143 \nWe return to the day that Susie left. We stay on her face as she leaves her family behind. Tears stream down her cheek. \nJames tries to chase after his mother but Joe restrains him. \nJoe pulls a pistol from his belt. He fires. \nBark explodes from a tree a few feet from where Susie is walking. \nSusie flinches but never turns. \nINT. CORRIDOR. \nBobby waits. The door opens, and Susie comes out, tears in her eyes. She looks wildly into Bobby's face who has clearly heard everything. She runs off down the corridor. \nBobby looks through the open door. Devastated, James sits staring at the floor. He looks up at Bobby. \nJAMES Tell Pop to make sure she's taken care of. Whatever she needs. \nAs Bobby nods, James gets up, walks over to the door, and slowly closes it. \n145   INT. JAMES BROWN'S HOME. 1988. 18 YEARS LATER.              145 JAMES 55 YRS \nCLOSE ON - Numerous framed pictures of Teddy span all ages of his life now fill the top of James' dresser. \nWe widen to find James Brown sitting very alone in his bedroom staring at the pictures of his son. \nHe wears a bathrobe.   His hair is up in rollers. He's twitchy and sweating. \nHe raises a glass pipe to his mouth, lites the PCP within and inhales it. \nJAMES Well I ain't gone tell. \nThey laugh a little. When they stop, there's a long lull. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Well I was just passing. Playing a show tonight at the Omni. \nBOBBY Right. \nJAMES Say. Maybe you and Vicki could come along. We got a great new horn section. Tight. We getting there. \nBOBBY We got plans tonight. Vicki got family coming over. \nJAMES Well you think about it. See what Vicki say. \nBobby laughs. Rumbled. \nBOBBY Yeah. She still in charge. \nThey both chuckle at this. A nod of understanding. But then: \nBOBBY (CONT'D) You look well.. Man. I ain't seen you since- \nJAMES Teddy's funeral. \nBobby pauses, grows uncomfortable. Bobby throws his cigarette to the ground and stomps it out. \nBOBBY Right. Teddy's funeral. Damn. You look well. You shoulda called- \nJAMES You know, Bobby, they still don't know what happened to Teddy and that boy. Those boys weren't drinkin' or doin' drugs. \nBOBBY I know, James. \nJAMES No sir. Nothin' like that. He was a good boy. The car just hit that bridge head on. We ain't ever gone know how or why. They say he didn't feel a thing. \nBobby nods. \nBOBBY That's good, James. \nJAMES But we brought him back to Augusta didn't we? Got him home then sent him on to the Lord. \nBOBBY We did, Mr. Brown.    We did. \nJames stands there, fixedly. The Pool cleaner comes from around the truck, breaks the tension. \nPOOL CLEANER OK. Mr. Byrd. I fixed your problem. I'll be back in the Spring to open her up. \nBOBBY I'm much obliged. Do I have to- \nPOOL CLEANER No no. We'll send the bill on. Well that's that. Good day Gentlemen. \nHe gets in his truck and pulls away leaving Bobby and James standing in an awkward silence. \nJAMES Look at that. We got white folk cleaning our pool. Come a long way huh, Mr. Byrd? \nBOBBY Yeah. We come a long way. \nSuddenly this is awkward. For both of them. Bobby defuses it: \nJAMES You still makin' the steps, Mr. Byrd? \nBOBBY Here and there. \nJAMES You hurtin' a little in the hips? \nBOBBY A little. You? \nJAMES Not me. I just get stronger ever day. Gettin' better every day. \nJames pulls out two concert tickets from his jacket and hands them to Bobby. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Maybe you and Vicki got some friends who could come tonight. Good seats, too. \nJames turns sharply and walks back to the Limo. He sings to himself. \nJAMES (CONT'D) (Sings) Oh, Mary Don't You Weep... \nBobby listens. And remembers. \nJAMES (CONT'D) (Sings) Tell Martha Not to Moan. \nHe stops and turns to Bobby. \nJAMES (CONT'D) What's the next line? \nBobby looks at James. \nBOBBY I can't seem to recall. Was a long time ago. \nJames nods.   After a moment Bobby nods. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) See you around Mr. Brown. \nBobby turns.   James watches as he walks back to his house. \nJAMES See you around Mr. Byrd. \nJames walks towards his Limo. \nSFX: Audience noise, cheering, whistles, clapping. Louder. Louder. \n", "test1_input": "A police car pulls up next to him, the officer aiming a weapon and flagging the car down. James sees him and flinches. \nJAMES Don't hurt me. Don't stop me. Don't stop me. \nHe rams the cop car. It retreats. \nEXT. I-20. DAY \nThree prowlers and a highway patrol RV form a road block. A high engine note pierces the air. The police take up firing positions. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK. DAY \nJames sees the roadblock ahead. \nJAMES Don't stop me. Don't stop me. \nHe smashes through road block. The windscreen is blown out with gunfire showering James with glass. \nHe glances in the mirror as wind whips around the truck: \nUp ahead another police car sits in the middle of the road. A policeman steps out from the car firing his pistol at the pickup truck. \nJames makes a hard right down a dirt road. \nINT/EXT. PICKUP TRUCK. GRAVEL PITTS, DAY \nJames's front tires are blown out. James struggles to control the skidding vehicle. \nJAMES C'mon. C'mon. \nEXT. GRAVEL PITTS, DAY \nThe pickup truck rolls to a stop. Five various police cars from different jurisdictions enter the Pitts from five different entrances and take up positions blocking exit routes. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK. DAY. \nJames sits staring straight ahead. Breathing hard. A loud hailer off screen: \"EXIT THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD.\" James opens the door scattering glass onto the ground. \nAround the perimeter armed police tense. Safety's off. Keeping James in their sights. A young officer sweats nervously. \nJames stands next to the bullet riddled wreckage of his pickup, hands above his head. He leans back and sings to the sky. \nJAMES \"I Don't Feel Noways Tired\". \nEXT. AUGUSTA COUNTRY CLUB.   NIGHT.   1942   JAMES 9 YRS \nA wide, opulent looking club has taken residence in a huge antebellum home with wrap around porches. \nA crowd of Deep Southern white folk, in cocktail attire, fill both levels of the porches and spill out onto the lawn surrounding a BOXING RING. \nA GROUP OF SIX BLACK MUSICIANS FORM A DIXIELAND BAND. Without inspiration they play methodically to the all white crowd. \nA FAT, SWEATING ANNOUNCER, walks into the ring, grasps a dangling mic. \nANNOUNCER Aaannd now folks, before the main event, the Augusta Country club is proud to present to y'all it's Annual Charity ex-travagaaanza..! (Drum-roll) Ladies and gentlemen..The Battle... Royale! \nMusic. HALF A DOZEN BLACK BOYS enter the ring. Hyped. A glove is pulled onto one hand. The other tied behind their backs. They are blind-folded. \nA WHITE MAN with a BUCKET OF WHITE PAINT daubs a number onto each boy's chest. \nDING! DING! The boys stagger out, blindly swinging. The crowd roars, bangs the tables as they stumble, lurch, in the baying din. \nThe smallest of the boys stands stiff. He struggles to throw much less land a punch. The number \"One\" is painted on his chest. \nA much bigger boy, \"Number Six\" punches \"One\" in the gut. \"One\" goes down but then slowly rises. \nThe dixieland band watches the exploitation with both horror and intrigue as they can't help but wonder who will be left standing. \nThe band's sound begins to change. It becomes as energized as the match before them. They sink into the rhythm, and the effect is one of heightened energy. \nThe drummer begins to pull the beat and the bass player instantly follows suit finding the new pocket. The drummer and bass player share a glance. \nThis inspired pocket soars across the lawn and into the ears of boy \"Number One\". \nWe are now transported into the mind of \"Number One\". Complete silence except for the sound of the band. Then one by one all other instruments fade away leaving only the drum and bass. \nJames turns to the band and lowers his blindfold from over one eye. He catches eyes with the drummer and bass player. The drummer nods at James and smiles. \nJames nods back and closes his eye. The sound morphs again as \"Number One\" begins to arrange the music in his head to his own liking. \nJames opens his one eye and sees only the drummer and bass player on the stage. They are now playing what we and James are hearing in his head. \nJames covers his eye again with the blindfold and forms a slight smile. His stance becomes more relaxed. His body begins to swing and morph like rubber. \nHe throws a punch. IT LANDS. \nALL AT ONCE \"Number One\" dances forward, dips, swings and sweetly CONNECTS to \"Number Four\". As the vanquished head hits the canvas, the victor, \"Number One\", bloodied, panting in the waves of laughter and summer heat, stands alone. \nAs the boys hit the deck and are deemed \"out\" they are pulled off the mat and carried to the bed of a parked truck. \n\"Three\" goes down. Then \"Two\" and \"Five\". A ringside punter THUMPS the canvas with a fistful of dollars, berating him. People screaming with laughter. Only \"One\" and \"Six\" remain. Panicky, jerky, they stalk one another. Listening. \n\"Number One\" connects with lighting speed. \"Six\" removes his blindfold, jumps off the ring and runs across the lawn disappearing into the nearby woods. \n\"Number One\" stands victorious. The crowd goes wild. \"Number One\" absorbs the admiration as he slowly pushes up the blindfold and looks toward the bandstand. \nAll the band members have returned to the stand as in reality they always were. They clap wildly as the beat and rhythm of this budding continues in his head. \nTHE EIGHT YEAR OLD JAMES BROWN LOOKS RIGHT AT US. A level gaze. That million dollar smile, teeth coated with blood. \n", "test1_true": "CLOSE UP ON: \nThe June 1968 cover of Look Magazine: A silhouette portrait of James: \"IS THIS THE MOST IMPORTANT BLACK MAN IN AMERICA?\" \nEXT.

Please! \nThey look at the soldiers, who are also nervous. Marva looks out the window. Nothing but fire below. \nMACEO (CONT'D) (Shaking) Oh. My. God. \nDrummond taps the soldier opposite. Points out the window. A soldier looks out, turns white. \nSOLDIER Holy shit. \nIN THE COCKPIT - The pilots wrestle to keep the craft upright. Between them, a completely unruffled James Brown is holding court. \nJAMES See Captain Jenkins, the James Orchestra is a 22 piece, but the Gov'ment or the Army, powers't be say I can only bring six fellas. Right now I got 16 pieces sittin' in a Bangkok hotel. If I'm paying my own money to be here, and I am, I oughtta bring as many cats as I want.

James Brown was born dead but then I breathed.

Saying prayers. Moaning. James appears. \nJAMES Marva, fellas, Listen up. We under attack. \nMACEO No shit, Mr. Brown. \nJames flashes five fingers at Maceo four times. \nJAMES Watch that mouth, Maceo. That's twenty dollars right there. \nThe plane suddenly lurches forty five degree and lets out an awful groan. Everyone screams. Except James who is still standing like rubber even though he wasn't holding onto anything. Bobby sees this. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Mr. Byrd, I've decided to open tonight's show with \"I Got The Feeling\". \nJames demeanor somehow gives comfort to Bobby. James nods at Bobby and smiles. \nJAMES (CONT'D) How's that sound? \nBOBBY Sounds good, Mr. Brown. \nBobby smiles at James. The plane lurches again, Bobby screams. \n21   INT.

Loud and clear. \nHe looks at them both. \nJAMES (CONT'D) I see where we goin'. Saw it this morning when your secretary called ask me to come here an hour early. Alone. I knew it six months ago. Hell, I knew it the day I was born. \nJames looks back. He doesn't blink. He looks to us. \nJAMES (CONT'D) There's some things I'm gonna want. \n83A   INT. KING RECORDS. CONFERENCE ROOM. LATER THAT MORNING.    83A \nA receptionist shows the rest of the band in. The Flames join Ralph, Syd Nathan, Ben Bart, and James. \nBEN BART Come in Boys. Come in. \nThere's no chairs. They stand. \nBEN BART (CONT'D) Boys, I have something to show you. \nHe hands them each a record sleeve. They look down. \nBOBBY I don't understand. Is this some sort of mistake? \nNAFLOYD (Reads) His Famous Flames? \nThe sleeve has clearly printed on it \"James Brown and his Famous Flames.\" \nBABY ROY Sir, this ain't right. \nBEN BART We agree. See I believe it should say simply James Brown. The fact is Gentlemen, James Brown doesn't need the Famous Flames. King records and Universal don't need the Famous Flames. But James has requested that the name remain in some form. Now if you want to stay, stay, but from now on you work for James Brown, on James Brown's records. Should you find this disagreeable in part or whole, you can go home. \nNAFLOYD (Stunned) James? \nJames stares straight ahead. Nafloyd throws the record at the wall. Bobby stands there, stunned. \nSlowly, James looks at Bobby and then crosses to him. \nJAMES Bobby. It's just a name. Ain't nothing different between us. This for all us not just me. It's gone be good. \nBobby stares back. Nafloyd steps up to James. \nNAFLOYD James Brown. I never liked you. Come on. Let's get outta here.. \nHe turns and walks away with the band.    Bobby rises and follows out the door. \nPUSH IN \nOn James. Bart sits down opposite him. \nBART So. Do you know what you want James? \nEXT. WOODS. DILAPIDATED CABIN. 1941. \nFLASHBACK - JAMES, aged eight, outside the shack in Barnwell, beating his stick against the shack. \nYOUNG JAMES (Incredulous) I know exactly what I want. \nINT. KING RECORDS. CINCINNATI. DAY.    1962   JAMES 29 YRS \nSYD NATHAN Forget it. King doesn't make live albums. They're too expensive. \nJAMES I think a live album- \nSYD NATHAN James, your audience is Negro. Negroes don't buy albums. They don't have the resources. Especially not for a bunch a songs they already got. \nJames turns to Ben Bart. \nBEN BART James, Recording live is five, six times as expensive as the studio. And that's for some violin concerto at the Met. No one jumps up and shouts \"Blow it fucker!\" in the middle of The Magic Flute. \nJAMES But, Pop, you know my show. \nJames turns to Syd. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Mr. Nathan, you ain't ever even seen the show. My show. \nSYD Don't need to. \nSyd rises and begins to dance. He attempts the \"Mashed Potato\". \nJAMES Mr. Nathan- \nJAMES (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nSYD The \"Mashed Potato\". \nJAMES That ain't the \"Mashed Potato\". \nSYD Exactly. \nSYD (CONT'D) I can't do the \"Mashed Potato\". That's your job. That's the show. But what I can do is the business. \nSyd goes back to his desk and sits. \nSYD NATHAN So I stick to what I know. You stick to what you know. And that's the showbusiness. \nINT. ELITE RESTAURANT. 1962. DAY. \nBen Bart and James, in a booth. James silent, tense. \n", "test3_true": "BEN BART I'm not going to let you do that, Jimmy. \nJAMES Book it out next week for the whole week, go in, we drill it, we drill it, we drill it, then we drop it. \nBEN BART Forget it, Jimmy. It's too big of a risk. Let's order something to eat. \nBen signals for a waitress to come over.   James grows intense. \nJAMES I don't understand risk? \nJames stiffens. \nJAMES (CONT'D) I don't understand cos I'm just the \"show\"? Is that all I am to you, Pop? The show? The money? \nBEN BART Of course not, Jimmy. \nJAMES Sure it is. That's all me and my black brothers are to the \"White Devil\". We the show and you the money. And that's how the White Devil keeps it all. \nBEN BART I'm not the \"White Devil\". I'm trying to protect you. I'm doing my job. \nJames becomes intense. A waitress walks over. \nJAMES Pop, look me in the eye. \nBen stays on his menu. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Pop. \nBen looks up.    The waitress scurries away. \nJAMES (CONT'D) Yeah, I'm the show. But, if I'm spendin' my own money on the show, then I'm gone be the business too. (MORE) \nJAMES (CONT'D) And after we kill The Apollo, I'll kick over a few bucks to the white devil. Whatever I think he deserves. And If I'm payin' you, Pop, you gone show me how to do it. \nBen takes this in. \nBEN BART I'll call Nola Sound. They got these new three track stereo recorders from Ampex. \nJAMES And I want the best engineer in town. I don't care what it takes. I don't care what it cost. I want everyone in uniform, the ushers, front of house, the peanut peddlers. \nBEN BART We'll need the band in New York immediately. \nJAMES And I want `em in Sapphire blue suits. Pop. Sapphire. \nBEN BART Sapphire Blue. Underwear too. How does that sound? \nPop smiles as does James. \nINT./EXT. CAR/ APOLLO THEATER. 1962. NIGHT. \nBen Bart drives a sedan. James rides in the front seat. \nJAMES It's cold. It's cold. It's too cold man. It's too cold. Cold. Cold. \nThey round the corner. \nJAMES (CONT'D) C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. \nSUDDENLY and for the first time, we hear the classic James grunt, guttural. \nA THUMPING RHYTHM BEGINS. James, stock still, no longer looking out of the window. Head completely still. \nOut of the window: a line of people. On and on. We round the corner. More people. Another corner. More. \nThe doors of the theatre open as we pass. People rush forward as THE CAR PULLS UP. James gets out outside by the stage entrance. Ben follows. \nGERTRUDE Evening, Mr. Brown. Cold out tonight. \nJAMES Gertrude. See if you can get some coffee for the folks in line. \nJames walks into the stage door entrance of the Apollo. Ben follows with a big smile. It's happening. \nINT. APOLLO THEATER. STAGE. NIGHT. 1962 \nONE BY ONE TWELVE PAIRS OF PATENT LEATHER SHOES HIT THE STAGE. \nTHE NEW JAMES BROWN REVUE file in with instrument cases like some ultra hip sect. \nIn the dimly lit back stage we see the motions of opening their cases and begin setting up their stations, A beautiful black girl pulls up her mini to reveal even more leg. \nJames enters looking amazing in a cobalt sharkskin. He approaches the all new band. \nA member of the band, whose back is to us, peers out of the scarlet curtains towards the packed house. \nJAMES You ready Mr. Byrd? \nBobby Byrd turns from the curtains. THE ONLY SURVIVING MEMBER OF THE STARLIGHTERS. His profile lighted by a powerful spot. \nBOBBY BYRD (Ice cool) Ready Mr. Brown. \nGertrude rushes to James with his jacket. He smooths his hair. \nFATS V/O Are you ready for star time? Thank you and thank you very kindly- \nINT. APOLLO. STAGE. NIGHT. \nSyd Nathan and Ben Bart stand in the wings. Syd shouts in Ben's ear. \n"}

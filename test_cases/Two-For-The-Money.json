In this job you have to push the envelope every day. \nBRANDON glances at a nearby table, catches the eye of a stunning GIRL sandwiched between two middle-aged, overweight MEN.  WALTER catches the eye contact before she looks away.  The GIRL seems bored as the two big men heartily chow down. \nWALTER Look at that.  Beauty and the beasts.  What do you think of her, Brandon? \nBRANDON She's cute. \nWALTER Cute doesn't half cover it.  The girl's gorgeous.  And bored out of her mind.  Waiting for some young buck to save her from those two gorillas.  Check it out.  She's eyeing you again, Brandon. \nBRANDON So are the two guys she's with. \nWALTER I'll bet you 10-to-1 on a 1000 you can't pick her up, cash, if you leave with her. \nToni \nC'mon Walter.  You might as well go to Atlantic City and open a house account.  You know you can't gamble. \nWALTER Who's gambling?  It's a challenge.  If Brandon leaves with her I give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he made last year.  If not, he gives me a grand, which I'll give to you. \nBRANDON I don't bet, Walter. \n(glancing over, look from the GIRL) \n... But I do love a challenge. \nWALTER All right.  Before you bust a move, just one thing... \n(talks across the table, addressing the MODEL and the two MEN) \nExcuse me, I don't mean to interrupt but \nWalter con'd \nI have to know what's going on here. \nYou're drop dead gorgeous and your dates \nlook like they haven't missed a meal \nsince Christ died.  Seriously, you \ntwo are eating like you have a date \nwith the electric chair.  What's the story with you three?  I'm not gonna sleep if I don't know.  Lemme guess.  Garment district. The Hardy boys make lingerie and you're a model.  That \nit?  Close?  Sprechenzee English?  Sit down, sit down -- I'm just joking.  I better stop before I get stabbed with a fork. Bon apetit. \n(turning back, TONI staring at him) \nTONI What the hell was that? \nWALTER I'll send over a bottle of champagne. \nToni \nYou'll pick up their check. \nWALTER The voice of reason.  She's right.  I owe 'em a meal.  Hey -- here we go, Brandon, your girlfriend's going to the bathroom. \nThe GIRL glides by their table.  Heads up a flight of stairs. \nWALTER Well get moving, slick. \nBrandon \nAfter that introduction? \nWALTER Hey, I just raised the bar.  C'mon, kid.  John Anthony could close her. \nBeat.  BRANDON looks from WALTER to TONI. \nTONI I'd prefer Brandon... \nBRANDON smiles.  He walks through the restaurant, up the stairs as the WOMEN'S ROOM door opens and the GIRL emerges before him. She regards BRANDON.  Jaded, disintested air. \nBRANDON You're beautiful. \nGIRL (stepping past) \nExcuse me. \nBRANDON I just want to get to know you. \nGIRL You just want to get into my pants. \nBRANDON I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul.  I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation. \nBeat.  This could go either way before -- the GIRL smiles. \nBRANDON I'm Brandon.

MOVING CAB - NIGHT \nBRANDON and the GIRL all over each other and -- \nINT. GIRL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \n40th floor of a luxury high rise.  In the darkness, BRANDON'S seen naked on a big bed, GIRL straddling him, body rising and falling, pace quickening, back arching.  BRANDON looks up --GIRL silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows -- city spires sparkling all around and -- \nOMIT \nINT. BROWNSTONE BACK STAIRWELL - DAY \nWALTER and BRANDON reach the second floor landing, stand outside a solid steel door. \nWALTER Everything you've ever done's been leading up to this moment. Put your ear to the door.  Hear that?  It's the sound of possibilities. The din of greatness. \nWALTER turns the knob, BRANDON nearly tumbles through and -- \nINT. BROWNSTONE SECOND FLOOR - DAY \nAnother world.  A dozen SALESMEN work in a large room.  Phones ring.  FAXES churn.  Numbers are called out.  A half-dozen GIRLS stroll the space, deliver betting and tip sheets. \nWALTER We use the 800 number and free tips to bait the hook.  Then the bettors are \nbounced to our sales staff. \n(stopping at the front desk, talking to a pretty Brooklyn GIRL) \nYou're looking lovely today, Tammy.  Give it up baby, you know what I need. \nTAMMY smiles, hands WALTER a long list of names and numbers. WALTER studies the sheet as he walks BRANDON through the room. \nWALTER This is the day's phone sheet, it's a list of everyone who's called.  Only way to keep track of the action.  All leads equal money. \nBRANDON'S POV -- walking by SALESMEN doing their thing.  The first is a chain smoker, battering ram tone.  This is SOUTHIE. \nSouthie \nDid I not tell you that game was going over the total?  Now stop holding back and let's make some serious dough... \nWhat's our game plan this week?  Look, Mr. Mitch, collect from your bookie, wire our pitiful frigging share and then we'll discuss the goddamn game plan. \nThe second MAN'S HERBIE.  Slight.  Polite.  Soothing tone. \nHERBIE Trust me, we're going to turn all this around... I'm aware last weekend was difficult... Well of course I do, that's a substantial sum-- \n(cupping the phone, to WALTER) \n--He's a bit miffed about our picks \nWALTER Fuck him if he can't take a joke. \nBRANDON You're telling me that all this is legal? \nWALTER It better be.  Five of these guys are off-duty cops.  We're just advising people how to bet, not making the bets for 'em. \nC'mon, I want you to hear our best salesman, Reggie Hawks. \nREGGIE/INTO PHONE --It says here your minimum bet's five grand, so let's be honest now, can you \nmove 50 large on this game or not?...  I don't have time for this shit, Jimmy.  I \nknow you're a loser, because if you \nwere such a big winner you wouldn't have paid money to call me today.  Vegas is calling, I'm putting you on hold. \n(pressing hold) \nWhat's up big Wally, you slummin' today! \nThis the new kid? \nWALTER Brandon Lang, meet Reggie. \nREGGIE You're the QB that went off on the refs. \n(BRANDON shamefully nods) \n--Yeah, but you covered!  Shit, as much money as the refs cost us every year, that was pure.  Totally crystal.  Hell, I like you already.  Even if you did get the best office. \nWALTER (re: an item on the sports ticker) \nBarker's not playing this weekend? \nREGGIE Hamstring. \nBRANDON No, he's in the middle of renegotiating.  It's a tantrum, he'll play Sunday. \nWALTER and REGGIE exchange a glance, they can use that and -- \nANGLE ON -- TWO GLASSED-IN OFFICES overlooking the sales room. One office is crammed with clutter, bears a prominent KEEP OUT sign on the door.  Inside, a big, bearded MAN wolfs a breakfast burrito, scours the sports pages.  In the other office sits a suited, studious-looking MAN in his 30s, talking on a headset-- \n", "test1_id": 3141, "test2_input": "WALTER --Can I get the damn thing out?  I want to put John Anthony on tv this week. \nBRANDON That's me.  You mean me. \nWALTER That's right.  You, John Anthony.  You're one in the same. \nTONI Go on -- get to the good part, Walter. \nWALTER Hold on.  Before I say another word, understand -- you do this thing, Brandon, and from here out you gotta eat, sleep, shit, breathe, walk, talk and fart John \nAnthony.  It's not just a new persona. \nYou can't play it.  You gotta live it.  That's how this works. The only way it works.  You have to sell it all the way. \nTONI Think it over, Brandon, don't decide now. \nBRANDON It sounds like a promotion. \nWALTER Bet your ass it is.  Five-star. \nBRANDON --I'm in. \nTONI Well that's a thoughtful response.  Here I was, worried you'd rush your decision. \nBRANDON It's the only move.  For six years I've been living on Ramen noodles.  For the \nfirst time in a long time I've got something going.  If that means I gotta do a little acting, fine. \nWALTER Living, not acting.  You understand that as of right now Brandon Lang with his fettucini knee and his self-fucking pity is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair and John \"I-can-walk-on-fucking-water\" Anthony has taken his place? \nTONI Listen to what he's asking you, Brandon. \nWALTER She's right.  There's no going back.  I mean that.  This is gonna cost me.  I'm talking about building an empire around you.  Do you understand that? \nBRANDON ... Should I wait a little to create some tension?  Of course I understand, I'm John Fucking Anthony.  I've got the crystal ball... \nINT. TONI'S SALON - DAY \nBRANDON'S FACE FILLS SCREEN.  Scissors come in, start cutting. TONI begins bringing John Anthony to life.  BRANDON chatting her up in the chair, TONI laughing at something he says and -- \nINT. BARNEY'S MEN'S STORE - DAY \nBRANDON (new haircut) stands in private room, modeling a suit. WALTER nearby, looks through racks of clothes with a SALESMAN. \nINT. MERCEDES DEALERSHIP - DAY \nBRANDON (new haircut, new suit) walks through the showroom as WALTER talks with a DEALER. \nWALTER I need a new car for my friend. \nDEALER (to BRANDON) \nDo you have any credit? \nBRANDON No. \nDEALER Walter, do you trust him? \nWALTER With my wife naked. \nDEALER (calling to BRANDON) \nIn that case, which one do you want? \nBRANDON comes over, runs his hand over a sleek, silver SL500. \nWALTER I think he likes that one. \nEXT. SIXTH AVENUE BAR - DAY \nThe silver SL500 pulls to the curb.  License plate reading \"900 KING.\"  A pair of $500 shoes emerge.  BRANDON stands on the sidewalk as the DOORMAN comes up, eyes the car. \nDoorman \nI'll watch it for you. \n(seeing the license plate) \nWhat's \"900 King?\" \nBRANDON (handing him a card) \nI don't lose. \nBRANDON heads into the bar, meets WALTER and a group of HEAVY HITTERS outside.

WALTER sees. \n", "test2_true": "BRANDON I'm scared shitless. \nWALTER Don't worry about your lines, it's all scripted.  You've been here before, kid, just think of it like a football game. \nBRANDON This is different. \nWALTER How? \nBRANDON There's no opponent. \nWALTER Perfect, then you're a lock to win. \nINT. TV PRODUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA TRACKS to a talk show-like set dominated by a triangular table, three chairs and a backdrop bearing a sports-themed logo and the words - THE SPORTS ADVISORS.  BRANDON sits between WALTER and JERRY, increasingly nervous as the CAMERAS push close.  CHUCK arrives, loud suit, takes a seat at the end of the table, head down, averting eye contact with everyone. \nTECH 30 seconds.  Walter, we're not getting your audio. \nWALTER (fumbling with a clipped on mike) \nSomething's wrong here. \nJERRY (leaning over, plugging in a wire) \nYour lead's loose, I got it.  I'm talking to the tech guys about going wireless. \nJERRY looks at BRANDON, staring anxiously at the teleprompter. \nJERRY John Anthony, huh?  All I see's another wannabee in a 1000-dollar suit.  Word to \nthe wise, save the clothes you came in. \nTECH Five, four, three, two, one-- \n(NOTE: WALTER and the PANEL follow text from a teleprompter.) \nWALTER Welcome to this week's edition of The Sports Advisors!  America's premier sports information program with myself, Walter Abrams, Jerry Sykes, Chuck Adler  and a truly gifted newcomer to the Sports Advisor panel, a substantial find -- John Anthony!  We're entering week six in pro football!  This is when the cream rises to the top!  This is when things get hot!  It's oven mitt time! This is big-time ball season so let's get right into it with the Wizard of Odds -- Jerry \"The Source\" Sykes!  Jerry, what's the Sykes System predicting for this weekend? \nJERRY Walter, my patented computer models tell me we're looking at nothing less than the perfect storm of betting opportunities. But first, last week I cashed in a big-time call on on Chicago as an outright winner over Indianapolis -- making it my 8th straight top selection winner right here on this tv show!  This Sunday I have 5 match-ups I absolutely love, including Miami at New York!  Stats, rankings, records, weather, the Sykes System uses 42 proven indexs to eliminate the guesswork from sports wagering. Without my patented, computer-based picks you have a better chance of seeing God knocking on your door with five strippers and a bag of Bolivian cocaine than winning on your own!  Call me for my five games!  Absolutely free -- 800-238-6648! \nWALTER Our experts know how to read between the lines, we know how to analyze a point spread, we're not pulling rabbits out of \na hat here.  Certainly not Chuck Adler -- \n(turning to CHUCK) \nChuck, you'd probably eat that rabbit if you got your hands on it. \nCHUCK (coming suddenly, wildly alive) \nHell yes -- with a side order of fried bookmaker!!!  I'm the grim reaper of bookmakers!  I've put more bookies out of business than the I.R.S.!  How many gamblers did I bail out last weekend with my game of the year!  Denver, a 10- \npoint underdog beating Cincinatti by two touchdowns!  A $100 bettor made $10,000! \nCHUCK CON'D A $500 bettor made $50,000!  I've got six games on Sunday I'm releasing absolutely free!  These games are a burial!  A blow-out! A human lock!  You can bet your children's unborn children's children on these six games -- ABSOLUTELY FREE!!! \nWALTER (finger in his ear) \nHoly Christ, I forgot my earplugs.  Take a break before you blow a gasket, we'll get back to you after my hearing returns.  Saturday comes before Sunday and looking at this Saturday's college match-ups is the last but certainly not least member of The Sports Advisors -- John Anthony! \nBRANDON (reading off the teleprompter) \n--John Anthony here, the Million Dollar Man with the billion dollar plan!  From Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood, all your big money stays and plays with me! \n(beat, processing this, suddenly going off the teleprompter script) \n--Someone wrote some great stuff for me here but the \"Million Dollar Man,\" I dunno, it sounds kinda small somehow.  I mean maybe if you change that M in million to a Z I could get behind it.  They tried all sorts of names, wanted to call me the Magic Man -- but picking 80 percent winners sounds pretty scientific to me.  So let's just call me John.  I was a quarterback.  And every QB knows the key to victory is anticipating -- the ability to see the future and react to it.  That is what I do, that's the truth, and what do they say about the truth, Walter? \nWALTER ... It bites you on the ass? \nBRANDON Not in my case.  You tell us, Jerry. \nJERRY It sets you free? \nBRANDON That's right, but with me it makes you M-O-N-EE!  I'm picking 80 percent, is that \nunbelievable?  Well it used to be.  I know the leagues!  I know the players!  I \nBRANDON CON'D know the game!  I'm your friend on the field!  Your insider on the outside!  You can't do what I do if you haven't been there! Played at the level I have!  Maybe you'll get lucky -- guess right once in a while -- but these match- ups won't be called consistently by anything other than experience!  Forget trends! Throw out every system you possess!  Keep your friends but toss their opinions out the window!  It's time to change I-would-if-I-could to I-can-and-I-am!  You wanna know who I like -- call that little number at the bottom of your screen! \nBRANDON continues.  CAMERA on WALTER, watching proudly and -- \nINT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nWALTER walks down the dim hall, looks in on JULIA, sleeping. \nINT. WALTER AND TONI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDim darkness.  Silence.  Then someone bumps into something. Muffled curse.  A light goes on.  TONI sits up in bed, sees WALTER fully dressed, across the room, holding his shoes. \nWALTER I'm not here.  Go back to sleep. \nTONI It's four in the morning. \n", "test2_id": 3142, "test3_input": "BRANDON That's a really scary thought. \nWALTER If not me, then pick someone else.  It's all in your head!  The shit that happened to you, to Toni, to me -- you know what it is?  Just that, shit that happened. \nWALTER CON'D It's not who we are.  After \nWalter con'd \nall the therapy and the analysis and the meetings and the -- aaahhhh! -- the one thing I know-- \n(yelling to the sky) \n--WE'RE ALL FUCKED UP!  We are all just so fucked up! \n(to BRANDON) \nSay it!  Shout it!  Come on, you two -- wallow with me here! \nA MAN sticks his head out a window down the street, yells -- \nMAN I'm trying to sleep, asshole! \nWALTER Dad!  Is that you? \nMAN I'll crush you like a beetle! \nWALTER How's Mom?! \nMAN Fucking freak! \nWALTER I love you too!  Don't wait up! \nWALTER, TONI and BRANDON all laugh.  The three of them doubled over on the dark, deserted street.  MAN screaming from above. The ring of a phone begins bleeding in and -- \nINT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY \nNew furniture and sports photos on the walls suggest the passage of time.  BRANDON stands before a mirror, being fitted for a suit by a TAILOR.  He has a cigar in one hand, Coke in the other, talks into a headset as he watches the TAILOR work. \nBRANDON Are you serious, Amir?  You gonna fucking haggle with me over a measly 50 thousand on the 250 grand I won you this weekend? \nEXT. AMIR'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY \nAMIR (sharply attired) stands outside his business, leaning against a brand new, red Ferrari as he talks on the phone. \nAMIR Don't get me wrong, John.  I'm thankful, very much, you're amazing, it's just that 50 thousand seems slightly steep-- \nBRANDON --The first time you call me you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon, you're crying about hocking your fiance's ring and this weekend you're phoning me from a suite at the Bellagio that I put you in -- you know what -- I'm cutting you off... You want to continue with me, I'm tagging on a 10 percent aggravation tax!  Now get to Western Union and shoot me 75 grand by tonight and we'll kiss and make up. \n(hanging up, to the TAILOR) \nNo cuff. \n(the phone rings, picking up--) \nJohn Fucking Anthony, talk to me. \nWOMAN VOICEOVER This is... May I please speak to a Brandon Lang? \nBRANDON ... Mom? \nINT. BRANDON'S VEGAS HOME - DAY \nBRANDON'S MOM drinking coffee, talking on the phone \nBRANDON'S MOTHER Brandon, is that you? \nBRANDON VOICEOVER That's me. \nINTERCUT BRANDON'S MOTHER Are you okay? \nBRANDON Never better.  Kicking ass and taking names.  Did you get the money I sent? \nBRANDON'S MOTHER Well that's why I'm calling, honey. \nBRANDON Good good good.  I talked to Denny.  Next month I'm flying you and him out here.  First class.  I'll put you up at The Plaza. You'll love this joint. \nBRANDON'S MOTHER It sounds great, Brandon, but the money -- it's too much.  Where did you get it? \nBRANDON I made it.  Earned it.  Every fucking cent.  Put it in Denny's college fund. \nBRANDON'S MOTHER Listen to you. \nBRANDON It's just how people talk here. \n(looking down at the TAILOR, edge) \nHow many times I gotta say no cuff? \nBRANDON'S MOTHER Who's this John Anthony person? \nBRANDON He's me.  I'm him. \nBRANDON'S MOTHER And he talks like that? \nBRANDON He's pretty fucking salty -- geez, I'm sorry, Mom -- I mean yeah. Look, the main point is I'm learning a lot here. \n", "test3_true": "BRANDON I appreciate the concern, Ma, but the checks I've been sending -- the checks you've been cashing -- those are from John Anthony. \nBRANDON'S MOTHER Funny, I thought they were from my son. \nWALTER enters, slaps an airline ticket on his desk. \nWALTER We're going to Puerto Rico! \nBRANDON Gotta put you on hold, Ma. \n(pressing a button on the headset) \nWhat's in Puerto Rico? \nWALTER Since Ricky Martin moved out, all that's left are tourists, cruise ships and C.M. Novian -- one of the biggest sports bettors in the world.  He just called.  Wants to meet you in person!  To-day! Flight leaves Laguardia in 45 minutes. \nBRANDON (activating the headset) \nI gotta go, Ma... Ma... Son of a bitch --  my own fucking mother hung up on me! \nEXT. SAN JUAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT \nAn AIRLINER roars in for landing. \nINT. AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT \nWALTER and BRANDON pass through FRAME. \nBRANDON What do you know about him? \nWALTER Not much, 'cept for the fact he's a world class prick.  Bastard treated me worse than my Hong Kong tailor.  Never once returned a call.  I've been trying to bag this guy for years.  Do you have any idea what this is worth? \nBRANDON No, but I want a bonus if we pull it off. \nWALTER Look at me.  There is no if -- it's only when.  This time he called us, remember?  You hooked him.  Know that.  Sweat that. \nBRANDON Relax, I'll get in character in the car. \nWALTER suddenly slows, winces.  He angles toward a bathroom. \nBRANDON ... Walter? \nWALTER grabs for a water fountain, misses, suddenly collapses. \nBRANDON Your vial -- where's your pills, Walter? \nWALTER finds the vial, pops it, his chest heaves and the pills spill on the floor.  WALTER looks wide-eyed up at BRANDON, mouths \"Big one.\"  BRANDON frantically loosens WALTER'S shirt.  A crowd gathers.  A BUSINESSMAN pulls a cell phone, dials 911. \nBRANDON Hold on, Walter we're getting help!  Oh my God.  Listen to me. Walter -- Walter.  You're gonna be fine.  Hold on! \n(to the CROWD) \nWe need a doctor!  Is there a doctor? \nWALTER Brandon -- \nBRANDON Save your strength.  Help's coming.  Help's coming. \nWALTER ...

Now don't talk. \n(turning to the CROWD) \nWe need a doctor! \nSeveral stunned ONLOOKERS run for help.  WALTER fading fast. \nWALTER I believe you.  I believe you love me.  I love you too... Just one thing -- \nBRANDON Save your strength, Walter. \nWALTER ... Would you love me if this was a joke? \nBRANDON What? \nWALTER I'm fine.  Just practicing... \nWALTER smiles.  Stands.  Brushes himself off.  To the CROWD -- \nWALTER I'm okay!  Little gas.  Must've had too many peanuts on the plane. \nThe confused ONLOOKERS drift away. \nBRANDON You sick fucking fuck!

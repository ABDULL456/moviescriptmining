{"train": "TWO FOR THE MONEY \nWritten by \nDan Gilroy \nFinal Draft: 10-29-04 \nEXT. HOME MOVIE - 1982 - DAY \nA DAD tosses a baseball to his SON.  The boy swings, connects, sends the ball flying.  DAD smiles. \nBRANDON LANG'S VOICE That's me.  Five years old.  I remember that day.  Believe it or not, I remember that hit.  I remember it because of the smile that spread over my dad's face... \nEXT. HOME MOVIE - 1983 - DAY \nBRANDON shooting hoops.  DAD drinks a Bud, frowns as he misses. \nBRANDON VOICEOVER I would've stood there all day to sink one.  Just to see that smile... \nEXT. HOME MOVIE - 1984 - DAY \nBRANDON runs, wears a too-big helmet and pads.  A DOG chases him as DAD throws a football -- long pass -- TIME SLOWS and -- \nBRANDON VOICEOVER To pop, sports were a religion.  To me, it was about purity, a place where all wrongs could be made right, or at least temporarily forgotten.  I was going to fill the whole house with trophies for him.  There was no doubt in my mind, I was going to make him happy... \nBRANDON catches the ball.  Blinding light, loud CHEERING and \nEXT. STADIUM - 1999 - NIGHT \nOur eyes adjust to see we're in a STADIUM.  It's a night game. Stands packed.  A PLAY CLOCK fills the SCREEN.  It's the fourth quarter.  Seven seconds left.  Score:  CAL WEST 31 / SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY 27.  A bruised and battered UNLV QUARTERBACK gets a play from the COACH, straps on his helmet as he runs back to the huddle.  The name on the QUARTERBACK'S jersey -- B. LANG. 10 exhausted, desperate faces come close, hang on BRANDON'S every word -- \nBRANDON Last play.  Slant red, right back on two.  On two, Scottie. It's a lock.  A guaranteed TD.  I've already seen it.  So relax. There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear any \"Hi moms.\"  Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me.  See you in the end zone. \nThe teams breaks, approaches the line.  Loud CROWD roar. \nBRANDON VOICEOVER I'd been a quarterback since pee-wee football.  Set high school records.  Won state championships.  I wasn't driven by joy, it wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple -- fear of losing. \nTV ANNOUNCERS South West Nevada needs a score.  Seven seconds on the clock. 22 yard line.  Win or lose, this has been a spectacular season for Lang.  The big question, should he turn pro now or wait until -- Lang's got the snap-- \nBRANDON drops back.  A GIANT gets a hand on BRANDON'S jersey. BRANDON pulls free, runs.  OPPONENTS charge his way, BRANDON vaults, sails in the end zone, SCORES.  BRANDON rolls on his back as an OPPOSING PLAYER hurtles in -- mid-air -- unable to stop as -- 300-plus pounds come crashing onto BRANDON'S leg. Sickening sound.  BRANDON clutches his strangely angled limb. \nBRANDON VOICEOVER ... My first thought was I can tape it and play next week.  Then I puked. \nTEAMMATES surround BRANDON, many turning from the sight and -- \nINT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nBRANDON'S wheeled in. \nINT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT \nSURGEONS regard the leg.  IVs are hooked up. \nBRANDON What's the rehab time? \nThe SURGEONS talk between themselves, impressed by the break. \nBRANDON When do I play again? \nOne DOCTOR examines his x-rays.  BRANDON grabs his smock. \nBRANDON The patient's got a question! \nAnesthetic haze.  A wavy world is melting far, far away. \nSURGEON VOICEOVER Football's done, son... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nBRANDON'S in a hospital bed.  Big leg cast.  IV's in each arm. \nMAN'S VOICE Brandon... Brandon, it's me. \nBRANDON opens his eyes, focuses on his FATHER (older, cheap suit, beard stubble, clutching a $2 bouquet of flowers). \nBRANDON'S DAD You okay?  I saw what happened on the tv.  Helluva thing that happening like that. \nBRANDON (edge) \nWhat are you doing here? \nBRANDON'S DAD I brought some flowers.  From downstairs in the shop. \nBRANDON (pressing the nurse's call button) \nNo, you gotta go -- where's the nurse? \nBRANDON'S DAD I'm thinking of getting into a new program, Brandon. \nA NURSE comes fast through the door, watches unsure -- \nBRANDON Could you get him out, please? \nBRANDON'S DAD It's okay, we're fine, I'm his father. \nBRANDON --You've reached the Jessica Simpson hot line!  Jessica's going to tell you all about Nick's surprise birthday party and her rockin' new panty line at Wal-Mart, but first, here's a little fan trivia to win a VIP Gold Package back stage pass to Jessica's Omnicon Hotels Summer Tour-- \nA bull-like BOSS appears at BRANDON'S cubicle entry -- \nBOSS Got a job for you, Lang. \nBRANDON I'm in the middle of taping. \nBOSS Bauer's sick, can't update his betting line.  You know anything 'bout sports? \nBRANDON ... Yeah, a little. \nINT. NEIGHBORING CUBICLE - OFFICE - MINUTE LATER \nBRANDON enters a co-worker's cluttered cubicle. \nBRANDON VOICEOVER 900 numbers, audio text, the racket had a lot of names. \nBrandon sits at his co-worker's desk.  He picks up the text copy sitting beside the recording device, looks it over -- \nBRANDON VOICEOVER This guy's gig was sports handicapping.  Predicting winners for people who bet.  I was supposed to just record his picks. \nThe thing was, I didn't agree with them. \nBrandon starts changing game selections, re-writing the copy. \nBRANDON VOICEOVER My picks went 9-and-1 that weekend.  By football season, the job was mine... \nINT. BRANDON'S NEW CUBICLE - SEVERAL MONTHS LATER - DAY \nA football is seen, rising and falling from BRANDON'S cubicle. He tosses the football as he records a new update -- \nBRANDON --Kansas City is 7-1 against the point spread versus division opponents coming off a Monday night game.  Take K.C. minus the six points.  Call tomorrow for my pro football game of the year -- Tampa Bay versus Oakland.  That's 900-656-3100.  This is Brandon Lang saying good night and good luck everybody. \nBRANDON pops the tape.  Dons an old UNLV windbreaker.  He shoulders a beat-up bike, walks up front, hands the tape to his BOSS. BOSS hands back a paycheck.  Regarding the amount -- \nBRANDON I went 9-2 in pro football Sunday and hit my third straight Monday night parlay. \nBOSS That's what you get paid for. \nBRANDON I want a raise to 12 bucks an hour. \nBOSS I don't make 12 an hour. \nBRANDON You're not picking 75 percent. \nBOSS If you're so good then bet your own games, get rich and send me a postcard \nfrom the Riviera. \nBOSS pops BRANDON'S tape in a multi-line answering system and-- \nEXT. LAS VEGAS - DAY \nBRANDON rides a beat-up bike through downtown. \nINT. CASINO - DAY \nBRANDON maneuvers through a bustling casino, enters the SPORTS BETTING ROOM.  He goes to a rack of printed bettling lines for the weekend games, pockets a printed sheet, sees a SUPERVISOR. \nBRANDON Hey Stu, where's the action this weekend? \nSUPERVISOR/STU We're getting big money on Tampa/Oakland.  Everyone's jumping on Tampa Bay. \nBRANDON Crazy. \nSupervisor/stu \nYou think? \nBRANDON That game's gonna be won by coaching, Stu.  Gruden put that Tampa Bay team together before he came to Oakland, right?  He knows every weakness of that team and every strength.  He knows Brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him double-teamed to the right.  He knows Gannon always throws on a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field.  Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday. \n(STU staring at him, pained look) \n...You got sucked into Tampa, didn't you? \n(STU manages a nod) \nStu, how many times do I have to bail you out?  All right, listen, forget the point spread.  Oakland's going to win outright.  Bet the money line and bet big. \nSTU Thanks, B. \nOMIT \nEXT. BRANDON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBRANDON rides up.  His younger brother, DENNY (18, Metallica t-shirt) and some FRIENDS work on an old, bondo-pocked muscle car in the garage. \nDENNY I scrounged some old headers, B!  Check it out! \nDENNY turns the key.  The car rumbles to life.  He revs the bored-out engine, flashes a shit eating grin. \nBRANDON ... Awesome dude.  That's a righteous ride, Denny. \nINT. BRANDON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWALTER VO Run the numbers, do the math.  Hold on a sec-- \nMuzak.  BRANDON juggles the phone, searching, finds a pay stub. Amount: $275.00 a week.  BRANDON crosses it out, writes $1000. He crosses that out, writes $1500.  BRANDON pulls a quarter, flips it.  The coin bounces, spins, falls and-- \nEXT. JFK MOVING WALKWAY - DAY \nBRANDON hefts a duffel bag -- sees an ASIAN DRIVER, chauffeur uniform, mirrored shades, holding a sign reading B. LANG and \nINT. MOVING LIMO - DAY \nBRANDON eyes a basket of croissants and juice, grabs a danish, takes a bite, sees the DRIVER watching in the mirror. \nBRANDON I'm gonna pay.  I'll pay you-- \nDRIVER --Pay me?  Pay Walter.  His car.  I'm Milton, I drive for him. \nBRANDON I thought it was a service. \n(moving to the jump seat, seeing MILTON is driving very fast) \nSo what's the deal with this guy?  You work for him a long time? \nMILTON Oh yeah, going on two weeks. \n(off BRANDON'S look) \nI was bike messenger.  Walter's driver hit me with his car. I lie on ground, make it look worse than is, big car, you \nknow maybe get some money.  Driver call me name, I call him name, he take swing -- big son of a bitch -- so I kick his ass. \n(slicing the air with his hands) \nWalter get out.  I say his driver can't drive, he say you're right.  I say damn right.  He ask if I can, I say hell yeah. He take hat off driver, give it to me. \nEvery day with Walter is... \nEXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS BROWNSTONE - DAY \nFive stories.  Next to the Brooklyn Bridge.  Manhattan rises across the East River.  The limo pulls up.  BRANDON steps out, regards the structure.  Exhaust fans dot the second floor.  Satellite dishes on the roof.  Security cameras everywhere. \nINT. BROWNSTONE - TOP FLOOR - DAY \nBRANDON follows MILTON through a large, wildly furnished apartment. They pass an large library dominated by rows of bleacher seats from the old Polo Grounds.  A hot dog stand sits outside a wine cellar.  Toys tell us there's a child in the house.  A cha-cha plays from a stereo.  MILTON stops at a set of doors.  About to knock when -- \nWALTER VO \nBring him in! \nINT. WALTER ABRAMS' OFFICE - DAY \nWALTER smokes a cigarette, talking on the phone as an ASSISTANT in a separate, adjoining space handles four ringing phones. Across the room, a large wall is filled with TVS, each turned to a different channel, no sound. \nWALTER I'll hire the trainers too... Well run it by them, you won't know until you try... So, they can stay the night.  I'll put 'em up at the Plaza, nice suite, park view... Okay double it... Triple it... Everything's about money.  Look, on Sunday, my daughter, an angel, turns six, it's not likely to happen again.  She \nloves elephants.  Your circus has 10, \nI only want one, my little girl's happiness is in your hands. \n(beat, icy edge) \nI don't need parenting advice from a guy \nwho doubles as a clown.  I want an \nelephant and I'll pay.  What'll it take to grease your wheels and get one this weekend?  Hello?... Hello?\"  Fuck wad! \n(intercom his ASSISTANT, furious) \nFind Ringling Brothers!  Get me on the horn with someone who understands profit! \nWALTER sees BRANDON.  Something new.  Full focus.  He removes the headset.  Dons his glasses.  Circles around. \nWALTER Whoa, look at you.  The Marlboro man. \n(feeling his bicep) \nJesus you're in great shape. \nBRANDON I've been in better. \nWALTER (assessing BRANDON as he speaks--) \nModesty's not a virtue, it's a vice, as evil as vanity.  There are rules to \nsuccess, Brandon, and this is rule number one, know what you know and know what you don't know and know I gotta know  everything you know as soon as you know it, if not sooner!  Smile.  C'mon! What the hell is that?  I said smile.  Bigger.  Hungrier.  More teeth.  Ever sell before? \nBRANDON No. \nWALTER If you can sell you'll never starve.  Ever speak in public? Perform?  Anything like that? \nBRANDON I played quarterback in college.  Division one. \nWALTER I know, I'm talking about not in uniform. \nBRANDON I used to sing at church. \nWOMAN Easy for you to say.  You used to model. \nThe other WOMEN CUSTOMERS listening nearby nod in agreement. \nTONI Oh yeah, that's true.  Those were the good days.  Sometimes I like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos and reminisce about rehab. \nWOMAN Tightly wound today, aren't we? \nTONI I guess.  Must be the coffee talking. \n(handing her a fashion magazine) \nHere, read a fashion magazine.  Feel more insecure about yourself. \nTONI walks through the shop, checks her watch, passes a row of WOMEN getting lunch-hour nail jobs.  BRANDON'S squeezed in among them.  Only guy there.  Cotton between his toes post-pedicure. Hunched and uncomfortable as the WOMEN around him discuss boyfriends and relationships. \nTONI ... Brandon? \nBRANDON Hi. \nTONI I'm Toni.  Walter said you'd stop by. \nBRANDON Nice to meet you. \n(immediately, re: the pedicure) \nThis was his idea. \nTONI I know. \nBRANDON He makes all his employees do this? \nTONI Every one. \nBRANDON How often? \nTONI Once.  Before they start work. \nBRANDON Weird. \nTONI You think? \nBRANDON I've never had my nails done before. \nTONI I can see that. \n(putting his hands in water) \nStrong hands.  Nice.  Do you drink? \nBRANDON No thanks.  I'm fine. \nTONI No, do you drink? \nBRANDON Excuse me? \nTONI Alcohol.  Are you a drinker? \nBRANDON I've been pretty focused on staying in shape.  I mean a beer once in a while. \nTONI Smoke? \nBRANDON No. \nToni \nWhat about gambling? \nBRANDON What about it? \nTONI Look, I'm sorry, I'm pressed for time. \n(stopping work, regarding him) \nI asked do you bet.  Are you a bettor? \nBRANDON No. \nTONI Really?  Why not? \nBRANDON meets her gaze.  Gears turning.  She's hitting on him. \nBRANDON Toni, huh?  Are you here full-time? \nTONI It's my shop, I better be.  Why don't you gamble? \nBRANDON Well I'll tell you, Toni.  I bet on something once.  Risked everything I had and lost. \nTONI So? \nBRANDON I swore I'd never do it again. \nToni \nYou're sticking to that story? \nBRANDON back at the mike.  Groping for a delivery. \nBRANDON John Anthony here, ready to make all your betting dreams come true!  Call now and let me win for you!  The point spread in the Indiana/Michigan game's up to four, making that game a gimme-- \nINT. BROWNSTONE - WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY \nAnother CD sails out.  WALTER staring at BRANDON -- \nWALTER What is that shit?  You spent 6 years bouncing from one dead-end job to another.  Riding to work on a frigging bicycle.  Were you making some kind of statement?  What the hell were you afraid of? \nBRANDON I wasn't afraid of anything.  I was working my ass off, trying to get back in the game. \nWALTER You are back in the game!  Convince me you belong here! \nINT. BROWNSTONE - DOWNSTAIRS GYM - NIGHT \nBRANDON pumping it out.  Music pounds on a stereo.  BRANDON watches himself in the mirror, muscles straining.  He suddenly slams the bar down, goes down the hall, grabs the mike, reads from the copy and -- \nBRANDON This is John Anthony here, and from Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood, all your big money stays and plays with me!  Winning consistently's the name of this game and I always remain the same, winners on a consistent basis, 77 percent winners!  So sit back and relax because \nbecause it's a scud attack this weekend and I'm shelling your bookmaker! \nINT. BROWNSTONE - DAY \nBRANDON bounding up to WALTER'S office. \nBRANDON VOICEOVER Game one of my three-team parlay is  Michigan hosting Indiana; the big boys at Michigan are just 2-7 against the spread as a double-digit home favorite and with arch rival Wisconsin on deck next week, Indiana will catch them looking ahead!  Take Indiana plus the 16 points!  It's a lock! \nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY \nWALTER listening to the CD.  BRANDON watching him. \nBRANDON VOICEOVER You want more?  John Anthony's the man with a plan to make you money!  Game two goes to Florida and North Carolina!  I don't care how many points you gotta lay with Florida, lay it!  They'll win by 50! \nWALTER pops the CD, heads for the window. \nBRANDON C'mon!  First too little, then too much -- \nWALTER It's a start. \nBRANDON Tell me what you want. \nWALTER No.  What do you want, Brandon?  That's what this is about! \nWALTER stops.  Steadies himself.  He pulls a prescription vial. Sits.  Passing, pained look. \nBRANDON Walter?  Are you okay? \nWALTER ... Huh?... It's nothing. \n(popping a pill from the vial, beat, taking another) \n... Small one. \nBRANDON Should I call someone? \nWALTER Not unless they got a spare heart.  I'm okay. \nWALTER finds a cigarette.  Lights it.  Savors the first drag. \nBRANDON What are you doing? \nWALTER Courage wants to laugh. \nEXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING \nBRANDON riding his bike hard across the Brooklyn Bridge.   Wearing earphones while he listens to a radio sports show. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER/keith jackson vO \n--Talking about college defenses you have to include Oklahoma. The Okie boys are 2nd-ranked going into this weekend and facing an offensive powerhouse in Oregon. \nThat game and more coming up after the break. \nA commerical's heard as BRANDON pedals away, glances up and --surreal sight -- Brandon hurtling at an ELEPHANT'S ASS -- he swerves -- looks back at the TRAINER walking the pachyderm across the city span and -- \nINT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - DAY \nA TV SCREEN FILLS FRAME.  A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME starts. ANNOUNCERS riff a MEDLEY of analysis and scores. \nPULL BACK TO SHOW -- BRANDON comes out of the shower, towel around his waist, putting on a clean shirt.  Through a ground floor window the boardwalk can be seen.  A child's party is in progress. The elephant ambles by wearing a birthday hat, the bemused TRAINER walking beside him.  TONI and WALTER are seen arm-in-arm with their 6-year-old daughter, JULIA.  WALTER crosses the lawn, looks through the window. \nBRANDON'S switching between football games blaring from the tv. A radio blasts scores and updates.  WALTER knocks on the window, mouths \"How we doing?\"  BRANDON grabs a betting sheet, writes something, holds it up -- 0 and 9.  WALTER scowls.  BRANDON realizes it's upside down, flips it to read -- 6 and 0.  WALTER kisses the glass and -- \nEXT. BROWNSTONE - SAME TIME - DAY \nWALTER catches up to TONI, walks through the party with her. \nWALTER He's a machine, all he does is work out and pick winners.  Talk about fit.  Go  take a peek, see him with his shirt off.  I did. He's a serious side of beef. \nTONI Enjoy your daughter's party. \nWALTER Check him out, you know you want to. \nTONI Get out of your head, Walter.  It's a bad neighborhood. \nWALTER Yeah, I can tell.  Don't be.  Ever.  One week's over, another begins.  The past is merely a prologue.  In this job you have to push the envelope every day. \nBRANDON glances at a nearby table, catches the eye of a stunning GIRL sandwiched between two middle-aged, overweight MEN.  WALTER catches the eye contact before she looks away.  The GIRL seems bored as the two big men heartily chow down. \nWALTER Look at that.  Beauty and the beasts.  What do you think of her, Brandon? \nBRANDON She's cute. \nWALTER Cute doesn't half cover it.  The girl's gorgeous.  And bored out of her mind.  Waiting for some young buck to save her from those two gorillas.  Check it out.  She's eyeing you again, Brandon. \nBRANDON So are the two guys she's with. \nWALTER I'll bet you 10-to-1 on a 1000 you can't pick her up, cash, if you leave with her. \nToni \nC'mon Walter.  You might as well go to Atlantic City and open a house account.  You know you can't gamble. \nWALTER Who's gambling?  It's a challenge.  If Brandon leaves with her I give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he made last year.  If not, he gives me a grand, which I'll give to you. \nBRANDON I don't bet, Walter. \n(glancing over, look from the GIRL) \n... But I do love a challenge. \nWALTER All right.  Before you bust a move, just one thing... \n(talks across the table, addressing the MODEL and the two MEN) \nExcuse me, I don't mean to interrupt but \nWalter con'd \nI have to know what's going on here. \nYou're drop dead gorgeous and your dates \nlook like they haven't missed a meal \nsince Christ died.  Seriously, you \ntwo are eating like you have a date \nwith the electric chair.  What's the story with you three?  I'm not gonna sleep if I don't know.  Lemme guess.  Garment district. The Hardy boys make lingerie and you're a model.  That \nit?  Close?  Sprechenzee English?  Sit down, sit down -- I'm just joking.  I better stop before I get stabbed with a fork. Bon apetit. \n(turning back, TONI staring at him) \nTONI What the hell was that? \nWALTER I'll send over a bottle of champagne. \nToni \nYou'll pick up their check. \nWALTER The voice of reason.  She's right.  I owe 'em a meal.  Hey -- here we go, Brandon, your girlfriend's going to the bathroom. \nThe GIRL glides by their table.  Heads up a flight of stairs. \nWALTER Well get moving, slick. \nBrandon \nAfter that introduction? \nWALTER Hey, I just raised the bar.  C'mon, kid.  John Anthony could close her. \nBeat.  BRANDON looks from WALTER to TONI. \nTONI I'd prefer Brandon... \nBRANDON smiles.  He walks through the restaurant, up the stairs as the WOMEN'S ROOM door opens and the GIRL emerges before him. She regards BRANDON.  Jaded, disintested air. \nBRANDON You're beautiful. \nGIRL (stepping past) \nExcuse me. \nBRANDON I just want to get to know you. \nGIRL You just want to get into my pants. \nBRANDON I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul.  I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation. \nBeat.  This could go either way before -- the GIRL smiles. \nBRANDON I'm Brandon.  What's your name? \nGIRl \nAlex. \nINT. OFFICE OVERLOOKING SALES ROOM - SAME TIME - DAY \nJERRY SYKES types stats into a computer as he fields a call. Three other computer screens flash football info and data. Large, complex wall graphs chart esoteric team trends.  A framed promotional picture shows JERRY standing in a bank vault, the banner type below reading \"Jerry 'The Source' Sykes, Creator of The Sykes Sports Wagering System.\" \nJERRY (typing on a computer as he speaks) \n--I know it's a new stadium, I'm asking if they used Astroturf or Astroplay?... Astroplay, it has a rubber silica base, like ground up tires... Look, I don't have time to explain abrasion indexes and resistance scales to you, trust me, it makes a big fucking difference... \n(looking through the glass, seeing WALTER showing BRANDON around) \nSo bribe a security guard, sneak in with the grounds crew, do what you have to -- this is what I pay you for. \nINT. ENCLOSED OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY \nWALTER and BRANDON enter.  It's spacious.  Nicely appointed. A glass partition overlooks the sales room. \nWALTER I had three guys who picked games.  I fired one last weekend. I'm giving you his job.  This is your office.  From here  out your picks are going straight to our biggest customers.  How do you like it? \nBRANDON What's not to like? \nJERRY SYKES appears at the door.  Fast glance at BRANDON, attention to WALTER -- \nJERRY The Miami/New York point spread shifted a half tick up to 10. \nWALTER What do you think? \nJERRY Miami's still a lock.  The win/loss ratios and RPI ratings are off the charts.  I'm keeping it on my sheet. \nWALTER Jerry's our top handicapper, came to me straight out of grad school.  Jerry, meet the new kid in town. \nJERRY Whoa, phone guy makes good.  Big jump from the 900 numbers. Watch out you don't get a nose bleed.  Just kidding, best of luck, I gotta get back to work. \nBRANDON Pleasure meeting you.  By the way, Jerry, New York's gonna win straight up.  They always play the fish tight.  Tonight it's foregone, they win outright. \nJERRY Really?  Listen up, stick to college, sonny.  You have to work up to pro ball around here.  Nice try though. \nWALTER (watching JERRY walk away) \nI got three guys who can handicap and 20 who can sell but I never had one who could do both, not really, not until now. \nBRANDON You mean me? \nWALTER Not you.  John Anthony. \nBRANDON John Anthony doesn't exist. \nWALTER That's a shock 'cause I'm standing in his office and you're sitting in his chair! \nBRANDON Look, making predictions is one thing -- but pushing people to bet, it's not me. \nWALTER Pushing people?  Get real, this country was built on gambling. Look at Wall Street -- one big casino.  The state spends millions hawking the lottery.  If people want to pay for advice on who to bet, who are we to say no?  Stop being selfish, spread the word!  Check your bible, Brandon, tis better to give than receive. \nBRANDON You got a whole room full of salesmen. \nWALTER Big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to speak to the guy making the picks -- and you're picking 80 percent winners. \nWALTER CON'D What's the matter?  Gonna lose your purity?  C'mon, what do you think selling is?  We're just talking a few well-timed phrases. Let's start with an easy one.  A throw-away.  \"I don't want your money, I want your bookie's fucking money?\" \nBRANDON I don't want your money -- \nWALTER --Jesus, don't start that shit again.  Sell me. \nBRANDON I don't want your money, I want your bookie's money! \nWALTER What happened to the fuck? \nBRANDON Nothing, I just don't talk like that. \nWALTER I can't have someone working for me who can't say fuck. \nBRANDON It's not that I can't.  Why do I have to? \nWALTER Because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can.  Fuck is your friend.  Fuck can be your best friend. \nBRANDON I'm happy for you and your friend, Walter, but I'm not using it. \nWALTER Chaucer used it 600 years ago.  It was good enough for him. C'mon-- \n(calling out to the SALESMEN) \n--this fucking guy has a problem saying fuck! \nA chorus of \"Fuck yous\" fill the air. \nWALTER C'mon, repeat after me -- fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.  Fuck he, fuck she, fuck me, fuck them, fuck me -- try it. \nBRANDON It's not me.  Let it go. \nWALTER Backbone.  Almost as good.  We'll keep working on the other thing... So, you really like New York in tonight's game? \nEXT. MANHATTAN - MID-DAY \nLooking down Fifth.  Thousands of heads in a hurry to get somewhere. Here comes BRANDON and WALTER. \nBRANDON Where are we going? \nCongratulations. \nBRANDON I'm picking now with you and Jerry. \nCHUCK (ducking back into his office) \nWhatever. \nThe MAN shuts the door, leaves BRANDON looking at the KEEP OUT sign.  SOUTHIE stops for a coffee, has seen the exchange. \nSOUTHIE Don't take it personal.  Chuck's got a condition, get's anxious around people. \nCHUCK closes his blinds, blocks out his glassed-in walls and-- \nINT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY \nBRANDON'S poring over sports pages and injury reports when TAMMY enters his office, sits on his desk, extends a lead sheet. \nTAMMY His name's Amir, he's a dime bettor.  Owns a dry cleaners.  We got him for the subscription.  He's on line three. \n(leans in, gives BRANDON a kiss) \nTAMMY Walter wanted your first call to be special.  Go get 'em tiger. \nBRANDON (picking up) \nAmir, my man, John Anthony here! \nINT. NEW JERSEY DRY CLEANER - DAY \nA MIDDLE EASTERN MAN (ratty t-shirt, beard stubble, sleepless look) stands in the back of a low-end dry cleaners. \nAMIR Yes, hello. \nBRANDON Today's your day, Amir!  It's a Pamplona thing, I'm running wild in the streets this weekend!  Starting with the hottest Saturday of my life!  How much can you lay with your bookie?  20 large? \nAmir \nYou crazy?  No way.  I was betting a thousand a game but... Look, I saw an ad.  I was just calling to see-- \nBRANDON --Amir, this is my lock of a lifetime!  Texas plus the six points! They win by two touchdowns! \nAmir \nReally?  I like Oklahoma in that game. \nBRANDON (looks up, sees WALTER watching) \nOklahoma huh?  Okay... well considering that, I like Texas even more now. \nAmir \nI shouldn't have called.  Thank you for-- \nBRANDON --Amir, buddy, I'm talking about banging out the biggest win of your life. \nWALTER crosses, whispers to BRANDON.  Into the phone: \nBRANDON Hold on, I got Vegas on the line. \n(pressing HOLD) \nWALTER There's only one thing you have to know about any of our clients -- they're all in the hole.  The second they pick up the phone, wham!  Right to the point!  You're above them!  Let 'em feel it!  More confidence!  More John Anthony! \n(punches speaker phone) \nBRANDON/into phone \nAmir, what's your favorite drink? \nAMIR Favorite drink?  I dunno, Pina Colada. \nBRANDON Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink.  But for now, this is what you're gonna do.  First, you're going to bet 20 large on Texas, then you're going to put on a \nHawaiian shirt, whip up your sweet little rum concoction with the orange slice and \nthe cherry, turn on the game and play \nwith the little umbrella while you sit \nback and watch Texas tear those Okies a \nnew asshole -- and when you call me back \nafter winning 20 G's the first thing out out of your mouth will be words every fratboy knows -- \"Thank you, sir, may I have another!\" \nAMIR ... What about payment? \nBRANDON Good question.  What about it? \nAmir \nWell how much is this going to cost me? \nBRANDON We take a percentage if WE win, Amir -- not exactly your problem of late, is it? \nWALTER --Can I get the damn thing out?  I want to put John Anthony on tv this week. \nBRANDON That's me.  You mean me. \nWALTER That's right.  You, John Anthony.  You're one in the same. \nTONI Go on -- get to the good part, Walter. \nWALTER Hold on.  Before I say another word, understand -- you do this thing, Brandon, and from here out you gotta eat, sleep, shit, breathe, walk, talk and fart John \nAnthony.  It's not just a new persona. \nYou can't play it.  You gotta live it.  That's how this works. The only way it works.  You have to sell it all the way. \nTONI Think it over, Brandon, don't decide now. \nBRANDON It sounds like a promotion. \nWALTER Bet your ass it is.  Five-star. \nBRANDON --I'm in. \nTONI Well that's a thoughtful response.  Here I was, worried you'd rush your decision. \nBRANDON It's the only move.  For six years I've been living on Ramen noodles.  For the \nfirst time in a long time I've got something going.  If that means I gotta do a little acting, fine. \nWALTER Living, not acting.  You understand that as of right now Brandon Lang with his fettucini knee and his self-fucking pity is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair and John \"I-can-walk-on-fucking-water\" Anthony has taken his place? \nTONI Listen to what he's asking you, Brandon. \nWALTER She's right.  There's no going back.  I mean that.  This is gonna cost me.  I'm talking about building an empire around you.  Do you understand that? \nBRANDON ... Should I wait a little to create some tension?  Of course I understand, I'm John Fucking Anthony.  I've got the crystal ball... \nINT. TONI'S SALON - DAY \nBRANDON'S FACE FILLS SCREEN.  Scissors come in, start cutting. TONI begins bringing John Anthony to life.  BRANDON chatting her up in the chair, TONI laughing at something he says and -- \nINT. BARNEY'S MEN'S STORE - DAY \nBRANDON (new haircut) stands in private room, modeling a suit. WALTER nearby, looks through racks of clothes with a SALESMAN. \nINT. MERCEDES DEALERSHIP - DAY \nBRANDON (new haircut, new suit) walks through the showroom as WALTER talks with a DEALER. \nWALTER I need a new car for my friend. \nDEALER (to BRANDON) \nDo you have any credit? \nBRANDON No. \nDEALER Walter, do you trust him? \nWALTER With my wife naked. \nDEALER (calling to BRANDON) \nIn that case, which one do you want? \nBRANDON comes over, runs his hand over a sleek, silver SL500. \nWALTER I think he likes that one. \nEXT. SIXTH AVENUE BAR - DAY \nThe silver SL500 pulls to the curb.  License plate reading \"900 KING.\"  A pair of $500 shoes emerge.  BRANDON stands on the sidewalk as the DOORMAN comes up, eyes the car. \nDoorman \nI'll watch it for you. \n(seeing the license plate) \nWhat's \"900 King?\" \nBRANDON (handing him a card) \nI don't lose. \nBRANDON heads into the bar, meets WALTER and a group of HEAVY HITTERS outside.  John ANTHONY instantly comes alive and -- \nINT.  TV PRODUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT \nBRANDON and WALTER sitting side-by-side, getting made-up. \nMAKE-UP ARTIST/to brandon \nYou're sweating a lot honey. \nBRANDON nervously regards himself in the mirror.  WALTER sees. \nWALTER (continues to his dresser, manic) \nWhat a show!  You should have seen him!  I'm sitting there watching him roll and I swear he made me want to grab a phone and call! I took the sales boys out to Smith and Wo's.  Get 'em primed for the \nweekend.  Chuck got drunk, took a swing \nat one of the deer heads on the wall. \nJust blowing off steam.  I'm gonna hire more guys Monday.  Put in more phones.      Everything's amping up.  It's okay.  There's room.  I'll tear down a \nfew walls, fit another 10 desks down \nthere easy.  I'm gonna do a whole dot-com thing around him! Oh shit, if I had me when I was his age... I never had a \nprotege.  Someone you hand it all down to.  Anything happens to me, he steps in!  Just knowing that, with the thing... I \nmean that's just beautiful! \n(changing into workout clothes) \nJust beautiful. \nTONI What are you doing? \nWALTER Going for a run.  See the sunrise.  We're doubling volume this week.  And doubling it again after that.  He can pick, he can sell, he's gonna change things around here.  He's the real deal. Knows sports from the inside.  That's how he picks.  Guy like him comes along once in a -- a -- \nTONI -- 100 years. \nWALTER Yeah, a lifetime. \nTONI Walter, come to bed. \nWALTER Not tired. \nTONI You're exhausted. \nWALTER I'm just gonna run the bridge, up Fifth, circle Central Park, be back in no time. \nTONI Get in bed.  Lie down next to me.  Come on.  Come here, Walter. \nWALTER Just a quick once-around. \nTONI Roll on your stomach for a minute. \nWALTER Just for a sec.  I've gotta meet the trainer tomorrow.  Told me to run.  Run in place, or from one place to another... \nWALTER lays down.  TONI gently massages his back.  She leans in, whispers to him.  We sense she's done this before. \nTONI --I know.  Of course you do.  This is no time to sleep, Walter... Can't sleep now... Just because you're so tired... Completely, totally, utterly exhausted... I'll be here when you get back from your \nTONI CON'D run... Right beside you... You go on now, baby, I'll stay right here... It's okay... Close your eyes... Just for a second before you leave... I'm not going anywhere... I'll just hold you-- \n(quietly crying) \nI'll wait right here for you... \nTONI'S whisperings become a constant, soothing, mantra.  WALTER'S eyes close.  Dressed in sweats and sneakers.  Gone.  TONI loosens his laces, covers him with a blanket, slides under the covers. TONI kills the light.  Seen in darkness.  Holding WALTER close, draping a protective arm around and -- \nINT. SALES ROOM - DAY \nA SLEDGE HAMMER smashes through a wall.  DELIVERYMEN dolly in new desks and chairs to accomodate more salesmen.  SOUTHIE and REGGIE at the water fountain, watch the room expand. \nSOUTHIE You see him this morning?  Wearing those suits to work now. \nREGGIE He keeps picking 90 percent I'll press the fuckers for him. \nWALTER walks in, stops at the front desk, speaks to TAMMY. \nWALTER What a weekened!  Helluva Christmas bonus if this keeps up. Where'd you hide the phone sheet? \nTAMMY locates the sheet, hands it to him.  WALTER studies it, starts away.  He sees something, stops.  Walking back -- \nWALTER (to TAMMY, pointing on the sheet) \nWho's this?  This guy here -- Lang? \nTAMMY I dunno, he said it was personal. \nWALTER Did Brandon take the call? \nTammy \nHe wasn't in. \nWALTER Don't mention it to him.  And don't patch the guy through.  Say Brandon doesn't work here, you can't reach him. \nINT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY \nBRANDON at his desk, reading The New York Post.  JERRY enters. \nJERRY You know anything about Stokley being out this weekend against the New York? \nBRANDON A knock would be nice, Jerry. \nJERRY I'm underwater here, man.  Yes or no? \nBRANDON That's a really scary thought. \nWALTER If not me, then pick someone else.  It's all in your head!  The shit that happened to you, to Toni, to me -- you know what it is?  Just that, shit that happened. \nWALTER CON'D It's not who we are.  After \nWalter con'd \nall the therapy and the analysis and the meetings and the -- aaahhhh! -- the one thing I know-- \n(yelling to the sky) \n--WE'RE ALL FUCKED UP!  We are all just so fucked up! \n(to BRANDON) \nSay it!  Shout it!  Come on, you two -- wallow with me here! \nA MAN sticks his head out a window down the street, yells -- \nMAN I'm trying to sleep, asshole! \nWALTER Dad!  Is that you? \nMAN I'll crush you like a beetle! \nWALTER How's Mom?! \nMAN Fucking freak! \nWALTER I love you too!  Don't wait up! \nWALTER, TONI and BRANDON all laugh.  The three of them doubled over on the dark, deserted street.  MAN screaming from above. The ring of a phone begins bleeding in and -- \nINT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY \nNew furniture and sports photos on the walls suggest the passage of time.  BRANDON stands before a mirror, being fitted for a suit by a TAILOR.  He has a cigar in one hand, Coke in the other, talks into a headset as he watches the TAILOR work. \nBRANDON Are you serious, Amir?  You gonna fucking haggle with me over a measly 50 thousand on the 250 grand I won you this weekend? \nEXT. AMIR'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY \nAMIR (sharply attired) stands outside his business, leaning against a brand new, red Ferrari as he talks on the phone. \nAMIR Don't get me wrong, John.  I'm thankful, very much, you're amazing, it's just that 50 thousand seems slightly steep-- \nBRANDON --The first time you call me you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon, you're crying about hocking your fiance's ring and this weekend you're phoning me from a suite at the Bellagio that I put you in -- you know what -- I'm cutting you off... You want to continue with me, I'm tagging on a 10 percent aggravation tax!  Now get to Western Union and shoot me 75 grand by tonight and we'll kiss and make up. \n(hanging up, to the TAILOR) \nNo cuff. \n(the phone rings, picking up--) \nJohn Fucking Anthony, talk to me. \nWOMAN VOICEOVER This is... May I please speak to a Brandon Lang? \nBRANDON ... Mom? \nINT. BRANDON'S VEGAS HOME - DAY \nBRANDON'S MOM drinking coffee, talking on the phone \nBRANDON'S MOTHER Brandon, is that you? \nBRANDON VOICEOVER That's me. \nINTERCUT BRANDON'S MOTHER Are you okay? \nBRANDON Never better.  Kicking ass and taking names.  Did you get the money I sent? \nBRANDON'S MOTHER Well that's why I'm calling, honey. \nBRANDON Good good good.  I talked to Denny.  Next month I'm flying you and him out here.  First class.  I'll put you up at The Plaza. You'll love this joint. \nBRANDON'S MOTHER It sounds great, Brandon, but the money -- it's too much.  Where did you get it? \nBRANDON I made it.  Earned it.  Every fucking cent.  Put it in Denny's college fund. \nBRANDON'S MOTHER Listen to you. \nBRANDON It's just how people talk here. \n(looking down at the TAILOR, edge) \nHow many times I gotta say no cuff? \nBRANDON'S MOTHER Who's this John Anthony person? \nBRANDON He's me.  I'm him. \nBRANDON'S MOTHER And he talks like that? \nBRANDON He's pretty fucking salty -- geez, I'm sorry, Mom -- I mean yeah. Look, the main point is I'm learning a lot here. \nTONI \"What do I do for myself?\"  If you drove past my salon and went two blocks down Prospect Street you would have found me 20 years ago with a needle in my arm.  I was a 5-bag a day junkie.  I would have sold Julia to get high.  Keeping it all on track, that's what I do for myself. \nBRANDON That's not living, Toni.  That's just maintaining.  You cashed in. \nTONI What the hell does that mean?  Are we talking perfection here? \nBRANDON Well, nobody's perfect... except me last weekend going 14 and \nBRANDON pulls up outside her shop.  TONI regards him. \nTONI Yeah, that's living. \nBRANDON Hell yeah.  You oughta try it some time. \nTONI (stepping from the car) \nThanks for the ride, John... \nTONI enters her shop and -- \nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY \nEight football games are winding down, another four starting. Favor one of the TV SCREENS.  A network sports update.  CHRIS BERMAN motor-mouthing a one-minute list of results. \nCHRIS BERMAN -- Big loss for Washington, going down 24-12 in Miami.  Saint Louis upsets K.C., 34-14.  And another Sunday surprise, Philly trounces Pittsburgh, 23-10. \nCHRIS BERMAN continues with the scores as -- a PENCIL runs down BRANDON'S betting sheet -- checking off results -- loss --  loss -- loss -- loss -- loss -- the pencil pauses -- suddenly snaps from the pressure of the person's hand and -- WALTER stares at BRANDON, seated on the sofa, watching the tvs.  It's obvious they're getting killed. \nBRANDON I'm gonna go work out. \nWALTER Sit down!  You're watching every game!  Every second of every minute of every game!  Don't even think of leaving! \nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nAll but one tv is dark.  The last game ends and a remote control suddenly shatters the screen.  WALTER paces the office.  BRANDON still on the sofa.  No one else in the room.  A wall clock reads 12:19 AM.  WALTER picks up BRANDON'S betting sheet, holds it like a dead fish. \nWALTER ... How do you go 3 and 11?  Wanna know how -- you make Sunday's picks on Tuesday!  It rained in Cincinatti!  Two starting QBs didn't play!  You're a handicapper, not a psychic! \nBRANDON There's still Monday night and the parlay. \nWALTER Fuck Monday night!  Fuck the parlay! \nYou were pissed at me, right?  The commission thing? \nBRANDON I don't know. \nWALTER You fucked with me, right?  Joke's on me, right?  The money thing. Okay, I think we're on dangerous ground here but I'm giving you a bump, 10 percent.  Now what about Monday night's game? You want to look over that pick?  Because everyone's gonna double down to climb out of the fucking hole you put 'em in. \nBRANDON Monday night's fine. \nWALTER You'd bet your mother's house on it? \nBRANDON I don't bet. \nWALTER If you did? \nBRANDON I like the pick, Walter. \nWALTER On your mother's house or not? \nBRANDON With my mother in it. \nINT. UPPER EAST SIDE BAR - NIGHT \nUp-scale.  BRANDON sits at the end of the rail, empty glasses lined before him, watching a wall TV with the sound off.  Monday Night Football's on.  His glazed expression suggests it's been a long three hours.  PATRONS around him socialize, laugh, enjoy the bar's oasis-like vibe.  But for BRANDON, it's just him and the game as -- a GIRL approaches, big smile. \nGIRL Oh my God -- Brandon! \nBRANDON glances up, quickly goes back to watching the game. \nGirl \nOh come on, I know you remember -- two weeks ago, Aqua -- I'm Heather. \nBRANDON (eyes glued to the game) \nUh-huh. \nHeather \nThis is like such a concidence.  I live right around the corner. This is my neighborhood bar. \nShe sits beside him, signals the bartender. \nHeather \nApple martini. \n(back to BRANDON) \nSo listen, my office is renting out a loft this weekend, really fun group, it's gonna be a big blow-out, a PR thing -- music, open bar.  Wednesday night, I want you to come, I mean I'd really love to hook up. \nPOV BRANDON -- flurry of action on the TV.  Final seconds.  BRANDON lasered on the screen. \nHEATHER (leaning in, laughing) \nBRANDON Son of a bitch... What the fuck-- \nBODYGUARD Mr. Novian wants to see you.  Now. \nBRANDON (seeing a gun in his waistband) \n... Tell him to call. \nBODYGUARD You tell him. \nBRANDON looks, sees NOVIAN nearby. \nNOVIAN I didn't recognize you without the suit, John. \nBRANDON This is my time off.  It's how I clear my head.  You want to talk, pick a time. \nNOVIAN Or should I call you Brandon?  Someone costs you 18 mill, you do some research. \nI know more than your name, Brandon.  I know where you're from. Where your family lives.  Hell, I just came from Vegas.  Your Mom, sweet lady... dealt me three blackjacks in a row. \n(stepping close) \nWhere's the cocky motherfucker who came to my house? \nBRANDON I'm leaving. \nThe BODYGUARD grabs his arm.  Iron grip. \nNOVIAN Feel that?  I hate the cold.  Winter's coming.  Water's getting rough. \nBRANDON What the fuck is this about?  If you don't like my picks, use someone else. \nNOVIAN Oh, I'm not using you again.  That's already decided.  And I can't get my money back.  It's gone.  No, I came for an apology. \nThe BODYGUARD holds him tight.  Light fading.  No one around. \nNOVIAN Look me in the eye and say you're sorry. Say it so as to make me believe you mean it. \nCold gust.  NOVIAN closes the distance between them. \nBRANDON You flew to New York for-- \nNOVIAN --That's right. \nBRANDON ... I'm sorry. \nNOVIAN I don't accept it.  Not good enough.  Try again. \nBRANDON I don't know what you want me to say.  I'm sorry.  I am.  I'm very sorry. \nNOVIAN Pathetic. \nBRANDON I am very, very sorry.  That's a lot of money. \nNOVIAN Not even close. \nBRANDON I'm sorry! \nNOVIAN This isn't going to work.  I'll have to get satisfaction somehow else. \nBRANDON Look, I'm not it -- I... \nNOVIAN inches from BRANDON.  Unbuttons his coat.  Sound of a zipper.  BRANDON glances down, sees Novian reach into his fly. BRANDON jumps.  The BODYGUARD holds him.  NOVIAN comes close. BRANDON struggles, very unsure where this might be going and-- \nHe squirms -- enduring something -- trickling water heard -- NOVIAN staring right at BRANDON -- finishes pissing on BRANDON'S leg.  NOVIAN motions his BODYGUARD to let go and the men walk off.  BRANDON stands there.  Alone in the gloom and -- \nINT. STUDIO PRODUCTION SET - NIGHT \nWALTER, BRANDON, JERRY and CHUCK at the desk, waiting for the weekly taping to start.  WALTER jots notes.  JERRY leans over. \nJERRY I scored you the new mikes, Walter.  No wires to mess with. What do you think? \nWALTER I'm busy. \nJERRY Listen, I think I should lead off.  I have some really strong stuff. \nWALTER You got a good hole, Jerry.  Stay in it. \nJERRY C'mon, I went 8 for 12 last weekend.  I'm hot.  I'm feeling it. \nWALTER doesn't respond, continues working.  JERRY fumes. \nTECHNICIAN 60 seconds. \nJERRY What am I, wood? \nWALTER You got one good weekend under your belt, don't push it. \nJERRY One weekend?  The Sykes System revolutionized this industry. \n(pulling a newspaper, showing a full-page ad for JOHN ANTHONY) \nExplain something to me, where's my fucking ad? \nWALTER Take a hike. \nBRANDON sits at his desk.  Staring out at the city.  His phone rings.  Again.  Again.  Finally pressing speaker phone -- \nBRANDON Hello. \nIntercut - amir in payphone beside N.J. Turnpike - dawn \nAmir \n(dishevelled, distraught) \nI'm wiped out, John... \nBRANDON Amir? \nAmir \nMy business... My house... My credit... \nBRANDON No, now listen to me -- we got a big weekend coming up, buddy \nAMIR Still you talk like this.  Who the fuck are you, like this is some kind of game.  I was betting a few thousand a Sunday when I called you.  You pushed me.  Every call.  All the time with your talk... I lost $380,000 this weekend... I was going to get married... I had a life... \nBRANDON staring at the phone, barely holding it together, sees TAMMY standing there -- holding the day's newspapers, hearing the conversation on speaker. \nAMIR No words now, huh?  No more money to squeeze so you shut up. How do you fucking live with yourself? \nClick.  Amir hangs up.  Crushing beat.  TAMMY staring at him. \nBRANDON What? \n(face hardening) \nFuck him if he can't take a joke. \nTAMMY puts the day's newspapers on his desk, leaves.  BRANDON glances down, something catches his eye.  BRANDON pulls a newspaper from the pile -- finds himself staring at a full-page ad for JOHN ANTHONY.  Big smile.  Copy advertising \"The Million Dollar Man!\" and -- \nINT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING \nBRANDON paces the dim space.  Sits on the bench press.  Leans back on the board.  He stares up at the weights.  Moves the weight pin to 250... and slowly starts to lift.  One rep.  Two.  Three. Four.  A bad of sweat forms.  BRANDON throws off the jacket. Pulls off the tie.  Removes his shirt and shoes.  He resumes lifting, grim determination -- the weights rising over and over and over -- faster and faster and -- \nINT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nBRANDON, t-shirt and sweats, approaches WALTER'S office, bursts through the door -- \nBRANDON I know what the problem is! \nBRANDON freezes.  WALTER watches two MEN unload stacks of money from a briefcase, pile them on his desk. \nBRANDON I'll come back later. \nWALTER No!  C'mon in.  We're done here.  Right fellas?  All through? You want a bite before you go?  Something to drink? \nThe two MEN leave.  WALTER lights a cigarette. \nBRANDON Who were they? \nWALTER We need a bat light or something, you know a signal I can shoot up at the \nWalter con'd \nclouds and no matter where you are you \ncan look up and you'll know I need you.  Maybe that would work. 'Cause last night I must've beeped you a hundred times. \nBRANDON Who were they? \nWALTER They're from the Salvation Army.  How the hell does someone go 1-for-8?  A fucking monkey tossing darts could do better! \nBRANDON What's with the money, Walter? \nWALTER 1-for-fucking-8! \n(coming around the desk) \nI have a plan.  From now on we take your picks and reverse everything! Like a Twilight Zone episode where everything's the opposite! You say black we go white!  A is B!  Lose becomes win! \nBRANDON (staring at the pile of cash) \nHow much is that? \nWALTER (sweeping the pile to the floor) \nHow much is what?  Oh, that -- 275,000 dollars! \nBRANDON What happened to the two mill, all the other money? \nWALTER I was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up.  The last few weeks I thought keep the pressure off.  He'll come around. Climb out on his own.  Now I figure fuck it!  Time to turn on the lights!  Let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in! Maybe that'll shake him up!  So what do you want to know?  I got three mortgages on this house, I'm gambling again and to cover my losses I just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on a 106th and Broadway!  All this -- everything you see around you -- \nis smoke and mirrors!  I shoulda been a magician! \nWALTER CON'D ... What'd you say when you came in?  You    were in a good mood when you walked through the door and you said something. \nBRANDON You're betting my picks? \nWALTER You went 82 and 11!  You were picking 80 percent -- how could I fucking not!?  Trouble is I bet heavy after you went a hundred percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet!  One decent weekend and I would have been set for life!  One decent weekend! \nBRANDON Walter, it's over.  What use could John Anthony be to you now? Only an idiot would follow him after the streak I've been on. \nWALTER Wrong!  Hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go hot.  Bettors will climb back aboard. \nWALTER CON'D They know you!  And when your luck turns they'll remember you went 80 percent for half the season!  We'll make it all back on the last game and by next year they'll forget everything. \nBRANDON Who said anything about next year? \nWALTER Sports betting's year-round. \nBRANDON I'm not doing this next year. \nWALTER You made a career choice!  I bankrolled it! \nTONI VO Let him go, Walter. \nWALTER and BRANDON turn, see TONI at the door. \nWALTER Of course you stick up for him! \nTONI Meaning what? \nWALTER Who's side are you on? \nTONI I didn't realize I had to choose. \nWALTER (to BRANDON) \nLook, you got a magnificent gift.  Own that.  So you strike out sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences.  You're a champion, Brandon.  A champion goes down 186 times but gets up 187.  I'm not letting you stay down.  This isn't about you or me or Toni, this transcends that -- this is metaphysical, this is cosmic, this is eternal -- this is God... Besides, we have a contract. \nBRANDON Bullshit! \nTONI You can't own someone, Walter. \nWALTER I created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen! I plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him, hooked him up with every major client I have and I will be goddamned if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him! Why the hell am I even explaining this to you!  This is between me and him!  Get out! \nBRANDON Don't talk to her like that. \nWALTER I need you to tell me how to talk to my wife?  When I'm talking you'll shut your fucking toilet! \nTONI (to BRANDON) \nLeave. \nINT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBRANDON comes down the hall.  TONI and WALTER heard yelling through the office door.  BRANDON hesitates, walks out and -- \nINT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDim darkness.  A distant siren bleeds in as -- \nWALTER'S VOICE Brandon... Brandon. \nBRANDON'S POV.  His eyes open.  WALTER'S face fills FRAME. \nWALTER Wake up. \nBRANDON What time is it? \nWALTER Five in the morning.  Listen, I gotta fly to Vegas to meet with some clients.  Hand holding thing.  Keep 'em on board for the final game.  Because you can do this thing, Brandon.  End of the season's the perfect place to turn this streak around.  I'll be back to you out to dinner.  Get you back in the groove.  9:30. Nobu. Gotta catch my flight.  See you tonight.  Look sharp. We're turning it around. \nWALTER backs out, kills the lights.  Darkness returns and -- \nINT. NOBU - NIGHT \nBRANDON alone at a table, sipping a sake when TONI, evening dress, sits next to him. \nBRANDON Hey, I didn't know you were coming. \nTONI Walter was delayed, he's coming back in the morning.  Asked if I'd fill in. \nBRANDON (processing this) \nThat's funny, he didn't call me.  You look great. \nTONI silent. \nBRAndon \nYou okay? \nTONI Julia did her ballet recital today.  God she was beautiful. \nBRANDON She is. \nTONi \n... He's betting again. \nBRANDON regards her. \nTONI I can't believe I'm here again.  I saw it coming.  I just... I just couldn't stop it. \nBRANDON Nobody could. \nBRANDON I can't take this. \nWALTER vo \nWhy not? \nBRANDON It's too much. \nWALTER vo \nFor what?  You're family, Brandon.  We all love each other, right? I'm like a father, you're like my son -- gee, sorry Toni, but I guess that makes you his mother. \nWALTER PANS to TONI, staring at the fire.  Strained silence. \nWALTER vo \nWhat?  Somebody fart or something? \nTONI starts taking off the earrings. \nWALTER vo \nLeave 'em on. \nTONI They're for evening. \nWALTER vo \nGood, wear 'em to bed tonight. \n(VIDEO CAMERA back on BRANDON) \nWho do you think'll win the big game? \nBRANDON Turn it off. \nWALTEr/still taping \nBetter yet, don't say anything.

TIMES SQUARE NEWS STAND - DAY \nBRANDON loads up on newspapers and sports magazines and -- \nINT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBRANDON surrounded by a sea of sports pages, comentary, ratings. He looks up at a blaring TV and -- \nTHE TV FILLS FRAME -- TIME CUT as various sports shows come on back-to-back -- each providing a wealth of competing Superbowl predictions and analysis. \nCAMERA TIGHTENS ON THE SCREEN AND WE SEE, for every hopped-up SPORTSCASTER who picks Denver, an equally assured COUNTERPART chooses New York.  One after another.  No consensus at all. Airwaves awash in past-season stats -- regular season stats -- post-season stats -- all of it blending into an overwhelming, mind-numbing, jarring blather of pure disagreement and -- \nINT. TV PRODUCTION STUDIO BATHROOM - NIGHT \nBRANDON, suit and tie, splashes water on his face, stares at himself in the mirror.  He pulls reams of stats and newspaper reports from his pocket, regards the Superbowl pick sheet.  Blank space for the winner.  Blank space for the over/under.  BRANDON fumbling with his sheets of data, desperately searching for an answer when he suddenly hurls it all in the trash.  Kicks the can.  Kicks it again. \nTECHNICIAN'S VOICE 60 seconds till we go live, Mr. Anthony! \nBRANDON looks over.  The unfinished pick sheet lies crumpled by the toilet.  He smooths it.  Pulls a coin. \nBRANDON Heads, New York.  Tails Denver. \nHe flips the coin.  Palms it.  Heads.  BRANDON checks the box. \nBRANDON Heads, over.  Tails, under. \nBRANDON flips again, lets the coin hit the floor, watches it spin, slowly come to a stop, drop to its side and -- \nINT. TV PRODUCTION STUDIO - NIGHT \nBRANDON sits at the set.  Looks over at CHUCK, in his own world, working something from his teeth.  BRANDON Slides the pick sheet to WALTER. \nTECHNICIAN Ten seconds! \nBRANDON Wanna know about the picks? \nWALTER New York minus the two-and-a-half points and the over, what should I know? \nBRANDON I flipped a coin to decide. \nTECHNICIAN Five, four, three, two, one -- \nWALTER Hello everybody and welcome to the big weekend!

Now let's go to the oracle, God's gift -- John Anthony! \nBRANDON'S face fills the monitor.  Completely off-guard. \nBRANDON ... Wow.  What an offer.  The phones'll be flooded. \nWALTER We're that sure!  John, rundown the pitfalls facing the average bettor.  I mean a game this huge, all the added dynamics, without your expertise most bettors might as well just... flip a coin, am I right? \nBRANDON (tapping into it) \nThat's right, Walter!  Last game of the year ladies and gentlemen! Come Sunday you're either ending the season a winner or a loser! It's crunch time!  The last action on the way out the door! And I am absolutely, 1000-percent sure that I, John Anthony, will end the season ahead of the game! \nWalter walks back to the bedroom.  The tv's on.  WALTER pauses to watch another play, about to leave when he spies the Rolex on the nightstand, envelope beside it.  WALTER picks up the letter. Sees his name on the outside.  He opens it, reads. TONI appears in the BG.  WALTER turns. \nWALTER ... He left. \nTONI I know. \nWALTER And you didn't you tell me? \nTONI He asked me not to. \nWALTER Just like that?  No goodbye? \nTONI I'm sure it's in the letter. \nWALTER I'm sure it is... I wonder what's not in here? \nTONI What do you mean? \nWALTER What do you mean, what do I mean?  When it comes to Brandon you seem to have all the answers. \nTONI He had enough.  He wanted his life back. \nWALTER He said that to you? \nTONI Yeah, loud and clear, by leaving. \nWALTER I think it's something else. \nTONI Yeah, tell me. \nWALTER You know. \nTONI No. \nON -- the TV.  New York's driving.  Game reaching a head.  A clock in the corner counts down the final two minutes. \nWALTER You have no idea, huh? \nTONI You're missing the game. \nWALTER No I'm not.  This is the game. \nINT. JFK AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT \nBRANDON travels down an escalator and -- \nINT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTONI at the door.  WALTER approaches. \nWALTER Something was bothering him.  I mean sure, maybe he was homesick. Or I was thinking maybe he had such, you know, deep feelings for me he couldn't face saying goodbye.  What a minute.  I just \nthought of something.  Just came to me.  Out of the blue.  What about this?  Maybe Brandon left without telling me because -- \n(full volume, in her face) \nYou let him fuck you! \nON -- TV.  A New York RECEIVER catches a long bomb.  Nailed at the 20.  Clock down to a minute 30.  No time to huddle and -- \nWALTER Do you deny it? \nTONI Do I have to? \nWALTER I know you did! \nTONI Really?  Another \"lock of the year?\" \nWALTER I saw you, Toni!  I saw you go into his room that night!  This room!  With him!  I never went to Vegas! \nINT. JFK AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT \nBRANDON walks through FRAME.  PASSENGERS rush for flights and-- \nINT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTONI and WALTER in the middle of it -- \nTONI You mean you lied to me about the trip! \nWALTER Don't talk to me about lying! \nTONI I guess you had the whole thing planned? \nWALTER Don't make this about me! \nTONI Put me out there on a tray! \nWALTER Yeah, I put the tray out there -- but you didn't have to shove an apple in your mouth and jump on it!  On him! \nON -- New York throws a pass.  Blocked.  45 seconds left -- \nWALTER Admit it! \nTONI You played me! \n", "test1_input": "WALTER This kid's different, he's different -- wait a minute.  This has nothing to do with you, you know I do business up here. Why are you so angry? \nTONI Are we actually going to have this conversation?  Are you completely clueless? \nWALTER You're jealous.  Look at you! \nTONI Of what?! \nWALTER Gee, I don't know -- Brandon screwing someone? \nTONI You really are fucking crazy, Walter!  That never entered my mind! \nWALTER That's not where those thoughts enter. \nTONI Fuck you! \nTONI goes into the kitchen, slams the door.  Calling to her -- \nWALTER You'll be happy to know he didn't sleep with her.  I paid her off just for coming.  No pun intended. \nWALTER grimaces, clutches his side.  WALTER pops one, two -- three pills from a vial, let's them settle as JULIA, princess clothes, runs down the hall, leaps in his arms.  WALTER stifles the pain of her embrace.  Carries her down the hall. \nWALTER ... Julia my jewel, you're getting big angel. \nJULIA Can we play princess, Daddy? \nWALTER Course we can.  Who am I gonna be? \nJULIA You're the king, daddy, like always. \nINT. SPORTS ADVISORS TV SET - NIGHT \nBRANDON practicing John Anthony expressions.  A pretty MAKE-UP ARTIST finishes touching him up. \nMAKE-UP ARTIST I made 500 bucks off your picks last week.  I was thinking maybe we could go out later and get a little wild... you can help me blow some. \nBRANDON Let's get really wild and you can blow mine. \nThe GIRL laughs.  BRANDON crosses the stage, takes his place on the set between WALTER and JERRY.  CHUCK sits off to the side, eating a muffin.  WALTER looks voer at BRANDON -- \nWALTER Look at you.  I like the tan. \nBRANDON Toni put one of those lamps down in my room.  The ladies do love it. \nTECHNICIAN 60 seconds! \nWALTER John's up first tonight, Jerry. \nJERRY What? \nWALTER John Anthony's leading off tonight. \nJERRY John Anthony's leading? \nWALTER Somebody tell the engineer there's an echo in here. \nJERRY Two years I lead and you bury me in the deck over a few lousy fucking weekends?  The Sykes System's based on percentages -- the long haul. \nWALTER No, that's called a mutual fund, Jerry. \nJERRY (to CHUCK) \nYou gonna sit for this shit? \nCHUCK shrugs, finishes his muffin.  JERRY turns to WALTER -- \nJERRY ... He leads, I'm walking. \nWALTER He's leading. \nJERRY unclips his microphone, stands. \nWALTER That's baby talk!  You need a fucking rattle!  Sit down! \n(staring him down) \nYou probably think you know what I'm gonna say... how everything you got I pay for.  Your apartment, your car, your kid's school -- and it's true.  You'd be right.  I do.  Now I don't know, Jerry, maybe you break your losing streak, end the shneid, start winning again and find yourself another job, but then of course maybe you don't.  I don't see you taking that chance.  My gut says you'll walk out of here on principle or even pride but not on a gamble, a hunch yet.  And if you do, fuck it.  I give a shit?  The only reason I keep you around is it makes me look loyal and him-- \n(pointing at BRANDON) \n--look good!  Now you got three fucking seconds to stop standing there like dog \nshit on my porch and sit down and shut \nthe fuck up or you can kiss everything you have goodbye!  The clock's started. \nBeat.  JERRY sinks into his seat.  WALTER turns to BRANDON. \nWALTER See that?  He made the safe play.  Me, I would've walked, but I'm a fucked-up human being.  That's the difference between us. Right there.  Jerry's a statistician, I'm a gambler.  And you're not a gambler, not really -- until you bet more than you can afford to lose. \nTECHNICIAN Five, four, three, two, one -- \nWALTER Welcome to week 7 of pro football! \nINT.

I'm heading out with some people, everything else cool? \nDENNY Everything's great.  Did dad reach you? \nBRANDON Dad?  No, why? \nDENNY He keeps calling.  He saw you on tv, wants to talk to you.  I gave him your work number but he says they won't put him through. \nBRANDON Really? \nBRANDON'S eye catches WALTER across the set, watching a playback of the show.  TONI enters the studio, kisses WALTER hello and \nINT. TV PRODUCTION HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT \nWALTER, BRANDON and TONI exit the stage, enter into the lobby. \nWALTER I'm starved, there's a new steak house around the corner.  You two split a prime rib, I'll get the porterhouse, we'll whack it up! \nTONI Let's walk, you could use the exercise. \nWALTER Stop worrying.  We're set-- \n(arm around BRANDON) \n--I got the next Jimmy the Greek here!  I'm serious!  Nostra-fucking-damus was a novelty act next to this guy! \nBRANDON Let me ask you something, Walter. \nWALTER Shoot. \nBRANDON Have you been blocking any of my calls? \nWALTER Of course.  You don't need distractions, there's a lot of crazies out there. \nBRANDON Does that include my father? \nWALTER You're asking, I'll tell you... Yeah. \nBRANDON (striding outside) \nSon of a bitch -- for how long? \nWALTER (following) \nWeek or so. \nTONI Walter. \nEXT. TV PRODUCTION HOUSE BUILDING - NIGHT \nWALTER and TONI trail BRANDON down the lamp-lit sidewalk. \nWALTER Hold on, Brandon, if I didn't block his calls would you've talked to him?  Honestly. \nBRANDON That's not the point! \nWALTER Then what exactly is the point, Brandon? What's the full story here?  What's the deal with your old man? \nBRANDON You tell it, you seem to know. \nWALTER --I only know pieces.  I was trying to spare you from something. \nBRANDON (stopping under a street light) \nSpare me?  By blocking my calls?  There's nothing you can spare me from.  He's a drunk.  Left when I was 9.  I couldn't t compete with a bottle.  End of story. \nWALTER ... That's it?  That's the best you can do?  Hell, Toni and I'll match our dysfunctional childhoods against yours \nany day of the week.  My father, 5-foot- \narms like this, cock the size of a hebrew national -- if I even looked at him wrong he knocked me across the room like LaMotta. He yelled so much, until I was five I thought my name was asshole. Tell him about you, Toni.  Well go on -- \nTONI I didn't have a great home-life either. \nWALTER \"Great?\"  Tell him about the uncle-- \nTONI --He gets the idea. \nWALTER Don't sugarcoat this shit, you were abused by everybody but the family pet, isn't that right, honey? \nTONI Walter, please. \nWALTER (to BRANDON) \nYour father was a drunk, a jerk -- so what?  It happens.  I'm glad I blew him off.  Know why?  Because what you need is a new image of a man.  How 'bout me? \n", "test1_id": 3141, "test2_input": "WALTER You weren't listening!  You're not paying attention to me!  There's no such thing as too far!  Push everything as far as you can! Push it until it starts pushing back and then push some goddamn more!

Peaceful beat. \nWALTER I start to die, fuck the hospital, just sit me down, I wanna kack here. \nA beefy BODYGUARD enters followed by a tan, broad shouldered MAN of 50.  WALTER extends his hand. \nWALTER Mr. Novian!  What can I say?  An honor.  This is my associate, John Anthony. \nMR. NOVIAN nods, settles in a chair.  WALTER and BRANDON sit. \nNOVIAN You should know I think that most sports services are a complete scam... However, I hear your boy here's having quite a season. What's your system? \nWALTER (looking around) \nOur system?  Fuck that, what's your system? \nWalter laughs.  Novian stone-faced, glances at his watch when-- \nBRANDON It's a privilege to meet you, Mr. Novian.   You have a beautiful home.  Let's start with how much you bet. \nNOVIAN A million a game, across the board. \nBRANDON Nice round number, is that our ceiling here?  Is that the most we're working with? \nNOVIAN \"We're\" not doing anything until I hear how you feel about this weekend. \nBRANDON Do you rent that yacht out there? \nNOVIAN I own it. \nBRANDON Well, sir, that's how I feel about this weekend.  That may sound cocky, I don't care.  I didn't come down here to lie. \nNOVIAN Do you have inside information? \nBRANDON If I did I wouldn't share that with you.  My record speaks for itself.  The truth is I know these teams better than they know themselves.  I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes the Monday Night parlay. \nNOVIAN Why should I believe you? \nBRANDON With all due respect, Mr. Novian, you can't afford not to. \nNOVIAN I can afford to do any damn thing I please. \nBRANDON Can you?  What I'm saying is can you -- can anyone for that matter -- afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to bet to feel a win?  Winning's a funny thing, Mr. Novian... it's one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy.  Or was, until you called me. \nCharged beat.  A tight grin's glued to WALTER'S face. \nBRANDON The price is a quarter million, Mr. Novian -- up-front -- in addition to a percentage of every game you win. \nNOVIAN Fuck you.  I never pay anything up front. \nBRANDON And we've never charged it before.  But with what you're betting, 250 up front's a bargain.  You want this weekend's winners, that's my offer.  Take it or leave it. \nNOVIAN (standing) \n... Step outside. \nBRANDON and WALTER exchange looks, unsure where this is going. \nEXT.

A young SALESMAN appears at the door. \nYOUNG SALESMAN They need it, Mr. Anthony. \nBRANDON picks up his pen, regards the box for Monday Night -- Seattle or New Orleans?  The point spread is Seattle minus 3. A box beside it is for the over/under.  That number is 34. BRANDON about to pick when he stops, looks up, smiles -- \nBRANDON Three questions.

Over 34 points or under! \nYOUNG SALESMAN Over! \nBRANDON checks it off, gives him the finished form. \nYOUNG SALESMAN I'm not handing that in.  Like a million dollars is going on that game! \nBRANDON Like a lot more than that.  Relax.  I think we know I can pick. Today I'm picking you.

Raymond's got it!  Breaks the plane! Touch down!  Seattle takes it 20 to 17!  They win by three!

Whoops of excitement as WALTER jumps up on his desk, starts throwing cash.  JERRY moves through the raucous CROWD, finds BRANDON against a wall, out of the fray, watching WALTER hurl money in the air. \nJERRY Congratulations, Brandon... Or should I say John?  Either way it's amazing.  I must say I am impressed.  Letting salesmen make your picks?  That's balls. \nBRANDON (watching WALTER hurl money) \nBest get in there and collect some of this, Jerry.  The way you're picking, you're gonna need some for a rainy day. \nJERRY Keep talking, sugarmouth.  Must feel pretty good to be that plugged in.  You got a good streak going.  Well enjoy it while it lasts. The gambling Gods are a fickle bunch, sooooo easily offended. \nBRANDON makes his way through the room, reaches WALTER. \nWALTER Here, get you teeth fixed.

Puts him in a headlock. \nWALTER \"Fair?\"  Honey, you don't know what fair is.  What's fair is not giving you the money.  Now I'm only gonna say this once. If you want something from me more than a gazunheidt after a sneeze you have to do more than think about it.  Or ask for it. You gotta earn it.  You gotta fight for it.  You gotta rip it out of my fucking talons.  John Anthony would know that.  That's what he'd do.  As a matter of fact, next time you come with that shit, come as John Anthony.

Don't call me unless the lines change. \nWALTER The salmon are running!  You're staying right here and fielding calls.  You're not going off to play golf and have fun. \nBRANDON Fun?  Senor, you have obviously never played Wingfoot. \nWALTER Stop screwing around, you got a lot to do before this weekend. \nBRANDON I'm not asking you if I can leave, Walter -- I'm telling you that's how it is, understood?  You want my picks, hell I'll make 'em now. \nBRANDON sits, starts filling out the week's betting form. \nWALTER Whoa -- hold on -- slow down -- today's only Tuesday, you have all week. \nBRANDON I don't need it. \nWALTER Hey -- we're gonna be advising somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million dollars this week. \nBRANDON Nice neighborhood. \nWALTER You're really gonna make your picks now?  No study?  No analysis? Just like that? \nBRANDON I'm in the zone, Walter.  Locked in.  You want my picks, I might as well do it now! \nWashington at Miami giving 8, Washington! \nSaint Louis at K.C. getting 12 -- K.C. by three touchdowns! Pittsburgh at Philly giving 3 -- Philly, another blow out! \n(handing WALTER the finished form) \nBrandon con'd \nThere they are, unless you want next weekend's picks too.  You're welcome to join me, Walter, it's a beautiful track. \nWALTER ... Okay, fine.  Take a break.  Go play golf.  We'll put the picks on ice and look 'em over tomorrow. \nBRANDON (walking out) \nI won't be in tomorrow. \nWALTER Then the next day! \nBut BRANDON'S gone.  WALTER considers what's just occured, regards the finished betting form.  He dons his glasses and begin examining BRANDON'S picks and -- \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE BROWNSTONE - DAY \nBRANDON loads his golf clubs in the Mercedes, spies TONI coming down the front steps. \nBRANDON Where're you headed? \nTONI Some of us have to work. \nBRANDON Come on, get in.  I'll give you a lift. \nANGLE ON -- upper brownstone window.  WALTER looks down.  Watches TONI'S legs swing into BRANDON'S sports car and -- \nINT. MOVING MERCEDES - DAY \nBRANDON speeds fast down a street.  Uncomfortable beat. \nBRANDON Some ride, huh?  Feel that?  Feel that? \nTONI Slow down, Brandon. \nBRANDON Why?  This car was made to go fast. \nTONI Not with me in it. \nBRANDON C'mon, Toni, loosen up. \n(goosing the gas, laughing) \nLet me ask you something.  When you're not at the shop, or running Julia to play dates or keeping Walter from losing his mind, which I know is a full-time job, \nwhat do you do for you, Toni? \nTONI I stay busy. \nBRANDON That's not what I asked. \nTONI Yes it is. \nBRANDON What do you do for you, Toni, for yourself. \n", "test3_id": 3143}

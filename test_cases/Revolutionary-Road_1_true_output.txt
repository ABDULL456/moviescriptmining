SHEP You know what I think? 
Milly looks up. 
SHEP (CONT'D) I think this whole plan sounds a little immature. 
Milly's face brightens. 
MILLY Oh God, I'm so relieved. Me too... I was thinking that the whole time. 
SHEP What kind of man is going to sit around in his bathrobe picking his nose while his wife works all day? 
MILLY I don't know, Shep.   I just don't know. 
Milly is crying. 
SHEP What is it? 
MILLY Nothing.   I'm just so relieved. 
He sits down beside her.   She falls into his arms. 
SHEP Come on. Don't cry. Please. It's all right. It's going to be all right. 
A kid's shout from somewhere in the house.     Milly sits up. 
SHEP (CONT'D) I'll go. 
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT. 
Frank and April burst into the kitchen, laughing. 
FRANK Jesus, their faces! You'd think we'd told them that we were swimming up the Yangtzee river or something. 
Laughing, April hands Frank a drink. 
FRANK (CONT'D) You know what this is like, April? Talking like this? The whole idea of taking off to Europe this way? It's like the way I felt going up to the line the first time, in the war. I was probably just as scared as everyone else, but inside I never felt better. I felt alive. I felt full of blood. (MORE) 
FRANK (CONT'D) And everything looked more real. The guys in their uniforms. The snow on the fields, the trees. And all of us just... walking. I mean I was scared of course. But I kept thinking: this is it. This is the truth. 
APRIL I felt that way once too. 
He looks at her.   And there's something in her eyes. 
FRANK When? 
APRIL The first time you made love to me. 
He walks over to her and kisses her passionately. 
And they make love that way, face to face, with the lights on, looking into each other's eyes, fully clothed, until he comes inside her. 
As he comes, she makes a sound, almost inaudible, but it sounds like... 
APRIL (CONT'D) ...No 
He holds her, breathing heavily.    She strokes his head. 
INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR - DAY. 
Frank walks across the 15th floor, the atmosphere unusually abuzz. 
He arrives in his cubicle. Jack, Ed and Vance are talking in hushed tones. 
FRANK What's up? 
ED Bart Pollock is here.

{"train": "THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU \nWritten by \nGeorge Nolfi \nBased on a short story by \nPhilip K Dick \nBLACK SCREEN \nThe sounds of a large crowd, but muffled, as if we're inside, and hearing the crowd through a window or door. FADE IN ON: \nINT. SOME SORT OF LOBBY -- DAY \nDAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down, thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and confident. Content. Completely in his element. In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside: \nVOICE ON PA SYSTEM Thank you so much for coming today-- A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David. \nBLUE BLAZER Congressman Norris-? Now REVEAL that we're \u00c2\u00b1fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building at St. Johns University. A thousand people crowd the quad out front. \"Norris for Senate\" placards everywhere. \nBLUE-BLAZER Fred O'Malley with the DNC. I've never seen a crowd this big turn out so early in the cycle. CHARLIE TRAYNOR, 36, arrives--. \nCHARLIE Just wait 'till you see how they respond to him.. David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State. \nDAVID Don't build me up like that, Charlie. He'll be disappointed. \nEXT. ST. JOHNS UNIVERSITY -- MAIN QUAD -- DAY \nThe crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of the Admin Building. \nDAVID Hi there. I'm David Norris. And I'm running for the US Senate. \nThe crowd goes wild. \nMONTAGE -- SENATE CAMPAIGN --David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation. The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing ovation. --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning. --Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby. --David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin redevelopment of an old military base upstate. --He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to follow him. Especially young people. --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it. --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie stands nearby watching him speak:. \nINT. SHERATON HOTEL ROOM --UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- DUSK \nDavid enters his hotel room. The silence contrasts starkly with the noisy energy of the campaign trail. He turns on the TV. Scrolls through the channels. After a moment shuts it off. Total silence again. It bothers him. He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and meetings across the state. He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open Space Initiative. \nDAVID \n(TESTING HIMSELF) Karen Woods, founder. Husband: Bob. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Kids: Samantha, painting, and Ricky, Little League. John Pascal. Wife: Anna. St. John's grad. Two year old: Loyita... He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days out. \nDAVID \n(MORE TESTING) Abagail \"Abby\" Best, Stuart Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan Sabovic, Jim Vargas... His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning. He doesn't need to review. It's already all there. He closes his itinerary file. Goes to the window and looks out at the trees. The silence back...it's deafening. \nINT. SHERATON LOBBY -- UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT \nCharlie enters the lobby. Stops suddenly: spots David, holding court at`the hotel bar. Fifteen strangers around him as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's clearly losing his voice. Charlie walks over, pulls him aside. \nCHARLIE What the hell? What happened to \"I'm going to have softie tea, rest my voice, and go to bed early?\" You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and you have to be up at four AM for us to make it in time. David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand he picks up a cup and saucer. \nDAVID I had some tea. (sees Charlie's not in the \nMOOD) Come on, man. We're eight points up in the polls. I've gotta cut loose every once in a while and have a life. This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like having a life to him... \nCHARLIE Ten. \nDAVID What? \nCHARLIE Latest poll has you ten points up. A slow smile spreads across David's face. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK SCREEN The sound of a busy room. Then one voice, much louder: \nCAMPAIGN AIDE. County reporting: 8901 for Lynfield, 7233 for Norris. \nINT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT \nCharlie Traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that. She's writing vote totals onto a map of New York by county. \nCHARLIE \n(NATURAL OPTIMIST) Better than I thought, I thought we'd get killed in Seneca. He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen Norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops. \nDavid stands alone looking out at the empty room. Trying to get used to it. It's not easy. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nDavid enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row of sinks. He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his pocket. He twirls them in his hands for a moment. Then tosses them into the trash can. He looks at himself in the mirror, fighting to hold himself together. A sound behind him. David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one of the stalls. She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an expensive bottle of champagne. \nWOMAN Hi. I hope I didn't startle you. \nDAVID What are you doing in here? \nWOMAN Hiding from security. \nDAVID Oh... . What did you do? \nWOMAN Crashed a wedding. One floor up. \nDAVID It's almost midnight. They'just caught on now? \nWOMAN Ivana Trump finally realized I wasn't her niece. I think after the fifth; glass of champagne my Czech accent started slipping. spite of David's state that gets a grin. \nDAVID Are you for real? \nWOMAN Life is short. \nDAVID Hard to argue with that. \nWOMAN You're that guy running for Senate aren't you? \nDAVID I'm \"that guy.\" \nWOMAN You winning? \nDAVID No. \nWOMAN Too bad. The other guy's a tool. \nDAVID \n(LAUGHS) Maybe I should have made that clearer in my ads. \nWOMAN Personally, I think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal. \n(BEAT) And I don't think the Post should have printed the photo. David just shakes his head. He will never, ever live that down and he knows it. \nWOMAN At least not full page. He can't help but crack up. \nWOMAN Listen, I've done it. \nDAVID You weren't running, for Senate at the time. \nWOMAN Do you still have a chance or is it over? \nDAVID He crushed me. She has beautiful eyes. And an exceptional gift for conveying empathy... \nWOMAN You must ...I don't know what you must be feeling... \nDAVID Winning would feel better. But losing has its advantages. \nWOMAN Like what? \nDAVID The only time a politician is alone is when he's asleep.. .or in the bathroom. After eight years in politics that gets kind of hard to take. She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look. \nWOMAN Watching you, you'd never know it. The way she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows she sees what others miss in him -- even if he isn't even quite sure what it is. Not yet. \nDAVID Thank you... \nWOMAN Well, everything happens for a reason, right? Even losing. God, I'm really rollrng out the platitudes tonight, aren't I? \nDAVID It's the champagne. Brines out the Hallmark in people. \nWOMAN After it kills their Czech accents. She offers:him the bottle. He hesitates, then takes it. \nDAVID Why not? I have to think up some good platitudes for my speech. He takes a gulp of champagne. \nWOMAN Why the hell would you do that? \nDAVID Apparently, even if I hadn't been caught dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign I would have lost the election anyway because I'm too blunt. \nWOMAN (swig of champagne) Says who? \nDAVID The TV pundits. \nHARRY Two weeks. Richardson claps him din-the shoulder and leaves. Harry watches him go. \nINT. BEDROOM -- MORNING \nAn alarm clock reads \"5:44 airy.\" It turns to \"5:45\" and the alarm goes off. A hand reaches over and taps the alarm off. FOLLOW the arm back to David Norris in a king-sized bed. He rubs his eyes, stretches his neck, and climbs out of bed. \nINT. EQUINOX GYM. -- MORNING \nDavid works out. He's got the-energy-level of a 25 year-old. He runs on a treadmill. Hits the heavy bag. Does sit-ups. \nINT.

He's going to ask you about joining the firm. My compliance guys say all firm business has to be done on the blackberry. \nDAVID Really? \nCHARLIE Sarbanes-Oxley. You voted for it, pal. In fact, you cosponsored it. \nEXT. STARBUCKS -- MORNING \nThrough the window we see David getting his morning coffee. He exits and LEAVES FRAME. HOLD on the door of Starbucks. \nEXT.

Harry keeps running after it. \nHARRY No... \nINT. BUS -- MORNING \nAs David walks down the aisle a couple of passengers recognize his face. . .but they don't say anything. David nears an empty aisle seat. A woman is curled up in the window seat, sleeping. She wears a funky mini-dress, knee- high argyle socks under leather boots, and a (clashing) argyle bucket cap. David sits next to her. And stares. \nDAVID No way... It's the woman from election night.', He leans around to try to see the front of her face. \"It's definitely her. His eyes drift down at her legs. Just then she opens her eyes. She recoils for a second;. Then` her eyes soften when she realizes who it is. \nINT. BUS -- MORNING \nDavid's phone rings again. As he reaches for the phone he fumbles his coffee cup, the lid comes off, and a slosh of coffee crests the brim and splashes on the woman's dress. \nDAVID Oh, Jesus... \n(FIGHTING LAUGHTER) I'm sorry. \nEXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH -- MORNING \nHarry's face. \nHARRY Shit! He's looking at a leather portfolio. We catch a glimpse inside: a complicated circuit diagram.

He pulls out his wallet. There's $7 inside. She laughs. \nWOMAN Hope your new job pays better than your old one. \nDAVID Give me your number and I'll send you a check. \nWOMAN God, that is smooth. Spill coffee on me then ask for my number. She takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip, then turns back to him with a devilish look in her eyes. \nWOMAN Just let me spill some on you and we'll be even. She thrusts the cup toward his tie. David parries. \nDAVID It's my first day at the office! \nWOMAN Tell your boss some crazy chick dumped coffee on you on the MI. It's New York; he'll understand. She thrusts the cup back at him- \nDAVID No! He grabs the cup with both his hands over hers. \nWOMAN \n(ACTUALLY PLEADING) Come on. Just a little. They struggle with the cup. <,;:Both suppressing laughter. \nDAVID You're crazy. Actually crazy. The phone on David's lap'RINGS again. She snatches it with her free hand. \nWOMAN \n(INTO PHONE) He's not here! She hangs up. \nDAVID Who was that? She shrugs. Sorry, pal. He lunges for his phone, but she holds it on the other side of her body. \nDAVID What is this, third grade? \nWOMAN You forgot what that was like, didn't you? How fun it was... That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS again. \nWOMAN Oh my God! How do you stand it? She drops the phone into the coffee. \nWOMAN There. We're even. He stares at her. Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows what would come next if they were in private... The fourth RING gurgles up through the coffee. A beat. \nWOMAN Sturdy little fucker, isn't it? She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her scarf, pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail. Then she reaches out her hand, as if to shake. \nWOMAN By the way, I'm Elise. \nEXT. UNION SQUARE -- DAY \nElise exits.. the bus. David stands at the bus door watching her. She turns back to look at him. \nDAVID The morning after .I lost I woke up thinking about you . That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops. \nINT. BUS -- MORNING \nMoments later. Through the window, David watches Elise walking down the sidewalk. Their eyes meet. She blows him a little kiss before she turns the corner. His heart skips a beat as the bus continues on down Union Square East. \nEXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING \nHarry runs through Union Square bee-lining for David's bus. \nINT. BUS -- MORNING \nDavid looks at Elise's number, scribbled on a piece of paper. He carefully tucks her number into his wallet. Then takes the most satisfying sip of coffee he's ever had in his life-- \nEXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING \nSpotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus-- \nINT. BUS -- MORNING \nJust as David finishes his sip the-plastic lid pops off the cup. A second earlier and the coffee would have poured all over his shirt. Instead it spills: on the floor. \nDAVID Jesus! Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the \"security guards\" who chased Elise away on election night. \nDAVID (,.CONT'D) What the hell are you doing?! Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then: \nRICHARDSON Grab him! David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him-- \nINT. RSR OFFICE FLOOR -- MORNING \nDavid sprints toward the door he came in. It closes as he gets there. He grabs it. It's locked. He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges from a door in the middle of the hallway. \nDavid jumps a mile. It's physically impossible that Richardson could have gotten there that fast. \nRICHARDSON You can't get away, David. David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last five steps and hits the floor hard. As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is frozen solid. David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall. Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast-- David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT... FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of the large corner offices on the 40th floor. The nameplate reads \"Steve Kincaid.\" Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David, \nINSIDE -- Except when they walk through the door they're not in an office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step inside a large warehouse... Their movement completely violates the laws of physics. \nBLACK SCREEN Silence. Then voices come up slowly: \nRICHARDSON (O.S.) Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I understand that, sir. Absolutely. I'll do that, sir. \n(BEAT) What a goddamm mess. \nMCCRADY (O.S.) Was that Donaldson? \nRICHARDSON (O.S.) Yes. \nMCCRADY (O.S.) What do you want to do? \nFADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVID'S POV of the warehouse David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out. A half-dozen members of the \"Intervention Team\" (the Silver Suits) stand nearby. Richardson and MCCRADY (one of the men from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away. \nRICHARDSON (O.S.) Can you reset him? \nMCCRADY (O.S.) I don't think we have the authority in a situation like this. \nRICHARDSON (O.S.) \nCALL LEGAL- \nBURDENSKY (0.S.). Legal just arrived. \nINT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nREVEAL BURDENSKY, a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit, carrying a briefcase. He.walks to Richardson. \nBURDENSKY Re-setting's off the table. This is our fault:... Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself off to the side, clearly disgraced. David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson, cranes around to see who's talking. \nDAVID Hey. The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume. \nRICHARDSON What are my options? \nBURDENSKY \n(IGNORING DAVID) You could bullshit him but you'll never be completely successful. \nDAVID Can somebody tell me what's going on? \nBURDENSKY (still ignoring him) The questions will burn in him till the day he dies. You'll have to monitor him constantly... \nON DAVID He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying-- \nBURDENSKY (PARTIALLY AUDIBLE) .to make sure he doesn't talk... the endless ripple effects... REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him. \nON THE SUITS \nBURDENSKY If it were me, I'd level with him. \nRIC:HARDSON Completely? \nBURDENSKY That's the only way to extinguish his curiosity. Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him. An uncomfortable pause. \nDAVID Who are you guys? \nRICHARDSON We're the people v ho make sure things happen according to Plan. David stares back at him for a moment. then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse. Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand-- \nCLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR It cracks.. .and displaces upward.. .so it's uneven just as David's foot comes down on it. \nBACK TO WIDE SHOT David trips and goes flying-- \nMOMENTS LATER David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed back in his chair in front of Richardson. \nRICHARDSON Did you really think I couldn't see that coming? David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nDavid exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him. He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts walking to the corner to orient himself. Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO. \nINT. BROOKLYN COCKTAIL LOUNGE -- AFTERNOON \nDavid sits alone at the bar. His hand trembles slightly. \nBARTENDER You're David Norris, right? \nDAVID Ice water. \nBARTENDER That's it? David nods. Harry arrives. \nHARRY We should talk. But not here. Go back to work and I'll contact you later today with a place to meet. \nDAVID Okay. Harry can see that David is still very shaken. \nHARRY The world's exactly the same as it's always been. You just understand it more completely now. \n(BEAT) Hang on to what mattered before you knew any of this and you'll be fine. \nEXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- DAY \nA thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters. \nINT. RSR OFFICES -- DAY \nDavid enters. Stares at,,hisnew colleagues going about their business as if nothing happened. \nINT. 40TH FLOOR --:DAY \nDavid stands in ftontof the corner office labeled \"Steve Kincaid.\" He hesitates, then opens it. He sees an empty office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor. It's strangely disorienting for him. \nSECRETARY(O.S.) Mr. IKincaid's in the finance meeting, Congressitan. Main conference room. David turns to see her. \nDAVID Thanks. David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new reality he now knows. Charlie comes around a corner. \nCHARLIE There you are. I called your cell ten times. You left me hanging. \nDAVID Sorry... \nCHARLIE (seeing the look in \nDAVID'S EYES) Are you okay? (off David's nod) Come on, we're late. Happy first day by the way. They head towards the conference room. \nCHARLIE You sure you're okay. \nDAVID Fine. How about you? \nCHARLIE Great. Why? \nDAVID No headaches or-- \nCHARLIE I feel fantastic, -man.

DAVID'S OFFICE -- DAY \nDavid hesitates. It's like his friend is an alien.. .but then again he's totally normal. \nDAVID I lost her number. \nCHARLIE You lost her number? \nDAVID (searching for something) I was pickpocketed. \nCHARLIE Come on. You can't be serious. (off David's look) You're serious... Oh, man...dude. I'm sorry... I'm really sorry... \nEXT. PIER -- ADJACENT TO WEST SIDE HIGHWAY -- DAY \nHuge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now. \nINT. BEDROOM -- MORNING \nAn alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's already awake, staring at the ceiling... After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it off. But then just lies there... \nINT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MORNING \nIt's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed. No files on the table, like there were the last time we were here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study. \nCHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) How are you feeling about the speech? David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice: \nDAVID I'm ready... I changed a few things last night. \nCHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) Tell me at breakfast. \nTHROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door. \nEXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING \nDavid exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different. \nINT. BUS -- MORNING \nDavid enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat. \nINT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING \nDavid stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus. DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk. \nDavid's head whips around, only able to see her from the back now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same eclectic style. He slams the red \"next stop\" strip, jumps to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus. \nDAVID Stop the bus. \nDRIVER The next stop-- \nDAVID Now. \nEXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING \nThe bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He catches up to her at University Place. \nDAVID Elise! The woman turns around.

Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then: \nDAVID (from the heart) I rode the Ml to work every day for the last three years hoping one day I'd run into you again. She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it. \nELISE Calling would have been easier. \nDAVID I couldn't. \nELISE Girlfriend wouldn't let you? \nDAVID No girlfriend. She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his expression is dead serious. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Can we go somewhere and talk? She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at herself for that, but it's the truth. \nELISE (re: his suit) Don't you have to get to work? \nDAVID I just got sick. \nELISE \"I haven't seen you in three years - - You make me sick\" is not an ideal come-on. For the record. David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket. \nDAVID One second. \n(PICKING UP) CharlieT can't make breakfast. \nCHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) Why not? \nDAVID And...I might have to push the speech. \nCHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) What? Are you crazy?! \nDAVID I just ran into Elise. He hangs up. \nELISE You just hung up on your best friend. \nINT. BOATHOUSE RESTAURANT -- DAY \nDAVID How did you find me? \nCHARLIE Does it matter? \n(TO ELISE) \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Elise, pleasure to see you again. \n(TO DAVID) There's a crowd of people standing around downtown waiting for you. \nELISE Your speech? \nCHARLIE He's announcing today. \nELISE At the speech? \nDAVID It's okay. \nCHARLIE What's okay? It's not okay. The one thing you can't be this. time around is impulsive. That's why we're announcing the way we are, \nTHAT'S WHY-- \nELISE God, don't skip this for me. \nDAVID I told you I'm not letting you out of my sight. \nCHARLIE David, what the hell? \nDAVID (to Elise, realizing a way out of his dilemma) Come with me. Come and watch. \nELISE \n(SMILING) Okay. Her phone buzzes with a text message. \nCHARLIE (to both of them) Great. Perfect solution. Now, let's pay and get you over there. Charlie waves the waiter over to give them the check. \nELISE Now? \nCHARLIE The speech is in 30 minutes. \nELISE I can't then. (indicating text message) They just moved my dress rehearsal to noon. David's own sixth sense kicks in. Has he been discovered? \nDAVID We can reschedule the speech. \nELISE David! \nCHARLIE \n(TO ELISE) Thank you. David looks around for anything out of the ordinary, any sign of Richardson or his men. But. they stay out of view. He thinks they're not on to him yet. \nELISE I'll meet you right after the rehearsal. \nDAVID Where does your company perform? \nELISE We're n in our space. There was a`;\u00e2\u0080\u00a2power ot outage or something. (checking the text) We're using a space\" on Murray and West Broadway today. \nCHARLIE \n(REALIZING) That's four blocks from where you're speaking. David reacts: Richardson can't be behind that. \nCHARLIE You can literally walk there after the speech. David nods, his suspicions fading. \nCHARLIE \n(CHECKING WATCH) But we've got to leave right now. \nEXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY \nRichardson and his team watch as David, convinced now he's still undiscovered, stands up and heads to the door with Charlie and Elise. \nMCCRADY The \"four blocks\" thing was a brilliant move, boss. \nRICHARDSON (putting his hat on) We're not out of the woods yet. He looks down at the inflection points in McCrady's Planbook. \nINT. BAR AREA -- DAY \nDavid and Charlie and Elise walk:toward the side. entrance. \nELISE \nCHARLIE \"What is it about her? \nDAVID \n(BEAT) I don't know... \nEXT.

ELISE'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nElise changes into her dance gear. Big smile on her face. She spots something on her bookshelf (we can't see what) and her smile fades.

David knows it. But-- \nDAVID This is different. Trust me, it's different. David leaves. \n(COVERING) 'It's not something your mind could :comprehend. \nDAVID You're in a nice suit but the reality is you're just a minion aren't you?

Suddenly Richardson emerges from a storefront and, goes to David. \nRICHARDSON Maybe you should try the subway.

I want you in my life-- \nELISE There are skeletons in my closet, David. The kind that-- \nDAVID Listen to me-- \nELISE The kind that people use against-- \nDAVID Elise, listen! I don't care. We'll work it out... I've spent my whole life wondering why it takes auditoriums of people to fill the empty space inside me. Then I met you...and realized it doesn't. She looks at him.

STUDIO -- DAY \nDavid stays to speak to Diane for a moment-as we MOVE to find a stagehand'who is shifting the position of one of the big video cameras sed to tape the show. We catch a glimpse of his face and see it's Thompson's aide. INT<. Gk 2N- R0014 -- DAY The- \"stagehand\" moves thecamera so it's blocking the window giving Elise line-of sight to David and Diane. Just. then a man with an-.ABC ID enters the room to speak to Elise. (We only see his lower half.) \nABC ID Ma'am, Congressman Norris asked me to give you a message. We MOVE UP from his ID to REVEAL that the man is another one of Thompson's aides. \nTHOMPSON AIDE #2 (ABC ID) He was just called into a meeting that he says is urgent.

Definitely. David is looking at a text from Elise as he speaks. It says: \"I want to go to bed with you.\" \nDIANE SAWYER They're saying she's getting a tour of the control room in studio C. Can somebody take Congressman Norris to studio C? Thompson's aide signals David to follow him. David does. They walk through a couple thick doors into the corridor. \nINT.

It's locked. \nDAVID God dammit! \nINT. CORRIDOR -- DAY \nThrough the thick window of the outer door we can see David pounding on the window of the inner door. But we can't hear a sound.

His tie..loose now. His jacket off. He glances at his blackberry. the time reads 4:13 pm. He yells in frustration. \nVOICE If people could hear you out there it wouldn't be a very good soundstage, would it? David turns to see Thompson, in the now familiar dark suit and fedora. \nTHOMPSON My name's Thompson. \nDAVID What happened to Free Will? \nTHOMPSON Who said anything about Free Will? David stares back at him. \nTHOMPSON You know, we actually tried Free Will before. After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the Roman Empire we stepped back to see how you'd do on your own. You gave us the Dark Ages -- for five centuries -- until finally we: decided we should come back in. \n(BEAT) The Chairman thought maybe we just needed to do a better job of teaching you how to ride the bike before we took the training wheels off again. So we gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revoluton.:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwe spent six hundred years tempering your passions with reason.,then in 1910 we stepped ba \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdc again. Within fifty years\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdyou brought us World War I, the lepre'ssion, Fascism, the Holocaust ani capped it off by bringingtheentire planet to the brink of destruction in the Cuban Missile Crisis. A decisiOfl was taken atthat point that we' should stop in again before \u00c2\u00b1ou did _soittething even we Cduldn't fix. \n(BEAT) You on't have_ Free Will, David, you have the appearance of Free =Will. \nDAVID You expect me.'to believe that? \nTHOMPSON \n(BORED SHRUG) You have Free Will over what tie you pick in the morning, or what beverage to order at lunch. But humanity just isn't mature enough to have control over the important things. \nDAVID If you're in control of the important things then you're incompetent cause when I look around at the world these days it seems pretty fucked. \nTHOMPSON It's still here. If we'd left things in your hands, it wouldn't be. \nDAVID Why are you trying to keep me from Elise? Or are you just another lackey who doesn't really know? Thompson studies David for a long beat. Then decides it's time to level with him. \nTHOMPSON We put Elise in front of you three years ago to inspire you to, .g `ve that speech -- the speech that pulled you back from the brink of oblivion and, overnight, itiade.you the front runner for this coming election. The intervention on Charlie was to prevent the hedge fund you had just become vice chairman of from going belly up in the sub-prime=crisis, bringing two major banks down. with it, arid in , the process making you unelectable. David blinks. Tries to, process this... : .bAVID Are you s aying you warit me to win this election? \nTHOMP50N, This 'one and six mom, after it. And t'm not just talking about `elections ' for Senate. lowly dawns on David what Thompson is saying... \nTHOMPSON You can matter, David. Really matter. What you wanted your whole life. What your father wanted when he took you to the Senate gallery when you were ten. What your brother wanted when he made you promise, the day before he overdosed, that you wouldn't be like him. \nDAVID Stop. Don't tell me this. \nTHOMPSON Why do you think you have that yearning to be in front of people. . .and that terrible emptiness when you're not? \nDAVID Stop. \nTHOMPSON David you are meant to change the world. But that doesn't happen if you stay with her. \nINT BACK STAGE -- NIGHT .A company staff member is examining Elise's ankle while the show goes on. David arrives. Sees Elise's face. Tears streaming down her cheeks. Seeing David... \nELISE If it's broken...my career's over. \nDAVID Don't say that. Don't. \nINT. TAXI -- NIGHT \nThe taxi rushes to the hospital. David holds her. Silently trying to comfort her. But he can't look at her. \nEXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT \nDavid carries her from the taxi into the emergency room... \nINT.

He looks-up to see Thompson. \nTHOMPSON I always hear people saying \"you yourself for what can't bla M4' hpens fih other people,\" but in this case, really, you can. David stands up... . and punnhesThompson in `the face. h T ompson is knocked onto his ass. People in the waiting room stare at David. Almost everyone here knows his fade. He looks at them, unable to summon his usual wit. \nTHOMPSON This is what you do, David. \n(GETTING UP) This is what you did the first night you got elected. This is what you did at that college reunion. We give you opportunities people would kill for and you squander them with impulse. It doesn't take a genius to see Elise isn't exactly going to help you with that. \n(MORE) \nTHOMPSON (CONT'D) You want to know why you can't have her? Look in the mirror. Thompson leaves. \nINT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT \nMore X-rays of Elise's ankle. An orthopedic surgeon enters and examines the images on the computer screen. Elise, her face, still red and tear stained tries to read the \nSURGEON'S FACE \nELISE How bad is it? The surgeon turns to her with a classic doctor's detachment: \nSURGEON \nELISE-- \nEXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD -- NIGHT \nDavid sits alone on a bench. Thompson arrives. \nTHOMPSON You're an educated man. You've read the Greek tragedies`. In the end Fate always wins... David looks back at him in steely silence. \nTHOMPSON It a sprain. \nDAVID Really? \nTHOMPSON This time. \n(BEAT') Do you really want to watch her lose the only thing she's ever cared about? You just got the tiniest taste of what that looks like... The thought makes David ill. \nTHOMPSON Walk away. If you truly love her, walk away. She'll hate you for it...but that way she'll be able to let you go quickly. You can give her that at least. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT \nDavid stands alone. Stares at the floor. Finally confronting the fact that he can't beat the forces arrayed against him. Finally ready to make the choice being forced upon him... \nINT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- DAY \nDavid enters to find Elise with a huge smile on her face. \nELISE It's a sprain! It's just a sprain! David gives her a tight hug. \nELISE It's going to be okay. The doctor said it would heal in' a month. . .maybe even less. \nDAVID You're going to: be fine. \nELISE They want to do an MRI...to assess the ligament. damage but.: -. They break from them hug. \nDAVID It's; going to be fine. And as incredible of a dancer as you already are, yot're just going to get better and better... DavidV;embraces her again, so she won't see the tears welling in his eyes. \n(BEAT) I guess I'm here to set the record straight. \nDAVID About what? \nHARRY- Thompson was lying when he said they couldn't let you be with 8lise because :it would bring out your reckless side. \nDAVID Why, then? Why do they care so much? \nHARRY 8ecause.,..she's enough, David. If you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to fill the d side you with votes and ataplause'and dreams of one day becoming p sident... if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul. \nHARRY I've watched you a long time. They're right to want you in the White House. It would be good for the world. That's important but it can't be the only thing that matters. \nDAVID Why are you so different than they are? \nA long beat, then: \nHARRY You know, your Dad was a smart man. He could have been a lot more -- and he wanted to be. So did your brother. But the Plan didn't call for that. This hits David hard. \nHARRY In my job, you implement the Plan... \n(EMOTIONAL) And most of the time.. .you don't even know why... \n(BEAT) I'm sorry... \nDAVID My mom? \nHARRY That wasn't me... that wasn't us at all. David takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink. Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes a drink as well. \nDAVID When Thompson told methe choice as Elise or the White House I barely hesitated. \nD1 ID But the trt t i `is after making that choice I went into a free-fall... Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to see Thompson hurt her...but I used it as an excuse. I think I left her more to save my career than hers. \n(STRUGGLING) Thompson wasn't lying. The press is already talking about me as a future president. I'm phoning in my speeches and I'm still sixteen points up in the polls. \nHARRY The public loves you. \nDAVID Before I met Elise that was all that mattered. Now I hardly notice. She's all I think about. \n(BEAT) Do you know where she's getting married? \nHARRY Front of a judge. Tomorrow morning. \nDAVID Is she happy with him? Tell me she is and I'll walk away. \nHARRY Thompson won't let you get near that courthouse. \nDAVID Harry... is she happy? \nHARRY No. A beat. \nDW-ID I have to get her back.. Harry knows how unlikely that is. \nDAVID Will you help me:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Just help me get to her... \nHARDY They'll sense )tOu coming a mile away.' \nDAVID What if Icould move as fast as you can? \nHARRY What do you mean? \nDAVID Teach me about the doors. \nHARRY How do you know about that? \nDAVID The first day, after they caught me, they carried me through one.I thought it was a hallucination at first. Eventually I realized it's how you move around so fast. (off Harry's reluctance) If you don't want to help me because of what they'll do to you...okay, that's your choice. But if this is about protecting me then shouldn't the choice be mine? \nHARRY Do you have any idea how complicated it is to navigate through those doors... how many thousands of permutations there are in even a simple several block journey? \nDAVID You know, when I do town hall meetings I usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when I walk, through' the door and when I start speaking. But when I'm done with the speech I can call on each one of them by `game. A beat... \nHARRY I've seen you do that (taking tl leap ) The rain is supposed to stop in the nexthou'r. We're going to need all night to do this. And we're going to need aplace surrounded by water to do it. \nMOMENTS LATER Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the end of the pier. Harry dons his hat. \nHARRY Put your hand on my shoulder. And don't let go until we've crossed the threshold. \nDavid complies. Harry opens the door. \nDAVID Are they ever locked? \nHARRY Maybe if you have a defective hat. They step through the door and onto-- \nDavid rubs his head. He's exhausted-too. Mentally. \nHARRY Yourbrain can only put so much in at once. Take- a brreak. Da :} , nods. His eyg6,0s' to: Harry' s leather Planbook. He btio#ts to it -- a question: can he look at it., Harry opens tt up to a page in the middle. David's eyes look over the impossibly complex circ$t diagram. \nDAVID Could I ever learn to read that? Harry shakes his head. Impossible. \nDAVID No matter how hard I tried? \nHARRY For the same reason you can't breathe underwater or flap your arms and fly. You're not built to do it. \nDAVID (re: circuit diagram) Is that me? \nHARRY Elise. Her decision tree. What it was a few hours ago, before the rain, before we were down here. David looks at it, then looks away. \nDAVID I want to ask you what it says.. .what she's thinking.. .bit somehow that feels ...wrong. \nHARRY You know what she's thinkin-g,'David -- as much as you need to know. The rest ...well...you're`built to feel that. \nEXT. DANCE COMPANY -- NIGHT \nElise exits to the street, pulls a scarf around her neck.. \nINT.

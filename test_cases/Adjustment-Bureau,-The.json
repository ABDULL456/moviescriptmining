{"test1_input": "THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU \nWritten by \nGeorge Nolfi \nBased on a short story by \nPhilip K Dick \nBLACK SCREEN \nThe sounds of a large crowd, but muffled, as if we're inside, and hearing the crowd through a window or door. FADE IN ON: \nINT. SOME SORT OF LOBBY -- DAY \nDAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down, thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and confident. Content. Completely in his element. In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside: \nVOICE ON PA SYSTEM Thank you so much for coming today-- A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David. \nBLUE BLAZER Congressman Norris-? Now REVEAL that we're \u00c2\u00b1fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building at St. Johns University. A thousand people crowd the quad out front. \"Norris for Senate\" placards everywhere. \nBLUE-BLAZER Fred O'Malley with the DNC. I've never seen a crowd this big turn out so early in the cycle. CHARLIE TRAYNOR, 36, arrives--. \nCHARLIE Just wait 'till you see how they respond to him.. David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State. \nDAVID Don't build me up like that, Charlie. He'll be disappointed. \nEXT. ST. JOHNS UNIVERSITY -- MAIN QUAD -- DAY \nThe crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of the Admin Building. \nDAVID Hi there. I'm David Norris. And I'm running for the US Senate. \nThe crowd goes wild. \nMONTAGE -- SENATE CAMPAIGN --David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation. The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing ovation. --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning. --Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby. --David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin redevelopment of an old military base upstate. --He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to follow him. Especially young people. --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it. --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie stands nearby watching him speak:. \nINT. SHERATON HOTEL ROOM --UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- DUSK \nDavid enters his hotel room. The silence contrasts starkly with the noisy energy of the campaign trail. He turns on the TV. Scrolls through the channels. After a moment shuts it off. Total silence again. It bothers him. He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and meetings across the state. He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open Space Initiative. \nDAVID \n(TESTING HIMSELF) Karen Woods, founder. Husband: Bob. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Kids: Samantha, painting, and Ricky, Little League. John Pascal. Wife: Anna. St. John's grad. Two year old: Loyita... He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days out. \nDAVID \n(MORE TESTING) Abagail \"Abby\" Best, Stuart Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan Sabovic, Jim Vargas... His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning. He doesn't need to review. It's already all there. He closes his itinerary file. Goes to the window and looks out at the trees. The silence back...it's deafening. \nINT. SHERATON LOBBY -- UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT \nCharlie enters the lobby. Stops suddenly: spots David, holding court at`the hotel bar. Fifteen strangers around him as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's clearly losing his voice. Charlie walks over, pulls him aside. \nCHARLIE What the hell? What happened to \"I'm going to have softie tea, rest my voice, and go to bed early?\" You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and you have to be up at four AM for us to make it in time. David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand he picks up a cup and saucer. \nDAVID I had some tea. (sees Charlie's not in the \nMOOD) Come on, man. We're eight points up in the polls. I've gotta cut loose every once in a while and have a life. This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like having a life to him... \nCHARLIE Ten. \nDAVID What? \nCHARLIE Latest poll has you ten points up. A slow smile spreads across David's face. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK SCREEN The sound of a busy room. Then one voice, much louder: \nCAMPAIGN AIDE. County reporting: 8901 for Lynfield, 7233 for Norris. \nINT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT \nCharlie Traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that. She's writing vote totals onto a map of New York by county. \nCHARLIE \n(NATURAL OPTIMIST) Better than I thought, I thought we'd get killed in Seneca. He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen Norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. ROOFTOP NEAR WALDORF -- NIGHT \nA light snow falls. Four MEN IN CONSERVATIVE SUITS, overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story building. Their clothing is more timeless than old- fashioned. And somehow so is their demeanor. The men get to the edge and look down over the city, almost- as if it's their domain. \nINT. WALDORF HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT \nDavid watches the election coverage on TV. Pundits are discussing the New York Senate race, which CNN has already called for David's opponent. \nPUNDIT #1 Congressman Norris has a reputation for being very direct, even blunt, in his campaign speeches, which is great until you say too many things you wish you hadn't. Then you start to look like an amateur. \nPUNDIT #2 That's bad for any candidate but it's fatal if you're running for Senate at the age of 33, your opponent keeps calling you an \"impulsive kid,\" and you almost killed your entire political career five months ago with an act of immaturity that ended up on the front page of`.the New York Post. David winces slightly. This is excruciating. Just then Charlie enters.. The nerve center.suite is visible through the open door behind him. \n-CHARLIE Why are you still watching CNN? They called this way too early. David doesn't share his friend's optimism. \nINT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE'-- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT \nA' campaign aide with a phone to her ear shouts to the room: \nAIDE Suffolk County Numbers! Charlie and David emerge from the private room to listen. \nAIDE (O.S.) Lynfield: 415,120. Norris: \nCharlie's energy and optimism disappear instantly. \nCHARLIE (after long beat) I really thought we'd win Suffolk. \nA senior aide walks over. \nSENIOR AIDE Kings County just came in too. \nA BRUTAL He shows a piece of paper to Charlie and David. beat... \nDAVID Well, it's over. And it's going to be a blowout... David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going to lose big. It's going to be a grand,. public humiliation. \nSENIOR AIDE NBC has us up next. Charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest TV to NBC. \nBRIAN WILLIAMS Turning now to the New York Senate race, NBC is now calling the election for Roger'Lynfield. After a shockingly poor showing in both Suffolk county and in his home county, Kings, it now appears that David Norris will lose this election badly, perhaps by as much as 10 points. \nEXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT \nThe four men in dark suits.. The boss's name is RICHARDSON, early 40s. His top aide is.AHARRY, 50s. \nRICHARDSON This is a.bignight, gentleman. \n(TOHARRY) Is ever ything set? Harry nods. Richardson notices his eyes: \nRICHARDSON You look tired. You should take a vacation when we finish with this. You'll have earned it. \nHARRY I'm not sure the kind of tired I feel would be fixed by a vacation. \nRICHARDSON Sure it would. Everybody needs a vacation. Even us. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE -- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT \nThe staff and supporters in here have become very quiet. Their candidate is standing in the middle of the room, but no one can look at him. And David can't look at them either... \nDAVID \n(TO CHARLIE) I'm going to take a walk, figure out my speech. \nINT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT \nFour-hundred campaign workers follow election news on big screens in the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom. No one says a word. The mood has gone from.hopeful to funereal in sixty seconds. \nINT. WALDORF LOBBY -- NIGHT \nDavid slips through the lobby with only a few looks from the staff. But when he.gets to the door he sees that press vans line the front of the hotel. There will be no peace for him if he steps out there. He turns around. \nASSISTANT MANAGER Good evening, Congressman. You're in the Grand Ballroom if that's what you're looking for. \nDAVID Actually just looking for a place to be alone for a minute before I head in there. \nASSISTANT MANAGER None of the banquet rooms on the third floor are in use tonight. \nDAVID Thank you. \nINT.

STUDIO -- DAY \nDAVID I think Americans are tired of electing automatons whose every word and move is stage-managed so as not to offend anyone.

I guess I'm hoping they want to elect someone who's actually like them. \n(LAUGHS) But I could be very wrong about that. \nDIANE SAWYER And if you are? \nDAVID You'd be surprised at the number of underwear companies that have approached me to be their spokesman.

David stares back at him. \nTHOMPSON You know, we actually tried Free Will before. After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the Roman Empire we stepped back to see how you'd do on your own. You gave us the Dark Ages -- for five centuries -- until finally we: decided we should come back in. \n(BEAT) The Chairman thought maybe we just needed to do a better job of teaching you how to ride the bike before we took the training wheels off again.

But humanity just isn't mature enough to have control over the important things. \nDAVID If you're in control of the important things then you're incompetent cause when I look around at the world these days it seems pretty fucked. \nTHOMPSON It's still here. If we'd left things in your hands, it wouldn't be. \nDAVID Why are you trying to keep me from Elise? Or are you just another lackey who doesn't really know? Thompson studies David for a long beat.

What your brother wanted when he made you promise, the day before he overdosed, that you wouldn't be like him. \nDAVID Stop. Don't tell me this. \nTHOMPSON Why do you think you have that yearning to be in front of people. . .and that terrible emptiness when you're not? \nDAVID Stop. \nTHOMPSON David you are meant to change the world.

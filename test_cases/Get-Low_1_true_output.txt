ANNOUNCER I'll take a ticket. 
BUDDY You're betting on a man dying.. 
ANNOUNCER I didn't mean it like.. 
FRANK Hey, it's his idea! They look at Bush who has taken off the headset and looking at it like he wants to take it home. 
FRANK It's what you want, right? 
BUSH 
(TO BUDDY) Buy a ticket, son. 
68 INT. DARROW HOUSE - SAME 6 8 
Mattie puts the vase of flowers on table with a group of family photographs. The picture beside the vase is the SAME PHOTOGRAPH of the beautiful woman that Bush has. Is it Mattie? It looks a little like her. 
INSERT PHOTO: The BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN stares at us as we PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we are now looking at the identical photo tacked to Bush's wall.

70 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - LATE DAY 70 
Bush starts out of the barn, draws back, and peeks through the wall boards: A FIGURE approaches. He jerks.. REVEAL Mattie walking 
BUSH Mattie? 
MATTIE Felix? Mattie enters, straining to see into the barn. Her eyes adjust to find him standing near Mule. She is startled and pleased by his new do. 
MATTIE Look at you. I wondered if you were still under that beard. 
BUSH Wasn't nowhere else to go. 
MATTIE I heard you on the radio. 
BUSH Well. 
MATTIE You've gotten downright chatty. 
BUSH I reckon so. 
MATTIE 
(GLANCING AROUND) This is nice. I drove by a few times after I got back but.. 
BUSH You want to see it? 
MATTIE Do you want me to? 
71 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY 71 
The first stop on the tour is a small fenced grave site near the shack. Three grave markers with names carved into them: 
KEEPER, CHARLIE, MAUDE. Bush is squatting down staring at the markers. Mattie stands close beside him. Since his attention is elsewhere she looks at him in an unguarded way. Her mind is full of questions, old and new. 
BUSH You always know where you stand with a dog. Want to lay here with them someday if they'll have me.

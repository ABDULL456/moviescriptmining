JOEL It's okay, really. 
CLEMENTINE Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me. (sits across aisle from Joel) How far are you going?  On the train, I mean, of course. 
JOEL Rockville Center. 
CLEMENTINE Get out!  Me too!  What are the odds? 
JOEL The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you.  I thought that earlier in the diner.  That's why I was looking at you.  You work at Borders, right? 
CLEMENTINE Ucch, really?  You're kidding.  God. Bizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now. 
JOEL Really?  Because -- 
CLEMENTINE Jesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit right now. 
JOEL -- because I go there all the time.  I don't think I ever saw you before. 
CLEMENTINE Well, I'm there.  I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible.  You have a cell phone?  I need to quit right this minute.  I'll call in dead. 
JOEL I don't have one. 
CLEMENTINE I'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy before me. 
JOEL I noticed your hair.  I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you. 
CLEMENTINE Ah, the hair. (pulls a strand in front of her eyes, studies it) Blue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The color.  Snappy name, huh? 
JOEL I like it. 
CLEMENTINE Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering. 
JOEL Yeah.  Tom Waits says it in -- 
CLEMENTINE Exactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song? 
JOEL I can't remember. 
CLEMENTINE Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.  Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names.  How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole. 
JOEL I don't really know how -- 
CLEMENTINE Purple Haze, Pink Eraser. 
JOEL You think that could possibly be a full time job?  How many hair colors could there be? 
CLEMENTINE (pissy) Someone's got that job. (excited) Agent Orange!  I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it. 
JOEL I'm sure you would. 
CLEMENTINE My writing career!  Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski. (thought) The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs. 
JOEL You sure?  That doesn't sound -- 
CLEMENTINE I think.  Anyway, I've tried all their colors.  More than once.  I'm getting too old for this.  But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste.  You? 
JOEL Oh, I doubt that's the case. 
CLEMENTINE Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you? 
JOEL Sorry.  I was just trying to be nice. 
CLEMENTINE Yeah, I got it. 
There's a silence. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) My name's Clementine, by the way. 
JOEL I'm Joel. 
CLEMENTINE No jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice. 
JOEL I don't know any jokes about your name. 
CLEMENTINE Huckleberry Hound? 
JOEL I don't know what that means. 
CLEMENTINE Huckleberry Hound!  What, are you nuts? 
JOEL I'm nut nuts. 
CLEMENTINE (singing) Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine?  No? 
JOEL Sorry.  It's a pretty name, though.  It means "merciful", right? 
CLEMENTINE (impressed) Yeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

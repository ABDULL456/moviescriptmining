whimpers. Scotty balances atop the fence. Grabs the tow chain. Lifts with all his might... his fingers bleed. The Beast goes limp. An inch. That did it! The beast falls. 
SCOTTY 
goes with him - 8 feet to the dirt. The FENCE COMES DOWN - breaking the barrier to the sandlot. He lands on the ground 
NOSE TO NOSE 
with The Beast. 
SCOTTY 
leaps to his feet. 
THE BEAST 
rises with him. 
SCOTTY 
freezes solid. 
THE GANG 
watches in horror. 
THE BEAST 
scans them instinctively - He might kill them all where they stand. 
SCOTTY'S 
about to load up his fruit o' da looms. 
THE BEAST 
sticks his mammoth head right in Scotty's face. SNIFFS. That's it! The kid is lunch! His jowls part - hot BEAST-BREATH BLOWS Scotty's hair back. 
SCOTTY 
closes his eyes. 
THE GANG 
SLAP their hands to their eyesockets. 
THE BEAST 
leans closer. Mouth opens. Cold-leather nose presses against Scotty's forehead. Then... He licks Scotty's face. 
SCOTTY 
wipes away the Beast slob. He doesn't even have to kneel down to read the name on The Beast's "doggy tag." It says... 
...Hercules. 
This time Scotty gives Benny "Thumbs Up." 
UNDER THE LEAN-TO 
Hercules digs, then stands away. 
THE GANG 
steps closer. Look into the hole. Their faces light up with wonder. In 
THE HOLE 
Are 150 baseballs. 
THE GANG'S BLOWN AWAY 
BENNY We can play forever now. 
SCOTTY 
takes The Beast by the collar. He and Benny go to 
MR. MERTLE'S BACK DOOR 
Scotty KNOCKS. MR. MERTLE answers the door. An old man with dark glasses. He comes out on the porch. 
MR. MERTLE Hello?... 
SCOTTY Um, we brought your dog home. 
MR. MERTLE Hercules? How'd he get out? 
SCOTTY Well, sir... um, we kind of, well, what happened was - 
BENNY - we hit a baseball into your yard. Then we tried to get it and - 
MR. MERTLE - why didn't you just come to the door... I'd have gotten it for you. 
Squints, Yeah-Yeah, Ham, DeNunez, Repeat, Timmy and Bertram faint. 
MR. MERTLE (CONT'D) Well, thanks for bringin' him back. (BEAT) Why don't you boys come in... we can talk about baseball.

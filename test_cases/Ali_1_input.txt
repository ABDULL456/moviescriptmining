BELINDA (CONT'D) Do you want to marry her? 
ALI I follow my heart. 
BELINDA "You're following your heart"? (sarcasm falls away) That's what you do. No matter what anybody says. Or thinks. Or what it does... (pause) And what happens now? 
ALI I fight George. (after a beat) I didn't come this far to quit. 
BELINDA Neither of us did. 
Ali looks at her a moment. Then he leaves. Silence. Belinda sits on the bed. She looks up. Then she comes apart. She rips open a closet. She finds Veronica's clothes, rips them, shreds peignoirs, overturns a night table, strips the bed, smashes more furniture, throws Veronica's suitcase at the mirror. It does not break. She looks around the wrecked room. Bingham is standing there. 
BINGHAM Belinda? 
Belinda looks up, tears in her eyes. 
BINGHAM (CONT'D) You can't beat him. You can't beat him, 'cause you can't not love him. 
INT. ALI'S HOUSE, N'SELE, SHOWER - ALI - NIGHT 
under the water. It flows like silver down the contours of his face and neck. He is in that zone of concentration where the best athletes go...where the pre-motor cortex's activity dominates and facial expression becomes blank, eyes look distantly...Ali's in his domain...in the groove. 
EXT. COMPOUND, N'SELE, REAR SHOT:   ALI'S CITROEN - NIGHT 
and outriders depart. 
INT. MOBUTU'S PALACE, A SITTING ROOM - SERVANTS - NIGHT 
prepare a luxurious setting. On a platform is a large TV set. In front of it, with low tables are two large armchairs with antimacassars. At the door are Mobutu's spit-and-polish paratrooper bodyguards. They STOMP their feet to attention as... 
MOBUTU 
in his tan uniform and signature leopard-skin hat enters, followed by an entourage of aides. 
MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE (in French) We are ready, your excellent President for Life... 
MOBUTU (in French) Invite Monsieur Idi to join me now... The Banker? The American? 
MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE (in French) They are waiting in the sitting room. 
INT. ALI'S DRESSING ROOM - DUNDEE 
wrapping Ali's hands, tears the tape into narrow strips to go between the fingers. Doc Broadus, from Foreman's camp, observes the wrapping, then signs it. In addition to function, the taping feels ritualistic. 
CLOSE:    ALI'S 
attention is focused elsewhere...on his action:    what he will do, his strategy. 
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA (from doorway) Countdown! Countdown! 
RUDY Countdown is on, bro.   Five minutes. 
Ali gets off the training table. Angelo has finished. He puts on his robe and starts warming up before the mirror, throwing punches for a full minute. 
HERBERT 
enters.    Ali and Herbert go to an alcove. 
ALI Thanks to Allah... (praying) 
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA (shouts) Four minutes! 
Sarria sticking sealed bottles filled with honey, orange juice and water into the water bucket. As Ali puts on the robe, the others gather up the gear, start out. Herbert moves to Ali, preparing for the entrance, to be as close to him for the cameras as possible... 
ANGELO DUNDEE Give us a moment. Alone. (off Herbert's look) Hey. This is my religion! 
Herbert and Pat Patterson, the bodyguard, with his chrome- plated .45, follow the others away from Ali. Angelo begins applying Vaseline on Ali's face. They're alone in the room. 
ANGELO DUNDEE (CONT'D) It's hot. Humid. Monsoon season's about to start. May hit 140 in the ring under the lights. You all right? 
ALI Why? 
ANGELO DUNDEE Where you at? 
ALI (looks up) Foreman ain't no mummy. He's knocked out eight out of eleven before the end of the third round. He the most dangerous fighter I ever fought. 
ANGELO DUNDEE I'd worry if I was hearin' anything else. 
Ali loosens up his neck. 
ALI And I can't WAIT! 
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA Three minutes! 
ANGELO DUNDEE Dance.   That's the most important... 
Ali looks at Dundee enigmatically.     Before Angelo can ask... 
BUNDINI 
throws towels across Ali's shoulders. Ali puts on his long African robe, which is white with African-graphic trim on the cuffs of the sleeves and the hem. 
BUNDINI (whispers) Forget every battle of man against man, of mind against mind, of soul against soul. This is the one. This is the greatest.

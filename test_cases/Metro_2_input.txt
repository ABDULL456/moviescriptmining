INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT 
Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready... No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a door. Roper races out. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it open. Gun aimed. 
INT. APT. 302 - NIGHT 
A five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he leaves. 
EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT 
Roper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk. Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches. 
INT. SOLIS OFFICE - NIGHT - RAIN 
Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone. 
SOLIS (on the phone) Yes sir. Every resource will be brought to bear. We will find this guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll tell him. 
Solis hangs up the phone. 
SOLIS The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man. 
ROPER (still looking out window) He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said... (beat; turning to Solis) I want to be put on this case. 
SOLIS I can't do that. 
ROPER (emphatic) I want to be put on this case. 
SOLIS You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it. 
ROPER Who's running it? 
SOLIS Roper... 
ROPER Who's running it! 
SOLIS Kimura and Glass will head the investigation. 
Roper turns to leave. 
SOLIS Scott. Go home. Get some sleep. 
Roper pauses at the door. Then pulls out two basketball tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office. He exits. 
CUT TO: 
INT. METRO OFFICE AREA - NIGHT 
Two detectives. A female named KIMURA and a tall guy named GLASS, try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming. 
ROPER Hey, hey, hey... 
Roper intercepts them. 
ROPER Anything on Korda so far? 
KIMURA Solis said to keep you clear of this. 
Roper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward Solis' hallway. 
ROPER I don't give a damn what Solis said. (to the detectives) If you get a lead, I want to know.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT - RAINING 
Roper's pickup drives by. 
INT. PICKUP 
Thru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers flap back and forth. His face seems dazed and lost. 
INT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Roper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard. 
RONNIE (O.S.) Just a minute. 
Roper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and earrings. 
RONNIE Hey. 
ROPER Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy. 
RONNIE (like hell) A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. (smells his breath) Jack Daniels? 
ROPER I'm not drunk. Yet. 
RONNIE Maybe you should be. 
ROPER You heard. 
She nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway. 
RONNIE Yeah. I'm sorry. 
ROPER Can I come in? 
Ronnie opens the door reluctantly. 
INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ANNA What's he doing? 
ABEL is now standing up to go look. ABEL Quiet... don't worry. It's nothing. 
ANNA tries to go back to sleep. 
INT. HALLWAYS/KID'S ROOMS - NIGHT ABEL walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall to his kids' rooms. He looks in each room and the CHILD is sleeping soundly with nothing out of place. 
INT. KIDS' ROOMS/HALLWAY- SAME TIME 
As he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down over the balcony into the living room. The dog is starting to quietly growl once again. 
ABEL'S face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to total paranoia. He slowly walks down the hall. He stops off in his bedroom closet and grabs a mid-size baseball bat/billy club. Now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying not to freak himself out. 
INT. OPEN LIVING ROOM/ENTRY HALL/FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 
ABEL walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the top, still growling every now and then. ABEL comes into the living room and everything seems perfectly normal. He then relaxes and turns towards the dog. 
ABEL Quiet. It's nothing. Come down here. 
He snaps his fingers and calls the dog. The dog finally comes down the stairs. 
ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but then the dog starts growling again and looking out the windows next to the front door. ABEL comes over, he opens the front door but the dog refuses to go out. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Go. Oh come on. Go. 
ABEL thinks he hears something. He clicks on the lights and pulls his bat back up into position. He heads outside. 
EXT. FRONT DOOR TO ABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT ABEL comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing. The dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side entrance. It is dark. The dog starts barking and going crazy. ABEL slowly heads over to the covered passageway. 
All hell now breaks lose. A BURGLAR, in all black, comes blasting out of the shadows. The dog tries to bite him as he goes by. ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the shoulder but he keeps coming. He knocks ABEL over and runs towards the driveway. ABEL is up and chasing after him faster than we expect. 
EXT. BASE OF THE RAVINE DEEP IN WOODS- CONTINUOUS 
There is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running full throttle through the very thick woods. ABEL is keeping up with him and in fact may be gaining on him. 
ABEL is still in his pajamas. He has a rage that has been building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down. They come to the top of a small ravine which ABEL seems to know from his runs through the woods and ABEL takes a bit of an easier/quicker path down. 
EXT. WOODS BEHIND ABEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
ABEL now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his legs. BURGLAR trips and goes flying. ABEL falls as he swings at him. They both sit on the ground for a beat. ABEL is exhausted. They stare at each other. 
A brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face. Then he is up again and running off into the woods. 
ABEL gets himself up and chases after him. 
EXT. ROAD NEXT TO THE WOODS - NIGHT 
ABEL comes out of the woods into the middle of the road, and in the distance we see BURGLAR run up to a waiting van with its lights and engine on. The guy gets into the passenger side of the van, and it peels out. 
ABEL is left standing in the middle of the road, barely able to breathe and holding the bat. 
EXT. ABEL FRONT DOOR - NIGHT ABEL comes walking back towards his front door. ANNA is standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next to her. She looks at him in shock. 
ANNA Where were you? 
ABEL (looking to the dog) A lot of help you were. 
ANNA Abel? 
They both look down at his bare feet. He has been in some kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice. His feet are bleeding all over the walkway. 
INT. POWDER ROOM OF ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
ANNA is in warrior mode. Any panic in her voice has disappeared, and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly seriousness. She is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting bandages on them as they talk. 
ANNA Who was it? 
ABEL What do you mean, how am I supposed to know who it was? 
She gives him a look. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I don't know. 
She gives him another look. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I think it was just some punk, looking to rip us off. 
ANNA If you... 
ABEL Ouch! If they had wanted to send a message he could have... and he didn't.

Then Max shyly opens up his front door and quickly grabs the black attaché case in front of his door 
Donning a surgical mask and latex gloves, Max opens the black attaché case. Sitting in foam is a tiny but beautiful chip. Max studies it with awe. 
MAX (V.O.) Friday, September fifth? Lots of work to be done. But I'm close, so close. Today is the day Might have cost me my soul, but down the line I'll work it out. Just keep them in the dark, let them beg. A damn Ming Mecca chip. It's like giving a desperate junkie a syringe filled with junk. Defense uses them to nun nuclear sub reactors. Me? I'm going to dissect the market. 
Max carefully carries the chip over to the new leaner Euclid. He welds it into Euclid's waiting wires. 
MAX Happy birthday, Euclid. Then he lifts his hand to slap the RETURN button, but a sudden wave of fear stops him. 
He gets up and grabs a Ginseng soda from the fridge He drops eight pills in the can. He calmly takes a sip from the soda and places it on the counter. 
Max can hear Devi and Farrouhk starting to make love. Their gentle sounds drift through the wall. 
MAX (V.O.) Eighteen thirty. Press return... Max darts over and smacks the RETURN. Moments later we see what Max sees 
ON THE SCREEN is a long string of zeros. 
At the bottom of the screen Euclid's cursor blinks, waiting for instructions. 
He smacks RETURN again Max gets the same empty result. 
Euclid's cursor blinks, waiting. Max starts to laugh. He laughs and laughs and laughs. 
MAX Oh God. Damn religious freaks. (Sarcastic) The holy Torah... But then he notices his thumb twitching. He rubs his scar. MAX Ah God... His neighbor's love sounds start to get rough. They're having fun. 
Max almost throws up. 
THE BATHROOM 
Max dry heaves in the sink. Then he forces himself to stand in front of the mirror.

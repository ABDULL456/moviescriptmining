CRAWFORD We both put down our guns.      At the same time. Crawford gestures to a chair across the room - by the foyer door, near Nunally. 
CRAWFORD We set them down and step away. (Beat) Then you can "pay more attention" to what I'm saying. Nunally studies Crawford...and the gun, hovering above the coffee table. Looking for a trick, a catch. But there isn't one. If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be standing in the open center of the room. 
CRAWFORD Happy ending, then. Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes - - then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster. Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly - the two men cautiously set down their guns - - and step away.   Crawford smiles. Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. Begins to edge forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or having another weapon. But Crawford stays absolutely still. 
NUNALLY Mr. Crawford, your neighbor mentioned that your wife - 
CRAWFORD It's Tom. 
NUNALLY I'm sorry? 
CRAWFORD You can call me Tom. 
NUNALLY Tom.   Your wife. Is she here? 
CRAWFORD Yes. Crawford gestures to a library alcove, behind him, out of view. 
NUNALLY Is she all right? Nunally begins to drift slowly to the side, to see. 
CRAWFORD I don't think she is.     I shot her, Rob. Nunally's nodding, edging to look into the alcove - 
NUNALLY You shot your wife. 
CRAWFORD It was like I just suddenly - snapped. We were arguing - and I got the gun. 
NUNALLY - okay - I hear you - 
CRAWFORD And I shot her in the head.   I know it was wrong. (Beat) Are you listening to me? But Nunally is not. He's frozen - staring, shocked, at the back wall of the alcove - which he can now see. There's a big framed black-white photograph: a portrait of Jennifer Crawford. 
NUNALLY Oh Jesus Christ. Nunally fumbles for his walkie-talkie, rushing past Crawford toward the alcove - - kneeling by Jennifer, who lies, face-up in a red puddle - 
NUNALLY (into walkie-talkie) We need a medic in here! Get the ambulance up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW! Nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse - looking in her open, vacant eyes for some sign - 
NUNALLY Oh no - God no - I can't - get a - Nunally desperately starts C.P.R., his hands getting bloody. He stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then - - as Crawford slowly approaches from the living room, standing behind Nunally. Cold. 
CRAWFORD You know, I think I read somewhere that a good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery. It's on the inner surface of the upper thigh. If you put your fingers - you know, right up inside her dress - 
Nunally turns and lunges up, smashing a fist into Crawford's face. Crawford reels backward with Nunally - - the two of them falling with Nunally on top, beating Crawford furiously, cursing - - as SWAT COPS burst in, grabbing Nunally, dragging him back - knocking into PARAMEDICS trying to get to Jennifer - - Nunally kicking, flailing, spitting at Crawford - who's put face-down on the floor, to get cuffed. Nunally pulls free from the SWAT cops, distraught, angry - going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder- holster, struggling to regain control. 
PARAMEDIC Wait a second - she's not dead! Nunally whirls - everyone freezing, breathless, falling silent. The Paramedics kneeling around Jennifer work - - as Crawford lies on the floor, staring at his wife. Like she's a machine that defied astronomical odds and refused to behave according to his calculations. 
EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER 
Jennifer's stretcher is loaded into an ambulance, doors slamming shut and sirens kicking on - - as Crawford, cuffed behind his back, is pushed into the back seat of a police car. His eyes on the ambulance as it pulls away, carrying his wife. 
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER 
A DETECTIVE uses a pencil to lift Crawford's gun from the coffee table and carefully put it in an evidence bag. Nunally stands back, watching the COPS and TECHNICIANS work the scene - lost in his thoughts, shaken. 
SWAT COMMANDER You all right? Nunally "wakes" - nods.   Absently: 
NUNALLY Yeah.     I'm good. To avoid talking more, he heads out to the glaring lights and chaos outside. 
FADE OUT 
INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING 
The alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news and traffic - - but the narrow futon bed is already empty. WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit by a solitary lamp. He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern Oklahoma State College. He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop screen: rental listings for a new apartment. 
TIME CUT The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on a length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters. Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves. The radio chatters.    Willy knots a tie in his crisp white collar.

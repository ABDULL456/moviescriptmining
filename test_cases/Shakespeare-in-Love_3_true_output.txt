WILL and VIOLA in bed.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. NIGHT. 
It's become late and the rehearsal is continuing by torchlight. 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee" 
We see that a group of the other actors have drifted "out front," drawn by the scene. FENNYMAN is there entranced. Clearly, this stuff is a cut above the normal. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
WILL, undressed, strides around the room, feeding "JULIET'S" lines to VIOLA in bed. 
WILL "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here. If they do see thee, they will murder thee." 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. NIGHT. 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye, Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity."

VIOLA AS ROMEO I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
WILL and VIOLA are both out of bed, halfway though dressing. Still rehearsing. 
WILL "Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?" 
VIOLA That's my line! 
WILL Oh, but it is mine too! 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. NIGHT.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
WILL and VIOLA are back on the bed, kissing and making love. 
WILL "My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep: 
VIOLA AND WILL (continuing the speech with him) the more I give to thee The more I have, for both are infinite." 
Outside the NURSE is knocking on the door and calling.

VIOLA slaps him playfully for his vulgarity, and then kisses him.

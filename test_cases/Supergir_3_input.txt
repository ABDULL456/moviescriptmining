Supergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right. 
INT. CONSERVATORY 
Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning. 
SUPERGIRL Ethan! 
She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared. 
The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall. 
Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him. 
SELENA Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever. 
Supergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field. 
INT. PHANTOM ZONE DOOR 
Supergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison. 
SUPERGIRL Ethan! Don't let her do this! 
Beyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl. 
SUPERGIRL No. No. It isn't true. 
The image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness. 
EXT. SPACE 
The flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears. 
EXT. PHANTOM ZONE 
Another kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY. 
She hops a few more times, with no more success. 
She picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected. 
Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away. 
ALURA'S VOICE Kara, where are you? 
KARA Mother? I can hardly hear you. 
ALURA. S VOICE Kara! You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared from the scanners... 
KARA I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. And I'm weak. 
ALURA'S VOICE Kara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the Power Source. The City is dying. 
KARA Then send someone else. I failed. 
ALURA'S VOICE We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no longer have the power to push through. 
KARA But Mother, I'm lost. 
ALURA' S VOICE You must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . . 
The rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost. 
KARA Mother---I tried. I really tried. 
Kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK. DAY 
Establishing shot. 
INT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone.

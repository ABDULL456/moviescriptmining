Kale quickly grabs the jar of sugar from the counter and even thinks to grab a spoon from the drawer. He delivers it to Giles as Julie brings the coffee, sits at the table. 
GILES (CONT'D) Thanks, man. 
Kale turns to leave again. 
GILES (CONT'D) Oh, hey, Kale... (as Kale turns back) Nice to finally meet you. 
Off Kale -- 
ASHLEY (V.O.) (prelap) Oooh. That's creepy. 
66   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER                                    66 
Ashley sits on the bed. She looks damned good, too.        Dolled up, lipstick. She's just heard the story from Kale. 
KALE I know, he's a total freak, right? 
ASHLEY And very vague... did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a "sinister message?" 
KALE Are you messing with me? 
ASHLEY Maybe a little. Did you even notice my hair? 
KALE So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car -- 
ASHLEY With the non dent dent -- 
KALE The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest -- And now he's showing up in my kitchen -- 
ASHLEY Why, because he slashed your mom's tire?

KALE Maybe. 
Ashley rolls her eyes. 
KALE (CONT'D) (pointing out window) Her car hasn't moved. 
ASHLEY It's called "the day after," Kale. Nobody moves after a night like that. 
KALE Well what if she's really "not moving?" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death -- 
ASHLEY (getting up) Then come up with a rescue plan and get back to me. 
KALE You're leaving? 
ASHLEY Have to.    Party. 
KALE Whose? 
ASHLEY Uh, mine? 
KALE How is that possible? 
ASHLEY Excuse me? 
KALE Well, I mean... Sorry, I just didn't think you knew anybody -- 
ASHLEY I don't, I didn't -- (off Kale's confusion) I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco? 
KALE Oh my god, "Skinny Psycho?!" I sat next to that bitch in Spanish --

ASHLEY (skipping that one) I told her my parents were outta town -- 
KALE And now the whole neighborhood's coming. 
ASHLEY Look, I'm stuck here. So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or... try to make the most of it. 
KALE Hey, I get it. You don't have to explain. 
ASHLEY Kale, you're welcome to come, but -- 
Kale looks at Ashley, realizes what she's referring to as he glances down to the ankle bracelet. 
KALE (with attitude) Well, I appreciate the thought. Really. 
ASHLEY (returning the tude) Glad to hear it. 
Ashley turns to leave. 
KALE It's funny, though.

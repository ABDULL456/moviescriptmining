TIME AND METALMOUTH Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight- Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight- 
We FOLLOW as Maceo hustles back and forth, trying to keep up with orders for ribs, bring cold beers out from the icebox, etc. He suddenly stops in his tracks- 
Nadine stands before him, looking fatally sexy in a SATIN DRESS she no doubt made herself. 
MACEO Oh my soul. 
NADINE Don't tire yourself out, Poppa. You an me got bidness together. 
MACEO I believe we do. 
He hurries past with his arms full of beer, pivoting to check her out from another angle- 
Dex sees across the room, frowns- 
Ham is talking to Lucille at the bar, leaning in close to be heard over the music- 
SONNY I heard the news- There's good rockin tonight! 
Sonny finishes with a squawking chord and the joint goes wild- CHEERING, WHISTLING, STOMPING! 
SONNY Alla you men grab hold of a woman! You can't find a woman, just grab hold of yourselves- we gonna play this one slow and tight. 
Sonny goes into the intro for Louis Jordan's Blue Light Boogie. Time lays down a steady rock beat with his sax and Ty joins in at the piano- 
SONNY They   did   the boogie real   slow With   the   blue lights way   down low They   did   the boogie real   slow With   the   blue lights way   down low 
Ty joins him- 
SONNY AND TY They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low 
Ty takes the verse- 
TY I went to a party With a bobby sox I started swingin All she would do was rock 
As they join in the chorus, Ty sees- 
Cool Breeze, strolling in, checking out the action with a proprietary air. 
Ty looks to Maceo, getting back behind the bar.     Maceo sees as well, tightening up- 
Cool Breeze nods to Ty. 
A slow, sexy SAX BREAK comes up and Ty leaves the piano to cross to the bar. When he gets there Maceo is already counting out a huge pile of BILLS- 
MACEO Hundred forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, five, six, seven, eight, nine- hundred fifty. And they's another fifty in here- 
Maceo thunks a heavy CLOTH SACK full of change onto the countertop- 
MACEO Lucky Hardaway don't mind some change, does he? 
Cool Breeze doesn't even glance at the money, hard-eying Ty instead- 
COOL BREEZE What if Mr. Hardaway was to say let the chumps keep their change, he wants the club back one way or the other? 
Maceo looks to Ty, who remains impassive, mind working- 
COOL BREEZE How'd that be? 
TY Well- he'd have to take it up with my bidness partner. 
Ty shifts and we RACK FOCUS to see across the room to Sheriff Pugh, receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from Delilah. Ty smiles and waves- 
Cool Breeze reconsiders his terms- 
COOL BREEZE That sheriff your partner? 
TY (sighs) Yeah, and he's twice as mean as he is ugly. 
Cool Breeze grins, scoops up the bills on the counter- 
COOL BREEZE You must want this club awful bad, brother. 
Cool Breeze hefts the sack of change, shoots a look to the stage and leans over to speak into Ty's ear- 
COOL BREEZE You maybe know this already, but that aint no Guitar Sam.

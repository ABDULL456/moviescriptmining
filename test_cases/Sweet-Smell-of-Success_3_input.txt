STEVE (watchfully, to Sidney) I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Favoring Sidney.  He pauses. 
SIDNEY Why me...? 
STEVE Why not you? 
SIDNEY That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?" 
STEVE Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both. 
SIDNEY (explosively) Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor? 
STEVE (quickly) It is a favor, isn't it? 
SIDNEY (as quickly) According to you, yeah. (continuing rapidly and with heat) Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend! 
RESUME REVERSE ANGLE 
Sidney's manner is a little too vigorous. (In adopting an aggressive tone, he is really trying to needle Steve.) Steve, though on the verge of losing his temper, is sharp enough to notice the point: 
STEVE You're talking very fast. 
SIDNEY (expostulating) Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya? (wheeling to Sally) How do you like it?  He comes to my office and - 
D'ANGELO 
Sensing the danger, D'Angelo moves forward soothingly between them. 
D'ANGELO Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and - 
STEVE (sharply) Don't apologize for me, Frank! 
D'ANGELO ...excited with good reason, I wanted to say. (to Sidney) Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet... 
SIDNEY (lightly) Should I cry...? 
Steve, with a glare at both men, goes to the phone on Sally's desk.  He dials. 
D'ANGELO (continuing) ...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet. 
SIDNEY Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth! 
In background Steve speaks quietly into the phone: 
STEVE I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please. 
D'ANGELO (replying to Sidney's question) We're on our way there now... 
SIDNEY (who has wheeled on Steve) What are you calling her for...? 
STEVE 
Sidney's reaction to the mention of Susan's name gives Steve food for thought.  While he waits for Susan to be summoned to the phone, he studies Sidney. 
STEVE (to Sidney) I'm the boyfriend, remember?  I hope one day she'll be my wife... (into the phone, gently) This is Steve, Susie.  Don't be alarmed, Susie, but I want you to look at Elwell's column in The Record...today...No, about me... 
INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - SUSAN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Susan is on the phone.  Listening to what Steve says, she is frightened - almost too frightened; it is as if, in some curious sense, she had been expecting this blow.  It brings an echo of an earlier tragedy. 
SUSAN A smear?...What...What kind of smear...?  Where are you? 
INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT 
Steve is on the phone in foreground, the others watching him. In particular, Sally, who stands near Steve, is studying him with obvious sympathy.  She looks slowly towards Sidney. 
STEVE (to the phone) We're on our way to the Elysian Room to dicker with Van Cleve - he's fired us already.  I'll call you later, dear... 'Bye!... 
He hangs up quietly, looks at Sidney and walks towards the door. 
STEVE Come on, Frank. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
As the door closes behind Steve, Frank follows, more slowly. As D'Angelo reaches the door, he pauses with his hand on the doorknob and turns back to study Sidney. 
SIDNEY 
He feels uneasy under D'Angelo's scrutiny.  Sally, in background, is also watching Sidney. 
SIDNEY (to D'Angelo) What are you looking at...? 
D'ANGELO 
He does not answer for a moment.  The unspoken accusation in his look is very clear.  Then: 
D'ANGELO (quietly) The ugly world, Sidney... (a pause) If I told Steve what I really think, he'd tear your head off... 
RESUME SIDNEY 
He brazens it out. 
SIDNEY (sneering) Tell him. 
RESUME D'ANGELO 
D'Angelo shakes his head. 
D'ANGELO No.  I'm interested in his future. 
D'Angelo goes slowly out. 
RESUME SIDNEY 
He hesitates before turning towards Sally (because he realizes that this exchange with D'Angelo must have confirmed Sally in her suspicions). 
SALLY 
Her face shows that Sidney is right.  Sally is deeply hurt, disillusioned. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Sidney turns to her, challenging. 
SIDNEY What's the matter?

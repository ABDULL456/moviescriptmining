97    NOAH'S POV                                                  97 The plates on Burnett's Volvo. 
98    INT. VOLVO - IN MOTION                                      98 One DOG starts to BARK. BURNETT Fine time to bark. Where were you when they were comin' up the walk? (beat) Shit. Bet they got a look at my license plates. If you saw him again, would you remember the guy who shot Max? 
JULIE All I remember is one of them had really bad hair. Where are we going? BURNETT I told you, I'm putting you into protective custody... JULIE (cuts him off) No way. Listen, no offense, but I don't trust anybody. BURNETT Yeah.   I noticed. (CONTINUED) 
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/23/94 PM                        40A. 98   CONTINUED:   (A1)                                      98 JULIE Believe me, it's not a new thing. Especially when my life is at stake. I read the newspaper you know, people disappear all the time. BURNETT (exasperated again) Fine. So what do you want to do? Where will you feel safe? JULIE I didn't really think about it. I guess it's your place or a plane ticket. Your place is cheaper. So you choose. BURNETT My place? Okay, good.   No, wait. My place is wrong. (CONTINUED) 
98    CONTINUED:                                                  98 JULIE Wrong? BURNETT I mean right. As in good. My place is good. We'll go there first. (confirms) My place. 
99    EXT. LOWREY'S BUILDING - NIGHT                              99 Burnett's Volvo pulls into the circular driveway of Oceanview Terrace. 
100   INT. VOLVO - CONTINUOUS ACTION                              100 BURNETT Wait here. 
101   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT                                          101 Burnett walks over to CHET, the doorman, a shifty little guy who's always got his hand out. He's sitting on a folding chair reading Penthouse Forum. CHET Detective Burnett... Mr. Lowrey is out... BURNETT He told me I could use the place tonight... 
CHET Didn't mention it to me. Chet holds out his hand. Burnett slips him ten. Chet sneaks a peek over at the car, sees Julie putting on lipstick. CHET Say.   How's that Mrs. Burnett? Burnett realizes this is going to cost him more. Gives him another ten. But for Chet it's still not enough. CHET Your children good? Mr. Lowrey says you got a regular baby factory goin' over there. (CONTINUED) 
101   CONTINUED:                                                   101 BURNETT (all his money) Here. And if that's not enough, I'm gonna run you in for extortion. CHET Now that I think about it, Mr. Lowrey did mention something about giving you the key. 
102   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                  102 The door opens, Burnett gropes awkwardly in the dark for the light switch. Finally finds it. 
BURNETT I forgot I had those switches moved. Welcome to Casa del Lowrey. Julie enters, looking left and right, cautious but impressed by the stylish digs. JULIE Nice... very nice. All this on a cop's salary? BURNETT I uh... I invest. JULIE Right. What was your last pick? A horse in the number two race at Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you an inside tip.

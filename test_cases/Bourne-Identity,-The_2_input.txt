A secret studio buried deep in the Langley facility. Equipment up the ass. Five people in this darkened room: AN ENGINEER working the board. CONKLIN looking sour. ZORN in the shadows. ABBOTT sitting there waiting for analysis from -- 
MRS. DOYLE. She's late sixties. A long-time spy shrink. An eminence. A diamond-hard, seen-it-all intelligence. 
BOURNE/TAPE "Kane. John Michael Kane." 
OPERATOR/TAPE "One moment, sir." 
MRS. DOYLE nods to THE ENGINEER. She's heard enough. 
MRS. DOYLE He's not lying. He's very highly stressed, but he's not lying. He's confused. He's aggressively searching for a way out of the chaos. This conversation, the video from the consulate -- the body language, vocal pattern -- it's my sense he's really lost here. (beat) I think he snapped. 
CONKLIN Is that a medical term? 
She turns. Battle lines drawn. 
MRS. DOYLE You want clinical terminology? It's called, "conversation hysteria." (to Abbott now --) I don't know exactly how you train these people. I'm not sure I want to know. I'll take a guess there's some extremely rigorous behavior modification going on here. 
Silence. The idea dangling for a moment. 
ABBOTT Let's assume that's true. 
MRS. DOYLE You can only wind people so tight. Even machines break down. 
CONKLIN This unit has an unblemished record of success. 
MRS. DOYLE Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting. 
EXT. BELLVILLE CAR PARK -- DUSK 
BOURNE and MARIE stashing the red car. 
INT. CIA HALLWAY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY 
ABBOTT and CONKLIN walk and talk. They want to get loud, but they can't. Too many people passing by -- 
CONKLIN That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes. He's loose. He's out of control. It's very clear what needs to happen. (point blank) I have work to do. 
ABBOTT What if he is working for someone else? What if he turned? 
CONKLIN Turn? To who? Where does he turn? What does he have to offer? He's got nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn? 
EXT. HOTEL DE LA PRIX -- NIGHT 
Funky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked kind of flop. Our establishing shot somehow includes THE PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG. 
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM -- NIGHT 
HAIR DYE washing down a rusted drain. It's MARIE alone in this crappy little bathroom. Jeans and bra. All of it soaking wet. 
A new hair color. 
A MIRROR. There she is. Her turn to stare at herself and wonder. 
And then she smells something. Smoke... 
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 
It's a shitty little room. BOURNE sitting on the bed. And the smoke is coming from... 
HIS PASSPORT -- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire. BOURNE holding it as it burns away. Bourne's face -- melting -- bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- BOURNE letting go just before it burns his fingers and -- 
BOURNE sits back. And there's MARIE standing there. And she's holding out her passport -- 
He looks at her. Big moment. 
BOURNE No. (he won't do it) You know who you are. You know what that's worth? That's everything. (pause) I can't live like this. I can't do anything until I know who I am. Believe me, you don't want what I have. 
He looks away. Silence. And then, she touches him. His shoulder. 
BOURNE almost recoils. Almost. He doesn't know what to do. Doesn't know how to react. 
MARIE in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you know the rest...

KASTLE (OS) (muffled) OK, hats on everybody. 
SOUNDS of the group gathering outside can be heard. 
SHEILA (OS) (muffled) Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it. 
KASTLE (OS) (muffled) Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three! 
The lid flies up and Kastle, Sheila, and Theo stand there, with party hats and party horns in their mouths. They all cheer and throw confetti. 
EVERYONE Surprise! 
Kastle takes a flash snapshot. Junior, lying on some folded blankets in the trunk, looks at his family with a stunned expression. He is in a straitjacket. Junior's new watch begins to PLAY "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head". He struggles to pull his arm out, but can't. Kastle reaches in to untie the straitjacket. 
KASTLE Steady boy, steady. 
Untied, Junior presses the BEEPING watch against his ear. His face breaks into a beatific smile. 
CUT TO: 
56     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, PICNIC TABLE - AFTERNOON		    56 
Kastle pulls shish kebab chunks off a skewer. He looks down to see that one of the chunks is a melted Ken head. He throws it away in disgust. 
KASTLE I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank. 
KASTLE See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior. 
SHEILA After we eat, Dad. 
KASTLE He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand. 
JUNIOR It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father. 
SHEILA Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in? 
KASTLE (whispers back, defensively) You're just like you mother! Always jealous! 
SHEILA That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything! 
KASTLE She ran away to be with that... (spits out his words) that Motocross champion. 
JUNIOR Your turn, Theo. Why can't you bowl? 
Sheila and Kastle sit up. 
THEO I don't like to talk about it. 
JUNIOR You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you? 
THEO It depends. 
JUNIOR It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.

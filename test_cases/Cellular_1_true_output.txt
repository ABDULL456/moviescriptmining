SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP! 
JESSICA Johnny--! 
RYAN I know, Jessica! The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately. Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop down a HILL to a strip mall below-- STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of the store's signs: "VERIZON WIRELESS". Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter- mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it there. 
SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP...'.' Ryan's got to do something.      Now. 
RYAN (CONT'D) You know that money you promised me? 
JESSICA (VO) Yes. 
RYAN I'm giving myself a raise. 
47   EXT. VERIZON MALL HILL - CONTINUOUS                             47 And with that, Ryan CRANKS the steering wheel hard right and HITS THE GAS!   Despite other drivers' protests, the little Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, TEARS through the rusty GUARD RAIL and -- VROOOOM! -- flies off the side of the hill! Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he SAILS through the clear blue sky. 
RYAN 
HOOOOLLYYY SHIIII-- THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car touches down on a steep downslope. Ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile, miraculously avoiding the minefield of ROCKS and TREE STUMPS. He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its antenna in his teeth. There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly hear is a CACOPHONY OF NOISE and Ryan HYPERVENTILATING. 
JESSICA (VO) What's going on?! 
RYAN (with phone in teeth) mmmrrmph mrm mrmph! Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two wheels. It looks like it's going to roll but gravity brings 
it back down -- SLAMM! -- so hard that the phone goes flying across the car! 
RYAN (CONT'D) Shit! Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD! 
RYAN (CONT'D) 
WHOAAAAAA! Ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the billboard's concrete posts, but -- WHAM! -- obliterates the rent-a-cop's BUBBLE LIGHTS on the billboard's lower edge. Somehow, Ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where it SKIDS OUT. 
RYAN (CONT'D) (grabbing phone) Jessica?! Can you hear me?! 
JESSICA (VO) I'm here! Ryan hops out and races inside-- 
48   THE VERIZON WIRELESS STORE - CONTINUOUS                         48 And of course, they're having a sale and the place is packed. Every SALESPERSON is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy. 
SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!! Panicking, Ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter -- 
IRATE CUSTOMERS Hey, what do you think you're doing? There's a line! -- to the OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN helping someone else. 
OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN ..and if you get the new Nokia 9200, you can switch out faceplates to match your mood! And we have a special today on tiger stripes... Are you feeling fierce? The salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand. 
EASILY-EXCITABLE CUSTOMER Oh, how fun! 
RYAN Excuse me-- 
OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN I'm sorry, sir, I'm with a customer now. 
(MORE) 
OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN (CONT'D) (indicates a number dispenser) But if you take a number, someone will be with you shortly. Ryan glances at the dispenser. A BIG YELLOW SMILEY FACE with tickets ejected from the mouth. The next ticket it offers is "#97"...and the Now-Serving Display on the wall reads "#71". 
SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!I Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN walks by.     Ryan grabs her. 
RYAN Hey! Hey!      I've got an emergency here -- 
BUSY SALESWOMAN Sorry, I'm on break-- 
RYAN Damn it, will you listen to me?! I've got a life and death call on this phone and my battery's dying! Do you have a charger? 
BUSY SALESMAN Sure. (walks away) Take a number and one of the sales associates will grab you one when your turn comes up. 
RYAN Bu t-- !

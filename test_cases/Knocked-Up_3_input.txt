JASON Oh, good. Tell her "What's up" for me. 
ALISON Okay. 
JASON All right, I'm gonna go make a protein shake. 
BEN And this, uh, beautiful young man is Jonah. 
ALISON Hi. 
JONAH Hey. 
BEN Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over there. 
ALISON Hi. 
BEN I'm gonna grab my shirt. Just take a seat if you want. Ben exits. Jonah is watching the lesbian sex scene in "Wild Things." 
JONAH Just another day at the office. Do you have any acting experience? 
ALISON No. 
MARTIN How's it goin'? You wanna toke? 
ALISON Eh, no. I'm good. 
JODI Hi. 
ALISON Hi. 
JODI I'm Jodi.

JODI Oh, aren't you scared? The way it's gonna come out of your...It's gonna hurt a lot I bet. Your vagina...That's so sick. 
ALISON I don't know. 
JODI Are you hungry? 
ALISON I'm okay right now. Thank you. 
JODI You must be angry at the baby whenever it steals your food, huh? "Oh it's mine, not yours." But, you know... Because you're family, you got to share. 
ALISON Right. Jay enters the room in a towel after a shower. 
JAY Man, my balls are shaved. My pubes are trimmed. I'm ready to fuckin' rock this shit. 
JONAH What the fuck, man?! If I go in there and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my mind! Last time I went to the bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed animal! 
JAY You're embarrassing me in company! 
JONAH You embarrass yourself! 
JAY Oh, great. I hope you have a great evening! Jay exits. Ben enters in his new shirt. 
BEN All right. Let's go. See you guys later.

Alison and Ben sit in a booth over appetizers. 
ALISON The funny thing is I really had never even thought about having a baby. 
BEN Yeah. 
ALISON If this hadn't happened, I don't think I would have wanted to have a baby for, like, I don't know, at least ten years. 
BEN At least! God, honestly, I just got used to the notion that someone would even have sex with me. I didn't think this would happen.

Ben puts on a baby hat and holds a baby outfit in front of him. 
BEN Get ready. This will be coming out of you in seven months. This is exactly what our baby will look like. 
ALISON It's a beautiful picture, Ben. 
BEN It is. It's not bad. (in a French accent) Hello, Mommy. Our baby's gonna be French Canadian. I like that. 
ALISON With a little hint of Spanish. 
BEN Exactly, I'm not good with accents.

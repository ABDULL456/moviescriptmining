The driver, confused, watches her hurry up the steps to the apartment building.  He drives off. 
INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - DAY 
Vivian walks toward her apartment.  The Landlord is sitting at the front desk in a dirty undershirt. 
LANDLORD Hey, we announce guests here. You a relative of somebody? 
Vivian lowers her sunglasses. 
LANDLORD (cont'd) Viv -- is that you? 
VIVIAN Yeah, it's me. 
She keeps walking. 
LANDLORD You lookin' good, Viv'.  Nice threads.  I gotta find time to shop. 
INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY 
Edward stands at the penthouse window, looking out.  He is dressed now, ready for travel.  There is something about his expression, his somber demeanor that suggests the way we saw him at the very top of the story.  A BELLMAN enters from the bedroom, rolling a luggage loaded dolly along in front of him. 
BELLMAN Is that everything, sir? 
EDWARD (turning from the window) That's everything. 
The Bellman exits, closing the door behind him.  The phone rings.  Edward crosses to it, picks it up.  The Maid comes in, looks around. 
MAID The lady, she go? 
EDWARD Yes.  She go. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
Edward with the Bellhop heads to the front door.  He's leaving. 
BELLHOP Do you have a car taking you to the airport, sir? 
EDWARD Yes. 
INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY 
Vivian, looking fresh scrubbed without make-up, is wearing clean jeans, a nice looking shirt and a suit jacket.  Her bureau's are open.  She is packing.  Kit is watching.  She takes the photo of her and Kit dressed up hot in hooker clothes and packs it. 
KIT So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco? 
VIVIAN Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be. 
KIT What kind of school? 
VIVIAN School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know. 
KIT So did I.  I made it with the principal. (recites) Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see. 
They both laugh but too hard. 
VIVIAN Want a pair of boots? 
KIT Do I!?  Momma! 
Taking them, she sits on the bed and puts them on. 
VIVIAN You sure you won't come with me? 
KIT And leave all this?  Not in a million. 
They laugh together.

VIVIAN Couple a hours. 
KIT Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy. 
VIVIAN Cool your jets a second. (going to her purse) Here's some money.

VIVIAN I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away. 
KIT I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day. 
They hug.

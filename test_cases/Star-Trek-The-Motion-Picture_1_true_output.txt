DIFALCO I plot them as reaching equidistant positions in... twenty-nine minutes, sir... mark! 
332   ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER AND "ILIA"                           332 
as Kirk vaults from his chair, strides to a handrail to confront the "Ilia"-probe. 
KIRK Why...?! 
"ILIA" The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet. 
KIRK Why?! 
"ILIA" The Creator has not answered. 
KIRK The carbon-units are not responsible for that. 
"ILIA" You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner. 
SPOCK (to Kirk) Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a machine too. 
DECKER (nods) It seems we all imagine God in our own image. 
333   ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER - INCLUDING CHEKOV (O)                333 Three of the four OMINOUS SWIRLING GREEN OBJECTS have all moved away from V'ger now, in different directions, growing smaller in the distance. The fourth object is holding position nearby, seeming to grow in size and intensity. 
334   ANGLE EMPHASIZING KIRK                                     334 
as he throws a look toward Spock who is now in deep meditation. Kirk turns and takes "Ilia's" shoulders and carefully turns her to face him. 
McCOY '... similar life forms...?' Jim, V'ger's saying the Creator is a machine...! 
DECKER (grimly amused) Of course: we all create God in our own image. 
Kirk peers at Decker a moment, ingesting this thought. Then he addresses "Ilia" again, this time with emotion: after all, he is pleading for the survival of the entire planet: 
KIRK V'ger! If we are lesser beings, we are still, like you, living. And because we are alive, we -- like you -- wish to survive. You must not destroy -- Kirk pauses abruptly: "Ilia" is regarding him blandly, stonily -- not the slightest reaction or response; clearly Kirk's plea is being ignored. Kirk draws in his breath to continue, realizes the futility, turns helplessly to Spock. 
335   ACROSS KIRK TO SPOCK                                       335 
who has been listening intently, with near fascination -- an idea forming in his mind. Quickly, he steps down to Kirk: 
SPOCK (quiet, terse) Captain... (reaches Kirk) Treat V'ger as you would... a child. 
336    FAVORING KIRK                                             336 startled at this, not sure he's heard correctly. 
KIRK Child...!? 
SPOCK Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing. 
DECKER (intrigued) Needing what...? 
McCOY Spock, this 'child' is about to eliminate all life on Earth; how do we teach it that that's 'wrong'? With a spanking...!? 
Spock peers at McCoy almost sadly, then replies to Decker. 
SPOCK It doesn't know what it needs, Comm          ander... (to Kirk) It does not know. 
Kirk says nothing, looks at Spock who is awaiting a reaction; then Kirk glances at "Ilia" -- his brain is racing, struggling to reach a decision. And then: 
KIRK (abruptly to "Ilia") The carbon--units-know-why-the Creator-has-not-responded. 
McCOY (shocked) Jim...! 
DECKER (to "Ilia," urgingly) Ilia... we can help V'ger find what it needs -- 
"Ilia" studies Decker just a bland beat, then turns to Kirk: 
"ILIA" (to Kirk, hard) Disclose the information. KIRK (cool, calm) Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet. 
"ILIA" KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION! 
Kirk studies her a moment, then decides to press his bet: 
KIRK (to "Ilia," almost pleasant) No. (then to crew commandingly) Secure all stations. Clear the bridge. 
A moment where all are startled at this order -- but no time for questions as just then the ship is ROCKED BY A FURIOUS POWERFUL ERUPTION NEARBY within V'ger. 
DECKER (amplified) Bridge to all decks,secure your stations. 
McCOY Your child is having a tantrum, Spock. SULU Clear the bridge, Captain...? 
KIRK That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge. 
Just then another ERUPTION -- the ship is ROCKED AGAIN. 
337   INT. INSIDE V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE                         337

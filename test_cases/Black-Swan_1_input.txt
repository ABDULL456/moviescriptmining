1 INT. DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1 
OPENING CREDITS: 
A SPOTLIGHT slices black space. 
In its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned. Beautiful and pure. 
The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as air and carefree. 
She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching. 
Scared, she peers into the darkness. 
She moves now, looking, growing more frantic. 
Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her. She stumbles backwards, frightened. 
She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART. 
He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell. 
She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her body, sensing something happening to her. Something terrifying. 
She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears beneath the beast's cape. 
She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN LAKE. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2 
In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream. 
The room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly. 
The door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it. 
Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed. Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She arches them, doing her first extensions of the day. 
3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3 
The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely. 
Nina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and legs in precise and rhythmic motions. 
The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum. Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained in a ballerina's bun. 
Nina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element. 
She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen. 
NINA (WHILE STRETCHING) I had the most amazing dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan. 
No answer. 
NINA (CONT'D) Different choreography, like the Bolshoi's. It was the prologue, when Rothbart casts his spell. 
Still no answer. 
Nina continues to stretch. 
4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4 
Nina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her. 
ERICA You're in a good mood. 
NINA I'm just excited to get back. 
ERICA Off-season always makes you grumpy. 
NINA (RE: GRAPEFRUIT) Look how pink. So pretty. 2A. 
ERICA NINA (inside joke) (inside joke) Pretty. Pretty. 
They giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct tape, ribbon, thread, etc. 
NINA (CONT'D) Plus he promised to feature me more. 
ERICA He certainly should. You're the most dedicated dancer in the company.

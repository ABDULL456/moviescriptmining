STACY You sure? 
AMY If you lift from his feet, he'll bend at the waist. 
STACY But if I lift at his hips, won't he arch his back? They both stare down at Mathis, imagining these two different scenarios. Amy glances toward the lamp, its dwindling oil. 
AMY His knees. Stacy crouches by Mathias's knees, a little off balance, favoring her wounded leg. Amy bends, sliding her hands under his shoulders. Mathias GROANS, and Stacy starts to pull away, but Amy shakes her head. AMY (cont'd) Quickly. On three. They count together: 
STACY AND AMY One ... two.-,.three. They lift, and Mathias immediately starts to SCREAM. His body sags at the waist; he begins to thrash his arms. Stacy starts to set him down, but Amy shakes her head, SHOUTS: 
AMY No! 
Stacy's wounded leg is hindering her; she can't keep up with Amy. Mathias's shoulders are level with the backboard, but his knees are still a good foot beneath it. He keeps SCREAMING. The bend at his waist increases. AMY (cont'd) Lift I Stacy tries to hoist him higher, lunging, his torso twisting, his SCREAMS going LOUDER. His right arm, hits the backboard, sends it swinging. The girls toss him toward it. 
EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT 
The sun has set. There's a half moon, giving us just enough light to dimly see Eric and Jeff peering into the shaft. Mathias's SCREAMS echo up toward them. 
THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT - NIGHT Mathias has fallen silent. He lies on the backboard, eyes clenched, sweat beading his forehead. Stacy is trying not to cry. She watches Amy buckle the two belts together, then drape them over Mathias's chest, knot them tight. Amy strips off her own belt, gestures for Stacy to do the same. She buckles these together, too. 
STACY I have to pee. She limps toward the wall, lowers her pants, gingerly crouches. She stares toward the other shaft as she pees: its stone archway, the shifting shadows, the vine rustling softly in the steady draught. Amy binds Mathias at his thighs. She WHISPERS to him: 
AMY You okay? She waits, but he doesn't respond. His eyes remain shut. Stacy rises, buttoning her pants, limps back toward Amy. She's on the edge of tears, is working hard to fight them off. Amy lifts her head, SHOUTS up to Jeff: AMY (cont'd) Pull him up! 
A moment's pause, then the windlass begins to CREAK once more. The backboard slowly rises, swaying gently. They watch it climb away from them. Amy holds out her-hand. ANY (cont'd) Here. Stacy just stares at her, not understanding. Amy nods at the lamp: the oil is gone. AMY (cont'd) It's gonna go out. And it's true: as Stacy reaches for Amy's hand, the light suddenly flickers, dims, drops them into darkness. 
EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - NIGHT 
The Mayans are settling into sleep at their campsite. Three of the men remain on guard duty in the clearing, facing the hillside, their backs to the fire. The young Mayan's corpse still lies in the dirt, fifteen feet in front of them. The firelight throws shadows across his bloodied body. 
EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT' 
The windlass CREAKS loudly as Eric and Jeff work to wind in the rope. Stacy has already been pulled up from the hole. She's sitting beside Mathias, who's lying on the backboard, on the edge of the clearing, by the orange tent. Amy emerges from the shaft, dangling beneath the sawhorse. Jeff holds the rope taut while Eric steps to the hole, pulls Amy toward him. Stacy watches from beside the backboard. Mathias's eyes are shut, his breathing ROUGH with phlegm. No one speaks. Once Amy is free of the sling, they all move to the backboard. Eric takes Stacy's-hand; Jeff crouches, starts to undo the belts. 
ERIC Shouldn't we carry him into the tent first? Jeff pulls free the first belt, shifts to the second one. 
JEFF We can't. 
ERIC Because? 
JEFF He's gonna keep leaking urine. 
AMY But we can't just leave him out in the open. 
JEFF We'll rig a shelter. With what's left of the blue tent. Jeff pulls the second belt free. Mathias's eyes remain shut. JEFF (cont'd) One of us should stay on watch while the others sleep. Two hour shifts. He reaches for his knapsack, unzips it. He pulls out a liter bottle of water. JEFF (cont'd) .Once it's light, we'll figure out how much water we have, and how to ration it. Food, too. For now, I think we should each just take a single swig. He uncaps the bottle, hands it to Amy. He watches her drink from it. When she's done, she passes it to Stacy. JEFF (cont'd) Eric and I'll build the shelter,. then I'll take the first shift. You two should try to sleep. Stacy takes her single sip, passes the bottle to Eric. 
INT. ORANGE TENT - NIGHT 
Stacy and Amy have pushed the camping supplies into a pile along the tent's rear wall. Stacy pulls off her pants, bends to examine her wound in the darkness. Amy is beside her, lying on her side. A beat of silence. Then, WHISPERING: 
STACY Amy? what? 
STACY We shouldn't have lifted him, should we? Amy reaches, pats Stacy's hand. 
AMY Shh.

FADE IN 
EXT. AN IMPOSSIBLE EXPANSE OF MARYLAND FARMLAND - DAY 
The wind rustles the endless field of corn, blows over the freshly mown meadow of soybeans, and magically sways a copse of trees. 
It's a Fall after-noon. A SUDDEN POUNDING OF GALLOPING HOOVES breaks the peace and... A HORSE and RIDER burst between the rows of corn into the meadow.  They are running for their lives. 
CLOSE ON: 
The rider is a bride -- a beautiful woman dressed in a disheveled wedding gown, it's train tattered and flying like a knight's banner out behind her. This is MAGGIE CARPENTER. 
The horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns to look behind her in terror.  The horse's labored breathing mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps. 
We see a WEDDING BOUQUET fly into a ditch as the horse thunders on.  Maggie clings to the reins.  She looks as though she is running from the devil himself.

EXT. IKE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT 
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY 
IKE (V.O.) Hey, Fisher, pick up.  I have some column ideas I want to bounce off you. Not there?  Okay.  Listen I'm thinking of writing about those mind-numbing informercials that are always on. 
Ike walks out of his apartment building talking on cell phone. 
IKE (cont'd) What do you think?  Good idea, right? Boring, down to death, pointless -- It sucks. 
Ike yells at a CONSTRUCTION WORKER. 
IKE (cont'd) If you guys are here any longer, they're gonna make you sign a lease. 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER Your column should be so funny. 
Ike turns and walks down the street, talking into cell phone. 
IKE Okay, I was also thinking I might write about... 
He spots a RICH LADY with tons of diamonds getting out of a Limousine, talking to a CHAUFFEUR.  He goes up to her. 
IKE (cont'd) Excuse me.  I was thinking of doing an article on limousines.  What would you say to people who never had a chance to drive in a limo? 
They walk up to her DOORMAN. 
LADY I'm sorry, I don't know any people like that. 
Ike walks off.  They stare at him as he goes. 
EXT. ANOTHER NEW YORK STREET - DAY 
Ike's talking on the phone to his friend's machine again. 
IKE (into phone) Fisher?  Come on -- I know you're sitting there laughing at me.  Pick up. I want to run an idea past you. 
Ike continues walking now in the full panic of writer's block. He pleads into his friend's answering machine as he walks. 
IKE (cont'd) (into phone) I just could use someone to toss it back and forth with for a few minutes, get the juice flowing, help me.  I have an hour and twenty-seven minutes and fifty-two seconds.  Hello? 
He walks away from the t-shirt table towards the bar.  The Vendor calls out to him. 
T-SHIRT VENDOR Hey, Ike, when are you going to put me in an article? 
IKE When your t-shirts stop shrinking. 
Ike enters the bar.  The Woman drops the shirt she was holding and walks off with her children.  The T-shirt Vendor goes back to selling his shirts. 
INT. NEW YORK BAR - LATE DAY 
Ike sits at the bar speaking to an attractive Woman nearby, a MAN puts is USA Today on the bar and addresses the BARTENDER. 
MAN I see photos of a lot of dead writers on these walls.  Got any living ones? I have a story to tell that could win one of them a Pulitzer. (then, with enthusiasm) Picture this, if you will.  A small town in Maryland, a sleepy little village, within that a hardware store... 
The Man continues speaking as Ike and the woman continue their conversation. 
WOMAN So what's in store for us in tomorrow's column? 
IKE I don't know yet.  I'm kind of a last- minute man.  Ideas don't flow until an hour or two before deadline.

INT. FRONT HALL 
Tracy goes up to the closet with her coat. The door is closed. She opens it. She hangs up her coat and closes the door again. Then she turns and starts walking out of the hallway to the living room. 
As she is rounding the corner into the living room, she walks right into Duncan. She barely has time to gasp before he clamps his hand over her mouth and pushes her against the wall. 
DUNCAN (urgent whisper) I just have to talk to you. (pathetically) I want you to be my friend. 
As she isn't struggling, he starts to loosen up on her. 
DUNCAN Please... 
He takes his hand away from her mouth, lets go of her, and slowly, cautiously steps back. Tracy looks at him for a breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear. Then she screams. 
Duncan jumps back, stunned, frightened and confused. Tracy doesn't move. She just keeps screaming hysterically. 
EXT. STREET 
Tracy's screams carry out into the night as Clifford races across the street and into the apartment building. 
INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT 
Duncan runs to a window, throws it open and climbs out onto the fire escape. 
INTERCUT - APARTMENT STAIRS AND FIRE ESCAPE 
As Clifford bounds up the stairs, flight after flight, and Duncan tears down the fire escape. 
INT. SIXTH FLOOR 
The screaming has stopped when Clifford reaches Tracy's door. He grabs the doorknob and heaves himself against the door. It's bolted shut. 
Clifford pulls one of the needles from his jacket and hammers it into the lock. The bolt springs and Clifford runs into the apartment. 
INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT 
As Clifford bursts in. Tracy gestures toward the window. Clifford runs to it and sticks his head out. 
POV - CLIFFORD 
Duncan is gone. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Clifford runs to a window on another wall and looks out onto the street. 
POV - CLIFFORD 
No sign of the Englishman. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Clifford runs out of the apartment, yanking his needle from the lock as he passes the door, and charges back down the stairs. 
Tracy moves to the door and closes it. She is breathing heavily. 
O.S. we hear the angry sizzle of coffee spilling onto the hot stove, as Tracy goes to get it. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING 
Clifford comes out, looks around and moves rapidly up the street. 
EXT. A STREET 
Duncan is hurrying along, dodging in and out of people, trying to move quickly but not draw attention to himself... 
EXT. ANOTHER STREET 
Clifford is travelling along the sidewalk, crossing the street, looking everywhere... 
EXT. ALLEYWAY 
Duncan is running up the alley. He comes to a stop beside some piled up trash cans. He leans against the brick wall of the building, huffing and puffing. He is frightened, but he feels safe for now. He slowly slides down the wall to the ground...

The dead dog slides against the fencing as Trupo overturns the kennel to reveal Frank's stash of cash. 
298   INT. AIRPORT HANGER OFFICE - MINUTES LATER - DAY             298 
Richie and Toback sit before the Federal Attorneys and customs agents. The US Attorney hangs up a phone ... then: 
US ATTORNEY That was a military transport plane. If there was heroin on board then someone in the military would have to be involved. Which means that even as it fights a war that's claimed 50,000 Americans lives, the military is smuggling narcotics. 
Richie's in serious trouble and knows it.    As does Toback. 
US ATTORNEY That's how these events are being interpreted by General Easton in that call to me. That someone employed by the this office believes the United States Army is in the drug trafficking business - and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men who've given their lives in the defence of democracy. 
RICHIE There are drugs on that plane - 
US ATTORNEY Shut the fuck up. 
Richie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate organization of his world, his superiors. 
US ATTORNEY Is it any wonder then, because of your actions, the entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastic- ally as that fucking transport plane? That's what you've accomplished Mr. Roberts. Single-handedly. 
RICHIE I had good information the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane. 
US ATTORNEY And that target is? 
(CONT) 
298   CONTINUED:                                                     298 
RICHIE Frank Lucas. 
No one in the room, except Richie and Toback, has ever heard the name. The federal men regard one another blankly. 
US ATTORNEY Who?  Who's Frank Lucas? (no one seems to know) Who's he work for? Which family? 
RICHIE He's not Italian. He's black. 
Now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before - 
US ATTORNEY Is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement, you're making jokes? 
RICHIE I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia in the dope business. I believe he buys direct from the source in Southeast Asia, cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US military planes and personnel to bring pure No. 4 heroin into United States. 
Richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make sense out of his ridiculous theory. Toback tries to come to his defense - TOBACK Richie has a lot of experience - 
US ATTORNEY Does he. And how many arrests has he made in his so-called investigation? 
RICHIE I was promised when I took this job, it was about real arrests. 
US ATTORNEY Does that mean `none?' 
RICHIE I have cases against most of Frank's organization. Not him - 
(CONT) 
298        CONTINUED:                                                       298 
US ATTORNEY (more to the others) Frank's organization - 
RICHIE That's right. 
US ATTORNEY No fucking nigger has accomplished what the American Mafia hasn't in a hundred years! 
RICHIE Yeah, you'd know, sitting here, having never been on the (street) - 
US ATTORNEY Lou, get this fucking kike out of here - 
Richie goes for him and lands several punches before Toback and the others can pull him off. 
299 OMIT                                                              299 OMIT 
300        INT/EXT. AIRPORT HANGAR OFFICE - DAY                             300 
Richie and Toback walk briskly across the lobby - 
TOBACK He was out of line, Richie. 
Richie isn't really listening. Strides past his detectives on his way out of the building. To Spearman - TOBACK It's over.   You're shut down. 
Toback watches as the detectives follow after Richie striding toward his car. 
301 - 302 OMIT                                                 301 - 302 OMIT

Ana stares at the floor. It all just seems to get worse and worse. They had their chance to get out and missed it.

49   INT. STORE - DAY                                               49 Butch dumps a six pack of RC Colas, a handful of Moon Pies, a handful of beef jerky and some gum on the counter. 50   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                        50 Jerry's chin is on the front seat now and his arms are draped over it. JERRY Those are cute little underwears you got there, boy. Say does your mama sew yer' name in 'em, initials or anything? Jerry's hand slowly reaches down to the white briefs. He places one finger in the front elastic waistband and slowly pulls it open. JERRY Whatcha' got in there? Jerry sneaks a peek. JERRY Kinda' puny, ain't it? Phillip, diverted, looks down.    In a flash Jerry grabs the gun. JERRY The hand is quicker than the eye. Jerry flicks open the revolver, spins it -- empty slots. JERRY (re: Butch) That sonofabitch. Hell's bells, no shells. 51   INT. STORE - DAY                                               51 The Old Man puts down his broom and ambles to the register. OLD MAN This be all for ya'? BUTCH This and a carton of Chesterfields. (beat) Are those .38 shells? Gimme a box. The Old Man puts the cigs and shells on the counter and starts to tally the bill on a notepad. (CONTINUED) 
51   CONTINUED:                                                         51 OLD MAN With deposit comes to four dollars eighty. Butch reaches in his pocket and extracts the wad stolen from the convenience store. The Old Man takes note. Butch selects a five and places it on the counter. OLD MAN Land's sake.   What line of work you in? The Old Man bags the goods, but Butch takes the shells and puts them in his coat pocket. BUTCH Used cars. Buy 'em, fix 'em up. Sold a Cadillac down in Madisonville this mornin'. OLD MAN Don't say. 52   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                            52 Jerry puts his gun hand around Phillip's neck and pulls the sobbing boy closer. Jerry rests his face on Phillip's neck. JERRY Come over a little closer. As Jerry    groans, Phillip seizes the moment and bites Jerry hard on    the ear. Jerry screams and drops the gun, which Phillip    picks up and carries with him as he scurries out of the car    and into the hay field. Jerry, in pain, now with both ears bleeding, crawls out of the back seat and gives chase. 
53   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                                   53 Phillip, still sobbing, runs for his life in the hay, which is a full foot taller than he. JERRY no longer stumbling, now grinning maniacally, gives chase, whistling as if calling for a lost puppy. JERRY I'm gonna' find you boy.    You best come here. PHILLIP gun in hand, stumbles, falls, gets up, keeps running. He falls again and crawls to a stop. He wipes his tears and balls up on the ground trying to make himself invisible. 
54   EXT. STORE - DAY                                              54 Butch exits with a grocery sack. When he sees the car doors open he dumps the groceries in the front seat and looks to the field. HIS POV The hay rustles as Jerry moves through the field. 55   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                              55 Jerry, crouching, moves through the field -- eyes peeled for any sign of Phillip. Phillip lies still. He hears the hay rustling near him and he looks up, squares his body and points the revolver at... 
Butch, who spots him, motions for him to stay put and holds out his hand for the gun. Phillip hands it over and watches while Butch reaches into the plaid jacket pocket, extracts a few shells and loads the .38. JERRY a little frustrated now, but still moving forward. JERRY (a whisper) Hey boy. Hey boy. You better hope I don't find ya'. He spots something -- a dash of color -- and begins to crawl faster. He parts a thick batch of hay and looks up into the gun barrel and eyes of ... BUTCH 
squatted down,   who levels the revolver and closes one eye. Jerry laughs. JERRY Whatcha' gonna' do? Hit me with it? Butch reaches into the coat pocket with his free hand and shows a shell or two. Jerry's grin drops. JERRY (pleading) Me'n you are friends!!!! BUTCH Thick as theives. PHILLIP hears a GUNSHOT and runs for his life back toward the store. 
56   EXT. PARKED IMPALA - DAY                                      56 Phillip runs to the car and hides behind the tire opposite the store and field. In the b.g. we see Butch emerge from the field and walk toward the car. The Old Man, who also heard the shot, emerges from the store with a baseball bat.   Butch arrives at the car, spots the Old Man and levels the revolver at him. Phillip is relieved when he hears Butch's voice instead of Jerry's. BUTCH (to Old Man) You got a phone? OLD MAN Naw.

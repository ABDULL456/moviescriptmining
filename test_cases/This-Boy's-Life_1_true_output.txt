CAROLINE (big smile) Then you won't feel too bad about carrying it home, will you? Several people laugh, and the Man, bested, turns away. Everyone turns quiet to watch the Man shoot. He is evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he SHOOTS and waits, the score is raised: 95. There is an immediate stir -- Caroline can win if she shoots a virtually perfect round. Dwight's name is called. He takes his position, but clowns around, SHOOTING first left-handed, then right- handed, then with both eyes closed. His score is raised: 24. There is scattered laughter, and Dwight leads it -- hell, it's all a joke to him, his attitude says. Caroline takes her stance. Rock-steady, she SHOOTS her TEN SHOTS and waits. And then it comes: 98. She's won. The second-place Man wheels away angrily, but everyone else congratulates the laughing Caroline, as an official presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a pedestal, and a huge ham. In the midst of the hubbub, Toby manages to get close enough to congratulate his mother. Caroline glances toward Dwight as she whispers to Toby: CAROLINE That was for you, honey. TOBY (impressed) I didn't know you were a member of the N.R.A. (CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              38 CAROLINE I'm a little behind in my dues -- Thirty-six years behind. 
39   INT. DWIGHT'S KITCHEN - DAY                                   39 Caroline, Toby and Pearl enter. Norma is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Dwight WALKS HEAVILY down the hall to his bedroom and SLAMS the DOOR. NORMA What gives? TOBY Mom won the turkey shoot. NORMA Oh, boy. Now we're in for it -- he thinks he's some kind of big hunter. PEARL Well, he killed a deer once. NORMA That was with the car. They all laugh. 
40   INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON                                  40 Though there are some occasional sentences like    "Could I have the potatoes, please?" or "This dressing is    really delicious," mostly there is just silence and the    noise of SILVERWARE ON PLATES. Dwight is working hard     on the wine. DWIGHT I got just one thing to say. (as everyone stiffens) I'm sitting at the table with the best damn shot in the county! Everybody relaxes, and general conversation begins. 
41   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                             41 Norma plays "Blue Monday" on an upright piano whilst Toby sings it. After finishing the song, Norma launches into "On Moonlight Bay." Everybody joins in. (CONTINUED) 
41    CONTINUED:                                          41 Toby and Caroline glance at each other and smile. 
41A   SAME SCENE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT                              41A Caroline, who is sleeping on the sofa bed, returns from the bathroom. She sees that Toby's awake on his pallet on the floor. She sits on the floor beside him. (The whole conversation is conducted in whispers.) CAROLINE So what do you think? TOBY They're okay. What's that bald spot on Pearl's head? Ugh. CAROLINE Some sort of infection. TOBY Norma's nice. CAROLINE They're all nice, but Dwight keeps rushing me, keeps talking about marriage. And I don't really want to get married -- not now anyway. TOBY That's fine with me. (a beat; new tone) I wish you would've stayed married to Dad. CAROLINE Oh, don't wish Duke back on me. God. TOBY That woman he married?    Is she really rich? CAROLINE Like King Midas. Okay, look, we'll go back to Seattle and see how things go. I've been thinking about taking a course in stenotyping. A court reporter's pay is real high. Kathy got engaged, so either I find us another roommate or I've got to make some more money. And this stenotyping thing sounds just right. This could turn out good, honey. 
42   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM AT SCHOOL - DAY                           42 Toby, Terry Silver and Terry Taylor lounge against the wall, smoking. TOBY I mean I blew it off, man -- I blew his fuckin' turkey's head off. Terry Silver takes a long slow drag on his cigarette. The other boys glance at each other: they don't buy it. TERRY TAYLOR With a .22. TOBY Fuckin' A.    Winchester .22.   Pump. TERRY TAYLOR Wolff, you are so full of shit. TOBY Don't believe me -- see if I care. TERRY TAYLOR All a .22 bullet would do is make a hole in his head. Toby takes a drag on his cigarette. TOBY One bullet, maybe. TERRY TAYLOR Oh. Oh, I see -- you hit the turkey more than once. While he was flying. In the head.

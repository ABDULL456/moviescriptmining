ELIZABETH Are you sure it can't hurt us? 
VICTOR Nothing can. Not ever. 
She seeks his hand. Fingers clasp. Comfort and strength. 
TILT UP to the skylight. Rain drumming the glass... 
INT - MANSION - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY 
Victor and Elizabeth are learning to waltz, their movements stiff and awkward, childlike. MRS. MORITZ is at the harpsichord. Justine sits with her dolly, watching. 
MRS. MORITZ You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong... 
VICTOR Mrs. Moritz. 
MRS. MORITZ ...aaand, one-two-three, one-two- three, twirl-two-three... 
JUSTINE Mama, can I dance with Victor? 
MRS. MORITZ Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a sweeping arc about the room! one- two-three, twirl-two-three. 
Victor and Elizabeth gamely work their way across the vast room, tripping on each other's toes. They pass within inches of CAMERA, bodies WIPING FRAME... 
INT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY (TEN YEARS LATER) 
...and they sweep from before our eyes, waltzing away from camera to reveal Victor now 17, intense and handsome as he approaches manhood. Elizabeth is a blossoming and graceful beauty at 16. Mrs. Moritz is still conducting the lessons. 
MRS. MORITZ ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three... Excellent! You'll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen! 
They're certainly the envy of Justine, who gazes at Victor as he sweeps Elizabeth around the room in his arms. She isn't concentrating and fumbles on the keyboard. Her mother throws her a look of reproval: 
MRS. MORITZ Justine. Surely you can maintain better time than that. 
JUSTINE Yes, Mama. 
Flustered, she puts her attention back on the keyboard as Victor and Elizabeth keep dancing, swirling fluidly about the room, their attention only on each other. 
INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
A skylight above us. A storm is raging, rain drumming the glass. We hear SCREAMING in the house. TILT DOWN to Victor perched at the edge of a settee, seething with tension. 
Waiting. Elizabeth is with him. She squeezes his arm, trying to reassure him. 
ELIZABETH She'll be all right. 
Another SCREAM rips down the hallway. Justine comes scurrying up the stairs, about to enter his parent's room with a fresh load of sheets. Victor lunges to his feet and intercepts, trying to push past her, but finds the doorway implacably blocked by Mrs. Moritz. 
MRS. MORITZ You can do nothing here. Wait downstairs. 
He can see his mother in the dim kerosene light, writhing and screaming on the bed, belly swollen and distended. His father, sleeves rolled up, works feverishly to save her. 
VICTOR Mother? 
FATHER Victor, do as you're told! 
Justine glances at Victor, longing to comfort him. She squeezes past into the room. The door slams in his face. He turns to Elizabeth, eyes brimming with terror... 
INT - PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT 
...as his mother falls back on the sweat-soaked sheets, blowing air like a bellows, trying to give birth... 
EXT - MANSION - NIGHT 
...while her SCREAMS mingle with the howling of the wind, the stump of the long-dead oak tree pokes from the earth in the foreground like a gravestone, lashed by the rain. 
INT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT 
VICTOR stares out the window at the raging storm. Elizabeth appears at his side. He doesn't look at her. 
VICTOR As a boy, I stood at this window and watched God destroy our tree. 
b.g. screaming stops, Victor and Elizabeth turn, gazing up the grand staircase. The sudden silence is even more frightening. The FAINT CRY of a newborn infant drifts down A door opens upstairs, throwing a spill of light. Victor's father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward them. He pauses halfway down, unable to continue. 
VICTOR Father? 
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the room, revealing Victor's father on the staircase. Face haggard. Eyes hollow. Clothes spattered with blood. Hands glistening wetly red. 
ELIZABETH Oh God. The blood. 
Father sits down shakily on a step. Victor and Elizabeth race up the stairs and pause before him. 
FATHER I did everything I could. 
Victor lets out a sob of anguish. Elizabeth begins to cry. 
Father gathers them into his arms.

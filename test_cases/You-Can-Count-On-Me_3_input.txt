Brian kisses her. She drops her folders and they make out against the door. 
OUTSIDE THE OFFICE: The employees click away at their PCs. Mabel exchanges a quiet word with Chuck. 
INSIDE THE OFFICE: Brian has Sammy pressed against the wall with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their underwear out of the way. It's not so easy in their office clothes. Sammy tears away. 
SAMMY Brian, that's enough. 
BRIAN falls back, breathless. 
BRIAN OK. Sorry. 
He lunges at her again. They kiss some more. 
OUTSIDE THE OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER: Sammy comes out of the office, more or less composed, carrying her folders. She heads down the hall past the other employees, including Mabel, and surreptitiously readjusts her scrunched-up underwear. 
INT. DAWSON'S. DAY 
Sammy and Bob sit at lunch. Sammy is picking at her food. 
BOB You're awfully quiet. 
SAMMY I'm sorry. 
BOB Um... Have you thought at all about what I said? 
SAMMY Of course I've been thinking about it. 
BOB So... Any decisions? Or -- do you still want to think about it some more...? 
SAMMY Well -- I mean -- I don't know, Bob. I mean, we haven't exactly been going steady the last few months, if you know what I mean -- 
BOB Yeah, no, I know -- 
SAMMY -- and then we see each other twice and you suddenly say you want to get married? I mean... 
BOB No, you're right, you're right -- 
SAMMY What are you talking about? 
Pause. 
BOB I don't know... I... Maybe this is... Last year I sort of thought you were possibly interested in that... idea... but I was the one who, you know, wasn't "ready" at that point -- So that's why I thought things kind of slowed down with us... 
SAMMY Don't make me feel bad for you. 
BOB (Bristling) I don't want you to feel bad for me. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Sammy, Terry and Rudy are all watching TV. Sammy and Rudy are in pajamas. Nobody's happy and nobody's talking. 
The PHONE RINGS. Sammy goes to it and picks up, surprised because of the hour. 
SAMMY (Into phone) Hello? 
BRIAN (On phone) It's Brian. 
Sammy turns away and lowers her voice so Terry and Rudy won't overhear her. 
SAMMY Brian. Where are you? 
EXT. GAS STATION. SIMULTANEOUS 
Brian is on the pay phone outside a gas station. 
BRIAN I'm buying milk. I just thought I'd say hello. 
WE CUT BETWEEN THEM. Sammy doesn't say anything. 
BRIAN Look, I know it's probably too late, but is there any way you can come out for a little while? 
SAMMY Brian, I think you're going crazy.

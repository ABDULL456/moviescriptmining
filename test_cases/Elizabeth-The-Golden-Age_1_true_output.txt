We don't yet know what the felling of the trees portends. But Reston does. To him, it's a glorious sight. 
RESTON Your majesty has a merciful soul. 
May 1 Blue Draft - p.11 
PHILIP I sacrifice my country's forests to save the souls of a lost nation. That is true mercy. England is lost to darkness, Father. I bring light. 
WIDE NOW - We see the carriage and the royal party crest a hill, and there is revealed an awesome sight: the forest has been felled as far as the eye can see. Great piles of cut timber dot the ravaged landscape. Everywhere men are at work lopping branches from felled trees. Wagon teams haul immense trunks away. Fires burn stacks of lopped branches, and the smoke rises up into the empty sky. I N THE CARRIAGE - On Reston's face as he stares at the fires. He speaks half to himself, out of the depths of his own fanatical certainty. 
RESTON The light of purifying fire. 
He turns and fixes the king with his intent gaze. 
RESTON My time has come, majesty. (Beat) Send me home. 
EXT. CHARTLEY HALL- DAY 13C                                                                13C Establishing wide shot of chartley Hall. 
EXT. CHARTLEY HALL, GARDEN - DAY A small yapping Skye terrier is barking at a LAUNDRESS, who is handing over a letter, folded small, to a sharp-faced middle-aged French lady's maid, ANNETTE. The laundress curtseys and leaves. 
INT. MARY STUART'S QUARTERS, CHARTLEY HALL - DAY The terrier scampers ahead of Annette to its mistress, MARY STUART, who sits embroidering a pink satin petticoat. She is a handsome but bitter woman in her mid-thirties. Round her stands her small retinue of three ladies and a chaplain. 
MARY This is so pretty I'm inclined to send it as a present to my dear cousin Elizabeth. She holds up the delicate work to show her ladies. 
May 1 Blue Draft - p.12 
MARY (CONT'D) It is an intimate garment, of course. But even Elizabeth must have the occasional intimate moment. Annette reaches her mistress and kneels before her, holding out the letter. 
ANNETTE My Queen. 
Mary lays down her needlework and takes the letter from her and reads it for herself. 
MARY Our friends write to give us hope. 
ANNETTE (low) Soon England's true believers will rise up against the bastard usurper Elizabeth, and slit her throat, and throw her down to hell. 
MARY That's enough, Annette. (But she loves it.) Slit her throat? Please. 
ANNETTE And when the bastard usurper is dead, my lady will be queen. 
The chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning. 
The Warden of Chartley Hall, SIR AMYAS PAULET, enters the room. He is soberly dressed, but has charming manners, and is clearly susceptible to his handsome ward. Mary turns to him at once with a teasing smile. MARY Here's my noble jailer, come to smack my hand. She holds out one hand to be smacked. The other hand holds the letter out of sight. MARY Have I sinned again, sir? PAULET No, no, my lady. Unless beauty is counted a sin. 
DoubleGoldenrod - 25 July -p.13 PAULET(cont'd) (Kissing her hand) I come to pay my respects. MARY Oh, you jailer. I don't trust you. PAULET Not jailer, my lady, please. Warden. Protector. Friend. You are the Queen's guest. Mary signs to her ladies. One of them brings her the embroidery, discreetly receiving in exchange the hidden letter. 
MARY See how I pass my time in my lonely prison. PAULET Charming, ma'am. Distractingly charming. She holds the intimate garment against her body. Paulet seems to be too fascinated by it to notice he is being 
duped. 
MARY 
Such a pretty undergarment. But for whose eyes? 
DoubleGoldenrod - 25 July -p.14 
INT. ARMOURER'S SHOP, LONDON - DAY A pistol is being loaded: a fiddly process involving a powder horn, wadding, and an iron ball the size of a hazelnut. ARMOURER (O.O.V.) So what's it for, my young friend? Not for shooting rabbits, I'm guessing. SAVAGE We live in dangerous times. 
ARMOURER We do indeed. 
Savage moves close as if to study the loading process. We see the two of them talking from outside the window. 
SAVAGE (very low) The conspiracy gains strength. 
Tell our master one of the circle has already gained access to the court. The Armourer nods. He hands the pistol to Savage. Savage takes it and leaves. Immediately after, a man enters and walks up behind the now seated Armourer. The Armourer turns round. RESTON I ask for your forgiveness. Moving with speed, he seizes the Armourer's head, twists it to one side, and snaps his neck. Reston walks quietly out of the store. 
EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY A crowd of eager SPECTATORS and WOULD-BE COURTIERS has gathered, held back by a line of guards, all hoping to attract the attention of the Queen when she appears. This is the route from the Presence Chamber to the Chapel Royal. 
May 1 Blue Draft - p.15 Every Sunday the Queen processes here, and crowds gather to see her. Two of Walsingham's men, AGENTS 1 and 2, mingle in the crowd: faces we'll see again.

{"train": "M Y   B E S T   F R I E N D ' S   W E D D I N G \nby Ronald Bass First Draft Screenplay \nINT.  BOULEY RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - NIGHT \nDim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated, the congenitally impatient.  Everyone in this queue holds a reservation at least an hour overdue.  Tourists can't even make the line.  PAN ahead to... \n... the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant service.  Covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving by far the most lavish service of all.  Captains hover, presenting delicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose person they screen from our view.  We can see, however... \n... the honored guest's companion.  Ignored, bemused, across the table.  This is DIGGER DOWNES, 36, darkly attractive.  Kind eyes, an intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's most unobtrusive and conservative chalk-stripe suit.  He is gay, but you wouldn't guess it.  Loyal and wise and generous, and you might.  He watches with a quiet twinkle, as the Captains now step back, revealing to us... \n... their most unlikely icon.  JULIANNE POTTER, almost 28, wears her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled together in fifteen seconds.  She is unkempt, quick, volatile, scattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an original beauty.  Dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender expressive fingers, which point to... \nCAPTAIN A variation on our squid ink risotto.  Trace of Moselle, to sweeten the stock. \nShe doesn't like that idea at all.  Shoots him a sharp look of doubt that makes him smile.  Murmur... \nCAPTAIN Don't kill us on this one, it's a long shot. \nPlaces the moist lump of black rice before her.  She takes a surprisingly small amount, rolls it over her tongue.  Makes dead flat eye contact with Digger.  And nods, it's actually quite nice. The Captain breathes with relief.  She turns her dark eyes to him. The tone says they're pals... \nJULIANNE I'm writing it up as inventive and confident.  Which it is.  Off the record, I'll need an extra boat of the ink.  Or a salt shaker. \nCAPTAIN I'll toss a coin. \nAs the Captain splits, Digger looks around at the other tables, which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away. \nDIGGER Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public? \nJULIANNE If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note. \nShe glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn nearby. \nJULIANNE Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity? \nDIGGER I've adjusted, and thanks for asking. \nShe leans forward, as if sharing something conspiratorial. \nJULIANNE See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out. \nDIGGER Which is everyone you couldn't get in. \nJULIANNE Plus some guys whose food I don't like. \nPushes the risotte across to him.  He lifts a fork. \nDIGGER This fellow from Newsday ever call? \nShe shrugs.  Pulls a cellular out of a large, jumbled bag. \nJULIANNE I'll buzz my machine.  Inventive and confident, yeh? \nShe dials.  He tastes. \nDIGGER Needs salt. \nJULIANNE Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w... \nDIGGER ... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them. \nShe's punching in her code. \nJULIANNE Sometimes I do.  Like for two months. \nDIGGER ... weeks. \nOver the phone, we hear her answering machine... \nMAN'S VOICE (V.O., soft) Hey.  It's Michael. \nAnd her face changes.  Warms.  Just to hear the guileless voice. \nMICHAEL (V.O.) God, it must be, what, months, huh? I can't wait to talk to you.  I'm in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton... \nShe looks impressed and surprised.  Fancy place for this guy. \nMICHAEL (V.O.) Call me four in the morning, whatever, we gotta talk. \nAs she hangs up.  She still has that look in her eye.  Digger has never seen that, and he likes it very much. \nDIGGER Who called? The man of the moment? \nShe smiles.  A sweet, natural smile that makes us like her, too. The Bohemian sophisticate has vanished. \nJULIANNE No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk. \nDIGGER The wandering sportswriter. \nHe pushes the risotto back her way. \nDIGGER I didn't know you two had a past. \nHer gaze sharpens.  Hmmn? \nDIGGER The look in your eye. \nShe blushes.  Shakes her head, no way. \nJULIANNE Sophomore year at Yale we had this one hot month.  And, you know me, I got restless... \nHe knows her.  She got restless. \nJULIANNE So I get up the nerve to break his heart.  I tell him there's this dreamy exchange student from Pakistan who wants to, you know... \nDIGGER We're about to find out. \nInk is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down her face.  She absently dabs a napkin, keeping some of it from reaching her sweater. \nJULIANNE When I turn him down... \nShe realizes the full weight of the truth. \nJULIANNE We'll never be the same. \nDIGGER I have a suggestion... \nJULIANNE I'll have to kill myself before I call him. \nStaring in each other's eyes. \nDIGGER (sadly) That was it. \nINT. JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT \nJulianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush. Gray foam pours from her mouth, spattering the oversized basketball jersey she wears as a nightshirt.  In the mirror, her troubled eyes dwell on Michael, flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on the closed toilet lid. \nShe spits, sticks her tongue way out.  Incredibly black.  Great. Depressed, terrified, and disfigured for life.  She snatches up the hated phone, and wanders aimlessly into... \n... her bedroom.  West Village view.  Defiantly jumbled, aggres- sively eclectic.  Traces of wonderful taste mixed with I-like-it- you-got-a-problem-with-that? She stumbles around, rehearsing... \nJULIANNE This is awkward timing, Michael, I just joined this convent, and they never give your deposit ba... \nStops.  Full-length mirror.  She straightens her hair, to look her best. \nJULIANNE Michael, I'm married. \nNot enough. \nJULIANNE ... and I have two weeks to live. \nChanges tone... \nJULIANNE Michael, I'm trying to be gay, don't confuse me. \nShe turns to continue pacing, and walks straight INTO a dresser. Stuns her, momentarily.  Enough, already! She punches up the number, primping absently in the mirror.  When it connects... \nJULIANNE I was calling Michael O'Neal, but seeing it's so late, I could just leave a mes... \nNo such luck.  Cut off.  Waits.  And then... \nJULIANNE (soft) Good evening, sir.  You've been enrolled in the Obscene Call Of The Month Club, and th... \nMICHAEL (V.O.) Hey! God, it's so good to hear your voice. \nShe forgets herself.  Because it's good to hear his, too. \nMICHAEL (V.O.) I've been calling for days! \nJULIANNE Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally... \nMICHAEL (V.O., urgent) Look, I have to ask you something. \nShe swallows. \nMICHAEL (V.O.) Something so incredibly important, that if you turn me down, I don't know what I'll d... \nJULIANNE (bright) I just have to tell you this one thing first, okay? I mean this will hand you the biggest laugh of your adult life... \nSilence.  Come on girl, suck it up. \nJULIANNE I was thinking about you, and I remembered this unbelievably insane night we spent together in Tucson, like a thousand years ago? \nMore silence.  Really quiet. \nJULIANNE I mean, there's no way you could possibly remember the... \nMICHAEL (V.O., soft) Are you kidding? \nStops her.  Like a brick wall.  The sweetness in his voice. \nMICHAEL (V.O.) I think about that night all the time. \nShe's going to have a heart attack. \nMICHAEL (V.O.) But it's not why I called. \nShe blinks.  It's not.  And just as a tsunami of relief begins to sweep away... \nMICHAEL (V.O.) I called because I met someone. \nAnd her smiles breaks off.  Like a spine snapping.  Because there is something in his voice. \nJULIANNE Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee... \nMICHAEL (V.O.) You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody! \nNever.  She sits down, hard.  Right on the floor. \nMICHAEL (V.O.) And she's all wrong for me! \nJULIANNE Well, somet... \nMICHAEL (V.O.) I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you. \nLike when.  Julianne's mouth is suddenly dry. \nMICHAEL (V.O.) And her dad is like this billionaire who owns the White Sox and some cable empire, and you know how I've always been miserably awkward around those kinda stuffed suits... \nShe's finally making her mouth work... \nTears now.  Stand in her eyes. \nJULIANNE I'm making a big mistake, huh? \nDIGGER (shrugs) Maybe you'll learn something. \nHe wraps his hand over hers.  She looks down at it. \nJULIANNE I'm gonna bring him back, man. Against all odds, y'know.  Cos if I don't... \nShe wraps her fingers around his. \nJULIANNE ... I gotta live with it forever. \nLooks in his eyes. \nJULIANNE And at my wedding.  I'll be the only bride with her own best man. \nAnd she kisses his cheek. \nJumps out of his car.  Before she cries.  Yanks her bags from the back.  Brave smile. \nThey trade small salutes.  And then she's gone. \nINT.  O'HARA AIRPORT, CHICAGO - MORNING \nThe jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony called O'Hare.  Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons, trying to pull fly-away strands of hair into place, nervous as a schoolgirl, looking all around, and... \n... there he is.  MICHAEL is tall and square-shouldered, a boyish grin, an unruly shock of hair.  He looks gorgeous, sweet, and just dangerous enough to be irresistible.  Worthwhile stakes.  His face lights to see her, and she... \n... RUNS to his arms, shedding bags along the way, slamming off heedless civilians, to be... \n... SWEPT OFF the earth in strong arms, spun around, laughing like crazy, their cheeks tight together.  When he sets her down... \n... he kisses her nose.  His arms are still around her. \nMICHAEL (murmurs) Can you believe it? Can you believe I'm actually gonna do this? \nJULIANNE (lost in his eyes) Not hardly. \nHe beams.  Turns.  She follows his gaze, and... \n... there she is.  KIMBERLY WALLACE is 20, small and slender, but it is a body to die for.  The face is striking, not at all perky and vapid, but lovely and interesting.  Worst of all, intelligent. \nShe walks toward them purposefully, her eyes locked to the woman in her fiancee's arms.  At the last moment, Michael releases Julianne and Kimmy... \n... THROWS her arms around the startled visitor.  HOLDS her tight, with such genuine warmth that Julianne can only, slowly, hug back. As Michael beams. \nKIMMY This just makes everything so perfect. \nHer arms stay around the slightly dazed Julianne.  The younger girl leans close, confides... \nKIMMY All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that... \nJULIANNE Well, we're... \nKIMMY I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you. \nPale gray eyes.  Alive with joy and intimacy. \nKIMMY I've never had a sister. \nINT.  KIMMY'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY \nKimmy TEARING down the throughway in her Mercedes 500 SL, a dashing, confident driver.  Julianne riding shotgun, hair flying, a total wreck, in the open convertible.  Michael is happily crouched on the little platform behind their seats, hugging his knees.  The roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them. \nKIMMY My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor... \nJULIANNE You need a few dollars. \nKim glances over.  At eighty miles an hour.  A bittersweet look. \nKIMMY Dry.  Just like he said. \nHer eyes at once admiring and regretful. \nJULIANNE Excuse me? \nKIMMY I can be quick.  I can even be funny. \nShakes her head.  An endearing youngster. \nKIMMY But I can't be dry. \nJULIANNE Can you watch the road? \nKIMMY See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery. \nShe looks back to the highway. \nKIMMY This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav... \nJULIANNE ... you want a menage on your wedding night. \nKIMMY (straight back) No, that wouldn't be burdensome. \nJulianne studying the delicate, angular profile.  Hard not to like this kid. \nKIMMY My classmate Angelique shattered her pelvis line dancing in Abeline on Spring Break. \nLooks over.  The sweetest smile. \nKIMMY Be my maid of honor. \nJulianne just blinks. \nKIMMY Other than that... \nClosed SOLID.  Gone. \nINT.  DRESSING ROOM - LATER \nJulianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties, lighting one cigarette from the butt of another.  Suddenly, she hears... \n... an ARGUMENT outside the door.  Strains to listen.  It does sound like Michael and Kim.  We can't make out the words.  She jumps up, dashes for the door, STUBBING her toe on the platform, SHIT!, falls heavily AGAINST the door with a THUD that makes her wince, and... \n... the argument stops.  Damn.  She opens the door a crack.  Sees nothing.  Opens it wider to reveal... \n... a teenaged BOY looking right at her.  He sends a true shit- eating grin and she SLAMS the door hard enough to RATTLE walls. \nShe PACES furiously, helplessly, arms around her half-naked self, until... \n... soft knock.  The door opens a crack, and her daffodil gown comes through it. \nJULIANNE Come in, and shut the... \nStops.  Because it's Michael who has entered.  With the dress. \nJULIANNE ... door. \nSo he does.  She flushes and SNATCHES up her own clothes, which were characteristically tangled in a heap, and tries desperately to untangle them enough to cover herself.  He is amazed and amused by her embarrassment. \nMICHAEL (laughing) Should I turn around, or someth... \nJULIANNE Michael, I'm in my underwear! \nShe's TEARING at her clothes, only making more of a mess. \nMICHAEL We've seen each other a lot more naked than this. \nShe seems ready to rip her clothes apart, so he gently takes them from her hands.  She tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily untangles them. \nMICHAEL I mean, we were skinny-dipping in Greece, just as pals, less than two years ago. \nShe GRABS the clothes and covers the front of herself.  Looking at him with a mix of emotions she couldn't begin to sort out. \nJULIANNE Things are different now. \nHe looks in her eyes.  And nods, a little sadly.  Guess they are. \nMICHAEL (softly) Well.  I leave with two thoughts in my mind. \nHe walks to the door.  Puts his hand on the latch.  Looks back... \nMICHAEL (even softer) You're still a very pretty girl. \nThe look holds.  And holds.  There is such feeling on both sides, she doesn't know what to make of it.  She swallows. \nJULIANNE What's the sec... \nMICHAEL Mirrors. \nAnd he's gone.  She looks around at six different VIEWS of her uncovered backside.  Hmm. \nINT.  HOTEL UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY \nThe parking valets wait by their stand as the convertible pulls up. These girls must be late for something, the way they're jumping out of the car. \nJULIANNE ... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s... \nKIMMY What? Because I'm a little understand... \nJULIANNE ... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off. \nThe valet gives Kimmy her ticket. \nKIMMY I can't expect the NBA to hold up the playoffs... \nThey're walking fast toward the garage elevators... \nKIMMY I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye... \nJULIANNE So your honeymoon is exactly where? \nWell... \nKIMMY It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel... \nJULIANNE ... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit... \nAt the elevator.  Kimmy SLAMS the button. \nKIMMY It's his career, I'm supportive. Look, I've been everywhere, I've seen the world, I've laid on a beach. I want to be with the man I love. That's what makes it a honeymoon. \nEnd of story.  Okay? \nJULIANNE I'm just saying he's lucky. \nAn empty elevator arrives.  They get in. \nJULIANNE Takes one woman in a billion to put up with his array of shit. The guy is a one-man festival of idiosync... \nKimmy SLAMS the penthouse button.  Looks at her calmly.  Go on. \nJULIANNE Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of... \nKIMMY ... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...? \nJulianne imitates an incredibly annoying high-pitched SNARL.  Three times.  Kimmy nods. \nKIMMY Well now it has this sorta phlegm rattle behind it... \n... two identical stunning YOUNG WOMEN, serving as twin hostesses for the shower.  A beat of mutually-stupefied looks, and we hear the shoe CRASH somewhere, to a small spattering of SHRIEKS. \nMANDY Mah Gawd, it's the bride, and the woman she'll nevah live up to! \nKIMMY (mutters to Julianne) That would be us. \nSAMMY Did she say th' wrong thang agin? It is so in character! \nAMANDA and SAMANTHA NEWHOUSE, 19-year-old twins.  True Southern belles, with the faces of angels and bodies made for hot oil wrestling.  Mandy's hair is dyed ash blonde, Sammy's is amber. Otherwise, the experience is similar. \nJULIANNE (thrusts out her hand) I'm Julianne Potter, and... \nSAMMY ... we'd be the vengeful sluts. We came in complementary colors. \nMANDY Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one. \nJULIANNE ... unless he has a hump. \nThe girls cast identical blank looks at Kimberly. \nKIMMY (to the sluts) Dry.  I told you. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) Is this Michael's Julianne? \nAll eyes turn to an elegant woman of barely 40.  She has her daughter's hair and eyes and slender form.  But the bearing rules half an empire.  Fonda would envy. \nISABELLE I'm Isabelle Wallace, and my handsome new son scarcely did you justice, girl. \nShe takes both of Julianne's hands, and our heroine is sort of magically charmed.  As if touched by Glinda the Good Witch of the North. \nISABELLE Now, my husband says to scoot you over to the ballpark, so you can hang with Michael.  But first, you have to meet a lot of really old women. \nLooking warmly in her eyes... \nISABELLE That is, if you've absorbed enough profanity. \nFlicks a glance at the twins.  Leads Julianne off... \nMANDY (O.S., pouting) We sayed one fuck. \nINT.  TAXI, SOUTH SIDE - DAY \nCab crawling toward COMISKEY PARK through stifling traffic. Julianne oblivious, cellular to her ear... \nJULIANNE Desperate measures! Do you hear me?  Digger, are you the... \nSQUAWK.  Static.  Then... \nJULIANNE I don't know, hit men, whoopee cushions, saltpeter, something! The girl is impossibly impregnable. Even I want her to get the guy!! \nListens. \nJULIANNE Tell him the what? The truth...?? \nShe shakes her head.  What a guy. \nJULIANNE That desperate.  May I never get. \nINT.  LUXURY BOX, COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON \nGame in progress.  Watched by Michael, three groomsmen his age, two middle-aged men, and one bodyguard.  Suddenly, a dull THUMPING at the door.  It keeps up.  They finally all look over.  The bodyguard gets the door, revealing... \nJULIANNE Which of you gents ordered two beers? \nOne single tray.  Holding fourteen beers.  Balancing on one hand. Michael JUMPS UP, terrified at the impending mayhem this sight suggests... \nMICHAEL Wow!  Lemme give you a ha... \nJULIANNE (sweetly) Michael.  You'll unwittingly imply that I'm clumsy. \nHe stops in his tracks.  The guys whistle. \nMICHAEL Think of that.  And as well as I know you. \nShe goes first to the bodyguard. \nBODYGUARD Sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty. \nJULIANNE (lovely smile) It's Miss.  And thanks.  That leaves two for me. \nHeads down the row... \nMICHAEL Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Gerry from SI, and you know Daniel... \nShe's nodding, flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter of the tray, keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center. Michael is flat dumbstruck.  Next, a tall patrician gentleman with rolled-up sleeves on his hand-stitched silk shirt... \nMICHAEL Oh.  This is my father-in-law, Walter. \nOnce again, she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished father-in-law... \nMICHAEL How are you doing this? You're on drugs. \nSets them down.  The man has a smile wonderful in its ease. Murmurs... \nWALTER If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show. \nJULIANNE I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question. \nWALTER Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules. \nJULIANNE Nice meeting you, too, Walt. \nA nod between equals.  She moves on... \nMICHAEL And, this guy, you know... \nA slender black woman sings a SOARING Gospel number, backed by three ladies who could each solo in any church choir.  It is mesmerizing, stirring, transcendent.  The unseen audience CLAPPING FIERCELY in rhythm, SHOUTING support.  SLOW PAN now... \n... every face is black.  We aren't in church at all, but a venerable blue club.  One of those places you'd swear everybody's played, from Robert Johnson to Bessie Smith and back again.  As the song ends, there is APPLAUSE, some RAPPING on tables with their knuckles or their drunks.  We keep PANNING to a far corner.  Three faces. \nJulianne leans across her beer to Kimmy... \nJULIANNE How'd you find this pl... \nKim shaking her head.  Looks admiringly to Michael... \nKIMMY Lived here my whole life, never heard of it.  Until our first date. \nShe reaches slender fingers.  Traces one back along his hair. \nKIMMY He finds all these spots, everywhere he goes, it's a mystical gift. \nMICHAEL (shy) Jesus, one d-back from the Bears knows a place... \nKIMMY It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the... \nJULIANNE ... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff... \nKIMMY Stop, we're embarrassing h... \nJULIANNE ... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes... \nMICHAEL I tried those on.  When you weren't looking. \nNow he's grinning at Julianne.  And she likes that a lot. \nJULIANNE Where was that, Florence, huh? \nMICHAEL Firenze. \nTogether in the memory.  As Kimmy watches. \nJULIANNE The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night? \nMICHAEL Till the gas ran out. \nAnd, the first sniff of left-out... \nKIMMY I love Florence. \nJulianne's eyes flicker.  Could this be a teensy opening? Keeps her eyes, her easy smile, and her killer instincts trained on Michael. \nJULIANNE Take her there. \nHe nods, okay. \nJULIANNE I mean, now.  She's perky, she deserves a honeymoon. \nHe draws a breath... \nJULIANNE I heard.  If San Antone sweeps Sacramento.  What is this shit? You gotta get off the road by September anyway, when does Fall Quarter start? \nAnd the happy couple look at each other.  They are awkward. Julianne's heart soar like eagle. \nKIMMY Uh.  I'm not coming back.  For senior year. \nCould this be.  The Mother Lode? \nJULIANNE Don't architects find a degree, sort of... an asset? \nThe couple still staring in each other's eyes. \nKIMMY Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now... \nMICHAEL I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps... \nKIMMY The most important thing. Is being together. \nAnd she smiles.  Beautifully. \nKIMMY I'm just a baby.  I've got all... the time... in the world. \nEXT.  CLUB - NIGHT \nMichael putting Kim in the back of a cab.  As Julianne watches. \nMICHAEL Because I could come... \nKIMMY To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...? \nJULIANNE (calls out, helpful) They're gonna drool anyway! \nKim smiles.  He kisses her, tenderly, through the open window.  She waves past him at Julianne. \nKIMMY (to both) Enjoy each other. \nAnd drives off.  As he watches after, Julianne comes up behind him. Slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle.  Starts giving a little massage. \nJULIANNE Should I whistle down a cab? \nMICHAEL Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember? \nTurns his head, to see her.  She's still rubbing his shoulder. \nJULIANNE Sometimes.  About the dumbest things. \nShare a smile.  As always, it covers a lot of years. \nMICHAEL The El's right down the street. Unless you're afraid of the neighborhood. \nShe looks around.  It is an issue.  But she remembers... \nMAITRE D' It's unofficial, of course.  But, traditionally, the humidor is for gentlemen, only... \nJULIANNE Great.  I've got this girlfriend at the Justice Department?  With all this time on her hands? \nHer look is every bit as hard as his.  He gestures to the escalator.  She takes Kimmy's hand, and up they go.  We can see Walter in a big leather chair, enjoying a major stogie.  Kimmy licks her lips. \nThey enter.  Every head turns.  A nice range of reactions, from offended to attracted and points in between. \nJULIANNE (murmurs) Piece of cake.  I'll hang, and think happy thoughts... \nKimmy nods.  Heads over toward her father.  Julianne walks, confidently, even provocatively, to the wall lined with bins of cigars.  Every eye in the place is on her butt. \nShe runs her fingers over a few contenders.  Plucks one out, examines it, puts it back.  Walks a little farther.  Selects another, big and black.  Rolls it expertly in her fingers.  Sniffs along its length. \nA guy comes over.  Could be 40, successful, a broker's pin-stripe. Nearly as attractive as he thinks he is. \nGUY Know what you're looking for, little lady? \nLittle lady, huh? She glances at his coven of buddies, who pretend not to notice.  Then, straight to the guy's blue eyes. \nJULIANNE Yeah.  Do you? \nGUY I asked first. \nAh.  Wit.  She holds up her cigar... \nJULIANNE I like 'em long and hard.  Kind of... big around. \nRuns it under her nose. \nJULIANNE Smell is important, I'm a believer in that. \nTakes a match from a cut crystal bowl. \nJULIANNE But you never know what you've got.  Till you run your tongue over it. \nAnd she does.  Moistening the full length of the cigar.  The boys are laughing openly.  She STRIKES the match.  As she lights up... \nGUY I meant.  What you're looking for in a man. \nShe glances at his wedding ring.  Then, straight into his eyes. \nJULIANNE Actually, I'm partial to married gentlemen. \nThe way she says that.  The guy swallows.  We can see some of the air has been sucked from the room. \nGUY Why is that? \nJULIANNE It's so much time.  When I phone the wives. \nExplosive LAUGHTER from the peanut gallery.  As she jams the big Clemente Churchill into her mouth, she sees Kimmy waving her over from across the room.  Without even looking at the guy she's just put away... \n... she crosses the room, Walter stands politely, looking very dapper, very powerful, and focusing on her with considerable interest.  He waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather hassock. \nWALTER (simply) Your idea? \nShe can't read this guy.  Maybe that's how he built an empire.  She nods, yeah. \nWALTER You're a woman of insight. \nHe sits on the arm of his chair.  Close enough to speak quietly. \nWALTER My wife and I love this marriage, and deplore its circumstances. \nHe puffs his cigar.  Julianne puffs her.  Kimmy looks on, a kid watching the grown-ups... \nWALTER As you guessed, my daughter is unhappy about giving up her life. And, in my opinion, cowardly in avoiding the necessary confrontation. \nThen he stops.  As if reading Julianne's eyes. \nWALTER Mike has a world of ability. I'd do anything to have him in my company. \nOne more puff. \nWALTER Except ask him. \nJulianne is a little stunned.  Kimmy looks helpless. \nWALTER He'd resent it.  And me.  And, most important, Kim. \nNo smile on his lips.  Straight talk. \nWALTER He's a great kid, but he's still a kid.  Instead of recognizing that his resistance comes from insecurity, he'd turn it to anger. To protect himself... \nSpreads his hands... \nWALTER ... from realizing that he's ignoring my daughter's needs, despite how very much he loves her. \nHe looks to his daughter now. \nWALTER They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time. \nJULIANNE (softly) I think you're making a mistake, sir. \nHis eyes come back to her.  A little sharply. \nWALTER And that interests me.  How someone who knows him so well could be so wrong. \nA formidable guy.  She meets his gaze. \nJULIANNE See, I love him, too, as much as anyone here.  And for a whole lot longer. \nFrom her heart. \nJULIANNE I think I know best what would make him happy. \nJulianne in T-shirt and shorts, rushes onto the deck of a sprawling beach club.  Clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene... \n... the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party. Young folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people.  We SCAN with her to find a crowd around... \n... a three-on-three volleyball game.  Kimmy and two groomsmen on one side, facing Michael and the Tennessee debs.  The twins wear spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as predictably uninhabited.  As the next point begins, Kimmy serves... \n... Sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to Mandy who sets for Michael's vicious SPIKE straight THROUGH his best man's hapless defense.  The crowd cheers Michael, and as he turns, Mandy gives him a savage... \n... CHEST BUMP of congratulation, that any NFL linebacker would be proud of.  It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt. Laughter, applause.  The twins pull him up and Sammy gives him a hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react.  Kim plays good sport.  Julianne watches Michael's body for a beat, then... \n... dashes off.  Down the beach, several barbecue grills have been set up.  Manned by beach club staff and family alike.  Michael's pop, Joe, is dispensing beers from a keg.  Kim's mom, Isabelle, is coordinating the beans, potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table. Julianne races across the sand to... \n... a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs, clearly enjoying himself.  Julianne runs up to him, says something into his ear.  He looks at her.  Then turns his station over to a club steward, and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside. \nCLOSE now.  As they stroll together, she's a little breathless. He's watching her profile, curious, silent.  At the water's edge... \nJULIANNE (whispers) Is anybody watching? \nWALTER I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me. \nShe reaches into her big bag.  Pulls out a single folded sheet of paper. \nJULIANNE I picked up Michael's messages for him, at our hotel.  I stole one... \nHis face darkens.  The easy smile fades.  He holds up his palms... \nWALTER Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something... \nJULIANNE Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right? \nHis smile returns.  Just a little. \nWALTER Matter of fact, that's how I got married. \nThe look holds.  She thrusts the paper out.  He still doesn't take it. \nJULIANNE It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss. \nWALTER (quickly) I know Ben. \nShe opens the paper. \nJULIANNE \"Mike.  We still have no answer to our E-mail of Wednesday.  Which option do you select? I don't mean to rush you, but Personnel needs to tie up the loose ends.\" \nHe takes the paper.  We see it now.  Looks authentic. \nJULIANNE I think he's been fired. \nWALTER It doesn't say th... \nJULIANNE He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job. \nHe looks up.  He's listening.  Closely. \nJULIANNE And why I couldn't say anything before in front of Kim. \nShe bites her lip.  Seems so earnest. \nJULIANNE I just think of how... desperate he must be feeling.  He's marrying a rich man's daughter, and he's about to become destitute.  You know the kind of job market he'll be facing? \nHe does. \nWALTER And you think he's kept this to himself. \nJULIANNE He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating. \nHe's staring at her.  But his mind is working behind his eyes. \nJULIANNE If you do it now, it's like he's helping you.  He can accept with dignity. \nHe taps the paper with the back of his knuckles. \nWALTER This fax could mean... any number of things... \nShe nods.  She knows that. \nWALTER (softly) Maybe.  I should call Ben. \nJULIANNE Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I. \nShe takes the paper back. \nJULIANNE What if, what if I could find that E-mail? \nThe long straight look.  Maybe he's hooked. \nJULIANNE I never noticed.  Kimmy has your eyes. \nINT.  LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - TWILIGHT \nTall, gangly, young DESK CLERK.  Lank hair, pimples.  He looks up, beams to see... \nJULIANNE Hello, again. \nShe's flirting her ass off. \nJULIANNE You still haven't straightened that tie. \nAnd she reaches across the desk with her lovely, slender hands. Does it for him.  Her fingers brush his chest on the way back.  We can assume a woody. \nJULIANNE You know, my friend, the one whose message I picked up...  ? \nHe does.  His eyes flick toward his stately female SUPERVISOR, helping another guest across the way. \nJULIANNE Well, he's still with the wedding party.  And he asked me to get something he needs real badly from his room...  ? \nShe smiles up at him.  The best she can. \nKIMMY Moral support. \nShe loves him so much, and she is sick with worry. \nKIMMY What's good of having a big sister, if she... \nStops.  Gestures with her eyes.  Because her big sister has just entered... \n... looking fabulous.  Julianne wears a long sleek sarong, slightly see-through.  Her hair is bound up with silver pins.  As she moves through the room toward us, we can see that, for once, her make-up is flawless, understated.  When she arrives at the table... \n... Michael is beaming, admiringly.  He stands up. \nMICHAEL (softly) Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this? \nJULIANNE Never can tell. \nHe holds her chair.  She exchanges an intimate smile with the anxious Kim. \nMICHAEL You make me think of that song, we used to... \nAnd he starts humming.  The song is, \"The Way You Look Tonight.\" \nMICHAEL (singing) Someday.  When I'm awfully low... \nThey sit.  He looks from Julianne to his bride. \nMICHAEL Okay, kid.  You're on. \nKim's eyes flick to Julianne, who nods, supportively.  The kid takes a breath. \nKIMMY It's really my father.  Who needs the favor. \nHis face sort of comes to a stop.  Nothing she can read, yet.  He nods, yeah...? \nKIMMY He's... he's reorganizing some of the divisions of the company... \nHis eyes flick to Julianne.  She looks down. \nMICHAEL (quiet) He never mentioned that.  Neither did y... \nKIMMY (blurting) ... and public relations is a big problem area for him. \nShe can see it now.  In his eyes.  She just can't tell how bad. \nKIMMY He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust... \nMICHAEL Like family, huh? \nSo quiet.  So cold.  She is terrified. \nKIMMY It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him... \nMICHAEL To him. \nShe swallows.  Straightens her spine. \nKIMMY And to m... \nMICHAEL (sharp, to Julianne) ... and you knew about this. \nReal quiet.  Against the noise of this place. \nJULIANNE I think you ought to listen to her, Michael.  This is her life, too. \nJust the thing.  To bring that anger near the surface.  He turns to Kim... \nMICHAEL Well, which is it? \nA demand.  Sharp.  Accusing.  She doesn't like that... \nMICHAEL You gonna tell me Daddy thought this one up? All of a sudden, I'm the only jerk alive who can help him deal with the press? \nShe's trapped.  Angry, scared.  A deer in headlights. \nMICHAEL Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec... \nJULIANNE Michael!! \nKIMMY (near tears) I am honest! \nSilence. \nKIMMY All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life... \nMICHAEL Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans! \nHe can't even believe he's hearing this. \nMICHAEL I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late! \nKIMMY What is that sup... \nMICHAEL And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient. \nShrugs. \nMICHAEL No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's \"needs,\" and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society. \nJULIANNE (softly) Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun... \nMICHAEL (whips around) Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances! \nGlares in her eyes. \nShe looks in his eyes.  Realizing at last. \nJULIANNE You flew all the way h... \nDIGGER I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons. \nJULIANNE (soft) You're butting in. \nHe still holds her wrists.  She brings one of his hands to her lips.  Kisses his knuckles. \nJULIANNE (softer) I really resent this. \nINT.  BATHROOM - MORNING \nJulianne seated at the sink, staring into the mirror, as Digger gently applies soup, cloth and water to easing away the mask.  A paleontologist restoring a Bronze Age artifact.  By the side of the half-filled sink, rests her plugged-in curling iron. \nJULIANNE What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit. \nDIGGER You like her. \nJULIANNE If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her. \nShe looks up at him and WINCES, as the movement makes him scrape her face.  He's sorry. \nJULIANNE Last night, she was crying, these big, real tears, when she thought she'd lost him.  It was like there was a knife in her heart... \nLooking in his eyes.  Needs him to hear. \nJULIANNE ... and I put it there.  I hated myself, I grieved for her, I couldn't enjoy one second of it! And then, when it didn't work... \nCan you believe this? \nJULIANNE I was devastated. \nDIGGER (softly) Go figure you. \nJULIANNE Because I realized.  When I see him say \"I do,\" that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every... \nShe holds his wrists now.  To stop him.  To plead for understanding.  Forgiveness. \nJULIANNE ... every time I think of him, forever, which could be a lot. \nShe almost choked on that last part.  So she composes herself. \nJULIANNE You watch a guy caress his girlfriend's butt.  You see an Old Spice commercial.  Sentimental moments are everywhere, when you're in the right frame of mind. \nShe swallows hard.  Fights for a grip on her determination. \nJULIANNE There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years... \nDIGGER You've been working on this, huh? \nJULIANNE ... and having \"done the right thing\" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times. \nShe sets her jaw. \nJULIANNE This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless. \nDIGGER (quietly) And you believe that. \nJULIANNE (unconvincing) Sure. \nHis eyes are gentle and merciless at once.  No way she gets off this hook. \nJULIANNE He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can. \nDIGGER It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about... \nJULIANNE (proudly) I don't know the meaning of the word guilt! \nDIGGER Impressive. \nJULIANNE I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus! \nDIGGER The man you love. \nJULIANNE Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts! \nDIGGER Someday she'll thank you. \nJULIANNE Let's not get carried away. \nAnd the defenses drain from her clay-ravaged features.  The real Julianne is glimpsed. \nJULIANNE I'd settle for.  Someday, I'll forgive myself. \nFor...? \nJULIANNE For doing this terrible thing. \nHer eyes tear up. \nJULIANNE Which, by the way, I can't figure out how to do. \nAs the tears fall, he wipes at them, discovering... \nDIGGER Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m... \nJULIANNE I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF! \nOh. \nJULIANNE Guess what I brushed my teeth with last night? \nHe thinks about this.  Following her eyes to the toiletries kit, he browses for a moment... \nMICHAEL (sings) I will feel a glow just Thinking of you... And the way you look.  Tonight. \nHe stops.  Smiles that sweet, boyish smile. \nMICHAEL Dance card filled? \nJULIANNE I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days. \nHe holds up his arms.  And she moves into them.  He begins to dance with her, turning so slowly.  And, yes, people are watching. \nMICHAEL (sings in her ear) With each word, your tenderness grows, Tearing my fears apart... \nShe holds him closer.  Bites her lip. \nMICHAEL (sings) And that laugh That wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart. \nHe stops.  He looks at her.  She's still in his arms. \nMICHAEL Where did we first hear th... \nJULIANNE (straight back) The night we met. \nRight to his eyes... \nJULIANNE The night we fell in love. \nHe doesn't know what to do with that. \nMICHAEL So we heard it... like, right that... that first... \nJULIANNE We danced to it.  Just like this. \nJust like this.  A long beat.  And he has to say... \nMICHAEL I won't lose you, will I? \nHer eyes close.  Then open.  Utterly lost in his. \nJULIANNE No.  Because I won't let you. \nINT.  WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY \nJulianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress shirt.  Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through the Saturday-deserted office space.  Desks, cubicles, monitors, silent.  A row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for the custodian.  Turning a corner, we hear... \n... life, at the end of the hallway.  A grand conference room with a glass wall.  Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting for five.  DEIDRE, his personal secretary, clicking every word into her laptop at warp speed.  Walter sees Julianne through the glass. A comic take of pleased surprise.  He comes out to greet her... \nWALTER I thought Michael was picking me up. \nJULIANNE I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials. \nMeaning, you.  They smile at each other.  Then... \nWALTER Kim said, when he turned down the job, there was no friction. \nJulianne thinks back. \nJULIANNE Friction.  No. \nHe smiles at her line reading.  But his mind is always probing. \nWALTER I haven't caused... a problem, have I? \nJULIANNE Nobody has.  So far. \nHer bright grin.  His eyes linger on it. \nWALTER Well, you're a little early... \nJULIANNE I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office? \nINT.  WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY \nJulianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city. Closes the door, quietly, behind her.  So anxious, she is practically hyperventilating.  She goes, slowly to the vacant cherrywood desk.  Its computer and monitor standing silent.  She is stalking it, like a deadly animal.  And then.  She is there. \nTalking to herself, her own desperate support network... \nJULIANNE (softly) You can do this. \nSacred, filled with doubt and conflict.  Her hands clutch at each other.  Then, one flicks out.  And the computer goes ON.  The screen GLOWS.  Waits for her.  Her mouth is sand, her stomach water.  She pulls the paper from her pocket... \n... looks at it.  Looks to the monitor.  And begins.  To type... \nJULIANNE (mumbling to herself) E-mail address.  To Ben Isaacson, Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated, from... Walter Wallace. \nAnd stops.  Her heart is thumping. \nJULIANNE See, you can do it.  It's easy. \nDoesn't look easy.  Licks her lips. \nJULIANNE You do it fast, it's over.  Like it never happened. \nShe sits.  And recites as she types... \nJULIANNE Ben.  I need a favor. \nHere we go.  This is it.  Types... \nJULIANNE My daughter's every happiness. And my wife's.  And, least of all, my own, are in your hands. \nNods, okay.  Breathing hard.  Types... \nJULIANNE Knowing you value our friendship, and the... cooperative relationship between our companies... I am hopeful of your help. \nTouch, that.  Thinks.  It has to be.  Types... \nNow.  He really doesn't get it. \nJULIANNE I mean, tomorrow... we'll all be busy with more important things. So... \nSo? \nJULIANNE ... tonight's my last chance. \nHe sighs. \nMICHAEL I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible. \nJULIANNE It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves. \nHelpless. \nJULIANNE We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou... \nMICHAEL Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there... \nHer eyes fill with tears.  He is mystified.  Smiles tenderly. \nMICHAEL (softly) Give it up, kid. \nTouches her hair. \nMICHAEL You can't win 'em all. \nAnd slowly, he takes her hand.  Leads her way.  She takes one backward glance at the locked door.  Her last dream dies. \nINT.  LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON - NIGHT \nMichael and a disconsolate Julianne board the elevator.  He presses 15, she pushes 11.  Michael carries a handful of messages slips and an envelope.  As the car starts up, she folds her arms across her chest, at the edge of tears.  He doesn't know what to do. \nMICHAEL (gently) Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be? \nJULIANNE (voice nearly cracking) You're right.  Easy come, easy go. \nHe's really concerned, can't bear to see her so upset. \nMICHAEL (softly) Jules? \nShe won't look at him.  She wants to die.  The bell RINGS, the doors open to her floor.  She just walks out. \nAnd he follows.  They stand now, she with her arms crossed, lip trembling.  She can't believe how close she is to losing it. \nMICHAEL This thing means that much to y... \nJULIANNE It means a lot. \nHe nods.  Okay. \nMICHAEL I'll call the house, Walter's probably not even asleep... \nHer mouth drops.  She can't believe this. \nMICHAEL I'll drive you out there, we'll get the key, we'll go back to the office... \nShe THROWS her arms around his, HUGGING him so hard, so close.  He laughs, she is so weird.  She pulls back, beaming, glowing. \nMICHAEL Come on, we'll call from your room. \nShe claps his hand.  As they head down the hall... \nMICHAEL If I fall asleep on the altar tomorrow... \nHe's trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand... \nMICHAEL ... you better be there to... funny, these are all from Ben. \nShe's at her door, turning the key.  He looks at the envelope. \nMICHAEL The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone... \nJULIANNE (entering her room) ... maybe it's congratulations. \nHe follows her in, opening the envelope.  Stops.  Reads.  And his face suddenly... freezes.  To stone. \nJULIANNE (turning to him) Michael? What ha... \nMICHAEL (reading) Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know... \nAnd he looks up to her. \nMICHAEL ... what you're marrying into. \nHe hands it toward her.  She takes it, hesitantly, and he walks past. Toward the phone. \nJULIANNE (reading) I received the following E-mail this afternoon... \"Ben, I need a favor.  My daughter's every happiness...  \" \nHer eyes BUG OUT of her head.  Holy shit! We can hear him DIALING the phone.  She keeps reading, it's all there.  How did this happen? \nMICHAEL (O.S.) Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim... \nJULIANNE (reading) \"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down...\" \nMICHAEL (O.S.) I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks. \nJULIANNE (reading) \"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl.\" \nAnd when she turns... \nMICHAEL Jules.  Could you give me a minute? \nHe looks more sick than angry.  As if the heart has just been cut out of him.  She doesn't know what to say or do, so she just stands, staring dumbly. \n... he pulls the ring OFF.  Nothing to it.  She blinks. \nJULIANNE It's mental, you know. \nHe doesn't understand that. \nJULIANNE Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something... \nMICHAEL I just want to be alone.  Is that okay? \nShe nods, sure.  He kisses her cheek.  Stands up. \nMICHAEL Maybe I'll go back to New York. Hang with you for awhile, huh? Ben'll understand. \nShe nods again.  Whatever you say.  He steps into the open doorway... \nMICHAEL Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time. \nJULIANNE If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento... \nThey smiles at each other.  For real. \nJULIANNE I've never been to Texas. \nImagine that.  The look holds.  Just above a whisper... \nMICHAEL Thanks for coming to my wedding. \nAnd then he's gone. \nIN.JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT \nJulianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror, eyeing her image with evident dissatisfaction, as she listens to the receiver RINGING. \nDIGGER (V.O.  MACHINE) Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual. \nBEEP. \nJULIANNE Hey, handsome.  Brevity this... \nHer eyes find the pack of cigarettes.  Next to her toiletries kit. \nJULIANNE (softly) I won. \nHer fingers touch the pack.  As if an object of significance.  Takes it up. \nJULIANNE Amazing, huh?  I didn't do things quite your way.  But... I got it down. \nCradling the phone against her shoulder, she carefully tears the top of the pack completely open. \nJULIANNE And forty years and nine grand- children later, when I sit with Michael on some rustic porch, slogging through our sweet swamp of nostalgic memories... \nReaches the pack toward the toilet. \nJULIANNE No one is going to sweet the details... \nTurns it upside down, emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john. \nJULIANNE Of one weekend in Chicago. \nDrops the lid with a CLATTER.  Hits the FLUSH. \nJULIANNE Talk about celebration... \nShe lifts a tube from her toiletries kit.  Stares at it, real close. \nJULIANNE I'm gonna brush my teeth with actual toothpaste. \nTurns it over, reads all the writing.  Yep. \nJULIANNE I guess I'm too exhausted to feel the elation I so richly undeserve... \nSqueezes some paste onto her brush.  Carefully. \nJULIANNE So I'm gonna hold calls at the desk... while I get my... \nStart brushing. \nJULIANNE (around, her mouthful) God, it is toothpaste, they should sell this stuff commercially! Anyway, a girl does need her... \nSquints at her image.  Laughs, spewing a little foam. \nJULIANNE ... well, we're a bit past worrying about beauty sleep. Let's just settle for not frightening small animals. \nShe SPITS.  Tells Digger's machine... \nJULIANNE Anyway, I couldn't have done it without you.  Even though I did, if you follow that. \nWipes her mouth.  Stares off.  The eyes a little dreamy. \nJULIANNE Three words:  Happily.  Ever. Well, you know. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - MORNING \nJulianne sprawled all over the bed, mouth open like a carp, sleeping mask against the daylight.  A sudden RAPPING at the door, and she... \n... sits BOLT UPRIGHT.  Utterly disoriented, until she pulls off the mask.  Stumbles out of bed, walking toward the firm KNOCKING, when... \n... it stops.  A message slip SLIDES beneath her door.  She lifts it, barely conscious.  This wakes her up.  In one. \nJULIANNE (to the slip) You're going where? \nEXT.  WALLACE ESTATE - DAY \nJULIANNE When are you gonna come clean with your folks? \nKIMMY Don't you see... \nJULIANNE If you're waiting for \"Do you take this man?\", that's considered poor form. \nKIMMY ... that this is all my fault? \nStops Julianne cold.  Your fault. \nKIMMY Whatever delusions I drove him to, there is truth at the heart of it. I want him to work for my father. I want to stay in school.  I want a life of my own! \nHarder and harder for Julianne to push.  Her mouth is dry. \nJULIANNE Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat... \nKIMMY I love him. \nFragile and strong at once.  A plea. \nKIMMY Tell him it's my fault and that I love him. \nA long beat. \nJULIANNE I'll be right back. \nEXT.  TENNIS COURT - DAY \nThe court has become a giant holding pen for tonight's BALLOONS. There are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all directions, under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread across the top of the court's chain-link fence. \nMichael stands outside the court, clutching the chain link like a prisoner, as Julianne comes through the gate.  From somewhere, we hear high, squeaky, alien voice-like SOUNDS.  Incongruous against... \nMICHAEL How is she? \nJulianne absorbs this.  As the bizarre SOUNDS continue, she WHIRLS around... \nJULIANNE KNOCK IT OFF!!! \nWe now see three STONER COLLEGE GUYS, who have been filling the endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court. Clearly, they've been inhaling their working materials. \nSTONER KID (Minnie Mouse) YES, SIR! \nA Nazi salute.  When she turns back... \nMICHAEL I asked you... \nJULIANNE She admits it's her fault. \nHe absorbs that.  And then... \nMICHAEL Do you think she still loves me? \nWe watch the struggle inside her.  Her voice drops... \nJULIANNE Sure, she does.  She's crazy about you. \nNow tears stand in both their eyes.  The stoners are doing their Alvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the B.G., singing in castrato harmony.  But our two don't notice. \nMICHAEL I keep asking, how can I explain what happened? And I keep getting that same answer all night long. \nWhich is... \nMICHAEL I can't.  And it doesn't matter. I drove her to it, because I want things my way.  And even if she did something tricky and unfair... she was blinded by love, okay? \nJulianne swallows.  For obvious reasons. \nJULIANNE Does that make it right... \nMICHAEL Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love. \nThe stoner are now helium-crooning \"Bridge Over Troubled Waters.\" Actually, they're getting better. \nMICHAEL She's giving up half her life for me, and I'm bitching because it hurts her. \nSTONERS (singing) Sail on silver girl Sail on by... \nMICHAEL She's a saint!  And I'm a worthless ingrate! \nSTONERS (singing) Your time has come to shine, All your dreams are on their way... \nMICHAEL Tell her.  I'll marry her at six o'clock, if she'll still have me. \nThe stoners blend on the high note.  It's pretty moving. \nJULIANNE I'll be right back. \nINT.  ORGAN LOFT - DAY \nPAN along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents.  Nearly twelve feet high, the pile curves along the balcony, high above the diners in the Great Room, extending al the way to... \n... an organ loft.  Alone, above the noise of the party, Julianne and Kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase.  Trapped between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth organ.  Dwarfed by their surroundings, Kimmy draws the hardest breath of her life... \nKIMMY (whispers) So.  What did he say? \nJulianne's eyes move over the young girl's face. \nJULIANNE He said.  Marry me. \nKimmy YELPS in her ecstasy, FLINGING herself against Julianne, and they go DOWN full length across the organ's pedals, BLASTING the room with a MONSTER CHORD of china-rattling volume and horrifying disharmony. \nAs grown men and women SCREAM in spontaneous terror below, Kimmy begins to... \n... LAUGH.  And KISS and hug her new sister.  And holds her tight. \nEXT.  WILLOW POND - DAY \n... Michael is racing for the cars.  Julianne, sprinting her guts out, losing ground with every stride.  Michael JUMPS into a Cherokee... \nJULIANNE MICHAEL, DON'T, YOU'LL NEVER CATCH HER!! \nHe GRINDS the gears.  She keeps RUNNING.  His engine FIRES. \nJULIANNE SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!! \nHe BLASTS OFF.  She keeps going.  Gasping for air, clutching her side, she's dying here.  Slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit! Next, a butcher's van, looks inside, Jesus! \nJULIANNE (to the world at large) DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS ANYMORE?  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO TRUST?? \nUp ahead, Michael has STALLED the Cherokee.  She still has a chance, DASHES to the next van.  BORNSTEIN EXTERMINATION, a handsome rendering of a rat above the TOXIC MATERIALS warning FLINGS the door open.  Stumbles in.  Keys! \nJULIANNE (O.S.) THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!! \nMichael SPEEDS away.  She KICKS the ratmobile in gear. \nLURCHES off. \nINT.  RATMOBILE, DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - DAY \nJulianne tearing through traffic, desperately struggling to keep Michael's Cherokee in view, while she shrieks into her cellular... \nJULIANNE IT IS NOT GOING WELL! \nDown the block, Michael WHIPS around a corner.  We follow suit to see his destination dead ahead.  Union Station.  The DISPATCHER RADIO intrudes... \nDISPATCHER (O.S.) Uh, Unit Four Baker Charlie, how we cookin' on that Skokiie infestation? \nNow she's steering the car, tearing at the radio controls, and screaming into the phone cradled on her shoulder... \nJULIANNE THIS IS WHAT COMES OF TELLING THE TRUTH! \nFIELD MAN (O.S.) Copy, dispatcher... \nJULIANNE OR EVEN PART OF IT! \nFIELD MAN (O.S.) Uh, what happens if you got that methyl-ethyl shit on your hands? \nMichael RIPS into the train station's parking lot.  We SWERVE around a taxi, CUT OFF Harley, CAREEN into the lot... \nJULIANNE GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE IS NOT FAIR! \nDISPATCHER (O.S.) Uh, you got maybe thirty seconds before you're sterile.  For God's sake don't touch yourself, or anything. \nUp ahead, Michael is OUT of his jeep and running. \nJULIANNE AND I HATE TALKING TO YOUR MACHINE! \nShe SLAMS on the brakes, THROWING herself against the wheel. \nYOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.) Uh, this is One Monkey Zebra. It wasn't bees in the gal's wall, it was cats! \nShe TEARS the door open.  SCRAMBLE OUT... \nYOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.) She says gas 'em, anyway, she'll pay cash.  Uh... how do I pay this? \nWITH Julianne now, RACING through the lot, Michael vanishes INTO the Station, she PLUNGES in after him, BOUNCING off bystanders, apologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion, threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk, catching a lucky glimpse as he heads... \n... DOWN a staircase to the TRACKS.  My God, what's he doing?  A second wind, fueled by panic, and she BOLTS after him, DANCING down the steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the concourse to see him, running for... \n... Track 29, a train already RUMBLING, ready to pull out, she SPRINTS after him. \nJULIANNE MICHAEL!! \nHe DISAPPEARS behind the train, she FALLS, skids, springs up, pushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train PULLS AWAY... \nJULIANNE NNNOOOO!!! \nBut he's just standing there.  His back to us.  Watching it go. \nHer body nearly collapses with relief.  She pushes herself on, but her legs aren't working right in their maxed-out fatigue, and she lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him.  He's still lost in thought, staring after the train. \nShe tries to speak, but there's no breath.  So she puts her hands on her knees and just GASPS for air like a dog.  Wheezing, panting, trying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually turns and... \n... JUMPS out of his skin!  A heart attack seeing her. \nJULIANNE (croaks) Don't speak! \nHe just blinks at this sweaty, ripped-up, maniacal figure. \nMICHAEL Uh.  I saw that moving... \nJULIANNE DON'T SPEAK! \nFLINGING both her hands across his mouth.  A frozen beat.  He nods, okay.  Cautiously, she takes her hands away.  At least she has made him smile, in spite of everything.  At least she's done that. \nJULIANNE I have to make a confession. Another confession.  Besides that I love you.  This is even worse. \nThis.  He's waiting to hear. \nJULIANNE The E-mail?  You thought Walter sent your boss?  I wrote that. \nYou.  WHAT?!  Synapse overload. \nMICHAEL You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y... \nJULIANNE (stricken with remorse) ... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy. \nMICHAEL ARE YOU CRAZY? \nShe nods her head wildly, hair flopping. \nMICHAEL ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY INSANE?? \nMICHAEL Almost three. \nJULIANNE That is so romantic. \nWhich makes him reach and touch her hair. \nMICHAEL I just wonder if you know why. \nDo you? \nMICHAEL It's because romance isn't mystery, and tricks, and doubts, and halting, unspoken longings. That's not the real romance. \nTears in his eyes now.  First time. \nMICHAEL The real romance is saying yes. \nDoes she know that now?  He looks at his watch. \nMICHAEL (sighs) Woulda been a nice wedding. \nOh.  That. \nJULIANNE (urgently) You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love... \nJULIANNE Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock. (beat) You've got a lot of explaining to... \nMICHAEL I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over. \nJULIANNE That's little egotistical. \nHe glares at her. \nJULIANNE But, undoubtedly accurate. \nShe claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency. \nJULIANNE Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who... \nMICHAEL If you find her... \nStrange tone.  A gentle warning. \nMICHAEL The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain. (beat) Because the only fear she really has, is... \nJULIANNE ... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed. \nLooks at her own watch.  Shit! \nMICHAEL But if you do get to her first... \nShe looks up. \nMICHAEL There is something you are authorized to say. \nEXT.  TAXI STAND - DAY \nJulianne sits on the fender of this guy's taxi.  The driver smokes, paces, while she waits for a connection on her cellular.  Then... \nMANDY (V.O.) Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking. \nJULIANNE It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you? \nMANDY (V.O.) Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty. \nA shallow laugh... \nMANDY (V.O.) Or crying in her nachos, down at Comskey Park. \nJulianne's face SNAPS to alert. \nJULIANNE Ex-cuse me? \nMANDY (V.O.) I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding... \nJULIANNE You are so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh? \nSignals the driver, let's GO! \nJULIANNE I want to pick up a little something for the ceremony. \nINT.  LUXURY BOX, COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON \nGame in progress.  Julianne and the bodyguard stand in the doorway of the deserted skybox.  Everyone Walter knows is going to a wedding.  The box is empty except for one cardboard container of nachos, extra cheese, sitting alone before a pulled-back chair. \nBODYGUARD She wouldn't confide in me, so I called the house. \nHe sighs.  Feels terrible about all this. \nBODYGUARD Luckily, I got her cousin. \nJulianne nods.  Yeah, big break, there. \nJULIANNE Going to the john, she said? \nBODYGUARD Could be there awhile. \nINT.  WOMEN'S RESTROOM - AFTERNOON \nJulianne BURSTS into the enormous chaotic restroom.  Looks around wildly, no sign of Kim. \nJULIANNE YO!  IMMIGRATION! \nEverybody stops.  Pays attention. \nJULIANNE I GOT A WARRANT FOR MS. KIMBERLY WALLACE! \nJULIANNE ... he's never seen a woman before. \nPAN DOWN the white until we are... \nCLOSE on the bride's perfect slippers.  HOLD.  And... \nINT.  CHAPEL - EVENING \nBegins to slowly PAN BACK UP the length of an exquisite gown.  We can tell from the organ, the nearby thrum of expectant voices, that we are nearing the moment.  We reach... \n... Kimmy's hand.  Firmly clasping Walter's.  Keep PANNING, the bodice, the lace, her throat, and finally, we are CLOSE on... \n... the face of the bride.  Now we understand the word radiant.  We also understand scared senseless.  Our perfect, unflappable Kimmy is in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic seamlessly blend. \nThe organ's noddling stops.  Kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small animal bearing a predator approach her thicket.  Suddenly, the CHORD.  The Wedding March from Wagner's Lohengrin.  Here.  Comes. The bride.  And we SNAP TO... \nFULL ANGLE... Kim and Walter.  This is it. \nWALTER (whispers) Left foot. \nREVERSE ANGLE... Kim's POV, the chapel, every pew packed, every neck craning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to where... \nMichael waits.  Also in a zone of pseudo-consciousness.  From which he attempts a smile.  Not comforting.  Kim's POV WHIP PAN the groomsmen, the twins, LOCKING FOCUS on Julianne, standing strong and beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress.  She sends her little sister a WINK across the trackless miles of aisle.  You can do this, kid.  So... \n... Kimmy does.  On her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the world's intrusive admiration.  One step at a time.  The most beautiful she will ever be.  She is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw up at the same time. \nAnd she's there.  At his side.  She glances back to her maid of honor, just to make sure she's not working without a net.  So Julianne... \n... CROSSES her eyes.  Which lets the kid smile and finally take a breath.  Have a little fun, huh? Kim nods, got it, turns to... \nThe Minister.  Who stands before them with a calming presence. Thank God someone has done this before.  The crowd has hushed. The Minister's eyes are only for two.  His words are for all... \nMINISTER Michael and Kimmy wrote these words.  She asked me to confide, mostly Michael. \nA ripple of laughter.  Gentle and fine.  They are setting in. \nMINISTER So he gets to say them. \nA surprise.  A pleasant one.  The crowd adjust in its seats.  As Michael begins... \nMICHAEL Why do people get married anymore? \nAnd on these words.  We SNAP to Julianne.  Share her interest in the bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) Why not live together amicably, with no sense of obligation beyond the moment? \nHer eyes.  She's listening. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) As long as the sex is good.  As long as no one more interesting has wandered into view.  As long as the thousand conflicts of two individual wills remain comfortably compromised. \nPANNING now.  Other faces.  Isabelle.  Proud to the bone. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) And when one feels the urge to move on, to explore the new. No guilt, no disgrace, no promise broken. \nWalter.  His eyes damp.  Against our expectation. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) No agony of having dishonored a time.  When our hearts.  And the world were different. \nJoe nods, as he hears... \nMICHAEL (O.S.) Marriage is a lot to put up with. \nJulianne once more.  No breath.  Rapt. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) The answer must be.  That there is some need basic to the human heart.  That embracing... the obligation of commitment... fulfills. \nHer eyes have clouded.  As if Michael is talking to her. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) Some need to belong to one another in a way which rages against the notion... that all is impermanent. Against the notion of mortality. \nAnd suddenly, ALL the feeling rises in her throat. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) Our love is bigger.  And longer. Than life itself. \nAnd the tears come.  They come freely, unhidden, unnoticed.  As if they were needed. \nMichael now.  Looking at his bride. \nMICHAEL That's what we want.  And marriage. Is what we do about it. \nKimmy smiles at him.  With love bigger than life itself. \nMICHAEL We are fools in this.  Thank God Almighty. \nHe is done.  There is a silence. \nMINISTER Boy, that was good! \nPeople LAUGH.  The Minister holds up a sheet of paper.  For the crowd to see.  Mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink. \nMINISTER Michael and Kim also edited what they want me to say... \nMore laughter. \nMINISTER The idea was, we're only marrying once.  We have to remember it forever.  Let's keep to the good stuff. (squints at the sheet) You may kiss the bride. \nBigger LAUGHTER.  The Minister waves this off, his little joke. Turns to the best man, pantomimes the ring.  As the hammered gold circle is handed to Michael, Julianne absently scratches her still- swollen finger.  Mandy taps Julianne on the arm, and produces... \n... a matching ring.  Take it! Gives it to her.  So Julianne steps forward.  Places the second ring into Kimmy's waiting hand.  Their eyes meet, and hold throughout... \nMINISTER (O.S.) If anyone here can show just cause why this man and woman should not be married, speak now.  Or forever hold your peace. \nJulianne CLEARS her throat.  Kimmy's heart flutters.  In the silence... Julianne's wonderful smile.  Just kidding. \nMichael reaches for Kim's hand, turns her gently to him.  Places his ring on her finger.  Holds her hands. \n", "test1_input": "JAMS it in her mouth, brushing as... \nJULIANNE (mouthful) ... or even, maybe, their fax. \nStops.  The funniest look on her face.  Down to the toothpaste tube... \nWhich says BEN GAY. \nOh. \nINT.  TIFFANY'S - MORNING \nJulianne and Kimmy cruise the stately display cases.  Everywhere, the Tiffany logo, the silent, watchful staff in morning coats.  As they browse, Julianne takes a blueberry Danish from a paper sack, and begins to eat. \nThe staff notices.  So does Kim. \nJULIANNE It's an homage thing. \nHmm? \nJULIANNE Awkward girls grow up on Audrey Hepburn movies.  You wouldn't understand. \nKimmy doesn't.  But wipes a blue glob from Julianne's face. \nKIMMY Anyway, I think you're wrong. \nWrong? \nKIMMY What you were saying before. \nBefore? \nKIMMY About Michael's job. \nJULIANNE Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th... \nKIMMY I just think you're wrong, is all. \nJULIANNE Probably am.  Forget I brought it up. \nPoints to some jade pins.  Kimmy wrinkles her nose. \nKIMMY I mean, he loves his job. \nJULIANNE Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four... \nSmiles. \nJULIANNE What's not to love? \nNone of this is lost on Kimmy.  She's wondered the same. \nKIMMY But he always says... \nJULIANNE ... whatever is manly and independent. \nKim nods slowly.  Way ahead of her. \nJULIANNE Why would he trade that for running, say, a big piece of the PR at a powerful, complex, challenging conglomerate like your dad's? \nKim stares back.  A strange look. \nKIMMY That's just the sort of thing my father and I discussed. \nJulianne just blinks.  Amazed. \nJULIANNE I'm not stupid.  Say, how about this? \nPointing to tiny golden scissors in the novelty case.  Kim so absorbed by the main topic, she has to force herself to focus on... \nKIMMY For the twins? What in the world is th... \nJULIANNE Gold nose hair clippers. \nPoints to the tiny hand-lettered sign.  Indeed.  Kimmy shrugs, not quite it. \nKIMMY So you don't think Michael's as happy with his job as... \nJulianne points to a matched pair of large... \nKIMMY Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs. \nJULIANNE Hello. \nKim nods, oh.  But can't keep her mind off... \nKIMMY You think he'd accept? \nHmm? \nKIMMY Michael.  A job like that. \nOh, well... \nJULIANNE By any yardstick that involves sanity, it would be the greatest thing that ever happened to him. Present company excepted. \nKimmy nodding slowly.  Her yearing achingly apparent. \nJULIANNE On the other hand, he's proud. Last thing a man wants to admit, is being trapped in a dispiriting dead-end job that can never support a family. \nA very sweet smile. \nJULIANNE Throw a man a life preserver. He'll say, \"Thanks, anyway, I'd rather drown.\" \nKim nods again.  Right.  They are so bonded at this moment. \n", "test1_true": "JULIANNE Exactly. \nKIMMY Exactly what? \nJULIANNE What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor. \nKimmy bites her lip.  Her eyes go down.  Self-conscious to admit... \nJULIANNE I couldn't really... do that. After, you know... \nHer voice trails off. \nJULIANNE (kind, but wise) ... lying.  All the time. \nThat brings the gray eyes up.  Julianne bats her dark ones... \nJULIANNE Oh, darling, my pitiful desires and ambitions are dirt beneath the manly boots of your priorities! \nKimmy has to smile small.  A self-awe gal. \nJULIANNE (pouring it on) Two hundred seedy motels a year? Dinners out of vending machines? Waiting for you in vermin-infested corridors of dark crotch-rot locker rooms? This stuff makes me hot!! \nKIMMY The very words I've used. \nJulianne 'thinks it over.' Kimmy waits for guidance. \nJULIANNE We make Dad your co-conspirator. Michael does a favor for Walter. \nSimple. \nJULIANNE Walter's reorganizing his public relations, needs a brilliant guy who's close to him, who he can completely trust. \nKimmy nodding.  Hope overriding reason. \nJULIANNE So you beg.  Michael, please do this for Daddy, please, please, please, blah, blah, blah... it's only for six months...  it would mean so much to me to help him out... \nTurns up her palms.  Viola! \nKIMMY He'll see right through it. \nJULIANNE Only.  If he wants to. \nThey share a smile. \nJULIANNE In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful... \nKIMMY He won't get mad, huh? \nMR.  MOONEY (O.S.) May I be of any help, whatsoever? \nMr.  Mooney is the most gracious Brit salesperson ever to offer kindness, intelligence and thoughtfulness to a customer.  He is large, sixty, with disappearing hair, watering eyes, and a manner that makes you think of immediately hiring a butler. \nJULIANNE Bridesmaid gifts for two, well, assertive, outspoken, Tennessee debutantes. \nKIMMY (still focused) He won't be mad? \nJULIANNE (to Mooney) Nothing here seems to quite capture their distinctive personalities. \nMR.  MOONEY Something customized, perhaps? We can fashion most any item from gold. \nAh.  Julianne nodding.  Reflecting. \nMR.  MOONEY An object that might represent what is closest. To their heart. \nKIMMY (under her breath) Don't even think dildo. \nJulianne digs through her jumbled bag... \nJULIANNE Could you do this... \nTossing an object on the counter... \nJULIANNE In 24 carat? \nIt is a MASTERCARD.  A gold one. \nKIMMY (softly) Bingo. \nThey smile at each other.  More bonded than ever. \nKIMMY You don't think he'll be mad. \nA beat.  Can Julianne even make herself do this? \nJULIANNE Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap... \nKIMMY I just don't want to freak him out. \nWhat do you think? Julianne stares into the soft gray eyes.  It's now or never.  The smile of a dear sister... \nJULIANNE How mad could he get? \nINT.  FASHION RESTAURANT - LUNCH HOUR \nJulianne enters with a really nervous Kimberly in tow.  Approaches the maitre d'.  We CLOSE to hear... \nMAITRE D' Oh, Mr. Wallace and his guests have retired to the humidor. \nPoints to an escalator, leading to the mezzanine.  Behind a glass wall, what looks like a British men's club.  Thirty guys and a billion cigars.  As Julianne starts toward it... \nMAITRE D' Oh.  Mademoiselle. \nShe turns back.  Loves this shit. \n", "test2_input": "DIGGER Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away. \nSaid so naturally.  That embarrasses Michael, who looks down, his smile suddenly awkward. \nDIGGER What? \nMICHAEL I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective. \nSteals a glance at Julianne.  She rolls her eyes.  What a goofball, my outrageous friend. \nMICHAEL (to Digger) Stay, huh? \nDIGGER I honestly wish I could... \nMICHAEL I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me. \nJulianne comes over. \nJULIANNE (softly) They'd say that's my job. \nShe runs her hands over his jacket, smoothing it everywhere.  With tenderness that approaches transparency.  Glances back at Digger... \nJULIANNE I'll take it home from here. \nPinches Michael's ear.  Looks in his eyes. \nDIGGER Two words. \nJULIANNE Major.  Dish. \nDIGGER Manicure... \nShe looks down.  Michael's nails are unclipped, with layers of impacted dirt.  She touches his fingertips, a little more softly than she may have intended. \nDIGGER Fly. \nEveryone looks down.  She ZIPS Michael up. \nMICHAEL (to Digger) You don't miss much. \nDIGGER Part of being a New Yorker. \nINT.  HAIR SALON - MORNING \nCutting edge salon.  Loud, PULSING MUSIC.  Digger and Michael in adjacent chairs, heads back, each smoking impressive cigars as their hair is styled.  Digger's stylist is a hot trashy female. Michael's is a tall, flamboyant male in a day-glo vest. \nEach man has one hand soaking, the other being worked on by a manicurist, so Julianne goes from one to the other, removing their cigars so they can exhale.  A seraglio feel to the way she does this. \nNow she's arguing with Michael's stork-like stylist.  We can't hear over the music, but she keeps tugging on Michael's hair, pretty passionate about her point of view.  Suddenly, she GRABS the scissors to do it herself, and Michael... \n... BOLTS out of the chair.  WHOA! \nEXT.  O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY \nSkycaps, guests of impatient travelers, a bus offloading forty Japanese tourists.  A taxi cuts off a van to reach the curb.  Out jumps... \nMichael.  Opening the door for Digger and Julianne.  Digger says something, Michael gives him a strong HUG.  Julianne raises one finger to Michael, back in a second.  Leads Digger off by the hand. \nCLOSE on them now.  Alone in the throng. \nJULIANNE Bye, handsome. \nDigger just stares at her.  Those maddening judgemental eyes. \nJULIANNE You're going to say it, aren't you? \nDIGGER Tell him you love him.  With all your heart. \nJULIANNE I'm taking my next book to Viking. \nDIGGER Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it. \nJULIANNE I'm moving this book to Viking. \nDIGGER Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing. \nJULIANNE Needing. \nDIGGER To belong to someone. \nHe touches her hair. \nDIGGER We all do, beautiful.  I'm sorry about that. \nStaring in her eyes.  Even Julianne has run out of words. \nDIGGER Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose. \nJULIANNE And what will he do? \nDigger isn't smiling.  His voice low, beneath the crowd... \nDIGGER He'll choose Kim.  You'll stand by her at her wedding.  You'll kiss him good-bye.  And you'll go home. \nHe holds up one finger.  Almost touching her nose. \nDIGGER This is what you've come to do. Now do it. \nWow.  She looks frightened and moved, all at the same time.  She kisses him on the lips. \nAnd walks away.  He watches her go through the crowd.  Take Michael's hand.  Lead him back toward the taxi. \nEXT.  SKYLINE CRUISE BOAT - DAY \nThe skyline of Chicago moves past us.  Slowly.  The NBC Tower, Cityfront Center... \n", "test2_true": "JULIANNE (O.S.) You keep saying that. \nUp ahead, the Wrigley Building draws closer... \nMICHAEL (O.S.) Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her. \nJULIANNE (O.S.) Well, you've got the rest of your lives. \nREVERSE ANGLE... they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down the Chicago River.  Wind-blown.  Close together. \nJULIANNE Getting your bed made.  Every day. \nThey smile at each other.  Seem so comfortable together. \nJULIANNE You miss her, huh? \nMICHAEL No.  I've got you. \nShe nods.  That you have.  Staring in her eyes... \nMICHAEL Don't you throw up on boat? \nJULIANNE If you like. \nAnd she LURCHES over the railing, emitting a BARRAGE of incredibly disgusting sounds, her feet FLAILING in mid-air.  He laughs, as he pulls her back down to the deck.  Of course, it was all a joke.  He brushes back her hair.  Sighs.  Stares. \nMICHAEL I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually. \nJULIANNE (casual) Have you. \nHe has. \nJULIANNE Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from... \nMICHAEL It's more than that. \nThat tightens her throat pretty good.  When she tries to speak, out comes a dry CROAK that makes him laugh again.  Softer, this time. \nMICHAEL I mean, it's embarrassing to say it this way, but... \nHe stops.  Her eyes WIDEN in a burlesque of anticipation.  So he smiles.  She knows how to put him at ease. \nMICHAEL You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life. \nJULIANNE (straight back) You've been the man in mine. \nPassing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge.  No one knows quite what to say. \nMICHAEL And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know? \nJULIANNE Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year. \nMICHAEL Except for that. \nShe's smiling so easily.  Who would guess her stomach is double- knotted. \nMICHAEL I can hardly wait for your wedding. \nJULIANNE Me either. \nShe watches his surprise. \nMICHAEL Boy, I never thought I'd hear you say that.  Can I come? \nShe holds herself together.  Real soft with... \nJULIANNE I couldn't have it without you. \nHe's glad to hear that.  And then... \nMICHAEL It's normal to have... second thoughts, huh? To be scared. \nIs this a change of direction? Or is it the direction she's been praying for. \nJULIANNE I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts. \nMICHAEL I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it. \nShe nods.  Understands. \nMICHAEL You and I.  I mean, in all our relationships with other people... We didn't use the word \"love\" a lot, did we? \nWe didn't. \nMICHAEL Kimmy says.  When you love someone. You say it, you say it out loud. Right now.  Or the moment... \nLong beat. \nMICHAEL ... passes you by, yeah.  She's a smart girl. \nOff in distance, the Centennial Fountain SHOOTS an eight-foot JET of water across the river.  For Michael and Julianne it goes unnoticed. \nMICHAEL We don't have a song. \nHmm? \nMICHAEL Kimmy and I.  We don't have a song. Is that a bad sign? \nAll Julianne can do is shrug.  Then... \nMICHAEL (sings, softly) Someday, when I'm awfully low... And the world is cold... \nShe doesn't want to cry.  So she puts all the strength she has into fighting it back. \n", "test3_input": "Slips it on her left hand.  Ring finger. \nMANDY/SAMMY (O.S., singing) Comin too car-ryyy.

CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOSE on a bowl filled with squares of butter.  HEAR the butt of conversation from a rowdy, friendly joint.  Julianne's right hand REACHES to the bowl, fingers trace the rim innocently, then... \n... SLIDE the bowl into Julianne's lap beneath the table.  Her right hand MASSAGES all the butter into a gooey revolving mess.  We can pick out familiar voices now, family in distance, the twins closer. As, hidden from view, Julianne brings... \n... her left hand from her pocket.  Yep.  The ring is still there. The finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it off.  And as APPLAUSE surrounds us, Julianne... \nPLUNGES her ring finger into the morass of grease, frantically TEARING at the ring, butter SPLURGING on her pants, everywhere, as we PULL BACK to see... \n... the long table covered with butcher paper, the family at the far end, the twins down here with us, a mug of beer for each place, as team of waiters with heaping platters of CRABS, which they... \n... FLING across the butcher paper, as APPLAUSE continues from everyone but Julianne, who still struggles secretly.  As the waiters set huge wooden MALLETS in front of each guest, Joe O'Neal rises, POUNDS the table with his mallet for attention. \nJOE Like to welcome ever'body to our little rehearsal supper... \nHe COUGHS, unaccustomed to public speaking.  Walter and Isabelle clap and call out support.  So Joe lifts his mallet... \nJOE Okay, everyone stand up! \nAnd everyone does.  With one exception.  Trapped.  She JAMS her left hand in her coat pocket, SMEARS her right palm sort of clean on the underside of the table, GRABS her mallet and JUMPS UP. \nJOE To the bride, uh, goes the honor... of cracking the first crab! \nEveryone applauses by banging their mallets.  Joe RAISES his high. Everybody imitates. \nKIMMY But first, a toast! \nAnd everybody SNATCHES up their beers with their left hands, as Julianne DROPS her mallet with a HORRIFIC CRASH, grabbing her beer, looking up to... \nJULIANNE (on the spot) I'm right-handed. \nA hugely embarrassing half-second.  Bailed out by... \nKIMMY To our host, my cuddly Papa Joe. \nAll turns. \nKIMMY Who taught me to play \"Blue Hawaii.\" On my nose. \nWith a look at Julianne, Kim sets down her mallet gently, and performs a nasal HUM of the tropical standard, strikingly her nostril repeatedly for vibrato.  It is charming, and everybody watches. \nINT.  HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER \nCLOSE on an actual, living, if geriatric, LION.  He blinks from his cage, bored as hell.  HEAR the surrounding noise, chatter, LOUD Sinatra music, of a very large party.  PULL BACK to see... \n... and overdecorated BALLROOM, in dim and dramatic lighting, dripping with the trappings of ANCIENT ROME.  The mingling guests are the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party, most of them older women.  They are served by wandering well-built ATHLETES in Roman togas or gladiator costumes.  PAN TO... \n...  Julianne, still in her suit, hiding by a table piled with a carload of grapes.  Her left hand still buried in her pocket.  The eyes of a hunted animal.  From nowhere... \nMANDY/SAMMY (O.S.) Boo!!! \nShe JUMPS a foot, both hands FLYING UP, left one awkwardly slamming back into its pocket.  The girls have snuck up behind her.  They have changed into hot gowns that are really only wide ribbons wrapped around their bodies. \nMANDY I know why you're scared of our party.  It's too hip. \nSinatra singing \"Stranger In The Night.\" Hugely-muscled, half-naked black and white studs, serving enchanted blue-haired ladies. \nSAMMY Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches... \nSAMMY (points out the jokes) Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter... \nMANDY ... I'm partial to the tight end. \nSAMMY This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted... \nNow they stare at her.  With identical, really odd, smiles. \nSAMMY And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive. \nMANDY With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret. \nOh. \nJULIANNE Well, I'm worried about something. \nSomething.  Their expressions are deliciously, identically expectant. \nJULIANNE Oh.  I left this really important file in Walter's office.  I have to send my editor some... \nSome... \nJULIANNE ... figures.  On territorial sales. To close my book deal. \nUh-huh... \nJULIANNE So Kim gave me the key.  And Michael's on his way, to drive me down to Wal... \nSAMMY Oh.  We thought it was the ring. \nJulianne blinks.  Ring...? \n", "test3_true": "Ah.  That ring. \nJULIANNE Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would... \nMANDY (helpful) ... look good on Kimberly. \nJULIANNE Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly. \nSAMMY Maybe it's happy there. \nMANDY Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring? \nSAMMY He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you. \nMANDY An so it is. \nJulianne for once is speechless.  To our amazement, the girls wear identical smiles of kindness and support. \nMANDY Shut up, sugar, he's on his way. Let's get to work. \nINT.  HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHuge gleaming chaotic kitchen.  Cooks, waiters, working at top speed.  The three women RACE in, look around frantically, half the guys stop to ogle the twins.  CUT TO... \nANGLES... and industrial-sized jar of peanut butter.  Julianne's hand PLUNGES in, halfway to the rolled-up sleeve at her elbow.  SMOOCHES it around, real good.  PULL BACK to reveal... \n... she is surrounded by the twins and six guys, all SHOUTING conflicting instructions.  Julianne FLINGS off the excess SLOP. Tugs for all she's worth... \nEIGHT PEOPLE TWIST IT!  TWIST IT! \nNada.  It won't budge.  A sous chef WIPES her hand with a towel, a janitor CRASHES a tool kit onto the counter.  THROWS it open, pulls out... \n... a spray can of WD-40.  Instantly, her hand is BLACK.  The guy TUGS. No movement.  He can't believe it. \nJANITOR It's mental, lady, you ain't trying! \nSammy is rummaging through her handbag, pulling out... \nSAMMY There is nothing so tight, this can't help it... \n... a tube of jelly.  The letter K-Y.  Julianne just gives her a look. Mandy pushes through with a butcher's CLEAVER... \nMANDY I saw this on Hard Copy.  People cut off body parts and the hospital sew 'em back o... \nThe look has turned toward her. \nJULIANNE (cold) I saw the show. \nMANDY ... well, maybe it works on fingers, too. \nFLOWER GIRL (O.S.) Aunt Mandy...? \nEverybody turns.  The little girl in the doorway.  Southern accent... \nFLOWER GIRL Mr.  Michael's here. \nEverything gets real quiet.  Mandy takes charge.  She rolls down Julianne's left sleeve, RIPS the hem out of the cuff, so that it flaps down over her hand, covering the ring.  Sammy wipes the black stuff from Julianne's fingers. \nMANDY Don't worry, baby.  You could pick your nose with that finger and Michael would never notice. He's a man. \nThe twins lead her off.  We're on their backs for... \nMANDY (O.S.) Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl. \nSAMMY (O.S.) You're much more his type. \nEXT.  DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT \nVIEW through a heavy glass door of the empty, dimly-lit lobby. PULL BACK to see Julianne, just as she... \n... KICKS the shit out of the glass! Almost breaks her foot. \nJULIANNE I can't believe this! \nPULL BACK farther to see Michael still trying keys from a large key ring in the heavy lock.  Sign over the door says WALLACE ENTERPRISES. Traffic hustles by, oblivious to her suffering. \nMICHAEL It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s... \nJULIANNE ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH... \nAnd she SLAMS her whole BODY against the glass, making it rattle ominously. \nJULIANNE WHERE'S A BRICK?  FIND ME A GODDAMN BRICK!! \nShe looks around wildly, hysterical. \nMICHAEL What is the big deal about getting this file tonight? \nA good question.  She needs a good answer. \nJULIANNE I promised Digger I'd E-mail him those figures. \nFrom his face, that wasn't it. \nJULIANNE They are very important figures. \nApparently.  He's just staring at her. \nJULIANNE I'm up against a deadline. \nMICHAEL Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow. \nJULIANNE That's my point!! \n"}

{"test1_input": "A slender black woman sings a SOARING Gospel number, backed by three ladies who could each solo in any church choir.  It is mesmerizing, stirring, transcendent.  The unseen audience CLAPPING FIERCELY in rhythm, SHOUTING support.  SLOW PAN now... \n... every face is black.  We aren't in church at all, but a venerable blue club.  One of those places you'd swear everybody's played, from Robert Johnson to Bessie Smith and back again.  As the song ends, there is APPLAUSE, some RAPPING on tables with their knuckles or their drunks.  We keep PANNING to a far corner.  Three faces. \nJulianne leans across her beer to Kimmy... \nJULIANNE How'd you find this pl... \nKim shaking her head.  Looks admiringly to Michael... \nKIMMY Lived here my whole life, never heard of it.  Until our first date. \nShe reaches slender fingers.  Traces one back along his hair. \nKIMMY He finds all these spots, everywhere he goes, it's a mystical gift. \nMICHAEL (shy) Jesus, one d-back from the Bears knows a place... \nKIMMY It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the... \nJULIANNE ... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff... \nKIMMY Stop, we're embarrassing h... \nJULIANNE ... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes... \nMICHAEL I tried those on.  When you weren't looking. \nNow he's grinning at Julianne.  And she likes that a lot. \nJULIANNE Where was that, Florence, huh? \nMICHAEL Firenze. \nTogether in the memory.  As Kimmy watches. \nJULIANNE The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night? \nMICHAEL Till the gas ran out. \nAnd, the first sniff of left-out... \nKIMMY I love Florence. \nJulianne's eyes flicker.  Could this be a teensy opening? Keeps her eyes, her easy smile, and her killer instincts trained on Michael. \nJULIANNE Take her there. \nHe nods, okay. \nJULIANNE I mean, now.  She's perky, she deserves a honeymoon. \nHe draws a breath... \nJULIANNE I heard.  If San Antone sweeps Sacramento.  What is this shit? You gotta get off the road by September anyway, when does Fall Quarter start? \nAnd the happy couple look at each other.  They are awkward. Julianne's heart soar like eagle. \nKIMMY Uh.  I'm not coming back.  For senior year. \nCould this be.  The Mother Lode? \nJULIANNE Don't architects find a degree, sort of... an asset? \nThe couple still staring in each other's eyes. \nKIMMY Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now... \nMICHAEL I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps... \nKIMMY The most important thing. Is being together. \nAnd she smiles.  Beautifully. \nKIMMY I'm just a baby.  I've got all... the time... in the world. \nEXT.  CLUB - NIGHT \nMichael putting Kim in the back of a cab.  As Julianne watches. \nMICHAEL Because I could come... \nKIMMY To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...? \nJULIANNE (calls out, helpful) They're gonna drool anyway! \nKim smiles.  He kisses her, tenderly, through the open window.  She waves past him at Julianne. \nKIMMY (to both) Enjoy each other. \nAnd drives off.  As he watches after, Julianne comes up behind him. Slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle.  Starts giving a little massage. \nJULIANNE Should I whistle down a cab? \nMICHAEL Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember? \nTurns his head, to see her.  She's still rubbing his shoulder. \nJULIANNE Sometimes.  About the dumbest things. \nShare a smile.  As always, it covers a lot of years. \nMICHAEL The El's right down the street. Unless you're afraid of the neighborhood. \nShe looks around.  It is an issue.  But she remembers... \n", "test1_true": "She means that.  He takes her by the hand.  They begin walking... \nJULIANNE Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice. \nMICHAEL What, leaving school... \nJULIANNE ... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers... \nMICHAEL (quietly) In her way. \nJULIANNE All to follow you in this dumb job, where you travel 52 weeks a year to College Station, Texas, and such.  It's not a job for a grown man, Michael, Peter Pan never married. \nHe's let go of her hand now.  Looking down at the pavement before him, fists in his jacket pockets. \nJULIANNE (softly) I don't think she's naturally the... submissive type.  Aren't you afraid she's gonna choke on this stand-by-your-man shit after awhi... \nMICHAEL (real quiet) No. \nHit a nerve.  This is promising. \nJULIANNE I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t... \nMICHAEL She would never.  Never.  Even think of that. \nPaydirt.  Julianne's Geiger Counter is going berserk. \nJULIANNE I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula... \nMICHAEL I got the point. \nHe looks over at her.  No smile on his face.  An edge we haven't seen.  She shrugs... \nJULIANNE Still.  All's fair in love and w... \nMICHAEL That would be a girl.  I don't even know. \nThey've reached the stairs to the El.  A rickety train RATTLES above them.  As they start up, she slips her arm around his waist... \nJULIANNE (murmurs) Forgive me, okay? I was talkin' crazy. \nHe slides his arm around her shoulder.  Pals.  They climb out of frame. \nINT.  HOTEL BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT \nCLOSE on a shallow pool of water in a bathroom sink.  Green powder pouring in, a hand SWIRLING it around, until... \nJULIANNE (O.S.) It's Albanian, I think.  Or Mongolian. Or Canadian.  One of those.  I bought it downstairs... \n... it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud. \nJULIANNE (O.S.) I figure, what the hell.  Can it make me look worse? \nFollow the hand up as it SLATHERS the shit across her face in great green dripping gobs.  She's juggling the wall phone, trying to keep it mudless, as she assures Digger... \nJULIANNE Dig, of course.  Of course, of course, of course, of course I have a plan.  Certainment! \nMore green slime.  The Julianne we know disappears. \nJULIANNE How? I ask myself, what would Lucy Ricardo do in this situa... \nDesecrates three hotel towels, wiping her hand. \nJULIANNE Well, one worked, once. \nTHROWS them in the bathtub.  Fastidiousness a short suit. \nJULIANNE Ricky wouldn't let her in the show. \nReaches for her toothbrush, absently.  All her attention is on the conversation and the hideous green face in the mirror. \nJULIANNE I recall it differently, but we digress. \nWithout looking, picks up a tube of hotel shampoo... \nJULIANNE So in the version, you're Ethel, with better fashion instincts. \nSqueezes it all over the toothbrush. \nJULIANNE This puts you in charge of Plan B, the unprincipled and insanely dangerous back-up plan... \nLifts it toward her mouth, liquid shampoo dripping from the bristles. \nJULIANNE In case simple lying doesn't work. \nAt the last second.  She stops.  We don't know why, because she's still never looked at the brush. \nJULIANNE Question.  What happens if you brush your teeth with shampoo? \nTurns on the tap.  Tries to scrub the toothbrush clean, and DROPS the phone into the green swamp, which SPATTERS all over her front. Euucch.  She's stymied, agitated, circling the sink, leaning down to it... \nJULIANNE HOLD ON.  I'M COMING IN FOR YOU! \nShe sets the toothbrush down in her toiletries kit.  Decides to YANK on the phone's cord, and the receiver SPRINGS out, BOPPING her in the face.  She's so filthy at this point, she just wipes it clean on her nightshirt.  Tells Digger... \nJULIANNE You okay? This is one of those problem phones. \nLifts the toothbrush and tube of paste from her kit. \nJULIANNE Right.  Your role.  You know guys from Sports Illustrated, yes? I mean, you can walk right in there... \nSqueezes on the paste, lifts the brush to her mouth... \nJULIANNE You could get access to letterhead, for example. \n", "test1_id": 1329, "test2_input": "MICHAEL (sings) I will feel a glow just Thinking of you... And the way you look.  Tonight. \nHe stops.  Smiles that sweet, boyish smile. \nMICHAEL Dance card filled? \nJULIANNE I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days. \nHe holds up his arms.  And she moves into them.  He begins to dance with her, turning so slowly.  And, yes, people are watching. \nMICHAEL (sings in her ear) With each word, your tenderness grows, Tearing my fears apart... \nShe holds him closer.  Bites her lip. \nMICHAEL (sings) And that laugh That wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart. \nHe stops.  He looks at her.  She's still in his arms. \nMICHAEL Where did we first hear th... \nJULIANNE (straight back) The night we met. \nRight to his eyes... \nJULIANNE The night we fell in love. \nHe doesn't know what to do with that. \nMICHAEL So we heard it... like, right that... that first... \nJULIANNE We danced to it.  Just like this. \nJust like this.  A long beat.  And he has to say... \nMICHAEL I won't lose you, will I? \nHer eyes close.  Then open.  Utterly lost in his. \nJULIANNE No.  Because I won't let you. \nINT.  WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY \nJulianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress shirt.  Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through the Saturday-deserted office space.  Desks, cubicles, monitors, silent.  A row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for the custodian.  Turning a corner, we hear... \n... life, at the end of the hallway.  A grand conference room with a glass wall.  Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting for five.  DEIDRE, his personal secretary, clicking every word into her laptop at warp speed.  Walter sees Julianne through the glass. A comic take of pleased surprise.  He comes out to greet her... \nWALTER I thought Michael was picking me up. \nJULIANNE I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials. \nMeaning, you.  They smile at each other.  Then... \nWALTER Kim said, when he turned down the job, there was no friction. \nJulianne thinks back. \nJULIANNE Friction.  No. \nHe smiles at her line reading.  But his mind is always probing. \nWALTER I haven't caused... a problem, have I? \nJULIANNE Nobody has.  So far. \nHer bright grin.  His eyes linger on it. \nWALTER Well, you're a little early... \nJULIANNE I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office? \nINT.  WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY \nJulianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city. Closes the door, quietly, behind her.  So anxious, she is practically hyperventilating.  She goes, slowly to the vacant cherrywood desk.  Its computer and monitor standing silent.  She is stalking it, like a deadly animal.  And then.  She is there. \nTalking to herself, her own desperate support network... \nJULIANNE (softly) You can do this. \nSacred, filled with doubt and conflict.  Her hands clutch at each other.  Then, one flicks out.  And the computer goes ON.  The screen GLOWS.  Waits for her.  Her mouth is sand, her stomach water.  She pulls the paper from her pocket... \n... looks at it.  Looks to the monitor.  And begins.  To type... \nJULIANNE (mumbling to herself) E-mail address.  To Ben Isaacson, Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated, from... Walter Wallace. \nAnd stops.  Her heart is thumping. \nJULIANNE See, you can do it.  It's easy. \nDoesn't look easy.  Licks her lips. \nJULIANNE You do it fast, it's over.  Like it never happened. \nShe sits.  And recites as she types... \nJULIANNE Ben.  I need a favor. \nHere we go.  This is it.  Types... \nJULIANNE My daughter's every happiness. And my wife's.  And, least of all, my own, are in your hands. \nNods, okay.  Breathing hard.  Types... \nJULIANNE Knowing you value our friendship, and the... cooperative relationship between our companies... I am hopeful of your help. \nTouch, that.  Thinks.  It has to be.  Types... \n", "test2_true": "Almost there.  Almost.  Types... \nJULIANNE To his own detriment, as well as ours, Michael will not accept our offer.  While he works for you. \nShe stands up.  Stares at the screen.  Walks away.  Walks back. Still standing, types... \nJULIANNE My daughter joins me in this plea for your cooperation and discretion. \nIs there a SOUND?  Outside the door.  She HOVERS over the ESCAPE key.  Waits.  Waits.  Silence.  Types... \nJULIANNE With gratitude.  For your understanding.  Walter. \nShe hits a KEY.  The screen goes BLANK.  The computer asks... DO YOU WISH TO SEND?  She tells the computer... \nJULIANNE Are you crazy?  Get him fired? \nTypes NO.  The computer asks HOLD FOR LATER? And she types YES. \nJULIANNE Just till tonight when I bring him back.  To look for... \nShe glances to her huge bag.  Rummages through, pulling out a manila folder.  Lays it by the blank computer.  Fans out a few pages in a natural, disorderly way.  Takes a step back... \nAnd stares.  Struck to her gut.  But when she has done. \nINT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nWalter alone with Deidre now, signing a stack of documents, as she efficiently places one after another before him.  When he glances up, he sees Julianne wandering the halls.  Stands, tells his secretary... \nWALTER (going through stack) Off to rehearsal.  Send out this, and this, not this, this, and... that's it. \nSlips on his coat.  Oh... and by the way... \nWALTER I'm holding four or five E-mails I wrote over lunch... \nOn his way through the door... \nWALTER Send 'em out. \nINT.  CHAPEL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - DAY \nJulianne and Walter enter the rear of a striking Gothic CHAPEL, pastel light slanting in through stained glass windows.  We now see the full effect of her outfit, a man's-style chalk stripe SUIT, tailored to fit her body, set off by a bold silk tie.  Solid dynamite.  She hangs back, while Walter proceeds down the vaulted nave toward... \n... Michael, Kimmy, Isabelle and Joe, who stand casually joking by the altar.  Scattered around are assorted groomsmen, ushers, an obvious flowergirl.  Coming toward us, up the aisle... \n... the MINISTER, early 40s, lean and quite attractive.  Mandy is HANGING on his arm, pressing her body against him as they walk, murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear.  He's a really good sport, and really uncomfortable.  Sammy is walking backwards, right in front of them, DROPS her bag, and BENDS to retrieve it, as if oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display. \nJulianne is so lost in her own anxiety, she doesn't even notice, until... \nMANDY Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor... \nSAMMY ... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen. \nToday, the girls' voices are charmingly musically Southern, with none of the extreme accents we heard at the shower.  The minister extends his hand... \nMINISTER Billy Dyer, Julianne.  And I love the suit. \nShe shakes his hand, smiles graciously, but her eyes flick to Michael, now approaching up the aisle.  The girls lead the minister away.  Michael arrives.  Looks her up and down. \nMICHAEL (softly) Takes me back. \nJULIANNE Well. \nShe smiles.  One that glows a little. \nJULIANNE You sang the song.  Least I could do was wear the outfit. \nHe nods. \nMICHAEL Except now you're better- looking. \nOh, yeah?  Yes, ma'am.  As she loses herself in his eyes... \nMICHAEL I got the ring. \nHe pulls the box from his pocket.  Somewhere, an ORGAN sounds.  And as he is about to hand her the box... \nMANDY/SAMMY (sing) Swi-i-ng low-ow-ow... Wee-ee-eet Char-i-ot... \nSuch exquisite two-part harmony, Michael stops to watch. \nMANDY/SAMMY (sing) Comin', to car-ryyy Me ho-o-o-me... \nIt is amazing.  Soulful vengeful sluts.  He is enthralled.  Julianne simply impatient.  She wants his attention. \nJULIANNE No accents today. \nMICHAEL Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard. \nShe takes the box from his hand.  Opens it, as the singing CONTINUES throughout.  The ring is delicate hammered gold.  One of a kind. \nMICHAEL Will she like it? \nJULIANNE (whisper) Yes. \nShe's staring at the ring. \nKIMMY (O.S.) My groom-person!  Your family needs you! \nHis master's voice.  He gives Julianne a smile.  And goes.  She's left with the box. \nGazes at the ring.  Lifts it out. \nMANDY/SAMMY (O.S., singing) Well, I look over yon-der, And what did I see-ee-ee? \n", "test2_id": 1330, "test3_input": "... Michael is racing for the cars.  Julianne, sprinting her guts out, losing ground with every stride.  Michael JUMPS into a Cherokee... \nJULIANNE MICHAEL, DON'T, YOU'LL NEVER CATCH HER!! \nHe GRINDS the gears.  She keeps RUNNING.  His engine FIRES. \nJULIANNE SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!! \nHe BLASTS OFF.  She keeps going.  Gasping for air, clutching her side, she's dying here.  Slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit! Next, a butcher's van, looks inside, Jesus! \nJULIANNE (to the world at large) DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS ANYMORE?  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO TRUST?? \nUp ahead, Michael has STALLED the Cherokee.  She still has a chance, DASHES to the next van.  BORNSTEIN EXTERMINATION, a handsome rendering of a rat above the TOXIC MATERIALS warning FLINGS the door open.  Stumbles in.  Keys! \nJULIANNE (O.S.) THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!! \nMichael SPEEDS away.  She KICKS the ratmobile in gear. \nLURCHES off. \nINT.  RATMOBILE, DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - DAY \nJulianne tearing through traffic, desperately struggling to keep Michael's Cherokee in view, while she shrieks into her cellular... \nJULIANNE IT IS NOT GOING WELL! \nDown the block, Michael WHIPS around a corner.  We follow suit to see his destination dead ahead.  Union Station.  The DISPATCHER RADIO intrudes... \nDISPATCHER (O.S.) Uh, Unit Four Baker Charlie, how we cookin' on that Skokiie infestation? \nNow she's steering the car, tearing at the radio controls, and screaming into the phone cradled on her shoulder... \nJULIANNE THIS IS WHAT COMES OF TELLING THE TRUTH! \nFIELD MAN (O.S.) Copy, dispatcher... \nJULIANNE OR EVEN PART OF IT! \nFIELD MAN (O.S.) Uh, what happens if you got that methyl-ethyl shit on your hands? \nMichael RIPS into the train station's parking lot.  We SWERVE around a taxi, CUT OFF Harley, CAREEN into the lot... \nJULIANNE GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE IS NOT FAIR! \nDISPATCHER (O.S.) Uh, you got maybe thirty seconds before you're sterile.  For God's sake don't touch yourself, or anything. \nUp ahead, Michael is OUT of his jeep and running. \nJULIANNE AND I HATE TALKING TO YOUR MACHINE! \nShe SLAMS on the brakes, THROWING herself against the wheel. \nYOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.) Uh, this is One Monkey Zebra. It wasn't bees in the gal's wall, it was cats! \nShe TEARS the door open.  SCRAMBLE OUT... \nYOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.) She says gas 'em, anyway, she'll pay cash.  Uh... how do I pay this? \nWITH Julianne now, RACING through the lot, Michael vanishes INTO the Station, she PLUNGES in after him, BOUNCING off bystanders, apologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion, threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk, catching a lucky glimpse as he heads... \n... DOWN a staircase to the TRACKS.  My God, what's he doing?  A second wind, fueled by panic, and she BOLTS after him, DANCING down the steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the concourse to see him, running for... \n... Track 29, a train already RUMBLING, ready to pull out, she SPRINTS after him. \nJULIANNE MICHAEL!! \nHe DISAPPEARS behind the train, she FALLS, skids, springs up, pushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train PULLS AWAY... \nJULIANNE NNNOOOO!!! \nBut he's just standing there.  His back to us.  Watching it go. \nHer body nearly collapses with relief.  She pushes herself on, but her legs aren't working right in their maxed-out fatigue, and she lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him.  He's still lost in thought, staring after the train. \nShe tries to speak, but there's no breath.  So she puts her hands on her knees and just GASPS for air like a dog.  Wheezing, panting, trying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually turns and... \n... JUMPS out of his skin!  A heart attack seeing her. \nJULIANNE (croaks) Don't speak! \nHe just blinks at this sweaty, ripped-up, maniacal figure. \nMICHAEL Uh.  I saw that moving... \nJULIANNE DON'T SPEAK! \nFLINGING both her hands across his mouth.  A frozen beat.  He nods, okay.  Cautiously, she takes her hands away.  At least she has made him smile, in spite of everything.  At least she's done that. \nJULIANNE I have to make a confession. Another confession.  Besides that I love you.  This is even worse. \nThis.  He's waiting to hear. \nJULIANNE The E-mail?  You thought Walter sent your boss?  I wrote that. \nYou.  WHAT?!  Synapse overload. \nMICHAEL You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y... \nJULIANNE (stricken with remorse) ... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy. \nMICHAEL ARE YOU CRAZY? \nShe nods her head wildly, hair flopping. \nMICHAEL ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY INSANE?? \n", "test3_true": "MICHAEL ARE YOU ON DRUGS??? \nShakes her head, like a two-year-old. \nMICHAEL (pacing in circles) I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that? \nJULIANNE I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and... \nAnd watching.  As this begins to sink in. \nJULIANNE I've done nothing but slimy, underhanded, despicable, not even terribly imaginative, things.  Ever since I got here.  Trying to... \nStaring in his eyes.  Eyes she can't read at this point. \nJULIANNE ... to win you.  To win you back. \nTears in her own eyes now.  Big ones. \nJULIANNE And I was blinded by love. Like you said. \nShaking her head... \nJULIANNE But that doesn't excuse any part of it.  I am pond scum. \nNo... \nJULIANNE Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung... \nMICHAEL Lower. \nJULIANNE (agreeing) Lower. \nMICHAEL The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus. \nAnd to her amazement.  The trace of a smile... \nMICHAEL (softly) On the other hand, thank you. \nShe blinks at that.  Which squeezes out a tear. \nMICHAEL For loving me that much, that way. \nHe shrugs.  Just above a whisper... \nMICHEL It's pretty flattering. \nJULIANNE Except it makes me fungus. \nMICHAEL Well, that part I knew. \nShe's never loved him more. \nJULIANNE So you have to marry Kim. Because she will actually make you happy.  I, in contrast, am a shallow, neurotic psychopath, with relatively little to offer. \nOkay? \nJULIANNE Kim.  Nod your head.  Do as you're told. \nHe nods his head, still smiling.  Her tears are running now.  Maybe she doesn't notice. \nJULIANNE Just promise you'll never tell me who you would have chosen. If I hadn't confessed. \nShe chokes back a sob. \nJULIANNE Cos if you would have chosen me. Then I threw away a perfectly good life.  Just to be a decent person.  Which is a questionable trade-off.  Right? \nHe nods, slowly.  Because he's supposed to. \nJULIANNE And if you would have chosen some 20-year-old punk over me. I'd have to kill myself. \nAh.  His smile keeps getting smaller.  More loving.  More wonderful. \nMICHAEL (whispers) I'll take it to my grave. \nGood.  She looks around. \nJULIANNE I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before... \nMICHAEL I came here, looking for her. \nFor her.  The words leave a silence. \nJULIANNE Why would she come here... \nMICHAEL This is where I proposed. \nStares deep in her eyes.  She needs to hear this. \nMICHAEL I had to cover a game in Milwaukee.  She saw me off. And when the train started to leave... I jumped up on the step, I help the handle, and without... \nHe grins.  Has to admit... \nMICHAEL ... without a thought in my head. I shouted, \"Marry me.\" \nI did.  Now her eyes tear up again.  And she doesn't know why. \nMICHAEL And she gasped, and covered her mouth, and the train was pulling out, and suddenly she screamed YES!  Just once.  And blew me a kiss. \nWhat a girl. \nMICHAEL I never forgot that. \nJULIANNE It's two weeks. \n", "test3_id": 1331}

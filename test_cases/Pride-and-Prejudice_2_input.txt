ELIZABETH Your Ladyship declared it to be impossible. 
LADY CATHERINE Let me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say? 
ELIZABETH Only this - if that is the case you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me. 
LADY CATHERINE Oh obstinate girl! This union has been planned since their infancy. Do you think it can be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to his family? Whose own sister's elopement resulted in the scandalously patched-up marriage, only achieved at the expense of your uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him? 
ELIZABETH I am not. 
LADY CATHERINE And will you promise never to enter into such an engagement? 
ELIZABETH I will not. And I certainly never shall. Allow me to say, the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have, insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say. I must ask you to leave immediately. Good night. Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family outside. 
LADY CATHERINE I have never been thus treated in my entire life. Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement of having stood so firmly up for herself. 
MR BENNET Lizzie, what on earth is going on? 
ELIZABETH Just a small misunderstanding. She walks past them to bed. 
MRS BENNET Lizzie! 
ELIZABETH For once in your life. Just leave me alone. Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction. 
126 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 126 
Jane is fast asleep. Elizabeth unable to sleep. She quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room. 
127 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 127 
Elizabeth sits alone downstairs, thinking. Outside we see dawn is breaking. 
128 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAWN. 128 
Elizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around through the early morning mist, as the sun starts to rise. 
129 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE OVERLOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 129 
Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy. 
ELIZABETH Mr Darcy! 
DARCY What are you doing out here so early? 
ELIZABETH I could not sleep. 
DARCY Me neither. I have been up.most of the night. 
Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy. 
ELIZABETH Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your unexampled generosity to both my sisters. I know what kindnesses you have done for poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the happy resolution for Jane also. 
DARCY I am alarmed that you know of what I have been so in earnest to keep silent. But you must know that your happiness was one of my prime inducements. Elizabeth looks at Darcy. 
DARCY (CONT`D) I know you are too generous to trifle with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt last night, and it has taught me to hope as I had scarcely allowed myself before. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but 
one word from you will silence me forever. 
Elizabeth is silent. 
DARCY (CONT'D) If, however, your feelings have changed... Elizabeth gazes at him. 
DARCY (CONT'D) I would have to tell you, you have bewitched me body and soul and I love and love and love you. And never wish to be parted from you from this day on. Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's cheek. 
ELIZABETH I am very happy to inform you that not only have my sentiments changed there are no other words which could give me greater pleasure. Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very, very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the kiss becomes passionate. 
130 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DUSK. 130 
The place is in an uproar. Bingley, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Mr and Mrs Bennet are all gathered, fretting terribly about Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts. 
MRS BENNET Lizzie, where have you been. We thought something had happened to you. Darcy follows Elizabeth in. 
MRS BENNET (CONT'D) Mr Darcy! What on earth are you doing here? Elizabeth takes Mr Darcy's hand. 
ELIZABETH Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa. Everyone is stunned.

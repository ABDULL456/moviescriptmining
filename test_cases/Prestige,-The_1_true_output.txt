ANGIER How can be not know?! 
Angier FLINGS Borden's journal across the room. 
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D) He must know what he did. He must. 
INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY 
Borden smiles as he reads Angier's dairy. 
BORDEN "How can be not know?!" 
(STARTS LAUHING) Because, Angier, life is complicated, people are complicated, knots are 
COMPLICATED- 
PRISONER (O.S.) Shit it, Professor, or I'll shut it for you. 
Borden quiets. Looking at the journal. 
BORDEN (V.O.) How could I not know? How can you read my story and not understand? 
INT. COURTROOM -- DAY 
Cutter sits in the CROWDED GALLERY. Borden, in the dock, SCANS the crowd. Finally SPOTS Fallon pushing to the front- he is alone. Borden stares at him. Fallon shakes his dead. 
Borden is prompted to stand by two GUARDS as the Judge enters. The JUDGE has a piece of black cloth draped over his wig. 
JUDGE Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier. You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul. 
Borden barely reacts. 
EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY 
Borden stands at the fence with Fallon 
BORDEN They took her away? 
(FALLON NODS) To the workhouse? 
Another slow nod. Borden closes his eyes with despair. Then opens them and hands Fallon OWENS' CARD. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Tell him I've reconsidered. 
(OFF LOOK) It's for the best. 
INT. DINING ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN, COLORADO SPRING -- DUSK 
Angier stares down at the NOTEBOOK, making notes on a napkin. Through large windows a THUNDERSTORM batters Pike's Peak. Angier is the only guest in the hotel's massive dining room. 
VOICE (O.S.) Mind if I join you? 
Angier looks around. Alley is standing by the table. 
ALLEY Tesla sends me down here during the storms. Perfect excuse to come shere a drink with the Great Danton. 
Alley sits, gesturing to a waiter. 
ALLEY (CONT'D) Have you tried our Bourbon yet, Mr. Angier? It matches the scenery nicely. 
(TO WAITER) Two of 'em. 
(TO ANGIER) Beautiful, isn't it? I do miss New York, though. 
ANGIER Why are you here? 
ALLEY The lightning lives here. And noit much else- our work is secret. 
Alley glances down at the notebook and Agier's scribbles. 
ALLEY (CONT'D) A cypher? 
Angier nods as Alley lifts the cardboard notebook. 
ANGIER My profession also deals in secrets. 
Alley looks at the gibberish on the pages of the notebook. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) It's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the dairy. Simple but time-consuming to translate once you have the five-letter keyword. 
ALLEY Which is? 
Angier smiles as he reaches for the notebook. 
ANGIER We magicians have a circle of trust. 
ALLEY You have a circle of trust with someone whose dairy you stole? 
ANGIER Maybe I bought it. 
ALLEY Magicians sell their secrets? 
ANGIER It's how we pay for our retirements and how greats tricks outlive us. 
Alley considers this. Taps the cover of the notebook. 
ALLEY You're hoping to find a great secretin there? 
ANGIER I've already found it. That's why I'm here. 
Angier reaches in his pocket and removes his own, leather- bound journal. He tears a PAGE from it and hands it to Alley. Who unfolds it ans stares at it. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) Tesla built one for another magician. 
ALLEY Why would you want the same thing? 
ANGIER Call it a professional rivalry.

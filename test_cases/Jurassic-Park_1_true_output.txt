BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE - 
Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group, kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along. 
CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear. 
A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and struggling to stay out from underfoot. 
CLOSE ON - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant. 
Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust. 
GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust. 
Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex. 
Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers. The animals continue to close. 
CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet. 
GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks. 
GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood. 
Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl ying in the air.  Above, even the birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along. 
GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle. 
A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex. They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING the rocky enclave they have just left. 
Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move. They watch the herd trample on. 
CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor. 
Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth. 
The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur. 
As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped in dust. 
Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave. 
TIMMY Let's go.  Now! 
The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle. 
Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction. 
BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM - 
Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter. 
Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something. 
HAMMOND No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon? 
ARNOLD I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond. 
HAMMOND My animals!  My animals! 
Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset. 
HAMMOND Where have you been?  My Rex killed a hadrosaur.  You should be out there, doing something. 
MUL DOON I just came to tell you - you're minus one computer expert. 
EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY 
The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy. 
GRANT We'll walk by the river.  That leads back to the Visitor's center. 
LEX Not me.  I'm not walking anymore. 
TIMMY Come on Lex, I'll carry you. 
LEX Nope.  Too scared. 
Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant. 
GRANT You ready? 
She wipes her tears. 
LEX Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't have to walk so close to the animals! 
GRANT What raft? 
Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is twenty yards away. 
LEX 
Where I found Freda's baby. 
Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

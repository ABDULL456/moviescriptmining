Under the normal run of things I would have had nothing to do with the cunt, but this was not the normal run of things. 
MIKEY 
Opium suppositories. Ideal for your purpose. Slow release, like. Bring you down gradually. Custom fucking designed for your needs. 
RENTON 
I want a fucking hit. 
MIKEY 
That's all I've got: take it or leave it. 
Renton sticks his hand down the back of his trousers and sticks the suppositories into his rectum. 
Feel better now? 
RENTON 
For all the good they've done me I might as well have stuck them up my arse. 
He smiles. 
EXT. STREET. DAY 
RENTON (v.o) 
Heroin makes you constipated. The heroin from my last hit is fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt. I am no longer constipated. 
He looks around the local amenities. He is in discomfort, clutching his abdomen and falling to his knees. 
He notices a betting shop. 
INT. BETTING SHOP. DAY 
Renton walks through the crowded, smoky betting shop towards a door marked 'toilet' with a bit of card. 
RENTON (v.o) 
I fantasize about massive pristine convenience. 
He stumbles through. 
(v.o) 
Brilliant gold taps, virginal white marble, a seat carved from ebony, a cistern full of Chanel No. 5, and a flunky handing me pieces of raw silk toilet roll. But under the circumstances I'll settle for anywhere. 
INT. HORRIBLE TOILET. DAY 
This is the most horrible toilet in Britain. 
Alone, Renton makes his way through the horrors to a cubicle. 
INT. HORRIBLE TOILET CUBICLE. DAY 
Renton locks the door. 
He looks into the bowl and winces with disgust, even in his state. 
He pulls the chain. The chain comes off. 
He drops his trousers, sits on the bowl and closes his eyes. 
MONTAGE 
A lorry on a building site dumps a load of bricks, B52's shed their load on Vietnam, the Blue Peter elephant, etc. 
INT. CUBICLE. DAY 
Renton has his eyes closed. They snap open. 
He looks down between his legs. 
He drops to his knees in front of the bowl and rolls his sleeve up. 
With no more hesitation he plunges his arm into the bowl and trawls for the suppositories. 
It seems to take ages. He cannot find them. He sticks his arm further and further into the toilet, moving his whole body close. He strains to find it.

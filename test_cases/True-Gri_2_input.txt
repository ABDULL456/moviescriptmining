The word detonates a fit of coughing. 
. . . You are not going. That is no part of it. 
Mattie You misjudge me if you think I am silly enough to give you fifty dollars and simply watch you ride off. 
Rooster I am a bonded U.S. marshal! 
Mattie That weighs but little with me. I will see the thing done. 
Rooster You never said anything about this. I cannot go up against Ned Pepper and a band of hard men and look after a baby at the same time. 
Mattie I am not a baby. 
Rooster I will not be stopping at boarding houses with warm beds and plates of hot grub on the table. It will be traveling fast and eating light. What little sleeping is done will take place on the ground. 
Mattie I have slept out at night. Papa took me and Little Frank coon hunting last summer on the Petit Jean. We were in the woods all night. We sat around a big fire and Yarnell told ghost stories. We had a good time. 
Rooster Coon hunting! This ain't no coon hunt, it don't come within forty miles of being a coon hunt! 
Mattie It is the same idea as a coon hunt. You are just trying to make your work sound harder than it is. Here is the money. I aim to get Tom Chaney and if you are not game I will find somebody who is game. All I have heard out of you so far is talk. I know you can drink whiskey and snore and spit and wallow in filth and bemoan your station. The rest has been braggadocio. They told me you had grit and that is why I came to you. I am not paying for talk. I can get all the talk I need and more at the Monarch Boarding House. 
Rooster stares, nonplussed. 
He drops back into the rope bed, which sets it swaying. As he stares up at the ceiling: 
Rooster Leave the money. Meet me here tomorrow morning at seven o'clock and we will begin our coon hunt. 
GRANDMA TURNER'S ROOM 
Mattie makes early-morning preparations to leave as Grandma Turner snores. She unrolls her father's traps and takes out a big-brimmed fisherman's hat and puts it on: too big. She lines it with newspaper, experimenting with the amount until it fits. She puts on his coat, gives the sleeves a big cuff. She examines the Colt's dragoon. She drops apples into a sack. 
She finishes by folding a letter she has written and putting it into an envelope. Throughout, we have been hearing its contents in voice-over: 
Mattie Dearest Mother. I am about to embark on a great adventure. Or dare I call it a mission, for shall any of us rest easy ere Papa's death is avenged? My investigations in Fort Smith lead me to believe that Tom Chaney can be found and brought to justice, and I have made arrangements to that end. I will return to you once I have seen them properly carried through. . . 
EXTERIOR BOARDING HOUSE 
Mattie is cinching her gear onto Little Blackie. She mounts and rides off as the letter ends: 
Mattie But do not worry on my account. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. The author of all things watches over me. And I have a fine horse. Kiss Little Frankie for me and pinch Violet's cheek. I am off for the Choctaw Nation. 
INTERIOR GROCERY 
Tracking toward Rooster's rope bed. A hat is pulled down over the face of the figure reclining in it. Smoke sifts up from somewhere. 
Mattie draws up to the figure with mounting concern. She pulls the hat off. It is the elderly Chinese grocer. 
Mattie Where is Marshal Cogburn! 
The grocer reaches a pipe and pulls on it. His manner is dreamy. 
Grocer Went away. . . 
Mattie Away! Where? 
The grocer pulls an envelope from underneath his robe and hands it to Mattie. He closes his eyes and drifts away. 
Mattie pulls a scrap of paper from the envelope and reads: 
Mattie Here inside is a train ticket for your return home. Use it. By the time you read this I will be across the river in the Indian nation. Pursuit would be futile. I will return with your man Chaney. Leave me to my work. Reuben Cogburn. 
Mattie's jaw tightens. She abruptly crumples the paper. 
RIVER 
Mattie gallops down an embankment to a river of some width. At the near-side ferry station a raft enclosed by railing waits, its guide rope strung across the river. A pilot idles on the near shore. 
On the far shore two small figures, mounted, ascend the opposite bank. Mattie draws up in front of the ferryman at the edge of the river. 
Mattie Is that Marshal Cogburn? 
Ferryman That is the man. 
Mattie Who's he with? 
Ferryman I do not know. 
Mattie Take me across.

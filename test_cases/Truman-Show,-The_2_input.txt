YOUTH 1 (more insistent) You wannna read to me? 
The woman looks up, unaware of the boys' presence until now. She quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book.  The other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp. 
YOUTH 2 (menacing) My friend asked you a question. 
The woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and holds it to her.  She looks around the train for assistance, briefly catching Truman's eye.  The youths also look in Truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere. Truman quickly averts his gaze. 
WOMAN (reaching for the book) Please... 
The boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt pocket. 
YOUTH 2 Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends. 
The train pulls into a deserted station.  Feeling vulnerable, the woman jumps up from her seat and exits.  The youths, sensing a chase, also exit.  Scanning the empty platform, the woman realizes she has made a serious error.  Truman watches through the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman but still he remains in his seat. 
YOUTH 1 We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby. 
One of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it in the woman's face. 
YOUTH 2 Don't you wanna know how it ends? 
The boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of their bodies.  The woman looks again in Truman's direction. Again she makes eye contact, eyes pleading. 
WOMAN (screams) Help!!  Please, help!! 
The woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes. Truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door.  There is still time to act.  He stands up and half-reaches for the handle but moves no further. 
The train abruptly pulls away, leaving Truman time to see one of the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel.  Truman bows his head in shame as the train rattles on. 
INT.  SUBWAY STATION.  DAY. 
The train safely out of sight, the YOUTHS promptly release the WOMAN.  She calmly hitches down her skirt, no longer afraid. The young men, no longer angry, help fix her hair and retrieve her shoulder bag. 
WOMAN Thanks. 
The threesome walk along the platform together, as if lifelong friends. 
WOMAN (pondering the incident) He did nothing. 
YOUTH 1 (shrugs, suddenly more couth) Physical violence paralyzes him.  Always has. 
EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DUSK. 
The backyard of a modest but tidy one-story tract home.  Beyond the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy Expressway. 
TRUMAN wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife, MERYL, pulls up the drive in her four-year-old Toyota Camry.  She has a sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new knife-set in a wooden block.  She kisses Truman affectionately on the cheek. 
MERYL (proudly referring to the knife-set) I got it free with the tune-up. 
Looking over Truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch of grass, missed by Truman in one of his passes. 
MERYL You missed a section. 
Meryl enters the house.  Truman restarts the lawnmower and obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn.  As the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass, Truman pulls back abruptly.  He checks the kitchen window for Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut. 
INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY. 
MERYL is applying ointment to her wrists as TRUMAN enters. 
TRUMAN (referring to her hands) Do they hurt? 
MERYL I was afraid I'd seize up during cross. One of the keys kept sticking. 
Truman picks up Meryl's newspaper and skims idly through it.  He notes an article headlined, "SLAYING TRIAL ENTERS SIXTH WEEK". 
TRUMAN (referring to the article) Is he gonna take the stand? 
MERYL (dispassionate, matter-of-fact) No point.  Two eye witnesses saw him near the dumpster where they found the legs. 
She flexes her arthritic wrists. 
MERYL You gonna eat before you leave? 
TRUMAN I'll get something out.

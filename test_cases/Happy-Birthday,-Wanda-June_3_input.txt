WOODLY Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me. 
PENELOPE And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there! 
WOODLY They didn't murder me. 
PENELOPE Paul's only twelve years old. 
WOODLY He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound. 
PENELOPE We've got to rescue him. 
WOODLY If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that. 
PENELOPE He's not your son. 
WOODLY No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight." (pause) On that we can build. 
PENELOPE It's a jungle out there. 
WOODLY That's been said before. 
PENELOPE He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged. 
Lion doorbell roars. 
WOODLY I hate that thing. 
He opens the door, admits SHUTTLE, who carries a bakery box. 
PENELOPE Did you see him? 
SHUTTLE Yeah. 
PENELOPE Is he all right? 
SHUTTLE Far as I know. 
PENELOPE Is he coming home? 
SHUTTLE He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park. 
PENELOPE The park! 
SHUTTLE It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is! 
SHUTTLE I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another. 
PENELOPE (disgusted with him) You figure! 
SHUTTLE Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake. 
PENELOPE A what? 
SHUTTLE For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake. 
PENELOPE How nice. 
SHUTTLE They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else." 
WOODLY "Happy Birthday, Wanda June!" 
SHUTTLE We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife. 
PENELOPE Did you talk to Paul? 
SHUTTLE Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door. 
PENELOPE We've got to find him. (preparing to exit through front door) I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last. (to WOODLY) And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home. (to SHUTTLE) That's all he said--the thing about the key?

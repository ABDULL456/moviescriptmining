THE WATER - BATHERS 
People begin screaming. Kids are suddenly separated from their parents. Others seem to forget how to swim. One myopic little girl has her glasses bumped off and she begins to cry in blinded panic. Ellen Brody looks around frantic. 
BOATS #2, #3, #4 
The riflemen in the boats are trying to get a bead, but too many civilians create a hazard. The Coast Guardsmen attempt to sever the repellent cord to gain access to the bathing area and the heaving fin. 
THE WATER - BATHERS 
This is a confirmation of our worst dread -- a full-blown headlong water panic. Screaming vacationers claw their way over the bodies of the less able. Some literally attempt to walk over the bobbing heads and glistening backs of others pulling for dry land. 
CLOSEUPS - PANIC 
Horrified faces. Some are stunned and wandering in slow, tentative circles, while others are helped out by friends. 
Five people try to mount a rubber raft. 
Ugly reminders that each of us is Number One. 
Brody enters shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone charges past him to help an old man out of the water. 
EXT. THE BEACH 
Dragging the helpless from the surf. Tears well in Brody's eyes. The screaming is deafening. The TV unit is hopping up and down in rage and frustration. 
TV DIRECTOR Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody get that! 
One thousand survivors pack the beach, standing absolutely still. A numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against each other. 
Muted sobs, whimpering, coughing. 
The six burly lifeguards huddle together like Cub Scouts. 
ANGLE - BATHING AREA 
The monstrous black fin turns a slow circle as two Coast Guardsmen manage to cut their own repellent line. All boats converge on the dynamic fin. Men raise their guns to fire. Others adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated fashion. 
CLOSE - FIN 
It slips sideways, revealing for the first time a tiny blue snorkel. Then appears the faces of two youngsters whom we will recall from the coven behind the dune. The fin bobs back, a beaverboard replica attached to a partially submerged surfboard. One youngster looks up and is greeted by: 
YOUNGSTER'S POINT OF VIEW 
Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed directly at him. Surrounding him on three sides. Some of the policemen start to lower their guns -- struck dumb. 
HOOPER IN HIS BOAT 
He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his eyes still restlessly searching. 
CLOSE - YOUNGSTER 
his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his hands in unconditional surrender. 
ANGLE - ESTUARY 
The narrow estuary leading into the half-mile is rough today. 
Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little girl points. 
BLACK DORSAL FIN 
is cruising through the narrows and toward the busy pond. 
HOOPER IN HIS BOAT AGAIN 
He sees it, and jams his throttle forward. He steers with one hand, fumbling urgently for his walkie-talkie with the other. 
AERIAL VIEW 
The circle of boats around the little pranksters, the crowds huddled on the beach, Hooper's boat suddenly arrowing towards the estuary, leaving a huge boiling wake. 
CLOSE ON VAUGHN 
He catches Hooper's boat out of the corner of his eye. Curious, he follows its progress. It's urgency finally communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot across the dunes towards a rise overlooking the estuary. 
OVERLOOKING THE ESTUARY 
Vaughn gets there just in time to see the disaster. He watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath. Stunned. 
ANGLE - POND

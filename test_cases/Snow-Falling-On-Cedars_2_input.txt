There it is.  Kindness in this old man's face.  He brings the other cigarette to his lips.  And Ishmael takes out the match box.  Never breaking eye contact. 
ISHMAEL We don't let go, you s... 
NELS It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point. 
Expertly, Ishmael's fingers withdaw a match. 
NELS You gave this jury three chances. To turn. 
Palming the box, Ishmael STRIKES the match.  On his belt buckle... 
NELS No other way to explain it all. That was one.  I caught some of 'em fluttering, waking up, on that. 
Reaches the flame toward the old man... 
NELS Second.  You sent him to Manzanar, and you didn't do it alone.  I liked that one, they didn't.  No surprise. 
Nels leans to the flame.  Sucks it in.  Savors a drag. 
NELS Last.  You gave your arm.  To buy this woman back her husband. Are they gonna cheat you out of that? 
BAILIFF (O.S., calling out) JURY'S COMIN' IN... 
Everywhere, the buzz RISES, there is motion an expectation.  But Nels doesn't seem to notice. 
NELS Some let go, some don't.  Where did you? 
Asked so casually.  Ishmael turns.  Hatsue is standing now, surrounded by people, her mother grasping her arm. 
ISHMAEL (a murmur) Hooks called her deceitful. And I knew she wasn't. 
He's watching her.  Across the way.  So intently. 
ISHMAEL She was an honest person.  Doing the best she could. 
We follow her approach toward the courtroom door.  She has not yet turned to us. 
NELS (O.S.) The prosecutor, the judge, cut her off.  She was desperate.  Her husband helpless...I was helpless... 
Nels rises.  With great effort. 
NELS You couldn't let her.  Be helpless. 
Ishmael's eyes still fixed to Hatsue, grim-faced, listening to her mother's murmurings, as she... 
...disappears through the door.  Never having looked our way. 
NELS When this verdict is read.  She may look for your face. 
And Ishmael's eyes come up.  Because the voice commands it. 
NELS Here's what she needs to see:  This is nothing.  We win it on appeal. 
The old man is stern and strong.  He wants a promise. 
ISHMAEL It'll be there. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
The hush of a hundred silences.  We can feel the air crackle in the stillness.  Judge Fielding is leafing through papers.  No one coughs, no one blinks... 
JUDGE (clears his throat) Mister foreman, has the jury reached a verdict? 
He looks up.  Across the distance, Harold Jensen rises in the jury box. 
HAROLD JENSEN We have, Your Honor. 
And holds out a slip of paper.  Little more than a scrap.  Folded once. 
JUDGE Will the bailiff please bring the verdict to the bench. 
The bailiff does so, walking crisply to minimize his moment in the limelight.  He hands the slip to the judge, who unfolds it, and... 
...stops.  Staring for a hung instant.  As if seeing something unexpected.  he folds it again, rather carefully, thoughtfully, and as he hands it back to the bailiff... 
JUDGE (softly) Will the defendant please rise. 
Kabuo and Nels rise together.  But it is only into the defendant's eyes that the judge stares.  No expression in the face of either man.  But something passes, all the same. 
As the bailiff crosses to return the verdict to the foreman, we SNAP TO... 
REVERSE ANGLE...every pair of eyes in the room are on the foreman, now opening the slip of paper. 
Every pair.  But one. 
JUDGE (O.S.) Will the foreman please read the verdict aloud. 
One reporter stares across the grain of all other sight lines. Toward a woman who does not see him.  In case she needs his eyes. To be waiting. 
HAROLD JENSEN (reads) We the jury, find the defendant, Kabuo Kenji Miyamoto, to be not guilty of the cri... 
A sharp SCREAM, and the defendant's mother-in-law covers her mouth in embarrassment. 
HAROLD JENSEN (continues) ...of the crime with which he has been char... 
APPLAUSE breaks out from the back row of the gallery, where citizens of Japanese ancestry have forgotten custom and decorum, as has... 
...a woman who comes OUT of her seat, tears on her face, not even realizing she is standing, Hatsue clings to the railing that separates her from her husband.  Throughout the gallery, now... 
...some of the citizens assembled add their applause.  Others look awkward, not knowing how to react. 
The gavel lies untouched, unnoticed, by a jurist who has no problem with anything that is taking place right now.  Saying only to the jury... 
JUDGE This is your verdict, so say you all? 
As they assent... 
JUDGE This Court thanks you for the good work you have done under difficult circumstances... 
Reaches STRONG to the gavel, turns to the defendant... 
JUDGE Go home, son.  God bless.

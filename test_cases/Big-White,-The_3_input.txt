PAUL (picking it up) It was a gift from Raymond.  He bought it for me from Florida.  It's all we have to remember him by. 
Paul puts the shell down on the desk. 
TED That and a million dollars.  Things really worked out for you, didn't they? lots of cash, newly single guy... 
PAUL I'm not single. 
TED ...so you gonna head down to Club Med?  See how much fun a big bank roll can buy? 
PAUL Mr. Watters, I love my wife.  Very much. 
Ted can't help but look confused by this simple, yet sincere declaration. 
TED Can we level with each other for a moment? (Paul nods) Did you -- 
Before he can finish his question, a DELIVERY DRIVER entering the office with a large box. 
PAUL Avis!  Avis? 
There's no answer.  She's in the back. 
PAUL (cont'd) Will you excuse me? 
Paul gets up to deal with the delivery.  Ted, sullen, picks up the shell and turns it over in his hands.  Avis enter from the back.  She smiles at Ted, then sees the shell. 
AVIS Oh, that's where you went. 
She takes the shell and reattaches it to the display for Aloha Air.  Ted, confused, walks over as Avis snaps the shell back into place. 
TED That's quite the display. 
AVIS They do some very nice in store promotions. 
Paul walks back, shocked to see the shell now back on the display.  Ted just stares at him. 
AVIS (cont'd) Here it is Mr. Barnell. (to Ted) I thought someone might have walked out with it.  It's not the best neighborhood. 
Avis walks back to her desk.  Ted and Paul hold their look.  Finally, Paul walks back to his desk and the paperwork. 
PAUL So, right here, by the X. 
Ted nods.  Paul signs.  Ted takes the envelope with the check, hands it to Paul but doesn't let go.  Paul tries to pull it free.  He looks at Ted who looks right through him.  Just then, the lights go out.  They're all in the dark. 
PAUL (cont'd) We, uh... Avis?  Call Municipal Light and Power and let them know I'll... stop by in a bit. 
Paul looks at Ted, embarrassed.  Ted finally lets go of the check. 
PAUL (cont'd) Thank you. 
Ted shakes his head, gets up and walks out.

Paul, seen through the window, sits alone in the dark.  His face lit only by a small flashlight, he is completely still. 
110   INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                                 110 
Tiffany on her headset with a customer.  Ted on the sofa, lost in thought and whatever's on the TV. 
TIFFANY There's nothing to be embarrassed about. (a snide glance at Ted) A lot of people find talking to a psychic very therapeutic.  So what's on your mind, Carlos? 
111   INTERCUT WITH: "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - CONT.                        111 
An overwrought Paul is on the phone with Tiffany, sitting in the dark.  He's got his home phone bill in front of him. 
PAUL I have a situation.  My wife...  do you think it's okay to do something kinda bad to someone if you think they're gonna do something really bad to someone else? 
TIFFANY Sure. 
PAUL What if it's a really bad thing? 
TIFFANY Well, you probably shouldn't break the law if you can help it.  Are you really sure they're going to do this other thing? 
PAUL I'm... I... I don't know.  He said some things.  He said he was joking, but I... I think he might. 
TIFFANY Don't think, know.  How close are you to the other someone else, the one you're trying to protect? 
PAUL (crying) I just, I just...  Have you ever felt like that?  Like your own life didn't even matter, as long as...

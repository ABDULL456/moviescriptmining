Lucius:  My mother is unaware of the reason for my visit today.  She did not give her consent, or consult me in any form.  The passing of little Daniel Nicholson, from illness, and other events, have weighed on my thoughts.  I ask permission to cross into the forbidden woods and travel to the nearest town.  I will gather medicines, and I will return.  With regards to Those We Don't Speak Of, I am certain they will let me pass.  Creatures can sense emotion and fear.  They will see I am pure of intention, and not afraid.  The end. 
His voice has been shaky throughout.  It is clear that such a long speech from him is an unheard-of, thing, and that he is normally so quiet that people ask him to speak up.  The elders stare at him.  The wind moans past the watchtower. 
Alice (off-screen):  What goes on in that head of yours? 
Inside their house, all is simple.  The beams of the loft are visible.  The floor is plain wood.  Alice stands in an ankle-length nightgown, in the doorway of her bedroom.  An oil-lamp and some candles are lit.  There is no electricity, running water, or flush toilets in this village, although such things are available in other parts of the world.  Lucius sits on the stairs, tying his boot-laces. 
Alice:  Say something, Lucius. 
Lucius:  Finton Coin is in the tower, and I've promised to sit with him. 
Alice:  Hmm. 
In the watchtower, we see Finton Coin, a broad-faced, light-haired young man with Grecian features, wearing a yellow cloak.  Lucius sits on the floor near a lamp. 
Lucius:  Do you ever think of the towns, Finton? 
Finton:  The towns?  What for?  They're wicked places where wicked people live.  That's all. 
He pauses for a few moments. 
Finton:  Thank you Lucius.  You're a good friend.  I do hope no one saw you. 
In the orchard, several women stand, staring at a spectacle.  It is another skinned fox. 
There is a brief meeting in the meeting hall.  Alice stands at the front, ahead of the elders, and speaks to the villagers' concerns.

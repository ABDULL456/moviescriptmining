Holds the door. After a moment the W.M.M. enters past the Valet. As the screams of the children continue to rise and fall. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBURBAN LONDON ESTATE - A BEAUTIFUL STUDY - EVENING 
The Well-Manicured Man enters, picks up a blinking line. Through a window he can still see the children playing. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Yes. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN (FILTER) We have a situation. The members are assembling. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Is it an emergency? 
INTERCUT WITH TIGHT CSM AT INT. KENSINGTON BUILDING (NEXT LOC.) 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Yes. A meeting is set. Tonight in London, to determine a course. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Who called this meeting? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis. 
This pronouncement has the power of ending any further questions. An immediate sense of gravity of the situation. The W.M.M. hangs up, moves to the window where he sees some of the HELP is running from the house. The children have all gathered around a BOY who seems to have hurt himself. He's lifted and being carried by the man who's called the W.M.M. into the house. 
Off the Well-Manicured Man's concern, we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT 
A discreet Town Car pulls up out front an understated building in a better West End neighborhood. A driver exits coming around for the Well-Manicured Man who is already exiting, moving to the building. As a LEGEND appears: KENSINGTON, LONDON: 8:01 PM. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KENSINGTON BUILDING - NIGHT 
The Well-Manicured Man is admitted by a Valet. The interior has the well-heeled look of money, or a finely appointed residence that no one lives in. The Valet takes the W.M.M.'s coat. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Has Strughold arrived? 
VALET They're in the library. 
He leads the W.M.M. down a hall, to: 
INT. LARGE STATELY LIBRARY - NIGHT 
A GROUP OF MEN are standing, looking at something on a TV monitor. A surveillance video. They turn when the W.M.M. enters. CAMERA FAVORING A SMALL LEAN MAN with close-cropped hair. 
He is at once elegant and imposing with eyes that hold you with laser-like acuity. He is CONRAD STRUGHOLD. 
The others are of various ethnicities, tailored and dignified. This might be a collection of U.N. delegates. Indeed some are. 
Their business here, however, doesn't represent anyone's interests but their own. As tipped by the attendance of a GROUP ELDER from the U.S. who we've come to know. 
But, more importantly, by the Cigarette Smoking Man who holds the VCR remote. He pauses the picture. 
STRUGHOLD We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg. 
The non-response to this has the same effect as a reprimand. But the W.M.M. will not apologize of kowtow. 
STRUGHOLD While we've been made to wait, we've watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns. 
The Well-Manicured Man glances to the TV, sees the frame paused. 
HIS POV OF TV MONITOR 
Where Mulder and Scully's faces are seen in a hallway that we recognize as the Bethesda Naval Hospital. 
RESUME WELL-MANICURED MAN 
WELL-MANICURED MAN More concerns than that? 
STRUGHOLD We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves. 
GROUP ELDER (speaking up) The virus has mutated. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN On its own? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Into what? 
STRUGHOLD A new extraterrestrial biological entity. 
It takes a moment to sink in. The weight of this fact.

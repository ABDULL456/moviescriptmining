Cogsworth waddles in after him.   Plumette flutters nervously. 
COGSWORTH No, you don't! If the master finds out you violated his orders and fed her, he will blame me. 
Lumiere jumps up onto the sink, navigating sudsy dishes as CHAPEAU scrubs them. 
LUMIÈRE Yes, I will make sure of it. But did you see her stand up to him? I am telling you, this girl is the one. They must fall in love if we are to be human again, and they can't fall in love if she stays in her room. (looks at a smudged dish) Eh, Chapeau, you missed a spot! 
Lumière tosses the dish back in the sink, skipping onto a passing tea trolley. Cogsworth climbs up in pursuit. 
COGSWORTH You know she will never love him. 
LUMIÈRE A broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami, and this is not one of those times. 
Lumière leaps onto the table, and uprights a champagne glass. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Stand up straight! (to the room) It's time to sparkle! 
He leaps again, onto CUISINIÈR, and sips a spoonful from a bubbling pot. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) I have no taste buds, but I can tell this is exquisite. 
CUISINIÈR Off! Off me while I work! Pepper, get cracking! Salt, shake a leg! 
COGSWORTH Not so loud! Keep it down! 
LUMIÈRE Of course, of course. But what is dinner without a little... music? 
COGSWORTH Music?! 
57   INT. DINING ROOM - CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER                  57 
To Cogsworth's horror, Lumière guides an ambulatory HARPSICHORD into the room. This is CADENZA, our neurotic Italian maestro. 
LUMIÈRE Maestro Cadenza, are you ready? 
CADENZA (coy) It has been so long since I've performed! I can barely even remember how... 
But with an abrupt flourish, Cadenza plays show-offy scales on the ivories until -- PLUNK. 
CADENZA (CONT'D) Another cavity. 
LUMIÈRE Maestro, your wife is upstairs, finding it harder and harder to stay awake. She's counting on you to help us break this curse. 
CADENZA Then, I shall play through the dental pain! 
COGSWORTH (whispers to Cadenza) But Maestro. Play quietly. Please. 
CADENZA Quietly? Sotto voce? Of course. Are there any other tasteless demands you wish to make upon my artistry? 
COGSWORTH No, that's it. 
Mrs. Potts leads Belle to the end of the long dining table. 
MRS. POTTS There you are, dear. 
Lumière LEAPS onto the table. Floating at a high window, Plummette uses a silver platter to turn a shaft of moonlight into a SPOTLIGHT. As Lumière begins "BE OUR GUEST." 
LUMIÈRE Ma chere, mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now, we invite you to relax. 
Belle sits down in a chair, which moves in, bringing her closer to the table. Lumière motions up to Plumette to steady her shaky spotlight. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Let us pull up a chair... as the dining room proudly presents... 
Cadenza plays a dramatic scale as a table cloth UNFURLS, and Lumière jumps up and LANDS in a pose. Cadenza ends his scale on the wrong note. Lumière shoots him a look, Cadenza plays the right note, and Lumière turns to Belle and smiles. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) ... your dinner. (sings to Belle) Be our guest, be our guest 
The napkins on the place settings rise up and twirl.   Chapeau offers Belle a napkin. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Put our service to the test Tie your napkin `round your neck, cherie And we provide the rest! 
Spinning quickly, Chapeau presents the following to Belle: 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres Why we only live to serve Try the grey stuff, it's delicious 
Belle reaches out to try it, but it's gone before she can. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Don't believe me? Ask the dishes! 
The hors d'oeuvres plates go off, leaving the dinner dishes to levitate and spin.

ANDY (cuts him off) I told you -- no one knows I'm here! I'm house-sitting... (out of patience, frustrated and frightened) This place belongs to a doctor friend of my parents. He's in China now, on research... won't be back for six months. The medical center only has my apartment address. Even my friends don't have this number. (beat) Will you believe me?! We're safe here. 
Storm studies her for a long beat.   Then:   a voice comes onto the phone line. 
STORM (into phone) Esposito? (furious) Listen, you sonofabitch -- 
EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE (OJAI) - EVENING 
We see a little more of where we are: a pretty little retreat, nestled amid rolling hills. With the evening light, the mood seems softer. 
INT. ARMSTEEAD HOUSE - LIVING ROCM - EVENING 
Storm on a different couch -- very tired. Looking terrible. Andy sits on the floor at the coffee table --a

phone beside her, the table covered with notepads, scribbled pages. 
ANDY We'll find your friend O'Malley. We'll just keep phoning ... 
STORM Listen.     I'm getting out of here. 
He grabs for a cane resting against the sofa. 
ANDY (knows he has no chance) I'll buy tickets to that. 
STORM I just need some food -- and a few days to get my strength. 
ANDY Days?   Try a few weeks. 
Storm braces against the cane, ready to try to stand. Andy gets up, to catch him. This infuriates Storm's pride. 
STORM You helped me, okay? I'm grateful. But every day you keep helping puts you in more danger. 
ANDY (deadpan) Danger is my middle name. 
This is no joke to Storm. 
STORM I've been dead, Andy.      You wouldn't like it. 
He tries to get up.    Andy stops him. 
ANDY Hey, hey -- I don't think you get the picture here. Your muscles have been getting electronic stimulation at the hospital, but it's not like actually being up and bearing weight. 
STORM You're the one who doesn't get the picture. (MORE)

STORM (CONT'D) First of all, I ain't no fucking invalid! And second, I don't have time -- 
He makes it upright, shaking, with a "See, I told you" look. 
He starts toward the kitchen. Andy looks very worried but doesn't try to stop him. First step -- okay. Second -- okay. Third -- blam! The cane slips and he falls flat on his face. Too weak to break the fall. 
LOW ANGLE - STORM 
We see his face on the carpet and a mean desperate conviction in these eyes not to fail and not to give up. He struggles to rise -- it is pitiful. He's on his knees growling with effort. Cane propped up, he manages to somehow stand again. One step ... two steps ... three, four ... he's absolutely exhausted. Boom! Falls flat again. 
ANOTHER LOW ANGLE 
Storm's face on the floor. 
EXTREME CLOSEUP 
Fury, frustration, despair -- 
ANDY 
grabs his arm and helps him back onto the couch. She exits the room and comes back momentarily with a bowl of rice and begins to try to feed him. Of course he takes the fork away and tries it himself, but by now his arms are so fatigued from the previous strain that they shake, his hand trembles and he misses his mouth -- getting the rice all down his beard. Spilling a little too much to ignore and at first it looks like he's going to explode. He looks up at Andy, who looks so sad. 
Storm breaks out laughing and so does Andy. They howl together for a while and then settle down. Now Andy begins to "help" feed Storm. 
INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - STORM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Storm is in bed -- writing something on a note pad.

ANDY (next to bed) Mata Hari -- at your service.

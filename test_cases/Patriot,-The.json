SOUTH CAROLINA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nWoodlands.  Beautiful.  Untamed.  Soaring old-growth elms arch over riverside maples along the shores of the gently curving, deep-water Santee River. \nSUPERIMPOSITION: \nSOUTH CAROLINA April, 1776 \nUpstream, the swamps.  Beautiful.  Hundreds of BIRDS SING. Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, cutting through the hanging moss and kudzu, falling onto soft, swaying ferns covering the high ground. \nThe water is clear, with fields of floating lily pads, each with a stark white flower rising from it. \nSUPERIMPOSITION: \nTHE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY \nEXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY \nA farm built between the banks of the river and the deep green of the swamps.  Good, fertile land, hacked out of the wilderness. \nThe perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops, alfalfa and tobacco.  Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 and SAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging scythes through the barley. \nThe house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge. It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches. \nGABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a musket. \nINT.  WORKSHOP - DAY \nA perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with every conceivable tool of the period.  A foot-powered lathe.  A drop-forge.  A lifting saw.  Racks of tools, planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in their places.  All very well-worn. \nFRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor-sharp chisel.  He's in his late-forties, strong and weathered.  His hands, though big and callused, handle the chisel with a surgeon's precision.  Self-educated and self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth. \nA finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on which Marion is working, sits on the work table.  The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. \nSitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face wisp of a child, watches her father. \nMarion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefully fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into place.  Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork. \nHe picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale, countering with a three-pound weight.  The chair floats. \nMarion blows softly on the weight which sinks.  Susan nods, so far, so good.  Marion puts the chair on the floor and walks slowly around it, checking every angle. \nThen, the acid test.  He takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time. Not a creak.  He smiles and sits back with a sigh. \nCRACK!  THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPING HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood. \nMARION Damnation! \nHe picks up some of the wood, about to fling it across the room but stops as Susan shoots him a disapproving look. He calms himself. \nMARION Sorry. \nSusan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of the chair in the fireplace.  As she climbs back up to her perch, Marion steps over to his wood rack, extracts a fresh dowel, fits it into the lathe and starts all over again. \nEND CREDITS. \nEXT.  WORKSHOP - DUSK \nMarion leaves the workshop with Susan at his side.  Nathan and Samuel walk past, exhausted from their day in the field. \nNATHAN Father, I saw a post rider at the house. \nMARION Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field? \nSAMUEL We got it all cut and we bundled half of it. \nMARION Those swimming breaks cut into the day, don't they? \nMarion walks on without waiting for a reply from his contrite sons who jostle one another, trying to pass off the blame.  Gabriel and Thomas walk out of the barn. \nGABRIEL Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside. \nMARION Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk? \nTHOMAS Better.  She's near ready to calve. \nMarion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and Thomas to the house.  She does so and Marion walks on alone toward: \nEXT.  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - SUNSET \nThe loveliest spot on the farm.  A beautiful view of the house, barns, river, fields and hills beyond.  A gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree.  It reads: \nELIZABETH PUTNAM MARION   1738-1773 \nAbove her name is a carving of the night sky, at the center of which is the NORTH STAR, steady and guiding. \nMarion approaches.  He gives himself a moment to look at the grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to the gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter-of-fact than sorrowful. \nMARION ... and they bundled half... almost no trace of the boys you knew... \nA soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground. Marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply. \nMARION ... no, she still hasn't spoken... Margaret was her age when you... I remember the time at the river when we couldn't find Catherine... you couldn't stop crying... and she was asleep in the wagon the entire time... \nEXT.  BENNINGTON OVERLOOK - DAY \nThe two carriages pass a view of their entire valley. Scattered farms with a patchwork of cultivated fields surrounding the town of Bennington. \nEXT.  SANTEE ROAD - DAY \nPassing through rolling farmland, the Marions head toward the coast.  They pass a large contingent of South Carolina Militia, drilling in a field.  The children, particularly Gabriel, watch avidly. \nEXT.  CHARLESTON - DAY \nA big, bustling city.  Marion and Gabriel negotiate the carriages through the busy streets.  The children watch, wide-eyed, seeing taverns, a public gallows, drunkards, street entertainers, well-dressed ladies attended by their maids, food venders, a man with a trained bear. \nEXT.  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - CHARLESTON - DAY \nGrand.  Four stories.  Marion and his children pull up. CHARLOTTE MOTTE hurries out.  She's in her mid-thirties, beautiful, with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden as best she can. \nThe children leap from the carriages and swarm around her, embracing her, smothering her with kisses. \nTHE CHILDREN Aunt Charlotte!  Aunt Charlotte! \nCHARLOTTE Welcome!  Welcome!  Margaret, William, look at you...! (to Marion) They're huge.  What have you been feeding them? \nMARION They're from good stock on their mother's side. \nCHARLOTTE Thank you. \nCharlotte hustles the children toward the door. \nCHARLOTTE Come, come, inside, wait until you see what I have... \nTHE CHILDREN (simultaneous) Presents!  For me?  What do you have? \nCHARLOTTE Inside, inside... \nCharlotte sweeps past Marion who smiles and follows her into the house. \nINT.  PARLOR - CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - DAY \nMarion watches as Charlotte finishes handing out presents. Susan plays with a new doll.  William has half-a-dozen new spinning tops, skimming around the floor.  Margaret holds a new dress up to herself.  Samuel, Nathan and Thomas tear into packages holding platoons of lead soldiers.  Gabriel looks through a new book. \nCharlotte sees Marion watching her, rises and joins him at the doorway. \nMARION You look well, Charlotte. \nCHARLOTTE As do you. \nSuddenly Thomas and Samuel race through the doorway, forcing Marion and Charlotte together, their bodies close. They step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles. \nThe moment is broken by the SOUND OF CHILDREN.  Marion and Charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them. \nEXT.  CHARLESTON SQUARE - NIGHT \nDown the block from the Motte house.  A yelling crowd of Sons of Liberty is massed around a Liberty Tree from which hang dozens of glowing lanterns.  Most of the men in the crowd are drunk.  Vendors sell rum, ale, food and banners emblazoned with a coiled snake and the legend, \"Don't Tread On Me.\"  Scores of on-lookers, including respectable people, as well as street urchins, whores and drunkards, watch the proceedings. \nSeveral Sons of Liberty string up effigies of King George III and Governor Wilmington.  They light the effigies on fire.  As they begin to blaze, the crowd cheers. \nEXT.  CHARLOTTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT \nMarion's children, except Gabriel, stand on the balcony watching the mob.  Marion steps out onto the balcony. \nMARION Inside, all of you... \nThe children turn to Marion with stricken expressions. Marion relents. \nMARION Very well. \nThe children turn back to the mob.  Marion joins them. \nTHOMAS Look!  There's Gabriel! \nThey see Gabriel making his way through the crowd.  He sees them and waves, then enters the house. \nA moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and sees: \nIN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then start hacking at it's groin with a sword. \nAppalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at the children. \nCHARLOTTE Children, inside!  All of you! Right now. \nThe children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte's resolute expression makes them think better of it.  They file into the house.  Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and shoos the children inside.  Gabriel steps out and joins them. \nMARION What news? \nGABRIEL The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army. \nMARION Is that why the Assembly was convened? \nGABRIEL Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money. \nMARION And the Governor? \nGABRIEL He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body. \nMARION Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence. \nCHARLOTTE And send us to war alongside Massachusetts. \nMARION Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought. \nGABRIEL Lee is counting on your vote and expects you to be the first to enlist. \nMarion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks of Lee's expectations.  Marion turns back to watch the mob. \nEXT.  ASSEMBLY HALL - CHARLESTON - DAY \nThe capital building of South Carolina.  A large crowd of lower-class men and women is massed in front of the Assembly Hall.  As well-dressed Assemblymen walk into the building, the CROWD YELLS words of encouragement to some and berates others. \nLEE A long time ago... \nMARION Thirteen years... \nLEE That's a damn long time... \nThe Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL again. \nSPEAKER Gentlemen!  Please! \nMarion and Lee ignore the speaker. \nMARION You were an Englishman then... \nLEE I was an American, I just didn't know it yet... \nThe astonished Assemblymen and now even the Speaker watch the argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneous anticipation of each rejoinder. \nMARION We don't have to go to war to gain independence... \nLEE Balderdash! \nMARION There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal... \nLEE Name five hundred. \nMARION Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery... \nLEE That's five, keep going... \nMARION ... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery... \nLEE You said bribery twice... \nMarion speaks slowly and firmly. \nMARION We do not have to go to war to gain independence. \nLee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks more seriously, quietly, grimly. \nLEE Francis, I was at Bunker Hill.  It was as bad as anything you and I saw on the frontier.  Worse than the slaughter at the Ashuelot River. The British advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range.  And still, they advanced and they took the ground.  That is the measure of their resolve.  If your principles dictate independence, then war is the only way.  It has come to that. \nMarion is silent for a long moment.  He softens, finds himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever wanted to. \nMARION I have seven children.  My wife is dead.  Who's to care for them if I go to war? \nLee is stunned by Marion's honesty and his show of weakness.  At first Lee has no answer, then: \nLEE Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles. \nMARION That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead. \nLEE And your principles? \nMARION I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles. \nThe other Assemblymen, both Patriots and Loyalists, stare at him, appalled.  Marion, feeling weak, sits down.  Lee looks at his friend with more sympathy than disappointment.  Then Lee turns to Robinson who addresses the chair. \nROBINSON Mister Speaker, I call for a vote on a levy to the Continental Army. \nHAMILL Second. \nSPEAKER So moved. \nThe vote is taken on a roll call.  Gabriel watches from the gallery. \nSPEAKER Mr. Robinson. \nROBINSON Yea. \nSPEAKER Mr. Hamill. \nHAMILL Yea. \nSPEAKER Mr. Johnson. \nJOHNSON Yea. \nSPEAKER Mr. Simms. \nSIMMS Nay. \nSPEAKER Mr. Marion. \nNo response. \nSPEAKER Mr. Marion. \nMARION Nay. \nIn the gallery Gabriel turns and walks out.  The roll call continues.  Marion sits, eyes straight ahead. \nEXT.  ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY \nThe crowd waits.  The doors open and a PAGE BOY dashes out and runs to the Continental Captain at the recruiting table. \nPAGE BOY Twenty-eight to twelve, the levy passed! \nThe Continental Captain motions to an assembled squadron. They raise their muskets and FIRE A VOLLEY into the air. Other soldiers, STRIKE UP A MARTIAL AIR ON FIFES AND DRUMS.  Volunteers crowd around the recruiting table, YELLING and jostling for position. \nThe delegates walk out.  Both Patriots and Loyalists give Marion a wide berth. \nMarion sees Gabriel, standing near the crowd at the recruiting table.  Marion walks up to him. \nGABRIEL Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle. \nMARION When you have children, I hope you'll understand. \nMARION No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here. \nThomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets.  He gives one to Nathan and offers the other to his father. \nMARION Put those away. \nTHOMAS But father, they might come this way. \nMARION Put them away. \nReluctantly, Thomas takes the muskets back into the house. \nMARION Enough.  I'll be in the workshop. Samuel, the cows.  Thomas, attend to your studies here on the porch. Nathan, on the back porch.  If you see anyone, come get me.  Margaret, please keep William close to you. No one is to go past the yard wall. \nThey all nod.  Marion walks off toward the workshop, followed by Susan.  The others hesitate. \nMARION Children. \nThey head off to do as they were told. \nINT.  WORKSHOP - DAY \nMarion works the lathe.  Susan watches from her perch on the woodpile. \nEXT.  BARN - DAY \nThe SOUND OF A CRASH from inside the barn.  An angry cow runs out of the barn, dragging a tenacious Samuel who is holding onto the cow's neck. \nSamuel's grip fails and he lands in the dirt.  The cow runs about thirty yards down the hill, stopping on the bank of the river.  Samuel grabs a rope and heads down the hill to get the cow. \nON THE RIVERBANK \nAs Samuel approaches the cow, he see it skittishly approaching then retreating from the water.  Then he sees the cause -- the water in the river has a pale, pink hue. Samuel stares at it, trying to figure out what it is. \nBehind him, Margaret sees her brother beyond the yard wall. \nMARGARET Samuel... \nHe doesn't respond.  Margaret, trailed by William, walks down toward Samuel. \nMARGARET Samuel, get up to the house.  You heard father... \nThen she sees it, too.  The pale pink is turning redder and redder.  And then the BODIES.  First one, then more, many more.  Torn apart.  Missing limbs.  Those with wide- open wounds, are already drained of blood.  Others are still seeping, leaving trails of deep red in the paler red of the surrounding water. \nSamuel, Margaret and William stand frozen, appalled and fascinated. \nMARION steps out of the workshop and sees the children at the river.  He can't see what they're looking at. Irritated, he walks toward them.  Then, as he nears the river, he sees the color of the water and the bodies that have hypnotized his children.  He quickens his stride, speaking calmly but firmly, careful not to frighten them. \nMARION Up to the house, now.  All of you, come on.  Now. \nEXT.  MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nQuiet.  Dark.  Marion stands on the front porch, looking out into the night, listening, hearing nothing.  He glances up at the star-filled sky, tracking his eyes from the Big Dipper to the NORTH STAR. \nBEHIND THE HOUSE, A FIGURE IN THE DARKNESS, carrying a musket, moves from shadow to shadow. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMargaret and Samuel and William talk, their voices low. \nSAMUEL They're going to come. \nMARGARET Quiet. \nSAMUEL We're going to have to fight them off. \nWILLIAM Father will do that. \nSAMUEL They'll probably kill us men and do Lord knows what to you women. \nMARGARET Samuel! \nA SOUND.  They all stop.  Something moved behind the kitchen.  Margaret silently eases the others out of the room, through the darkened hall toward their father. \nSUDDENLY IN FRONT OF THEM, A BLOODY FIGURE \nBig.  Hulking.  In uniform.  Margaret SCREAMS.  William and Samuel CRY OUT.  The figure moves toward them... \nMarion, on the porch, hears the scream, races into the house.  He sees the figure, moves toward it... \nTHE FIGURE MOVES INTO THE LIGHT... Marion sees the bloodied face... \nMARION Gabriel! \nGabriel is wounded, battered and dirty.  He carries a musket and a dispatch case.  He sways.  Marion catches him and eases him to a seat. \nMARGARET You're hurt. \nTHOMAS The battle, were you there? \nMARION Margaret, get bandages and water. Thomas, the porch, eyes open. \nMarion checks Gabriel's wounds which are nasty but not life-threatening. \nGABRIEL Have you seen any Redcoats? \nMARION Not yet.  What happened? \nMargaret brings water and linen to Marion who expertly cleans Gabriel's wounds and applies field-dressings. \nGABRIEL It wasn't like Saratoga.  There, we stayed in the trees, but this time Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats.  They fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw.  I was given these dispatches... I saw Virginia Regulars surrender... as they laid down their weapons the British Green Dragoons rode into them and hacked them to bits... killed them all, over two hundred men. \nMarion's appalled. \nMARION They had surrendered? \nGabriel nods.  Marion's stunned.  Gabriel tries to rise. \nThe three wounded Patriots who just left Marion's farm hear the horses coming, stand on the side of the road, raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender. \nThe Green Dragoons rein in.  Tarleton stops in front of the three men.  He motions for one of his men to lower his weapon.  Then he speaks calmly, quietly, to the wounded men. \nTARLETON You're surrendering. \nCONTINENTAL SERGEANT Yes, sir. \nTARLETON What unit? \nCONTINENTAL SERGEANT First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton. \nTARLETON Who cared for your wounds? \nThey hesitate. \nCONTINENTAL SERGEANT We did. \nTARLETON With a lace table cloth? \nTarleton turns to his second-in-command, MAJOR WILKINS. \nTARLETON Kill them. \nTarleton rides off.  Wilkins and several other Dragoons calmly FIRE THEIR PISTOLS, killing the three Patriots. The troops ride off, thundering past the bodies of the three men. \nEXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY \nMarion and his children tend the wounded.  Gabriel, weak but walking, helps.  REDCOAT INFANTRY appears out of the woods, heading toward the house.  Three dozen men.  Scouts and flank units covering the main body.  Marion gathers his family around him, stands and waits. \nThe Redcoats get to the house, warily eye the wounded and Marion's family.  A young REDCOAT LIEUTENANT motions his men to check out the house and barn, then looks at the wounded, doing a silent count.  He turns to Marion. \nREDCOAT LIEUTENANT These men are of my regiment.  Thank you. \nMarion nods.  ONE OF THE REDCOATS emerges from the house carrying Gabriel's dispatch case. \nREDCOAT Rebel dispatches, sir. \nGabriel steps up. \nGABRIEL I carried those.  I was wounded, these people gave me care, they have nothing to do with the dispatches. \nREDCOAT LIEUTENANT I understand. \nThe SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES.  All turn and see: \nTARLETON AND THE GREEN DRAGOONS \nThundering down the road toward the house.  It's an impressive, frightening sight. \nThey rein in their horses, stopping in the yard, enveloped by their trailing cloud of dust. \nTarleton surveys the scene, then speaks to the young Redcoat Lieutenant. \nTARLETON Lieutenant, have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at Camden crossing.  Use whatever horses and wagons you can find here. \nREDCOAT LIEUTENANT Yes, sir. \nHe hands the dispatch case to Tarleton. \nREDCOAT LIEUTENANT We found this, sir. \nTarleton opens it and quickly scans the contents. \nTARLETON Who carried this? \nGABRIEL I did. \nTARLETON (to Lt. re: Gabriel) Take this one to Camden, he's a spy. He will be hung. \nMarion quickly steps between Tarleton and Gabriel. \nMARION Colonel, he's a dispatch rider and that's a marked dispatch case. \nTarleton ignores Marion and continues speaking to the Lieutenant. \nTARLETON Fire the house and barns. \nREDCOAT LIEUTENANT Yes, sir. \nMARION Colonel... \nREDCOAT LIEUTENANT And the Rebel wounded? \nTARLETON Kill them. \nThe Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men are shocked by the order.  Marion is, also, but he's more concerned with Gabriel.  He pushes past some Redcoats and stands at Tarleton's mount, looking up. \nMARION A dispatch rider with a marked case cannot be held for spying. \nTarleton finally pays attention to Marion.  He looks down at his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles. \nTARLETON We're not going to hold him, we're going to hang him. \nMARION But... \nTarleton draws his pistol and points it at Marion. Gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burly Redcoat Corporal. \nGABRIEL Father... \nTARLETON Oh, he's your son.  You should have taught him about loyalty. \nMARION Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.  By the rules of war, a dispatch rider with a marked case... \nTarleton controls his shifting mount, keeping his pistol trained on Marion's face. \nTARLETON Would you like a lesson in the rules of war? \nCHARLOTTE They're asleep. \nMarion is silent.  Charlotte pours water into a washbowl and motions to Marion.  He takes off his shirt.  She begins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound on his neck. \nMARION How did this... how did I let this happen? \nCHARLOTTE You couldn't have known. \nMARION I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her... \nCHARLOTTE Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed. \nMARION I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed. \nShe looks at him closely. \nCHARLOTTE If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own. \nMARION I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel. \nHe stares past her, looking at the flames in the fireplace.  She tends his wounds. \nEXT.  PORCH - CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - MORNING \nMarion and Gabriel finish saddling their horses.  Marion embraces Nathan and Samuel.  Then he turns to Margaret, William and Susan. \nWILLIAM When will you be back? \nMARION I don't know, William. \nWILLIAM Tomorrow? \nMarion winces.  Margaret puts her arm around William. \nMARGARET No, not tomorrow. \nMarion kisses them both, then moves on to Susan, trying to coax a word out of the silent four-year-old: \nMARION Goodbye? \nShe just looks at him. \nMARION Just one word?  Goodbye?  That's all I want. \nSusan shakes her head.  He sighs, rises and turns to Charlotte.  They hesitate, then embrace, hugging deeply but a bit awkwardly, holding each other just a moment longer than one would expect.  She looks up at him... he kisses her on the cheek. \nMarion mounts up.  And he and Gabriel head off, Susan, unnoticed and unheard, whispers: \nSUSAN Goodbye. \nMarion and Gabriel ride away. \nEXT.  CAMDEN ROAD - DAY \nMarion and Gabriel ride past the signs of a small skirmish.  Bodies.  Abandoned wagons.  Dead horses.  A burning farm. \nEXT.  CAMDEN HILLSIDE - DAY \nMarion and Gabriel ride to the crest of a hill.  A vista spreads out before them.  They see an awesome sight -- A MASSIVE SLASH OF RED approaches a MASSIVE SLASH OF BLUE. A battle is taking place about five miles away. \nGabriel starts to spur his horse but Marion restrains him. \nMARION No, it's too late. \nGabriel stops.  Marion points out brightly colored clusters of men behind each army. \nMARION Command posts... Patriot... British... \nThe distant slash of red stops.  Marion and Gabriel hear only a GENTLE WIND and some nearby SONGBIRDS. \nThen, from a black mass of the side of the red slash, a sudden, silent eruption of white smoke. \nAn instant later, the blue slash quivers.  A moment later the SOUND OF THE CANNONS, RUMBLES UP THE HILL and rolls over Marion and Gabriel. \nThe RED SLASH STOPS moving.  It darkens as thousands of Redcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneel into firing position. \nMarion's eyes dart.  He knows what's coming. \nMARION Break for the trees... break for the trees... \nA MASSIVE ERUPTION OF WHITE SMOKE billows from the red slash.  An instant later, the blue line starts to break up as hundreds of distant Patriots fall. \nThe SOUND OF THE BRITISH MUSKETS reaches Marion and Gabriel like the pattering of rain. \nThen the SMOKE OF INEFFECTIVE, SCATTERED VOLLEYS erupts from the Patriot lines.  The red line holds firm. \nMARION Send them to cover!  Goddamn you! \nBut the blue line of the Patriots stays in the open field. \nFrom behind the Redcoats, FAST-MOVING GREEN AND RED MASSES move quickly onto the battlefield.  CAVALRY. \nGABRIEL Father, we have to do something... \nThe British cavalry slams into the blue line, shattering it.  Tiny bits of blue move in every direction. \nGABRIEL Father... \nMARION It's already over. \nMarion watches, appalled.  At this distance the moving slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely beautiful.  Marion turns his horse and heads down the hill, toward the rear of the Patriot lines. \nEXT.  AMERICAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nA nightmare.  SCREAMS OF AGONY.  A few hundred battered, Patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move out.  The battle, so bloodless and beautiful at a distance, has, in its aftermath, become horrifically painful and ugly. \nMarion and Gabriel ride into camp, passing nervous sentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by pools of blood and amputated legs and arms.  Marion sees HARRY LEE at a make-shift command post, barking orders, trying to pull things together. \nGABRIEL I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston. \nMARION Is that so? \nGABRIEL Yes, sir. (beat) My father taught me. \nMarion looks at Gabriel closely. \nMARION Did your father teach you humility? \nGABRIEL He tried.  It didn't take. \nMarion looks Gabriel up and down. \nMARION Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island. \nGABRIEL Yes, sir. \nThey mount up. \nMARION And, Corporal... (beat) ... be careful. \nGABRIEL Yes... (beat) ... father. \nThey ride off in different directions. \nEXT.  BRADFORD VILLAGE - NIGHT \nMarion rides into a small village, passing several bodies in blue Continental uniforms, hanging from lampposts. Marion stops in front of a tavern, dismounts and enters. \nINT.  TAVERN - BRADFORD - NIGHT \nAs Marion walks in he's greeted by cold stares from half- a-dozen men, huddles over their drinks. \nMARION I'm looking for John Billings. \nBARTENDER He's dead. \nMarion looks closely at the grim, suspicious men. \nMARION If he comes back from the dead, tell him Francis Marion is looking for him. \nBARTENDER I'll be sure to do that. \nAs Marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of Madeira on one of the tables.  He stops. \nMARION I'll wait.  Miracles happen. \nA stand-off.  Then, a hulking FIGURE appears in the shadows at the back doorway.  He's JOHN BILLINGS, big, coarse, about Marion's age.  Billings jerks his head for Marion to join him in the back room. \nINT.  BACK ROOM - TAVERN - NIGHT \nDark.  Marion and billings talk over a bottle. \nBILLINGS You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia? \nMARION I expect to try. \nBILLINGS Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis? \nMARION It worked.  How many men can you raise? \nBILLINGS Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose... (beat) What about you?  You've got a lot to lose. \nMarion drains his glass and stands up. \nMARION You coming, or not? \nBillings drains his glass.  They walk out together. \nEXT.  TAVERN - BRADFORD - NIGHT \nMarion and Billings ride away from the tavern, passing the hanging Patriot bodies. \nEXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - SANTEE SWAMPS - NIGHT \nA CACOPHONY OF BIRDS AND INSECTS.  Swamp maples and willows form a canopy over moss-covered mounds and pools of plant-choked water. \nGabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path that snakes through the swamp.  They cross a narrow land bridge onto a wooded island, joining a dozen-and-a-half men, including Marion who kneels at a campfire. \nCLOSE SHOT:  Several of Thomas' brightly painted LEAD SOLDIERS MELT in a cast-iron pan.  The little men fall to their knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten metal. \nThe new arrivals dismount and greet the others. \nGabriel steps up behind Marion and watches as he pours the lead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the mold into a bucket of water which HISSES and STEAMS. \nGABRIEL Father, this war is about more than Thomas. \nMarion doesn't look up. \nMARION Is it? \nGABRIEL If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself. \nMARION How old are you? \nGABRIEL You know how old I am. \nMARION God help us all when you're forty. \nMarion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan.  Gabriel shakes his head, turns away and goes to tend his horse. \nEXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND ENCAMPMENT - MORNING \nDay breaks.  A low, thick swamp mist covers the encampment.  Marion, sits alone by the embers of last night's campfire.  The men are awake.  Some eat, others talk. \nMarion pulls himself out of his dark reverie.  He takes the bullets from the mold and puts them in a pouch attached to his weapons' belt.  Then he rises and heads over to the men. \nGABRIEL Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear. \nMARION Flanking riders? \nGABRIEL I didn't see any. \nMarion nods and motions to his men who check their weapons and pass the word.  Gabriel ties up his horse and takes a position near his father. \nEXT.  SANTEE ROAD - NIGHT \nThe British convoy rounds the curve.  When two-thirds of the wagons have crossed the bridge, Marion FIRES, killing the Redcoat of highest rank, a CAPTAIN. \nBILLINGS AND DALTON heave CORKED BOTTLES which break, spreading their OILY CONTENTS on the wooden bridge. \nBROTHER JOSEPH fires a FLAMING ARROW, igniting the oil. \nThe BRIDGE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, cutting off the tail of the convoy, stranding a dozen wagons and the herd of horses on Marion's side of the river. \nA REDCOAT LIEUTENANT takes command. \nREDCOAT LIEUTENANT Across the river!  Covering fire! Double rank! \nMarion calls to his men. \nMARION Epaulets first... Kill the officers. \nMarion and his men FIRE A WITHERING VOLLEY, KILLING ALL REDCOATS OF RANK -- two lieutenants, a sergeant and several corporals. \nThe LEADERLESS REDCOAT PRIVATES take cover as Marion's men OPEN UP on the Redcoats on their side of the river. \nMARION THE WAGONS! \nWith half of his men FIRING COVER, Marion and the other half run to the wagons, passing Redcoat dead and wounded... \nDALTON, notices a WOUNDED REDCOAT and pauses... \nThe Redcoat looks up imploringly at Dalton who finishes reloading, then coldly FIRES, KILLING THE helpless Redcoat... \nMarion, Gabriel and Rev. Oliver see Dalton kill the wounded Redcoat as they race toward the wagons, British musketballs SPLINTERING TREES all around them... \nThe horses nearest the burning bridge are terrified, BUCKING AND REARING, STRUGGLING in their traces... \nMARION LEAPS INTO THE SEAT of one wagon.  Gabriel and Billings grab the reins of two more wagons. \nThe Redcoats keep up a STEADY FIRE.  TWO OF MARION'S MEN FALL, one dead another wounded. \nMarion, Gabriel and Billings STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THE FRIGHTENED HORSES, backing them up around the curve to the cover of the woods. \nMARION'S REARGUARD, Brother Joseph, Abner, Dan Scott and others, withdraws in leapfrog, FIRING BACK ACROSS THE RIVER. \nBRITISH MUSKET BALLS SLAM into the trees and SPLINTER THE WAGONS... \nAnother of Marion's men is WOUNDED.  Two of his comrades HEAVE HIM onto one of the wagons... \nAs Marion's men get the wagons turned and unblocked from each other, they DRIVE THEM OFF, one after another... \nBrother Joseph, Abner and the rest of the rearguard make it to Marion and LEAP INTO HIS WAGON... \nMARION snaps the reins and they THUNDER OFF, away from the BURNING BRIDGE and the FIRING Redcoats. \nEXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - DAY \nMarion's men tend their wounded and look through the British wagons, taking inventory. \nREV. OLIVER ... two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess muskets, forty-one casks of powder, balls, tamping... \nBILLINGS We have enough arms for an army. Now all we need is an army. \nMarion checks out a wagon full of tools with DAN SCOTT and ROB FIELDING, a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen.  They overlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language of colonial artisans. \nSCOTT Reamer, boring tool... \nMARION Swage, broach, etching tool... \nFIELDING A rolling gunsmith's shop... \nSCOTT We can rifle those musket barrels... \nFIELDING Get another hundred yards out of 'em... \nMARION We'll need a forge... \nSCOTT Easy enough... \nMARION We've got clay to make a chamber... \nFIELDING Oak to make charcoal... \nSCOTT Oil cloth and barrel staves to make a bellows... \nMARION And we can yank a wagon wheel, weight it, rig a piston and drive shaft and we'll have a flywheel to power the bellows... \nScott and Fielding exchange an impressed look. \nSCOTT (to Fielding) That's why he's a colonel. \nScott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work. Marion hears a COMMOTION OF BARKING DOGS AND YELLING MEN and strides over to find Billings cowering before TWO HUGE GREAT DANES who stand guard at one of the wagons. \nBILLINGS Shoot them!  Shoot the damn things! \nDalton prepares to do so. \nMARION Put that pistol down! \nSCOTT They followed us from the bridge. They won't let anyone near the wagon. \nMarion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to the dogs. \nMarion reads Cornwallis' journal.  He looks up, stretches and walks over to a campfire where Gabriel, Billings and Rev. Oliver cook.  The dogs follow at a distance. \nBILLINGS Well? \nMARION I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes. \nBILLINGS Cheerful news to greet the morn. \nMARION His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness. \nThey all turn to Marion. \nMARION Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it. \nGABRIEL Father? \nMARION Pride is his weakness. \nThe men consider that. \nBILLINGS Personally, I'd prefer stupidity. \nMARION Pride will do. \nBEGIN MONTAGE:  Series of shots as follows: \n-- A VOLLEY OF MUSKET FIRE erupts from some thick underbrush, cutting down half of a squadron of Redcoats on the march.  The surviving Redcoats FIRE BACK into the trees at unseen targets to little effect. \n-- Marion rides with about fifty men. \n-- A British supply convoy makes its way through the woods.  Suddenly, Marion's men appear, rising up from the ground as if by magic, having been camouflaged by leaves and brush.  They OPEN FIRE on the convoy escort, which holds for a moment, then flees. \n-- Marion rides with about seventy-five men. \n-- Cornwallis finishes reading a dispatch and furiously flings it across the room. \n-- Marion rides with about one hundred men. \n-- Snow's Island.  Marion and his men do an inventory of a large haul of stolen British supply wagons.  The booty includes dozens of BRASS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, some of which Marion's men BLARE in celebration. \n-- Marion rides with about one-hundred-fifty men. \n-- Marion, Gabriel, and some of the other men watch as the flaming supports of a BURNING WOODEN BRIDGE collapse into a river. \n-- A seething Cornwallis stands at the same spot, looking at the charred, now cooled, remains of the bridge. Cornwallis angrily mounts up and rides off.  His contrite staff officers mount up and follow. \n-- Snow's Island.  Marion sits with his muddy feet on Cornwallis' campaign desk, reading Cornwallis' journal, with Cornwallis' Great Danes at his side. \nEXT.  CAMDEN - NIGHT \nGlittering lights shine from the Camden Inn, a grand structure in the center of town. \nA line of OPULENT CARRIAGES discharges well-dressed passengers, arriving for a ball.  Ladies in their finery. Patrician husbands.  Redcoat and Green Dragoon officers in magnificent dress uniforms. \nINT.  CORNWALLIS' PERSONAL QUARTERS - EVENING \nCornwallis, standing in front of a full-length mirror, is dressed by his VALET while Major Halbert, Colonel Huntington and Tarleton look on. \nCORNWALLIS Why am I here, Colonel Halbert? \nMAJOR HALBERT For the ball, sir? \nCornwallis holds his temper. \nCORNWALLIS Why, after six weeks, are we still here to attend a ball.  By now, we should be attending balls in North Carolina, not South Carolina. \nMAJOR HALBERT Our supply line, sir? \nCORNWALLIS Excellent guess, Major. \nThe valet puts a dress coat on Cornwallis who looks at the garment with deepest disdain. \nCORNWALLIS And what, praytell, is this? \nVALET Uh... I borrowed it from Colonel North.  I took it in at the back, added wider epaulets, a court sash and looped gold braiding on the cuffs... \nCORNWALLIS It's a horse blanket. (to Major Halbert) First my personal baggage, then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charleston burned, a dozen convoys attacked.  Colonel, if you can't secure our supply line against militia, how do you expect to do so against Colonial regulars or the French when they come? \nCOLONEL HALBERT Sir, they're not like regulars, we can't find them and we don't know when or where they're going to strike. \nCORNWALLIS How impolite.  And who leads these clever, secretive fellows? \nCOLONEL HALBERT We don't know, sir.  He's called, the Commander by some, the Swamp Fox by others. \nCORNWALLIS Colonel, I'm a civilized man but I'm finding to difficult to remain civil.  Secure my supply line. \nCOLONEL HALBERT Yes, sir. \nCornwallis looks at his reflection with dismay, sighs and strides out.  Tarleton, amused, follows. \nEXT.  CAMDEN STREET - NIGHT \nAt the far end of town Marion, Gabriel, Billings, Dalton, Scott and several other men slip through the shadows into an alley.  The lights from the ball shine from down the street and the MUSICAL STRAINS of a MINUET drift to them through the night. \nEXT.  ARMORY - NIGHT \nA block-like building on the far edge of town.  A pair of REDCOATS stand guard.  A PAIR OF DRUNKEN REDCOATS stagger out of a side-street, SINGING A MUMBLING SONG.  The Redcoat guards look at the drunk Redcoats enviously. \nREDCOAT GUARD Hey, what you got there? \nThe drunken Redcoats look up, bringing their faces into the light -- THE DRUNKEN REDCOATS ARE BILLINGS AND DALTON. \nBILLINGS We got our own little party... \nDALTON To hell with the officers and their fancy dress ball... \nGUARD Give us a nip, here. \nMarion takes a last look in the direction of the departing Tarleton.  Then he dismounts and hurries over to help the wounded.  Gabriel watches his father for a moment, then joins him with the wounded. \nEXT.  WOODED GLEN - NIGHT \nDark.  Marion and his battered men gather, taking stock. Men drift in, mounted and on foot in ones and twos, past wary sentries.  GABRIEL RIDES UP, dismounts and reports to Marion, out of earshot of the other men. \nGABRIEL Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured. \nMARION I should have killed him when I had the chance? \nGABRIEL When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family? \nMARION No... \nGABRIEL Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause. \nMarion is silent. \nGABRIEL There will be a time and a place for revenge but killing Tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one but yourself. (beat) Stay the course. \nThe parental-sounding formality of Gabriel's words brings a thin smile to Marion's face. \nMARION Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper. \nGABRIEL She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan. \nMARION You learned her lessons better than I. \nGABRIEL She got me at a more impressionable age. \nMarion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and heads over to help with the wounded. \nEXT.  MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nA cold, winter rain falls.  Most of Marion's grim men are huddled in lean-to's and around campfires.  Green and several other Pembroke townspeople unload a wagon of supplies while Marion, Scott and Fielding stow the provisions. \nGabriel and Anne sit at a fire, under the cover of a lean- to, taking quietly.  He's troubled.  She tries to be hopeful. \nANNE Next time we'll bring more blankets. \nGABRIEL That would be nice. \nANNE Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow. \nGABRIEL That would be nice, too. \nShe takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of tea. \nANNE Just because the French didn't come this fall, doesn't mean they're never going to come. \nHe nods and takes a drink of the tea.  She smiles. Gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink- stained, black teeth.  Before she has time to laugh... \nROLLINS RIDES HARD INTO CAMP.  Marion hurries over, accompanied by the Great Danes.  The other men gather around. \nROLLINS They're to be hung! \nGABRIEL But they're prisoners-of-war! \nMarion isn't as surprised as Gabriel.  He is, however, taken aback by Gabriel's black teeth.  Gabriel notices everyone looking at his mouth. \nAnne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly in the face of the troubling news. \nEXT.  FORT CAROLINA - DAY \nA REDCOAT SENTRY sees a lone figure on horseback ride out of distant woods.  It's Rev. Oliver, carrying a white flag with one hand, holding a dispatch case in the other.  The sentry calls to the Commander of the Watch. \nREDCOAT SENTRY Sir. \nINT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAY \nA temporary HQ has been set up in a commandeered farmhouse.  Cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor measures him and marks alterations on a partially completed uniform.  Tarleton enters. \nTARLETON General, a message from the commander of the rebel militia. \nCornwallis reads the message. \nCORNWALLIS It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley. \nTARLETON Are you going to meet with him? \nCORNWALLIS Most certainly.  Arrange it. \nEXT.  CAROLINA ROAD - DAY \nMarion rides, trailed by Cornwallis' Great Danes.  Behind him, two dozen heavily armed Patriots, including Rev. Oliver who carries a white flag. \nA detachment of Redcoat Cavalry, lead by Major Halbert, waits.  The Redcoats fall in on either side.  They ride on. \nEXT.  FORT CAROLINA - DAY \nRedcoat sentries see the approaching Patriots and Redcoats and open the gates.  Billings and the other Patriots stop, a hundred yards outside the barricades. \nMARION alone rides through the gates, flanked by the British cavalry, the Great Danes following closely behind. \nINT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nMajor Halbert ushers Marion in.  The Great Danes follow sniffing curiously, sensing something or someone. \nMAJOR HALBERT Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently. \nMARION Thank you. \nMAJOR HALBERT You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that... \nMARION (interrupting) I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley. \nMAJOR HALBERT Yes, quite, but you should know that... \nMARION As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement. (beat) And my men are excellent marksmen. \nCornwallis sighs. \nCORNWALLIS Very well, let us move on to... \nMARION Prisoner exchange. \nCORNWALLIS Sir? \nMARION You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back. \nCORNWALLIS I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war. \nMARION If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men. \nCORNWALLIS What officers? \nMarion steps to the window, checks the view.  A wooded hillside is visible in the distance.  Marion reaches into his jacket... \nThe Dragoons move on him... \nMarion extracts not a weapon, but a spyglass, which he hands to Cornwallis. \nMARION In the clearing, just down from the crest, to the left of the dark pines... \nCornwallis looks through the spyglass. \nVIEW THROUGH THE SPYGLASS \nThough difficult to see clearly through the shimmering haze, Cornwallis can just make out a row of bound Redcoat officers, with Patriot soldiers holding muskets at their heads. \nCORNWALLIS turns coldly to Marion. \nCORNWALLIS Their names, ranks and posts? \nMARION They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night. \nCornwallis glares at Marion. \nCORNWALLIS You are not a gentleman. \nMarion can't help but laugh at the insult. \nMARION If your conduct is the measure of a gentleman, I take that as a compliment. (coldly) Get my men. \nCornwallis turns to Colonel Huntington. \nCORNWALLIS Arrange the exchange. \nColonel Huntington leaves to do so. \nMARION Thank you, General.  I'm sure your officers will thank you, as well. \nMarion salutes Cornwallis who doesn't return the salute. \nTHEN MARION TURNS TO TARLETON.  He walks up to him and looks him in the eye. \nMARION You don't remember me, do you? \nTarleton examines Marion's face, finding him familiar, but unable to place him... then Tarleton remembers... \nTARLETON Ah, yes, that boy. \nTarleton calmly holds Marion's glare. \nTARLETON Ugly business, doing one's duty. \nMARION Yes, ugly business. \nMarion takes a step closer to Tarleton, then speaks very softly, very slowly, very clearly. \nMARION If you are alive when this war is over, I'm going to kill you. \nMarion locks his eyes on Tarleton to make it perfectly clear that he means what he says.  Tarleton tries to cover his reaction but it's apparent that he's taken aback by Marion's icy words. \nMarion turns and walks out.  The two Great Danes start to follow, but Cornwallis SNAPS A COMMAND: \nCORNWALLIS Jupiter!  Mars! \nTHE DOGS FREEZE, looking after Marion, who doesn't turn back.  The dogs reluctantly sidle over to Cornwallis' side. \nEXT.  ASSEMBLY YARD - FORT CAROLINA - DAY \nRedcoats glare at Marion who sits, mounted, waiting.  His eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and directed to waiting horses.  Surprised to be freed, they mount up. \nCORNWALLIS AND TARLETON step out onto the front porch of Cornwallis' headquarters and watch as Marion and his men ride toward the gate. \nTHE TWO GREAT DANES, watch Marion from Cornwallis' side. \nCornwallis motions to the Redcoat Sentries to OPEN THE GATES.  They do so and Marion and his men, without hurrying, ride out. \nThen, just as the gates are closing behind him, Marion, without turning around, lets loose with a PIERCING WHISTLE... \nTHE TWO GREAT DANES INSTANTLY RACE AFTER MARION, making it through the gates just as they're closing. \nCORNWALLIS, seeing his dogs run after Marion, SPUTTERS, then turns and storms back into his quarters. \nTARLETON, still off-balance from Marion's parting statement, watches Marion ride away.  Then he turns to Major Wilkins who stands nearby. \nTARLETON Take a detachment and go get our officers. \nWilkins hurries off. \nEXT.  HILLSIDE CLEARING - ABOVE FORT CAROLINA - DAY \nMajor Wilkins and a detachment of Green Dragoons ride up the wooded slope toward the bound Redcoat officers that Cornwallis saw through the spyglass.  As the Dragoons ride out of the trees into the clearing they stop dead, seeing that: \nMarion, at the head of the rest of the brigade, waits next to an increasingly frantic, Rollins.  They see Gabriel wave, signaling all clear. \nMARION, ROLLINS AND THE OTHER MEN RIDE to the house. Rollins is the first to see THE BODIES.  Horrified, he reins back and dismounts, almost falling. \nHis TWO SONS, WIFE, an OLDER MAN and WOMAN, lie dead in the dirt.  Marion's men silently watch Rollins' agony. Weeping and confused, he moves in a mad, staccato manner, as if he were a marionette, whose strings were being jerked by a drunken puppeteer. \nMarion and Rev. Oliver dismount and move toward him. Rollins sees them coming.  He hardens and strides to his horse, pulling his FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his saddle holster. \nRev. Oliver reaches out to embrace Rollins. \nREV. OLIVER It's not time for vengeance, it's time to mourn and... \nROLLINS PUTS THE PISTOL TO HIS HEAD AND PULLS THE TRIGGER, BLOWING HIS BRAINS OUT. \nEvery man freezes in place.  For a long moment no one moves, no one speaks.  Then Marion pulls himself together and addresses the men: \nMARION Five day furlough for all men. Abner, Dan, Reverend, spread the word.  We'll reform at Acworth.  Any man who doesn't come back won't be thought a coward or uncommitted to the cause.  Attend to your families. \nThe men mount up.  Marion and Gabriel ride off together. \nEXT.  PEMBROKE - NIGHT \nMarion scans the night as Gabriel and Anne mount up.  The three of them ride off, pulling a line of horses, some heavily loaded packhorses and some saddled but empty mounts. \nEXT.  SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT \nDark.  Quiet.  Gabriel and Anne wait in the shadows while Marion cocks his musket, checks his pistols and walks slowly toward the shack. \nHe warily checks every shadow.  No one anywhere.  Then a SOUND -- A SQUEAL OF LAUGHTER, immediately followed by: \nMARGARET (O.S.) It's him!  I told you it was him! \nMARION'S CHILDREN RACE OUT OF THE SHADOWS to Marion.  He's practically bowled over as Margaret, Nathan, Samuel and William fling themselves into his arms. \nNATHAN Father! \nWILLIAM Papa... \nCHARLOTTE STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS, watching the reunion as Marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hug all of them at once as they cling to him as if they'll never let go.  MARION AND CHARLOTTE LOCK EYES over the heads of the children. \nMARION Thank you. \nCharlotte smiles.  Then Marion notices SUSAN peeking out from behind Charlotte's patched and mended skirt.  He kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesn't move. \nHe smiles to her and speaks softly: \nMARION Susan... \nShe looks coldly at Marion, tightens her grip on Charlotte's skirt and retreats further behind her.  Marion looks to Charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance. Then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces of his other children. \nEXT.  CHERAW FALLS PATH - NIGHT \nMarion rides, leading his children, Charlotte and Anne up a steep, narrow path that cuts through a heavily wooded hillside. \nEXT.  CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT \nThe remains of a tiny abandoned backcountry farm.  The house is gone, leaving only an overgrown cellar hole. \nNearby is a barely-standing tobacco shed, one end of which has fallen to the ground.  A SOFT WIND WHISTLES AND WHISPERS through the gaps in the rough-hewn boards of the structure. \nMarion rides up to the edge of the clearing.  A MOCKINGBIRD SCREECHES nearby, startling him.  He looks back at the children, worried, anticipating a negative reaction.  Margaret smiles and turns to the other children, speaking for Marion's benefit. \nMARGARET I told you, things would get better. \nThe children smile and dismount. \nINT.  TOBACCO SHED - NIGHT \nPOURING RAIN.  The ceiling drips.  Marion lies, awake, with his children huddled against him, sleeping in one of the few dry spots.  They're covered with tattered quilts. \nOn the other side of the children, Charlotte is also awake.  She and Marion exchange a long, silent look in the darkness, over the heads of the sleeping children. \nEXT.  WATERFALL OVERLOOK - DAY \nMarion walks the perimeter of their encampment with Nathan and Samuel.  They listen carefully. \nMARION The overlook, up there should be where you post the watch.  Work out a schedule.  Short watches, especially at night. (pointing) If you can catch some of those mockingbirds you can make cages and put them along there for alarms. (motioning for them to follow) Now let's find someplace to cache extra weapons... \nThey follow Marion like soldiers. \nEXT.  CHERAW FALLS - DAY \nMarion sits on a rock while Margaret cuts his hair.  She takes her time, touching him on the head and shoulders, extending the process.  Marion, sits back, enjoying it. He notices Susan, nearby, watching silently.  He smiles. She turns away. \nEXT.  TOBACCO SHED - CHERAW FALLS - DAY \nDark.  Shafts of light shine in through the holes in the roof.  Marion, standing in the shadows, senses someone coming.  He freezes. \nA figure rounds the corner.  It's... William.  MARION YELLS William SQUEALS IN DELIGHT, then chases his father around the corner, tagging him.  They laugh.  Marion covers his eyes and William dashes off to hide. \nEXT.  CHERAW FALLS - RIVERSIDE - DAY \nMarion sits on the side of the river with Susan who avoids looking at him.  Using the knife we've seen him use in battle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them. \nMARION Good apple. \nNo response. \nMARION Very good.  Sweet. \nHe cuts a slice and offers it to her.  She doesn't take it.  He puts the slice between them.  After a long moment she picks it up but as she's about to eat it, she stops, seeing something on it.  She puts it back. \nMarion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red splotch on it.  He looks at his knife and realizes that it's dried blood. \nOff-balance, he turns to Susan who stares straight ahead, a thousand miles from Marion. \nEXT.  CHERAW FALLS RIVER - DAY \nMarion spurs his horse straight toward her, GALLOPING toward the running, crying child. \nSUSAN Please, Papa, please don't go. \nMARION RIDES TOWARD HER... \nCharlotte, Anne and Marion's children watch as: \nMARION LEANS OVER IN THE SADDLE without slowing down... \nSWOOPING HER INTO HIS LAP... \nShe sits astride the saddle, facing him, her arms wrapped around him, pleading, the words tumbling from her, as fast as she can get them out... \nSUSAN ... I'll talk to you, I'll say anything you want, just tell me what you want me to say, I'll say anything, I promise, please, Papa, just stay... \nMarion envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl, holding her, letting her cry, fighting his own tears... \nHe reins back the horse, stopping in front of the others... \nHe pleadingly looks to Charlotte who steps up to the horse... to take Susan... \nMarion gives Susan a final embrace, and covers her face with kisses... \nMARION I'll come back... I promise... \nMarion hands the still crying Susan down to Charlotte... \nMarion, in agony, averts his eyes, yanks his reins, and spurs his horse... \nAs he rides away the children take off after him, running. \nSusan seeing the others running after Marion, struggles out of Charlotte's arms, and runs after them as well... \nMarion rides, now joined by Gabriel, faster and faster, leaving a trail of dust... \nThe children slow, then stop, one after another, watching as they ride away. \nEXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - ACWORTH - EVENING \nGrim.  The most rudimentary of the encampments we've seen. Rain pours.  Some of Marion's men huddle under lean-to's and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial protection from the cold rain. \nAbner and Scott do their best to keep a wet-wood fire going.  Rev. Oliver tries to cook. \nMarion and Gabriel ride up and dismount.  Marion joins Rev. Oliver. \nMARION How many came back? \nREV. OLIVER About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third. \nMarion nods.  He and Gabriel join some of the men under one of the lean-to's. \nEXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY \nThe rain has stopped.  The ground is still wet.  It's spring.  The first buds are on the maple trees.  A fox tentatively comes out of its winter den, followed by a pair of pups. \nMarion stands on the side of a river, looking up at a chevron of Canadian geese flying north. \nEXT.  PEMBROKE - DAY \nThe Canadian Geese fly over Anne who is behind her father's store, tying food and provisions to a couple of packhorses.  A mare and a foal cavort in a nearby paddock. \nSuddenly Anne senses someone behind her and turns to see HALF-A DOZEN REDCOATS.  She's initially frightened but the REDCOAT SERGEANT, speaks politely. \nREDCOAT SERGEANT Excuse me, Ma'am, everyone has been requested to gather at the church. \nANNE Everyone? \nREDCOAT SERGEANT Colonel Tarleton wants to address, the whole village. \nThe Redcoat Sergeant deferentially motions for Anne to follow him and his men.  She sees several other townspeople, with Redcoat escorts, already heading down the street.  She follows along. \nEXT.  PEMBROKE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY \nTarleton and Wilkins, on horseback, watch as a large, mixed detachment of Green Dragoons and Redcoat Infantry directs the villagers into the church. \nOne of the Redcoats walks out of the general store with a bowl of gumdrops.  As he starts giving them to a few of the children their parents waver, unsure of the gesture, but they reluctantly allow the children to take the candy. \nThe townspeople are uneasy but they follow the orders of the Redcoats who, though carry muskets, are polite and unthreatening. \nREDCOAT Into the church, please. \nANOTHER REDCOAT Colonel Tarleton wishes to address all of you. \nTarleton sees the last of the townspeople enter the church.  He nods to the Redcoats near the door. \nThe Redcoats CLOSE THE DOORS, chaining them shut.  The DOOR IS POUNDED ON from the inside. \nVOICE Open this door! \nANOTHER VOICE By what right are we made prisoners? \nTARLETON NODS TO GASKINS who, along with several rough- looking LOYALIST MILITIAMEN, disappear into the blacksmith shop.  They reappear a moment later with FLAMING TORCHES and approach the church. \nSeveral Redcoats see what's about to happen and are appalled.  Even some of the Green Dragoons, including Wilkins, are troubled.  Wilkins rides over to Tarleton. \nWILKINS Sir? \nTARLETON Yes, Major. \nGaskins and the Loyalist Militia stop around the church, torches ready, waiting for the final go-ahead from Tarleton.  The POUNDING AND CALLING from inside the church grows louder. \nWILKINS Sir, there is no honor in this. \nTARLETON The honor is found in the end, not the means.  This will be forgotten. (to Gaskins) Proceed. \nThe Redcoats turn to the Redcoat Officers.  The Redcoat officers turn to Wilkins, who struggles with himself. Tarleton calmly watches Wilkins' distress. \nMarion shakes his head to himself. \nMARION That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect. \nGABRIEL I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing. \nMarion's quiet for a moment.  Then he speaks: \nMARION It was in '63.  It was a bad time. The French and the Cherokee had raided along the Blue Ridge.  All the English settlers took refuge at Fort Wilderness but the French captured it.  We were sent in relief.  Harry Lee, Billings, sixty of us.  We already had something of a reputation for being... harsh. When we got there the fort was abandoned.  Not a French soldier or Cherokee anywhere.  They had left a week earlier.  What we found was... bad. \nMarion grows quieter with the memory of how bad. \nMARION They had left the settlers there. The men had been burned alive, the women were in pieces and the children were on stakes. \nMarion's silent for a moment. \nMARION We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford. \nGABRIEL Go on. \nMARION We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon. (beat) The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee. (beat) The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight. (beat) That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks. \nGabriel is silent.  Marion looks at him closely. \nMARION It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that. \nGABRIEL I see, do as I say, not as I do. \nMARION Yes. \nThey hear HORSES HOOVES.  Abner rides in from the opposite side of the village from the church, not having seen the results of the massacre.  Excited, he dismounts. \nABNER THEY'RE HERE!  CONTINENTALS, THEY'RE HERE! \nMarion and Gabriel just look at him.  Abner is confused by their reaction.  Then he sees the remains of the church and the laid out, charred bodies. \nEXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nMixed gatherings of Marion's militia and Continentals are clustered around the campfires, with more Continentals arriving all the time. \nSome of the militiamen and regulars regale each other with tales of their exploits but most are grim and tired, talking quietly. \nA couple of Patriots play a MELANCHOLY TUNE ON FIFE AND VIOLIN. \nMarion's tent is set up but he's nowhere to be seen. Gabriel walks to Marion's gear.  Finding Marion's weapon's belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the paint-flecked MUSKET BALLS MADE FROM THOMAS' LEAD SOLDIERS.  As Gabriel takes one, Marion steps up behind him. \nMARION If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course. \nGABRIEL As you did at Fort Wilderness? \nBefore Marion can answer they see HARRY LEE RIDE UP TO THEM.  He dismounts, excited, voluble.  He strides over, pleased to see Marion, oblivious to his and Gabriel's mood. \nLEE Look at you!  I knew you could do it! \nLee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull. \nLEE We have a chance!  Better than a chance!  Cornwallis is running to the Chesapeake, probably to meet his fleet at Yorktown.  I wish I could see his face when he sees a dozen French ships floating there.  And Washington should be a day or two behind him. (beat) And on top of everything, I have a son!  Born last month in Alexandria. \nGabriel rises and walks away.  Lee finally tunes into the pall hanging over Marion and the just departed Gabriel. He turns to Marion. \nMARION His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child. \nLEE I'm sorry, I didn't know. \nMarion nods.  They stand in silence.  Lee hands Marion the bottle.  He takes a drink. \nEXT.  ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nDark.  Quiet.  Sentries are on duty.  Marion's tent glows from a single candle.  He blows the candle out, then steps out of the tent into the night. \nHe begins his nightly walk of the perimeter. \nAlmost immediately, Marion notices something amiss. Dalton has discovered it at the same time and hurries over to Marion. \nAT ONE OF THE CAMPSITES \nMarion and Dalton and several of the other men look down at some empty bedrolls. \nDALTON Gabriel and at least a dozen others. They must have left right after the watch change. \nMARION That means they have two hours on us. \nMarion strides to his horse.  The other men follow him. \nEXT.  WOODED ROAD - NIGHT \nMarion, Dalton and Rev. Oliver and two dozen other men ride. \nEXT.  WOODED ROAD - NIGHT \nDark.  Very quiet.  A moonless night.  Marion and his men, on foot, make their way along the side of the river. Brother Joseph hurries out of the darkness and speaks to Marion. \nBROTHER JOSEPH Fifty Green Dragoons, camped about a quarter mile from here.  Sentries at four points. \nSuddenly they hear the SOUNDS OF MUSKETS FIRE ahead of them in the darkness.  Marion takes off at a full run with his men right behind. \nEXT.  OUTSKIRTS OF GREEN DRAGOON ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nMarion and his men BLAST THROUGH THE BRUSH.  Running toward the SOUNDS OF THE BATTLE, which grows louder with every step... \nMarion cocks his pistol and extracts his tomahawk on the run... \nThe LIGHTS OF THE BATTLE:  The STROBES OF THE MUSKET SHOTS illuminate the woods ahead of them... \nMoving fast, they PASS TWO DEAD BRITISH SENTRIES, without slowing down... \nTHEY BLAST OUT OF THE WOODS into... \nIN THE TENT \nMarion still sits.  A FLY BUZZES.  Gabriel's face has taken on a deathly, ashen look. \nLee enters the tent.  He's silent for a moment, then speaks softly to Marion. \nLEE You have to bury him. \nNo response. \nLEE I'll help you bury him. \nLee moves toward Gabriel's body. \nMARION Don't touch him. \nLEE How many men have we seen die? \nMARION Two.  Gabriel and Thomas. \nLEE They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this. \nMARION It is ended. \nLEE No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another. (beat) Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice. \nMarion doesn't respond.  Lee waits for a long moment, then he hears the SOUND OF THE DEPARTING TROOPS OUTSIDE THE TENT. \nHe looks at Marion, touches him on the shoulder and walks out. \nEXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - DAY \nThe last of the soldiers move out, leaving their smoldering campfires and refuse.  The only tent that remains is Marion's. \nEXT.  MARION'S TENT - DAY \nMarion sits in his tent, gazing obliquely at Gabriel's body which has grown even more ashen.  A SOLITARY BIRD CRIES in the distance. \nEXT.  WOODED ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nA dark, moonless night.  The sky is filled with stars.  A SOFT WIND BLOWS dead leaves along the ground.  A few of the leaves are blown through the opening of Marion's tent. \nINSIDE THE TENT \nMarion looks down, noticing the leaves, HEARING THE WIND. He listens for a moment.  Then he stands and walks out of the tent. \nOUTSIDE THE TENT \nMarion watches the leaves skittering along the ground.  He listens to the wind. \nThe HE LOOKS UP AT THE NIGHT SKY.  The stars are bright. His eyes are drawn to the Big Dipper and from there to the Little Dipper and the... \nNORTH STAR. \nHolding his eyes on the faint, but steady star, he gradually reorients himself.  He looks around at the abandoned encampment.  Then he looks into the tent and sees Gabriel's body.  The SOFT WIND BLOWS AROUND HIM. Marion nods in response. \nEXT.  BURIAL GROUND - WOODED ENCAMPMENT - MORNING \nMarion finishes burying Gabriel, putting the last shovelfuls of dirt on the freshly turned earth.  He stands next to the grave, looking down, and says a silent prayer. \nEXT.  YORKTOWN ROAD - DAY \nThe AMERICAN FORCES are on the move, all heading in the same direction.  Continentals and militiamen fill the road.  Some on horseback, others in wagons, most on foot. \nAmong them, a mixed unit of Continentals and Marion's brigade, at the head of which ride Lee, Dalton, Abner and Rev. Oliver. \nBehind them, a single horseman rides up.  It's MARION. Without speaking, Marion rides up alongside Lee.  They exchange nods. \nMarion rides between Dalton on one side and Rev. Oliver on the other.  They pass a sign that reads, \"Yorktown.  20 miles.\" \nEXT.  YORKTOWN OVERLOOK - DAY \nThe road to Yorktown skirts an OVERLOOK with a view of the town and the harbor.  A few dozen arriving Patriots have stopped to look out at the view.  Marion, Lee, Rev. Oliver and Dalton join them. \nThe French Fleet is visible in the harbor.  The British encampments are on a pair of peninsulas, one jutting out from land, the other jutting toward the land from a large island.  In a semi-circle around the landward peninsula, the beginnings of the Patriot encirclement are visible. It's a grand and impressive sight. \nMarion and the others turn their horses and head down the road toward the American lines. \nEXT.  YORKTOWN ENCAMPMENT - DAY \nAN INTERMITTENT EXCHANGE OF CANNON FIRE.  Not a battle, but pre-battle pot shots.  Behind the American embattlements, hundreds of American and French soldiers drill, make camp and build secondary fortifications. \nMARION, stands behind a barricade, trying to get a view of the British defenses.  A RUNNER, a boy about fifteen, dashes up to Marion. \nRUNNER You called for me, sir? \nMarion reaches into his pocket and pulls out a single WALNUT which he hands to the boy. \nMARION Take this to General Washington. \nThe boy looks at the walnut and then looks at Marion as if he's joking or crazy.  He's neither.  The boy shrugs and runs off with the walnut. \nEXT.  WASHINGTON'S HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN \nStaff officers.  Flags.  Tents.  French and American officers look over maps and sort out dispatches. Messengers, runners and dispatch riders come and go hurriedly. \nThe flap of the central HQ tent opens and GEORGE WASHINGTON steps out, followed by a pair of AIDES. Washington is tall and powerfully-built, an imposing man, worthy of respect. \nHe looks around and sees the awe-struck, slightly confused messenger boy, waiting nearby. \nWashington, holding the walnut in his hand, motions him over. \nWASHINGTON Did you bring me this? \nRUNNER Yes, sir. \nWashington scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to the boy. \nMarion closes the journal. \nMARION He has no respect for citizen soldiers.  That's your bait... militia. \nWashington nods, considering it. \nEXT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN - EVENING \nUnder fire.  Cornwallis and his staff.  Major Halbert strides in and gives Cornwallis a dispatch. \nMAJOR HALBERT Sir, a dispatch from General Clinton made it through the rebel lines. \nCornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it.  It staggers him.  He sits down. \nWILKINS Sir? \nCornwallis fumes.  His jaw sets with anger.  He slowly crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury. \nCORNWALLIS Call a general staff meeting. \nAIDE Yes, sir. \nEXT.  YORKTOWN - PRE-DAWN \nMarion stands at the American battlements, looking out at the British defensive works.  Above him, stars are visible, but they're fading in the light of the pre-dawn glow from the horizon. \nMarion scans the disappearing stars, searching out the NORTH STAR, but in the increasingly harsh light of this day, he can't find it.  He turns his eyes back to the battlefield. \nEXT.  YORKTOWN BATTLEFIELD - DAY \nThe sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility to a few dozen yards.  Men move like ghosts. \nTHE CAMERA finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist. There is no overview, just separate detachments: \nAn orderly regiment of CONTINENTAL CAVALRY, mounted, waiting, steadying their horses. \nTwo long lines of CONTINENTAL INFANTRY RESERVES... \nAn American Command, including Washington, LaFayette and two dozen staff officers, attended by riders and runners... \nAnd, finally, MARION AND HIS MEN, who stand in the middle of a long line of Patriot militia in the center of a long, valley-line depression. \nThey stand silently, unable to see anything other than each other and the gently slope of the dew-covered grass in front of them. \nThey're all grim.  They know what's coming. \nThen, the SOUND OF A SINGLE DRUM, heard but unseen, coming from over the slope... \nThen, MORE DRUMS, more and more, A COMPETITION OF DRUM BEATS... \nMarion's men listen, turning their heads, trying to imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in front of them. \nMARION MOTIONS FOR HIS OFFICERS, Dalton, Scott, Rev. Oliver and several other Patriot militia officers from other units.  They quickly gather around. \nMARION The British army believes in officers.  I believe in soldiers. After we engage, there will be no more orders.  Every man here must know what I'm about to tell you. \nThey listen closely. \nMARION We are the bait in a trap.  We're militia.  Cornwallis thinks we're rabble, nothing more than a bunch of undisciplined farmers.  And if he thinks that's what we are, that's what we're going to give him. Listen up. \nThey gather around closer. \nEXT.  BRITISH LINES - DAY \nCornwallis, surrounded by his staff officers, including Tarleton, stands on a low hill, trying, with the aid of a spyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as the morning mist begins to burn off. \nThrough the fog, he just makes out the American lines.  He turns to Tarleton who also peers through a spyglass. \nCORNWALLIS Do you see that, Colonel? \nTARLETON Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center. \nCornwallis and Tarleton exchange a pleased look. \nEXT.  LOW MEADOW - YORKTOWN - MORNING \nMarion and his men wait. \nA STRANGE SOUND.  Soft, muted.  The men turn their heads, listening, their eyes shifting. \nThey hear the SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON WET GRASS, advancing... \nTHE CAMERA WATCHES THE FACES OF MARION AND HIS MEN as they listen to an unseen army approaching. \nON MARION'S FACE we see him hearing every sound and we see FLASH CUTS of what he knows he's hearing: \nThe BOOTS OF THE UNSEEN SOLDIERS... \nShouldered muskets CLICKING against pack buckles... \nSILENCE at a stop... \nMORE DRUMS... \nThe men around Marion wait. \nTHEN, THEY SEE IT... \nA MASSIVE WALL OF RED appears over the rise in front of them... \nThousands of Redcoats, in perfect formation, marching in lockstep, straight for them. \nMarion sees the fear on his men's faces, but none of them move... \nThe BRITISH DRUMS GROW LOUDER AND LOUDER... it's almost enough to drive a man to flight... almost. \nThe CAMERA explores the faces of Marion's men, faces that we know, Rev. Oliver, Scott, Abner, Marion.  All are frightened but all are motionless. \nDALTON OUR LINE IS FALTERING... \nMarion takes a quick glance at the Continental line, seeing... \nScott, Rev. Oliver, Abner and a dozen more of his men, in the middle of a confused battle, with a larger mass of Redcoats who are advancing through the broken Continental line... \nMARION IS TORN... \nHe looks to Tarleton, seeing him distracted, vulnerable but too distant a target for the pistol... \nThen Marion looks to Rev. Oliver and the others... Dalton can't wait... he runs off... \nMarion wavers... \nThen he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to help the faltering Patriots... \nTARLETON sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees Marion himself, his back exposed... \nAT THE PATRIOT LINE... \nMarion, Dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen arrive at the same time, beating back the Redcoats... \nAs blue-uniformed Continentals reform the line, FIRING AT THE FALTERING REDCOATS... \nTARLETON sees Marion and fights his way toward him... \nMarion is oblivious, concentrating on holding the American line... \nTarleton mounts a terrified, riderless horses, draws his sword and gallops back toward the British lines, on a path that takes him directly past Marion... \nTarleton gets closer... raises his sword... slashes... \nMarion catches the flash of the blade out of the corner of his eye... \nDiverts the blow, knocking Tarleton from the mount... \nTarleton hits the ground... Marion draws his pistol, about to fire at Tarleton... \nTarleton KICKS OUT, knocking the pistol from Marion's hand... \nTarleton GRABS HIS SWORD, SLASHES AT MARION who dodges the blow... \nTarleton advances... Marion scrambles back, then rises... \nMarion grabs a BROKEN CAVALRY LANCE and FENDS OFF REPEATED BLOWS from Tarleton's SWORD... \nThen Marion sees his pistol, loaded with a bullet from Thomas' lead soldiers, lying on the ground... \nMarion makes his way toward the weapon... still BLOCKING BLOWS from Tarleton's sword... \nMarion focuses on the pistol... leaving himself exposed... \nTarleton sees the OPENING... MOVES ON MARION... TARLETON RAISES HIS SWORD, about to deliver the killing blow... \nMarion dives... GRABS HIS PISTOL... FIRES... KILLING TARLETON WITH A SHOT TO THE CHEST... \nMarion, stunned, exhausted and surprised to be alive, watches Tarleton fall... \nMarion stands over Tarleton's body and gives himself a moment of bitter triumph, then he turns back to the battle at hand... \nMarion picks up Tarleton's sword and runs to the AMERICAN LINE which stiffens as Dalton and Rev. Oliver are joined by Marion and a dozen other Patriots... \nThe blue-uniformed Continentals reform their line... \nMarion looks back toward Tarleton but finds that his body, along with the place and the moment of his death, has disappeared into the smoke of the battle... \nMarion and his men fight on... then, Redcoats start fleeing the field... \nFirst one Redcoat at a time... then more and more... \nEXT.  YORKTOWN - DAWN \nThe next day.  Silence.  The battlefield, as far as the eye can see, is covered with the debris of war, dead men and scattered weapons. \nThe British have retreated back behind their defenses but have left many of their men on the field. \nThe Patriots, regulars and militia, wait behind their barricades. \nThen, a single figure appears on one of the British parapets.  A DRUMMER BOY, no more than ten-years-old. Behind him, a single British officer. \nThey boy begins to beat the drum.  The officer raises a white flag. \nIn the American lines, the men see the flag.  Some call out, some cheer, some laugh, most, among them MARION, simply take a deep breath.  It's finally over. \nEXT.  YORKTOWN FIELD - DAY \nA massive ceremony, carefully orchestrated, laid out on the cleaned up battlefield. \nThousands of men, everyone in his place, as if well- directed actors in a grand theatrical performance. \nThe French and American armies, fifteen thousand men between them, stand in perfect formation on either side of the field, forming an avenue for the British army which marches out of it's fortification. \nAt the head of the avenue, WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF stand waiting. \nA musical band of Continentals, thirty men strong, loudly plays a tune, \"The World Turned Upside Down,\" a jaunty British air with a melancholy undercurrent. \nCORNWALLIS marches with his officers, eyes straight ahead, covering his agony as best he can. \nAs he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the South Carolina militia. \nMARION, standing with Dalton, Rev. Oliver, Abner, Scott and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass... \nCORNWALLIS glances over, noting what unit they are by a tattered battle standard that flies over them.  It's only a glance and he DOESN'T PICK OUT MARION, who is just one man among the many... \nAT THE HEAD OF THE AVENUE \nCornwallis reaches Washington.  They exchange unheard formal greetings. \n", "test1_input": "Marion runs off toward the woods, Nathan and Samuel follow.  Margaret hesitates, then herds William and Susan toward the river.  The house is enveloped in flames. \nEXT.  WOODED PATH - AFTERNOON \nMarion runs, breathing hard, keeping a punishing, steady pace.  Nathan and Samuel run behind, less winded than their father.  Marion makes up with cold fury what he lacks in youth. \nEXT.  WOODED HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON \nMarion runs up to the crest of a wooded hill.  Slows. Crawls the last few feet.  Nathan and Samuel just behind him.  Looks over the hillside. \nA path runs through a glen, about fifty feet below. Marion's eyes dart, absorbing the terrain, looking for advantage.  He points. \nMARION Nathan, there.  Samuel, there. \nThe boys go where they're told. \nMARION I'll fire first.  Then, Nathan, kill whoever is standing closest to Gabriel.  Samuel, kill the last man in the line. \nThey stagger under the weight of the orders.  Marion notices but continues. \nMARION After that, Samuel, load for Nathan. If something happens to me, put down your weapons and run as fast as you can, that way, downhill.  Hide in the brush by the river, then make your way home, get the others and go to Aunt Charlotte's farm. \nThe boys hesitate.  Marion looks at them firmly. \nMARION Boys... steady. \nNATHAN & SAMUEL Yes, father. \nMarion disappears into the underbrush. \nDOWN THE PATH \nThe dozen Redcoats approach.  Leading Gabriel on the rope. \nAHEAD OF THEM \nMarion waits in the thick undergrowth. \nOn the hillside, Nathan and Samuel grip their muskets and exchange a frightened, troubled look. \nThe REDCOATS enter the glen. \nMARION waits, then picks his moment and FIRES, killing the Redcoat Lieutenant with a shot to the chest. \nNATHAN AND SAMUEL INSTANTLY FIRE, dropping the last Redcoat in the line and the one holding Gabriel's rope. \nTHE REDCOATS STOP in confusion... \nGABRIEL kneels, out of the line of fire. \nThe REDCOAT SERGEANT takes command... \nREDCOAT SERGEANT FORM BY TWOS!  BACK-TO-BACK LINES... \nMARION KILLS the Sergeant with a shot to the throat... \nSamuel finishes reloading, swaps muskets with Nathan who FIRES, DROPPING ANOTHER REDCOAT. \nREDCOAT CORPORAL READY... \nMarion FIRES, killing the Corporal, the last man of rank... \nMarion ducks to the side as a VOLLEY OF REDCOAT MUSKET FIRE tears into the spot marked by Marion's rifle smoke... \nFROM THIS MOMENT ON, MARION NEVER STOPS MOVING.  He strides rather than runs, staying just inside the brush, offering only glimpses of himself.  He changes his pace and direction repeatedly, ducking and weaving, firing and loading while moving.  He never gives the Redcoats a stationary target, especially one marked by billowing smoke from his flintlock.  It's an Indian tactic and it works. \nThe Redcoats TRACK HIM WITH THEIR BARRELS, about to fire... Marion suddenly STOPS DEAD, REVERSES DIRECTION, several REDCOATS FIRE AND MISS. \nSix Redcoats left.  Some primed, some reloading.  A REDCOAT draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground and FIRES, killing him. \nSamuel, WEEPING as he loads, hands a primed musket to Nathan who FIRES... \nThe Redcoats turn their attention to THE SPOT MARKED BY NATHAN'S SMOKE... \nMarion SEES THE REDCOATS AIMING TOWARD THE BOYS.  He instantly STRIDES OUT INTO THE OPEN, drawing the Redcoats' attention from his sons... \nMarion FIRES BOTH HIS PISTOLS, killing two Redcoats... \nOne Redcoat finishes reloading... Marion rushes him, shoves aside the barrel and SLAMS him in the face with the butt of the musket... \nThis is a DIFFERENT MARION, a vicious, savage Marion, killing with stunning brutality... \nMarion drops his own expended rifle and CATCHES THE REDCOAT'S LOADED MUSKET before it hits the ground shoves that musket into another Redcoat's belly and FIRES... \nTwo Redcoats left, neither finished loading... \nMARION CHARGES, drawing his TOMAHAWK, ignores a GLANCING BAYONET WOUND to the neck, HACKS a Redcoat open... \nSplattering himself with BLOOD... \nThe final Redcoat, a cherubic-face young man, ducks into the woods... Marion tears after him... \nA FOOTRACE... the young Redcoat BLASTING THROUGH THE BRUSH... the older Marion, panting, losing ground... \nA CLEARING... the Redcoat is almost to the cover of the trees on the far side... \nMARION THROWS HIS TOMAHAWK which FLIES through the air and SINKS IN THE REDCOAT'S BACK... \nMarion runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks back his head and SLITS HIS THROAT... \nThen, without pausing, Marion wrenches the tomahawk from the Redcoat's body, and races back toward his sons... \nAT THE GLEN \nNathan and a weeping Samuel, stunned at the carnage, stumble down the hillside toward Gabriel.  Marion runs up and motions for them to stop. \nMarion, checks the Redcoats, making sure they're all dead. \n", "test1_true": "They quickly do so as Marion picks up a loaded musket and scans the road and the underbrush.  In a moment they're ready.  Marion finds his own Pennsylvania rifle, then he and his sons disappear into the underbrush. \nEXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY \nThe house and barns smolder.  Thomas' body lies in the yard.  Nearby, the bodies of the Patriot wounded, now dead. \nEXT.  RIVER SHED - POND BLUFF - DAY \nMargaret waits in the shed with William and Susan.  They hear a SOUND.  APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  Margaret pulls her sister and brother to her and waits. \nThe door opens.  It's Marion and Gabriel, Nathan and Samuel.  Margaret and the little ones throw themselves into Marion's arms. \nMargaret notices the blood on Marion.  She hesitates but her relief tightens her embrace. \nEXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY \nMarion, trailed by his children, walks past the soldiers' bodies and the remains of their house. \nHe kneels down next to Thomas' body.  On the ground Marion sees several of THOMAS' LEAD SOLDIERS.  He stares at them for a moment, picks them up and puts them in his pocket. \nMarion picks up Thomas and carries him up the hill toward the apple tree and Elizabeth's grave.  The children follow. \nEXT.  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY \nMarion digs a grave.  The children watch.  The only sounds are Marion's labored BREATHING, the RASP OF THE SHOVEL and the RUSTLE OF DEAD LEAVES blown along the ground by a soft wind. \nSome dry leaves catch on Thomas' still wet blood, as if trying to bandage his wound. \nEXT.  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY (LATER) \nMarion puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on the grave. Near tears and unsure of what to do next, he turns to Elizabeth's gravestone.  The soft wind blows.  Marion listens. \nHe turns and sees his children looking up at him.  Holding in his own tears, he gathers the children around him and let's them cry. \nMARION There, there... he's alright... he's with your mother now... \nHe stiffens, speaking formally: \nMARION Lord, we pray that You accept this child, Thomas Marion and give him a place at Your side with his mother. We ask that You embrace him and help us to understand the manner in which Your mercy works.  This we ask, in Your name.  Amen. \nMARION'S CHILDREN Amen. \nMarion looks at Elizabeth's grave, then he gently eases his children away. \nEXT.  BENNINGTON OVERLOOK - DAY \nMarion and his children stop at the overlook, seeing the Santee River valley spread out before them.  The SMOKE from two dozen farms rises. \nGABRIEL The Morgans, the Halseys, Williams, Stantons... \nThe smoke from the separate fires joins together high in the sky, forming what looks like stormclouds.  They walk on. \nEXT.  CHARLOTTE'S FARM - NIGHT \nMarion and his children wait in the cover of the woods. They see a pair of shadowed figures coming toward them from the house, Gabriel and Charlotte. \nGABRIEL Father, it's safe. \nMarion hustles the children out of the woods. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCharlotte sits, holding a sleeping Susan.  The other children lie awake on pallets.  Marion, still streaked with dried blood and sweat, tucks William and Margaret into bed. \nMARION Sleep, now. \nMarion moves on to Nathan. \nNATHAN Father... I killed those men... \nMARION Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do. \nNATHAN I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad... \nMarion isn't.  He turns to Samuel who's cried-out.  Marion reaches out to touch him but Samuel recoils from Marion's blood-streaked hand.  Marion sighs and tucks him in. \nMARION Try to get some sleep. \nMarion moves to take Susan from Charlotte who shakes her head. \nCHARLOTTE I'll stay with them. \nMarion nods and leaves Charlotte with the children. \nINT.  CHARLOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMarion enters.  He starts to pace but grows unsteady.  He rears back as if screaming but no sound comes from his mouth, as he looks upstairs, knowing his children are searching for the solace of sleep. \nHe opens a cabinet, pulls out a bottle of liquor, pours and drinks.  Then another. \nTHE SOUND OF HORSEMEN.  Gabriel walks in.  Tired.  Grim. \nGABRIEL How are they? \nMarion just shakes his head. \nGABRIEL Gates is at Hillsboro with the Continental Army.  I'll leave in the morning to join him. \nMarion nods.  Marion and Gabriel stand in silence for a long moment, neither one finding words.  Then Gabriel speaks softly. \nGABRIEL I'll tend my horse. \nHe leaves Marion alone. \nINT.  CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER) \nMarion stares at the fireplace.  Charlotte walks in carrying a pitcher and fresh clothing. \n", "test1_id": 1152, "test2_input": "ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE \nGabriel and several of Marion's men take supplies from Green, Anne, and some other townspeople.  Gabriel looks at Anne. \nGABRIEL If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea. \nANNE You call that a compliment? \nGABRIEL It's a start. \nShe gives him a bit of a smile.  He checks out her teeth. \nGABRIEL They look nice.  As white as can be. \nShe tries to glare but she can't help but laugh. \nMARION AND BILLINGS watch as Anne gives Gabriel some apples which he tosses into the air, one-by-one, catching them behind his back, a cocky move, executed with a disarming smile that makes Anne laugh again.  Marion smiles at his son's flirtation.  Billings smiles as well. \nBILLINGS He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly. \nMARION (softly) No, he takes after his mother... \nBillings is taken aback by the gentleness of Marion's words. \nMARION ... the younger ones barely remember her but Gabriel spent more time with Elizabeth... she taught him well, guided him, she was his North Star and mine... her father was a minister, in Boston, did you know that? \nBillings nods. \nMARION ... Gabriel's already a better man than I could ever hope to be... \nMarion hears himself and pulls his eyes from Gabriel, adopting a coarse, joking tone. \nMARION What do you mean, old and ugly? \nBILLINGS You got me beat on both accounts. \nMARION The hell I do. \nThey mount up, grateful to leave the sincerity behind. \nGabriel sees Marion and his men starting to ride off.  He says goodbye to Anne, then RUNS TO HIS HORSE, MOUNTING WITH A DRAMATIC LEAP.  He GALLOPS up, taking his place at his father's side.  Marion doesn't turn to look at him, but he knows he's there. \nEXT.  CAROLINA ROAD - DAY \nA patchwork of fields with a village visible in the distance.  The ROLLINS BOYS, 10 and 12, work a field, harvesting grain.  Hearing the SOUND OF HORSES' HOOVES, they stop and listen. \nThen they see a CLOUD OF DUST rising over the ridge line. Growing excited, they throw down their scythes and race down the hillside, madly stumbling and falling, trying to intersect the approaching sound. \nAt the bottom of the hill they pass their father, BEN ROLLINS, who watches his sons plant themselves on the side of the road, gazing in awe at: \nMARION AND HIS MEN, THUNDERING BY.  They're an impressive sight, a hundred-and-fifty heavily armed men, on powerful mounts, raising a cloud of dust as they gallop down the road. \nEXT.  CHARLESTON ROAD - DAY \nMarion and forty of his men, including Gabriel, sit on their motionless horses in the middle of the road.  There are a number of new faces among Marion's men, among them Ben Rollins.  Gabriel is lost in thought. \nMARION Gabriel?  Are you asleep? \nGABRIEL We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some. \nBILLINGS You got salt last week. \nGABRIEL Oh, right. (beat) Baking powder, we need baking powder. \nBILLINGS We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago. \nGabriel sighs.  They hear a SOUND APPROACHING, then see two British wagons round a curve with a guard of only SIX REDCOATS, commanded by a REDCOAT SERGEANT.  The Redcoat Sergeant signals stop. \nREDCOAT SERGEANT Halt.  Look alive, boys. \nThe young Redcoat privates nervously UNSHOULDER THEIR MUSKETS. \nMARION Sergeant, this road is closed. Those wagons now belong to the Continental Army. \nREDCOAT SERGEANT Ready arms!  By twos! \nMarion's surprised by the Sergeant's order. \nMARION Sergeant, there's no reason for you and your men to die.  Just leave the wagons and go. \nREDCOAT SERGEANT Steady, boys... \nMarion sighs and lets loose with a PIERCING WHISTLE.  The underbrush parts and more of Marion's men show themselves, MUSKETS LEVELED at the outnumbered Redcoats. \nREDCOAT SERGEANT This is the King's highway and I advise you and your men to make way. (to his men) Prepare to fire. \nMarion exchanges a look with Rev. Oliver who, like Marion, doesn't want to kill these men.  Seeing no other option, Marion turns to give the order, then stops, hearing a FAINT BARELY DETECTABLE, RUMBLING SOUND... \nA moment later Brother Joseph hears it as well... HORSES HOOVES, LOTS OF THEM, growing louder by the second, THUNDERING toward them from the road behind the British wagons... \nThen, the SOUND OF MORE HORSES, coming in fast on both flanks. \nMARION It's a trap... \nThe canvas sides of the British wagons are THROWN UP and DOZENS OF REDCOATS, armed with muskets, spill out... \nMarion's unmounted men run to their horses, LEAPING into their saddles... \nThen GREEN DRAGOONS appear, galloping down the wooded slopes on both flanks, astonishing horsemen, weaving through the trees without slacking their pace, SWORDS DRAWN, PISTOLS PRIMED... \nREDCOAT SERGEANT FIRE! \nA THUNDEROUS VOLLEY ERUPTS from the Redcoat infantry, KILLING several of Marion's men... \nMarion's men FIRE BACK from their BUCKING MOUNTS, most of their shots going awry... \nBehind the British wagons, a huge detachment of GREEN DRAGOONS appears, TARLETON among them... \n", "test2_true": "MARION AND HIS MEN spur their mounts, taking off down the road in the opposite direction... \nThe FLANKING BODIES OF DRAGOONS gallop out of the woods, JOINING THE MAIN BODY, riding in hard pursuit... \nEXT.  WOODED ROAD - DAY \nMarion and his men GALLOP down the road.  The much larger body of Green Dragoons THUNDER after them. \nEXT.  BLACK SWAMP ROAD - DAY \nMarion and his men ride along a raised road that drops off into Black Swamp on either side... \nThey ROUND A CURVE AND STOP, reining back their horses in confusion as they see: \nFIFTY GREEN DRAGOONS heading straight toward them... \nTHE DRAGOONS OPEN FIRE from both directions, KILLING several more of Marion's men, WOUNDING others... \nMarion's men FIRE BACK as best they can, caught in the CHAOS OF BUCKING AND FALLING HORSES and WOUNDED AND DISMOUNTED MEN... \nThey remount, doubling-up with the wounded... \nMARION sees an unaided wounded man.  LEAPS FROM HIS HORSE, heaves him onto his horse, slaps it... \nMarion's men head off both sides of the road into the swamp, struggling with their mounts as they hit the knee- deep water... \nMarion on foot with four men, only three horses... A DRAGOON, aiming his pistol, THUNDERS down on Marion... MARION FIRES, killing the Dragoon... \nMarion's men mount, one motions to Marion... \nMARION GO! \nMarion's men ride off, leaving him ALONE... a Dragoon is almost on him, SWORD RAISED.  Marion, his weapon spent, sees a thick branch on the ground, two feet long... grabs it... \nThe sword flashes and SINKS DEEPLY INTO THE WOOD... Marion YANKS, brings the rider off his horse, grabs the reins and SWINGS HIMSELF UP INTO THE EMPTY SADDLE.  Marion rides down the embankment... \nThe Dragoons rein back, slowed by the dead horses and men. They spur their reluctant mounts over the bodies and follow Marion and his men into the swamp... \nEXT.  BLACK SWAMP - DAY \nMARION RIDES HARD, galloping along a circuitous, barely visible dry trail... A MOMENT LATER, Tarleton and Green Dragoons follow... \nEXT.  DEEP IN THE SWAMPS - EVENING \nMARION CATCHES UP to a dozen of his men, including Gabriel and Billings.  Several of the men are badly wounded, barely clinging to their saddles... \nThey ride through the shallow water, get to a fork, SPLIT UP.  As they disappear into the swamp, the sounds of their horses are swallowed up in the LOUD BUZZING OF SWAMP INSECTS and the CRIES OF THE SWAMP BIRDS... \nA moment later, Tarleton and the vanguard of Dragoons ride up.  Tarleton signals stop at the fork... \nLooks... nothing.  Listens... nothing.  Chooses a path, the one Marion took.  Rides off, the Dragoons following... \nEXT.  DEEPER IN THE SWAMPS - NIGHT \nDarker still.  Tarleton and his men come to a dead end, blocked by a heavy tangle of huge swamp ferns and thorn bushes. \nThey rein back their horses, stopping in a confused mess. Tarleton calls to Gaskins and the Loyalist scouts. \nTARLETON Which way? \nGASKINS This way... no this... I think... \nTarleton makes his own choice... rides off... the Green Dragoons follow, the Loyalists bring up the rear. \nEXT.  SWAMP MORASS - NIGHT \nTarleton and his mounted Dragoons struggle through a nearly impassable morass of swamp-grass, reeds and swarming mosquitoes... \nThe exhausted Dragoons are wet, covered with mud, and bleeding from swamp briars.  The horses are spent and foaming... \nTarleton struggles harder than any, but finally even he has had enough.  He reins back his horse. \nTARLETON HALT! \nTarleton glares into the impenetrable darkness of plant- choked water and swamp... \nTARLETON Enough of this.  There are other ways to run down a fox. \nTarleton yanks on his reins, turns his horse and starts back the way they came.  His grateful men turn their horses and follow. \nIN THE UNDERGROWTH, Marion, Gabriel, Billings and three badly wounded men, with only four horses between them, calm their mounts... \nThey can hear, but not see the Dragoons.  Then, through the thick undergrowth, MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF TARLETON... \nGabriel, tending the wounded men, sees his father lock his eyes on Tarleton... \nMarion quickly opens his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets he made from Thomas' lead soldiers. Walking to his horse, Marion loads... \nMarion mounts, scanning the terrain, planning a route... \nGABRIEL Father, no... \nAs Marion spurs his horse to ride after Tarleton, Gabriel grabs the bridle.  He YANKS HARD, stopping Marion's horse dead.  THE HORSE BUCKS, nearly throwing Marion... \nMARION That's him.  Tarleton. \nMARION SPURS THE HORSE which tries to respond but is JERKED BACK AGAIN by Gabriel.  Marion angrily turns on his son... \nMARION Damn you!  Let go! \nGabriel looks up at his father, never loosening his iron grip on the bridles but speaking softly, almost pleadingly: \nGABRIEL Father, please... \nMarion looks down at Gabriel.  Then Marion looks over at Billings and the three wounded men... \nOne bleeds from an ugly neck wound... their shared mounts are nearly spent... \n", "test2_id": 1153, "test3_input": "SUSAN Why didn't he come? \nGABRIEL He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men. \nSUSAN He left us. \nGABRIEL I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can. \nSusan says nothing.  Gabriel continues, hopefully. \nGABRIEL There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you. \nSUSAN I don't care.  I hate him. \nGABRIEL You don't hate him. \nSUSAN Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back. \nGabriel kneels down and embraces her.  She stands coldly with her arms at her sides. \nEXT.  MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - DAY \nAn astonished Marion talks to Gabriel. \nMARION She spoke?  Susan spoke? \nGABRIEL Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along. \nMARION I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it... \nThe cloud passes quickly. \nMARION Tell me everything she said, word for word. \nGabriel hesitates. \nGABRIEL She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her. \nMARION She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that? \nGabriel nods. \nMARION Isn't that something. \nMarion shakes his head at the thought, smiling to himself. Gabriel, uncomfortable with the lie, changes the subject. \nGABRIEL Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about. \nMARION What? \nGABRIEL Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there. \nMarion nods and curiously follows Gabriel. \nEXT.  PEMBROKE VILLAGE - NIGHT \nDark.  The village square is deserted.  Marion follows Gabriel into the shadow of the village church.  They dismount, tie up their horses and enter the back door of the church. \nINT.  CHURCH - PEMBROKE VILLAGE - NIGHT \nMarion walks in and stops dead.  At the altar of the small sanctuary, HALF-A-DOZEN PEOPLE stand with Rev. Oliver.  At the center of the tiny gathering is Anne Green, flanked by her parents. \nGABRIEL Father, I'm looking for a best man. \nMarion is stunned but recovers quickly. \nMARION I'd be honored. \nThey share a moment, then head down the aisle.  Marion greets Anne's parents, shaking hands with her father and bowing to her mother.  Abner, at the door, nods that the coast is clear. \nREV. OLIVER Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony... \nMARION feels every word, looking straight ahead but knowing that he's standing next to his son. \nEXT.  CHURCH - NIGHT \nIn the shadows behind the church, the bride and groom say goodbye to the wedding party.  Anne talks quietly with her parents.  Marion and Gabriel talk nearby. \nGABRIEL Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days? \nMARION Granted.  Where are you going? \nGABRIEL Cheraw Falls. \nMARION It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born. \nGABRIEL I know. \nThey're silent for a moment. \nMARION She would have been pleased. \nGabriel nods, then turns to his horse, unnecessarily checking his pack ropes.  Anne joins them.  Marion embraces her and gives her a fatherly kiss. \nANNE I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning. \nMARION It's alright.  I'm very happy for you. \nHe helps her mount up.  Abner, on guard near the road, motions them on.  They all watch as Gabriel and Anne ride off. \nEXT.  WOODED ROAD - NIGHT \nMarion, Rev. Oliver and Abner ride slowly down the road. It's a beautiful, moonlit night.  Marion breaks the silence, speaking as much for himself as the others. \nMARION It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars. \nREV. OLIVER For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part. \n", "test3_true": "EXT.  SOUTH CAROLINA SHORE - DAY \nA British packet, a small, fast warship, lies anchored just offshore.  A rowboat, manned by half-a-dozen sailors, carrying a Redcoat Lieutenant, beaches.  Several Redcoats wait. \nThe Lieutenant, carrying a dispatch case, jumps out off the boat, mounts a waiting horse and rides off. \nEXT.  SMALL BRITISH FORT - DAY \nCornwallis, with his command staff clustered around him, sits on horseback reading the dispatch as the dispatch rider waits.  They're on a hillside, looking over the burned-out remains of a small British fort as some Redcoats pull the Union Jack out of a trench latrine. \nCornwallis motions Tarleton and they ride a few yards from the other officers and speak, out of earshot. \nCORNWALLIS From General Clinton in New York... (reading) \"... your request to move north is denied until you have properly dealt with your militia problem.\" (aside) He underlined, 'militia'. (reading) \"You have spent over six months dealing with a six-week problem.  It is essential that you quell the militia...\" (aside) Underlined again. (reading) \"... insurgency, particularly because of the likely move south of Washington and the inevitable arrival of the French.  Militia, as you have so often pointed out, is not worth the attention of a significant army, hence it is mystifying why militia has bedeviled you for so long...\" \nTarleton smiles slightly, enjoying the show. \nCORNWALLIS (reading) \"... it is my fervent hope that the vigor of your campaign comes to match the vigor of your correspondence with your Parliamentary and Court patrons. Only then might you share in the victory, on the verge of which I now stand.\" (beat) \"Your guardedly respectful Commander, General Sir George Clinton.\" \nCornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to Tarleton. \nCORNWALLIS If I fail, you fail. \nTARLETON Perhaps. \nCORNWALLIS And if I triumph, you triumph. \nTARLETON Probably. \nCORNWALLIS How can we end this madness? \nTARLETON Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war. \nCornwallis takes a moment, then speaks simply. \nCORNWALLIS Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty. \nTARLETON I understand, sir. \nTarleton salutes, yanks his reins, turning his horse, and rides off. \nEXT.  SMALL FARMHOUSE - SUNSET \nTarleton lounges in the grass on a slope in front of a farmhouse, looking out at a lovely sunset, absentmindedly picking at the petals of some wildflowers.  A HIDEOUS SCREAM pierces the calm. \nTarleton analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream, then rises, passing several Green Dragoons who wait with their horses in front of the farmhouse. \nTARLETON I believe they are almost ready. \nIN THE FARMHOUSE \nBlood is smeared on one wall, where half-a-dozen corpses lie in a jumbles mass on the floor. \nIn the parlor, Tarleton walks past more bodies, including a dead woman who lies protectively but ineffectually over the bloody bodies of her two young children, both under eight-years-old. \nIn the kitchen, Tarleton finds Wilkins, some Green Dragoons, and Gaskins, the Loyalist Militia commander and some of his low-life men. \nRob Fielding, one of the craftsmen in Marion's force, is tied, spread-eagle to the table, showing the terrible effects of PROTRACTED TORTURE.  Wilkins and Gaskins are nervous and apologetic as Tarleton walks into the room. \nGASKINS I'm sorry, sir.  He died. \nTarleton sighs, irritated. \nTARLETON Very well, get one of the others. \nGaskins and a couple of his men step into an attached woodshed where Billings sits, bound.  They roughly grab him and drag him into the kitchen. \nBILLINGS Damn your eyes.  Do your worst. \nTARLETON I intend to. \nThey tie Billings to the table. \nINT.  SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAY \nSilence.  A tiny rivulet of blood runs along a plank in the floor, disappearing into a gap between two floorboards. \nMarion, Dalton, Rev. Oliver, and several other men walk slowly through the farmhouse, in stunned silence. \nMarion sees the body of the mother, draped over her two young children.  Marion turns to Rev. Oliver who can only stare, offering no solace. \nThey pass Fielding's body, then enter the kitchen and see BILLINGS, DEAD, still tied to the table.  Marion reels. \nEXT.  SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAY \nMarion's men dig graves.  Marion watches.  Dalton steps up next to him. \nDALTON You still want me to give wounded Redcoats quarter? \nMarion doesn't answer.  Gabriel GALLOPS up.  He reins back his lathered horse and speaks to them without dismounting. \nGABRIEL Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well. \nMARION Where? \nGABRIEL Seven homes along the Black River so far... \nRollins doesn't pause.  He rushes to his horse, mounts up and rides off.  Marion and the other men mount up and ride off fast after him. \nEXT.  BLACK RIVER ROAD - DAY \nMarion his brigade catch up to Rollins and ride on with him. \nEXT.  ROLLINS' FARM - DAY \nThe small farm seen earlier, surrounded by hills, where the two boys, Rollins' sons ran down the hillside to catch a glimpse of the passing Marion and his brigade. \nThe house smolders.  No sign of life.  Gabriel, Abner and a few other men warily ride the perimeter of the cleared area around the house. \n", "test3_id": 1154}

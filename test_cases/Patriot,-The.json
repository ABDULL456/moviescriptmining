{"test1_input": "Marion runs off toward the woods, Nathan and Samuel follow.  Margaret hesitates, then herds William and Susan toward the river.  The house is enveloped in flames. \nEXT.  WOODED PATH - AFTERNOON \nMarion runs, breathing hard, keeping a punishing, steady pace.  Nathan and Samuel run behind, less winded than their father.  Marion makes up with cold fury what he lacks in youth. \nEXT.  WOODED HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON \nMarion runs up to the crest of a wooded hill.  Slows. Crawls the last few feet.  Nathan and Samuel just behind him.  Looks over the hillside. \nA path runs through a glen, about fifty feet below. Marion's eyes dart, absorbing the terrain, looking for advantage.  He points. \nMARION Nathan, there.  Samuel, there. \nThe boys go where they're told. \nMARION I'll fire first.  Then, Nathan, kill whoever is standing closest to Gabriel.  Samuel, kill the last man in the line. \nThey stagger under the weight of the orders.  Marion notices but continues. \nMARION After that, Samuel, load for Nathan. If something happens to me, put down your weapons and run as fast as you can, that way, downhill.  Hide in the brush by the river, then make your way home, get the others and go to Aunt Charlotte's farm. \nThe boys hesitate.  Marion looks at them firmly. \nMARION Boys... steady. \nNATHAN & SAMUEL Yes, father. \nMarion disappears into the underbrush. \nDOWN THE PATH \nThe dozen Redcoats approach.  Leading Gabriel on the rope. \nAHEAD OF THEM \nMarion waits in the thick undergrowth. \nOn the hillside, Nathan and Samuel grip their muskets and exchange a frightened, troubled look. \nThe REDCOATS enter the glen. \nMARION waits, then picks his moment and FIRES, killing the Redcoat Lieutenant with a shot to the chest. \nNATHAN AND SAMUEL INSTANTLY FIRE, dropping the last Redcoat in the line and the one holding Gabriel's rope. \nTHE REDCOATS STOP in confusion... \nGABRIEL kneels, out of the line of fire. \nThe REDCOAT SERGEANT takes command... \nREDCOAT SERGEANT FORM BY TWOS!  BACK-TO-BACK LINES... \nMARION KILLS the Sergeant with a shot to the throat... \nSamuel finishes reloading, swaps muskets with Nathan who FIRES, DROPPING ANOTHER REDCOAT. \nREDCOAT CORPORAL READY... \nMarion FIRES, killing the Corporal, the last man of rank... \nMarion ducks to the side as a VOLLEY OF REDCOAT MUSKET FIRE tears into the spot marked by Marion's rifle smoke... \nFROM THIS MOMENT ON, MARION NEVER STOPS MOVING.  He strides rather than runs, staying just inside the brush, offering only glimpses of himself.  He changes his pace and direction repeatedly, ducking and weaving, firing and loading while moving.  He never gives the Redcoats a stationary target, especially one marked by billowing smoke from his flintlock.  It's an Indian tactic and it works. \nThe Redcoats TRACK HIM WITH THEIR BARRELS, about to fire... Marion suddenly STOPS DEAD, REVERSES DIRECTION, several REDCOATS FIRE AND MISS. \nSix Redcoats left.  Some primed, some reloading.  A REDCOAT draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground and FIRES, killing him. \nSamuel, WEEPING as he loads, hands a primed musket to Nathan who FIRES... \nThe Redcoats turn their attention to THE SPOT MARKED BY NATHAN'S SMOKE... \nMarion SEES THE REDCOATS AIMING TOWARD THE BOYS.  He instantly STRIDES OUT INTO THE OPEN, drawing the Redcoats' attention from his sons... \nMarion FIRES BOTH HIS PISTOLS, killing two Redcoats... \nOne Redcoat finishes reloading... Marion rushes him, shoves aside the barrel and SLAMS him in the face with the butt of the musket... \nThis is a DIFFERENT MARION, a vicious, savage Marion, killing with stunning brutality... \nMarion drops his own expended rifle and CATCHES THE REDCOAT'S LOADED MUSKET before it hits the ground shoves that musket into another Redcoat's belly and FIRES... \nTwo Redcoats left, neither finished loading... \nMARION CHARGES, drawing his TOMAHAWK, ignores a GLANCING BAYONET WOUND to the neck, HACKS a Redcoat open... \nSplattering himself with BLOOD... \nThe final Redcoat, a cherubic-face young man, ducks into the woods... Marion tears after him... \nA FOOTRACE... the young Redcoat BLASTING THROUGH THE BRUSH... the older Marion, panting, losing ground... \nA CLEARING... the Redcoat is almost to the cover of the trees on the far side... \nMARION THROWS HIS TOMAHAWK which FLIES through the air and SINKS IN THE REDCOAT'S BACK... \nMarion runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks back his head and SLITS HIS THROAT... \nThen, without pausing, Marion wrenches the tomahawk from the Redcoat's body, and races back toward his sons... \nAT THE GLEN \nNathan and a weeping Samuel, stunned at the carnage, stumble down the hillside toward Gabriel.  Marion runs up and motions for them to stop. \nMarion, checks the Redcoats, making sure they're all dead. \n", "test1_true": "They quickly do so as Marion picks up a loaded musket and scans the road and the underbrush.  In a moment they're ready.  Marion finds his own Pennsylvania rifle, then he and his sons disappear into the underbrush. \nEXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY \nThe house and barns smolder.  Thomas' body lies in the yard.  Nearby, the bodies of the Patriot wounded, now dead. \nEXT.  RIVER SHED - POND BLUFF - DAY \nMargaret waits in the shed with William and Susan.  They hear a SOUND.  APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  Margaret pulls her sister and brother to her and waits. \nThe door opens.  It's Marion and Gabriel, Nathan and Samuel.  Margaret and the little ones throw themselves into Marion's arms. \nMargaret notices the blood on Marion.  She hesitates but her relief tightens her embrace. \nEXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY \nMarion, trailed by his children, walks past the soldiers' bodies and the remains of their house. \nHe kneels down next to Thomas' body.  On the ground Marion sees several of THOMAS' LEAD SOLDIERS.  He stares at them for a moment, picks them up and puts them in his pocket. \nMarion picks up Thomas and carries him up the hill toward the apple tree and Elizabeth's grave.  The children follow. \nEXT.  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY \nMarion digs a grave.  The children watch.  The only sounds are Marion's labored BREATHING, the RASP OF THE SHOVEL and the RUSTLE OF DEAD LEAVES blown along the ground by a soft wind. \nSome dry leaves catch on Thomas' still wet blood, as if trying to bandage his wound. \nEXT.  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY (LATER) \nMarion puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on the grave. Near tears and unsure of what to do next, he turns to Elizabeth's gravestone.  The soft wind blows.  Marion listens. \nHe turns and sees his children looking up at him.  Holding in his own tears, he gathers the children around him and let's them cry. \nMARION There, there... he's alright... he's with your mother now... \nHe stiffens, speaking formally: \nMARION Lord, we pray that You accept this child, Thomas Marion and give him a place at Your side with his mother. We ask that You embrace him and help us to understand the manner in which Your mercy works.  This we ask, in Your name.  Amen. \nMARION'S CHILDREN Amen. \nMarion looks at Elizabeth's grave, then he gently eases his children away. \nEXT.  BENNINGTON OVERLOOK - DAY \nMarion and his children stop at the overlook, seeing the Santee River valley spread out before them.  The SMOKE from two dozen farms rises. \nGABRIEL The Morgans, the Halseys, Williams, Stantons... \nThe smoke from the separate fires joins together high in the sky, forming what looks like stormclouds.  They walk on. \nEXT.  CHARLOTTE'S FARM - NIGHT \nMarion and his children wait in the cover of the woods. They see a pair of shadowed figures coming toward them from the house, Gabriel and Charlotte. \nGABRIEL Father, it's safe. \nMarion hustles the children out of the woods. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCharlotte sits, holding a sleeping Susan.  The other children lie awake on pallets.  Marion, still streaked with dried blood and sweat, tucks William and Margaret into bed. \nMARION Sleep, now. \nMarion moves on to Nathan. \nNATHAN Father... I killed those men... \nMARION Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do. \nNATHAN I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad... \nMarion isn't.  He turns to Samuel who's cried-out.  Marion reaches out to touch him but Samuel recoils from Marion's blood-streaked hand.  Marion sighs and tucks him in. \nMARION Try to get some sleep. \nMarion moves to take Susan from Charlotte who shakes her head. \nCHARLOTTE I'll stay with them. \nMarion nods and leaves Charlotte with the children. \nINT.  CHARLOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMarion enters.  He starts to pace but grows unsteady.  He rears back as if screaming but no sound comes from his mouth, as he looks upstairs, knowing his children are searching for the solace of sleep. \nHe opens a cabinet, pulls out a bottle of liquor, pours and drinks.  Then another. \nTHE SOUND OF HORSEMEN.  Gabriel walks in.  Tired.  Grim. \nGABRIEL How are they? \nMarion just shakes his head. \nGABRIEL Gates is at Hillsboro with the Continental Army.  I'll leave in the morning to join him. \nMarion nods.  Marion and Gabriel stand in silence for a long moment, neither one finding words.  Then Gabriel speaks softly. \nGABRIEL I'll tend my horse. \nHe leaves Marion alone. \nINT.  CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER) \nMarion stares at the fireplace.  Charlotte walks in carrying a pitcher and fresh clothing. \n", "test1_id": 1152, "test2_input": "Marion shakes his head to himself. \nMARION That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect. \nGABRIEL I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing. \nMarion's quiet for a moment.  Then he speaks: \nMARION It was in '63.  It was a bad time. The French and the Cherokee had raided along the Blue Ridge.  All the English settlers took refuge at Fort Wilderness but the French captured it.  We were sent in relief.  Harry Lee, Billings, sixty of us.  We already had something of a reputation for being... harsh. When we got there the fort was abandoned.  Not a French soldier or Cherokee anywhere.  They had left a week earlier.  What we found was... bad. \nMarion grows quieter with the memory of how bad. \nMARION They had left the settlers there. The men had been burned alive, the women were in pieces and the children were on stakes. \nMarion's silent for a moment. \nMARION We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford. \nGABRIEL Go on. \nMARION We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon. (beat) The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee. (beat) The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight. (beat) That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks. \nGabriel is silent.  Marion looks at him closely. \nMARION It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that. \nGABRIEL I see, do as I say, not as I do. \nMARION Yes. \nThey hear HORSES HOOVES.  Abner rides in from the opposite side of the village from the church, not having seen the results of the massacre.  Excited, he dismounts. \nABNER THEY'RE HERE!  CONTINENTALS, THEY'RE HERE! \nMarion and Gabriel just look at him.  Abner is confused by their reaction.  Then he sees the remains of the church and the laid out, charred bodies. \nEXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nMixed gatherings of Marion's militia and Continentals are clustered around the campfires, with more Continentals arriving all the time. \nSome of the militiamen and regulars regale each other with tales of their exploits but most are grim and tired, talking quietly. \nA couple of Patriots play a MELANCHOLY TUNE ON FIFE AND VIOLIN. \nMarion's tent is set up but he's nowhere to be seen. Gabriel walks to Marion's gear.  Finding Marion's weapon's belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the paint-flecked MUSKET BALLS MADE FROM THOMAS' LEAD SOLDIERS.  As Gabriel takes one, Marion steps up behind him. \nMARION If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course. \nGABRIEL As you did at Fort Wilderness? \nBefore Marion can answer they see HARRY LEE RIDE UP TO THEM.  He dismounts, excited, voluble.  He strides over, pleased to see Marion, oblivious to his and Gabriel's mood. \nLEE Look at you!  I knew you could do it! \nLee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull. \nLEE We have a chance!  Better than a chance!  Cornwallis is running to the Chesapeake, probably to meet his fleet at Yorktown.  I wish I could see his face when he sees a dozen French ships floating there.  And Washington should be a day or two behind him. (beat) And on top of everything, I have a son!  Born last month in Alexandria. \nGabriel rises and walks away.  Lee finally tunes into the pall hanging over Marion and the just departed Gabriel. He turns to Marion. \nMARION His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child. \nLEE I'm sorry, I didn't know. \nMarion nods.  They stand in silence.  Lee hands Marion the bottle.  He takes a drink. \nEXT.  ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nDark.  Quiet.  Sentries are on duty.  Marion's tent glows from a single candle.  He blows the candle out, then steps out of the tent into the night. \nHe begins his nightly walk of the perimeter. \nAlmost immediately, Marion notices something amiss. Dalton has discovered it at the same time and hurries over to Marion. \nAT ONE OF THE CAMPSITES \nMarion and Dalton and several of the other men look down at some empty bedrolls. \nDALTON Gabriel and at least a dozen others. They must have left right after the watch change. \nMARION That means they have two hours on us. \nMarion strides to his horse.  The other men follow him. \nEXT.  WOODED ROAD - NIGHT \nMarion, Dalton and Rev. Oliver and two dozen other men ride. \nEXT.  WOODED ROAD - NIGHT \nDark.  Very quiet.  A moonless night.  Marion and his men, on foot, make their way along the side of the river. Brother Joseph hurries out of the darkness and speaks to Marion. \nBROTHER JOSEPH Fifty Green Dragoons, camped about a quarter mile from here.  Sentries at four points. \nSuddenly they hear the SOUNDS OF MUSKETS FIRE ahead of them in the darkness.  Marion takes off at a full run with his men right behind. \nEXT.  OUTSKIRTS OF GREEN DRAGOON ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nMarion and his men BLAST THROUGH THE BRUSH.  Running toward the SOUNDS OF THE BATTLE, which grows louder with every step... \nMarion cocks his pistol and extracts his tomahawk on the run... \nThe LIGHTS OF THE BATTLE:  The STROBES OF THE MUSKET SHOTS illuminate the woods ahead of them... \nMoving fast, they PASS TWO DEAD BRITISH SENTRIES, without slowing down... \nTHEY BLAST OUT OF THE WOODS into... \n", "test2_true": "Half-dressed GREEN DRAGOONS in formation FIRE IN VOLLEYS... \nRunning men.  Scattered MUSKET FIRE. \nThe strobes of the muskets illuminate RUNNING MEN and other men in HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT. \nWILKINS IS IN COMMAND.  Tarleton is nowhere to be seen. \nGabriel and Abner, both slightly wounded, fight a desperate holding action... \nOn the other side of the clearing, a square of Dragoons forms near Wilkins. \nWILKINS FIRE! \nThe DRAGOONS FIRE A MASSED VOLLEY, hitting Gabriel, Abner and several other Patriots. \nGABRIEL, BADLY WOUNDED, falls to his knees... \nThe Dragoons pull their pistols about to fire again. \nMarion and his men OPEN FIRE... \nStaggering them... \nMarion sees Wilkins about to fire at Gabriel... \nMarion runs... \nSees another Redcoat about to fire at Gabriel... \nMARION KILLS HIM with a pistol shot. \nWilkins cocks his flintlock pistol, aims at Gabriel... \nMARION'S ABOUT TO THROW HIS TOMAHAWK... TOO LATE... \nWILKINS FIRES... HITTING GABRIEL WHO FLIES BACKWARD... \nMarion THROWS THE TOMAHAWK, sinking it into Wilkins' chest... \nThe rest of Marion's men thunder into the Dragoons... \nOverpowering them... \nMarion races to Gabriel... \nThrows himself onto the ground next to him... \nCradling him... \nGabriel is stunned, confused by the wounds. \nGABRIEL I'm alright, I... \nHe tries to stand... \nMARION Let me help you... \nGabriel weakens in Marion's arms... falters... Marion watches the life drain from Gabriel... He tries to hold the blood in, to no avail... \nDalton plants himself next to Marion, defending him and Gabriel... \nMarion caresses Gabriel and watches as... \nGABRIEL DIES. \nThe life drains from Marion.  No anger.  Only pain.  He looks at Gabriel, lost in a dream, an incomprehensible nightmare of loss and overwhelming emptiness. \nEXT.  CLEARING - DAWN \nMarion's men finish laying out the bodies of their dead. The Dragoons are still where they fell.  The Patriots are laid out in a row, their faces covered by their coats. \nMarion sits on the battlefield, next to Gabriel's body. Dalton gingerly approaches him. \nDALTON Colonel... \nMarion slowly stands and picks up Gabriel's body, cradling him like a child.  They head off into the brush. \nEXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nMore Continentals have arrived, now outnumbering Marion's men three-to-one.  The encampment is active.  A few of the men drink and TALK LOUDLY.  The two men playing the fife and violin PLAY A MORE VIBRANT TUNE. \nINT.  MARION'S TENT - NIGHT \nDark.  Shadowed.  The sounds of celebration can be heard outside the tent. \nMarion sits on his camp chair.  Gabriel lies on the ground carefully covered up to his chin with a blanket.  A single candle burns. \nRev. Oliver enters the tent. \nREV. OLIVER May I help you try to find solace with the word of God? \nNo response. \nREV. OLIVER Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and... \nMARION He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he? \nREV. OLIVER Yes, he does. \nRev. Oliver pulls up a camp stool.  He and Marion sit in silence. \nEXT.  MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - MORNING \nThe Patriots, Continentals and Militia, are moving out. Most of the tents have been taken down.  Wagons are rolling out.  Companies of Continentals march off in good order. \nMARION'S TENT still stands.  His men finish packing up, storing their heavy gear in wagons, tying their field gear onto their horses. \n", "test2_id": 1153, "test3_input": "DALTON OUR LINE IS FALTERING... \nMarion takes a quick glance at the Continental line, seeing... \nScott, Rev. Oliver, Abner and a dozen more of his men, in the middle of a confused battle, with a larger mass of Redcoats who are advancing through the broken Continental line... \nMARION IS TORN... \nHe looks to Tarleton, seeing him distracted, vulnerable but too distant a target for the pistol... \nThen Marion looks to Rev. Oliver and the others... Dalton can't wait... he runs off... \nMarion wavers... \nThen he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to help the faltering Patriots... \nTARLETON sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees Marion himself, his back exposed... \nAT THE PATRIOT LINE... \nMarion, Dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen arrive at the same time, beating back the Redcoats... \nAs blue-uniformed Continentals reform the line, FIRING AT THE FALTERING REDCOATS... \nTARLETON sees Marion and fights his way toward him... \nMarion is oblivious, concentrating on holding the American line... \nTarleton mounts a terrified, riderless horses, draws his sword and gallops back toward the British lines, on a path that takes him directly past Marion... \nTarleton gets closer... raises his sword... slashes... \nMarion catches the flash of the blade out of the corner of his eye... \nDiverts the blow, knocking Tarleton from the mount... \nTarleton hits the ground...

YORKTOWN - DAWN \nThe next day.  Silence.  The battlefield, as far as the eye can see, is covered with the debris of war, dead men and scattered weapons. \nThe British have retreated back behind their defenses but have left many of their men on the field. \nThe Patriots, regulars and militia, wait behind their barricades. \nThen, a single figure appears on one of the British parapets.  A DRUMMER BOY, no more than ten-years-old. Behind him, a single British officer. \nThey boy begins to beat the drum.  The officer raises a white flag. \nIn the American lines, the men see the flag.  Some call out, some cheer, some laugh, most, among them MARION, simply take a deep breath.  It's finally over. \nEXT.  YORKTOWN FIELD - DAY \nA massive ceremony, carefully orchestrated, laid out on the cleaned up battlefield. \nThousands of men, everyone in his place, as if well- directed actors in a grand theatrical performance. \nThe French and American armies, fifteen thousand men between them, stand in perfect formation on either side of the field, forming an avenue for the British army which marches out of it's fortification. \nAt the head of the avenue, WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF stand waiting. \nA musical band of Continentals, thirty men strong, loudly plays a tune, \"The World Turned Upside Down,\" a jaunty British air with a melancholy undercurrent. \nCORNWALLIS marches with his officers, eyes straight ahead, covering his agony as best he can. \nAs he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the South Carolina militia. \nMARION, standing with Dalton, Rev. Oliver, Abner, Scott and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass... \nCORNWALLIS glances over, noting what unit they are by a tattered battle standard that flies over them.  It's only a glance and he DOESN'T PICK OUT MARION, who is just one man among the many... \nAT THE HEAD OF THE AVENUE \nCornwallis reaches Washington.  They exchange unheard formal greetings. \n", "test3_true": "FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN, American and French, RAISE THEIR VOICES in a CHEER OF ASTONISHING VOLUME... \nWith every other pair of eyes directed toward the ceremony between Washington and Cornwallis, MARION quietly and unnoticed, slips out the back of the formation and walks away. \nEXT.  YORKTOWN - DAY \nThe surrender ceremony continues.  Marion, on the fringe of the field, finishes saddling his horses and prepares to leave.  LEE walks out of the crowd and joins him.  They lock eyes for a moment, then Marion mounts up. \nLEE Goodbye, Francis. \nMARION Goodbye, Harry. \nMarion reaches down.  They shake hands. \nMARION And congratulations on the birth of your son. \nLEE Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace. \nMARION I hope so. \nAs Marion starts to ride off, he reins back and stops, speaking back to Lee over his shoulder. \nMARION Your son, what did you name him? \nLEE Robert.  Robert E. Lee. \nMarion smiles. \nMARION A good name for a farmer. \nLee nods.  Marion rides off. \nEXT.  CHERAW FALLS - DAY \nMarion's children and Charlotte sit by the river.  Samuel sits on the lookout ledge with his musket.  Suddenly he stands, looking out, seeing something. \nCharlotte and the others notice.  They're worried.  Then they see Samuel throw down his musket and tear down the path, running as fast as he can, tumbling, then regaining his feet... \nCharlotte and the others know who's coming... \nThe children take off running after Samuel... \nRacing toward the road... \nCharlotte hurries after them... \nAND THEN THEY SEE HIM... \nMARION, riding at a full gallop... \nThe children cry out with tears of joy... \nMARION see Susan... \nHe gallops toward her... \nLEANS OVER... \nWithout slowing, he SWOOPS HER UP into the saddle... \nShe wraps herself around him... \nHe reins back, stops and dismounts, just as the other children reach him... \nThey throw themselves into his arms... embracing him... \nCharlotte hurries up behind them... \nShe and Marion lock eyes and he is enveloped by the hugs of his children. \nEXT.  POND BLUFF - EVENING \nSummer.  The apple tree at the top of the hill is covered with apples. \nMarion's house is partially rebuilt and habitable.  The workshop is already completed. \nMARION'S CHILDREN, Nathan, Samuel, Margaret and William, play in the tall grass in front of the house with the two GREAT DANES. \nCHARLOTTE sits on the front porch, NURSING AN INFANT. \nMARION walks out of his workshop, trailed by Susan.  He carries a just-completed rocking chair. \nThe chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. \nHe steps onto the porch next to Charlotte and places the rocking chair next to her. \nMARION Two pounds, fourteen ounces. \nCHARLOTTE Lovely. \nHe smiles and make a minute adjustment in the chair's position.

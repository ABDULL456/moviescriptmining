1   INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY                                      1 
WE MEET: MUMBLES(late 30s) and ONE TWO (late 30s). They are listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS. 
We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a changing city, LONDON. 
SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.) Two years ago this property cost one million pounds. (we SEE building) Today, it costs five million. 
The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene. OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.) How did this happen? (CUT TO relevant pictures as he speaks) Attractive tax opportunities for foreign investment, restrictive building consent and massive hedge fund bonuses,... (beat) London, my good man, is fast becoming the financial and cultural capital of the world. 
SLICK ESTATE AGENT And of course the Russians have come to town. 
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT Makes it hard to compete with an ex- Soviet oligarch that has six billion dollars in his back pocket. They don't haggle the price, they double the price. 
SLICK ESTATE AGENT Russians come, prices rise, and it doesn't stop. It only goes one way. 
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT Up. 
SLICK ESTATE AGENT I can't teach you how to skin a cat, but I can tell you a lot about the money in bricks and mortar. (MORE)

We cut back into the office where the LAWYER lays out the building plans. 
LAWYER TYPE These are the plans,...it costs ten and it'll be worth twenty with planning. But first you gotta give the councilor a drink.

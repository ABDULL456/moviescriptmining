217   EXT. BURNED OUT THEATER - DAY                               217 
Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater. 
The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50. 
BLOOM I'm so scared. Anything I can imagine finding in there, I'm scared of. 
PENELOPE I'm going to be here when you come out. 
She kisses him. 
He puts his hand on the door.    Hesitates.   Then goes. 
Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door. Goes in alone. 
218   INT. THEATER LOBBY                                            218 
No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place.      Bloom steps lightly, deeper into the theater. 
BLOOM Stephen! 
219   INT. THEATER AUDITORIUM                                       219 
A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage. 
Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady. 
BLOOM Stephen! 
A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's face. He spins, trapped in its glare. 
A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian. 
When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few feet ahead of him towards the stage. 
Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop. 
With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it. 
220   INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE                                        220 
Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged forms of light and black. 
BLOOM (unsteady) Stephen. Game's up. Come on out. Let's blow this one hat town. 
Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly lighting Stephen's face. 
Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood. 
Bloom cries and rushes towards him... 
220   CONTINUED:                                                 220 
STEPHEN No!   No Bloom, freeze. 
He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand. 
BLOOM Stephen, who is it?   Is it the Dog? 
STEPHEN Did Penelope wire the money? 
BLOOM Yeah. 
STEPHEN They're calling to check right now. Don't move. I'm alright. 
The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear for a moment then flips it closed. 
Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily stands, cut loose. 
STEPHEN (cont'd) Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm coming to you. 
He takes a couple wobbly steps. 
Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer... 
And the utility lamp switches off. 
BLOOM No! 
Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into the blackness. 
Stephen drops flat to the ground. 
The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness, strobing the scene like stage lightning. 
Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen lies on his stomach out in the open. 
BLOOM (cont'd) Stephen! 
220   CONTINUED: (2)                                              220 
STEPHEN Stay back! 
But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open, unloading three more rounds into the dark.

I even wrote Jenny and told her all about it. I sent her letters. Not every day, but almost. I told her what I was doin' and asked her what she was doing, and I told her how I thought about her always. \nEXT. JENNY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY \nJenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar. \nShe hugs a hippie guy, then jumps into the back of a Volkswagen bus with another guy. \nFORREST (V.O.) And how I was looking forward to getting a letter from her just as soon as she had the time I'd always let her know that I was okay. \nForrest reaches down and picks up Tex from the ground. Forrest pulls Tex up over his shoulder, then runs. \nFORREST (V.O.) I couldn't just let him lay there all alone, scared the way he was, so I grabbed him up and run him out of there. \nForrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing. \nHe sets Tex down on the bank of a river, and runs back into the jungle. \nFORREST (V.O.) And every time I went back looking for Bubba, somebody else was saying, \"Help me, Forrest. Help me.\" \nForrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of the river next to Tex, and then runs back toward the jungle. \nForrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground and turns him over. It is DALLAS. \nDALLAS Can't hear... Can't hear... \nDallas is dropped off at the bank next to the other wounded soldiers. Forrest turns to go back to the jungle. \n2ND WOUNDED SOLDIER No sweat, man. Just lay back. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. \nFORREST (V.O.) I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba. \nSTRONGARM (over radio) You're danger close for crack air, over. \nForrest trips over something and falls to the ground. He looks up to find two bloody legs. It is Lt. Dan, who is wounded. He speaks into the radio. \nLT. DAN (into radio) Roger, Strongarm, I know my position is danger close! We got Charlie all over this area! I gotta have those fast movers in here now! Over! \nSTRONGARM (over radio) Six, Strongarm, we want... \nFORREST Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead! \nLT.

Dan over his shoulder and runs through the jungle. \nSTRONGARM Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6. This is Strongarm, be advised, your fast movers are inbound at this time, over. \nFORREST (V.O.) Then it felt like something just jumped up and bit me. \nForrest falls down. \nFORREST Ah, something bit me! \nForrest gets up as Lt. Dan yells. Lt. Dan fires his pistol at the unseen enemy as Forrest pulls him away. \nLT. DAN You dink son-of-a-bitch! I can't leave the platoon! I told you to leave me there, Gump. Forget about me. Get yourself out! Did you hear what I said! Goddammit, pull me down! Get your ass out of here! \nForrest drops Lt. Dan down at the bank, next to the other wounded soldiers. Lt. Dan grabs Forrest by the shirt, angry. \nLT. DAN I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, goddamn you! What the hell do you think you're going? \nFORREST To get Bubba. \nLT. DAN I got an air strike inbound right now. They're gonna nape the whole area. \nForrest gets up and runs as Lt. Dan yells after him. \nLT. DAN Gump, you stay here, goddammit! That's an order! \nFORREST I gotta find Bubba! \nForrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba. Forrest slows down and looks around carefully. \nBUBBA Forrest... \nFORREST Bubba... \nBubba looks up as he lies on the ground. \nBUBBA I'm okay. \nBubba holds a palm frond over his wound. Forrest removes the frond to look at the wound. Bubba's chest has been blown open. \nFORREST Oh, Bubba, no... \nBUBBA Naw, I'm gonna be all right. \nForrest looks around as he hear the voices of the enemy. \nFORREST Come on. Come on. Come here... \nForrest carries Bubba through the jungle. The sound of approaching planes fills the air. \nBUBBA I'm okay, Forrest. I'm all right. \nThe roar of approaching planes is deafening. Forrest looks up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs. \nForrest runs, carrying Bubba. The fireballs explode behind him. The entire jungle area is in flames as Forrest runs. \nFORREST (V.O.) So I started playing it all the time. \nForrest hits ping-pong balls. \nFORREST (V.O.) I played ping-pong even when I didn't have anyone to play ping-pong with. \nThe balls at land in a bed pan positioned on a chair. A group of wounded soldier sit and watch Forrest play with himself. Forrest hits two balls at a time against the opposite side of the table. \nFORREST (V.O.) The hospital's people said it made me look like a duck in water, whatever that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play. \nLt. Dan stares out the window. Forrest lies in his bed asleep. A hand reaches and grabs him. \nFORREST (V.O.) I played ping-pong so much, I even played it in my sleep. \nLt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor, and holds Forrest down. \nLT. DAN Now, you listen to me. We all have a destiny. Nothing just happens, it's all part of a plan. I should have died out there with my men! But now, I'm nothing but a goddamned cripple! A legless freak. Look! Look! Look at me! Do you see that? Do you know what it's like not to be able to use your legs? \nFORREST Well... Yes, sir, I do. \nLT. DAN Did you hear what I said? You cheated me. I had a destiny. I was supposed to die in the field! With honor! That was my destiny! And you cheated me out of it! You understand what I'm saying, Gump? This wasn't supposed to happen. Not to me. I had a destiny. I was Lieutenant Dan Tyler. \nFORREST Yo-You're still Lieutenant Dan. \nLt. Dan looks at Forrest, lets go of Forrest and rolls. \nLt. Dan sits up as Forrest looks at him. \nLT. DAN Look at me. What am I gonna do now? What am I gonna do now? \nINT. REC ROOM/VIETNAM HOSPITAL - ANOTHER DAY \nForrest plays ping-pong by himself. An OFFICER walks up to him. \nOFFICER P.F.C.

The crowd grows restless. \nCROWD We can't hear you! We can't hear anything! \nHILARY This one! This one! Give me that! \nHilary plugs in the right patch cord. \nHILARY That's it. \nFORREST ...and that's all I have to say about that. \nForrest looks at the massive crowd. They are silent.

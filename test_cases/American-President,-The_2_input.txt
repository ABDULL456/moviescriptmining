SHEPHERD It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community. These people are outta control. 
A.J. I think they're just frustrated, Mr. President. 
ROBIN Are they blaming the President for global warming? 
A.J. Well, they don't think he caused it, if that's what you mean. 
(continuing; to SHEPHERD) Sir, I'm on the phone with these people twice a week. I honestly don't know what they want at this point. 
LEWIS What they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions. 
A.J. It won't pass at 20 percent. 
LEWIS We haven't really tried. 
A.J. Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane hold too many markers. If we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year. 
SHEPHERD Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them the President resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to the floor. But we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction. If they want to pull their support, fine. At 63 percent job approval rating. I don't need their help getting a bill passed. We gotta get going-- where's Leon? 
A.J. (to an AIDE) Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him the President's-- 
A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on pedestrian collision in the outer office-- 
MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.) Aaagh! 
KODAK (O.S.) Sorry! Sorry, my fault. 
A.J. (to the AIDE) Never mind. 
LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close over the past few years. 
KODAK Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD You all right? 
KODAK They keep moving that big ficus plant. 
A.J. We're all here, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD Okay. First, I wanted to say congratulations. Three years ago, we were elected to the White House by one of the narrowest margins in history, and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of registered voters think we're doing a good job. 
KODAK Wait a second. You wanted me to poll registered voters? 
Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles... 
SHEPHERD But the poll also tells us what we already knew: We don't get this crime bill of ours through Congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory. So, starting today, we're shifting it into gear. 
ROBIN Can I tell my morning press gaggle that gun control-- 
A.J. Crime control, Robin. Gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime. 
LEWIS Hang on, are we not-- 
A.J. Lewis-- 
LEWIS Are we not putting back the handgun restrictions?! 
A.J. We're leaving 'em out. 
LEWIS Sir, we campaigned on this issue. Now, I understand we took it out when we were in the low forties, but we can push it through now. 
SHEPHERD After the elections. 
LEWIS Sir, we may never have an opportunity like this again. Let's take this 63 percent out for a spin and see what it can do. 
SHEPHERD We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis. We need it to get re-elected. For reasons passing understanding, people do not relate guns to gun-related crime. 
A.J. Robin, you can brief the press this afternoon. As of today, the crime bill's priority one on the President's domestic agenda. 
ROBIN Got it. 
A.J. Leon, you're gonna run the war room. We're gonna need detailed projections for all the target districts by the end of the week. And, Leon, don't be a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do what the N.R.A. does. 
KODAK Scare the shit out of 'em? 
A.J. Yeah. 
KODAK I can do that. 
A.J. Lewis, we want you to be legislative liaison on this. You're gonna run the show on the hill. 
LEWIS Can I just say, to return to the subject for one moment, that it might be easier to fight a war on drugs if we weren't arming drug dealers. 
SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a temper. 
SHEPHERD Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights we can win. 
LEWIS Yes, sir. 
A.J. We want to announce the crime bill at the State of the Union, which is 72 days from today. The last nose count put us 18 votes short. 
SHEPHERD Eighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you, everyone. Janie, what's next? 
A.J. Thank you, Mr. President. 
The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank you, Mr. President"'s as they exit. 
JANIE Security briefing, sir.

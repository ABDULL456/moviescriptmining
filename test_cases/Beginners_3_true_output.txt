Oliver sits as HAL lays in a coma on a ventilator. The room is dark, Oliver uses a flashlight to quietly read to his father. 
INT. ICU ROOM - DAY 
QUICK CUTS. A nurse opens the shades. A DOCTOR and two nurses stand over Hal, everyone's nervous. Hal is struggling with all the tubes down his throat. Oliver is trying to help him breathe, talking into his ear. Oliver is ushered out of the room. The nurse draws the curtain. MOMENTS LATER: Oliver sits with Hal, now off the ventilator but still very weak and disoriented. Oliver coaches his breathing. 
OLIVER Calm. Calm, calm breaths. Hal coughs. 
INT. ICU ROOM 
It's the middle of the night, Hal is connected to many I.V.s in both arms, still disoriented, he's tangled up in the tubes, trying to pull them out of his arms. He wakes up Oliver. 
HAL Oliver! Please help me with all these ropes. Oliver rushes and helps him. 
OLIVER Pop, Pop, stop -- you're gonna hurt yourself. A NURSE quickly enters and helps hold down his arms. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NURSE Mr. Fields, we're going to have to secure your arms again. 
She puts his hands in restraints, Oliver helps. 
HAL You two married? 
OLIVER No, Pop. 
HAL Why not? She's great. The nurse smiles, embarrassed, and continues with her job. 
OLIVER She's a great nurse in the hospital, we don't really know her, you're very high on drugs. 
HAL You always have some very good reason, haven't you? 
OLIVER No, Pop, I just don't want to be like you and mom. (aside to the nurse) Thank you... 
CUT TO PAST 
INT. OLIVER'S CHILDHOOD HOME 1978 
IN THE KITCHEN: We see 10-year-old Oliver watching his mother GEORGIA and father kiss quickly, politely, and then his father leaves quickly. Hal remains in silhouette through the shot. DIFFERENT DAY, IN OLIVER'S BEDROOM: Oliver watches Hal and Georgia kiss, and Hal leave - more like a performance than anything real. DIFFERENT DAY, IN PARENT'S BEDROOM: Oliver watches Hal and Georgia kiss and Hal exit, quick and dry. 10-year-old Oliver studies them each time. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIFFERENT DAY, OLIVER'S BEDROOM: Georgia quickly opens the door and finds Oliver drawing. 
GEORGIA Oliver! He turns and Georgia shoots him with her finger, Oliver falls to the ground. 
GEORGIA Olly, you can do better. He gets up and she shoots him again - He falls more dramatically, knocking his head on the floor. 
GEORGIA That's good. His mom looks at him affectionately. 
CUT TO PRESENT 
EXT. ECHO PARK STREET - NIGHT 
Oliver walks Arthur across a lit field, towards the dog park. 
EXT. DOG PARK - NIGHT 
Everywhere dogs and their people are playing. Oliver and Arthur sit on a bench like two humans. Oliver watches the action, Arthur stares at Oliver. 
OLIVER (CONT'D) Go have your own experiences with your own people. I'll be right here... Arthur stays by Oliver's side. 
OLIVER (CONT'D) I'm a human. I'm not a dog. And you're a Jack Russell, that's a breed. Your personality was created by this guy John Russell, a hunting enthusiast, in the 1800s. And he bred your ancestors to have stamina and courage for the hunt. You think you're just you, and you want to chase the foxes, but other people planted that in you years ago.

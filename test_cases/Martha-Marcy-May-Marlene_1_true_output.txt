INT. FARM/BEDROOM - DAY 
Martha and Zoe sit in bed. 
MARTHA Zoe? 
ZOE Yeah. 
MARTHA I can't stop feeling terrible for that poor man. 
ZOE I know. It happens though, we're never really dead or alive, we just exist, so he's still existing, but it's in a parallel time. Just don't think about it, it's in the past. 
Martha is upset with how cold Zoe is. 
INT. FARM HOUSE BATHRROM - LATER 
Martha sits in the bathroom, knees pulled up to her chest as she rests on the edge of the bathtub. 
Someone knocks at the door. She pretends not to be in there. There is another gentle know. 
ZOE Martha, it's me, can I come in? 
Martha unlocks the door for Zoe. Patrick bursts in, slams the door and corners Martha and yells at her. 
PATRICK Haven't you learned anything? 
MARTHA I have. 
PATRICK I felt like we had a connection. 
MARTHA (DESPERATE) We do! 
PATRICK That's not what you're showing me. 
Patrick calms down. He sits. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Maybe I asked too much from you too soon. You have potential but you're just not there yet. I'll expect less of you fro now on. 
Martha is upset, like a trained animal, she runs back to his side, sits next to him and rests her head on his shoulder. 
MARTHA I'm sorry. 
He runs his hand through her hair. 
PATRICK Shhh. It's okay. 
He puts his hand on the inside of her thigh. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) You're my favorite, I won't lose you. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Martha wakes up on the couch confused, she sees a man standing over her. She quickly pushes him up, jumps over tyhe back of the couch and runs away. 
The man is Ted. He follows her, trying to calm her down but she is in a blind state of panic. 
She runs to the stairs. He follows her. She trips. He goes to see if she is okay. She kicks him. He falls down the stairs. 
The lights turn on. Lucy comes out of the bedroom to see Ted at the bottom of the stairs. She rushes over to him.

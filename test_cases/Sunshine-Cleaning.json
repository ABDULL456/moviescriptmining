She passes small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights. \nOn the   highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a tangle   of rust and turquoise ramps. The Sandia mountains rise in the   distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods of the   foothills. \n2   EXT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - DAY                                     2 \nRose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and parks. She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies. \n3   INT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       3 \nRose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor collides with the debris of a recent party. \nShe collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and house plants. Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses. \nRose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding glass doors. A group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool. \nA lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer. \nHe brushes past Rose on his way back out. Rose turns on the vacuum and wonders if he even saw her. \n4   INT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                   4 \nThe space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable.

See, if we're talking that kind of volume I can absolutely massage the numbers a little. Seriously, you're not gonna be able to keep it on the shelf. \nJoe pulls out some order forms. \nOWNER Yeah, I'd need to look at some things before I can place an order. \nThe owner looks at Joe's business card. \nOWNER How about I give you a call if I decide to-- \nJOE I'll call you. Not a problem. No problem at all. Even better, I'll swing by. You're on my route. How `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow. \nOWNER Yeah, tomorrow's not good. \nJOE Thursday then. That's better anyway. That'll give you a chance to take a look see on those other stores. We'll put everything on one order and get you a good price break. \nThe owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves. \nJOE My advice to you - weed out some of this weaker product to make more space for the corn. Like this... \nJoe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar. \nJOE Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright idea was it to stock that? I mean come on, what self respecting kid asks his mom for apricot fruit leather? \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07     2A. 4   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  4 \nThe owner is not amused. \n5   EXT.

LUCKY BOY RESTAURANT - DAY                                 6 \nThrough the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress, NORAH LORKOWSKI (25). She appears to be in a heated argument with MR. KIM, the restaurant owner. A customer watches the exchange with amusement. \nNorah takes off her apron, throws it at Mr. Kim. Norah exits the restaurant. Mr. Kim trails her. Then MRS. KIM notices and joins the fray. \nMR. KIM You are fired. \nNORAH I so don't care. \nNorah flips him off and walk down the street. As she continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might not have been the best decision ever. \nNORAH Fuck. \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07        3. \n7    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                          7 \nA banana floats in the toilet. OSCAR LORKOWSKI, 7, smiles and kicks the flush lever. Whoosh... the banana is sucked down the drain. Gone. \nWell, not quite. Oscar watches water fill the basin and spill onto the floor. Oscar turns and walks out. \n8    INT.

BUSINESSMAN'S CAR -   SPORTING GOODS STORE LOT - DAY        9 \nA BUSINESSMAN removes a single shotgun shell from the glove compartment. He drops it in his shirt pocket, sprays breath freshener in his mouth and gets out of his car. \nNORAH It was just Mr. Kim being a dick head. \nROSE I thought you liked Mr. Kim. \nNORAH Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started working there. Now he's a full on gym teacher, I swear to God. \nROSE When are you going to grow up and start taking responsibility for-- \nNORAH Oh please, you love it when I fuck up. Love it. Me screwing up gives you the hugest woody. \nROSE Shut up and take the ten. \nNorah takes the ten. Rose looks at the TV. \nNORAH There was a diner scene earlier. With a waitress. \nRose looks at Norah. \nROSE Any pie? \nNorah smiles and opens the door to leave. \nNORAH Completely pie free. \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07        13. \n21   INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                      21 \nRose wraps the vacuum cleaner cord while another MOLLY MAID wipes down the last window. \nThrough the window, a smartly dressed pregnant woman walks toward the house with shopping bags in hand. \nMOLLY MAID The lady's here. \nRose nods and heads downstairs. \n22   INT.

Rose enters with the vacuum cleaner in tow. \nROSE We're all finished. Since it's our first visit we did the blinds and appliances but normally we'll alternate those weekly. Nobody mentioned anything to us about laundry so we didn't bother with that but if you want laundry included there is an extra... \nPAULA Rose? Rose Lorkowski? \nStartled, Rose looks the woman in the eye for the first time. \nPAULA It's Paula Datzman... cheerleading squad junior year. \nRecognition punches Rose in the face. \nROSE Paula Datzman. Wow. \nAwkward silence. \nROSE How are you? \nPAULA Great!

We're expecting our second in a couple of months. \nPaula pats her swollen belly and Rose forces a smile. \nPAULA How are you? You look just the same. \nROSE I'm good. Really good! \nPAULA God, I always envied you so much. Head cheerleader... dating the quarterback... So did you and Mac end up getting married? \nROSE Nope. No. (Awkward silence) I'm not sure...I think he ended up marrying Heather Volkman. \nPAULA Wow. Well it's so good to see you. Let me get your info so I can send you an invite to the baby shower. \nPaula gets a piece of paper and a pen and hands it to Rose. \nPAULA It'll be like a big reunion. The whole gang from high school will be there. \nRose writes her number and address on the scrap of paper. \nPAULA So what are you doing now? \nWoops. Paula immediately regrets the question. \nROSE I...

The card has a picture of Paula's smiling face. \nPAULA With Long and Foster. Who are you with? \nOscar steps closer. Joe twists something on the binoculars and pushes the lenses closer together to accommodate Oscar's small face. Better. \nJOE Those were your grandma's. She'd watch birds with those. \nOscar walks around the room examining various objects and clunks them against a lamp in the process. \nJOE Hey, hey. Careful. \nJoe holds out his hand to retrieve the binoculars. \nJOE Why don't we put those away. \nOscar doesn't want to. He hesitates. Joe raises an eyebrow. Oscar shuffles back to his grampa and hands them over. \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07       19A. 28   CONTINUED:                                                       28 \nOSCAR Why can't I play with them? \nJOE Because it's not a toy. It's a scientific instrument. \nOscar's disappointed. \nJOE You can play with them when I'm around to supervise. \nOSCAR You're around now. \nJOE I'm tired now. \nJoe studies the binoculars for a moment and then sets them back on the shelf. \n29   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                              29 \nRose shakes her head and hands Norah another dish. \nROSE Well I'm not putting him in special ed. I'll figure out a way to put him in private school before I do that. \nNORAH Rose, you buy generic cigarettes with couch change. How are you gonna pay for private school? \nJOE Who's going to private school? \nRose turns and sees her dad leaning in the door way. \nROSE Nobody dad, we're just talking. \nJOE Oscar get suspended again? \nYes, that's it. \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07       19B. 29    CONTINUED:                                                       29 \nJOE The kid's a little strange.

FAIR AND SQUARE - DAY                                       29A \nOscar rides a mechanical horse. \nRose pushes a cart down the isle and dials her cell phone. She grabs a box of cereal and tosses it in her cart. \n30    INT. MAC'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                    30 \nMac sits at the table with a cup of coffee and reads the paper.

FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                          31 \nThe Lorkowski family dines in style. \nROSE (O.S.) Are you even listening? \nNorah turns to face Rose at the other side of the table. \nNORAH No thanks. \nROSE What do you mean `no thanks'? What else do you have to do? You don't have a job. You don't go to school. What, are you going to live with Dad the rest of your life? \n39   EXT.

The BARTENDER smiles. \nBARTENDER Hey Joe, what you got for me? \nJOE World's finest corn snack. \nJoe hands the canister to the bartender and sits down on a stool. The bartender pours him a beer. \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07        23. 40   CONTINUED:                                                        40 \nBARTENDER See where old Miller's house sold? \nJoe nods. A grizzled REGULAR nearby looks over at Joe. \nREGULAR Bet you could get a chunk of change for your place. You should cash out now before the market turns sour. \nJoe shakes his head. \nJOE I'm not selling my house. No way. I don't care how much those idiots would shell out for it. I got history in that house. You think they understand about history? \nREGULAR Still... How much commission you get on that popcorn? Bet you gotta sell a lot of corn to- \nJOE Hey, the corn's good. Really good. Not like the pet food but that was a phenomenon. \nThe bartender sets a basket of cheddar popcorn in the space between Joe and the grizzled regular. \nJOE It'll get there. Takes time to get to know the market. Develop a relationship with the buyers. But it'll get there. Who doesn't like popcorn for Christ's sake. \nREGULAR My brother-in-law's in sales. \nThe regular scoops up a handful of powdery orange popcorn. \nREGULAR Last year he buys a cow. \nJOE Why would you buy a cow? \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07         24. 40   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   40 \nREGULAR Not a live cow. A whole butchered cow from a rancher. On the hoof they call it. \nJOE Mm hmm. \nJoe looks at him with renewed interest. \nREGULAR He sells off the parts of this cow to a bunch of restaurants. Direct. Made a killing. \nThe grizzled man licks orange powder from his fingers. \nJOE What'd he do with the brains and intestines? \nRegular shrugs. Joe's wheels are turning. \nJOE So he cuts out the middle man. Not a bad idea. \nJoe takes a drink of his beer while he mulls it over. \nJOE Course it'd be smarter to do that with something that didn't have bad parts. Like... shrimp. \n41   EXT.

The thing tips and falls on Norah. \n52   INT. MALL - CANDY STORE - DAY                                         52 \nTucked inside a mall, the candy store does brisk business. Pimple-faced clerks ring up clumps of overweight families. \nOscar pretends to look at hard candies while he listens to Joe and the MANAGER. \nMANAGER You're telling me this Fancy Corn stuff is some kind of health food? \nJOE Well, it's a candy... and a health food. Absolutely. Absolutely. \nMANAGER Yeah, I don't know. We don't have much more shelf space. \nOscar spots a GIRL perusing wax lips. She looks to be about five or six. Joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients off a Twizzler package. \nJOE Glycerol monostearate? What is that? I can't even read that. \nJoe spins a can of Fancy Corn around and points to the ingredients. \nJOE Read that. \nThe manager leans close. \nMANAGER High fructose-- \nJOE No. The first thing listed.

Can you think of anything more wholesome? It's all American for Christ's sake. \nThe manager's not buying it. Oscar takes action. He positions himself next to the girl. \nOSCAR Do you know if they sell fancy corn here? \nThe girl looks at him suspiciously. \nOSCAR Do you even know what fancy corn is? \nGIRL Yes. \nOSCAR Well, do they sell it here? \nGIRL I dunno. \nShe looks back to the lips and tries to ignore Oscar. \nOSCAR I heard that the strawberry fancy corn gives you bionic strength. \nGIRL That's stupid. \nOSCAR It's true. Some kind of chemical in the strawberry flavoring. If you eat a whole lot of it, it gives you bionic strength. \nThe girl gives Oscar a long stare. \nGIRL I don't believe you. \nOSCAR I don't care if you do or not. \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07       28B. 52   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 52 \nThe girl watches him for a moment and then walks over and tugs her mother's shirt. \nJOE I read where these chemicals are getting into the streams, making hermaphrodidic frogs! You think mothers want to expose their kids to that stuff? No way. More and more people are looking for healthy alternatives which is why the demand for this product is so huge right now. \nMANAGER Like I said, I already put in all the orders I want for this year. \nJust then, the GIRL'S MOTHER walks up to the manager. \nGIRL'S MOTHER Excuse me.

Rose and Norah work on the last remaining piles of trash. \nNORAH It seems wrong though doesn't it... to throw everything away. \nRose tosses a tattered fanny pack onto the heap in the garbage can. Norah plucks it out and opens it. \nNorah pulls out a PHOTO ID. She holds it up. The woman on the ID looks street-worn and crazy. \nNORAH I bet this is her. \nMAC I can't believe you... I mean, I feel like I got you into this mess. \nHer sense of pride wilts.

You can drive people around all day and talk about... Gosh, what would you talk about? (Suddenly very serious) Crown molding? \nRose smiles. Apparently it's some private joke. \nROSE Oh yeah, definitely talk about crown molding. \nThe phrase seems to send a ripple of pleasure through Mac. \nROSE Property easements, square footage, appliances... \nMac reacts to each word as if it were some filthy sex talk. He looks at Rose and raises an eyebrow. \nMAC You're holding out on me. \nRose rolls her eyes and laughs. \nROSE Freak. \nMAC Say it. Come on. One time. \nShe smiles and shakes her head. Mac waits. Rose relents. \nROSE Curb appeal. \nMac growls and pounces on Rose. It's fun and light. Rose laughs while Mac makes a show of mauling her neck. \nHe falls on the bed and reaches out. Rose takes his hand. It's rough against hers. There's a circular indentation where his wedding ring isn't. \nRose stops laughing. She touches the invisible ring. \nROSE Why'd you pick her? \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07        35. 58   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  58 \nMac looks up.

A small TV on the front counter offers up a not-so-classic afternoon movie line up. \nAs they approach, the clerk drops out of sight behind the counter. Rose leans over to see the clerk on his knees searching for something small and lost. \nROSE Winston? \nWINSTON, 35, crudely handsome with dark unkempt hair and full lips, looks up. \nROSE I spoke with you on the phone. I'm Rose Lorkowski. \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07        36. 60   CONTINUED:                                                            60 \nRose sticks out her right hand. \nWinston stands to reveal he is missing his right arm. He clumsily shakes her hand with his left. \nROSE So, our situation is... \nOn the TV, a waitress enters the frame. Rose stops. She and Norah both turn and look at the TV. \nThe waitress pours coffee and exits the frame without a word. Rose and Norah turn back to Winston. Rose continues. \nROSE We're doing some postmortem kind of um... specialized cleaning stuff and we had this really difficult... \nNORAH Smelly. \nRose looks at Norah and nods. \nROSE I'll drop Oscar by around seven. \nNORAH (sarcastically) You have class tonight? \nRose smiles uncomfortably. \nROSE Mortgage lenders and financing. \nNorah shakes her head in disgust. \nNORAH Heather's pregnant again. Did you know that? He's never going to leave her. \nRose clenches her jaw and picks at a crack in the steering wheel. Norah gets out of the car. \nNORAH God, you're pathetic. \nNorah slams the door and watches Rose drive off. \nNorah stands at the door well and scans the apartment number listings. She sees the name she's looking for, LYNN WISEMAN. \nJust then, LYNN, the woman from the photos, opens the door and walks past. Caught off guard, Norah follows her. \nGREEN REVISION 3/5/07        40. \n64   FOLLOWING THROUGH STREETS                                          64 \nThey walk several blocks, Norah keeping a safe distance behind Lynn. \n65   EXT.

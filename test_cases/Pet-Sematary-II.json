Goyer \nBased upon characters created by Stephen King \nTHIRD DRAFT \nRevised 1/6/91 \n\"PET SEMATARY II\" \nFADE IN: \nINT.  LEMARCHE CASTLE, TOMB - NIGHT (1865) \nA storm is raging outside. We hear the clap and roll of THUNDER. \nTOMB STAIRWAY - \nRATS scurry away down the scum-covered steps as the GLOW OF A LANTERN and FOOTSTEPS herald someone's arrival... \nGENVIEVE LEMARCHE \nemerges around the bend. Mid-30s. Cultured beauty. Her dress and face are smeared with grime and... is that blood we see too? God only knows what's happened to her. \nGenvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open window. \nWINDOW \nLIGHTNING streaks across the night sky outside. We catch a glimpse of the MOON disappearing behind the clouds. \nGenvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs. The tomb itself. \nWater trickles in through cracks in the lichen-covered walls, pooling on the tomb floor. \nGenvieve moves forward, her lantern throwing distorted shadows over everything... \nIn front of her is Anton LeMarche's stone sarcophagus. Genvieve kneels in the water, one hand resting on the spiked iron railing which surrounds the tomb. She reaches the other hand towards a scum-covered plaque, brushing the grime away... \nTHUNDER and LIGHTNING reach a crescendo as... \nA SKELETAL HAND rises out of the water, reaching for her. \nGenvieve SCREAMS. The lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering out. The hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her breast instead... \nGenvieve starts to laugh hysterically. \nDIRECTOR (O.S.) (exasperated) Cut! Thank you, Renee. Can we throw some light on the set? \nGENVIEVE I'm sorry... \nSuddenly it is lighter. Genvieve can't stop laughing. The groping monster hand disappears back beneath the water. \nWE PULL BACK, REVEALING - \nIt's not 1865. The LeMarche Castle tomb is in fact, a 90s movie set. We are inside a soundstage, on a raised set, so the slugline should really read... \nINT.  SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET - \nA FILM CREW scurries about. Everyone is LAUGHING now. The DIRECTOR sits to the right. He and the DP are already huddled over the video-assist monitor. We see the previous scene rewinding at high- speed. \nThe FIRST A.D. moves in. \nFIRST A.D. Water in the pool's running low, fill her up! \nCrewmembers move towards the set. \nAn SFX PUPPETEER (i.e., the skeletal arm) crawls out from under, followed by an ELECTRICIAN. \nPUPPETEER I can't see shit down there! I'm working blind! \nGENVIEVE/THE ACTRESS \nrises out of the water. Her name is actually RENEE HALLOW and her beauty is undeniable, even in such a disheveled state. \nRENEE This is great, I could've spent four months on a romantic comedy with Warren Beatty, and instead, I've got a horny zombie trying to cop a feel! \nThe crew members LAUGH. She's well-liked on the set. Renee grins. Wardrobe and make-up personnel move in to adjust Renee's appearance. \nRENEE Uhgh, there's water everywhere... (beat) Can I get a cigarette? \nThe MAKE-UP GIRL pulls a pack of cigarettes from her fanny-pack and offers Renee one. In a flash, a P.A. appears with a lighter. Renee mumbles \"thanks\" as she fires up. She squints her eyes, trying to see past the set lights. \nRENEE (calling out) Geoff? (beat) Anybody see my boy? \nCrewmembers SCREAM and scramble back... \nAll the circuits are blowing, lights EXPLODING and showering sparks over the whole set. This is not part of the movie. \nRENEE \nIt's awful. She shakes, her SMOKING HANDS frozen to the iron railing by the electricity running through her... \nSuddenly, Renee falls forward against the iron. Her face begins to SMOKE AND SINGE... \nThe lights CONTINUE TO BLOW, casting a strobic effect over the soundstage, adding to the chaos. \nON GEOFF \nAs he witnesses the whole event. He tries to rush forward, but someone restrains him... \nGEOFF Mom!!!! \nSuddenly all the circuits in the stage are blown and the LIGHTS GO OUT. Renee slumps back into the water, smoke trailing up from her still form. And we... \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED (SCENES 2 THRU 2J) \nINT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY \nAn aged GOLDEN RETRIEVER is on the surgical table. CHASE MATTHEWS, D.V.M., gently strokes the dog's fur. He's good with the dog. He's kind. The retriever's owners: a MOTHER and her SON, look on. \nCHASE I think this is probably for the best. He's a very old dog. He has arthritis. He has cataracts in his eyes... \nChase looks at the mother. He's always hated this part. \nCHASE He's had a good life... (to dog) ...haven't you, boy? \nINTERCOM Doctor Matthews, your son is on line one. He says it's an emergency... \nChase breaks concentration, pulling his eyes away from the mother and son. \nINT.  SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET - \nA blur of activity converges on the movie set. A TRIO OF PARAMEDICS. A FIRE OFFICIAL. A POLICE OFFICER. Medical equipment. Horrified crewmembers watch on, helpless. \nWE STAY ON Geoff, momentarily blocked out and then revealed again and again, amidst the commotion of paramedics scrambling to save Renee. The director has his hand on Geoff's shoulder. \nGeoff's eyes dart about, taking it all in. Things are happening very fast: \n--Renee's hand is lifted. Someone checking her pulse. --Her eyelids parted. A pen light flashing at her fixed pupils. \nPARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.) Run me down a line of normal saline. \n--An I.V. needle plunges into the inside of Renee's elbow. --A syringe injects into the I.V. post. \n--Hands hook up a life-pack monitor. Renee's dress is torn away. Electrodes press to bare skin. --The monitor screen blinks to life. \nPARAMEDIC (O.S.) We have a bradycardic rhythm at \n--Another PARAMEDIC dials out on a cellular phone, to the consulting physician. \nPARAMEDIC #3 (O.S.) White female. Approximately thirty five years old. Electrocution... \n--A clear tube is inserted down her throat. --The monitor shows erratic heartbeat. \nPARAMEDIC #2 (O.S.) She's in V-fib. \n--There's a renewed urgency even amidst their rush. \n--Defibrillator paddles are pressed to her chest. \nGeoff looks to the monitor as... \n--It goes to flatline. \nPARAMEDIC (O.S.) Clear. \nGEOFF No... \nGeoff moves forward, pulling away from the director. The police officer moves in and intercepts Geoff, turning the boy away. \nGeoff's eyes fix on the monitor. An unbending flatline... \nGEOFF You have to bring her back... \nChase rushes onto the set, pushing past crewmembers. He freezes at the sight of the horrific commotion around Renee's still form. \nCHASE Oh Jesus... \nChase's gaze connects with his son. \nGEOFF (helpless) Dad... \nGus glances at Geoff. \nGUS I hear you moved into town. \nCHASE I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know? \nGus nods. Now his eyes fall on Renee's headstone. \nGUS I remember when Renee left. She couldn't wait to get out of Ludlow. She used to say that life moved too slow here... \nChase forces a smile. \nCHASE That's Renee alright. \nGUS I suppose so. \nThe sky above seems heavy with imminent rain and we... \nCUT TO: \n12    OMITTED THRU 15    OMITTED \nEXT.  HOUSE - DAY \nLazy oaks embrace a vintage, two-story Victorian home in the rural neighborhood of Ludlow, Maine. A commercial MOVING VAN is parked out front. \nMarjorie, the girl we saw at Renee's funeral, is coming down the sidewalk. She checks the address on the front of the house, then heads up the driveway. \nINT.  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY \nMoving boxes clutter the downstairs. \nChase is weaving through the maze, doing an inventory on the boxes. \nA sweaty PAIR OF MOVERS are climbing up the stairs. Each is hunched  over, with a garment box balanced on his back. The side of each carton is boldly labeled: RENEE - ATTIC. \nMOVER (O.S.) We've got six more of these. You sure you want them all in the attic? \nChase is contemplating a compromise when Geoff appears from the kitchen doorway. \nCHASE ...Geoff, what if we just give the clothes to Goodwill? We'll keep the rest. Just the clothes. \nGeoff shakes his head, firm and deliberate denial. \nGEOFF You're the one who wanted to move. Nobody would've touched them if you didn't want to move here... \nChase weakens, giving in. \nCHASE All the 'Renee' boxes go in the attic. Sorry. \nMarjorie KNOCKS on the open frame of the front door. \nGeoff recognizes her from his mother's funeral. She flashes him a warm smile. \nMARJORIE Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove. Your new housekeeper. \nMarjorie has a naive, friendly quality about her. She's also blessed with eye-popping genetics. Standing there outside the door, looking more than a little nervous... we can't help but like her. Needless to say, she doesn't look like your typical housekeeper. \nMARJORIE (re: Chase's reaction) Is something wrong? \nCHASE Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in. \nMarjorie enters. She grins at Geoff again. Yep. She's nervous alright. \nMARJORIE I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews... \nCHASE Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way. \nMarjorie passes her curious eyes over one of Renee's garment containers. \nMARJORIE I've always admired Ms. Hallow. That scene she did in Blue Midnight, where her lover meets her at the train station... (she sighs) I must've watched that movie four times. \nChase smiles. Marjorie's enthusiasm is endearing. \nJust then, one of the movers loses his grip. A garment box bounces down the slope of the stairs. When it reaches the bottom, dresses spill over the floor. \nMARJORIE Oh. I'll get that... \nMarjorie moves for the spill. The first dress she touches is a beaded peach evening gown. Her fingers linger on the fabric. \nMARJORIE This is gorgeous. She wore this at the Emmys, didn't she? \nGeoff moves forward, acting overly defensive. \nGEOFF Hey, don't touch her stuff. It made her crazy when people touched her stuff. \nMarjorie is taken aback by the oddity of Geoff's statement. \nChase catches her eye, shrugging apologetically. \nTiger scampers by as Chase coughs his way out of the cloud of dust. \nINT.  WAITING AREA \nTiger sees the front door ajar. And as she approaches to explore what lies beyond-- \nThe door swings open... \nZOWIE, A SIBERIAN HUSKY is staring back at her. He's black and white with blue eyes, with a mask that is at once menacing and majestic. \nA pudgy thirteen year old boy, DREW, has a hold of the dog's collar. \nZowie's BARK sends Tiger scrambling. \nDrew loses his grip as Zowie yanks free. A strong, paternal command calls after Drew from outside. \nVOICE (O.S.) Drew, you get a handle on that dog, now! \nINT.  EXAMINATION ROOM \nChase spins around at the commotion as Tiger darts across the floor with the barking dog in pursuit. \nMayhem ensues as Zowie's big paws slip on the slick tile. \nGeoff rushes in from the boarding area. \nTiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney. \nZowie's snoot wedges beneath the base, inches from Tiger's tiny, striking paw. \nDrew slides in on his knees, renewing his hold on Zowie's collar. He pulls the dog back. \nGeoff rescues Tiger from beneath the gurney. \nDrew shrugs sheepishly. \nDREW Sorry. He gets kinda hyper... \nDrew's stepfather, Gus Gilbert, enters. The dreaded, domineering voice of authority in Drew's life. WE know him as the sheriff at Renee's funeral. \nGUS Hell, he thought it was lunch. How ya doin', Chase? (a handshake) You haven't met my boy. (aside) Drew, where the hell are your manners. \nDrew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to Chase. Then Geoff. The boys shake. \nGEOFF He's a cool lookin' dog. \nZowie lurches forward, eager to shower affection on Geoff. Geoff strokes the dog's soft mane. \nGEOFF What's his name? \nDREW Zowie. \nDrew puts his palm under Zowie's chin and turns him for Chase to see. There are several scabbed-over gashes on his left cheek. \nGUS Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot. \nDREW Is he gonna be okay? \nWith one eye on Zowie, Chase sprays some antiseptic on the examination table and wipes it clean. \nCHASE Let's have him hop up here. \nDrew prods Zowie. Zowie jumps up onto the table. Chase looks over the facial lacerations, then turns on a penlight and examines the dog's eyes. \nGus passes a lingering look over Tiger. He reaches in to pet her, making sure it meets with Geoff's approval. \nGUS When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys. \nCHASE There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes. \nDrew perks up at the thought, but Gus shoots it down. \nGUS Not our home. \nChase takes the light out of Zowie's eyes. He looks to Gus. \nCHASE Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream-- \nGUS --Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this? \nChase turns to Drew and continues... \nCHASE His left eye is scratched, corneal abrasion. Eyedrops will help, but it's going to take som time. Try to keep him away from those rabbits, huh? \nDrew nods, casting a glance aside at Gus. \nGUS (to Chase) I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now. \nCHASE How'd you know that? \nSusan shuts up. Geoff sinks even lower in his seat. \nThe kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room. \nBut one classmate's eyes are still on Geoff. It's Clyde. \nClyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in Geoff's jacket. He catches a glimpse of Tiger's bobbing nose popping out. \nINT.  HALLWAY - DAY \nGeoff joins the stampede of kids as the BELL releases them for the day. Almost immediately, Clyde and his cronies, STEVIE AND BRAD, fall in step behind him. Drew hangs slightly off to the side, not really wanting to be a part of the intimidation. \nCLYDE What's the hurry, Junior? Where you off to? \nClyde quickens his pace, pulling ahead of Geoff and stopping in front of him. Stevie and Brad move in on either side. Surrounded by peers, it's apparent how small Geoff is for his age. \nOn the wall next to them is a bulletin board display. Clyde glances at it. Geoff follows his gaze. \nDISPLAY \nIt's one of those corny school affairs with construction paper letters spelling out: \"WE REMEMBER RENEE HALLOW.\" Beneath that are pictures of Renee clipped from various magazines. Cloyingly tasteless. \nCLYDE (feigning remorse) Too bad about your Mom. Papers said it was pretty gross, getting fried like that. Guess you saw it, huh? \nGeoff nods. Clyde raises his eyebrows, pulling Geoff's jacket open. \nCLYDE So, what are you hiding there? \nSTEVIE When you bring a friend to school you're supposed to introduce him. \nGeoff's arm tightens protectively around Tiger. \nGEOFF Her name's Tiger. \nCLYDE Tiger? Don't you think that's kind of a pussy name? (reaching out) Can I hold her? I promise I'll be real careful. \nClyde has a convincing way about him. Geoff reluctantly hands the kitten over. Clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would never question his sincerity. \nGeoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in Clyde's tone, something sinister. \nCLYDE Hey, Geoff. You ever seen a kitten run? \nGEOFF I've seen her run around the house. \nClyde's eyes narrow. He takes a couple of steps back. Geoff's heart starts to sink. \nCLYDE No, I mean really run... (beat) Like this! \nClyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with Tiger. Brad and Stevie fall in behind him, laughing. \nDrew shrugs apologetically. He's torn, but he tears off after them nonetheless. \nGEOFF Shit... \nGeoff runs off in pursuit of them. \nEXT.  SCHOOL - DAY \nGeoff rushes from the building, searching the dispersing crowd. There they are, tearing from the bike racks, pedaling for the street. \nClyde sees Geoff and mockingly holds the kitten out for display as they ride by. \nGeoff runs for the bike racks. \nEXT.  ROAD - DAY \nClyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town, riding out onto the open road. \nClyde glances back toward the center of town. \nGeoff is so far behind he's barely visible. \nClyde returns his eyes to the road ahead, raising Tiger nose to nose with him. \nCLYDE Having fun yet? \nClyde and his smirking buddies ride on, OUT OF FRAME. \nWITH GEOFF \ngiving the pedals all he can, struggling to keep pace with the boys. \n35    OMITTED \nFURTHER ALONG \nScattered houses sprinkle the landscape ahead. Cochran Lake stretches into the distance beyond the housing. \nClyde's clan cuts from the road and blazes a trail across a residential property. The two-story house is weathered and boarded up. It looks vaguely familiar. Creepy. \nINT.  GUS' ROOM - NIGHT \nThe ELECTRICAL ZING. The dog's whimpering CRY. And the RINGING OF BELLS reach Gus in rapid succession, rousting him from his sleep. He rolls out of bed and grabs his robe. \nGUS Damn it, Drew. That dog is history! \nAmanda stirs, groggily focusing on Gus' departing figure. \nINT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT \nDrew swings open the door to the hallway as Gus marches by, stuffing shells into a shotgun. Panicked, Drew takes off after him. \nEXT.  RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT \nZowie swings his head in the direction of the house as Gus bursts through the back door. Drew is one step behind. \nGus swings the gun up and fires off a SHOT. \nZowie bolts for the shadows of the hillside. \nDrew rushes in and deflects the aim of the rifle. \nDREW Don't shoot him! \nGus' eyes are wild with anger. \nGUS What, Drew? What did you say?! \nGus throws Drew aside, brings the rifle back up and FIRES another random shot after the fleeing dog. All the while, his eyes remain on Drew, as if this were the boy's lesson to be learned. \nHe squeezes off one more SHOT... \nA PAINED YELP echoes from the hillside. Zowie's yelp. \nDrew whips his head aside in sickened shock. Even Gus is sobered by the unexpected hit. \nAll they can hear now are Zowie's WHIMPERING CRIES diminishing in the night. \nDrew shoots Gus a look of such unbridled hatred that Gus is speechless. He backs away from Gus and darts off toward the dark hillside. \nWhen Gus turns back for the house, Amanda is standing there. \nAMANDA Jesus, Gus, what have you done? \nGUS Ah, come on, Amanda, stop looking at me like that. He's had ample warning about that dog. \nAmanda glares at him, an outpouring of pent-up strain. \nGus defiantly marches past Amanda, entering the house without ever meeting eyes with her. \nEXT.  WOODS - NIGHT \nDrew pauses long enough to listen for Zowie... \nNothing until a FAINT CRY drifts back at him. \nDEEPER IN THE WOODS \nZowie limps INTO FRAME. Blood is flowing from the bullet wound in his left hindquarter, trailing from his suspended leg. Every step is a strain. \nDREW \ncomes upon a break in the trees. The hanging moon outlines the knoll stretching beyond. And then, the strained breathing, the hushed WHIMPER. \nDrew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll. \nZowie is just beyond, lying on his side at the end of the bloody trail. His chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every effort to survive. \nDrew drops to his knees at Zowie's side and cradles the dog in his lap, shaking his head in denial. \nZowie's weak eyes shift, gazing longingly at Drew. \nDrew strokes the fur under Zowie's chin, hardly able to see the dog through his glaze of tears. \nZowie's eyes drift off. His chest falls and doesn't rise again. He falls limp in Drew's arms. Drew hugs Zowie even tighter and he begins to weep. \nFROM A DISTANCE \nWE SEE the image of Drew with the dog cradled in his arms, silhouetted against the moonlit horizon. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n53    OMITTED \nEXT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - MORNING \nGeoff appears from the garage with his bike and takes off for the road. A WHISTLE catches his ear. \nDrew is at the edge of the woods, beckoning for Geoff. \nGeoff nods and hands over the digging tools. Drew swings the pickaxe, sinking it into the ground. \nGEOFF You want me to help? \nDREW You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule... \nBacking away from the burial ground, Geoff takes a seat on a rock at the border of the forest. From there, he watches. \nDrew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the rocky ground. \nWE MOVE IN ON GEOFF, who's looking on with skeptical intrigue as the rhythmic SOUND of the tools continues. \n59    OMITTED \nLATER - \nA cairn is complete: a conical pile of rocks over Zowie's grave. \nDrew is now sitting on the rock next to Geoff. Together, they stare at the cairn as if Zowie might climb from beneath at any moment. \nDREW What if he really does come back? \nGeoff shrugs, pondering such a thought. \nGeoff digs into his pocket and produces a pack of gum, offering one to Drew. With only a quick glance away from the grave, Drew snatches a piece and he stuffs it into his mouth. Geoff does the same. \nThey sit together in silence. Nervously chewing their gum. Watching the grave. \nDREW I've never had anyone die before... (beat) ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually... \nGEOFF (quietly) You never get over it. \nEXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - AFTERNOON \nThe sun dips over the horizon, giving way to dusk. \nEXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DUSK \nGeoff's eyes shift from the grave to the darkening sky. \nGEOFF It's getting pretty late. We better go. \nDREW (disappointed) Yeah... \nThey rise, leaving the burial ground. En route, Drew pauses for a last look at the grave. \nDREW So long, Zowie... \nGeoff follows, glancing back at the burial ground. It looks magical in the twilight, not quite so sinister now. \nEXT.  ROAD - NIGHT \nDrew is walking home along the road, alone. \nHeadlights blind him as a car approaches. It slows and pulls a U- turn, stopping at Drew's side. It's Gus' squad car. He pushes open the passenger door. \nGUS Get in. \nDrew takes a step back, shaking his head. \nGUS Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove? \nDREW I'm not trying to prove anything. (beat) I was burying my dog. \nGus turns his eyes away, focusing on the dark road ahead. \nGUS Life is full of lessons. No one's above it. Not you. Not me... Now get in the car. \nAfter a moment, Drew approaches the car. Without another word, Gus drives off. \n64    OMITTED \nEXT.  RABBIT CAGE - NIGHT \nIt's quiet now. And out of the silence comes the JINGLING of Zowie's dog tags. Zowie's LONG SHADOW creeps over the cage, distorted to monstrous proportion by the flickering light. \nWe move past the cages to the back porch... \nWe see ZOWIE'S PAW scratching at the door. \nINT.  AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAmanda wakens with a start. She rises, eyes focusing on the dark bedroom. Gus is sound asleep next to her. Then, from outside, we faintly hear ZOWIE'S SCRATCHING. \nSlowly, Amanda rises from bed, pulling on a bathrobe as she heads for the door. \nEXT.  BACK PORCH - NIGHT \nAmanda appears at the door. She unlatches it, stepping outside. \nDrew and the others quickly turn around, realizing it's not part of the punch-line scare. \n89    OMITTED THRU 91    OMITTED \nEXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT \nThe kids quickly scramble for hiding places in the bordering brush, dropping their beer cans as fast as they can. \nAs Drew leaps to his feet, he upsets the fire, knocking one of the logs. A FLAMING EMBER rolls to the base of one of the brittle old crosses. \nDrew and Geoff run for it. \nEXT.  PATH, ARCHWAY - NIGHT \nGus moves quickly up the meandering path, sending the blinding beam of his flashlight over the graves. \nGUS You boys better not be drinking! \nEXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT \nThrough the thick woods, Drew is flanked by Geoff and Clyde. \nDREW Oh man, he's gonna kick my ass... \nDrew starts to take off. Clyde trips him on his first stride. Drew hits the dirt. \nCLYDE Thanks for fucking up our Halloween, dumbshit! \nClyde recedes into the woods as Gus approaches the campfire. He scans the area with his flashlight, illuminating the various beer cans. \nGUS Drew, you get your ass out here! Front and center! \nGeoff pulls Drew to his feet. \nGus passes the flashlight over the woods. Kids duck away, retreating from their hiding places... \nThe flashlight sweeps toward Drew. \nDrew freezes, spotlighted by Gus' beam. A burst of LIGHTNING floods Drew's horrified face. \nGUS Get out here, Joker. \nGeoff remains frozen in the woods nearby, out of Gus' light. \nBehind Gus, the wooden cross is completely on fire now. \nGUS You out here making a fool of me? \nDrew shakes his head in instant denial. \nGUS I'm warning you, buddy! You don't play by the rules, I'm gonna shadow your ass for eternity! \nDrew makes a break from his spot in the woods. He weaves through the markers, arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid Gus... \n...but Gus is quicker. He zigzags through the crosses and headstones to intercept Drew. \nGus gets a handful of Drew's collar and yanks him in. \nGUS You little shit! \nGus draws his free arm back and smacks Drew across the face. Drew goes down. \nGEOFF \nis looking on from the woods, horrified. Torn... \nDREW \ncowers on the ground, trying to scramble away. \nGeoff bolts out into the firelight, staring defiantly at Gus in silent accusation. \nGus is beyond furious. LIGHTNING flashes again. \nGUS You get out of here, Geoff Matthews! This is between me and my boy! \nGeoff doesn't move. Gus starts to advance forward... \n...but the GROWL emanating from the woods gives him pause. Everyone turns... \nA RUSTLING is heard in the bushes, and Zowie emerges into the building firelight, flashing his fangs at Gus. His eyes GLOW RED. \nGus freezes, studying Zowie. \nZowie inches forward, poised for the attack. \nGUS Call off your dog, Drew. \nDrew shifts his eyes from Zowie to Gus, too terrified to heed such a command. \nDrew moves on past her into the house. \nAMANDA (calling after him) Drew? Drew, what happened? \nDREW (trying not to lose it) Nothing happened, Mom. We just ditched Gus, that's all... \nDrew pauses and stares out into the unknown darkness of the night. \nINT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nChase is in the study, perusing some files. He looks into the hallway as Geoff arrives home, then glances at the clock. It's late. Very late. \nChase rises. He's both angry and relieved. Right now, though, the anger's winning out. \nCHASE Were you drinking? \nGeoff absently shakes his head. He slumps back against the wall, drained from the night's horrors. \nCHASE Drew's Mom called hours ago, the rest of the kids were back by ten. Where the hell were you boys? \nGeoff shrugs, trying to mask his uneasiness. \nGEOFF Just out. \nCHASE \"Out.\" Well that's great, Geoff. (beat) Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again... \nGEOFF (cutting him off) I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep? \nChase stops and looks at his son. Geoff's exhaustion is self- evident. \nCHASE (sighing) Go on... we'll talk about this in the morning. \nGeoff nods and heads for the stairs. \nINT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT \nTHE CLOCK is creeping up on 2AM... \nTHUNDER rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter the window panes. \nGeoff's eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to sleep. Tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest. Slowly, we move back towards the window... \nIn a flash of LIGHTNING-- \nGUS' FACE \nAPPEARS OUTSIDE. Washed in the haunting white glow. Streaked with mud. Caked with blood. Staring in at Geoff. \nGeoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of THUNDER and whips his gaze to the window. Before he can focus... \n...the pulse of lightning fades away. And with it, Gus' face. Only darkness remains beyond the window pane. \nGeoff returns his gaze to the bedroom, unaware of Gus' appearance. He sinks back to his pillow, already hurtling towards sleep once more. \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMOVING IN ON the house, WE SINGLE OUT a rain-obscured window on the ground floor, the window to Drew's bedroom. \nINT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT \nDrew is sound asleep, curled up under the sheets. He clutches his pillow like a life preserver. \nGUS (O.S.) Drew! \nDrew's eyes flutter open. He turns towards the window. Now, he hears some activity outside. And then Gus' hushed voice. \nGUS (O.S.) Drew, buddy. I lost my keys. \nDrew goes saucer-eyed. He swallows the swelling lump in his throat and rises from his bed. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDrew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key into the deadbolt on the back door. Drawing the CREAKING door open, he gazes out back. \nDREW (scared shitless) Gus? \nNothing moves outside. The longer Drew watches, the more eerie each shadow becomes. Spooked, Drew steps back inside, quickly closing the door. He locks it back up again. \nWhen he turns around, he's face to face with GUS. \nDrew stiffens, backing into the wall. \nDREW H-how'd you get in? \nGus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand, dangling his keys. \nGUS Found 'em. \nDrew's eyes follow a flow of blood from Gus' neck to the floor. Gus looks down at his dirty, bloody footprints. He's tracked blood all over the linoleum. \nCHASE Take your pick. They're in the boarding area. You can go on back. \nChase turns away as his phone call is answered. \nCHASE Elliot, it's Chase... \nINT.  LAB/INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE (INTERCUT) - DAY \nELLIOT RUDMAN has the phone tucked under his chin, in the midst of an autopsy. The WHIRR of the saw drowns out his words as he shaves the dome off a dog's skull. \nCHASE I didn't get that... \nThe pathologist turns off the saw. His words become audible. \nRUDMAN ...I said next time it might help if you took the blood sample while the animal was still alive... \nThe comment hits Chase out of left field. \nCHASE What? \nRUDMAN I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death... \nCHASE Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive. \nRUDMAN Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea. \nChase is baffled, speechless. \nRUDMAN You took over for Doctor Yolander? \nCHASE Yes... why? \nRUDMAN Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander... \n110   OMITTED THRU 112   OMITTED \nINT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY \nThe kennels have been cleaned up, but the room retains its eerie, dimly lit quality. \nThe DRIP of a faucet reverberates from the far corner. \nThe mother enters with a toddler clinging to each hand. Their smiles fade at the unsettling surroundings. Slowly, they move down the row of kennels. \nTODDLER Where are the kitties? \nINT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY \nCHASE (into the phone) Look, this is ridiculous... \nSuddenly, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS pierce the air. Chase drops the phone and rushes out of the office... \nINT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY \nThe toddlers are screaming at the top of their lungs. Mom is burying their heads in her dress. \nChase bursts in as the mother hastily retreats for the exit. Her horrified eyes flash by Chase. In an instant, she and the toddlers are gone. \nChase remains alone, moving down the long row of kennels with mounting trepidation... \nZowie's cage is empty. \nChase shifts his troubled gaze to the... \nDRIP DRIP DRIP... as a PUDDLE OF BLOOD forms on the floor. \nChase raises his eyes... \nTHE KITTENS' KENNEL - \nNothing but bloody ribbons of torn flesh are left of the kittens, dangling from the grid gate. DRIPPING. \nChase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him. \nCHASE Jesus... \nIt's too gruesome even for a man of Chase's background. Fighting the gag reflex, he searches the room for the missing dog... \n...and then he spots the broken glass window vent along the floor. And the pile of blood-spattered shards laying on the tile. \nEXT.  SCHOOL, STREET - DAY \nClyde, Stevie, and Brad are loitering near the front bike racks. Clyde's smoking away. \nAs Geoff and Drew come out of the school, the trio moves to intercept them. \nCLYDE Hey! \nJust then, Chase's van pulls at the curb, interrupting whatever trouble was about to happen. \nYOLANDER There's no \"blood condition.\" The dog isn't sick, it's dead. (drawing closer) And so was Creed's cat. And so was his wife the night she was killed for the second time... \nAs Yolander moves forward, Chase backs up. He bumps into a whole shelf of stuffed creatures. To his right, A RAVEN sits frozen on its perch. Chase regards Yolander as being completely insane. \nYOLANDER (menacing) You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town. \nCHASE Well... uh... thanks... \nChase continues to back out of the door. On his way out, he bumps into the stuffed raven's perch... \n...only this raven isn't stuffed. It spreads its wings and SCREECHES. \nChase just about jumps out of his skin, tripping out of the doorway. \n116D  OMITTED THRU 116F  OMITTED \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nGus reaches into the cage and grabs a rabbit by the ears. He casually snaps the neck. Laying the limp carcass on a stump cutting board, he quickly skins it. \nHanging above the cages, there is now a line of furry pelts. Half a dozen. \nDrew and Geoff are on the porch, looking on. \nDREW I guess we're having rabbit for dinner. \nGus hangs the freshly skinned fur to dry and violently snatches another hare from the cage. \nINT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe dinner from Hell. Geoff splats a helping of mashed potatoes onto his plate, all the while keeping a wary eye on Gus... \nGus is serving himself a chunk of rabbit. It hits the edge of the plate, teetering on the rim. He passes the dish on. \nGus meets Geoff's gaze. For a moment, there's a deadened, vacant look in Gus' eyes. Then slowly, a limp smile creeps over him, sending a chill up Geoff's spine. \nGeoff averts Gus' stare. Gus helps himself to potatoes and passes the plate on. He lets go of it short of reaching Drew. Only Drew's quick hands save it from hitting the table. \nAmanda comes to the table with a dish of LIMA BEANS. She casts Gus a cold, hateful stare and sets the limas down. She's still angry over last night. \nGus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward Drew. Like before, he lets it drop too early. This time Drew doesn't save it. The lima beans shower the floor. \nAMANDA God damnit, Gus! This isn't funny! \nAmanda fetches a dishtowel and kneels to clean up the mess. \nGeoff and Drew exchange quick glances. As Geoff reaches for the salt... \n...Gus intercepts his wrist. Geoff gulps. \nGus drops his jaw, revealing a gooey mass of food. But the frozen smile and the look in his eyes convey dementia rather than playfulness. \nGeoff and Drew can't believe their eyes. They laugh uncomfortably. There's no other response. \nGus LAUGHS too... awkward, terrible laughter. Spitting out food over his shirt and plate as he does so. \nThe boys stop laughing, but Gus just keeps on going. \nAmanda stares at Gus and carries the mess out of the room. \nThrough his laughter, Gus' bandage has slipped down, exposing part of his ragged wound. The wound glistens, oozing CLOTTED BLOOD and GOOEY PUS. \nDrew hesitantly reaches for Gus' neck, readjusting the bandage. \nGrossed out, Geoff averts his eyes and sets his fork aside. \nINT.  DREW'S ROOM - LATER \nGeoff and Drew enter. Drew swiftly secures the deadbolts on his door. \nGEOFF What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us? \nDREW I don't know but I'm not taking any chances... \nDrew opens the chest at the foot of his bed and produces a SHOTGUN. A box full of shells spill as he withdraws the gun. Cracking open the chamber, Drew loads two shells into the chamber. \nEXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT \nA moonlit horizon. Unmoving. Silent. The kind of silence that pulls at the darkest recesses of imagination. \nAnd now, A LONE FIGURE appears on the horizon. It's Zowie, moving at a deliberate pace. \nATOP A KNOLL \nZowie takes pause. The TINKLING of his collar tags resumes as he drops over the horizon line, cutting down the hill. \nINT.  CHASE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nChase sits in the den, looking exhausted and disheveled. In front of him, the t.v. is on. RENEE'S FACE stares out at us. Chase hits the remote and rises, moving to the back door. \nChase is bare-chested at the mirror, applying a dressing to the dog bite on his shoulder. \nMarjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry. She stops short at the sight of Chase standing there in his boxers. \nChase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled. \nMARJORIE I didn't mean to... I was going to empty the hamper... \nChase turns, shaking off the scare. \nCHASE It's okay. \nMarjorie's eyes can't help but fix on the dog bites scattered over Chase's chest and arms. \nMARJORIE What happened to you? \nCHASE I had a little run-in with Zowie. \nMARJORIE You sure did... \nMarjorie sets the laundry aside. \nMARJORIE Here, let me do that... \nMarjorie looks over the antiseptics Chase has laid out on the sink. Saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide, she gently cleanses the gashes on his arms. \nThere's nothing overtly sexual in her actions, but the gentleness of her touch doesn't go unnoticed by Chase. \nMARJORIE I hope he doesn't have rabies. \nCHASE He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious... \nChase stops and looks at Marjorie's reflection in the mirror. \nCHASE Marjorie... what do you know about the Creed murders? \nMarjorie stiffens for a moment. Obviously the Creeds are a sore spot for the people in this town. \nMARJORIE Did you ever play that game where you pass a story down a row of people and see how screwed up it gets by the time it's done? People say Louis Creed's son came back from the dead and it drove him crazy... (she rolls her eyes) He killed his wife and himself, and that's the end of story. Anything else belongs in the National Enquirer. \nMarjorie tapes the bandage over Chase's shoulder too tight. Chase's groan snaps her back to the reality at hand. \nMARJORIE Sorry. Now tell me what that has to do with Zowie? \nChase closes his eyes, shutting out the pain. \nCHASE I wish I knew. \nINT.  LIBRARY - DAY \nChase approaches the counter, looking to the ELDERLY LIBRARIAN for assistance. \nLIBRARIAN What are you looking for, Hon. \nCHASE Do you have anything on the Creed murders? I can't find the microfilm from that period... \nThe librarian's smile vanishes. She lowers her voice, focusing her attention on some paperwork. \nLIBRARIAN We don't keep anything on file from that far back. \nCHASE But you've got files from the previous years... \nLIBRARIAN We have nothing on the Creed murders, sir. Can I get you something else? \nChase looks around and realizes that a dozen hostile eyes are on him. TOWNSPEOPLE withholding a dark secret. \nChase slowly backs away, eager to escape the field of hostile stares. \n127   OMITTED THRU 129   OMITTED \nEXT.  HIGHWAY, COUNTRY BRIDGE - DAY \nGeoff and Drew have parked their bikes beneath the bridge. They sit on the bank of the creek below, watching the water run past. Geoff is lost in thought. \nGEOFF Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus? \nDREW I don't know... (thinking) ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you... \nGEOFF (finishing) Dies? \nDrew nods. He tosses a stone into the creek, then looks up at the sun and sighs. \nDREW I gotta go back and do my chores... \nGEOFF Go later... \nDrew shakes his head. \nDREW I can't. Gus'd kill me if I showed up late. \nGUS Go home. \nBut Geoff remains frozen. Gus fixes him with a stare that could turn flesh to stone. \nGUS I said... GO HOME!! \nGeoff snaps out of it and flips his bike over. He gets a running start, making a beeline for the highway without ever looking back. \nON THE KNOLL NEARBY \nDrew stops short of the ravine, watching from afar as Gus steps toward Clyde. \nBELOW - \nClyde throws up his hands. He's frightened, but he tries to muster up a cocky front. \nCLYDE Come on, Gus, I was just fucking with him... (nervous laughter) What're you gonna do? Give me a ticket? I mean, shit, Gus... \nClyde grows increasingly wary of Gus' evil stare. Gus steps closer. \nCLYDE You can't lay a finger on me... \nWrong. Gus lashes out, backhanding Clyde across the face. \nClyde falls to the ground, flat on his back, with his nose gushing blood. Terrified. \nGus turns around and lifts the idling motorcycle. With one hand under the back of the seat, and the other working the accelerator handlebar, Gus advances toward Clyde. \nGus kicks the bike into gear and REVS the accelerator. \nTHE REAR WHEEL SPINS. On the pavement it would be moving forty miles an hour. \nClyde can't believe his eyes. Pleading. \nCLYDE Gus... what are you doing? \nGUS I'm just fucking with you... \nGus plants his foot against Clyde's chest, pinning him, and lowers the spinning rear wheel TOWARD CLYDE'S NECK. The wheel WHINES like a circular saw. \nGus lowers the wheel. Then jerks it away, flashing a sadistic smile. \nJust when Clyde thinks Gus is backing off, the wheel comes down again... \nCLYDE (wailing) Stop it, man! Stop it!!! \nGus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning wheel at the terrified bully. \nBut this time, as the wheel comes down... \nCLYDE'S WOOL SCARF, defying gravity, gets swept up, swallowed into the GEARS. \nAnd along with the scarf, here comes Clyde's SCREAMING face. We can only imagine the gruesome instant that follows. \nBLOOD sprays up over Gus' arms and chest. And then we hear the sound of CRUNCHING BONES jamming the motorcycle's gears. \nGUS (dead-pan) Whoops. \nHe bares his teeth in a death's head grin. \nON THE KNOLL \nDrew has witnessed the killing. He's mortified. \nBELOW - \nGus tosses the bloody motorcycle aside, slowly raising his eyes up to where Drew stands. His eyes meet Drew's. \nDrew hastily jerks his bike around and takes off. \nGus starts after him on foot. \nINT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DAY \nDrew rushes through the front door, SLAMMING it behind him and throwing the deadbolt. \nINT.  BEDROOM - DAY \nDrew climbs onto his bed and grabs his shotgun from the gun rack. His fingers shake as he flips off the safety. \nDREW Oh man... \nJust then we hear the CRACKLE of a POLICE P.A. and Gus' amplified VOICE coming from the yard outside. \nGUS (V.O.) (mocking) This is the Police, come out of the house with your hands up! \nGus finishes his words with a burst of FEEDBACK and then amplified MANIACAL LAUGHTER. \nDrew's eyes go wide with terror. He creeps out into the hall, clutching the gun. \nDrew grabs a chair and HEAVES it through the window... \nGUS (O.S.) ...OR ARE YOU JUST TOO FUCKING STUPID?! \nThe bedroom door EXPLODES INWARD and Gus claws his way into the room... \nWasting no time, Drew climbs through the broken window... \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DAY \nDrew slides down the slant of the roof. He hits the lattice and takes it to the ground with him. \nUntangling himself, he gets to his feet... \n...and here comes Amanda, ARRIVING HOME. \nDrew runs for her car, waving his hands, throwing himself into her path so she'll go no further. She SLAMS on the brakes. \nDrew pulls open the passenger door and dives inside... \nDREW Gus killed Clyde, Mom! He's trying to kill me! \nJust then, the BACK DOOR flies open. Gus steps out. \nGUS Drew, buddy! Daddy's not done yet! \nAmanda spots the hammer hanging from his grip. Gus cracks a sick smile and FLINGS THE HAMMER at the car... \nCRACK! The hammer bounces off the windshield, causing it to spiderweb. \nDREW Go Mom! Go!!! \nThat's all the convincing Amanda needs. She puts the car into reverse and stomps on the gas... \nINT.  CAR - DAY \nSpeeding down the highway. Drew and Amanda are mortified. \nSuddenly, we hear the WAIL of Gus' patrol car coming up from behind. Amanda looks to the rear-view mirror... \nEXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY \nApproaching from the road ahead is a POTATO TRUCK. \nINT.  AMANDA'S CAR - DAY \nAmanda hips her head back in front of them. The potato truck is blaring its HORN. \nGus' car swerves out onto the shoulder, speeding up to match her pace. \nDREW Mom!!! \nGus cranks the wheel, jumping back onto the road, forcing Amanda's car into the path of the oncoming truck. \nINT.  POTATO TRUCK - DAY \nTHE DRIVER stands on the BRAKES. \nEXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY \nTHE POTATO TRUCK COLLIDES WITH AMANDA'S CAR. HEAD ON. \nThousands of potatoes explode from the rear of the truck, obscuring our view. \nWE HEAR THE HORRIFYING SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING METAL. CRUNCHING BONES. AND SILENCED CRIES. \nGus' vehicle speeds past. WE HOLD on the mess of twisted steel. Clearly there are no survivors. \nINT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - DUSK \nGeoff enters first. Wearing a dark suit. Looking pale and empty inside. Chase follows, dressed in black. It's obvious they've been to a funeral. \nWithout a word, Geoff heads up the stairs. Chase watches on, feeling utterly helpless. \nINT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY \nChase exits from his bedroom, pulling a sweater over a more casual change of clothes. He cocks his head at the SOUNDS of Geoff moving about in the attic above. \nThe door atop the attic stairway is barely ajar. \nChase wrinkles his brow, concerned. Turning away, he heads downstairs. \nINT.  KITCHEN - DAY \nMarjorie is preparing dinner. Across the room, the kitchen TV is playing... \nON TELEVISION is the evening news. A photo of Drew and Amanda appears above the NEWSCASTER. \nNEWSCASTER ... Friends and neighbors came to pay respects for Drew and Amanda Gilbert, who died in a head-on collision Saturday... \nFrom out of the darkness... \nRENEE'S HAND \nENTERS FRAME, gently touching Geoff's side. And with its arrival, so comes her eerie LULLABY. \nRENEE (a whisper) I need you, Geoff... \nGEOFF \nslowly raises his head, bewildered. Renee's hand withdraws into the darkness. He reaches out for her, but she's gone. The LULLABY remains, beckoning from down the attic stairs. \nThe attic door slowly swings open of its own accord. \nGeoff rises from the bed and follows. \nINT.  DOWNSTAIRS FOYER - NIGHT \nGeoff looks into the living room as he passes. Marjorie has fallen asleep on the sofa with the TV on. \n155   OMITTED \nEXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT \nThe lullaby drifts from beyond the deadfall. The fog rolls inward, towards the distant burial ground. As Geoff moves towards the deadfall, the fog converges around him. \n157   OMITTED \nEXT.  THE BOG - NIGHT \nThe lure of Renee's lullaby pulls Geoff deeper into the woods. We hear the unearthly ANIMAL HOWL once more. \n159   OMITTED THRU 167   OMITTED \nEXT.  PLEASANTVILLE CEMETERY - NIGHT \nChase's van pulls to a stop behind a maintenance vehicle. \nChase is greeted by the limping CARETAKER, who quickly leads him off across the rolling hillside. \nCARETAKER ...sorry to disturb you, Doctor Matthews, but I thought you'd want to come have a look for yourself. It's the damndest thing... \nAT RENEE'S GRAVE - \nChase stops cold, gazing at the ground before him in disbelief... \nThe grave is a gaping cavity. The casket has been unearthed. Renee's body is missing. \nCHASE Jesus... (uncomprehending) Gus did this?! \nCARETAKER (nodding) He stuck around after the funeral. Told me he had an order to exhume your wife. I didn't think much of it until I saw him drag the body out of the coffin... (shakes his head) He put your wife in his truck and drove off right through Amanda and Drew's headstones... \nThe caretaker points across the hillside... \nTIRE TRACKS cut through the manicured grass, cutting a path of destruction right through the field of headstones and on through the fence. \nCARETAKER I swear, nothing this weird has happened since Louis Creed dug up his boy... (beat) You want me to notify the authorities? \nChase doesn't answer, he just storms past the caretaker. \nINT.  VAN - NIGHT \nThe van is speeding down the dark, open highway. Chase is on the car phone, frantic, waiting as it RINGS. There's finally an answer... \nCHASE Doctor Yolander, this is Chase Matthews, we spoke the other day... \nYolander cuts him off. \nYOLANDER'S VOICE (bitter) You didn't leave town, did you. \nINT.  YOLANDER'S HOUSE (INTERCUT) \nYolander sits in the darkness, a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler at his side. His \"creatures\" are all around him, eyes glowing with reflected moonlight. His voice is slurred. The voice of someone who's already damned. \nYOLANDER You sorry bastard. You stayed. I have nothing more to say to you, Matthews... \nCHASE'S VOICE (desperate) Look, just tell me one thing. Did I treat an animal that had been brought back to life? Did I?! \nYOLANDER What do you think? \nINT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT \nChase grips the carphone tightly, his knuckles white. \nYOLANDER (V.O.) Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead. \nCHASE My God... (mounting horror) ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife... \nYOLANDER'S VOICE (cutting him off) I'm retired from my practice, Matthews. It's your practice now, and it's your problem. (beat) God help you... \nChase's headlights stream through the windows, distorting the interior. The house looks like it's been through a tornado. A trail of BLOODY PAW PRINTS leads into the kitchen. The stench is repulsive. Grimacing, Chase has to keep himself from gagging. \nCHASE Jesus... \nAs Chase moves forward, he catches sight of... \nGUS \nstanding in a swath of light. At Gus' feet is Zowie, tongue lolling out of his mouth. Dead for the second time. Scattered around the dog are various tools. \nPropped against the wall is the cut out square of wood. It's fitted with hinges at the top. \nCHASE Gus, what are you doing?! \nGus glances down at the dead dog. \nGUS (dead-pan) I was building a doggy door. \nCHASE God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?! \nGus brings a cordless electric drill up from his side, pointing it at Chase in a threatening manner. \nGUS (grins) A little drilling. A little killing. \nAs Gus moves forward, Chase gets a good look at him for the first time. He doesn't look even remotely alive. \nCHASE Holy shit! \nChase levels his gun with a trembling hand. \nGus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on Chase's horror. \nChase pulls the trigger. A bullet pounds Gus' chest. A SPRAY OF FLESH explodes from his back. \nUnphased, Gus regains his balance. \nGUS God I hate when that happens... \nBefore Chase can squeeze off the next round, Gus rips the gun from his grip... \nGUS You got a permit for that? \nOpening the chamber, Gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses the gun aside. \nGUS Didn't think so. \nGus fires up the drill. The bit spinZZZZZZ. He DIVES at Chase, knocking him back against the counter. The drill bit SINKS INTO CHASE'S ARM... \nChase SCREAMS as Gus withdraws it. Now, he presses it into Chase's shoulder. Chase is on the verge of blacking out now. The pain is unbearable... \nGus withdraws the drill once again, aiming now for Chase's eye. \nGUS (maniacal) No brain, no pain, Chase. Think about it... \nThe whirling drill bit is millimeters away from Chase's eye. He clutches Gus' arm, trying to force the drill aside... \nAt the last second, adrenaline kicks in and Chase diverts the drill. It SINKS INTO the counter-top nearby... STUCK. \nGus ROARS, lashing out, but Chase manages to duck away... \nChase catches sight of HIS GUN on the floor. He scrambles for it, scooping it up... \nBULLETS are rolling across the floor every which way. Chase slaps his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber... \nGus' hands CLAMP DOWN around Chase's neck. He swings Chase around and SLAMS him against the wall, lifting him off his feet... \nChase GASPS as the life is literally crushed out of him... \nHe brings the gun up beneath Gus' chin and jams it into his ruined throat. Gus just keeps on throttling him... \nGUS (insane) Just remember, Chase... I had Renee first... and now I'm gonna have her last... \nBLAM! The top of Gus' head BLOWS off. His BODY is thrown back by the incredible force, tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a HEAVY THUD. \nChase sucks in precious air, then his head snaps up. \nCHASE Geoff! \nEXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nChase stumbles from the house. It's a wonder he's even conscious. He swings open the van door and throws himself inside, sinking the key into the ignition. \nINT.  ATTIC - NIGHT \nMarjorie is now seated before Renee's theatrical make-up mirror, entranced. She's wearing the beaded peach dress. \nWith the help of Renee's vast array of cosmetics, Marjorie has turned herself into a stunning beauty. \nThe lipstick isn't quite right. Turning to the countertop magnifying mirror, she carefully touches up her ruby red lips. Her face fills nearly the entire mirror... \nCHASE (shaking his head) No... \nRENEE Don't you love me anymore, Chase? \nCHASE You're not Renee... Renee's dead... (screaming) Geoff! Get over here now! \nBut Geoff just holds his mother tighter. A hint of annoyance flickers through Renee's eyes. She strokes Geoff's hair. \nRENEE (looking at Chase) Geoff, honey, why don't you go downstairs. Your father and I need a moment alone. Do it for me? \nGeoff looks up at his mother, mesmerized. She releases him from the embrace. He brushes past Chase without a glance and heads for the attic door. \nRENEE Geoff... \nGeoff pauses at the door, looking back. Renee's words have a hauntingly familiar ring... \nRENEE I love you. \nGeoff smiles. Turning away, he opens the door and... \nCLYDE \nis standing there, an AXE perched on his shoulder. His face is torn to shit, bones and brain matter exposed. He's covered from head to toe in dirt and clotted blood. He looks worse than any of the undead we've seen. A total walking nightmare. \nCLYDE (grinning) Hey, Junior. Wanna play? \nWHOOSH! Clyde swings the axe, sinking it into the wall just in front of Geoff's face... \nGeoff tumbles back onto the floor, snapping out of his trance. \nClyde brings the axe down... \n...and Geoff rolls to the side, barely avoiding decapitation. \nCHASE Geoff! \nChase stumbles forward to rescue his son. As he does so, Clyde brings the axe back up, SMASHING Chase in the head with the blunt end... \nChase goes down. Unconscious. \nCLYDE Oops! Looks like Daddy got a boo- boo... \nClyde turns his gaze back on Geoff. \nCLYDE Now, where were we? \nGeoff shuffles backwards across the floor as Clyde moves into the room. \nRenee passes behind Clyde. She SLAMS the attic door shut and snaps off the knob with a jerk of the wrist, locking them all inside. \nScared out of his wits, Geoff makes it to his feet. Clyde swings again and misses... \nGeoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys go down... \nRENEE \nMoves to the vanity. She sweeps a hand across it, sending everything crashing to the ground. Crystal perfume bottles SHATTER, spilling their contents over the floor. \nRenee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on. She touches the flame to the perfume-soaked floor... \nFLAMES roar into existence, racing across the floorboards, igniting the curtains... \nWe see the flames reflected in Renee's soulless eyes. \nON GEOFF AND CLYDE \nAs they wrestle with one another across the floor. Bloody spittle drips from Clyde's face. He flashes a feral snarl. \nClyde LUNGES forward and tears into Geoff's shoulder with his teeth... \nGeoff SCREAMS. His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a mirror shard. He JABS it up and into Clyde's eye... \nSomehow, Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde. He rises to his feet... \nClyde lets loose a DEMONIC ROAR. He charges, SLASHING the axe wildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike. Nothing's going to stop him. Nothing. \nFlames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the canopy drapings... devouring everything. SMOKE is rolling across the floor... \nGeoff reaches a far wall. He's trapped in a corner. There's nowhere else to go. Behind Geoff is a CIRCUIT BOX. INSULATED CABLES run from the box down through the attic floor. Geoff turns... \nAnd here comes Clyde... \nCLYDE Here it comes, buddy! HERE IT FUCKING COMES!!! \nClyde swings. Geoff ducks. The axe hits the circuit box behind him, severing the insulated cables... \nAs Clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try, Geoff reaches for one of the SPARKING CABLES. \nClyde raises the axe above his head... \n", "test1_input": "The woods here have grown long with shadows. The air is still and the sound of birds is conspicuously absent. \nA WOODEN ARCHWAY frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard. Scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a child's barely legible attempt at \"PET SEMATARY.\" \nGeoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude, crowded graves. Collars, leashes, bird cages and other accessories adorn the makeshift crosses and headstones. \nGeoff moves along the outer circle of markers, each crafted by a child's caring hands. \nAs he searches, he can't help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs. On the outer circle, he sees a crate-board marker memorializing: SMUCKY THE CAT... HE WAS OBEDIANT. \nMOVING INWARD, the markers are older. The ones he can still read convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death. \nHere is a wide, flat, upright board planted deep in the earth: \"In Memory of MARTA our Pet Rabit Dyed March 1 1965.\" \nThe next three rows are illegible, the inscriptions are weathered beyond recognition... And then, chiseled into sandstone: HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER LIVED 1929-1939. \nAnd now... \"MEOW.\" Faint. But very much alive. \nGeoff picks up his pace, weaving quickly toward the center. \nThere, he finds Tiger. Trapped in a rusted old birdcage, its base swallowed by the grave. \nGeoff opens the door and frees Tiger, stroking the trembling kitten. \nGeoff's eyes are drawn to the far perimeter... to the deadfall... \nTHE DEADFALL looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of skeletal remains. An abstract stairway to things beyond. A wind picks up just then, sending leaves skittering in waves across the ground. \n40    OMITTED \nEXT.  PET SEMATARY PATH - DAY \nWhen Geoff turns around, he finds Drew waiting for him under the archway. Drew smiles, full of respect for Geoff. \nDREW I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before. \nGEOFF (shrugs) He pissed me off. \nDREW (his smile fading) Sorry about your mom. (beat) I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus... \nHe grimaces at the thought. \nGEOFF My dad's not so bad. \nDrew glances around at all the makeshift grave markers. \nDREW I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead... \nGEOFF (serious) You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad. \nDREW Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad. \nGeoff nods knowingly. \nGEOFF What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life? \nDREW Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here... \nThey head off, full of childhood. \nINT.  KITCHEN - DUSK \nMarjorie is at the stove, fixing up dinner, while Chase scans the newspaper at the table. \nGeoff enters through the kitchen door. He moves past them without a word. \nCHASE (calling after him) Hey! How was your first day at school? \nGEOFF (over his shoulder) It sucked. \nMARJORIE Now is that any way to talk to your father? \nGeoff stops for a moment, turns... \nGEOFF You're not my mother. \n...and exits through the opposite door. \nChase looks to Marjorie and offers a sympathetic shrug. \nCHASE Sorry. \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DUSK \nCRUDE CAGES HOUSE DOZENS OF RABBITS. Situated alongside the garage. A sign above the cages reads: PET RABBITS - $10.00. Bells positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play. \nGus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage. \nFinishing it off, he hangs the plug next to an outside socket. Moving onto the next chore, he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into feeding slots for the hungry rabbits. \n", "test1_true": "One of the cages starts to vibrate. \nGus gives it a look: A PAIR OF RABBITS aren't interested in eating, they're joined in fast and furious passion. \nGus gets a chuckle out of the sight. \nGUS Way to go, Romeo... \nGus replaces the rabbit in the hutch. And before he goes, HE SINKS THE PLUG INTO THE SOCKET. An ELECTRICAL CHARGE dances along the base of the cage, a deterrent for intruders. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDrew's mother, AMANDA, withdraws a roast from the oven. \nGus is at the sink, washing his hands. He turns to see Zowie laying at Drew's feet in the living room. Drew is watching a MUSIC VIDEO on TV. \nGUS Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner. \nDREW Just until he heals up? \nGus is waggling his thumb toward the back door. \nDrew slumps in defeat. \nGus reaches into the cabinet and pours himself a Bourbon. \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nDrew walks Zowie from the house with a dish of dog food. As they pass the rabbit dens, Zowie alters his path. Drew gets a handful of his collar and pulls him back. \nAcross the yard is an enclosed dog run. Twenty feet long by ten feet wide. Drew puts Zowie inside with the dog food. \nDrew strokes Zowie's mane affectionately, then backs away, closing the wood-framed door to the dog run. \nINT.  DREW'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nAmanda's about to put the roast on the table when Gus nuzzles up behind her, breathing down her backside. With his drink in hand, he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of the neck. \nGus eases his free hand around between Amanda and the counter and presses his palm firmly into her crotch, drawing her body tight to him. \nShe stiffens at his intimate hold, uncomfortable with his timing. \nAMANDA Gus, please... \nAt the back door, Drew is watching from beyond the screen, disgusted by the sight of Gus pawing his mother. Drew swings the door open as loud as he can to signal his return. \nGus plants a last kiss on the back of Amanda's neck and backs off. But before he goes, he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving platter. Leveling his leering eyes at Amanda, he stuffs it into his mouth suggestively. \nGUS God damn, you're good. \nDrew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table, returning his attention to the TV, where another MUSIC VIDEO is on. \nGus glances at the TV, annoyed by the MUSIC. He drops into his spot at the head of the table, blocking Drew's view. Drew leans to the side for a better look. Gus takes notice and leans to the same side to obstruct his view. \nGUS You're breaking the law here, Drew. \nAMANDA Really, Gus. It won't bother me. \nGus ignores her, inching forward with a confidential, harsh whisper. \nGUS Your mom's spent the last hour cooking. Stop being a little jerk and show her some appreciation. \nDrew aims the remote control at Gus, as if to shut him up, and silences the TV. \nAmanda approaches with the roast. The moment it's on the table, Drew starts dishing up a hefty serving. Gus spears Drew's fork with the serving fork. \nGUS Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass. \nDREW Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are. \nAMANDA Knock it off, guys... \nGus throws back a sip of Bourbon. \nGUS (to Drew, quietly) You watch that mouth of yours, Drew buddy. \n46    OMITTED \nEXT.  ZOWIE'S DOG RUN - NIGHT \nMOVING THROUGH Zowie's enclosed pen, WE SEE no sign of the dog. REACHING the door, WE FIND that the wood around the bottom hinge has been chewed through. The base of the door is ajar, just enough for a dog to have slipped through. \nEXT.  RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT \nIn the still of the night, Gus' rabbit pens sit unattended. And then WE HEAR the tinkling of dog tags. Snoozing rabbits awaken as Zowie lumbers INTO FRAME. \nZowie rises on his hind legs, pressing his paws to a cage. Blue sparks fly as Zowie is jolted with the electrical charge. \n", "test1_id": 291, "test2_input": "Chase hesitates, but finally he rises and answers the phone. \nAfter a moment, he returns. GEOFF Who was that? \nCHASE Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him. \nGeoff's eyes widen. He looks like a ghost walked over his grave. \nGEOFF I'm going with you. \nChase nods and exits to get his coat. \nGeoff looks back at the TV once more. The image paused. \nRenee staring at us from beyond the grave. \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nGus, Amanda, Drew and Geoff are gathered around Chase's van. \nEXT./INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT \nChase lays Zowie on his side on an examining table and shines an overhead light onto the wound. \nGeoff is looking in from outside, utterly bewildered by the living, breathing dog. \nCHASE How'd it happen? \nGus casts a threatening glance in Drew's direction. \nDREW (glaring at Gus) Some psycho hunter probably got trigger happy... \nChase is too busy preparing a syringe to notice the nonverbal exchange. \nCHASE I'm going to give Zowie a local anaesthetic so I can clean up the wound. I'd like to take him home tonight for observation. \nAMANDA Fine. \nDREW Can you keep him at your place until he gets better? \nCHASE Sure... \nDrew tenderly strokes Zowie's mane as Chase administers the injection. Zowie stares up at Geoff with dull, blank eyes. \nDrew reads Geoff's bewilderment and joins him outside the van. Their words are clear, but whispered. \nGEOFF Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him. \nDREW He was dead. You know he was. \nGeoff returns his stare to Zowie. \nDREW You can't tell anyone, Geoff. Ever. \nGeoff looks into Drew's eyes and nods in understanding. \n69    OMITTED THRU 75    OMITTED \nINT.  GEOFF'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTiger is curled up at the foot of Geoff's bed. Geoff climbs in, careful not to disturb the kitten. As he lays his head back on the pillow... \nVOICE (O.S.) Sleep tight, darling. I'll be with you soon. \nIt's a woman's VOICE. A familiar one. Now we hear the rhythmic CREAK of a rocking chair. And with it comes the voice again, humming a HAUNTING LULLABY. \nWide-eyed, Geoff turns his head toward the source... \nA WOMAN'S NONDESCRIPT FORM is seated in the rocking chair across the room. Rocking forward, her face passes into a swath of moonlight... \nIt's Renee. With the rock of the chair, her face recedes back into the shadows. Her soothing HUM remains. \nAnd again, her face passes into the swath of light. And again it retreats. \nGeoff raises his hand, reaching out for her. \nRenee's hand rises from the shadows, reaching for him. \nBut suddenly, THE ROOM BEGINS TO STRETCH. \nThe rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes, mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their control. \nLIGHTNING FLASHES in the bedside window. Renee is falling farther and farther away. \nGEOFF Mom!!! \nGeoff leaps from his bed as the darkness closes in and... \nGEOFF \n", "test2_true": "...the steady CREAK of the rocking chair. \nGeoff slowly turns his head once again, repeating the actions of his dreams. \nIn the shadows, the chair is still rocking. As it comes forward into the moonlight, we see ZOWIE, curled up asleep on the seat of the chair. \nTiger is not on the bed anymore. She's up on top of the bookcase now, wide awake, eyes fixed on the dog. She HISSES. \nGeoff stares at the rocking chair, petrified. \nINT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY \nChase strips off the bandage over Zowie's rear end. The wound is gooey and open. \nGeoff reads the concern in Chase's expression. Drew is right there at Geoff's side, looking on. \nDREW What's the deal? \nCHASE I don't know. He's had three days. His immune system should've responded by now... \nChase puts on his stethoscope and checks under the dog's rib-cage for a pulse. He checks a number of places, then shakes his head, totally confused. \nCHASE I can't seem to find a pulse... it must be so weak, it's not registering... \nGeoff and Drew share conspiratorial glances as Chase sets the stethoscope aside and extracts a blood sample. \nChase labels the capped vial of blood \"ZOWIE\" and carefully places it into a packing container. When he closes the lid, we see the preaddressed label: \nUNIVERSITY OF MAINE School of Veterinary Medicine Lab Samples Enclosed \nUncomfortable with Chase's investigation, Geoff reaches for Zowie. \nGEOFF We'll take him back to the kennels, Dad. \n78A   OMITTED \nINT.  BOARDING AREA - DUSK \nTHE KITTENS ARE HISSING, shrinking to the back of their kennel. \nZowie stands motionless before their cage, gazing in at them. \nGeoff and Drew are nearby, putting the finishing touches on the bedding inside a larger boarding kennel. \nGEOFF You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better? \nDREW You think he'd believe it if he did? \nOne of the kittens SPATS fearfully at Zowie. Geoff turns to stare at Zowie. \nGEOFF How can he not have a heartbeat? \nDREW (worried) Maybe it takes a while... \nDrew lifts Zowie into the kennel. Geoff secures the door, something that clearly must be done from the outside. \nZowie immediately begins to pace back and forth inside the cage. He turns towards us and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TOWN, CHASE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nA SNARLING WEREWOLF rushing at us. \nChase jumps back, frightened out of his wits and we realize... \nThe werewolf is part of a group of COSTUMED KIDS out trick-or- treating. The kids LAUGH at Chase's reaction and hurry on, dragging their candy loot bags behind them. \nChase sighs and turns to lock the office door. He's closing up for the night. \nHe climbs into his Mobile Vet Van. We HOLD ON the new sign in the back window: \"A HALLOWEEN TREAT. FREE KITTENS.\" Beneath that is a pencil-sketch of a black arched-back kitten. \nINT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMarjorie and Geoff are at the kitchen table with the remnants of dinner. Geoff is doing last-minute touches on his costume. \nMarjorie looks over his costume. He's got a hockey mask pushed back onto the top of his head. \nMARJORIE So who're you going as, Wayne Gretzky? \nFor effect, Geoff slips the hockey mask down over his face before answering. \nGEOFF I'm going as Jason. \nMARJORIE Jason? Who's he play for? \nGEOFF He doesn't. He hacks people up. \n", "test2_id": 292, "test3_input": "Geoff checks his watch. \nGEOFF I'm late. \nAs Geoff heads for the door, Chase is just coming in for the evening. \nCHASE Hey! Where're you off to? \nGEOFF I'm going out, Dad! \nGeoff ducks out the door. Chase turns to Marjorie. \nCHASE Out? \nMARJORIE He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years. \nCHASE What do they do up there? \nMARJORIE Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things... (she shrugs) It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young. \nINT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nDrew is at the bathroom mirror. \nAMANDA Hold still. Hold still. \nAmanda puts the finishing touches of color on Drew's lips. She's done an alarmingly good job of turning Drew into THE JOKER. \nAMANDA You make sure you're home by ten. If Gus finds out I let you go... \nDREW (sighs) I'll be home, Mom. Don't worry. I won't let Gus blow up again... \nAmanda looks Drew straight in the eyes. \nAMANDA Drew, I know Gus isn't your father, but you never even knew your real father. He walked out on the both of us, and you remember that. (beat) Gus isn't that way. He has it in him to love us both. You just have to give him a chance... \nDrew nods respectfully. Amanda gives him a kiss. Drawing back, she rubs out the lipmarks she's left on his made-up cheek. \n83    OMITTED \nEXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT \nDark clouds paint the foreboding sky. A broken pulse of lightning streaks through the dense haze. \nAbandoning their bikes next to the path, Drew and Geoff approach the archway. The graveyard beyond is deathly silent. \nThey pass beneath the archway, entering the clearing. \nAnd now, a soft, chilling VOICE drifts over the graves. \nVOICE (O.S.) Geoff, honey. Mommy's here... \nGeoff freezes in his tracks, awestruck as... \nA WOMAN'S BODY \nswoops down from the darkness above, materializing out of nowhere. A fluttering negligee. Flowing blonde hair. \nRENEE'S FACE appears out of the shadows, masked with sadness. \nGeoff swallows the lump in his throat. \nRenee's form keeps coming. But even as she approaches, her visage grows less distinguishable. Just a phantom countenance now. A shadow framed by golden hair, resting atop a veiled body... \nShe's coming so fast that she's upon Geoff in no time. He fumbles back, startled out of his wits... \nTHE BODY is upon him now, flailing wildly. Geoff thrashes and struggles, screaming bloody murder. \nGradually, he realizes the body isn't fighting back. Geoff eases his struggle, lets his scream fall off. \nNow he hears wild, mischievous LAUGHTER. \nDrew pulls the body away. It's just a heavy wad of stuffed clothing: A DUMMY dressed in a negligee, capped by a blonde wig. It dangles near the end of a slanted wire. \nClyde, Stevie, Brad, and a half dozen other costumed KIDS appear from the nearby cover of bushes, doubled over in laughter. \nClyde tugs at a piece of twine that's connected to the back of the dummy's head and makes spooky sounds. The dummy jumps around on the slanted wire. \nClyde drops the dummy and saunters forward. \nCLYDE Look at this, Junior here practically shit his pants. \nClyde drops down, nose to nose with Geoff, who's still recovering. \nCLYDE Maybe you're too chicken to hang out with the rest of the boys. You gonna run home to Daddy now? \nGeoff brushes himself off and rises to his feet. He stares into Clyde's eyes. \nGEOFF Fuck off. \n", "test3_true": "Drew follows, then the rest of the boys, leaving Clyde staring after them, standing alone with the dummy. \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nGus' squad car slows to a stop outside. Gus swings open the door and ambles toward the porch. \nINT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAmanda draws back from the window, mortified. She nervously crosses to the refrigerator and grabs a beer, turning as Gus enters. \nAMANDA You're home early. \nGUS Nope. Just ran out of smokes. \nGus opens a kitchen drawer and fishes for a pack of cigarettes. He fires one up. \nGUS Where's the boy? \nAmanda squirms. \nAMANDA Uh... in his room... \nGus tightens his brow, casting a suspicious eye. \nA sickened look flushes through Amanda as Gus pulls his eyes away from her and marches upstairs. \nGUS (O.S.) DREW! \nHis feet POUND down the hallway. Silence for an instant. Then the powerful swing of Drew's door. Followed by Gus' hastened return down the hallway. And as he hustles down the stairs... \nGUS God damn it, Amanda! You want me to be a father to the boy, and as soon as I lay down the law, you let him break it! \nGus stops before Amanda. \nGUS Where is he? \nOne step away from terror, Amanda shakes her head. Gus loses his patience. He rips the can of beer from her grip and sends it flying across the room. \nGUS WHERE IS YOUR SON!? \nAmanda sighs in quiet defeat. \nAMANDA The Pet Sematary. \nGus turns away and heads out the door. \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWheels spin as Gus' squad car streaks off into the night. The cherry top glows to life, bombarding the countryside. \nEXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT \nBy now, nearly TWO DOZEN COSTUMED KIDS have gathered at the Pet Sematary. In the midst of the graves, a small story-telling campfire burns. A number of the boys sip beer, trying to pretend that the bitter after-taste doesn't bother them. \nClyde sits up front. At fourteen, he's the elder statesmen of the group. With a beer in one hand, and a cigarette in the other, Clyde is just finishing up a spooky yarn. \nCLYDE ...yeah, that old Louis was one sick fuck... digging up little Gage like so, maggots pouring out of that kid's eyes... \nClyde whistles. He drags on his cigarette and puffs out a smoke ring. Sees he still has an audience. \nCLYDE Ellie was the only Creed that lived. Then one night a few months later, Ellie freaks out, and she hacks up her grandparents with an axe! (beat) Police found her licking their brains off the blade... They locked her up in a psycho ward and all she said were two words: 'Pet Sematary. Pet Sematary.' \nClyde stares at the wide-eyed kids. He grins, takes a swig of beer, and moves in for the kicker. \nCLYDE Oh yeah! Almost forgot! Here's the best part. Two nights ago she escapes. Word is, she was heading for Maine. Man I hope she doesn't show up out here. (feigning concern) Shit, we wouldn't even notice her, not if she's wearing a costume. She could be one of us... \nClyde casts a suspicious eye on the group. The kids uneasily look at each other, making sure they know who's behind each and every costume. \nSuddenly Clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror. \nCLYDE Oh my Goddd!!! \nClyde lifts a trembling finger, pointing beyond the group of spellbound listeners. \nCLYDE It's... It's... \nThe kids are afraid to turn around, assuming Clyde's rigged up some unspeakable terror... \nAnd for an instant, a look of real horror washes over Clyde's face... \nA FIGURE \nIs coming up the path beneath the archway, rising out of the swirling mist. A frightening silhouette, backlit by the moon. \nBut then Clyde realizes who it is. \nCLYDE Shit! It's Drew's Dad. It's fuckin' Gus! \n", "test3_id": 293}

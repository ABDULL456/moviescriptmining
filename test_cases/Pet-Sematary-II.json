{"test1_input": "Tiger scampers by as Chase coughs his way out of the cloud of dust. \nINT.  WAITING AREA \nTiger sees the front door ajar. And as she approaches to explore what lies beyond-- \nThe door swings open... \nZOWIE, A SIBERIAN HUSKY is staring back at her. He's black and white with blue eyes, with a mask that is at once menacing and majestic. \nA pudgy thirteen year old boy, DREW, has a hold of the dog's collar. \nZowie's BARK sends Tiger scrambling. \nDrew loses his grip as Zowie yanks free. A strong, paternal command calls after Drew from outside. \nVOICE (O.S.) Drew, you get a handle on that dog, now! \nINT.  EXAMINATION ROOM \nChase spins around at the commotion as Tiger darts across the floor with the barking dog in pursuit. \nMayhem ensues as Zowie's big paws slip on the slick tile. \nGeoff rushes in from the boarding area. \nTiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney. \nZowie's snoot wedges beneath the base, inches from Tiger's tiny, striking paw. \nDrew slides in on his knees, renewing his hold on Zowie's collar. He pulls the dog back. \nGeoff rescues Tiger from beneath the gurney. \nDrew shrugs sheepishly. \nDREW Sorry. He gets kinda hyper... \nDrew's stepfather, Gus Gilbert, enters. The dreaded, domineering voice of authority in Drew's life. WE know him as the sheriff at Renee's funeral. \nGUS Hell, he thought it was lunch. How ya doin', Chase? (a handshake) You haven't met my boy. (aside) Drew, where the hell are your manners. \nDrew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to Chase. Then Geoff. The boys shake. \nGEOFF He's a cool lookin' dog. \nZowie lurches forward, eager to shower affection on Geoff. Geoff strokes the dog's soft mane. \nGEOFF What's his name? \nDREW Zowie. \nDrew puts his palm under Zowie's chin and turns him for Chase to see. There are several scabbed-over gashes on his left cheek. \nGUS Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot. \nDREW Is he gonna be okay? \nWith one eye on Zowie, Chase sprays some antiseptic on the examination table and wipes it clean. \nCHASE Let's have him hop up here. \nDrew prods Zowie. Zowie jumps up onto the table. Chase looks over the facial lacerations, then turns on a penlight and examines the dog's eyes. \nGus passes a lingering look over Tiger. He reaches in to pet her, making sure it meets with Geoff's approval. \nGUS When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys. \nCHASE There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes. \nDrew perks up at the thought, but Gus shoots it down. \nGUS Not our home. \nChase takes the light out of Zowie's eyes. He looks to Gus. \nCHASE Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream-- \nGUS --Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this? \nChase turns to Drew and continues... \nCHASE His left eye is scratched, corneal abrasion. Eyedrops will help, but it's going to take som time. Try to keep him away from those rabbits, huh? \nDrew nods, casting a glance aside at Gus. \nGUS (to Chase) I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now. \nCHASE How'd you know that? \n", "test1_true": "GUS It's a small town, Chase. \nGus laughs and claps Chase on the shoulder. \nGUS Hey Geoff, did you know your mother and I used to be high- school sweethearts? \nGeoff is surprised at this. Surprised and annoyed. Tact isn't a quality that Gus possesses in abundance. \nGEOFF Really? \nGUS (nodding) Homecoming. Prom. Whole nine yards. (to Chase) Course that was a lifetime ago. \nEXT.  SCHOOL - DAY \nJUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS are converging en masse for classes. Chase's van pulls up front. \nINT.  VAN - DAY \nChase digs some cash out of his wallet. Geoff stares out at the school. He's dreading this. \nCHASE What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten? \nGEOFF (unenthused) Sure. \nChase looks at his son. \nCHASE You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you... \nGEOFF (cutting him off) I'll be fine, Dad. \nGeoff reaches for the door, but Chase stops him. He's trying to reach his son. He really is. \nCHASE (awkward) Geoff... you have to help me out here a little... \n\"MEOW!\" Chase drops his eyes to the bulge squirming around in Geoff's jacket. He can't help but smile. \nCHASE Are you sure you don't want me to pick you up. It's a long ride. \nGeoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his MOUNTAIN BIKE. \nGEOFF That's what my bike's for... \nBefore Chase can say another word, Geoff is gone. \nEXT.  VAN - DAY \nAs Chase pulls away, WE SEE the handmade sign taped in the back window: \nPRICELESS KITTENS FREE TO A GOOD HOME \nEXT.  SCHOOL - DAY \nDrew is among a small circle of BOYS. He recognizes Geoff walking his bike from the van. The largest of the boys, CLYDE, takes notice of the unfamiliar face. \nClyde is fifteen, going on twenty. You know the type: local bully, held back a year or two. \nCLYDE Check it out. That's the new kid. The son of that movie star. \nMischief gleams in Clyde's eyes as he watches Geoff's every move. The other boys follow suit. Clyde always takes the lead. \nGeoff fields their penetrating stares. For a second his eyes connect with Clyde's, then he moves on into the building. \nAmong the boys, Drew is the reluctant participant. \nINT.  CLASSROOM - DAY \nMRS. GORDON is addressing a room of SEVENTH GRADERS. \nGeoff is doodling in his notebook, feeling acutely out of place as he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new classmates are giving him. \nMRS. GORDON People, this is Geoff Matthews. He'll be joining our class for the rest of the school year... \nAs Mrs. Gordon points to him, Geoff drops his face even lower. This is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer. He'd like to throttle Mrs. Gordon. \nA freckle-faced boy, DOUG, fires off a question. \nDOUG Hey, what's Hollywood like? Do you know Eddie Murphy? \nGEOFF (annoyed) No. \nMRS. GORDON Why don't we save that for later, Doug? \nA girl with braces, SUSAN, continues the interrogation. \nSUSAN What about Julia Roberts? \nMRS. GORDON Susan! That'll be enough. \n", "test1_id": 291, "test2_input": "Drew and the others quickly turn around, realizing it's not part of the punch-line scare. \n89    OMITTED THRU 91    OMITTED \nEXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT \nThe kids quickly scramble for hiding places in the bordering brush, dropping their beer cans as fast as they can. \nAs Drew leaps to his feet, he upsets the fire, knocking one of the logs. A FLAMING EMBER rolls to the base of one of the brittle old crosses. \nDrew and Geoff run for it. \nEXT.  PATH, ARCHWAY - NIGHT \nGus moves quickly up the meandering path, sending the blinding beam of his flashlight over the graves. \nGUS You boys better not be drinking! \nEXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT \nThrough the thick woods, Drew is flanked by Geoff and Clyde. \nDREW Oh man, he's gonna kick my ass... \nDrew starts to take off. Clyde trips him on his first stride. Drew hits the dirt. \nCLYDE Thanks for fucking up our Halloween, dumbshit! \nClyde recedes into the woods as Gus approaches the campfire. He scans the area with his flashlight, illuminating the various beer cans. \nGUS Drew, you get your ass out here! Front and center! \nGeoff pulls Drew to his feet. \nGus passes the flashlight over the woods. Kids duck away, retreating from their hiding places... \nThe flashlight sweeps toward Drew. \nDrew freezes, spotlighted by Gus' beam. A burst of LIGHTNING floods Drew's horrified face. \nGUS Get out here, Joker. \nGeoff remains frozen in the woods nearby, out of Gus' light. \nBehind Gus, the wooden cross is completely on fire now. \nGUS You out here making a fool of me? \nDrew shakes his head in instant denial. \nGUS I'm warning you, buddy! You don't play by the rules, I'm gonna shadow your ass for eternity! \nDrew makes a break from his spot in the woods. He weaves through the markers, arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid Gus... \n...but Gus is quicker. He zigzags through the crosses and headstones to intercept Drew. \nGus gets a handful of Drew's collar and yanks him in. \nGUS You little shit! \nGus draws his free arm back and smacks Drew across the face. Drew goes down. \nGEOFF \nis looking on from the woods, horrified. Torn... \nDREW \ncowers on the ground, trying to scramble away. \nGeoff bolts out into the firelight, staring defiantly at Gus in silent accusation. \nGus is beyond furious. LIGHTNING flashes again. \nGUS You get out of here, Geoff Matthews! This is between me and my boy! \nGeoff doesn't move. Gus starts to advance forward... \n...but the GROWL emanating from the woods gives him pause. Everyone turns... \nA RUSTLING is heard in the bushes, and Zowie emerges into the building firelight, flashing his fangs at Gus. His eyes GLOW RED. \nGus freezes, studying Zowie. \nZowie inches forward, poised for the attack. \nGUS Call off your dog, Drew. \nDrew shifts his eyes from Zowie to Gus, too terrified to heed such a command. \n", "test2_true": "Gus' eyes shift to burning cross at his side. With a swift boot, he kicks over the cross and presses it into his grip. \nSwinging the cross like a primitive weapon, Gus connects with the side of Zowie's head. \nZowie spins a full circle from the impact. But he lands on all fours. Unphased. Taking the next step toward Gus. There's something clearly not of this world in Zowie's vicious stare. \nGUS (terrified) Drew, call him off! \nAll Drew can manage is a faint appeal. \nDREW Zowie... \nZowie goes for Gus, launching into the air... \nGUS DREW! \n...and sinking his glistening fangs into Gus' neck. \nAN ERUPTION OF BLOOD showers the closest headstone. \nGus comes helplessly tumbling down with the weight of the dog. His SCREAMS are suddenly cut short as Zowie rips out his throat. His arms flail weakly at his sides, then grow still. \nDrew and Geoff stare at the scene, wide-eyed with shock. \nZowie looks up from Gus' neck with dripping, red fangs. For a moment, his eyes settle on Drew. Then Zowie bolts off, disappearing into the night. \nDREW Oh, God. Oh, God... \nDrew's eyes shift to Geoff, whose face is flushed with sickened fear. \nGEOFF (a whisper) Is he dead? \nIn dazed shock, Drew moves in for a closer look at the body. \nGus' eyes are wide open. Blood is still pumping in rhythm from his jugular with each weakening beat of his heart. It's a gruesome image against the roaring fire. \nDrew kneels at Gus' side. He wants to touch him. To shake him awake, but with every attempt, he draws his hand back. \nGEOFF Is he breathing? Can you hear him breathing? \nDrew leans forward, turning his ear toward Gus' gaping mouth. And as he inches closer... \nGUS' FINGERS TWITCH \nHis hand jerks up and closes around Drew's neck. Gus stares up at him with his crazed menace. \nDrew SCREAMS. His fingers claw at Gus' hand, desperate to pry it loose... \n...but then, Gus' hand relaxes as his last, dying ounce of strength fades away. \nDrew shrinks back, crouching over the lifeless body as the blazing firelight dances over it. He turns his tear-filled gaze to Geoff. \nDREW Oh man, Geoff... we killed him... we killed him... (beat) What're we gonna do? \nGeoff draws closer and looks down into the dead man's face. \nGEOFF We could bring him back. \nDrew's eyes widen at the suggestion. \nAnd now, GAZING DOWN on Gus' body, and on the boys, WE PULL UP INTO A SLOW SPIRAL... \nWe move ever higher, until we are LOOKING DOWN UPON THE ENTIRE PET SEMATARY. At the SOUND of a shovel cutting into rocky soil, we... \nCUT TO: \n95    OMITTED \nEXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - NIGHT \nThree quick shots: \nA SHOVEL sinking into the earth. \nGUS falling head down into the grave, landing with a heavy THUD. \nSOIL covering Gus' lifeless face. \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAmanda is pacing back and forth on the porch, checking her watch every few steps. She sighs with relief as... \nDrew appears from the darkness of the woods. \nDrew dismounts his bike and carries it up the front porch steps, strangely silent. His clothes and face are caked with dirt. \nAMANDA Jesus, Drew, do you know what time it is? Did Gus ever find you? \n", "test2_id": 292, "test3_input": "Drew moves on past her into the house. \nAMANDA (calling after him) Drew? Drew, what happened? \nDREW (trying not to lose it) Nothing happened, Mom. We just ditched Gus, that's all... \nDrew pauses and stares out into the unknown darkness of the night. \nINT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nChase is in the study, perusing some files. He looks into the hallway as Geoff arrives home, then glances at the clock. It's late. Very late. \nChase rises. He's both angry and relieved. Right now, though, the anger's winning out. \nCHASE Were you drinking? \nGeoff absently shakes his head. He slumps back against the wall, drained from the night's horrors. \nCHASE Drew's Mom called hours ago, the rest of the kids were back by ten. Where the hell were you boys? \nGeoff shrugs, trying to mask his uneasiness. \nGEOFF Just out. \nCHASE \"Out.\" Well that's great, Geoff. (beat) Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again... \nGEOFF (cutting him off) I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep? \nChase stops and looks at his son. Geoff's exhaustion is self- evident. \nCHASE (sighing) Go on... we'll talk about this in the morning. \nGeoff nods and heads for the stairs. \nINT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT \nTHE CLOCK is creeping up on 2AM... \nTHUNDER rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter the window panes. \nGeoff's eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to sleep. Tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest. Slowly, we move back towards the window... \nIn a flash of LIGHTNING-- \nGUS' FACE \nAPPEARS OUTSIDE. Washed in the haunting white glow. Streaked with mud. Caked with blood. Staring in at Geoff. \nGeoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of THUNDER and whips his gaze to the window. Before he can focus... \n...the pulse of lightning fades away. And with it, Gus' face. Only darkness remains beyond the window pane. \nGeoff returns his gaze to the bedroom, unaware of Gus' appearance. He sinks back to his pillow, already hurtling towards sleep once more. \nEXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMOVING IN ON the house, WE SINGLE OUT a rain-obscured window on the ground floor, the window to Drew's bedroom. \nINT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT \nDrew is sound asleep, curled up under the sheets. He clutches his pillow like a life preserver. \nGUS (O.S.) Drew! \nDrew's eyes flutter open. He turns towards the window. Now, he hears some activity outside. And then Gus' hushed voice. \nGUS (O.S.) Drew, buddy. I lost my keys. \nDrew goes saucer-eyed. He swallows the swelling lump in his throat and rises from his bed. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDrew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key into the deadbolt on the back door. Drawing the CREAKING door open, he gazes out back. \nDREW (scared shitless) Gus? \nNothing moves outside. The longer Drew watches, the more eerie each shadow becomes. Spooked, Drew steps back inside, quickly closing the door. He locks it back up again. \nWhen he turns around, he's face to face with GUS. \nDrew stiffens, backing into the wall. \nDREW H-how'd you get in? \nGus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand, dangling his keys. \nGUS Found 'em. \nDrew's eyes follow a flow of blood from Gus' neck to the floor. Gus looks down at his dirty, bloody footprints. He's tracked blood all over the linoleum. \n", "test3_true": "Gus turns without another word and heads for the stairs. \nDrew's mouth drops in utter astonishment as he watches Gus clumsily climbing the stairs. \nAfter a moment, he returns his attention to the bloody kitchen floor. Tearing off a wad of paper towels, he wets them and begins to mop up Gus' tracks. \n103   OMITTED \nAT THE MIRROR - NIGHT \nGazing vacantly at his reflection, Gus covers his ravaged throat with a gauze strip, wrapping it around the circumference of his neck again and again and again. \nBehind him, the shower is running, filling up the bathroom with steam. \nFinishing the dressing off with a sloppy tape job, Gus reaches for the pajamas hanging nearby. He lazily buttons the buttons, failing to notice their alignment is off. He never did bother to shower. He's still covered with mud. \nINT.  AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGus enters from the steamy bathroom. The shower is still running. \nAmanda stirs, sleepy eyes focusing on him. \nAMANDA Gus, hon. I'm sorry about tonight. You coming to bed? \nGus lifts the covers and climbs in. With him comes the chill of death. Gus presses up behind her. His hand moves beneath the sheets, finding its way over the curve of her waist, caressing. Amanda shivers. \nAMANDA God, you're ice cold... (turning) ...and you smell! Lord, what did you get yourself into? \nIt's then that Amanda sees the bandage around Gus' neck. Blood is seeping through the gauze. \nAMANDA My God, Gus, what happened? \nAmanda reaches out to touch him, but Gus stops her hand short of the bandage. Instead, he leans forward and clutches one of her breasts. \nAmanda tries to twist away. \nAMANDA Gus... stop it! What's wrong with you?! \nBut Gus doesn't stop. He throws himself on top of Amanda, roughly forcing her back onto the bed. \nAMANDA Gus!!! \nAmanda's hands beat at Gus' face and back, to no apparent effect. With one arm forced against Amanda's throat, he rips open her nightgown with the other. \nWe pull away from Amanda's struggles, back to the bathroom. The shower running on and on, cloaking the bedroom in steam. \nEXT.  ROAD - DAY \nGeoff is riding along the highway, his backpack full of school books. Drew is waiting on the shoulder ahead. When Geoff approaches, Drew hops on his bike, getting up to speed. \nWITH THE BOYS - RIDING \nGeoff keeps glancing at Drew, waiting for him to say something. Drew maintains his enigmatic expression. \nGEOFF Well? \nDrew nods. Geoff's eyes widen in disbelief. \nDREW Picture this... Gus comes down to breakfast and he doesn't say a word. He even kind of smiles, like he forgot he hates me. And then you know what he does? He serves me an extra helping of pancakes... (beat) I asked him if I was still grounded... \"no.\" I asked him if you could spend the night, and he nods. It's like we're a family. A real family. \nThe words have their own meaning for Geoff, who stares to the road ahead in deep thought. \nDREW It's weird... \nGEOFF What do you mean? \nDREW It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie... \nThey share a chuckle that ends in silent uneasiness. \nINT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY \nChase enters with a stack of files tucked under his arm. As he organizes them in the large filing cabinet with the others, he listens to his messages on the answering machine. \nThe current caller sounds a little annoyed... \nMESSAGE MACHINE ...Doctor Matthews, this is Elliot Rudman at the university. I've looked over the blood specimen you sent us on canine Zowie... \nChase abandons the filing and immediately returns the call. While it RINGS... \nVOICE (O.S.) Knock, Knock, Doc. \nA MOTHER and TWO TODDLERS are standing in the doorway to Chase's office, trying not to intrude on his call. \nMOTHER (quiet whisper) We saw your sign. Are there any kitties left? \nChase studies them. They look like decent people. \n", "test3_id": 293}

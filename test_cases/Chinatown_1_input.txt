GITTES Only when I breathe. 
YELBURTON (laughing) Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray? 
GITTES I never was. 
YELBURTON (stops smiling) I don't understand. 
GITTES Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me. 
YELBURTON Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense. 
GITTES Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned. 
YELBURTON Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
GITTES Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news. 
Gittes heads toward the door. 
YELBURTON Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff. 
GITTES Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards? 
YELBURTON I said, the northwest valley. 
GITTES That's like saying they're in Arizona. 
YELBURTON Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location... 
Gittes nods. 
GITTES You're a married man, am I right? 
YELBURTON Yes... 
GITTES Hard working, have a wife and kids... 
YELBURTON Yes... 
GITTES I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over. (hands him a card) Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years. 
Gittes smiles, leaves an unsmiling Yelburton. 
INT. GITTES OFFICE 
Gittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie tries to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his office. 
EVELYN MULWRAY 
Is sitting, smoking. She looks up when he enters. 
EVELYN What's your usual salary? 
Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her. 
GITTES Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty for each of my operators, plus expenses, plus my fee if I show results. 
He's sitting now. Evelyn is very pale now, obviously very shaken. 
EVELYN Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble? 
GITTES Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know. 
EVELYN I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved. 
Gittes buzzes Sophie. 
GITTES Sophie, draw up one of our standard forms for Mrs. Mulwray. (he leans back; to Evelyn) Tell me, did you get married before or after Mulwray and your father sold the water department? 
Evelyn nearly jumps at the question. 
GITTES (continuing) Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he? 
EVELYN Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that. 
GITTES So you married your father's business partner? 
Evelyn nods. She lights another cigarette. 
GITTES (continuing; staring at her, points to the ashtray) You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray. 
EVELYN Oh. 
She quickly stubs one out. 
GITTES Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father? 
EVELYN No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out... 
GITTES Over the water department, or over you? 
EVELYN (quickly) Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me? 
GITTES (noting her nervousness) Then it was over the water department. 
EVELYN Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.

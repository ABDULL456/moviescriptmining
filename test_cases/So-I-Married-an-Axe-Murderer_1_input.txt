IN THE JOURNAL 
THIS POEM SUCKS 
After the last line he scratches out the entire poem. He closes the book and turns on the TV set to CNN to veg out. The show is "What's Cooking! With Burt Wolf." 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET 
Charlie is driving in his car. He drives slowly looking for an address. Finds it, slips in to a parking spot in front. 
EXT. BUTCHER'S SHOP - MEATS OF THE WORLD 
Adorning the front are a "GRAND OPENING" sign and miniature flags of the world. Charlie goes inside. 
INT. BUTCHER'S SHOP 
It's a small, hip shop selling specialty meats from around the world. Charlie looks around. Suddenly, an attractive woman in her late twenties, wearing a blood-stained smock enters. It is HARRIET MICHAELS. She has a cleaver in one hand and something bloody in the other. 
HARRIET (angry) Goddamn shoplifter. (conscious of Charlie's presence; holding up bloody meat) But I got him! (smiles) You're next. 
CHARLIE (backing out the door; terrified) I've come at a bad time. 
HARRIET No stay! 
CHARLIE No, no, really... Obviously you've got things you have to do. You've got to dismember the rest of his bloody torso. Dig a makeshift shallow grave. Cover the body with quick lime. Really so much to do, so little time and I'm only in the way here, I'm just gonna go. Good luck. 
HARRIET (referring to meat in hand) Oh, this! Oh, no, this is what he stole. This isn't a piece of him or anything. This is Icelandic Shank. 
CHARLIE I bet it goes well with a nice Chianti. Fittfittfitt. 
HARRIET (laughs) Can I help you? 
CHARLIE Yes. Do you have haggis? 
HARRIET Yes, we do. It's over here in our Scottish Cuts section. One? 
This is a section under glass flying a Scottish flag, with haggis and various cuts of Scottish meat. 
CHARLIE Yes! I've never been able to find haggis anywhere, except at my parents' house. They're Scottish. 
Harriet rounds the counter and wraps up the haggis. Behind her is the large "PRUSSIAN VENISON" sign. 
HARRIET (ringing up his order) That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine. Will there be anything else? 
CHARLIE Yes. I know it's a long shot, but you wouldn't by any chance happen to have any Prussian Venison? 
HARRIET Now where in the world would I get Prussian Venison? 
Charlie's charmed. 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET 
Charlie is driving along listening to Kerouac. We absorb the flavor of San Francisco as he drives down Lombard Street. 
EXT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
An old crappie apartment building in San Francisco. Charlie's car pulls up. We hear "SATURDAY NIGHT" by the Bay City Rollers. 
INT. OUTER HALLWAY OF CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Charlie approaches a door. 
CHARLIE (calling up) Mom, Dad, I'm here. 
STUART (O.S.) We're in here, son. 
The apartment is a shrine to Scotland. Scottish paraphernalia, miniature Scotty dogs, shortbread tins and, on wall, framed pictures depict famous Scotsmen, Sean Connery, Jackie Stewart, Alexander Graham Bell, James Doohan (Scottie from "Star Trek"), Sheena Easton, Billy Connolly. 
CHARLIE'S POV - AS WE ENTER THE LIVING ROOM 
We see STUART, MAY, TONY, and little WILLIAM, Charlie's fourteen year old little brother all singing:

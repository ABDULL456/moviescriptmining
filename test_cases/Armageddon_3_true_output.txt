A.J. I'm not going home Harry. 
With one hand, Harry stabs the airlock door, and then with a small pipe clamp,  rips A.J.'s air tubes off. 
Harry It's my hole, I drilled it, and I'm staying with it till the end. 
Harry grabs him, throws his kicking, screaming body into the airlock. A.J. is  choking. 
Harry (cont'd) She's always going to be my little girl. 
The door shuts automatically. Harry is now alone. 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AIRLOCK 
A.J. explodes from the airlock into the cabin. 
A.J. Goddamn it, HARRY....! 
A.J. lunges for the airlock. 
Sharp grabs A.J. with his good arm, helped by Bear..holding him back. 
A.J. LET ME GO....LET ME GO....!! 
SHARP YOU HAVE NO OXYGEN...YOUR TUBES ARE RIPPED...LET IT GO....!! 
A.J., sobbing, furious, POUNDS on the AIRLOCK WINDOW, staring at Harry outside. 
A.J. (pounding on the door) HARRY!! 
Harry turns and walks back to the drilling hole. Sharp looks at him. 
Sharp This guy really is a hero.... 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL REAR ROOM 
Skip Director? It's Mr. Stamper. He wants to talk to his daughter. 
Golden looks over at Grace. Their eyes meet.... 
A N.A.S.A. Tech hands Grace a mike and exits. She stares at the static on the  monitor. Harry's face fades in and out. Grace knows something is very wrong from  her father's strained, tired face. She forces a smile. INTERCUT with Harry  inside the Armadillo 
Grace Daddy. 
Harry (V.O.) Grace. I... (sighs) This is so hard for me. I don't have.... 
Tears start to well up in her eyes. 
Harry (V.O.) 
(cont'd) ...I just....want you to know how much I love you. 
Grace I'm so proud of you, Daddy. 
Grace wipes a tear from her face. 
Harry (V.O.) 
(looking at Earth) It's so beautiful up here. So pure. (swallows  hard) I remember something I read once..."The world is a fine place...and worth  fighting for."  looks at Earth, smiles) Gracie, I'm just an iron-ass-warrior doin'  what's best. (pause) Take care of A.J. I'll look in on you from time to time.... 
Harry pulls off the video link. Grace's monitors go black. Grace touches the  monitor, as Harry's face fades away. 
Her knees buckle. She sinks to the floor. 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
Harry looks at the detonator in hand. 
Harry You have three minutes and I'm not waiting. 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 
Watts and Sharp settle into the cockpit and begin flipping switches. 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
Harry, all business now, situates himself next to the nuke. The manual detonator  in his hand. 
Harry Let's go, Sharp. Get the hell off this rock. I WILL push this button. 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 
Sharp hits the THRUSTER SWITCH. 
EXT. FREEDOM 
The booster rockets SPUTTER and die. 
INT. FREEDOM - COCKPIT 
Nothing happens. He HITS it again. Again. 
Watts unbuckles and goes to the ENGINE IGNITION SYSTEM. 
The timer continues counting down to one thirty-four... One thirty-three... One thirty-two...

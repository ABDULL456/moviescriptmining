JIM KURRING What's that stand for? 
CLAUDIA Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched -- 
She's interupted by the call on his RADIO.  He takes the call. (Director's Note: Technical blah-blah-blah,etc.)

CAMERA DOLLIES IN A LITTLE ON JIM KURRING. 
JIM KURRING I'm sorry, Claudia. 
CLAUDIA What is it?  Did you forget something? 
JIM KURRING No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date. 
CLAUDIA You wanna go on a date with me? 
JIM KURRING Please, yes. 
CLAUDIA Well...is that illegal? 
JIM KURRING No. 
CLAUDIA Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do? 
JIM KURRING I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door. 
CLAUDIA Really? 
JIM KURRING Yeah. 
CLAUDIA I thought you were flirting with me a little.

CLAUDIA Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?

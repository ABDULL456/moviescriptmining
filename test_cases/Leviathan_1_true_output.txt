Willie types in a series of commands. 
BECK What are you doing? 
WILLIE Seeing how my stock's doing... 
ON SCREEN:  The words TransOcean Corp.  The capsulized report comes up on screen:  "TransOcean Corp. took a bath on world markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was revealed to investors.  The Board of Directors...." 
WILLIE (impatiently) Where?.... 
She scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the words. 
THE SCREEN:  "...accident took place in Shack Six, Southeast Sector of Pacific Zone 10...Seven dead.  All bodies missing."  Their names follow. 
ON WILLIE  as her name comes up she shivers. 
BECK I can't believe they'd just leave us. 
A voice behind them causes them to turn. 
JONES Welcome to the union, boss. We're all expendable. 
He is now awake.  He sits up against the air vent.  Suddenly, Beck listens, the room is deathly silent.  He looks over to the air vent.  Jones is listening also. 
WILLIE What is it? 
JONES The air's stopped. 
WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds hysterically. A blue light on the console blinks on and off.  It says "AIR."  Beck turns to the instruments. 
BECK We're on backup air. 
WILLIE How much time does that give us? 
BECK Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct. 
WILLIE Can't we fix it? 
JONES There're twenty miles of pipe in the bilge, they could have tapped-in anywhere. 
SUDDENLY WE HEAR A SOUND WE HAVEN'T HEARD IN A LONG TIME. The RATTLE THAT JONES AND COBB FIXED.  Jones and Beck home in on the tell-tale noise. 
JONES (almost to himself) Cobb...Job security... 
He locks eyes with Beck. 
BECK They're drawing us out. 
He leaves his seat and Jones checks his weapon as Willie watches. 
WILLIE You can't go out there, that's what they want. 
Beck checks his make-shift flamethrower. 
BECK We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and-- 
JONES Crunch...Implosion. 
Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining tools, the laser-drill, she powers-it up to check it.  Her action stops both men and she catches their looks. 
WILLIE You don't think I'm sitting in here, do you? 
INT. CORRIDOR "A" - SAME 
Carefully the three move into the Lower Ring Corridor.  As they move we suddenly hear a new sound, DEEP, LIKE DISTANT THUNDER.  The sides of the shack tremble slightly. 
WILLIE (low) The shack... 
JONES She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought. 
BECK (to Jones) Which way?

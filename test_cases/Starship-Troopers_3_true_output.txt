CARMEN You can't walk me home. 
JOHNNY Why not ? 
CARMEN I thought you were going to help Carl. 
JOHNNY Carl can wait. 
CARMEN Johnny, my Dad's home today. 
Johnny's face darkens with frustration. 
JOHNNY What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager ! 
CARMEN It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran. 
JOHNNY Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ? 
CARMEN Sometimes I do what I want, eh ? 
Carmen steps into the flux.	ZAPPP!	She's gone. Johnny grins, happy to be in love. 
12	INT	CARL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY - JOHNNY 
is hard-wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise Carl's basement workshop. Carl concentrates on the image of a playing card, the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor. 
CARL Don't think about it... go on instinct. 
JOHNNY Ace of spades. 
The ace of spades appears, and the computer indicates "no match". Carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds. 
CARL Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know. 
JOHNNY In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts. 
Wrong again. 
CARL Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't. Federal studies like this might provide a clue. 
The next card up is the nine of clubs. 
JOHNNY I wouldn't want to know what everyone was thinking. Four of spades. 
Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor. Johnny removes the blindfold. 
CARL Cyrano, you big yellow turd ! 
Johnny knows this frog, scratches him on the neck. 
JOHNNY He just wants attention. You don't play with him like you used to. 
Carl concentrates for a moment. 
CARL Go bug Mom, Cyrano. 
Cyrano's eyes widen. He hops off the table and up the stairs two at a time. Carl clears the screen. 
JOHNNY How do you make him do that ? 
CARL I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it. 
From upstairs, CARL'S MOM shrieks. 
MOM (O.S.) Get out ! Get out ! CARL...! 
JOHNNY Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that to me. 
CARL Don't be afraid. Can't do humans... yet. C'mon let's go. 
Carl, puts up more cards, Johnny misses them all. 
JOHNNY Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ? 
CARL Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ? 
JOHNNY I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe. 
CARL Your father will never let you. 
JOHNNY I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know. 
CARL Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ? 
JOHNNY Eight point... no, uh, seven... 
CARL If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance. 
JOHNNY All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.

Esther Milo, watching. 
RENE (CONT'D) I'm starving. You can't buy    advertising like this. This is the most    glamorous dinner you'll have here this    fall. How about some of that imitation    crab? 
MR. CHOW I'm not paying for the drawing with crab. It's a present to my friends. It's my birthday. 
Jean finishes his drawing - a big beautiful head that fills the screen. 
Rene grabs it from him. He holds it up for everyone to see. 
RENE Isn't he great? Thanks, Jean. 
He rips the page from the book. 
RENE (CONT'D) He owes me one. 
Everyone's face drops. Mr. Chow grabs his book. He motions to a couple WAITERS - 
MR. CHOW You're too much, Rene. Get this guy out of here. 
RENE I haven't eaten yet!!! 
The waiters grab Rene's arms. 
RENE (CONT'D) Hands off me, you faggots! I'm going. I'm going...I've kept Diana Vreeland waiting too long, anyway. 
ANDY WARHOL Wow... That was a nice drawing, too, Jean. Maybe you should do another one. 
MR. CHOW (exhausted) Some other time. 
Spontaneously, David McDermott climbs onto the tabletop downstairs and sings "Paris Je T'aime." 
As he belts it out in a theatrical falsetto, he glides over glasses and plates, executing a leap to another table in mid- song. 
The restaurant staff and OTHER DINNER GUESTS watch, agape. 
CLOSE UP - DAVID'S SHOES. 
As David dances, Annina walks over to the table, greeting people and saying goodnight. 
ANNINA NOSEI (to Jean) It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio. 
BASQUIAT Sure. 
Annina leaves. 
Jean leans back in his chair, taking in this splendid new world. He pulls out a joint, lights up, inhales with pleasure, closes his eyes and smiles. 
SUPER OVER HIS FACE: "FOUR YEARS LATER" 
SCREEN GOES BLACK 
INTERVIEWER (O.S.) ... had twenty-three one man shows, been in forty three group shows from Zurich to Tokyo.. 
FADE UP 
INT. GREAT JONES STREET LOFT - DAY 
Note: The following scene is shot in documentary style. 
INTERVIEWER (O.S, CONT'D) ... had over fifty articles written about you, switched galleries - how many times? - DJ'd in the hottest clubs - 
Jean looks out the window, yawns and rubs his eyes. He now sports dreadlocks bundled into groups of spikes sticking out of his head. He wears a wrinkled Wesleyan College T-shirt, paint- splattered jeans, and no shoes; just out of bed, it would seem. 
An INTERVIEWER - a balding Brit with all the humor of a bank clerk - tries to buddy up with Jean on camera. 
INTERVIEWER   (CONT'D) ... one of the youngest    artists ever to be included in the Whitney    Biennial, also produced a rap record.    It's said you're quite the ladies man -    even dated Madonna for a couple months!!! (takes a breath) All at the ripe old age    of 24. One might ask: is there anything    left for Jean Michel Basquiat to do? 
Jean and the interviewer face each other in front of one of Jean's paintings. Jean stares at the interviewer, incredulous. 
INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? (nervous laugh) 
BASQUIAT I hate this. Turn that off. 
Jean walks off camera and disappears into his bedroom. 
Shenge (the former limo driver, now working as Jean's assistant) assembles stretchers. 
SUPER: "GREAT JONES STREET, 1985" 
A CAMERA CREW waits in the room. Jean returns. 
INTERVIEWER We're running a little late.

JOLENE Oh my God! 
HILLY Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a LSU game and sold him a hotdog. And, boy, he got a whole lot more. All the girls laugh. 
SKEETER Could have been you, Hilly. 
HILLY And live thirty minutes outside of town? Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty parlor, and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the children's benefit. 
SKEETER Aren't we taking non-members? The benefit's gotten so big. 
HILLY Yes, but we're not telling her. Everyone laughs but Skeeter. Aibileen pours Skeeter a cup of coffee. Skeeter looks up decidedly and smiles. 
SKEETER Thank you, Aibileen. Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point. Elizabeth leans over. 
ELIZABETH Oh, Hilly, I wish you'd just go use the bathroom. 
HILLY Ah-hem. I'm fine. Missus Walters shouts out from the sofa. 
MISSUS WALTERS She's upset cause the nigra uses the guest bath, and so do we. Elizabeth turns to Aibileen. 
ELIZABETH Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley. Aibileen disappears. Elizabeth leans into Hilly. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Just go use mine and Raleigh's. Hilly hiss-whispers. 
HILLY If Aibileen uses the guest bathroom, I'm sure she uses yours too. 
ELIZABETH 
SHE DOES NOT! Aibileen turns the corner in the hall and stops. 
HILLY Wouldn't you rather them take their business outside? Skeeter sees a reflection of Aibileen listening off of a picture in the hall. Skeeter tries to change the subject. 
SKEETER Did y'all see the cover of "Life" this week? Jackie's never looked 
MORE REGAL- 
HILLY -Tell Raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell. It's just plain dangerous. Everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do. I double. Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her cards. 
ELIZABETH I can't ask Raleigh until tax season. But, it would be nice. 
HILLY That's why I've drafted The Home Help Sanitation Initiative. 
SKEETER "The Home"...the what?! 
HILLY As a disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help. I've even notified the Surgeon General of Mississippi. I'll pass. Skeeter again glances at Aibileen. Their eyes meet. 
SKEETER Maybe we ought to just build you a bathroom outside, Hilly. The room grows eerily quiet. 
HILLY You ought not to joke about the colored situation. Hilly leans in toward Skeeter. 
HILLY (CONT'D) I'll do whatever it takes to protect our town. Your lead, Jolene. Jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock. She jumps up and throws her cards to the table. 
JOLENE I have to skedaddle! Gotta get over to the station! 
(EXCITEDLY) Daddy's letting me do the weather tonight! 
EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - BACKYARD - SAME DAY 
Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers. As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround a perfectly manicured lawn. "Tara" pales in comparison. Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) Now, Miss Celia had her a man. `Bout the best lookin' man in all of Mississippi. But, no baby and no friends. JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband, sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie. 
JOHNNY Roses look like weeds next to you. Celia turns with a yelp. She slaps him playfully. 
CELIA Johnny, you scared the daylights out of me! Johnny begins kissing her neck. 
CELIA (CONT'D) You're home early. Celia pushes him back. 
CELIA (CONT'D) Johnny, I can't get any of your old friends from school to call me back. 
JOHNNY Oh, who cares, honey. We got all we need right here. Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass. 
CELIA Johnny, honestly! 
JOHNNY Doctor's orders. Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts. She becomes uneasy and rolls out from under him. 
CELIA I don't know what's taking us so long. I'm sorry. Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face. 
JOHNNY Hey, we've never done it in the yard. Maybe that's the trick. Celia seductively bites her lower lip. 
CELIA Watch my hair. Johnny's hand slides up her thigh. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY 
Bridge over, Skeeter smokes while watching through a window as Minny arrives in Hilly's car. Skeeter blows smoke toward Hilly and Elizabeth saying good-bye.

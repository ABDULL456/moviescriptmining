ED Where the hell have you been? 
CHARLIE You said after school, chill out! Ed is already lugging his big duffle to Adam's front door. 
ED Right after! It's dusk, dude, you know what that means!? 
CHARLIE That the sun's gone down. What's 
THE BIG-- Over him, Ed knocks loudly. Rings the bell. 
ED Hey! Anybody home? A long pause. Nothing. 
CHARLIE Not here. Let's go-- But Ed's already heading around the house with the duffle. 
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DUSK 
Ed wriggles in through the DOG DOOR. He turns, lets Charlie in. Charlie looks around. 
CHARLIE This is nuts. It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's proper place. It's perfect. They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared. 
ED Hello? Ed and Charlie here! 
(TO CHARLIE) Come on. Charlie follows him in. Resigned and placating. 
CHARLIE Okay. Fine. Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY WATER, even a small AX. 
ED Take this. Ed hands Charlie a STAKE. Charlie eyes it, incredulous. 
CHARLIE You've got to be kidding me. Ed stops. This is it. 
ED I hate to tell you this but that guy, your neighbor. 
(DEAD SERIOUS) He's a vampire. One of the undead. 
CHARLIE My neighbor. Next door. 
ED Yeah. 
CHARLIE I just met him. Jerry. 
ED Jerry. A beat. 
CHARLIE That's a terrible vampire name. "Jerry." Seriously-- 
ED I didn't name him, man, I'm just reporting the facts! Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's darker up here. Lights off. 
CHARLIE Come on, this is a gag -- right? Ed's barely listening -- cautious. Every shadow is potential death. Total shmuck bait... 
ED Hey! Anybody here? They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty. Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery. Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him. The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY HIDING BEHIND the door. A LARGE MALE figure. Ed catches sight of the guy, and SPINS toward it, freaked. Charlie also reacts, scared. 
ED (CONT'D) Get back, demon! Ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open, toppling A MOVIE CHARACTER STANDEE. A beat. Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh. 
ED (CONT'D) Ha! I killed that sucker dead! 
CHARLIE 
(ANGRY) They're not here, okay? They left town. His dad was a deadbeat-- Ed pulls a MAP out of his pocket. It has lots of red and black DOTS marked on it. He thrusts it at Charlie. 
ED No, see, it's not just them. It started -- there was this thing on Channel 13, a lady escaped an attacker who tried to bite her. Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose circle around CHARLIE'S house. 
ED (CONT'D) Adam and me, we graphed the attack, the disappearances. Whole families, gone.

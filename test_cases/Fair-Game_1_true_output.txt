SAWSAN I'm a doctor. I work hard. I'm also a mother. I have a small girl and I'm all she has. 
VALERIE We can help your brother. Right now he is extremely valuable to us. 
SAWSAN And to Saddam. The Mukbarat watch him night and day. 
VALERIE He could come here Sawsan. He's an expert physicist. He'd have a job, his children, his family would be safe. You, your daughter could see him whever you want. Sawsan. Can you help us? 
SAWSAN I won't do anything to help you. I don't know you. I would only do this for Sa'ad. 
VALERIE Then do it for Sa'ad. 
Valerie watches her. 
SAWSAN What would I have to do? 
ESTABLISHING. SHIMMERING CITYSCAPE OF AMMAN. JORDAN. NIGHT. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. NIGHT. 
Westerners mix with Mid-Easterners. A tea trolley crosses the floor and disappears into a service elevator. 
INT. TWELVE FLOOR CORRIDOR./HOTEL SUITE. NIGHT. 
The elevator opens and a tea trolley stops outside room 1201. The door is opened by Valerie's colleague. Ali. It is wheeled inside. As Ali signs, cups of tea are poured. 
He carries one into THE BEDROOM and hands it to Sawsan, who sits on the edge of a bed wearing a long black traditional Abaya. There are two other agents there, with Valerie. One of them is holding a notebook.. 
AGENT 1 The pages of this notebook are fast burning. You write on them like normal, but if you need to destroy them in an emergency.. 
He whips out a zippo. Sets fire to one. It's gone in a flash. 
AGENT 1 You have two of these in your luggage. Now this is the only pen we want you to use.. 
The other agent shows her a pen. 
AGENT 2 The ink in this pen is visible for 10 seconds. Only when given the the correct chemical fixative can it be read. 
SAWSAN - I am not taking any of this. If the Mukhbarat find any of this they will do things to me you cannot imagine. Tell me what you need to know. I will memorise it. 
AGENT 2 Ma'am, we have 50 very specific questions, some extremely technical. 
SAWSAN You have 206 different bones in your body. Do you want their names in english, latin or arabic? 
They look to Val for a decision. She can't help but smile. 
CUT TO: 
Later. The agents have gone. Just Sawsan and Valerie. 
VALERIE How do you feel? 
She's trying to drink her tea, but she's shaking. Val takes her hand and silently grips it. 
VALERIE Just remember, if anyone asks you anything, if anyone stops you stay calm and tell the truth. You're just visiting your brother. Keep it simple and keep to the truth. 
SAWSAN Except it's not the truth. How do you do it? 
She searches Valerie's face. 
SAWSAN How do you be someone you're not? How do you lie to someone? To their face. How do you do it? 
Valerie looks at her. Before she can answer we -- 
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE -- Ali checks his watch. Knocks on the door. Opens it. Valerie and Sawsan look up from the edge of bed. 
ALI It's time. 
EXT. QUEEN ALIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. AMMAN. JORDAN. 
A taxi cab stops and SAWSAN is helped out by the driver. 
From a car across the street -- Valerie watches: 
Sawsan rolls her suitcase into the terminal. At the door she glances behind her...and disappears inside. 
Ali and Valerie get out the car looking every bit like tourists, suitcases, sunglasses, guidebook etc. 
INT. QUEEN ALIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. AMMAN. JORDAN.

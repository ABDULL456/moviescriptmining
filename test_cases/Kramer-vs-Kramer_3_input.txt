Ted looks at Billy in amazement. 
WIDE SHOT 
As the two of them enter the school and disappear from view. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OFFICE, TED'S AGENCY  DAY 
ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS 
As they open and Ted steps out looking like the wrath of God. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he crosses the waiting room toward the inner offices. 
ON THE RECEPTIONIST 
Glancing up as he passes. 
RECEPTIONIST (cheerful) Congratulations, Mr. Kramer. 
ON TED 
Looking at her like she has lost her mind. Nevertheless he continues on, passing through swinging doors into a long corridor lined with secretaries' desks and offices leading off of it. 
Suddenly a younger man rushes up, grabs Ted's hand and starts to pump it vigorously. 
YOUNG MAN Terrific news, Ted. 
Another nut. Ted smiles at the man, humoring him and continues toward his office. O'Connor appears, throwing his arm around Ted, squeezing him in a bear hug. 
O'CONNOR Hey... Look who was out celebrating last night. 
Suddenly Ted realizes that all these people are congratulating him for getting the Fire and Ice account. 
TED (trying to appear nonchalant) Uh, Jim... Can I talk to you? 
CUT TO: 
INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY 
Ted and O'Connor sitting across from one another. O'Connor has just heard the news. 
O'CONNOR Jesus Christ. That's a real blockbuster. (shakes his head) I always figured you guys had it made. 
TED (morose) You want to know the real kicker? The real kicker is, for the first time in my life  the first time  I feel like a loser. 
O'Connor nods sympathetically. Actually he is praying that Ted won't start to cry. 
O'CONNOR (stiff upper lip) Listen, don't let it get you down. (doesn't believe it for a second) You're going to be fine. 
TED (toujour gai) Me? I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine. 
O'CONNOR Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay? Three marriages, two divorces... You're gonna be okay. 
TED (wishful thinking) I'm going to be okay. The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time. 
O'CONNOR (emphatically) She'll be back... 
Ted nods in agreement. There is a beat of silence as both men consider Joanna's imminent return. Then: 
O'CONNOR (trying to be tactful) But... just in case... I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid? 
TED (the wind goes out of him) I don't know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so... Pow  like that. 
O'CONNOR (a friend having to say something very difficult) Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay? But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while. Just until you get yourself straightened out. 
TED (doubtfully) I don't know, Jim... 
O'CONNOR (the Dutch uncle) Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us  that's you and me  to deliver the goods. Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose  
TED Jim, I appreciate what you're saying. I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back. 
ON O'CONNOR 
Clearly he doesn't believe this. 
O'CONNOR I hope you're right, Ted... I really hope you're right. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOYER  KRAMER APT.  DAY 
INSERT: TIGHT ON AN ENVELOPE 
It is postmarked Denver, Colorado. The letter is addressed to Billy Kramer and it is from Joanna. 
ON TED 
As he rips open the letter. 
TED Billy! 
ON BILLY 
He sits in the living room watching television, a chocolate doughnut in one hand and a remote control device for watching television in the other. 
Off-screen Sound: a Saturday morning kiddie program from the television set. 
BILLY (focused on T.V.) Uh, huh... 
TED You got a letter from mom. 
Instantly, Billy turns down the volume of the television.

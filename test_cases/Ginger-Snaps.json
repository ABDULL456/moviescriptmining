{"test1_input": "BRIGITTE Teen cult my ass. Look Ginge', something went for its throat - it's not cut, it's chewed... Brigitte looks up in time to see Ginger's eyes roll back in her head. Ginger faints. The class inhales as one. \nBRIGITTE Ginger? Sykes and the class stampede up. Sykes pushes Brigitte out of the way. \nBRIGITTE (V/0) Ginger's no pussy. She doesn't faint. I might faint. Like, if this pooch were only HALF-dead, I could faint. Brigitte stumbles over the dog carcass. She hugs herself. \nINT. NURSE' S OFFICE -- DAY \nBrigitte sits in her bloodied uniform, chewing her nails. NURSE FERRY - a Mrs. Doubtfi.re-type who chirps more than speaks - is examining Ginger. \nFERRY The fainting' s worrisome you don't diet do you dear? \nGINGER No. \nFERRY Hm. Anemia's very common at your age. Eat more red meat, try an iron vitamin supplement. If it happens again, straight to a proper doctor, all righty? Brigitte looks relieved. \nFERRY Now as for 'the headache, cramps, lower back pain .I'm guessing your period is due. \nGINGER I haven't got a, um, period. \nFERRY Never? Flow old are you? \nGINGER Fifteen. our mother says we're late bloomers. \nFERRY Well judging by your troubles, I'd say you can expect to blossom any time now! Brigitte pulls a face. Ferry produces numerous samples of feminine hygiene products and heaps them onto Ginger. \nFERRY Are you familiar with all these? Ginger shrugs. \nFERRY Now what suits one girl might not be comfortable for another. The proper form of protection is a personal choice, and may have a lot to do with your menstrual flow, which naturally changes during the time you'll have your little miracle of nature. It could start thick and syrupy, move to a straight-forward basic bright red bleeding and then perhaps a deep brownish to blackish slime, signaling the end of the flow. Twenty-eight days later or there abouts, it'll start all over again and continue every month until menopause, in about thirty years' time. Nurse Ferry produces a pocket calendar with a tampon or pad advertisement for every month. \nFERRY (CON'T) Here's a little calendar to keep track, count from the day it starts twenty-eight days. That'll be your next time. You have any questions, come see me again. (to Brigitte) You too sweetheart, be your turn shortly, I expect. Brigitte Looks horrified. \nEXT. A SUBURBAN STREET/TRAVELING - DAY \nBRIGITTE (V/O) Here's a dirty word. Inevitability. That fate fully intended us to be typical in any way, sooner or later, was so insulting. Ginger and Brigitte trudge homeward looking completely depressed. Brigitte flips through the feminine hygiene calendar. Ginger watches the pavement beneath her feet. \nBRIGITTE (reading a panty- liner ad) \"Some days it's all you need.\"-? What does that mean? \nGINGER So you pulled a Quincy on that dog, unh? \nBRIGITTE Hunh? Ginger grabs the calendar and sticks it in her pocket. \nGINGER Quincy, that guy with the stiffs on cable. Alls I remember is you goin', \"Teen cult my ass\". \nBRIGITTE Oh. Right. Well, I dunno. Brigitte shrugs. She gives Ginger a funny look. \nGINGER Why are you looking at me like that? Do I look - different? \nBRIGITTE No. \nGINGER Can you tell I'm going to-? \nBRIGITTE No. .Really. Ginger squints at her, unconvinced. \n", "test1_true": "GINGER Wham. Total adultness. How can I have a miracle of nature an, not be old enough to drive! fiurih? The fuck. Ginger kicks a kiddie toy hard into a yard. Brigitte doesn't have an answer to this. \nEXT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - DAY \nTheir house looks like a set in a home show. The girls take it in from the front drive with expressions of complete weariness. Next door, Norman the terrier barks at them. \nGINGER Hey. If I start simpin' around tampon dispensers and moanin' over cramps, or even think about buying somethin' that says Baby Powder Fresh? You'll. shoot me, right? BR TG.'i\"I'L of course. They exchange grins. \nGINGER Out by sixteen \nBRIGITTE .or dead in this scene. Ginger raises her hand and Brigitte smacks it hard. As they mount the drive, Ginger picks up a stone and hucks it at Norman, who's still barking. She misses. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) If we failed to get a life by Ginger's sixteenth birthday? we were s'posed to gas ourselves in the garage. For smart girls, we could be pretty dumb. we prob'ly never woulda done it, but we seemed to need a deadline. \nINT. FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe Fitzgerald family are having their evening meal. Their parents, HENRY (see Men's Section, Seers catalogue) and \nPAMELA (see Martha Stewart's Idea of Living), are liberal, middle class folks in their early forties. Ginger looks bored. Brigitte eats like a pig. \nHENRY How was school today? \nGINGER Fine. \nBRIGITTE (V/U) The nicest thing I could say about Henry and Pamela was also the meanest thing I could say. \nPAMELA Didn't you have a presentation? How'd it go? \nGINGER Fine. Pamela and Henry exchange irritatingly patient smiles. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) They were easily satisfied. A rogue's gallery on the wall depicts Henry and Pamela's transformation over the years from angry young Ban The Bomb- types into middle-class mundane. \nPAMELA Made an appointment for you girls at my gynecologist. Next Thursday. Henry studies his plate. Ginger almost imperceptibly shakes her head at Brigitte. Brigitte nods, understanding. \nGINGER why. \nPAMELA You know why. \nGINGER we're not going to a gynecologist. \nPAMELA What did I say about that tone of voice? .You are going to the gynecologist. \nGINGER Dad!? She's completely paranoid! \nHENRY I'd rather stay out of this. \nGINGER She's gonna have some fat jerk get his jollies poking his fingers up our ./ \nHENRY \n(INTERRUPTING) I'm actually eating here. \n", "test1_id": 1569, "test2_input": "GINGER It's gross though. It's really gross. I better, ya know, deal with that... \nBRIGITTE Yeah, sure. Ginger's only half-bandaged up. she staggers to the bathroom and shuts the door. Brigitte eyes the Polaroid camera: a picture sits ready to be dispensed. She pulls it free. We do not see the photo. Brigitte's eyes bug out as she examines it. The toilet flushes in the bathroom and Brigitte pushes the photo under the pillow on her bed. Shaking her head. \nBRIGITTE (V/0) It was blurry. It was really outta focus, so. Ya couldn't TELL it was really anything. Ginger emerges pulling uncomfortably at her crotch. she climbs painfully onto her bed, and collapses. \nGINGER That booze - straight to my head, man. \nBRIGITTE You really okay? Ginger-es eyes are already fluttering shut. \nGINGER You saved me. Love you. Bee. Brigitte leans in, listening to Ginger breathe. \nBRIGITTE Me too, Ginge'. \nGINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15. 1996 30 \nINT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nBrigitte sits straight up in bed, sweating, with eyes wide. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) I woke up later, I thought the thing was in our room. Brigitte peers at Ginger: she's snoring. Brigitte pulls out the Polaroid and fires up her lighter to see by. This time we see it too. A streak of fur, fangs and a golden glinting eye. \nBRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0) Then I remembered Sam the tree planter killed it with his truck, an' we were okay. .But really, Ginger -? well. Wasn't. \nEXT. BAILEY HIGH GROUNDS - DAY \nIt's noon hour. The grounds are full. of teens. Brigitte is eating as she ticks off the fourth day in Ginger's feminine hygiene calendar. Brigit:Le counts 28 days from the first check mark. Her pen hovers over the date: Halloween, arid the next full moon. The first day was a full moon. Brigitte slowly circles them both. Ginger wears long sleeves to hide her bandages, and shades. She's looking BOYS up and down as they pass. Ginger's stomach is growling. An untouched sandwich sits on her lap. \nBRIGITTE Gonna eat that? Ginger shakes her head as she picks at her bandages. Brigitte helps herself. \nBRIGITTE Mmm! Sad, but Pamela's egg salad is her best thing. Like that she can do. (no response) Like, when she puts the baby onions in? (no response) And she gobs on it and adds those hard little pieces of \nBOOGER Ginger pulls at her own crotch. \nBRIGITTE Hell-o 1? \nGINGER Sorry. Pads suck, so ya know. \nBRIGITTE Should eat something. \nGINGER Thanks Pamela, I'm aware. Off Brigitte's insulted look, \nGINGER T dunno, I'm all blaaahh, I got this, like I can taste what I want, but nothin's it. Ya know? Brigitte stops in mid-chew. \nBRIGITTE A craving? \nGINCER Yeah. I crave. Ya know? Brigitte chews very slowly as she stares at Ginger. Ginger squints at Jason and his pals across the yard. \nGINGER McCardy's a stoner right? \nBRIGITTE Yeah -? \nGINGER C'mon, I wanna feel better. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. BAILEY HIGH GROUNDS/SCHOOL STEPS - DAY \nJason and his pals' butcho conversation sputters as Ginger strides up like a cat in heat. Brigitte stumbles up behind her, keeping her distance. \nGINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1998 32 \nJASON Uh - hi. \nGINGER Hey. So. Nice day, blah blah blah. Got any smoke? \nJASON What? \nGINGER Smoke. Grass, weed, dope, green, bud, Nancy. \nJASON Sh-sure. \nGINGER Wanna share? \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY \nBrigitte hesitates before a rusted-out old boogie van, it's rear door open and waiting. Blue smoke billows out. of the interior. Brigitte looks confused. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) I was all like, so who are you, an' what have you done with my sister, right? Brigitte climbs in. \nINT. VAN - DAY \nGinger, Jason, Tim, Frank and Jeremy sit toking a gagger. The guys are giddy with lust. Brigitte is huddled in a corner, attempting invisibility. Jason hands Ginger the joint, making sure their fingers touch. \nJASON Hey. I thought your slide show in art was cool. \nOTHER GUYS Oh yeah/Unh-huh/Very cool. \nGINGER Yeah? \nJason and Ginger exchange a coy smile that makes Brigitte toke really hard on her pass. Brigitte passes the dube to Tim, who winks at her. Brigitte sneers and looks at her watch. She makes a pained face at Ginger, but is ignored. \nGINGER This home-grown? \nJASON Yeah. This guy we know? Learned hydrophonics in the pen, man. \nBRIGITTE HydroPONics. \nJASON Yeah, whatever. Brigitte gapes at Ginger, who does not respond. Brigitte hides beneath her hair and presses even further into a corner. She starts quietly ripping up the corner of the old shag rug. There is a codified knock on the vain door. Brigitte jumps. \nJASON speak of the devil. Enter! The back doors open and Sam (the tree planter) stands in silhouette, backlit by the day. His battered county truck waits behind him. He has a pit bull with him - MORELY. \nBOYS Sam the Man! Hey Morely! Sam and Morely hop in and close the doors. Brigitte is frozen at the sight of Sam up so close. \nTIM Whoa dude. What happened to your truck? \nSAM Shit. Had an accident on the 403. It was weird it../ Morely stomps into Brigitte's lap, sniffing her crotch. \n", "test2_id": 1570, "test3_input": "JASON Hey. whatcha doin' now? \nGINGER Nothin' special. \nJASON Wanna go for a ride? \nGINGER Sure. C'mon Bee. Jason and Brigitte's faces darken simultaneously. \nBRIGITTE Ginger, we should get home. \nGINGER No we shouldn't. Brigitte drags Ginger aside. Ginger notes Brigitte's hand squeezing her arm with a dangerous look. \nBRIGITTE Twenty minutes ago you coulda killed somebody. Is this really a good time to start dating? I don't think so. Ginger shakes Brigitte's hand off. \nGINGER Well, I do. \nBRIGITTE Why? \nGINGER Why?! Look, grow up a little an' maybe you'll get it \nBRIGITTE What. \nGINGER Forget it, I'm goin'. I'll draw ya a picture later, 'kay? Ginger takes Jason's hand and pulls him off to the exit. Jason gives Brigitte SUCH a smug look over his shoulder. Brigitte stands alone in the hall, gaping after them. \nEXT BAILEY HIGH - LATE DAY \nBRIGITTE (V/O) When Henry renovated the basement, to build our room? I was like ten an, in the way an, shit. Well, he rammed iue with this beam, right in my stomach. Accidentally. Brigitte wanders over the emptying school. lot. She looks small and alone. She looks disoriented. \nBRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0) But all the air came outta my lungs at once an, I kept tryin' to breathe but I couldn't. I forgot all about that. Till like right now. Brigitte consults the hygiene calendar. Ginger's ending the third week of checked-off days. A special note on today's date asks DO YOU HAVE PMS? \nEXT. HILL CREST -- DUSK \nJason's van is parked on a rise that offers an impressive overview of Bailey Downs. Crickets sing. The moon is rising. \nINT. THE VAN - DUSK \nGinger and Jason sit in the front seat of his van. They're making out. Ginger is enjoying herself. Ginger bites his lip. Ginger draws blood. \nJASON Ouch! whoa. Can't believe you never had a boyfriend... Ginger licks his blood from her own lips and freezes dead cold. Jason dives back at her for more. Ginger looks both aroused and unnerved by her arousal. Ginger's stomach growls. Ginger pushes Jason off of her. \nGINGER I have to go. It's getting late. \nJASON It's only six o'clock. Jason presses himself on her again. Ginger shoves him off, hard. \nGINGER 1-have-to-go. \nJASON Oh. Now you get all moody on me? \nGINGER Hey_ You got no idea. \nEXT. HILLCREST - DUSK \nGinger slams the van door and rushes away from the van. \n", "test3_true": "JASON (O/S) Cock tease! \nEXT. BAILEY STREET - DUSK \nBrigitte shuffles along the curb, the picture of dejection. She slows to watch Sam loading some enormous tree branches into the back of his truck, packing up for the night: lie has \nbeen cutting back an enormous tree in someone's front yard. when Sam glances her way, Brigitte picks up her pace without looking back. \nEXT. PARK AREA - NIGHT \nTrina wears a radio headset that pounds post-disco dance mix as she jogs. Morely dashes in and out of the surrounding greenery. He dashes in once more, and does not reappear. Trina looks back expectantly. She runs in place, waiting for him. She heads back, looking for him. Ginger pops out of the brush before Trina. Gingers face smeared with blood from Mo.rely. Ginger grins insanely. Ginger wiggles Morely's collar. Trina clicks off her head set. \nGINGER Hi! \nINT FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - NIGHT Brigitte descends the stairs to her room. Music blasts from the basement. \nPAMELA (O/S) Brigitte? Tell your sister to turn that stereo down! \nINT. GIRLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nBrigitte lets herself in. The music is now deafening. Trina is bound in a chair at the end of her bed, screaming her head off. Her screams are buried by the music. Brigitte slams and locks the door behind her. \nGINGER (yelling over noise) Stop screaming or I'll rip your permed head right off you neck. An' ya know what? I can do that. Now open wide Ginger force-feeds Trina something on a spoon. Trina screams with her mouth full, trying to spit it back out. Ginger offers Trina a glass of milk. \nGINGER Chaser? No? \nGINGER SNAPS-WALTON/July 15, 1996 59 Blood trickles out of the corners of Trinas mouth as she chews while bawling. Ginger sets the glass of milk on the desk. \nBRIGITTE Ginger WHAT are you doing-! Ginger grins and shows Bee a bowl of crushed glass and tacks. \nGINGER Jus' like you said, Bee! S' perfect! Brigitte grabs the bowl away: glass shards and tacks rain around them. \nBRIGITTE Are you crazy?! \nGINGER Hey! I'm Join' this for you! As the sisters argue, Trina rocks the chair back and forth, trying to free herself. \nBR I G ITTE Oh no, no way... No! \nGINGER Yer still burnt over Jason! \nBR I G ITTE No, Ginger, I'm burnt 'cause you don't see like jail in yer future! You don't get how hugely fucked this is! DO you? Trina lurches back hard and rocks forward. Trina struggles to get her toes to meet the floor. She lurches back for more momentum. \nGINGER You sayin' I'm stupid?! \nBRIGITTE I'm sayin' she? Will tell on you! This is someone who will tell! Trina throws herself forward again and her toes connect firmly with the floor - just as her temple connects with a sickening CRACK on the sharp corner of the desk. The milk glass dumps on top of her. \nBrigitte and Ginger look at her. Trina hangs there in the chair at this strange angle for a moment, dripping milk. Then Trina and the chair keel to the floor. Trina is still. Brigitte turns the music off and creeps up to Trina. Blood trickles out of Trina's ear and swirls into the milky glass mess at her mouth. Her open eyes stare at nothing. She's dead. \nGINGER Ha-ha. Ginger grabs her own right arm (most damaged by the original attack) and shudders with pain. \nGINGER Ow. Ow. Owchee-wow-ow. Brigitte takes Trina in from head to toe. Brigitte checks Trina for a pulse. Brigitte snaps her hand back as though it were burned. A tremor wracks Brigitte's body and she convulses. Brigitte runs to the bathroom. OFF SCREEN, Brigitte throws up. Meanwhile Ginger raises her afflicted hand. The hand is nowsomething clearly on the way to being a wolfen paw. The nails are black, curling claws. Oblivious, Brigitte climbs back into bed and covers her face with a pillow. \n", "test3_id": 1571}

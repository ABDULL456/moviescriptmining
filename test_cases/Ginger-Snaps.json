{"train": "GINGER SNAPS \nWritten by \nKaren Walton \nJuly 15th, 1996 \nFADE IN \nEXT. FITZGERALD HOME -- NIGHT \nThe house is dark. The moon is almost full. A dog barks. A melancholy voice, worn for its age, narrates: BRIGITTE (V/o) Ever try bein' different? An, I don't mean jus' thinkin' about it, either. Ginger an' me - I mean I... The house numbers read 669. The 9 slips: the number now reads 666. \nBRIGITTE (CON'T/V/O) Ginger an' I? Went for different. Big time. There's a light on in a basement window. We creep up to it, crushing the tulip. borders on the way. The window is propped open with a sneaker: it looks like somebody's foot is caught in it. Music plays inside- \nINT. GIRLS' BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGyrating in her underwear to bad-girl grunge, BRIGITTE FITZGERALD (15) straddles GINGER FITZGERALD (also 15 and in underwear) on one of the twin single beds. Both girls have cigarettes lolling on their lower lips. Both girls have pierced eyebrows, pierced noses and streaked hair. Brigitte has blue nail polish on. Ginger has breasts. \nGINGER Brigitte. Quit dickin' around. Jus' do it. Brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol. Without looking up from her TANK GIRL comic, Ginger hauls her own shirt up to expose her navel. Brigitte swabs Ginger's navel with the wet cotton ball. Her eyes drift to Ginger's chest, then back to what she's doing. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) Ginger's ten months older than me. we're seriously tight. Share everything. Everything. Around them, many candles burn. There's a dead bolt on the door. An attached full bath. The floors are thick with paranormal books. The walls are covered in images of UFO's and horror flicks. A framed photo of Kurt Cobain with Courtney Love has a place of honor. There's an old Polaroid of the girls at five in Halloween costumes; Lill Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. Ginger is the wolf. Brigitte produces an enormous darning needle. It glints. she levels it at Ginger's navel, her hand shaking. \nBR IG ITTE Ready? \nGINGER (without looking up) Uh-huh. \nBRIGITTE .I can't. Ginger gives Brigitte a look over the top of her comic. Brigitte takes a deep breath, and lines the needle up again. Brigitte swallows hard and applies pressure. The needle pierces Ginger's skin. Her stomach muscles flinch. \nGINGER \nOUCH! \nBRIGITTE You said it wouldn't hurt! \nGINGER Jus' hurry up! The needle has stopped moving half-way through the skin. \nBRIGITTE Uh-oh . Brigitte wiggles the needle. Blood wells up around it. \nBRIGITTE Um. I think it's stuck. Oh man. There's blood... Ginger lowers her comic. she takes one look at the needle half-.in, half-out of her belly button - and cracks up. \nBRIGITTE snot funny, Ginger! Laughing her head off, Ginger gives the needle a good tug from her end. The skin tugs with it, resisting. \nBRIGITTE Ali, gawd, gross. Ginger yanks the needle, hard. This time it moves. \nGINGER I got it, I got it. Ginger grits her teeth. The needle begins a slow progress. \nGINGER It's goin', it's goin'- gimme the ring Brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but knocks it to the floor. Brigitte scrambles after it. Ginger yanks the needle. \nGINGER Bee?! C'mon! Brigitte finds the ring and hands it to Ginger. Ginger sets the ring on the end of the needle, looping it not-so-neatly through. \nBRIGITTE Oh, groo-oo-o-ss! The bloody needle pops clear. Ginger grinds on the ring to close it. Ginger wipes her bloody hands on the bed. Brigitte is taking deep, gulping breaths. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) But nobody wanned to reach me. The bell goes. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) (a tad defensive) Like I cared. \nINT. BAILEY HIGH HALLS - DAY \nTEENS clog the halls. Judging by the herd, Bailey High is not big on individual identity, or at least its outward expression. Ginger and Brigitte slip down the crowded corridors, sticking out like sore thumbs. Ginger holds her forehead. \nGINGER Gawd, People! They hurt my brain! \nBRIGITTE They didn't even get it. \nGINGER They're retards. \nBRIGITTE They're cretins. \nGINGER They're bone-heads. \nBRIGITTE 't'hey' re somnambulists. \nGINGER They're leems. \nBRIGITTE They're the goddamn walkin'-/ The girls stop before their locker. A folded up piece of loose leaf has been crushed into it, its end sticking out. \nBR I G ITTE \n(UNIMPRESSED) Another one? Ginger opens the locker. She unfolds the paper. There's a big fat joint inside, and a note that says: GINGER, CALL 555- \nGinger pockets the joint, crumples the paper into a ball and tosses it at a near-by trash can. She misses. The girls head down the hall.. \nBRIGITTE Somebody leaves you all. these jays an, yer not even curious to call? \nGinger offers her a sucker and has one herself. \nGINGER No pe . A FAT JANITOR scoops up the wad of loose leaf with great resentment and jams it into the trash. Brigitte and Ginger pass a NECKING COUPLE practically dry- humping, GIRLS applying make-up to one another, and BOYS snapping each other with their sports cups. Jason and his fellow jock-pals TIM, FRANK, and JEREMY are scoping babes. Ginger bends to tie her boot lace and a collective groan swells from the guys. \nJASON See? She's weird, but hot. \nTIM Anybody poled Fitzy yet? Brigitte gives them a disgusted look. \nTIM Not that one. The cute one. Brigitte's face falls. Ginger gives them a Death Stare. The boys try flirty smiles. \nGINGER (to Brigitte) Sad. Must be hard to think with yer brains slappin' around yer thighs like that all day. Brigitte laughs. Ginger pulls her on, past a sign: GYMNASIUM. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) We didn't do guys. Guys were too gross. Everyone at Bailey High was just too incredibly gross. Ginger applies her boot to a swinging door and they enter, \nINT. GIRLS' CHANGING ROOM - DAY \nThe Fitzgeralds stop dead. They take in a menagerie of 90210- wanna-be GIRLS changing for gym class. The background chat is all sex and mascara. There is only one free spot: next to Trina and her TRINA CLONES. The Trinas slide into a-size-too-small shorts while parading hefty chests. The Trina acts like she owns the goddamn planet. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) The only thing worse than most teenage boys are most teenage girls. Trinas are the limit. Ginger digs at her lower abdomen painfully. \nGINGER I feel sick. \nBRIGITTE Teen cult my ass. Look Ginge', something went for its throat - it's not cut, it's chewed... Brigitte looks up in time to see Ginger's eyes roll back in her head. Ginger faints. The class inhales as one. \nBRIGITTE Ginger? Sykes and the class stampede up. Sykes pushes Brigitte out of the way. \nBRIGITTE (V/0) Ginger's no pussy. She doesn't faint. I might faint. Like, if this pooch were only HALF-dead, I could faint. Brigitte stumbles over the dog carcass. She hugs herself. \nINT. NURSE' S OFFICE -- DAY \nBrigitte sits in her bloodied uniform, chewing her nails. NURSE FERRY - a Mrs. Doubtfi.re-type who chirps more than speaks - is examining Ginger. \nFERRY The fainting' s worrisome you don't diet do you dear? \nGINGER No. \nFERRY Hm. Anemia's very common at your age. Eat more red meat, try an iron vitamin supplement. If it happens again, straight to a proper doctor, all righty? Brigitte looks relieved. \nFERRY Now as for 'the headache, cramps, lower back pain .I'm guessing your period is due. \nGINGER I haven't got a, um, period. \nFERRY Never? Flow old are you? \nGINGER Fifteen. our mother says we're late bloomers. \nFERRY Well judging by your troubles, I'd say you can expect to blossom any time now! Brigitte pulls a face. Ferry produces numerous samples of feminine hygiene products and heaps them onto Ginger. \nFERRY Are you familiar with all these? Ginger shrugs. \nFERRY Now what suits one girl might not be comfortable for another. The proper form of protection is a personal choice, and may have a lot to do with your menstrual flow, which naturally changes during the time you'll have your little miracle of nature. It could start thick and syrupy, move to a straight-forward basic bright red bleeding and then perhaps a deep brownish to blackish slime, signaling the end of the flow. Twenty-eight days later or there abouts, it'll start all over again and continue every month until menopause, in about thirty years' time. Nurse Ferry produces a pocket calendar with a tampon or pad advertisement for every month. \nFERRY (CON'T) Here's a little calendar to keep track, count from the day it starts twenty-eight days. That'll be your next time. You have any questions, come see me again. (to Brigitte) You too sweetheart, be your turn shortly, I expect. Brigitte Looks horrified. \nEXT. A SUBURBAN STREET/TRAVELING - DAY \nBRIGITTE (V/O) Here's a dirty word. Inevitability. That fate fully intended us to be typical in any way, sooner or later, was so insulting. Ginger and Brigitte trudge homeward looking completely depressed. Brigitte flips through the feminine hygiene calendar. Ginger watches the pavement beneath her feet. \nBRIGITTE (reading a panty- liner ad) \"Some days it's all you need.\"-? What does that mean? \nGINGER So you pulled a Quincy on that dog, unh? \nBRIGITTE Hunh? Ginger grabs the calendar and sticks it in her pocket. \nGINGER Quincy, that guy with the stiffs on cable. Alls I remember is you goin', \"Teen cult my ass\". \nBRIGITTE Oh. Right. Well, I dunno. Brigitte shrugs. She gives Ginger a funny look. \nGINGER Why are you looking at me like that? Do I look - different? \nBRIGITTE No. \nGINGER Can you tell I'm going to-? \nBRIGITTE No. .Really. Ginger squints at her, unconvinced. \nPAMELA Henry, neither one of them has had a period yet. \nHENRY Ah. Yes. You've said. Repeatedly. As Pamela says the next line, Ginger mou t:hs it- word for word 1.a Brigitte. \nPAMELA It's very odd that two perfectly healthy fifteen year olds are not menstruating. Right? Briggitte apes Henry's next line back to Ginger. \nHENRY Mmmm. steak's really yummy tonight. This a new sauce? The sisters giggle. Pamela is losing her cool. \nPAMELA I started at eleven. The problem must be on your side, Henry. \nHENRY Pamela? This is not my fault. No one's at fault here. \nPAMELA when did your sister start? \nHENRY I've told you, I really have no idea. Oddly enough, we never discussed it. why don't you call her and ask her yourself? \nPAMELA I can't call her out of the blue and ask a thing like that. Besides, it's dinner time. They'll be eating. \nHENRY A--ha! \nPAMELA Well I've been checking panties for four years now \nGINGER & BRIGITTE/HENRY Mo-othe-er!!! /For chrissakes. \nGINGER (CON'T) You look at our underwear? Fuck! \nHENRY Hey, hey - I don't want to hear that word in my house. You will do as your mother says and I will change the subject. Anybody going to tell me what happened to my fence? From under the table, Henry produces the bloodied, sawed-off picket stained bloody from Ginger's impaling. Brigitte holds her full mouth open so Ginger can see its masticated contents. Ginger cracks up laughing. Henry and Pamela sigh. \nINT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNorman the terrier barks OFF-SCREEN - constantl Brigitte grimaces at the cartoon-style diagrams of How To Insert A Tampon. She carefully unwraps one and sets it in a glass of water. She times its expansion on her watch. \nBRIGITTE Why din't you jus' tell her you're going to get it? \nGinger is dissecting the gift joint from their locker. she sniffs its contents. \nGINGER Can't take her 'attention'. She grosses me out. Can't believe she's our mother. Brigitte puts a fresh tampon up her nose and lifts a Polaroid camera at arms' length from her face. \nBRIGITTE Yeah, but now we have to see this doctor. You can jus' say you got it, but I'm screwed. FLASH! The Polaroid spits out the front. Brigitte sticks another tampon in her free nostril, and one in each ear as, \nGINGER Did I get you out of Home Ec? Did I get you out of ballet classes? So I'll get you out of this, right? \nBR IG ITTE You better, gawd the idea FLASH! Brigitte takes a Polaroid of herself with a tampon sticking out of every visible orifice. Ginger slides the grass into a pre-rolled fresh casing and sticks it in her mouth. \nGINGER I said I will, I will. This jay's fine. Let us smoke, sister. Ginger cranks the stereo and throws on a coat. She double- takes Brigitte' s tampon face. \nGINGER WHAT are you doing? \nBRIGITTE (sticking tampons under her upper lip) Look - a walrus. \nGINGER Hardee-har. Har. \nGinger steps up on the bed and swings the ground-level window open. \nGINGER Nice. Ginger wipes at the blood with her hand. More appears. She lifts up the hem of her skirt. Her face falls. She looks around. She slips her fingers up to her crotch. Her hand comes out bloody. \nGINGER Bee. I JUST got the curse. Brigitte stops rooting garbage over the dog. \nBRIGITTE Serious? Ginger wiggles her wet fingers at her. \nGINGER We gotta go home. \nBRIGITTE Eeew, 'kay. Brigitte catches her kilt on a nail sticking out of a plank in the trash. Something is crunching through the leaves toward them. Ginger peers out into the darkness. \nGINGER Hurry upt \nBRIGITTE I'm stuck3 A few homes down, a garage's motion-sensitive security lamp trips on. Ginger squints, blinded. \nGINGER Bee?: Brigitte contorts to deal with the nail. Brigitte tears her hem free and jumps down. The light snaps off. \nGINGER (indicating the opposite direction) Let's go this way. Brigitte dips a hand back into the dumpster for the plank with the nail. Off Ginger's look, Brigitte shrugs. They start walking down the lane. The greenery behind them starts swelling again. The leaves crunch, faster. Brigitte and Ginger look at one another, and walk faster. The lane empties behind a deserted strip mall. \nEXT. STRIP MALL LOT - NIGHT \nWhatever is behind them knocks an empty trash can over. Brigitte grabs Ginger's arm, scared. \nBRIGITTE This is stupid. We're getting farther from home. Ginger is pissed off now. she turns to confront their stalker. \nGINGER (to the darkness) All right you ass-/ She's cut cold by a roaring blur of speeding fur and teeth and claws: SOMETHING takes Ginger down hard. We cannot see it as a whole, we can't make out what it is. It's big, heavy, and raging. Immense jaws snap vicious teeth, going for Ginger's jugular. Brigitte drops her plank. \nGINGER & BRIGITTE \nBRIGITTE/GINGER!!! Brigitte grabs and kicks at the creature. Ginger raises her arms and covers her head, screeching and kicking. The thing grabs Ginger by the scruff and shakes the living daylights out of her. \nGINGER \nBEEEEEI HELP MEEE! BEEEEE!!!1! Brigitte snatches up the plank with the nails. Brigitte brings it down hard on the thing, screaming. She smacks it once, twice. The plank pops a shot off the camera: FLASH! A horrible set of jaws and one golden eye are caught for a split second in the light. The third hit evokes a yelp and the thing backs off, snarling.. Brigitte quakes with the board raised, ready. The thing skitters before her as she screams. Ginger scrambles to her foot and grabs Bee with bloodied hands. \nGINGER Go-go-go-go-go-go!!!! Brigitte drops the plank and they run like hell.. for a main thorough-way ahead. It pursues them. \nEXT. THE THOROUGH-WAY - NIGHT \nThe late-night traffic is light but consistent. The thing is still, coming. At a dead run Brigitte and Ginger sail between moving cars. The thing burns behind them. The girls are barely missed by an approaching truck. There is a long blast of a horn. Then a sickening thud. Brakes squeal incto a stop as a horrible dragging/ scrain fills the night air. The girls crash to the sidewalk, spilling over top of one another. They glance over their shoulders, even as they disappear into a new residential stretch. The COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM truck sits at a right angle in the road, it's front end smashed. \nSam slowly opens the cab door. He staggers to the bloody grill, clearly shaken. He looks under the truck, and follows a wet trail of gore back behind it to the mangled furry mass about twenty feet back. He takes it in, stunned. Then Sam vomits. \nINT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBrigitte scrambles through the window and helps Ginger through after her. They're bloody, sweaty and tearful. They slump shaking, side by side on Ginger's bed, catching their breath. Brigitte notices the rivulets of blood trickling down Ginger's arms. Ginger's shirt is soaking with growing red stains. \nBRIGITTE Ginger, shit! Ginger looks at herself. Ginger starts to cry. \nGINGER The fuck was that, Bee? \nINT. ATTACHED BATHROOM - NIGHT \nBrigitte flings open the vanity and collects various first aid items: gauze, tape, band-aids, iodine. She snags a washcloth and wets it at the tap. \nGINGER It's gross though. It's really gross. I better, ya know, deal with that... \nBRIGITTE Yeah, sure. Ginger's only half-bandaged up. she staggers to the bathroom and shuts the door. Brigitte eyes the Polaroid camera: a picture sits ready to be dispensed. She pulls it free. We do not see the photo. Brigitte's eyes bug out as she examines it. The toilet flushes in the bathroom and Brigitte pushes the photo under the pillow on her bed. Shaking her head. \nBRIGITTE (V/0) It was blurry. It was really outta focus, so. Ya couldn't TELL it was really anything. Ginger emerges pulling uncomfortably at her crotch. she climbs painfully onto her bed, and collapses. \nGINGER That booze - straight to my head, man. \nBRIGITTE You really okay? Ginger-es eyes are already fluttering shut. \nGINGER You saved me. Love you. Bee. Brigitte leans in, listening to Ginger breathe. \nBRIGITTE Me too, Ginge'. \nGINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15. 1996 30 \nINT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nBrigitte sits straight up in bed, sweating, with eyes wide. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) I woke up later, I thought the thing was in our room. Brigitte peers at Ginger: she's snoring. Brigitte pulls out the Polaroid and fires up her lighter to see by. This time we see it too. A streak of fur, fangs and a golden glinting eye. \nBRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0) Then I remembered Sam the tree planter killed it with his truck, an' we were okay. .But really, Ginger -? well. Wasn't. \nEXT. BAILEY HIGH GROUNDS - DAY \nIt's noon hour. The grounds are full. of teens. Brigitte is eating as she ticks off the fourth day in Ginger's feminine hygiene calendar. Brigit:Le counts 28 days from the first check mark. Her pen hovers over the date: Halloween, arid the next full moon. The first day was a full moon. Brigitte slowly circles them both. Ginger wears long sleeves to hide her bandages, and shades. She's looking BOYS up and down as they pass. Ginger's stomach is growling. An untouched sandwich sits on her lap. \nBRIGITTE Gonna eat that? Ginger shakes her head as she picks at her bandages. Brigitte helps herself. \nBRIGITTE Mmm! Sad, but Pamela's egg salad is her best thing. Like that she can do. (no response) Like, when she puts the baby onions in? (no response) And she gobs on it and adds those hard little pieces of \nBOOGER Ginger pulls at her own crotch. \nBRIGITTE Hell-o 1? \nGINGER Sorry. Pads suck, so ya know. \nBRIGITTE Should eat something. \nGINGER Thanks Pamela, I'm aware. Off Brigitte's insulted look, \nGINGER T dunno, I'm all blaaahh, I got this, like I can taste what I want, but nothin's it. Ya know? Brigitte stops in mid-chew. \nBRIGITTE A craving? \nGINCER Yeah. I crave. Ya know? Brigitte chews very slowly as she stares at Ginger. Ginger squints at Jason and his pals across the yard. \nGINGER McCardy's a stoner right? \nBRIGITTE Yeah -? \nGINGER C'mon, I wanna feel better. \nSAM (to Brigitte) Sorry about him, he's an ass hole. Morely! My girlfriend's, she won't leave him at home alone any more. Ya know, dog killers. Morely, no! Sit! Brigitte's mouth is hanging open. Morely slobbers all over her hands. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) I know, I look like an asshole. Ginger's perma-smug smile fades as she makes eye contact with Morely. Morel growls at her. Sam is about to resume his accident story when, \nJASON Watcha got for us? Sam produces several baggies of grass. Morely's hackles rise. Brigitte looks from the dog to Ginger, Ginger squirms. \nSAM New harvest, see whatcha think. (to Morely) What's your problem? Never seen a pretty girl before? Ginger sneers at Morely and Morely bares his teeth. \nJASON/TIM/FRANK (digging out cash) Thanks, man. Morely bursts out barking and charges at Ginger. Mayhem as the guys try to contain the dog in the small space. Jason uses the opportunity to shield Ginger for a free body press. Brigitte gets banged and shoved. Ginger kicks and screams at the dog, her boot connects squarely with his snout. Morely keels back, and Sam snaps him up. \nSAM Sorry, he's not really like this. I'm really sorry. \nGINGER Jus' get'im out! \nSAM I'm really - well, see you guys. And in another flash of daylight, Sam and Morely are gone. Brigitte looks longingly at the closed door. The stone has set in, and everyone but Brigitte giggles as they settle. Brigitte takes in the Lesser Mortals like they're lepers. \nJASON You okay? \nGINGER Yeah. Just hate dogs. They give one another this corny smile. Brigitte bugs her eyes at Ginger. Ginger rises reluctantly. \nGINGER Well. Thanks for the smoke. \nJASON Maybe we could --/ Ginger places a finger to her lips, then makes a finger gun and shoots him. \nGINGER I'll letcha know. Ginger grins ear-to-ear, elbowing Brigitte. Ginger kicks the van doors open and saunters out. Brigitte :Follows, trying not to laugh. \nINT. SCHOOL CAN - DAY \nBrigitte stands stoned out of her bean in the girls' washroom. She imitates Ginger's cavalier farewell from the last scene. \nBRIGITTE I'll letcha, I'll jus' let-choo know. Bud. .So Ginger. Wanna tell me about you and like, the planet yer currently visiting? No answer. Brigitte squints at the tampon dispenser next to her. She tries to work it without putting money in. She smacks her dry lips. Brigitte bends over the sink and drinks from the tap. \nGINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15, 1996 36 \nGINGER (O/S) Bee-? Brigitte doesn't hear her over the roar of the tap in her face. It shuts off automatically over her gaping mouth. Brigitte puts her finger up the spout and almost gets it stuck. \nGINGER Bee! \nBRIGITTE \n(STARTLED) Yeah! \nGINGER Com'ere-! Brigitte shuffles to the wrong door, opens it and finds it empty. She giggles and moves to the next one. \nBRIGITTE That smoke fucked me _up._ up. Brigitte finds Ginger with her shirt and all, the bandages peeled off. she is dabbing at herself with wads of toilet paper. The scratches and bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo, under which a fine film of dark hairs have sprouted. Brigitte steps into the stall agape. The door hits her on the way in. \nINT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY \nGinger and Brigitte stand nose to nose in the stall. Brigitte has not fully closed the door. Ginger is just as stoned as Brigitte. \nBRIGITTE Geez that's not right. \nGINGER 1 didn't think. \nINT. BIOLOGY LAB - DAY \nToday's assignment is hacking up little pig feti. \nBRIGITTE (O/S) 'Course Trina din't waste any time. Trina stares Brigitte down as she folds up a note and passes it to a classmate. It is read and passed on by every kid in the room during this scene. Brigitte holds her scalpel over the over their piggy - hesitating. Ginger's attention is riveted on the little carcass. \nBRIGITTE They're all looking at us. \nGINGER So? Ginger looks up at Jason, who is reading the note. Jason smiles at Ginger and destroys the note. Trina seethes. Ginger grabs the knife from Brigitte. she makes a deep incision in the pig's belly. \nBRIGITTE So! You're growing fur an, acting like a nut, is so! Ginger spies two girls giggling at her. Using both hands Ginger cracks the carcass. wide open like a clam. Ginger digs in, gouging out the pig's parts with her bare hands. Ginger breaks into a sweat, her breathing gets heavy. Brigitte cautiously looks around at their classmates. she moves to shield Ginger from prying eyes. \nBRIGITTE Um. Ginger-? \nGINGER hold on, I'm goi.n' for the brain. Ginger has begun scraping away at the pig's cranium with her finger nails. A sickening creak, snap, and the brain is exposed. Ginger - unconsciously - licks her fingers as she admires its frontal lobe. \nBrigitte fights a ralph. \nBRIGITTE Can't believe you did that! \nGINGER Hunh? What? Before Brigitte can answer, Ginger lifts the brain out on her finger tips, gently pushes Brigitte out of her way and... Whap! The brain lands squarely on Trina's head. Trina screams. \nGINGER Ha-ha! Bull's eye! \nBIO TEACHER Ginger Fitzgerald! Hall, NOW! \nGINGER What, it slipped! As Ginger stomps out with the teacher. Brigitte and Trina gape at one another. \nINT. GYNECOLOGIST'S EXAMINING ROOM - DAY \nBRIGITTE (V/O) That week, Ginger was all over the map. She was the goddamn schizo poster girl. She forgot the gyno guy. I couldn't believe she forgot. She promised. Brigitte is dying a thousand deaths on the examining table with her feet in stirrups. The GYNECOLOGIST is examining her. A NURSE stands next to him, smiling benignly as she passes him the contraption used to take a pap smear. Brigitte is almost in tears. \nCUT TO: Same moment in the examination procedure, but now Ginger is in the stirrups. And the doctor is shocked at his findings. \nGYNO What the -? \nINT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nBrigitte gives Ginger a pout as they both shift uncomfortably in their seats. The doctor is gulping cups of water from the water cooler, his hand shaking. He talks to Pamela like the girls aren't even there. \nGYNO I've never seen anything like it. She's not built like a normal girl. I've sent samples to the lab. But this is very, VERY unusual. Brigitte pokes Ginger in the ribs. Ginger doesn't like this, and pushes Brigitte so hard she almost falls off her chair. \nPAMELA Girls, please. \nINT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT The window is open. Norman the terrier yams. Ginger is in a tank shirt which reveals her hair growth is spreading. Brigitte is sitting at. the desk with a pile of monster books. \nGINGER What're you, nuts? I got a skin thing, whatever. \nBRIGITTE If you just gotta skin thing why does it get worse everytime yer being a bitch? Why's the gyno say you're a monster inside? \nGINGER He din't say that! \nBR I G ITTE Just listen to these symptoms! \nPAMELA (O/S) Who's showering so late? \nBRIGITTE Ginger! \nPAMELA(O/S) Why? \nBRIGITTE she's dirty?! Brigitte throws up her hands: what an idiotic conversation. \nPAMELA (01S) Dirty!? How'd she get/ \nBR IG ITTE I'm tryin' to study, here! \nPAMELA (01S) oh, all right then. Brigitte slumps against the door. The showers stops. Ginger appears in a towel, pink and clean and freshly furry in places. She's in a really good mood. She takes one look at Brigitte's face of doom and tries to be serious. \nGINGER I couldn't help it. Really. Guess you were right. Ginger finds and lights a smoke. \nGINGER You know what's really weird? \nBRIGITTE Weirder than KILLING A DOG AND \nEATING IT???!! \nGINGER I liked it. I liked it a lot. I feel all fucki.n' goofy now. Like, I dunno. Like .happy? Brigitte shakes her head over and over. \nGINGER I feel like I just got off the Planet Smasher ride at WarWorid, okay? It rules! Ginger leaps to the stereo and blasts on some tunes. She flails around the room wildly. Ginger grabs Brigitte by the arms and makes her dance too. Ginger spins and spins Brigitte, who fights it but laughs. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) So she'd killed Norman. 1 never seen anyone bliss out like that. I wanted to be so blissed, jus' once. There is repeated pounding on their door. Brigitte still entangled in Ginger, hits the music off. \nPAMELA (O/S) Little late for that, girls. \nGINGER/BRIGITTE (Bite me:)/Sorry; They stand in each other's arms listening to Pamela mount the stairs OFF SCREEN. Ginger shoves Brigitte backward onto her bed. Ginger piles on top of her, playfully pinning her down. \nGINGER I want more. Brigitte squirms fitfully. \nBR IG ITTE No, it's too gross! You'll get caught. \nGINGER Not if you help. Bee. I'm starving. Brigitte looks into her sister's beaming face. \nGINGER Jus' keep watch. Look, I'm gonna be somethin' totally else. Tell me you don't so dig it. Tell me you don't wanna see what happens. Brigitte groans. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) Straight up? Crazy's contagious. Trust me. \nEXT. VARIOUS STREETS & YARDS - VARIOUS NIGHTS \nBailey Downs sleeps soundly as the hunt begins. The moon is a sliver of its former self. Ginger cocks her head at the sound of a dog barking. She lifts her nose into the wind and sniffs. Ginger is prowls like a wild cat through yards and service lanes, as A study in much less stealth, Brigitte stumbles, trips and slips after Ginger. Splits her sweats climbing fences. Loses a shoe over garage roofs, gets caught in automated lawn sprinklers, falls into hidden cellar window troughs, as A series of dogs perk their ears and snarl from their dog houses, chains, and porch perches... Low whistles and smoochy sounds lure the dogs into bushes, behind cars, around fences. Strings of dogs' chains strain tight, then slacken... Ginger - wild-eyed, bloody-mouthed, and euphoric - tosses collars at Brigitte. Brigitte misses most of the tosses. She picks up the collars and fingers these souvenirs with disgust. \nINSERT: \nEXT. A BACK YARD - DAWN \nA LITTLE KID decked out for hockey practice waddles into his yard with a full dog food dish. His feet squish along his pet's entrails. He finds his dog's body and drops the dish with a clatter on the cement patio. \nKID M-m-mMOMI? \nGINGER Got a light, Jace'? Jason and his pals all fumble for lighters and five little flames appear before her smoke. She lights her smoke on Jason's, and exhaling looks him up and down. The boys flames go out, all at once. \nGINGER My sister would like one also. obediently, they all light up for Brigitte. Brigitte falters before the attention. At Ginger's nod, Brigitte lights up too. \nTRINA (O1S) Slut. Ginger turns to see Trina and the Clones sizing her up. \nGINGER Excuse me? Ginger seems to tower over the Trinas today. Trina can't match the menace. Ginger exhales smoke in Trinals face and climbs the steps into the school. Brigitte double-takes Ginger's back. Ginger's spine is protruding sharply through her shirt. Trina leers at Brigitte. \nTRINA Better watch your back, Fitzenstein. Brigitte snorts and follows Ginger in. \nBRIGITTE (under her breath) Like I'm scared. \nINT ENGLISH CLASS - DAY Ginger chews her nails like a dog does when cleaning them. Brigitte and the rest of the class watch an RCMP OFFICER holding a reward poster at the front of the room. \nOFFICER we need your cooperation. If you know anything about the so- called Beast of Bailey Downs, call in. You can be anonymous. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) Ha! As if they weren't already. \nOFFICER (CON'T) But your pets aren't safe until the perpetrator is caught. Ginger sighs loudly and Brigitte prods her. \nEXT. BAILEY HIGH SPORTING FIELD - DAY \nThe girls' gym class is prepping for lacrosse again. The Trinas square off across the half-way mark from Ginger. Mz. Sykes blows her whistle. The scrimmage begins. Trina whips the Indian rubber ball right into Ginger's face. Ginger drops her stick and launches herself at Trina. Play stops with the whistle, but Ginger and Trina are just going at it. Ginger's winning. Trina bites Ginger's sore arm and Ginger rakes her nails over Trina's neck.. Ginger draws blood. Mz. Sykes breaks it up by dragging Ginger off Trina. Sykes tends to Triria, who bawls. Ginger wipes her bloody hand over her mouth. \nBRIGITTE Ginger! Ginger's rolling the taste of Trina's blood around in her mouth. \nGINGER Mmnun . \nBRIGITTE You can't do that, That's human blood! .Feel anything? Brigitte and Ginger stare at one another. Ginger first shakes her head., but then nods. Ginger looks around and whispers \nGINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15, 1996 52 \nGINGER It's sick but - I'm all like horny. Brigitte makes a sour face. \nSYKES Fitzgerald, bench! \nGINGER What, she started it! Brigitte watches Ginger march to the sidelines, throwing off her gear as she goes. \nSYKES Pick that stuff up! Ginger gives Sykes the finger without looking back. Brigitte groans. \nINT. BAILEY HIGH HALLS - DAY \nBrigitte waits outside a door marked GUIDANCE. Trina struggles by with the help of her clones. Trina sports a big ugly bandage on her neck, knees and an arm in a sling. She shoots Brigitte a Death Stare. \nTRINA Yer bitch sister's dead, freak. \nBRIGITTE (under her breath) Fuck off. Jason lopes up. He indicates the guidance office door. \nJASON Ginger in there again? Brigitte ignores him. \nJASON Cool. Um. Look, Belinda... \nBRIGITTE Brigitte. \nBRIGITTE My life is basically over. \nGINGER Bee. ..BEE! Awestruck, they both watch as Ginger extends and retracts her: new set of claws. There is a knock at the door. The girls look at one another in mute horror. Ginger addresses the door. \nGINGER What! \nPAMELA (O/S) Are you two fighting?! \nGINGER -- No! \nGINGER SNAPS -WALTON/July 15. 1996 61 \nPAMELA (O/S) come on then. Dinner's ready. Brigitte and Ginger hop up and down in a brief freak fit. \nGINGER (O/S) Coming! \nTNT FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - NIGHT Ginger has her new paw curled up in an over-sized sweat jacket sleeve. Brigitte stares at the stew before them with grave distaste. Pamela has a number of used tissues around her - she's been crying. \nHENRY The gynecologist called. Pamela grasps Ginger's gnarly arm and squeezes it through her sleeve. Brigitte and Ginger look at Pamela's hand. \nPAMELA There's something wrong, Ginger. He wants to do an ultra-sound! \nHENRY Pamela, don't scare her. How could the cells not be human cells? we'll send you to somebody else. \nPAMELA I'm sure your father's right. I'm just upset... How are you feeling, do you feel. all right? \nGINGER Um. sure. Fine. \nPAMELA (lowering her voice) No unusual discharge or anything like that? Henry, Brigitte and Ginger groan. \nPAMELA I worry, all right? I've made another appointment with a new doctor. Early next month was the earliest he could see you. okay? \nGINGER okay. They all begin eating in silence. Except Brigitte who gags as Henry squirts ketchup all over his stew. \nEXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT \nTrina's body is wrapped in a bedspread and stuffed in a kid's wagon. Brigitte is keeping a look out looking pale and sickened. Grass and dirt spray out of the playhouse. Ginger is digging up the ground inside doggie style. She emerges, shaking the turf out of her new paw. They struggle to get Trina inside, but she's already too stiff to bend up. \nGINGER Told you. \nBRIGITTE Rigor mortis. Knew we shoulda skipped dinner. \nGINGER Can we do it my way now? Brigitte hesitates, her anxieties rising. \nBR IG ITTE So is this it? You doin' people now? \nGINGER She won't fit unless I \nBR IG ITTE You know what I mean. Just say. \nGINGER I din't kill her! \nBRIGITTE But were you gonna? There is a long pause.

I don't know where she is, I'm very concerned. That's it, unless you got a warrant. She ends up backing into a COP behind some palms. \nBRIGITTE Shhh-it! I mean, sorry. \nSAM (to cop) You can see I got customers, so if that's all. \nCOP Okay. Sure. For now. The cop gives Sam a final Dirty Harry squint and leaves. Sam collects himself with difficulty.

What do you need. \nBRIGITTE Um. Lookin' for this. She holds out the torn page. Sam takes it. \nSAM Aconitum lycoctonum? Sorry. Brigitte yanks her own hair hard.

Doesn't matter. \nSAM Anyways they're perennials - only flowers in spring. Brigitte turns to leave, hot with frustration, huinilliation. Sam watches her stamp toward the door. \nSAM Hey. Ranunculaceae come in about a hundred species. I've gotta cousin, monkshood. Not so toxic. If you're interested. \nBrigitte stops and considers him. \nSAM Don't know if it'd help. \nINT GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER They sit together amidst beautiful plants and flowers. Sam. picks a tiny purple flower from a bed of young plants and hands it to Brigitte. \nSAM S'called monkshood 'cause people used to think it kept 'em pure from dirty thoughts. Seriously. \nWAYNE (cutting her off) You are expelled. This is not your personal playground, this is a school. \nGINGER Oh dear. \nINT. GUIDANCE OFFICE -- A FEW MINUTES LATER/DAY \nGinger's good hand lifts the telephone receiver on Mr. Wayne's desk. With her wolfen paw she dials. In the background we see blood splattered over the walls. \nGINGER (O/S) (imitating Pamela) Hello, main office? This is Mrs. Fitzgerald. would you page my daughter Brigitte please? I'm waiting to meet her in the guidance office. Thank you so much. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nBrigitte catches herself writing Sam's name on her binder.

GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY \nGINGER Don't ever fuck with me like that again. \nBRIGITTE You .got out. Brigitte gapes at all the blood. Ginger is very agitated. \nGINGER He asked for it. Was gonna expel me. So. Backing away, Brigitte trips over Mr. Wayne's foot sticking out from under the desk. \nGINGER What do we do, Bee? What do we do? \nBrigitte sinks into a chair looking completely traumatized. Ginger hops about - charged by the kill. \nGINGER C'mon we need a fuckin' plan here! The school bell goes off. Brigitte snaps out of her daze, reaches up and hits the light switch off. They now sit in virtual darkness. \nBRIGITTE Last bell. wait till everyone goes. We'll stuff him someplace. Clean this up. I guess. The sound of the full halls around them seems very loud now. \nGINGER Bee, gotta a smoke? Brigitte hands her a smoke. \nGINGER Sorry about this. \nBRIGITTE Whatever. \nGINGER Don't be mad, ' kay? \nBRIGITTE I'm not mad. \nINT. BAILEY HIGH HALLS - LATER \nThe school is deserted. The lock pops on the Guidance door and Brigitte and Ginger peer out. Nobody. \nBRIGITTE Stay here. Lock the door. I'll knock once. Ginger nods. Brigitte slips out and creeps down the corridor. Ginger shuts the door. Then Ginger whips it open again. \nBR IG ITTE Shut the door, Ginger! \nJASON Well, well well.. \nGINGER SNAPS -WALTON/Jufy 15, 1996 76 Jason and his pals climb out of the van.

He extends his hand to shake on it. Linger shakes it awkwardly with her good hand. Brigitte thumps her head against the wall. \nINT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGinger leans on the bathroom door, which is shut. \nEXT SERVICE LANE - NIGHT Brigitte trudges up to the bus stop next to the fence of the playhouse yard with her full Adidas bag. Light streams from inside the yard, multi-coloured, strobing. It looks like a UFO has landed on the other side of the fence. She peers through the slats. She sees the playhouse, lit up like a Christmas tree. She sees gloved hands and police uniforms. Then sliding past, the long - almost endless - shape on a stretcher being drawn out of the playhouse: they've found Trina's body. The bus appears, approaching from way down the road. \nBrigitte looks from it to the crime scene. The crime scene photographer's FLASH! pops in Brigitte's face - blinding her for a second. Brigitte rubs her eyes. She shakes her head hard. The bus is indicating, slowing to pull over. Brigitte opens her eyes. The bus is almost here. Brigitte grips her Adidas bag. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) But you can't break up with blood. You can't divorce yer sister. You jus' can't. The bus passes, obscuring Brigitte from view as its body fills frame. when its tail lights pass, Brigitte is far down the street, running like a champion in the direction she came from. \nINT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBrigitte carefully unlocks the bedroom door and slowly opens it. The room is dark and just as she left it. Ginger's hed has not been slept in, and she is no where to be seen. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) I'd get the monkshood from my locker at school the next morning. Brigitte creeps to the bathroom and snaps the light on. Empty. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) I'd find Ginger, I'd find out if the stuff even worked. Brigitte locks the window shut. She locks the bedroom door and pushes a bureau of drawers in front of it. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) I could deal with whatever, as long as I tried. If it was the last thing she ever saw me do, it was gonna be me goin' fer somethin' by myself. The real Ginger woulda dug that large. Brigitte turns on the bedside lamp and fishes a baseball bat out of the closet. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) I would try to save my sister when the sun came up. You know, if the sun came up. Brigitte climbs into bed, snuggling the bat in with her. She lights a smoke. She finds the feminine hygiene calendar on the bedside table next to the photo of the girls as kids at Halloween, taken many years before. The calendar tells us it is about to be Friday. Friday is the full moon. Friday is Halloween. \nINT GIRLS' ROOM - DAWN The lamp is still on. The ash tray is full of butts. Brigitte stirs in her sleep. Ginger stands at the end of Brigitte's bed, staring at her. Brigitte snaps to, gripping the bat. Ginger snorts, and climbs into her own bed. Brigitte swings her gaze to the window. It is still shut and locked. The bureau is still in front of the door. Brigitte holds her hat tightly and watches her sister's back in the next bed, terrified. \nEXT. BAILEY HIGH - DAY \nBrigitte jogs up to the school. The yard is full of students. Teachers are marshaling them into lines and seating them on the grass. Brigitte plows through. Ginger rides past, piggy-backed by Jason. Ginger completely ignores Brigitte. Brigitte looks very worried. \nFEMALE STUDENTS Ginger Fitzgerald is such a slut./No kidding./The bitch. \nVARIOUS STUDENTS You hear about Trina Sinclair?/Dug her up in somebody's back yard!/oh that's so sad!/ Poor Trina, Ga-awd! As Brigitte gets closer to the building, she finds police cars and cops at the main entrance. \nBRIGITTE Shit. PRINCIPAL FARDOR is speaking with the RCMP constable who has been visiting classes. Fardor holds a hanky over his face. \nFARDOR That stench near the staff offices, what is that you think? Brigitte hedges up the steps toward the door. \nOFFICER I couldn't say, sir. Now is there anyone you suggest we talk to? Anyone with something against the school? Brigitte slips past the two men. \nFARDOR For god's sake look around you. I got 350 angry young people bored blind.Helluva day for my goddamn cleaning staff to be late ... . IIEY! Brigitte stops at the threshold. \nFARDOR The hell you goin'? \nBR IG ITTE I left something in my locker. \nFARDOR Find your homeroom and wait. School's outta bounds until we call you in. Get! Brigitte backs down the steps, looking like she just took a good slap. She turns to confront the mass confusion around her. Brigitte spots Ginger dancing on the roof of a car in the lot now, surrounded by boys. Brigitte spots Sam's truck near-by. \nEXT. BAILEY HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY \nSam is sit in his truck, slumped over the wheel. He holds an almost-gone bottle of rye. Brigitte runs up. \nSam is crying. He doesn't see Brigitte arrive at his window, so she turns to tip-toe away. Sam looks up. His eyes tell us he's stoned. \nSAM Hey. Wolfs bane. Wanna drink? Brigitte stops and turns to face him. Sam dries his face on his sleeve and pops his passenger door. Brigitte looks around and slides in. Ginger is watching Brigitte out of the corner of her eye. \nINT. SAM'S TRUCK - DAY \nSAM I showed up to see Trina? But she's I'm goin' strange in the head. Brigitte doesn't know what to say, so she offers his a smoke. He takes it. \nGINGER SNAPS -WALTON/July 15. 1996 \nBOYS Sure, everybody knows! Can I bring my cousin? \nINT.

Can I come to yer party too? \nBRIGITTE sh-sure. Sorry. I gotta - Ginger, so. Brigitte slips out of the truck as they stare at one another with that look you get when you're scared because you just kissed someone you really, really like. \nEXT. BAILEY HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY \nTwo more squad cars are gliding up the street toward the school. .Brigitte makes her way toward Ginger. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) fie was jus' drunk, I'm thinkin'. I mean he prob'ly din't mean it. Whatever. Beyond Sam's truck, behind Brigitte, the two new cruisers lurch to a stop. Cops approach Sam's vehicle with extreme caution. Brigitte arrives at the car with Ginger as, \nGINGER All a' you guys?! My house! Tonight! (very sinister) I wanna party with everybody. we'll do it till you drop. \nCROWD \nALL RIGHT, GINGER:::! WHO00- \nHOO! The crowd applauds. Brigitte stares at Ginger like she's watching a cruise missile coming in. Ginger notices Brigitte watching her. Ginger pretends she doesn't see her. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) Ginger was gonna kill every one of l em. A commotion behind them causes everyone to turn. Sam is being dragged from his truck by the cops. He is flung face-first onto the hood and hand-cuffed. \nCOP Sam McDonald? You're under arrest for the murder of Trina Sinclair. Brigitte physically fights with herself not to yell out. She runs a few steps toward Sam. Brigitte looks back at Ginger, who drills her with an evil warning glare. The cops shove Sam into the back of a cruiser. They roar off. Brigitte stands alone, apart from the crowd. The cruisers' flashing lights disappear down the street. Brigitte turns to face Ginger, mustering her own first menacing look. Ginger accepts a cigarette offered by one of her boys. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) They closed the school that day. So I never got to my locker. So I never got the monkshood. I thought, this is it. I fucked up. \nEXT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - LATE DAY \nThe full moon is just making an appearance. Brigitte stands in the front room window, which is decorated with a Happy Halloween paper sign and plastic bats. Brigitte's watching Henry put Styrofoam tombstones in the front yard. \nINT. FTTZGERALD DINING ROOM - LATE DAY \nThe Fitzgerald family is eating. Brigitte pokes at her food. Ginger eats like a fiend, with sunglasses on. Her monster arm has been wrapped in gauze from tip to elbow. \nPAMELA Now just remember, no boys in you bedroom during this party. Your room is off limits. Ginger are you sure that arm's not sprained, or worse? \nGINGER Bruise. Lacrosse. \nPAMELA Mm Henry when'd you get this new meat from Tinny's? Quite nice. Brigitte and Ginger exchange a look. \nHENRY I haven't been to Tinny's. \nPAMELA Then where's all the packs marked \"t\" come from -?

Brigitte smiles, embarrassed and freaking at the exact same time. \nSAM Be right back. \nGINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15. 1996 98 Across the densely crowded room, Sam whispers in Ginger's ear. Ginger smiles and nods and palms something he passes her. Ginger glances at Brigitte, who tries to pretend she's not watching. when Brigitte checks again, Ginger is leading Sam by the hand toward her bedroom. Sam looks over his shoulder and lifts a finger - one second - back at Brigitte. The bedroom door shuts behind them. Brigitte leaps toward the bedroom. Someone catches her arm and holds her back. \nPAMELA one minute young lady, I could use a little help here. \nBR I G ITTE Let go of me, I have to get Ginger! \nPAMELA I have to get two more veggie trays down those stairs. I think your sister' 11 be fine for two minutes. Pamela is already marching Brigitte up the stairs. Brigitte strains to get back. Looking between her mother and her closed bedroom door, desperately. \nINT. FITZGERALD BASEMENT PROPER - MINUTES LATER \nPamela snags Brigitte again as Brigitte dumps the veggie tray and tries to get to the bedroom. \nPAMELA All these boys came to see you two, least you can do is stop hiding in your room. Honestly, you act like someone'd forced this party down your throat. Now go be nice. Pamela stands between Brigitte and the bedroom door, her arms folded. \nBRIGITTE Mother. You don't understand. \nPAMELA Yes--I do. I was shy too at your age. Mingle. \nBrigitte backs away with such a dirty look on her face. She turns to confront the eager painted faces around her - all desperate for some female attention. Brigitte has I want to scream written all over her face. \nINT. GIRLS BEDROOM - MEANWHILE/NIGHT \nSam pushes Ginger away from him. Ginger has Brigitte's gift joint smoldering between her finger tips. Ginger is pretty out of it, she totters. \nSAM okay, cut it out now. \nGINGER This dope's fucked. Makin' me blaarrggh. C'mon. I'll do ya. \nSAM No thanks.

Jason and Brigitte's faces darken simultaneously. \nBRIGITTE Ginger, we should get home. \nGINGER No we shouldn't. Brigitte drags Ginger aside. Ginger notes Brigitte's hand squeezing her arm with a dangerous look. \nBRIGITTE Twenty minutes ago you coulda killed somebody. Is this really a good time to start dating? I don't think so. Ginger shakes Brigitte's hand off. \nGINGER Well, I do. \nBRIGITTE Why? \nGINGER Why?! Look, grow up a little an' maybe you'll get it \nBRIGITTE What. \nGINGER Forget it, I'm goin'.

Well, he rammed iue with this beam, right in my stomach. Accidentally. Brigitte wanders over the emptying school. lot. She looks small and alone. She looks disoriented. \nBRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0) But all the air came outta my lungs at once an, I kept tryin' to breathe but I couldn't. I forgot all about that. Till like right now.

PARK AREA - NIGHT \nTrina wears a radio headset that pounds post-disco dance mix as she jogs. Morely dashes in and out of the surrounding greenery. He dashes in once more, and does not reappear. Trina looks back expectantly. She runs in place, waiting for him. She heads back, looking for him. Ginger pops out of the brush before Trina. Gingers face smeared with blood from Mo.rely. Ginger grins insanely. Ginger wiggles Morely's collar. Trina clicks off her head set. \nGINGER Hi! \nINT FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - NIGHT Brigitte descends the stairs to her room. Music blasts from the basement. \nPAMELA (O/S) Brigitte? Tell your sister to turn that stereo down! \nINT. GIRLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nBrigitte lets herself in. The music is now deafening. Trina is bound in a chair at the end of her bed, screaming her head off. Her screams are buried by the music. Brigitte slams and locks the door behind her. \nGINGER (yelling over noise) Stop screaming or I'll rip your permed head right off you neck. An' ya know what? I can do that. Now open wide Ginger force-feeds Trina something on a spoon. Trina screams with her mouth full, trying to spit it back out. Ginger offers Trina a glass of milk. \nGINGER Chaser? No? \nGINGER SNAPS-WALTON/July 15, 1996 59 Blood trickles out of the corners of Trinas mouth as she chews while bawling.

Will tell on you! This is someone who will tell! Trina throws herself forward again and her toes connect firmly with the floor - just as her temple connects with a sickening CRACK on the sharp corner of the desk. The milk glass dumps on top of her. \nBrigitte and Ginger look at her. Trina hangs there in the chair at this strange angle for a moment, dripping milk. Then Trina and the chair keel to the floor. Trina is still. Brigitte turns the music off and creeps up to Trina. Blood trickles out of Trina's ear and swirls into the milky glass mess at her mouth. Her open eyes stare at nothing. She's dead. \nGINGER Ha-ha. Ginger grabs her own right arm (most damaged by the original attack) and shudders with pain. \nGINGER Ow. Ow. Owchee-wow-ow. Brigitte takes Trina in from head to toe.

Ginger takes a deep breath before she opens the bathroom door. Her breath is ragged. She smoothes her hair and chews her lip. She's nervous.

GIRLS' BATHROOM - MEANWHILE/NIGHT \nBrigitte - now in ZOMBIE-face - rubs the monkshood between her fingers, crumbling it into a neat pile on the counter. OFF-SCREEN from the bedroom, the sounds of Ginger having rough sex continue.

GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT \nOn the counter at the sink, all evidence of Brigitte's project with the monkshood are gone. Brigitte peers out the cracked door and then looks away, fighting an urge to watch in spite of being grossed out. The sounds of sex drift in from the bedroom. She catches sight of herself in the mirror. As a ZOMBIE. She tugs her shirt tight over her breasts. Nothing to see. She smoothes her shirt with her hands, then moves her palms down over her waist, her hips. Over her crotch. Brigitte's fingers skip under her skirt. Brigitte's face tells us she's searching for something under there. She's trying this out. But nothing's happening. She frowns. She draws her hands out of her skirt and quickly washes her hands in the sink. She checks her watch and sighs. \nINT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBrigitte creeps out of the bathroom on all fours.

You're not being very sociable... There's no answer. She tries the knob, and is surprised to find it unlocked. She opens the door. She turns on the lights. Pamela takes in the bloody muck everywhere. The room is deserted. No Sam. No sisters Fitzgerald. Just gore. Pamela swoons and drops like a deadweight to the floor. Henry rushes up, looking in over his wife's body. The boys in costume crowd in behind him. \nHENRY Pamela, honey, it's just a prank, you know how they... (he fingers some \nGORE) Holy mother of - it's warm.

TRUCK - NIGHT \nBrigitte (still a zombie) throws the truck into gear with an amateur's hand. Her Adidas bag and her jar of two dollar bills is on the seat next to her. Ginger is just seen through the grate between the cab and the dark back of the truck. \nBRIGITTE (V/O) Plans, plans arc good. 'Course I hardly had one. Adrenaline though, adrenaline is pretty speedy shit. \nBRIGITTE Ginger?! Don't eat the body okay? I got this idea, an' we'll need Sam.

Heading back to the Fitzgerald house. \nBRIGITTE Ha! All rightie then. Brigitte drives on. What she cannot see behind her in the grate are the glimpses of Ginger in the flickering lights of the passing street lamps. Her final spurt of transformation is taking place: FLASH! Her face is filling in with fur. FLASH! Her eyes glow golden, yellow, wolfen. FLASH! Her face pulls into a wet snout. FLASH! A long pink tongue lolls out between glistening white fangs. \nEXT. THE HILLCREST - NIGHT \nThe truck rolls to the crest of the hill over Bailey Downs - the sight of the bush party. The moon is immense up here. You could almost touch it. \n", "test3_true": "Brigitte eases the truck to the edge of the hill. The lights of the homes below them creep into view. \nBRIGITTE okay, Ginger? They'll think that Sam took us from our room, right? 'Cause of his record an, the arrest, right? We're gonna make this look like he did, any ways.

Brigitte climbs up into the truck, reaching for something on its floor. Brigitte f itids Sam's prone feet. An animal/Ginger launches out at her, knocking her back, out, clear of the truck. Ginger isn't Ginger any more - what we can glimpse in the darkness is an attack by a creature much like the one that bit Ginger. And it's attacking Brigitte. Brigitte flails, kicks and punches at it. She breaks free and clambers at the tool rack on the inside panel of the truck. She grabs a shovel as the creature comes snarling up at her. \nBRIGITTE Stop. I mean it. It lunges at her again and Brigitte clocks it. It slides, dazed, off the back of the truck to the ground. \nJUMP TO: Brigitte drags Sam's body into the front seat. She sets her Adidas bag on the gas pedal. She releases the brake. The truck rolls forward. off the top of the hill. Brigitte watches as it crashes down, down, rolling and twisting into the suburb below. It lands in a heap and bursts into flames. \nBRIGITTE Nice one. Brigitte returns to where It/Ginger was last seen on the ground. The shovel and blanket are there. A bloody pool trails off into the woods. Brigitte hefts the shovel warily, shoulders the blanket, and follows the wetness shining in the moonlight. \nINT. TREES/HILLCREST - NIGHT \nBRIGITTE Fuck Ginger. Leave a fuckin' trail much? Could leave everybody a fuckin' map... Tense seconds pass as she searches through the scrub and trees, shovel ready. we can hear panting and growling. \nBRIGITTE I won't hurt you if you don't hurt me. 'Kay? Ginge'? 'Kay? Brigitte spots something ahead and lowers the shovel as she approaches it. It/Ginger cowers in the brush, collapsed. Her head and tail are bleeding. Brigitte drops to her knees nest to her sister, frantic with grief. \nBRIGITTE Oh no. Ginger. I didn't mean \nTO It/Ginger is gasping, fading. Her eyes start rolling back in her head. Brigitte's hand is shaking as it reaches out but can't touch her. Ginger licks Brigitte's fingers, slowly. Brigitte buries her face in Ginger's ruff, moaning. \nBRIGITTE You can't, you can't, we're out. You can't, don't don't do this to me. Not now. Look, look it's all taken care of. we're Unsolved Mysteries! \nEXT. A HIGHWAY - PRE-DAWN \nThe sunrise has the sky this bloody red. \nBrigitte drags Ginger a few feet past a sign next to the road: THANK YOU FOR VISITING BAILEY DOWNS! \nBRIGITTE (V/O) We made it out. There was this road? An' the space between here and where ever. I did it. Brigitte opens the blanket. Ginger has returned to human form. Because Ginger is dead. \nEXT. A HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING \nIn a small grove of trees, Brigitte pushes the last pile of dirt over Ginger's shallow grave. Brigitte wipes her caked hands off in the dewy grass. Beneath the dirt and dried blood, she finds puncture wounds. BITES. Brigitte looks TO CAMERA. She rolls her eyes wearily. Brigitte stands and heads to the side of the road. A semi appears on the horizon, coming her way. Brigitte lifts her thumb. The semi's turn indicator comes on as it slows and veers to arrive before her. ROLL TAIL CREDITS as: Excerpts from an episode of the television program UNSOLVED MYSTERIES roll. It tells the story of the mysterious disappearance of two teenage girls - sisters - who disappeared under strange circumstances in the normally quiet suburb of Bailey Downs. Brigitte and Ginger LOOK-A-LIKES re-enact the summarized events of their flight from justice. The cops figured out their faked deaths, of course.. Henry and Pamela have reportedly denied comment. It is seen from the community's perspective as two delusional young women gone totally wrong, a grotesque tragedy of youth wasted by mental illness. No one can explain though the non-human blood trails leaving the scene of their last crime... At the segment's close and the credits roll. out, we see the traditional high school photos of Brigitte and Ginger. \nVOICE OF UNSOLVED MYSTERIES Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald are considered armed and dangerous. If you see these two young women, or have any information on their whereabouts, please contact Crimestoppers, or your local detachment of the RCMP.

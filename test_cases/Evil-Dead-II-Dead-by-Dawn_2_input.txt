CAMERA MOVING swiftly down a dark tunnel. A light at the end growing closer. The SOUND of AIR RUSHING BY. The Delta 88 Oldsmobile comes ROARING out of the tunnel with a BLAST of AIR, and the sound of loud rock and roll music. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) It was one week later that a group of college students came to the cabin. 
14A   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT                    14A 
The Delta 88 Oldsmobile parked out front.  Fog roars past the place.  We faintly hear waltz music from within.  The silhouette of a woman sweeps by the rear bedroom window. 
14B   INT. CABIN - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT                     14B ASH AND LINDA 
LINDA, an attractive college student, is waltzing in the semi darkness of the bedroom.  She wears a "Michigan State University" sweatshirt.  She hums melodically to the music as she moves.  Around her neck is draped a delicate silver necklace. 
14C   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14C 
A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music on an old wooden piano.  Linda dances behind him.  Ash is not a very good pianist, and can only plunk out the melody with two fingers. 
LINDA Ash, what's that you're playing? 
ASH Our song. 
Ash begins to play faster. 
14D   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14D

14E   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    14E 
Out of breath, hair tousled across her eyes, she stares deeply into Ash's eyes.  Her lips, parted, in a sensual manner. 
14F   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      14F 
He returns her stare, lost in her beauty.  He pulls her close. 
LINDA Ow! 
14G   SHE PULLS AWAY SUDDENLY                               14G 
And looks down to the tiny silver necklace that she wears about her neck. 
14H   CLOSE SHOT - NECKLACE                                 14H 
In its center is a magnifying glass.

She looks from the necklace to Ash. 
LINDA I really love it.  I'll never take it off. 
They kiss and now begin to dance together, to the haunting waltz melody that sweeps up upon the soundtrack.

The cabin is in the distance.  In the foreground the earth begins to swell, then rips apart as a red glow emanates from beneath.  Something evil is being unleashed. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) One by one, they fell to the possession of the dark spirits.

SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
EXT. PRISON CEMETERY -- DAY 
A handful of people are gathered in an open field under a fierce Mississippi sun. A couple of young inmates, JAKE and LEON, lean on their shovels. They are waiting to bury two identical CASKETS with inmate numbers stenciled on the pinewood lids. 
A GUARD rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes a long, healthy pull from his canteen. He offers it to the PRISON CHAPLAIN, who is much obliged. SUPERINTENDENT BILL BURKE, a 40-year-old black man, glances at his watch and loosens his tie. Sure is hot. 
MARY HUMPHRIES, an elderly white woman in a nurse's uniform, stands behind WILLIE LONG, an ancient inmate sleeping peacefully in a wheelchair. She readjusts an umbrella to shield the old black man from the blistering sun. 
Burke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief. He gives the nod to the chaplain, who steps forward and cracks his bible. The men remove their hats. 
CHAPLAIN In accordance with the regulations of the State of Mississippi, we gather here today to lay to rest the remains of inmates R. Gibson, number 4316, and C. Banks, number 4317. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God have mercy on their souls. 
BURKE Go ahead, fellas. 
The young inmates plunge their shovels into the dirt. One by one, the mourners head back toward a prison van parked on a nearby dirt road. 
NURSE HUMPHRIES I'll come back for you in a little while, Willie... 
She leaves Willie alone with Jake and Leon. He rolls his chair up to the edge of the graves and gazes at the pinewood caskets. 
JAKE These two guys friends of yours, old man? 
WILLIE We spent some time together. 
LEON Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time. 
WILLIE I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932. 
LEON 1932? That's like, that's like... 
WILLIE Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys. 
Willie pulls a bottle of moonshine from his jacket and takes a swig in their honor. 
JAKE Hey, the dude's holdin'. 
LEON Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up. 
Willie passes the bottle to Leon, who takes a swig and winces from the unexpected kick. 
LEON Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday. 
JAKE I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files. (taking a swig from the bottle) Damn, that shit's nasty. 
WILLIE Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned. 
LEON What were they, bootleggers? 
Willie holds up the bottle, checking the clarity of the liquor. 
WILLIE Something like that. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
EXT. SPANKY'S BACK ALLEY (1932) -- NIGHT 
RAY GIBSON holds up a similar bottle of liquor to a light over a door. Music comes from within. He takes a swig and stashes the bottle in his belt. He adjusts his tie, polishes his shoes on the back of his pants and raps on the door. 
INT. SPANKY'S -- NIGHT 
The speakeasy is jumping, jammed with people. Up on stage a hot JAZZ BAND is playing backup for a seductive CHANTEUSE. Well-heeled PATRONS enter through doors near the stage. 
In the back, at the end of a long hallway, a BOUNCER cracks open the door and Ray squeezes inside. 
BOUNCER Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you. 
RAY Is Spanky here? 
BOUNCER No, but... 
RAY Then what's the problem? 
BOUNCER Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door. 
RAY But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?

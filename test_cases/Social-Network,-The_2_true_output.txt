INT. ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING ROOM - DAY 
MARK stands before a panel of ADMINISTRATORS as well as COX, the systems manager who was woken up in the opening sequence. 
ADMINISTRATOR Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative Board hearing. 
(MORE) 
ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) You're being accused of intentionally breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy by creating the website, WWW.FACEMASH.COM. You're also charged with being in violation of the university's policy on distribution of digitized images. Before we begin with our questioning you're allowed to make a statement. Would you like to do so? 
MARK 
(BEAT) Uh...I've, you know, I've apologized in the Crimson to the ABHW, to Fuerza Latina and to any women at Harvard who might have been insulted as I take it they were by the things that have been said tome in the last week. As for any charges stemming from the breach of security, I believe I deserve some sort of recognition from this Ad Board. 
ADMINISTRATOR 
(PAUSE) I'm sorry? 
MARK Yes. 
ADMINISTRATOR I don't understand. 
MARK Which part? 
ADMINISTRATOR You believe you deserve recognition? 
MARK I pointed-out some pretty gaping holes in your system. 
COX Excuse me, may I? 
ADMINISTRATOR Yes. 
COX Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm in charge of security for all computers on the Harvard system. I can assure you of its sophistication and in fact it was that level of sophistication that led us to you in less four hours. 
MARK Four hours? 
COX Yes sir. 
MARE That would be impressive except the algorithm I used was written on my dorm room window. Keep up the great work.

EXT. QUAD - CONTINUOUS 
EDU.ARDO It could have been worse.

EDUARDO It's alright. 
MARK No. 
EDUARDO It's okay. You're fine. 
MARK 
(PAUSE) I shouldn't have said the thing about the farm animals. That was stupid. Everybody's mad at me now. 
EDUARDO Maybe, but at least everybody knows you now.

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY 
MARX is in his Operating Systems class. This is considered the hardest class at Harvard and MARK is one of the 50 students with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an impossibly difficult lesson, 
PROFESSOR So let's look at a sample problem: Suppose we're given a computer with a 16- bit virtual address and a page size of 256 bytes. A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed over to MARK. While that's happening-- 
PROFESSOR (CONT'D) The system uses one-level page tables, which start at address 0x0400. Maybe you want to have DMA. on your 16-bit system, who knows? The first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc. MARK opens the note., It reads "Asshole". He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with contempt. 
PROFESSOR (CONT'D) Assume page table entries have eight status bits. MARK closes his laptop, gets up and starts to head out of the hall. 
PROFESSOR (CONT'D) The eight status bits would be-- 
(RE: MARK) And I see we have our first surrender. Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberï¿½, brighter, men than you have tried and failed at this class. 
MARK 
(CALLING BACK) 1 valid bit, 1 modify bit, 1 reference bit and 5 permission bits. 
MARK walks out of the lecture hall and we

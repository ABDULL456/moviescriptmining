IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRESTORM: All Pooch can see is FLAMES through the WINDSHIELD as they plow through the destruction. Glances in the REAR-VIEW: 
POOCH Uh, Coug? 
Cougar's sleeve, FULLY ABLAZE. He casually rips it off and tosses it out the back. 
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - The fire clears... to reveal a 30 FOOT DROP. The guys scream as they PLUNGE OVER IT... 
WHOOMP! The Truck buries itself nose first in the sand. 
EXT. AFGHAN DESERT -- DAY 
Silence. Smoke rises from a crater that was once the Fort. The doors of the truck creak open. Most of the YOUNGSTERS GIGGLE. Fun ride. As the guys help them out: 
JENSEN Yeah, that was great, wasn't it? My favorite part was when we were completely on fire. What was yours? 
Sounds of a BLACKHAWK CHOPPER APPROACHING... 
POOCH Exfil incoming. How are we gonna explain the kids, Colonel? 
Clay doesn't seem to hear him. 
POOCH (CONT'D) Colonel? (Clay looks up) The kids. What do we tell 'em? 
A beat. Clay seems to shake off his daze as the BLACKHAWK sets down. Walking up to the chopper: 
CLAY Lieutenant, you're to evac these civvies to the Firebase immediately- 
BLACKHAWK PILOT Negative, our orders are to transport a five-man team only. 
Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER CRUCIFIX hangs around it. Clay, softer: 
CLAY You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die? 
A beat. 
BLACKHAWK PILOT Not enough room for them and you... 
CLAY Then it's them. 
The Pilot nods. Our guys begin loading the kids on... 
JENSEN 
Clay helps Omar on last. The kid looks at him. He knows perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement. OMAR 
Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys. 
Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last Clay sees of him is that ratty little TEDDY BEAR... 
POOCH Cute little buggers. Hope they can make it to our court-martial. 
ROQUE Relax, Pooch, we're not going to be court-martialed - if anything, we're going to die of thirst wandering the desert, right Colonel? 
CLAY (IGNORES THIS) Jensen, see if you can cut into that Blackhawk's chatter--I want to know if he rats us out. 
As Jensen tunes his radio... 
POOCH So, how we getting back? Hitchhike? Magic carpet? I say magic carpet... 
ROQUE (NOTICING) Guess they hustled up some air support after all - that's a Pakistani MiG up there... 
Jensen's tuning into the MIG's frequency. Looking nervous. 
JENSEN Guys... This is bad... 
TURNS UP THE VOLUME: 
MIG PILOT (O.S.) Max, Cobra One. Bandit locked, twelve o'clock low... Their eyes go wide with understanding.... 
MAX (O.S.) Understood, Cobra One. Kill Bandit. 
Clay and Cougar have ALREADY BEGUN RUNNING towards the receding chopper on the horizon. As the MIG SWINGS IN BEHIND THE BLACKHAWK.... 
MIG PILOT (O.S.) (CALMLY) Fox One. 
WOOSH... The MIG FIRES - AIR TO AIR MISSILE... WHOOMP! The Blackhawk's tail rotor SHEARED OFF, the chopper spinning and falling but still intact... 
Pooch, the pilot, from somewhere SCREAMING: 
POOCH Auto-rotate, go with it, you can still put her down if you-

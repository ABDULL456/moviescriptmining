SHIFU Oogway cannot, not anymore. 
They notice Shifu holding Oogway's staff. They know what this means. They are saddened by the news. 
SHIFU (CONT'D) Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior. 
TIGRESS The panda? 
SHIFU Yes, the panda! 
TIGRESS Master, please. Let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for. 
SHIFU No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung. It is his. 
He dramatically points at Po... but Po is gone. 
SHIFU (CONT'D) Where'd he go? 
Shifu throws up his hands in frustration and heads after Po. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUNKHOUSE Â­ DAY 
Super wide shot as Po runs away from the compound. Closer as he continues running. He checks over his shoulder, turns back... Shifu lands right in front of him. 
SHIFU You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits! 
PO Watch me! 
He tries to maneuver around Shifu, but is redirected back. 
PO (CONT'D) Come on! How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs. 
SHIFU You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior! 
He pushes Po back with the staff. 
PO Ow! You don't believe that! You never believed that! From the first moment I got here, you've been trying to get rid of me. 
Shifu pokes him again, this time causing Po to fall on his back. 
SHIFU Yes. I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine. 
PO You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior. 
Po shoves the staff away and gets up. 
SHIFU Then why didn't you quit? You knew I was trying to get rid of you, and yet you stayed. 
PO Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt. But it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me. 
Po looks down at the Valley, then turns back to Shifu. 
PO (CONT'D) I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me, could make me... not me, it was you. The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China. 
SHIFU But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will! 
PO C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here right now. And even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you gonna change this... (indicate belly) ...into the Dragon Warrior? How? How? How?! 
In frustration, Shifu yells out the answer. 
SHIFU I don't know!!! (then, resigned) I don't know.

GUS Let's watch a movie. Hazel is again surprised. 
HAZEL Oh. Um. Uh... (yes!) Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this 
WEEK-- 
GUS No I mean now. 
HAZEL What? 
GUS Hmm? 
HAZEL What do you mean "now?" 
GUS I've got a car. He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident. 
HAZEL You could be an axe murderer. 
GUS There is that possibility. 
(BEAT) Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk. As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between his lips. 
HAZEL Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're kidding right? (off his look) You just ruined the whole thing! 
GUS Whole thing? 
HAZEL What, you think that's cool? Oh you idiot! There's always a hamartia, isn't there? And yours is - even though you had FREAKING CANCER you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire EVEN MORE CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so well. As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing. 
HAZEL Let me tell you... not being able to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks. 
GUS Hamartia? Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him. 
HAZEL A fatal flaw. Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still etched on his face. 
GUS They don't hurt you unless you light them. 
HAZEL Sorry? 
GUS I've never lit one. Hazel turns back to him. 
GUS It's a metaphor. See? You put the thing that kills you between your teeth. But you don't give it the power to do the killing. Hazel is floored. And impressed. 
HAZEL Metaphor. Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up. 
FRANNIE Hi sweetheart. Ready for some "Model?" 
Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom. 
HAZEL Can't tonight. (off her confused look) I've made plans with Augustus Waters. And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO: 
INT GUS'S CAR - LATER Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face. 
GUS I failed the test a couple times. 
HAZEL You don't say. 
GUS Most amputees can drive with no problem but... yeah. Not me. 
HAZEL I'm surprised you have a license. 
GUS Tell me about it! Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt. 
GUS The fourth time I took the test... it was going about how this is going... and when it was over, the instructor looks at me and goes, "your driving, while unpleasant... is not technically unsafe." 
HAZEL Aha. Cancer perk. 
GUS Total cancer perk. A few beats of silence.

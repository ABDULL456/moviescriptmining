A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed than to turn back, and he rides into their midst, approaching a group of officers. 
He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map. 
During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if Roderick will honor him with his company. 
To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer, and the two men mount up, and ride off together. 
EXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY 
Roderick and Galgenstein riding together. 
Dialogue under voice over. 
RODERICK (V.O.) My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN What is your uncle's name? 
RODERICK (slowly) O'Grady. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (with a laugh) Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady... 
EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY 
Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads together, jogging on. 
They pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a red-coated Hanoverian sergeant. 
He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain Galgenstein. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN It hurts my feelings to be obliged to commune with such wretches, but the stern necessities of war demand men continually, and hence these recruiters whom you see market in human flesh.  They get five-and- twenty thaler a man from our government for every man they bring in.  For fine men -- for men like you. (he adds laughing) They would go as high as hundred. 
EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON 
Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely- looking place. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner? 
RODERICK This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe? 
Roderick smiles. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you. 
RODERICK The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers. 
They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place. 
A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their horses are littered under a shed hard by. 
Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their hats to the captain. 
The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter. 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (explaining the gate) Parties of French horsemen are about the country, and one cannot take too many precautions against such villains. 
The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his bedroom. 
Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his pains. 
They enter into supper. 
INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON 
A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely creature which had been expected; and the captain, laughing, says: 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Well, our meal is a frugal one, but a soldier has many a time a worse. 
Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the captain's is laid. 
The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine, at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a considerable ill-humor. 
RODERICK (when she leaves) Where's the beauty you promised me? 
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (laughing and looking hard at Roderick) It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.

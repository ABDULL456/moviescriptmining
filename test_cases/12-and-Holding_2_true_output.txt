Kenny rides off. Jacob watches him go.       He has a lifeless, almost calculating look in his eyes. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Grace lies in a hosptial bed, watching TV. Leonard enters, dressed in a hospital gown. Grace turns to him, smiling. 
GRACE Leonard! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LEONARD I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to leave the gas on. It was an accident. And everything that happened, I... I just thought that maybe, I could help you. 
GRACE Leonard, my mother died at 52. We had to cremate her body because they didn't make a coffin big enough for her to fit in. Even if they had, no one could have carried it. (tearing up) I loved her so much. I don't want that to happen to me. 
LEONARD It doesn't have to. 
GRACE Even if I can manage the food... Can you honestly see me, running a marathon? 
LEONARD You don't have to run a marathon. You just have to run to the end of the block. It's not so hard as you think it is. 
GRACE I'll try. 
Leonard leans over and kisses his mother's forehead. 
GRACE (cont'd) I spoke to your father. He and the girls caught a flight. They should be here by morning. 
LEONARD Did you tell him what happened? 
GRACE I told him there was a gas leak. 
LEONARD I meant... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GRACE I know what you meant. I didn't tell him. I don't think I will. 
Leonard smiles. 
INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
Jacob lies awake, staring out the window.     A heavy wind blows. 
SFX: WATCH ALARM 
Jacob sits up and silences his watch alarm. 
Keith awakens as well, but remains silent. He watches as Jacob grabs a bag and exits the house through the window. 
Once he's gone, Keith gets off the top bunk, crosses to the window and watches as Jacob runs off. 
Immediately, Keith crosses to the closet. He removes the lock box and begins trying combinations to open it. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER 
A heavy rain begins to fall as Jacob rides up. He sees Kenny, standing inside of a partially, constructed house. 
KENNY You're late. 
JACOB I'm here. 
Kenny throws Jacob a PONCHO. 
KENNY Put this on. 
Jacob removes his backpack and puts on the poncho. Then he opens his backpack and removes his HOCKEY MASK. (The same mask he was wearing at the beginning of the movie.) 
KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd) What the fuck is that? 
JACOB If people see me riding around in the middle of the night, we're screwed. You didn't bring a disguise? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KENNY Who gives a shit what I'm up to. 
The boys start riding off in opposite directions.

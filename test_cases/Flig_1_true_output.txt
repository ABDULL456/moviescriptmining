The animation has a split screen that also shows the instruments and printed text of what's being said. 
We hear..."What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box" "I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you." "What are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control." 
That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in progress. 
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) That audio is tragic and compelling. I chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment aboard flight 227, wherein you say "We're gonna roll it, here we go, I've got control." You made a very conscious decision to invert the airplane, to roll the plane upside down. Is that correct? 
WHIP I'm not sure it was conscious. It was more of an instinct. 
ELLEN BLOCK What led to that decision? 
WHIP is clearly struggling in his chair. The coke got him there but it may start to fail him soon. 
WHIP I don't recall. 
ELLEN BLOCK Let me quote from an investigative summary..."From 9:34 until 9:42 the events on the aircraft are"...again I quote, "bold and remarkable"... "By inverting the plane, Captain Whitaker arrested the descent and allowed the aircraft to level off enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field. 
We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions are remarkable. 
WHIP I heard a metallic bang. We pitched nose down. No control. 
WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still coursing through his exhausted frame. 
ELLEN BLOCK You had no idea what was wrong with the aircraft? 
WHIP There was a lot of things wrong with that aircraft. 
WHIP glances towards HUGH and CHARLIE who are poker-faced. 
ELLEN BLOCK As I said before you can add any details you like to any comments I make. Do you remember any thing else that was out of the ordinary? Did you feel the flight crew was in their best shape? 
WHIP takes a minute to digest this question. 
WHIP Yes. 
ELLEN BLOCK It was raining very hard the morning you took off, wasn't it? 
WHIP There was some convective activity in the area. However, my first officer and I discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind minimums. 
ELLEN BLOCK Yes, first officer Evans' testimony confirms the same. 
WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her glasses, seeing if he has any reaction. WHIP smiles. 
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) I want to show you something. 
HUGH is frozen in a steely gaze; CHARLIE seems to hold his breath. 
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Nothing's happening. 
ELLEN points her remote at the projector but it doesn't work. 
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) This remote is not working. Apologies. I can do it manually. 
She shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to WHIP where she can advance the slides by touching the projector. 
We now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal screw the size of a trombone. 
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) This is the jackscrew on the tail assembly which articulates the horizontal stabilizer--also known as the elevator. As you can see, the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone. " 
Substandard thread life" is how we reported it. This part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in January of 2010. It was never replaced. 
This had 1200 additional hours of flight on it. It finally failed. 
AN ANIMATION SHOWS THE TAIL ASSEMBLY. 
We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend. 
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position, locking the elevator in a down position which forced the plane into a dive. The loss of the elevator was, and I quote our report, a "catastrophic event, from which recovery was improbable and stable flight impossible." 
Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ELLEN's tone changes as she understands how hard this is for some people to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last living minutes on this earth in sheer terror. 
It is deathly quiet in the ballroom. Even the PRESS are silent. 
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Again I quote..."From 9:34 until 9:42 the piloting decisions made by Captain Whitaker were bold and remarkable. The fact that Captain Whitaker commanded that the aircraft stay inverted while descending to an extremely low altitude shows a miraculous intuition that in this instance saved 96 lives." 
A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room. ELLEN BLOCK allows this moment to happen. 
WHIP is fading, dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected adulation. He stands up. 
WHIP I appreciate that. 
The room gets quiet as WHIP's demeanor seems terse. 
WHIP stares at ELLEN, white with sweat and chemicals. We see HUGH grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on tilt. 
ELLEN BLOCK Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about the days leading and hours leading up to the accident. But before I do, I want to remind you that you are under oath and any testimony that you give here today will be considered admissable in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings, do you understand what that means? 
WHIP nods. 
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Captain Whitaker, for the record I need you to verbalize your answer. 
WHIP Yes, I understand. 
ELLEN BLOCK On the three days leading up to the day of the accident -- Tuesday, October 11th, Wednesday, October 12th or Thursday, October 13th of 2011 -- did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements? 
WHIP takes his time. 
WHIP No. I did not. 
HUGH AND CHARLIE

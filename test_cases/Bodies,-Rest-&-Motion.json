{"train": "He pours himself a drink. Carol shuts the cabinet. \nNICK I know what's going to happen. \nNick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty bottle in the trash. He begins to pace. Carol shuts the cabinet and follows him with her gaze. \nAs Nick speaks, he gestures grandly with his drink, liquor splashing unnoticed over the sides. \nNICK (bursting with frustration) The same job, same scenery, same people... I've been in this town for years... Years!! \nCAROL (flatly) Three years. \nNICK (in despair) Oh, Carol... \nCAROL I know... \nHe stops and slugs back his drink. \nNICK Forever -- it seems forever. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BETH'S PINTO - CONTINUOUS \nBeth pulls up to a stoplight, her face blank with thought. She's suddenly lit by the flash of headlights going on and off. She looks up and smiles. \nEXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS \nSid's pick-up truck is facing her across the intersection. It slowly pulls up beside her and stops. \nHe smiles and gives a little wave of his hand. \nWithout knowing why, she smiles and waves back. \nBETH (sweetly but firmly) Good-bye. \nShe drives away. Sid stares after her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCarol lifts the end metal ball on the thingabobby and releases it, starting the chain reaction. She stares at it clacking back and forth as she speaks. \nCAROL How long a drive is it? \nNick paces. \nNICK Fourteen hours. \nCAROL That's not bad. \nNICK In a car? It's a fuckin' nightmare. \nCarol stops the metal ball. She releases two balls, starting a new chain reaction. \nNICK (griping) And there's no radio in Utah. It's all religious programs. \nCAROL Get saved. \nNick slumps on the sofa beside her. \nNICK (flatly) No thanks. \nCAROL Hey. Think about this. You take a detour and go through Vegas -- you and Beth stop, see a show, have a nice romantic dinner -- play the slots, get the free drinks... \nNICK (interrupting) Too much money. The show. The meal. The slots. Then the hotel -- that's another hundred down the toilet. \nAs Carol speaks she pokes at Nick. He fends off her blows. By the end of her speech she is on top of him mock-strangling him. \nCAROL (jabbing Nick) No, you skip the hotel. It's night, the highway's empty -- you can make good time. You start speeding. You get stopped in Utah by the cops -- you flunk the breathalizer, they haul you in. The judge is Mormon -- you get fifteen years, you go to prison, but at least your life has taken a direction! \nNick and Carol collapse into laughter. The front door opens. \nBETH (calling in) I'm here! \nBeth steps in. Carol quickly lets go of Nick's neck and gets off him. \nNICK AND CAROL \nNICK Then what is it? \nShe pulls away from him and starts walking to the house next door. He falls into step with her. \nBETH (uncomfortably) I, umm... I... It embarrasses me. When you talk about something with Carol that happened before me. She's my best friend. It embarrasses me that you used to live with her. \nNICK That was years ago. \nBETH Three years. \nNICK That's right. \nBETH I know... \nNICK And we're moving. She won't be your best friend anymore. \nThey arrive at their front door. Beth takes out her keys. Nick stops her hand and kisses her. She kisses him back. \nNICK Living with someone isn't such a big deal. \nShe nods and looks to the lock. \nNICK Anyway... I live with you now. \nBeth looks to Nick. He stares out at the night. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE-UP: COFFEE-MAKER \nThe coffee-maker clock hits nine o'clock. The coffee maker clicks on with a rattle. Steam starts to spew out. \nThe coffee-maker makes horrible gurgling sounds. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nThe kitchen is small and a little grimy, its furnishings fatigued. \nNick stares at the coffee-maker in disbelief. He's dressed in a dress shirt, untied necktie, and slacks. He's carrying a sportscoat with a Sears' employee name-tag attached. \nNICK (calling out) Beth!... Beth!! \nBeth walks into the kitchen, wearing a robe and carrying the paper. \nNick points accusingly at the coffee maker as water pours down from around its top. \nNICK It's... it's raining! \nBETH It does that. \nShe drops the paper on the kitchen table and gets a mug off the counter. \nNICK Since we got it? \nBETH No. (pouring herself a cup) Lately. \nNICK (throwing his jacket on a chair) Shit. (agitated) What's wrong with it? \nBETH Water comes out. \nNICK Shit. (unplugging the coffee maker) I hate this shit! It never kept the coffee hot. And now this. \nHe angrily wraps the cord around the coffee-maker. \nBETH (blowing on her coffee) It still works. \nNICK (adamant) No. It doesn't. Water comes out. \nBETH Okay. \nShe sips her coffee. She flips open a box of Dunkin' Donuts. \nNICK I could've gotten a new one. On my discount. Now it's too late. \nBETH Do you want a donut? \nNICK (exasperated) No. I want an appliance that works. \nBeth shrugs and takes a donut out of the box. She leans against the counter, eating the donut. \nSID Now if it was my house, I would choose a color... \nBeth kneels down, holding the tape, as he arrives at her end of the wall. \nSID I would not choose off-white. \nBeth holds out the tape. They are kneeling next to each other. \nBETH What would you choose? \nSID The color of your eyes. (pause, without looking) Hazel. \nBeth stares at Sid. Sid looks to Beth. Smiling, he takes the tape from her fingers. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PIZZA HUT - AFTERNOON \nAn oasis in the center of a packed mall parking lot. Carol hurries toward the front entrance in a snappy skirt and blazer combo, a Bullock's name tag attached to her lapel. \nINT. PIZZA HUT - CONTINUOUS \nNick is sitting at a booth, a beer in front of him, lost in thought. \nCarol arrives, drops a gift-wrapped box on the table, and scoots into the booth. \nCAROL Sorry I'm late, the new girl's a moron. \nNICK (looking to the present) What's that? \nCAROL Going away present. \nNick takes it. \nNICK Thanks. \nHe quickly unwraps it. \nNICK (happily) A map! \nCAROL I thought you might need it. \nNICK (unfolding it) I do! I had a map -- I lost it. \nHe spreads the map out over the table. \nCAROL (organized) Let's highlight your route. \nA MAP \nof the Western half of the U.S.A. fills the FRAME. Carol's hand, holding a bright red felt-tip pen, ENTERS FRAME. \nCAROL (O.S.) Here's Enfield. \nShe circles it. Nick's finger ENTERS FRAME. \nNICK (O.S.) Here's Billings. \nCarol circles Billings. Nick's finger starts to trace the route. \nCarol's pen follows, marking the route. Halfway to Billings, Nick's finger abruptly stops. Carol stops the pen at the same point. \nNICK (O.S.) Look at this -- right there -- that's the town I was born in. \nNICK AND CAROL \nHe looks to her for a reaction. \nNICK (emphatically) Where I grew up. Where my parent's live... Isn't that a coincidence? \nCAROL Visit them. \nNICK (shaking his head) Oh... no... \nCAROL You're going to be driving by. \nNICK No... (shaking his head) They're not near the interstate. (sort of chagrined) I haven't even called them in years. \nCAROL You might as well visit. \nSID (smiling) I guess he'd be the \"they\". \nBETH He'd find us. And he'd be surprised. \nSid gets off the bed and with a grin, gingerly pats out the wrinkles he's made in the bed spread. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON \nNick and Carol are walking away from the Pizza Hut, across a huge parking lot, toward a large mall. Cars circle past them, searching for close spots. \nNICK (doggedly) It was the drive that killed us. San Antonio to Seattle is just too many hours in a car. If we'd have flown, we would've made it. \nCAROL (shaking her head) No... \nNICK Things were all right in bed. \nCAROL But the rest of the time they were... awful. \nNICK (hurt) Really? \nCAROL (flatly) Nick. We couldn't stand each other. We stopped in Enfield and just stayed. \nNICK (after a beat) Why didn't you go on to Seattle? It was your car. \nCarol stops. On her face, the answer to his question is clear -- she was stuck on Nick then and she's still stuck on him now. \nBut she'd never let him know that. \nCAROL (dryly) Big trees scare me. \nShe starts walking. Nick hurries up beside her. They walk side by side for a few paces before the shotdown Nick comes up with a new ploy to win favor. \nNICK (casually) I'm thinking about stealing a t.v. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NICK AND BETH'S BEDROOM HALLWAY - AFTERNOON \nBeth's taking extra sheets and towels from the linen closet and packing them in liquor boxes. \nSid enters from the living room. \nSID (cheerfully) I'm done in there. I won't paint the ceiling 'til you've moved the furniture out. \nBETH I don't think we're going to take much of the furniture. \nSID No? \nBETH It's ugly. \nSID I kind of like the sofa. \nBETH It's a sofa bed. \nSID You're not going to take it? \nBETH (flatly) It weighs two thousand pounds. \nSID Can I have it? \nBETH It's yours. \nSID Excellent. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe furniture is kind of ugly, but the walls look great. The whole room seems brighter, almost magically more cheerful. \nSid runs into the room and flops onto the sofa. He settles in and sighs contentedly. \nThe front door BURSTS open. Sid leaps up. \nCarol races into the room. \nCAROL (excited) Nick's gonna steal a t.v.! \nShe sees Sid and freezes. \nRORY I do. \nNICK (laying it out) You see... you go to a movie, you're there. \nRory listens attentively. \nNICK You watch t.v., you're thirteen places at once. As many channels as you get, that's as many places as you are. You get cable? You're forty places at once. You get a satellite dish?... \nRORY You're all over the world. \nNICK Exactly. \nIn the BACKGROUND, on the big screen t.v., the soap actress breaks the embrace and points a gun at the actor. \nNICK You're everywhere. \nThe soap actress shoots the actor. He stares at her in overacting disbelief and slumps to the floor. \nNICK It's called freedom. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCarol watches as Sid whistles cheerfully, ripping the long strips of masking tape off the trim. \nCAROL (w/ attitude) This is what you do? \nSID I also mow lawns. \nCAROL Which is your career? \nSID Painting. I'm an inside person. (confidentially) Mowing grass is seasonal. \nCAROL (dryly) That is true. \nSid wads the tape into a big ball. \nSID (disarmingly) You've got a nice tan. \nCAROL (not disarmed) I work on it. \nSid shoots the tape ball into his shopping cart of supplies. \nSID Do you want to get stoned? \nCarol thinks for a moment. It's been a long time and she's not crazy about him being there. \nCAROL (after a beat) Yeah. \nSid takes a joint out of his shirt pocket. \nSID This kind of painting -- for people I won't know -- it's boring. (lighting the joint) It's not very good. It's homegrown. \nHe takes a drag. \nCAROL Yeah? \nSID But it'll get you fucked up. \nHe hands the joint to Carol. \nCAROL \ntakes a drag on the joint like an old pro. \nSID (O.S.) It'll take you someplace. \nCarol chokes back wheezes and then explodes in a coughing fit. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APPLIANCE CENTER - LATER \nNick and MAJOR JENKINS, a uniformed military man in his late forties, are standing in front of a wall of silent color televisions. On the t.v.s a nearly identical pairs of LOCAL ANCHORS smile their way through the news. \nNICK Have you thought about American? \nMAJOR JENKINS No. \nNICK (interrupting, pleasantly) Miss... I'm helping this customer here, perhaps you might... (firmly, a salesman's put-off) You might want to see someone else. \nBETH (pointedly) You can't help me? \nNICK (after a beat, then w/ finality) Not really. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEARS - CONTINUOUS \nBeth rides down on the escalator, the receipt clenched in her hand, surrounded by other shoppers, as a tinny Muzak version of the \"Theme from The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" drones on in the background. \nConflicting emotions cloud her face. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE-UP - A HUGE T.V. BOX \nSID (O.S.) How'd you do it? \nBETH (O.S.) Nick sold a demo, wrote it up like a new set, and gave me the receipt. \nAs Sid's jacknife ENTERS FRAME and zips through the packing tape, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal... \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe sun is low, giving the room a golden glow. \nSid and Beth are sitting on the sofa, the t.v. box on the floor in front of them. \nSid opens the television box. Slowly, he pulls out the sheets of bubbled packing plastic. He pops several of the bubbles. \nSID (savoring the bubble plastic) Excellent. \nBETH Maybe I should just leave it packed... \nSID C'mon! You stole it. You gotta see it! Hold the box. \nBeth holds the box. Sid starts to lift out the television. \nSID (urgently) Wait! \nBeth looks to him, anxiously. \nSID I thought I heard the police. \nBeth listens, nervously. Sid grins. \nBETH Ha ha ha. (an amused realization) You're stoned! \nSID (innocently) Me? \nBETH You're being silly and you've got bunny eyes. \nEmbarrassed, Sid pulls Visine from a pocket and drips it in his eyes as he speaks. \nSID I'm a little stoned... not that stoned. \nBETH No? \nSID No. (after a beat) Carol's really stoned. \nBETH You got Carol stoned? \nSID Very stoned. \nBETH I didn't think she liked you. \nSID She doesn't. But she likes getting stoned. \nBETH (smiling) She does. \nSID There's nothing like drugs to create a quick and shallow friendship. \nBeth laughs. \nSID (rubbing his hands) Let's look at the loot. \nSid pulls the t.v. up and out of the box. He sits back on the sofa, the t.v. in his lap. \nBeth turns off the t.v. There's a moment of awkward silence as they all stare at the blank screen. \nCAROL (breaking the silence, pointedly) How's the painting going? \nSID (shaking his head) Too many distractions. I'll be at it all night. \nCAROL You have bad work habits. \nSID Not when I'm actually working. (standing) I better get set up in the kitchen. \nHe goes to his shopping cart of supplies. Carol and Beth stare at the television. \nThe television stares back at them, gleamingly modern. \nCAROL It makes teevee seem very futuristic. \nSID (at the kitchen door) That's 'cause you're stoned. \nCAROL I'm hardly stoned. \nShe looks to Beth. Beth is grinning. \nCAROL (mitigating) It was homegrown. \nBETH (teasing) Want some Visine? \nCAROL (flatly) No. \nSID (O.S.) (calling out) It gets the red out. \nThe Visine comes flying INTO FRAME. Carol fumbles, then catches it. \nCAROL (dryly) Thank you. \nCarol tilts back her head and manuevers the Visine. \nCAROL Shit. Missed the eye, got the face. \nBETH Need help? \nCAROL Yeah. \nBeth goes to her and takes the Visine. \nBETH Okay. (holding Carol's arm) Tilt your head back. \nCAROL Beth... \nBETH Stop fidgeting. \nShe puts a drop in one eye. Carol flinches. \nCAROL Got it. \nBETH Next eye. \nCAROL Wait a second. \nCarol blinks and wipes a Visine tear off her cheek. \nCAROL (nodding to the kitchen, in a conspiratorial whisper) He really wants to get in your pants. \nBETH (smiling) My pants are taken. \nShe tilts Carol's head back. \nBETH Why don't you go for him? \nCAROL He likes you. \nBeth puts a drop in Carol's eye. Carol flinches and rubs her eye. \nBETH I wish Nick would get back and help with the packing. \nShe sighs, cheerfully exasperated. \nBETH He's probably getting drunk with the stockboys... (after a beat) That's what he's probably doing. \nCarol braces herself. \nNick stares out at the moonlit desert and the mountains rising in the distance. \nNICK So what does the wind mean? Like as an omen or something, you know -- (making his voice mystical) -- a change is coming to the people. -- the spirit of freedom is walking the land. (flatly) That kind of meaning... \nNAVAJO TEEN (handing him money) Fourteen, fifteen and five makes twenty. \nHe opens Nick's car door for him. \nNAVAJO TEEN The wind is. It's the wind like I'm a Navajo. \nNICK That's it? \nThe Navajo teen nods. \nNICK Shit. \nHe gets in the car, his mood darkening, and pulls his door shut with a slam. \nNICK (out the window) It would be better if meant something. \nThe Navajo teen shrugs. Nick starts the engine. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A BAR IN ENFIELD - NIGHT \nA dimly lit room filled with raucous customers and lots of neon beer signs. Waitresses in red dresses tote pitchers of brew to the thirsty throng. At the far end a band plays a foot-stompin' good time tune about a trucker on his way to see his woman. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES through the crowd and discovers Carol and Beth sitting at a small table, an almost finished pitcher of beer between them. \nThey speak loudly to be heard over the din. \nCAROL He said he needs to be alone again. Learn about himself. Make a fresh start in a new town. \nBeth shakes her head then takes a sip of her beer -- it tastes bitter in her mouth and she puts her glass down in disgust. \nCAROL (after a beat) He's sorry. \nBeth stares at her beer. Carol puts a hand comfortingly on Beth's arm. \nCAROL He said he would have called you, but your phone's disconnected. 'Cause you're moving. (after a beat) He's always been an asshole. (after a beat) You'll be all right. \nBETH Yeah... \nCAROL (gently) I'm here. \nBETH I know that. \nA big-haired WAITRESS approaches the table. \nWAITRESS You ready for another? \nCarol looks to Beth. \nBETH Oh... uh, no... \nCAROL We're fine. \nWAITRESS Is Nick coming in? \nCarol throws the waitress a look that could kill. Beth takes a deep breath. \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. NICK'S SEDAN - HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nNick stares at the road ahead. He takes rapid drags on a cigarette. The RADIO is barely audible over the ROAR of the WIND through the open windows. \nPREACHER'S VOICE (covered by static) \"And he arose and came to his father, but when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and...\" \nNick turns the radio off. \nHe fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray. \nHe takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it, takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it back on the seat. \nHe stares at the road. He looks down to the front seat and finds the map. He splits his attention between the road and unfolding the map. The wind catches the map. \nThe map billows up, covering his face. Losing control of the car, Nick slaps it down. \nBeth smiles weakly. Abruptly, she drops her donut back in the box. \nSID (cautiously) Are you all right? \nBETH (apologetically) Must be the paint fumes... \nShe opens up the back door and steps out. Sid stares at the empty doorway. \nEXT. BACK STOOP - CONTINUOUS \nBeth stands in the moonlight, staring out at the stars. \nBETH (contemplatively dubious) You find what you want here? \nSid steps out behind her. \nSID It seems that way. \nBETH Yeah? \nSID (simply) I found you. \nBETH Oh. No... \nShe walks out into the backyard. Sid follows her. \nSID (earnestly) We never met before last night... \nThe moonlight through the orange trees casts a magical air about the backyard. Beth stops by a swingset. \nSID ...but we know each other. \nBeth stiffens. \nBETH No... \nShe walks away from him. He watches her intently. \nSID Leave it behind. \nShe looks to him. \nBETH Leave what behind? \nSID Unhappiness. \nBETH (amused) That was a bad answer. \nSID (seriously) No. It was true. \nBeth stares at Sid. \nBETH It's not. \nSID Come hold me. (after a beat) Come hold me, and you'll be happy. \nBETH (dryly) I'll find happiness. Right. In your arms. \nSID Yes. \nBETH In you. \nSID Yes. \nBETH But I won't. I have to find happiness in myself. \nSID No. That's wrong. (going toward her) People tell you that, but it's wrong. \nShe turns away from him. He stands behind her, close. \nSID I've lived with people who have that happiness from within. That happiness -- it's just them being pleased with themselves. It's not enough. It's a lonely thing. \nShe turns and faces him. The moonlight casts a pale glow over them. \nShe stares in his eyes for a long moment. She steps back from him. \nBETH You're showing how young you are. \nSID No. I'm not. I'm showing you a way. You know that. And you know me. (after a beat) And I know you. \nNICK Nice to meet you. \nHe holds out a hand to Mr. August, who slowly shakes it. \nELIZABETH He's deaf. \nNICK (loudly) Nice to meet you. \nELIZABETH He's stone deaf. \nNICK Oh. (uncomfortably) Yelling doesn't help. \nELIZABETH No. \nNick breaks the handshake. Mr. August smiles at him. Nick looks to Elizabeth. \nNICK My name is Nick, Nick Brennan. \nHe waits for her to introduce herself. She doesn't. \nNICK Did you know the Brennans? \nELIZABETH No. \nNICK They lived here. They used to live here. I used to live here with them... \nElizabeth stares at him. Nick tries his salesman charm. \nNICK What's your name? \nELIZABETH Elizabeth. \nNICK No... \nELIZABETH Yes. \nNICK I know an Elizabeth. (quietly) I call her Beth. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BETH'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nBathed in moonlight, Sid and Beth make tender passionate love. \nSid has never wanted someone so much and Beth has never felt so wanted. \nBeth clings to Sid as if she were afraid of being swept away... and then she is. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MR. AUGUST'S DINING ROOM - LATER \nA chandelier casts a gently sparkling golden glow. \nThe CAMERA TILTS down to reveal... \nMr. August, Elizabeth and Nick, sitting at a large antique dining room table. \nNick is eating a sandwich, an untouched glass of milk in front of him. Mr. August and Elizabeth watch him, expectantly. Nick notices this. \nNICK (swallowing) This is a good sandwich. \nELIZABETH Thank you. \nNICK (abruptly nodding toward Mr. August) When did he move here? Would he know where the people before him went? \nELIZABETH No. He wouldn't remember. \nNICK You're sure? \nELIZABETH Yes. He doesn't remember anymore. \nNICK Oh. (taking a deep breath) He can't help me. \nELIZABETH No. \nNick looks around the familiar room, struck by the absurdity of the situation. \nNICK (with wry awareness) I've lost my parents. \nBETH (hushed) The moment's gone. \nSID (shaking his head) It can go on as long as we want. \nBeth leans him back, cradling him in her arms. She stares at him, a quizzical expression on her face. \nBETH (skeptically) Have you ever been in a relationship? \nSID No. (after a beat) I was married... but it wasn't really a relationship. \nBETH (incredulous) You weren't married... \nSID Two years. Right out of high school. \nBeth ponders this for a moment. \nBETH Do I remind you of her? \nSID No. \nBETH (relieved) Thank God. \nSid runs his hands over her body. \nSID You have beautiful skin... her skin was polka-dotted. \nBETH Freckled... \nSID When we were kids we called her \"Spot\". \nBETH (laughing) What happened? \nSID She disappeared. \nBeth looks to Sid. He's staring off. \nBETH (after a beat) Was she ever found? \nA flicker of loss crosses his face. \nSID No. Not by me... (looking to Beth) I didn't go look. \nBeth stares at him, uncertainly. He leans up and gently traces circles on Beth's skin. \nSID She wanted to meet someone new. I asked her \"why?\" -- she said, \"Because he won't know me from before. Just now. Just what I am now.\" \nBeth looks to him, puzzled. \nSID I knew her... on playgrounds... in Sunday School... all those grades -- I knew her as she changed. But she was still the same person. All the times I knew her, she was still her. (after a beat) She can't get away from that. \nHe holds Beth tightly. \nSID You stay in one place, and all those things that are you... are there. She didn't understand that if you leave, they're still there, in you -- but they stop being clear. You stop knowing who you are, and what you want. \nBETH You've stayed here and you know who you are? \nHe moves away from Beth. \nSID I see the lawns I mow, houses I've painted, faces I know... my parents... And I'm constantly reminded of who I am. \nBETH And you know what you want. \nSID I want you. \nBETH Oh. \nSID I want to be inside you. \nBETH Good. (after a beat) Come here and put it inside me. \nSID No... I want to be able to put myself inside of you. \nBETH Doing this is as close as you get. \nBeth pulls Sid close, bringing him into her. \nBETH Come here. \nSID I love you. \nSuddenly she realizes it's not Nick. She pulls away, orientating herself. She quickly scoots out of bed and hurriedly pulls on a pair of jeans. \nThe alarm clock CLANGS. \nBeth looks about for the alarm. She tensely scatters some boxes. She dumps one, finds the alarm and shuts it off. She stares at the clock and drops it into a box. \nSID (O.S.) (cheerfully) Morning. \nBeth cringes slightly and turns to face Sid. \nSID AND BETH \nBETH (attempting a smile) Hi. \nSID (grinning) Hi. \nBETH I didn't want to wake you. \nSID (cheerfully) I'm awake. I'm a morning person. \nBETH I'm not. \nSID Then why don't you come back to bed? \nBETH I've got to pack. \nSID (sitting up) Where do we start? \nBETH (firmly) No. (softening) You paint. \nShe looks around the room littered with boxes and piles of clothes. \nBETH I'll manage. \nSID (cheerfully) Whatever you say. \nSid gets out of bed, wrapping the sheet around himself. Beth stares at the room. She suddenly trembles. She steadies herself on the bed table. \nBETH Oh God... \nSID (concerned) What? \nBeth avoids his eyes, glancing around the room. \nBETH (an outpouring) I'd be so much happier if I could blame this on Nick, but it always happens to me. I'm always left with nothing. (taking a deep breath) It doesn't matter if I leave the guy or if the guy leaves me -- I'm left with nothing. I never do anything for myself. I never acquire anything. I mean Nick didn't take from me. He stole a t.v. and left it for me. He didn't take my things, he didn't take our things... he didn't even take his clothes! And I'll still leave this house with nothing! \nSID He took three years from you. \nBETH No... (meeting his eyes) He didn't take 'em. I mean, when he cared about me, he cared about me. And he was really good in bed. \nShe glances away from Sid toward the bed. \nBETH (after a beat) I didn't expect more. \nShe turns away from Sid and the bed. Sid moves toward her. \nSID (carefully) Beth... \nBeth summons up all the composure she can manage. \nBETH (referring to the cluttered room) I can't face this. (looking to Sid) I'm gonna finish up the kitchen... (heading for the door) ...get some momentum... \nShe goes out the bedroom door. Sid stares after her. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ABANDONED REST STOP - MORNING \nNick's sedan is parked in the same place as the night before. \nA YOUNG MAN with long hair ROARS into the rest stop on a Harley-Davidson, his life's possession strapped on the back. \nHe stops the bike between Nick's car and the phonebooth, idling the engine, loudly. He looks to the phonebooth, the receiver dangling. He turns to Nick's sedan. \nYOUNG MAN Phone work? \nNICK \nAwakened by the ROAR, Nick has wearily leaned his head out the window. \nCAROL Let's do things, get you busy. \nBETH Yeah. \nCAROL You get all the stuff you wanna sell, and I'll make some tag sale signs. \nBETH No one'll buy my stuff. It's all junk. \nCAROL That's what people buy at tag sales. Broken appliances, ugly knicknacks. \nBeth looks at the semi-packed boxes. \nBETH (laughing) I guess I do have stuff to sell. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BETH'S FRONT LAWN - DAY \nBoxes full of a motley collection of knickknacks, housewares, and crummy appliances are spread out on the lawn. \nIn the BACKGROUND a couple of M.T.V. influenced teens are checking out the knickknacks and goofing on them. \nMRS. DOTSON, a woman in her late forties wearing a NURSE'S UNIFORM is poking through the odds and ends. \nBeth and Carol hovering near her. \nMrs. Dotson picks up the coffee maker, examines it, and puts it down. She picks up the blender, examines it, and puts it down. \nCAROL (impatiently) Is there something specific you're looking for? \nMRS. DOTSON Yes. (sheepishly) Actually everything... I don't have anything. \nBETH Nothing? \nMRS. DOTSON I just moved to town.

His mother hurries him away. \nNAVAJO WOMAN Maybe a nice Navajo rug? \nBETH (shaking her head) I can't. (after a beat, admitting her feelings) He gets to me... too much. If I don't go I'll end up with staying with him. \nCAROL (gently) You've done worse. \nBETH Sure. \nThey look at each other and start to laugh.

(softly) Sid? \nSid turns and looks, smiling. \nSID'S POV \nBeth is standing in the doorway, a weariness having settled over her. She steps into the room. \nBETH AND SID \nSID Hi. \nBETH I'm sorry about selling the sofa bed. \nSID I didn't really need one. When my friends get drunk, they throw up and sleep on the floor. \nBETH But I gave it to you. \nHe puts his arms around her. \nSID You gave me a lot more. \nBETH No. (holding him tightly) It was all even in this department. \nSID (softly) ...Feel me? \nBETH (whispering) I know... You're hard again. \nHolding her tightly, Sid runs his fingers down her spine. \nSID I want you all the time. \nBETH (torn) Shit. \nShe kisses him. They kiss, long and hard. Abruptly, she breaks the embrace and moves away from him. \nBETH (ironically self-aware) I just fleeced a widow. \nSID (protesting) No... \nBETH It was all junk. \nShe shivers. \nBETH Shit. I've got to get some aspirin... (shaking her head) I didn't drink enough to be hung over. \nShe walks away from Sid, out of the bedroom. \nINT. BETH'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nBeth gulps down aspirin. She stares at herself in the mirror, wearily searching. \nIN THE MIRROR \nSid appears in the doorway, his reflection small next to the reflection of her face. \nSID You just feel bad for her like I feel bad for her... 'cause her husband died. \nNICK (puzzled) What? \nThen Nick, remembering the headdress, rips it off his head and furiously tears it apart -- scattering a flurry of plastic feathers. He hurls what's left of it across the room. \nNICK Shit! \nSID (accusingly) You're too late. She's gone. \nNICK (angrily) I got that.

No one's home. He turns, leaning against the door for support, staring out at tract house neighborhood. \nNICK (spent) I'm too late... \nSuddenly he bolts for his car. \nNick yanks his car door open and disappears into it. In a second he emerges with the bottle of scotch. \nIt's empty. He eyes it for a moment then hurls it as far as he can down the street -- it shatters explosively. \nHe races to his front door and stops dead in his tracks at the open doorway. \nINT. NICK'S LIVING ROOM \nSid has covered the floor and remaining furniture with drop cloths and is applying even strokes to the ceiling with a long handled roller. \nNick steps in and stares at Sid and his own nearly empty drop-cloth covered home. \nNICK (at the top of his lungs) This really bothers me! \nSid stares at him. \nSID (after a moment, with mock politeness) Will you do me a favor? \nNICK (spitting out the word) What? \nSID Act normal. \nNick advances on Sid. \nNICK (adamantly) Listen! I don't want to be normal. I don't have to be, I don't! This is my house. You're in my house. And I'm tired of going to my house and finding strangers! \nThey're face to face in a stand-off. \nSID It's not your house. You're gone. I'm painting -- \nHe puts the long handled roller right in Nick's face. \nSID -- for the new people -- whose house it's going to be. (pause) You're gone. They're not here yet. I'm here. (calmly) I guess that makes this my house. \nNick ponders this logic, Sid's size, and the roller in his face. \nNICK (politely) May I look around? \nSID (w/ a stony politeness) Sure. Make yourself at home. \nNick wanders around the nearly empty room, then, after a beat... \n...he pulls a dropcloth off an object in the corner, revealing the television. \nNICK (dismayed) Nooo... she left the television. \nSID Yeah. \nCAROL He was nice to Beth when you treated her like shit. \nNick stares at her -- knowing what she says is true. \nNICK (protesting weakly) I came back... \nCAROL (busting him) Nick. This is me. You didn't come back for Beth's sake -- something just didn't work out like you had planned. \nNICK (defensively) You see -- you don't know everything about me -- I didn't really have any real plans! \nCAROL He was sweet to her. They were sweet with each other. \nNick stares at her. \nCAROL Beth looked young with him. They had a real connection. \nNICK (after a beat, dryly) And I brought them together? \nHe exhales loudly and holds his head in his hands. \nNICK It seems I'm blessed... in what I do. I do wrong, and it turns out right... that I've done right. So it really doesn't matter what I do. \nNick takes a deep breath. \nNICK Hey! \nSid ignores him. \nNICK (after a beat) I said \"hey!\" \nSid looks at him. \nNICK (flamboyantly sarcastic) I hope you're very happy together! \nSID She's gone. \nNICK (glancing to Carol, pointedly) She is, isn't she? (to Sid) If you two were such the happy couple why the fuck did she leave, Romeo? \nSID After three years with you, she wanted to be alone. \nNICK I was already gone! This is not about me and Beth, there is no me and Beth! This is about you! Why didn't you go with her? \nSID It wasn't offered. \nNICK (advancing on him) People aren't going to offer you anything! You have to take what you want. \nSID You can't take another person. They have to give themselves to you. \nNICK (in his face) That's very wise, but not very true. (relentlessly) I sell televisions. People don't know what they want. You have to show them. \nSID I couldn't show her. \nNICK Go after her! \nCAROL Leave him alone! \nNICK No. He's not alone, he's with us. She's alone. She's out there alone. (after a beat, quietly) Just hoping she's closer to what she wants... \nCAROL (sardonically) And what is that? \nNICK (exploding) I don't know! \nNick throws his arms in the air and storms up to Carol's face. \nNICK How would I know?! What do I know?! \nCarol doesn't flinch. He steps back. \nNICK (w/ a sweeping gesture) I know that what I want isn't there. (pointing to his chest) It isn't here. (gesturing wildly) It isn't inside! It isn't outside! (spent) It doesn't exist. \nHe turns on Sid. \nNICK (forcefully) But you want her, and you aren't doing shit about it! \nCAROL There isn't anything he can do. \nNICK He can go after her. (to Sid) Go after her! \nSID I can't. She... (torn) My life is here. \nNICK No... \nNick and Carol look to each other, at a loss. Nick looks back to the couple. \nNICK (improvising) We're your new neighbors. From next door. \nCarol throws him a look. \nMAN Well. (putting on a good face) It's nice to meet you. \nHe holds out his hand to shake. After an instant of awkward hesitation they all shake hands with too much enthusiasm. \nWOMAN (cheerfully, while shaking hands) It is... and it's so nice of you to greet us. \nCAROL Thank you. \nThey finish the handshakes -- there's an awkward pause. \nNICK Actually, we're here for the t.v. \nHe waits, half expecting this statement to be challenged. It isn't. \nNICK (confidently) The people who left here -- our old neighbors -- left us that t.v. \nThey all look at the t.v. \nMAN Oh. It's very nice. \nCAROL Yes. It is. \nThere's an awkward pause. \nCAROL (going to the t.v.) Well, dear... we should carry it home. \nNick and Carol lift the t.v. \nWOMAN Do you need help? \nNICK We can manage. \nThey move toward the front door, Carol going backwards. \nCAROL Thanks anyway. \nNick looks to make eye contact with Carol. He can't. She's looking back over her shoulder for obstacles. He smiles and glances toward the couple. \nNick and Carol go out the door, lugging the t.v. \nWOMAN (calling out) Nice meeting you. \nThe man and woman look at each other. They look around the room. \nMAN They're not done painting. \nWOMAN They'll finish. \nShe stares out the front door. \nWOMAN (whimsically) I wonder where our furniture is? \nShe looks back to him. He's staring at the ceiling. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS \nThey're lugging the t.v. across to Carol's -- Carol backing up and Nick going forward. They arrive at the front door. \nNick takes most of the weight of the t.v., while Carol fumbles with her key into her front door lock with her free hand. \nCAROL You're not going to be their new neighbor. \nNICK It was just something to say. \nCarol gets the door open. \nCAROL Good. \nCarol backs into the house, leading the way. \n", "test1_input": "\"BODIES, REST & MOTION\" \nScreenplay by \nRoger Hedden \nBased on a play by \nRoger Hedden \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nTHE SCREEN IS BLACK \nFADE IN: \nINT.

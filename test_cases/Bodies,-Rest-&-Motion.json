{"test1_input": "BETH (hushed) The moment's gone. \nSID (shaking his head) It can go on as long as we want. \nBeth leans him back, cradling him in her arms. She stares at him, a quizzical expression on her face. \nBETH (skeptically) Have you ever been in a relationship? \nSID No. (after a beat) I was married... but it wasn't really a relationship. \nBETH (incredulous) You weren't married... \nSID Two years. Right out of high school. \nBeth ponders this for a moment. \nBETH Do I remind you of her? \nSID No. \nBETH (relieved) Thank God. \nSid runs his hands over her body. \nSID You have beautiful skin... her skin was polka-dotted. \nBETH Freckled... \nSID When we were kids we called her \"Spot\". \nBETH (laughing) What happened? \nSID She disappeared. \nBeth looks to Sid. He's staring off. \nBETH (after a beat) Was she ever found? \nA flicker of loss crosses his face. \nSID No. Not by me... (looking to Beth) I didn't go look. \nBeth stares at him, uncertainly. He leans up and gently traces circles on Beth's skin. \nSID She wanted to meet someone new. I asked her \"why?\" -- she said, \"Because he won't know me from before. Just now. Just what I am now.\" \nBeth looks to him, puzzled. \nSID I knew her... on playgrounds... in Sunday School... all those grades -- I knew her as she changed. But she was still the same person. All the times I knew her, she was still her. (after a beat) She can't get away from that. \nHe holds Beth tightly. \nSID You stay in one place, and all those things that are you... are there. She didn't understand that if you leave, they're still there, in you -- but they stop being clear. You stop knowing who you are, and what you want. \nBETH You've stayed here and you know who you are? \nHe moves away from Beth. \nSID I see the lawns I mow, houses I've painted, faces I know... my parents... And I'm constantly reminded of who I am. \nBETH And you know what you want. \nSID I want you. \nBETH Oh. \nSID I want to be inside you. \nBETH Good. (after a beat) Come here and put it inside me. \nSID No... I want to be able to put myself inside of you. \nBETH Doing this is as close as you get. \nBeth pulls Sid close, bringing him into her. \nBETH Come here. \nSID I love you. \n", "test1_true": "BETH Come inside me. \nSid arches away from her. \nSID Beth? \nBETH Yes? \nSID What do you want? \nBETH (uncertainly) I want... I want... \nBeth pulls Sid back to her. \nBETH (w/ quiet urgency) Come inside me. \nThey hold each other tightly. \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. NICK'S SEDAN - NIGHT \nNick looks like hell -- his eyes red, his hair a mess. The nearly empty scotch bottle is on the dashboard. \nThe car windows are open, the roar of the wind competing with the blasting radio. \nNick suddenly jerks the wheel over. \nEXT. ABANDONED REST STOP - CONTINUOUS \nThe sedan screeches off the highway into the abandoned rest area. \nIt stops facing a battered phone booth -- the engine turns off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth. \nIN THE SEDAN \nNick turns off the radio. It is suddenly very quiet -- only the occasional lonely DRONE OF A TRUCK passing on the highway. He takes a deep breath. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER \nNick is standing in the phone booth, harshly lit by his headlights. \nNICK (into the phone) Could you give me the number for information in Arizona?... Thank you. \nNick dials with drunken concentration. \nNICK (into the phone) Enfield. Carol, Carol, umm... (mortified) Carol... Carol Something... Shit! \nHe hangs up. He hits himself in the head in angry disbelief. He hurriedly dials zero and listens for a moment, desperately summoning up all his salesman charm. \nNICK (into the phone) Hello Janet, thank you for being my operator. I hope you can help me, I need to call my home. \nNick listens impatiently. \nNICK Well, I'll tell you my number, but there's a problem. My phone's been disconnected, not because of bills, I mean we paid all our bills. We were hardly ever even late. We were very good customers, but we're moving, so we had the phone disconnected. But now I need to call... the woman I live with. She's still there and I've got to let her know where I am. \nNick listens, shaking his head emphatically. \nNICK I don't know any of the neighbors. I know one, but I can't remember her last name. (he listens, frustrated) No. No. No. You see you have to be able to help me, this is not a prank, it's my home phone, this is an emergency. (he listens, then urgently) Yes it can, it can be done. Someone there can hook the phone back up. It's not like a phone guy came to our house to disconnect the phone, nobody came to our house, someone just flipped a switch somewhere, somewhere there where you work, or plugged something into a computer and our phone stopped working! (he listens) They turned it off, they can turn it back on! (he listens, starting to panic) I know it's the week-end! I know! Call them at home! They'll have a computer at their house, they'll have a phone thing to hook it up to the real computer! That's how these people live! They'll be glad to do it!... \nNick listens. Suddenly all his energy drains away. \nNICK (crestfallen) No. No. I can't have the police go to the house. That won't work, there are circumstances. (desperately) It's you... you've got to help me! Please! I've gotta call home! I can't wait. It could be too late! Janet!! You've gotta help me! Please! You can reconnect me. Please!! Don't hang up! Don't hang up!! \nHe hurls the receiver at the phone. \nNICK You fucker!! You heartless... \nNick doubles over, retching, clutching the side of the booth. \nTELEPHONE RECORDING \"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help...\" \nCUT TO BLACK: \nFADE IN: \nINT. BETH'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nSid is sprawled out over the bed, sleeping, Beth nestled against him. She stirs and cuddles closer. \n", "test1_id": 3042, "test2_input": "NICK (puzzled) What? \nThen Nick, remembering the headdress, rips it off his head and furiously tears it apart -- scattering a flurry of plastic feathers. He hurls what's left of it across the room. \nNICK Shit! \nSID (accusingly) You're too late. She's gone. \nNICK (angrily) I got that. Where'd she go? \nSID She didn't say. \nNICK Shit! \nSID (bitterly) She didn't know. \nNick runs out the front door. \nEXT. NICK'S FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS \nNick runs out into his lawn. \nNICK (running; under his breath) Be at Carol's... be at Carol's... \nThe CAMERA FOLLOWING he races up to Carol's front door and leans on the doorbell -- a loud tight buzzing. \nHe pounds on the door, then stops, gasping for breath. No one's home. He turns, leaning against the door for support, staring out at tract house neighborhood. \nNICK (spent) I'm too late... \nSuddenly he bolts for his car. \nNick yanks his car door open and disappears into it. In a second he emerges with the bottle of scotch. \nIt's empty. He eyes it for a moment then hurls it as far as he can down the street -- it shatters explosively. \nHe races to his front door and stops dead in his tracks at the open doorway. \nINT. NICK'S LIVING ROOM \nSid has covered the floor and remaining furniture with drop cloths and is applying even strokes to the ceiling with a long handled roller. \nNick steps in and stares at Sid and his own nearly empty drop-cloth covered home. \nNICK (at the top of his lungs) This really bothers me! \nSid stares at him. \nSID (after a moment, with mock politeness) Will you do me a favor? \nNICK (spitting out the word) What? \nSID Act normal. \nNick advances on Sid. \nNICK (adamantly) Listen! I don't want to be normal. I don't have to be, I don't! This is my house. You're in my house. And I'm tired of going to my house and finding strangers! \nThey're face to face in a stand-off. \nSID It's not your house. You're gone. I'm painting -- \nHe puts the long handled roller right in Nick's face. \nSID -- for the new people -- whose house it's going to be. (pause) You're gone. They're not here yet. I'm here. (calmly) I guess that makes this my house. \nNick ponders this logic, Sid's size, and the roller in his face. \nNICK (politely) May I look around? \nSID (w/ a stony politeness) Sure. Make yourself at home. \nNick wanders around the nearly empty room, then, after a beat... \n...he pulls a dropcloth off an object in the corner, revealing the television. \nNICK (dismayed) Nooo... she left the television. \nSID Yeah. \n", "test2_true": "SID (pointedly) She didn't seem to want it. \nNICK That's foolish. That t.v. is a remarkable thing. \nThey both stare at the television. \nThe sweep of HEADLIGHTS turning into the driveway cross their faces. They both race to the door. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS \nCarol gets out of her car. Nick hurries toward her. \nCAROL (flatly) You came back. \nNICK (a little chagrined) Yeah. \nCAROL Is Beth here? \nNICK No. Do you know where she went? \nCAROL No. \nNICK Shit. \nCAROL You're too late. \nSID (from the doorway) She's gone. \nNICK (to Carol, exasperated) Who is this guy? \nCAROL (walking past him toward the house) Beth's new boyfriend. \nNICK (exploding) What?! \nCAROL (stopping) You heard me. \nNICK (to Sid) Is this true?! \nSID Not really. \nHe turns and walks back into the house. \nNICK (to Carol) Not really? \nHe races after Sid. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSid is painting the ceiling. Nick bursts through the door. \nNICK (to Sid) Not really?! What? (w/ \"say it ain't so\" attitude) Did you fuck her? \nSID I don't tell. \nNICK Jesus! The next day! (bitterly disillusioned) That's the world, huh? They don't even wait a day anymore. \nCAROL (stepping in the doorway) You left her. \nNICK (defensively) I didn't fuck anyone. \nCAROL (witheringly) You didn't find anyone. \nNICK (hurt) No... I didn't leave her for another person, I left her for another place. (pause) Which I think is a little more excusable. \nSID I don't. \nNICK Well it's none of your fuckin' business! \nSID (threateningly) I think it is. \nNICK Cause you fucked her? No! That gives you no business in my life. \nSID If you hadn't gone, I'd be done by now. I'd be home. \nNICK Be glad you have a home, asshole! \nCAROL Let it drop, Nick! \nNICK (outraged) Why?! \n", "test2_id": 3043, "test3_input": "CAROL He was nice to Beth when you treated her like shit. \nNick stares at her -- knowing what she says is true. \nNICK (protesting weakly) I came back... \nCAROL (busting him) Nick. This is me. You didn't come back for Beth's sake -- something just didn't work out like you had planned. \nNICK (defensively) You see -- you don't know everything about me -- I didn't really have any real plans! \nCAROL He was sweet to her. They were sweet with each other. \nNick stares at her. \nCAROL Beth looked young with him. They had a real connection. \nNICK (after a beat, dryly) And I brought them together? \nHe exhales loudly and holds his head in his hands. \nNICK It seems I'm blessed... in what I do. I do wrong, and it turns out right... that I've done right. So it really doesn't matter what I do. \nNick takes a deep breath. \nNICK Hey! \nSid ignores him. \nNICK (after a beat) I said \"hey!\" \nSid looks at him. \nNICK (flamboyantly sarcastic) I hope you're very happy together! \nSID She's gone. \nNICK (glancing to Carol, pointedly) She is, isn't she? (to Sid) If you two were such the happy couple why the fuck did she leave, Romeo? \nSID After three years with you, she wanted to be alone. \nNICK I was already gone! This is not about me and Beth, there is no me and Beth! This is about you! Why didn't you go with her? \nSID It wasn't offered. \nNICK (advancing on him) People aren't going to offer you anything! You have to take what you want. \nSID You can't take another person. They have to give themselves to you. \nNICK (in his face) That's very wise, but not very true. (relentlessly) I sell televisions. People don't know what they want. You have to show them. \nSID I couldn't show her. \nNICK Go after her! \nCAROL Leave him alone! \nNICK No. He's not alone, he's with us. She's alone. She's out there alone. (after a beat, quietly) Just hoping she's closer to what she wants... \nCAROL (sardonically) And what is that? \nNICK (exploding) I don't know! \nNick throws his arms in the air and storms up to Carol's face. \nNICK How would I know?! What do I know?! \nCarol doesn't flinch. He steps back. \nNICK (w/ a sweeping gesture) I know that what I want isn't there. (pointing to his chest) It isn't here. (gesturing wildly) It isn't inside! It isn't outside! (spent) It doesn't exist. \nHe turns on Sid. \nNICK (forcefully) But you want her, and you aren't doing shit about it! \nCAROL There isn't anything he can do. \nNICK He can go after her. (to Sid) Go after her! \nSID I can't. She... (torn) My life is here. \n", "test3_true": "He stares at Sid. \nCAROL He wouldn't know where to look. \nNICK (groping) She'd she'd she'd... (triumphant) She'd head for her parents! \nCAROL What? \nNICK She'd head for her parents. Believe me. (pause, then flatly) They're in Florida. That's east. \nNick stares at Sid, waiting. \nSID I... \nNICK (businesslike) You start driving east on route forty. Keep going east and around eleven start checking every roadside motel. The budget ones... You do that all night, you'll find her. \nCAROL How do you know she's on the highway? \nNICK When you don't know where you're going, you drive on the highway. \nSid looks to Carol, then around the drop cloth covered room. \nNICK (cheerfully) I'll finish painting. \nSID (to Carol) Do I have a chance? \nNick and Sid both look to Carol. \nCAROL (after a beat, shaking her head) You've got a chance. \nSID (determined) Then I'm gone. \nSid races out the door. \nNick tosses a self-satisfied smile at Carol and walks past her to the door. \nSOUND \nSid's truck engine roars to life. \nNICK'S POV \nSid peels out, driving up onto the lawn past Nick and Carol's cars, out onto the street and out of sight. \nTHE DOORWAY \nCarol steps into the doorway beside Nick. \nCAROL So. (dryly) Start painting. \nNick looks back into the room. \nNICK (after a beat) Fuck the ceiling. (walking in) Who looks up that often? \nCarol follows him into the room. Nick slumps on the sofa, staring at the blank t.v. \nMAN'S VOICE (happily) This is it! \nA MAN and a WOMAN, both slightly portly Mexican-Americans in their late forties, wearing their Sunday best, step over the threshold and kiss. \nThe man is carrying the woman cradled in his arms. \nCAROL (politely) Hello...? \nMAN (surprised, breaking the kiss) Oh. Hello. \nThe four stare at each other in awkward silence, the woman still cradled in the man's arms. \nMAN I'm sorry. We thought it was going to be empty. \nNICK (flatly) It is. \nWOMAN (cheerfully) We're here to move in. \nThe man puts her down on her feet. \nWOMAN Are you the couple moving out? \nCAROL No. \n", "test3_id": 3044}

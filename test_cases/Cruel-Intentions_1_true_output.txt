SEBASTIAN (indifferent) Some other time, Cecile. 
He leaves the room. Cecile looks confused. A moment passes and Sebastian re-enters taking off his clothes. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What am I, an idiot? 
Cecile smiles. 
63   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63 
Sebastian and Cecile lie in bed. Sebastian smokes a cigarette and writes in his journal. 
CECILE Am I suppose to be this sore? 
SEBASTIAN For the first time, yes. It'll pass. 
A moment of silence. 
CECILE I like it better when I'm on top. 
SEBASTIAN Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done. 
CECILE I'm sorry. 
She looks at the troubled expression on Sebastian's face. 
CECILE (cont'd) Something's bothering you? 
SEBASTIAN You think? 
CECILE Is it me? 
SEBASTIAN No, you were fine. 
SEBASTIAN'S P.O.V. - He looks out on the balcony, where Kathryn is eavesdropping. They make eye contact and she waves. 
CECILE It's that girl, Annette. 
He stands and walks over to the balcony, where he closes the blinds. 
CECILE (cont'd) You love her, don't you? It's okay. I don't love you either. I love Ronald. 
SEBASTIAN I'm getting out of here. 
Sebastian heads to the bathroom. 
CECILE Where are you going? 
SEBASTIAN (O.S.) I'm taking a shower. 
CECILE Need any company? 
SEBASTIAN (O.S.) No. 
CECILE Want a blow job? 
SEBASTIAN (O.S.) Good night Cecile. 
CECILE (under her breath) Prude. 
64   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 64 
Annette is reading in bed. There's a knock on the door. 
ANNETTE Come in. 
Sebastian enters the room. 
SEBASTIAN I just came to say goodbye. 
ANNETTE Where are you going? 
SEBASTIAN Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here. 
ANNETTE I think that's for the best. 
SEBASTIAN Good for you. 
ANNETTE Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms. 
SEBASTIAN Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.

A young man is approaching down the boardwalk from the beach, carrying fins, a mask, a snorkel. He's in his early twenties: blond, crew-cut, very tall. His name is MATHIAS. As he nears the pool, he stops, staring. 
MATHIAS'S POV - THE POOL Eric and Stacy have risen to join Jeff and Amy; they're all peering into the water. Amy holds her remaining earring out to Eric and Stacy, showing them what it looks like. 
BACK TO SCENE - MATHIAS He stands there, hesitating. Then he starts forward. 
MATHIAS'S POV - THROUGH THE MASK - UNDERWATER - DAY We glide just above the pool's pale blue bottom. A silver earring comes into view. Mathias's hand reaches for it. 
EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - DAY 
The two couples have spread out around the pool's edge, searching for the earring. Mathias surfaces in front of Amy. He holds out his hand, with the earring-in it; she stares, startled, then crouches to take it. 
AMY Thank you so much. .Mathias nods. He starts to turn, as if to swim off, but Jeff stops him: 
JEFF Wait. . .want a beer? He waves toward their chairs, the cooler beside them. 
EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - LATER 
Mathias and the two couples sit together, with their beers. Amy's skin has turned deep red; Stacy is behind her, applying lotion to her shoulders. Eric is talking to Mathias: 
ERIC We went sailing yesterday. Out toward Cozumel? And there were these seven foot fish, these huge-- 
JEFF Nurse sharks. 
ERIC (he nods) Like thirty of them. A whole, you know, flock. 
JEFF School. 
ERIC The water was, I don't know, ten feet deep? And they were lying on the bottom, just waiting for somebody to come swimming by-- 
JEFF They're not dangerous. Eric turns, stares at Jeff. 
ERIC You said they're sharks. 
JEFF But they're not dangerous. They eat lobsters. Sea urchins. That sort of thing. Eric considers this, frowning. Then he takes a sip of beer. He shrugs, turns back toward Mathias. 
ERIC I wouldn't be snorkeling on my own.' That's all I'm saying. 
When Mathias speaks, it's with a SLIGHT GERMAN ACCENT: 
MATHIAS I wasn't on my own. I was with my brother. Jeff glances around the pool. 
JEFF He's here? Mathias shakes his head. 
MATHIAS He met a girl. They went away. 
JEFF To? 
MATHIAS It's a complicated story. They watch him, waiting for more, but nothing comes. Finally: 
ERIC You should hang with us, then. If you're on your own. (he glances at the others) Right? Everyone nods, smiling. Eric reaches into the cooler, pulls out another beer, holds it toward Mathias. 
EXT. CANCUN BEACH - NIGHT 
There's a DJ, a dozen beer kegs. A few young men and women are dancing beside a bonfire, but most of the crowd is scattered in small groups across the sand, TALKING, drinking, the firelight flickering off their faces. Stacy, Amy, Eric, Jeff and Mathias are sitting together; they all have cups of beer. Stacy is between Eric's legs, leaning against his chest. Amy, Jeff and Mathias sit cross-legged. Everyone but Jeff and Mathias is a little drunk, and you can hear it in their voices. Amy drains her cup, stands up, very unsteadily. She holds out her hand to Jeff.

SELINA You know, I've got a great recipe for Sliced Bitch -- 
VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island.  While they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her claws.  VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow: CLANG. 
VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA with knives and appliances.  It buys her enough time to make for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her.  Another downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in the wood. 
VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose. 
INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER 
SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI. 
SELINA I love a good old-fashioned catfight -- but this is pissing me off. 
VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED COCKTAIL CART before her.  It SLAMS full-force into SELINA, who lands on her back on the great long dining table.  VICKI is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER 
VICKI races up the stairs.  She has a good lead, but SELINA makes up the difference in a hurry.  She takes the stairway in three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her and LOCKING IT. 
SELINA HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty kitty... 
She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN. 
INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT 
SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door behind her.  VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading to a balcony, but it's too long a drop.  She stands there paralyzed as SELINA advances. 
SELINA So this is where you earn your keep. 
She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves her roughly back onto the bed.  VICKI flails wildly as SELINA kneels atop her... 
SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly section of bra -- 
SELINA Mmm!  Frederick's of Gotham? 
She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's belly.  Now VICKI just loses it.  She begins to SHRIEK uncontrollably. 
SELINA Not so loud, honey!  The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. (laughing) Santa's coming.  Time for all good girls to go to sleep... 
She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's neck.  But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes wide-eyed and shuts up.  A BLACK SHADOW falls across the moonlit bed.  SELINA tenses -- 
-- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair -- 
BATMAN Miss me, "Angel"? 
He yanks her bodily off the bed.  Before she knows what's happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT.  She flies into the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges. 
INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER 
BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself up. 
SELINA Okay -- let's do it, huh?  You and me... all the way this time. 
She HISSES and jumps him.  They grapple -- a quick flurry of fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long stairway. 
She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner. BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time... 
INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER 
VICKI rushes out of the bedroom.  She looks down the hall and sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN -- slamming into the wall opposite.  He slumps to the carpet, out cold. 
A moment later DICK strolls out.  VICKI rushes to his side -- 
VICKI Come on.  We'll be safe in the cave. 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER 
BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is slightly ajar.  He pushes it in cautiously... 
...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing down mere inches from his face.  It's the PENGUIN wielding the ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him. But then -- 
-- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again. It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a good workout in the next thirty seconds. 
BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into SELINA's ribs.  It's a crippling blow; she flies backward, knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES, knocking over another -- and another -- 
-- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over, domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the cowering PENGUIN. 
SELINA is badly hurt now.  She makes it out of a rear door to the armory.  BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA. 
SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around enough to dig himself out. 
INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER 
As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the LIBRARY.  VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a bottom drawer.  A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open... 
INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT 
As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to DICK: 
VICKI Come on.  Come with us. 
DICK No.  I can still help...

CALEB What's the problem, Nathan? 
NATHAN My card.    I've lost it. 
A beat. 
Then CALEB reaches down. Beside where NATHAN lies.    And picks something up from the floor. 
CALEB It's right here. 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB enters his bedroom. 
Shuts the door. 
AVA is on the TV.    Sat alone in the observation room. 
CALEB looks at her. 
She looks at him. 
He switches the TV off. 
Lies on the bed.    On his back. 
Stares at the ceiling. CUT TO - 
FLASHCUT IMAGES. 
Of KYOKO removing her skin. 
CUT BACK TO - 
- CALEB. 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB enters the bathroom. 
He goes to the sink. 
He looks at his own reflection. 
Deep into his own eyes. 
Opens his mouth.    Looks inside. 
Feels his wrist for his pulse. 
Feels his skin on the same seam where KYOKO opened herself. 
Pauses. 
Then picks up his disposable plastic razor. 
And breaks it. 
Forcing it with his hand against the porcelain of the sink. 
Snapping the plastic. 
Popping out the tiny razor blade. 
A beat. 
Then he picks up the blade between his thumb and forefinger. 
Places it against his forearm. 
And cuts. 
Blood runs out. 
CALEB watches it. 
Sees the way droplets hit the white sink. The way they expand, and merge with existing water droplets. 
Then he switches the tap on, and puts his arm under the flow. 
The water clears away the blood, revealing the cut. 
CALEB pulls open at the slice with his fingers, spreading it. Revealing no carbon fibre.   Only muscle. 
He exhales. 
And glances up at the mirror, and his own reflection. 
Then... 
... reaches up his forearm, and very deliberately wipes blood across the glass. 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT 
On the monitors in NATHAN'S study, the live feed of CALEB'S bathroom is partially obscured as CALEB smears the two-way mirror. 
Then, through the blood, we see him pull his fist back. 
And punch the glass. 
As it shatters, the feed goes dead. 
Only now REVEAL - 
- that the person watching the monitor is KYOKO. 
Her expression is unreadable. 
Through the glass of the indoor garden, NATHAN lies on the sheets, crashed out.

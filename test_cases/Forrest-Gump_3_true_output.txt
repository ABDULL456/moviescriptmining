LT. DAN Ho! Get your hands down. Do not salute me. There are goddamned snipers all around this area who would love to grease an officer. I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fourth Platoon. 
Lt. Dan looks at Bubba. 
LT. DAN What's wrong with your lips? 
BUBBA I was born with big gums, sir. 
LT. DAN Yeah, well, you better tuck that in. Gonna get that caught on a trip wire. Where you boys from in the world? 
BUBBA & FORREST Alabama, sir! 
LT. DAN You twins? 
Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, they don't get the joke. 
FORREST No, we are not relations, sir. 
LT. DAN Look, it's pretty basic here. 
Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear and follow him. 
LT. DAN You stick with me, you learn from the guys who been in country awhile, you'll be right. There is one item of G.I. gear that can be the difference between a live grunt and a dead grunt. 
Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys. 
LT. DAN Socks, cushion, sole, O.D. green. Try and keep your feet dry when we're out humpin'. I want you boys to remember to change your socks wherever we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet right off his legs. 
Lt. Dan steps over to a large black soldier named SERGEANT SIMS. 
LT. DAN Sergeant Sims! Goddamnit, where is that sling-rope I told you to order. 
SGT. SIMS I put in requisitions at Battalion. 
LT. DAN Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those sonabitches again, call them again and again and again. I don't care how much it takes... 
FORREST (V.O.) Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant. He was from a long, great military tradition. Somebody in his family had fought and died in every single American war. 
EXT. VALLEY FORGE/THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR - DAY (1778) 
A distant relative of Lt. Dan's, wearing a revolutionary war uniform, falls dead in the snow. 
EXT. GETTYSBURG/THE CIVIL WAR - DAY (1863) 
Another relative, wearing a civil war uniform and bearing a striking resemblance to Lt. Dan, falls down dead. 
EXT. NORMANDY/WORLD WAR II - DAY (1944) 
Another relative, wearing a World War II, falls down dead on the beach at Normandy. 
EXT. VETNAM/MEKONG DELTA/FIREBASE - DAY (1967) 
LT. DAN Goddamnit, kick some ass! 
SGT. SIMS I'm on it, Lieutenant. 
LT. DAN Get on it! 
Lt. Dan steps back up to Bubba and Forrest. 
FORREST (V.O.) I guess you could say he had a lot to live up to. 
Lt. Dan walks along the walkway and Bubba and Forrest follow. 
LT. DAN So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh? Well, I've been through there. Little Rock's a fine town. Now, go shake down your gear, see the platoon sergeant, draw what you need for the field. 
Lt. Dan steps inside the latrine, still holding the roll of toilet paper. 
LT. DAN If you boys are hungry, we got steaks burnin' right here. 
Lt. Dan sits down out of sight in the latrine, then stands up, looking at the boys. 
LT. DAN Two standing orders in this platoon. One, take good care of your feet. Two, try not to do anything stupid, like gettin' yourself killed. 
Lt. Dan sits back down out of sight in the latrine. Bubba and Forrest look at each other. 
FORREST I sure hope I don't let him down. 
EXT. RICE FIELD - ANOTHER DAY 
Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon walk across the rice field. Some Vietnamese rice farmers are working as the soldiers walk past. 
FORREST (V.O.) I got to see a lot of countryside. We would take these real long walks. 
EXT. JUNGLE/DIRT ROAD - ANOTHER DAY 
Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road. 
SONG And we were always lookin' for this guy named Charlie. I can't get no relief. 
Suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, a signal for the unit to stop. He motions for them to get down. 
LT. DAN Hold it up! 
SGT. SIMS Hold up, boys!

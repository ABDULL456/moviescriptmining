ROB I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later. 
LAURA It'll have to be sex, then. 
She pulls herself over him, staddling him in the passenger seat and kissing his neck.  She pauses and regards him from above. 
LAURA Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here. 
ROB Hi. 
LAURA I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today. 
Laura reaches down and unzips his pants, as they keep kissing. 
ROB You know, with Ray... 
LAURA Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again. 
ROB No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill? 
LAURA Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about. 
ROB I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used? 
Laura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry. 
ROB Look, we can do other things. 
LAURA I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad? 
She rolls off of him into her seat.  They sit there in silence, watching the rain run down the windshield.

ROB Later, I wonder if I was really worried about where Ian has been.  I have no idea where he's been, and that gives me every right to insist on protection.  But in truth, it was the power that interested me more than the fear.  I wanted to hurt her, on this day of all days, just because it's the first time since she's left that I've been able to. 
INT. BAR - LATER 
Rob and Laura lean back in a booth, facing each other.  We get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since we last saw them. 
ROB Laura... 
LAURA I'm too tired not to go out with you. 
Rob leans forward. 
ROB So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together. 
LAURA (nodding) Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't. 
ROB What about Ian? 
LAURA Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart. 
ROB Mission accomplished. 
LAURA I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so... 
She looks up at him. 
LAURA Let's go home.  Okay? 
ROB Okay.

ROB But wouldn't you know it?  Suddenly I feel panicky, and sick, and I want to run around and sleep with female recording artists...

INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Post-lovemaking.  Rob and Laura lie on their backs. 
ROB C'mon.  I want to know.

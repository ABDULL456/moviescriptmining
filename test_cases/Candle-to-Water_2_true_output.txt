Vaughn waits a moment. He takes a deep breath. The world seems to crowd in on him. He presses the call `accept' button. 
VAUGHN Mia. Hi honey. 
MIA OS (phone filter) Mia? Who's she? It's late. Pip wants a goodnight kiss. Where are you? Vaughn?

Vaughn sits in the conservatory and drinks his morning tea. His gaze out into the garden is broken by something in the cup, in the tea, that gets his attention. Troubled and preoccupied, he frowns as he looks at the tea in the tea cup. 
His daughter PIP (8) rushes into the conservatory in her pyjamas and throws herself on him 足 her beloved, wonderful

What the fuck is wrong with you? 
4|Page Vaughn grunts something, then goes to help her; but it's half hearted. He can barely remember where the cereal goes. 
MIA Wrong time of the month? 
Vaughn laughs slightly too loudly. Still no eye contact. His mind elsewhere, he helps her put the shopping away. 
Mia takes a deep breath to control herself. 
MIA Don't worry. Seriously.

I love you with every fibre. To the end.

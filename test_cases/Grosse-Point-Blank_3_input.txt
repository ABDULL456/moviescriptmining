SOUTHTEC GUARD Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer. 
The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back. 
MARTIN So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me. 
SOUTHTEC GUARD To shoot you. Correct. 
MARTIN How did you get this job? 
SOUTHTEC GUARD Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course... 
MARTIN (pleasantly) Wow. 
Paul walks the happy couple down the steps. 
PAUL (to couple) ...What more can I say. 
HUSBAND (smiling) We'll talk soon. 
PAUL (much hand gesturing) You'll be raising your new family in a work of art. A work of art in a work of art. 
Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the sell. 
SOUTHTEC GUARD I'm sure you'll be very happy. 
All look to Martin.... 
MARTIN (heartfelt) When my time comes, if it ever does, I want a beautiful, normal place like this... and a wife like you... 
All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard. 
MARTIN ...and you'll be safe here... 
Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders. 
EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE 
Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house in the distance. 
INT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER 
Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming neighborhood. 
PAUL Now. I don't make a habit of pimping my friends, but there is one prime little piece of land that you must see... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. 
A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the house. 
MARTIN (V.O.) Debi's house. 
PAUL (V.O.) Kind of crept up on you, didn't it? 
C.U. OF MARTIN 
MARTIN No. You drove us here. 
PAUL Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it? 
MARTIN No. 
Martin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the window. 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. 
of the mansion. 
They roll slowly by Debi's house. 
They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin.

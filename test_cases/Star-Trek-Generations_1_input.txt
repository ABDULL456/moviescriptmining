PICARD You know, Counselor... I'm not getting any younger. For some time now, I've been aware that there are fewer days ahead than there are behind... (beat) But I always took comfort in the fact that when I was gone, my family would continue. But now... 
Picard moves back to the photo album, open it to the last page, an then flips through the remaining pages -- they are blank. 
PICARD I've had brushes with death... more than I care to contemplate. I always accepted it as a calculated risk that goes along with wearing this uniform. (beat) But now... the idea of death has a terrible sense of finality to it. 
He looks at her. 
PICARD I'm the last Picard. 
A quiet beat as Troi considers him. 
TROI Captain, perhaps we -- 
Suddenly, a BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT  from outside the windows washes into the room. Troi and Picard rush to the window and shield their eyes against the glare. 
RIKER'S COM VOICE Red Alert! All hands to duty stations! 
CUT TO: 
THRU    OMITTED                                                   THRU 
69    INT. BRIDGE (VFX-I)                                         69 
Picard and Troi ENTER from a turbolift. Riker and Worf at their stations. The star is on the Viewscreen, getting DARKER by the second... more flaming debris is being ejected into space. 
PICARD Report. 
RIKER A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclear fusion is breaking down. 
PICARD How is that possible? 
WORF Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago. 
RIKER The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes. 
Something beeps on Worf's console. 
WORF Sir, the implosion has produced a level twelve shock wave. 
TROI (shocked) Level twelve? That'll destroy everything in this system. 
TRANSPORTER COM VOICE Transporter room to Bridge. I can't locate Commander La Forge or Mister Data, sir. 
RIKER (to Worf) Did they return to the ship? 
WORF (works) No, sir. They are not aboard. 
PICARD How long until the shock wave hits the observatory? 
WORF Four minutes, forty seconds. 
Picard looks at Riker, who then quickly heads for the turbolift. 
RIKER Mister Worf. 
Riker and Worf EXIT. 
70   EXT. SPACE- THE STAR (VFX-I)                                70 
The star is almost entirely dark. Radiating out from the star is a huge shock wave- a rapidly growing sphere of energy. 
71   INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P)                         71 
Soran is standing at a console watching a graphic depiction of the star's collapse on a monitor when the door suddenly opens. Soran whirls around and FIRES his phaser at Riker and Worf. They dive for cover just outside the room. (NOTE: The probe Geordi examined earlier is now gone.) 
RIKER (to Worf) What the hell's he doing? 
Worf dodges another phaser blast and sees Geordi lying unconscious on the deck. Data is nowhere to be seen. 
PICARD'S COM VOICE Enterprise to Commander Riker, you have two minutes left. 
RIKER (yells to Soran) Soran, did you hear that? There's a level twelve shock wave coming. We've got to get out of here! 
Soran's only answer is another phaser blast. 
71A   OMITTED                                                    71A 
72  INT. BRIDGE                                                 72 
As before. ENSIGN HAYES is at Tactical. An ALARM suddenly BEEPS on the Tactical console. 
HAYES (urgent) Sir. A Klingon Bird of Prey is decloaking off the port bow.

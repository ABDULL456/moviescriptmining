NICO (to Sara,                                      * allowing himself to be frisked) It's all a mistake, Sara -- It's                      * gonna be all right. The cops steer Nico toward the door. 
SARA                                    * (calls after them) The Police Association's got lawyers for this, you bastards! 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                            57. 
Sara grabs for the phone; Nico is manhandled out the            * door -- 
212   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT 
The neighbors are now on their porches.   Nico is led to a waiting unmarked car. 
CUT TO: 
213   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - LATE NIGHT Bad Dude, the bartender we remember from Nico's first visit to the Polish bar, finishes signing a deposition. A cop takes the paper. Bad Dude stands, glances half- fearfully, half-defiantly to Nico, who is led down a hall- way flanked by two uniformed officers. Agent Halloran opens the door for Bad Dude, who exits. 
214   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATE NIGHT Neeley, Halloran, Lieutenant Strozah and Deputy Superinten-     * dent JACK CROWDER. Halloran indicates a stack of                * depositions, tapes and notes on the table before Nico. AGENT HALLORAN Illegal wiretaps. Unauthorized surveillance. NICO When were you born, asshole? AGENT NEELEY                             * Associating with known felons. Disobeying direct orders -- 
NICO Where's Jackson? 
CROWDER                                  * She's outa this. AGENT HALLORAN You're the rotten apple in this barrel, Toscani. We don't have to look any farther than you and your 'family.' 
Nico comes out of his chair, going for Halloran.      Strozah tries to block him, but it's useless. LIEUTENANT STROZAH                       * Nico! You damn fool! You wanna go to prison?! Nico stops. He's speechless with rage.    His finger points toward Halloran like a loaded gun. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           58. 
CROWDER                               * (indicates more depositions) Unlawful entry. Illegal search and seizure -- NICO (spits on papers) You'll never build a frame on this chickenshit. AGENT NEELEY                          * (angrily) You were ordered to back off on Salvano. But you had too big a hard-on for that, didn't you-- 
Nico contains his fury. He steps away from Strozah, with a gesture that says "I won't hurt you." NICO (to Strozah) Fred.   You can't be in on this. Nico faces his lieutenant -- a look that calls on long       * years of comradeship and loyalty. Strozah is torn. He's a good man, over his head in a situation he doesn't com- pletely understand. LIEUTENANT STROZAH                    * You're officially suspended, Toscani. I want your tin... and your iron. Neeley leans past Nico; drops Nico's gun (with an evidence   * tag on it) onto the table. Nico looks to Strozah, who averts his eyes. Nico flips his badge onto the table. NICO You holding me? 
AGENT NEELEY                          * You can walk for now. But don't walk far. 
CUT TO: 215   EXT. PHONE BOOTH ON DOWNTOWN STREET - DAWN

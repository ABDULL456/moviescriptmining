EXT. HOUSE 
Someone is standing there in the shadows. 
KILLER(O.C.) HI. Annette? 
It's a WOMAN'S VOICE. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT.  HOUSE 
Annette has never seen this woman before. WE still don't see the killer's face. 
ANNETTE (suspicious) Yeah? 
KILLER(O.C.) I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you. 
ANNETTE Why? 
KILLER(O.C.) He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school. 
ANNETTE (really angry) He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating. 
KILLER(O.C.) I think I know how to restore your reputation. 
ANNETTE (excited) You do? 
KILLER(O.C.) Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone. 
Annette isn't sure what to do but this is too important to pass up. 
ANNETTE Sure. 
Annette unlocks the chain. The killer heads inside. 
THE DOOR OMINOUSLY closes behind them.

Wine is being poured into already half-filled glasses. 
Annette's parents and the other couple are now a little tipsy, much looser than when we saw them earlier. They are laughing, rubbing each other, getting physical. 
The other HUSBAND leans in and kisses Annette's' mother on the nose. Annette's father is at first taken aback but then he responds by kissing the other WIFE on the ear. They all laugh. It's getting fancy for Cherry Falls.

Annette picks up the telephone. it's dead. 
The killer kicks the door a couple of times.

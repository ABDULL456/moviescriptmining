FERGUS He's hot. 
JUDE Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up. 
JODY Have you no feelings, woman? 
JUDE You shut your face -- 
She pulls the hood down over him. 
JUDE You're heading for trouble, Fergus -- 
JODY He's a good soldier, Jude. 
She whacks him with a pistol. 
JUDE I said shut the fuck up -- 
JODY He believes in the future -- 
INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. 
Jody, sitting in the hood. Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's mouth, with blood now in his lips. 
FERGUS Is it bad? 
JODY No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus? 
FERGUS I didn't. 
JODY Some kinds of women are... 
FERGUS She can't help it. 
JODY Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all. 
FERGUS You liked her? 
JODY Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too? 
FERGUS Don't know her. 
JODY Want you to do something, Fergus. 
FERGUS What? 
JODY If they kill me -- 
FERGUS Don't think that way. 
JODY But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her. 
Fergus is moved. He can't reply. 
JODY See if she's all right. 
FERGUS I don't know her. 
JODY Take her picture. C'mere. 
Fergus walks toward him. 
JODY Take it. In the inside pocket. 
Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her picture. 
JODY Take the whole lot. I won't need it. 
FERGUS I told you not to talk that way -- 
JODY Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking -- 
FERGUS Stop it -- 
The door opens. Maguire is there, with another. 
MAGUIRE Volunteer? 
Fergus turns toward him. 
MAGUIRE We need you inside. 
Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward, takes his seat. Fergus, unseen by Maguire, puts the wallet in his pocket. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

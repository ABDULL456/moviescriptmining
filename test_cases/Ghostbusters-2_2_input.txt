STANTZ (TO CAMERA) So don't wait another minute.  Make your supernatural problem our supernatural problem. Call now, because we're still -- 
ALL (in unison, mechanically) -- Ready to believe you.

INT.  JACK HARDEMEYER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Hardemeyer is watching the Ghostbusters commercial on a TV in his office. He bangs his fist on his desk and angrily switches OFF the TV.

EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY (LATER) 
The garage door opens and the new improved ECTOMOBILE comes ROARING out onto the street, its ghostly SIREN MOANING and WAILING.  Louis comes running out after it. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY 
Louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor. He sniffs around, following the smell. 
LOUIS Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really big -- 
He freezes. 
INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV 
Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing down Louis's bag lunch.  Slimer looks up and sees Louis. 
SLIMER AND LOUIS 
They both scream and run off in opposite directions. 
SLIMER 
He passes right through a wall and disappears. 
LOUIS 
He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry. 
LOUIS (screaming) Help!  There's a thing!

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER) 
Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog along the track that circles the reservoir.  One of the runners looks behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams. 
GHOSTLY JOGGER 
A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.  Other runners stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.  Seemingly oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse. 
EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME) 
Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup. 
STANTZ 
He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging track. 
GHOST JOGGER 
He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting.  As the ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit concealed control buttons.  A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride. Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger. 
VENKMAN (checking his watch) You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes? 
STANTZ If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.

EXT.  JEWELRY STORE - DAY 
The Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap dime-store Santa Claus hats. 
STANTZ (to the client) Merry Christmas!

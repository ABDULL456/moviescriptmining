VOICE (O.S.) The hurricane seemed like a disaster at the time, but now I think it was a blessing, nature's way of freeing those animals from their human confines.  Of giving them another chance to survive, but this time as they were meant to, without man's interference. 
The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled up to the end of the table. 
And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING around him. 
HAMMOND (cont'd) There are some corporate issues that are not about the bottom line.  We have so much still to learn about those creatures.  A whole world of intricate, interlocking behaviors, vanished everywhere -- except for Site B. Please.  Let's not do what is good for more men at the expense at what is best for all mankind. 
The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television. 
CHAIRMAN Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow? 
He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk. Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white eight by tens, and tosses them on the table. 
LUDLOW (an accent similar to Hammond's) These pictures were taken in a hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight hours ago, after an American family on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site B.  The little girl will be fine, but her parents are wealthy, angry, and very fond of lawsuits.  But that's hardly new to us, is it? (takes a paper from the file) Wrongful death settlements, partial list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5 million dollars; family of Robert Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or destroyed equipment, 17.3 million. Demolition, de-construction, and disposal of Isla Nublar facilities, organic and inorganic, one hundred and twenty-six million dollars.  The list goes on, gentlemen -- research funding, media payoffs.  Silence is expensive. 
He's warming up.  Not a bad performer. 
LUDLOW (cont'd) This corporation has been bleeding from the throat for four years.  You, our board of directors, have set patiently and listened to ecology lectures while Mr. Hammond signed your checks and spent your money. You have watched your stock drop from seventy-eight and a quarter to nineteen flat with no good and in sight.  And all along, we have held a significant product asset that we could have safely harvested and displayed for profit.  Enormous profit. 
He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove, sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops and Tourists look on in wonder. 
LUDLOW (cont'd) Enough money to wipe out four years of lawsuits and damage control and unpleasant infighting, enough to not only send our stock back to where it was but to double it.  And the one thing, the only thing standing between us and this asset is a born-again naturalist who happens to be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work for Mother Nature.  I work for you. 
Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack. Ludlow takes one and reads from it. 
LUDLOW (cont'd) "Whereas the Chief Executive Officer has engaged in wasteful and negligent business practices to further his own personal environmental beliefs -- Whereas these practices have affected the financial performance of the company by incurring significant losses -- Whereas the shareholders have been materially harmed by these losses -- Thereby, be it resolved that John Parker Hammond should be resolved from the office of Chief Executive Officer, affective immediately."  Mr. Chairman, I move the resolution be put to an immediate vote.  Do I have a second? 
BOARD MEMBER I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman, Please poll the members by a show of hands. 
The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor. 
CHAIRMAN All those in favor of InGen Corporate Resolution 213C, please signify your approval by raising your right hand. 
It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at the TV screen.  It goes blank. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT 
Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere. Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS. 
The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette dangling from his lips. 
DIETER Yeah. 
He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke. 
CUT TO: INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT 
Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some COMMUTERS and suck up a few more. 
A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just before they meet -- 
-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe. There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he doesn't care. 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 
MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down. He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and approaches. 
MALCOLM (under his breath) Shit. 
The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning. 
MAN You're him, aren't you? 
MALCOLM Excuse me? 
MAN The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you on TV. (conspiratorially) I believed you. 
No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer. 
MAN (cont'd) Roooooarr. 
MALCOLM (a withering look) I was misquoted.  I was merely speculating on the evolutionary scenario of a Lost World.  I never said I was in any such place. 
He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS across from him are staring at him. 
He looks at them.  They looks away. 
He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere to hide. 
INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question: 
BUTLER Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is calling? 
MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park Avenue apartment. 
MALCOLM Ian Malcolm 
A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back. It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It lunges --

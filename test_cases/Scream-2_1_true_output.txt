CICI I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride. 
MAN'S VOICE That's too bad. 
CICI "Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for? 
MAN'S VOICE What if I said you? 
CICI What if I said goodbye? 
MAN'S VOICE Why would you wanna do that? 
CICI Why do you always answer a question with a question? 
MAN'S VOICE I'm inquisitive. 
CICI I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone? 
Silence. No response. 
CICI (CONT'D) Hello? Hello? Where'd you go? 
Silence again. And then... 
MAN'S VOICE Do you wanna die tonight, Cici ? 
Almost a whisper. Simple. Direct. His voice pierces Cici. Her eyes widen. BEEP! Call waiting CLICKS through. 
CICI Just a second. (clicks over) Yes? 
Cici gets up and moves to... 
INT. FOYER - SAME 
Cici checks the front door, making sure it's locked. 
GIRL ON PHONE Was it Teddy? 
CICI No, some creep asshole trying to scare me. 
GIRL ON PHONE It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing. 
BUMP! A noise from upstairs. Cici spins around to the staircase. 
CICI Shit. 
GIRL ON PHONE What is it? 
CICI I heard a noise. 
GIRL ON PHONE Where? 
CICi Upstairs. 
BUMP! Something moves upstairs. It sounds almost like footsteps. 
CICI Shit. Cici moves to the staircase. She peers up it. 
CICI (CONT'D) (calling out) Hello? Hello? 
GIRL ON PHONE (Â… la Friday the 13th) Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah... 
CICI Stop it... 
GIRL ON PHONE I can't believe you're alone in that house. 
Cici looks up the staircase again. 
CICI (soft whisper) I don't think I'm alone. 
Floorboards CREAK above her. Cici freaks. 
CICI I'm outta here. 
She flies to the door, unlocking it, throwing it open. She moves out onto the... 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - SAME 
A wooden porch with a bulb glowing overhead. She stands on the porch steps, looking back, through the open door, into the house. The phone starts to CRACKLE. 
GIRL ON PHONE You're breaking up. Where are you? 
CICI Outside.

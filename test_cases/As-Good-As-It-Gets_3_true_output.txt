Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity. 
CAROL You're going to get the results today?! 
MOVING SHOT 
As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from each other at a small table... soft voices...  relaxation. Bettes is examining medicine bottles. 
DR. BETTES How long has he been having problems? 
CAROL Since forever. 
DR. BETTES Have they done blood tests on him? 
CAROL Yes. 
DR. BETTES Only in the emergency room or when he was well. 
CAROL Emergency room only. 
DR. BETTES Have they done skin testing for allergies? 
CAROL No. 
DR. BETTES They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin? 
CAROL No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway. 
DR. BETTES It's amazing these things weren't done. 
CAROL Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me. 
DR. BETTES No. Actually, I think that's their technical name. 
CAROL Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results? 
DR. BETTES Me. My home number is on this card. 
CAROL His home number. 
Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly has a hard time stopping. 
CAROL (to doctor) Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves? 
DR. BETTES Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room? 
CAROL No. 
She starts towards Spencer's room. 
DR. BETTES You don't have to do it this second...  it's not dangerous or anything. It's just something that's advisable. Look, there's a lot to be checked but...  Hey, your son is going to feel a good deal better at the very least... 
She pats his head...  Then embraces him with fierce intimacy. 
CAROL Doc!!! (then) So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll... 
DR. BETTES They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed. 
She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin. 
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained Nora hugs him good-bye. 
NORA You poor, poor man. 
SIMON Let's use just one poor, okay? Anyway, dear, thanks for everything. Forgive my recent crankiness and as soon as things are on track again I'll call. 
She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.

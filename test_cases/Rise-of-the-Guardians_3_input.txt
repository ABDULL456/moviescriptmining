As Jamie gets up off the ground, he sees that the Easter egg was in fact a dirty old tennis ball. Jamie stands up, bewildered, and dusts himself off as his friends LAUGH. A few have empty EASTER BASKETS. 
JAMIE Let's check the park again. 
CALEB Really? 
CLAUDE (ANNOYED) For what, the Easter Bunny? 
JAMIE Guys, I told you - I saw him! He's way bigger than I thought, and he's got these cool boomerang-things- 
CALEB Grow up, Jamie. 
CLAUDE (SIGHS) Ah man, seriously. 
JAMIE What's happened to you guys? 
CALEB It was a dream. You should be happy you still get dreams like that and not... 
They begin to turn away from him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 96. 
CUPCAKE (HAUNTED) Nightmares. 
Pippa's the lone straggler. She looks tired, depressed, and hands Jamie her basket as she leaves. 
PIPPA Forget it, Jamie. There's just no Easter this year. 
CALEB (O.S.) I can't believe this. 
JAMIE He really is real! 
Pippa walks away, trailing the others. Jamie doesn't know what to believe. He hangs his head and looks into the Easter basket, it's empty. 
JAMIE (CONT'D) I know he is. 
INT. NORTH POLE - GLOBE ROOM - DAY 
Yetis stare at the globe of belief, in shock as more and more lights begin to fad away. We push in toward Antarctica as we- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
SEQ. 2304 - JACK IN ANTARCTICA 
EXT. ICEBERG - ANTARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY 
Jack runs to the edge of a floating iceberg, ready to throw his tooth box into the ocean. He resists, looking down at the box as he clutches it in his hand. He's never been more alone in his life. 
PITCH (O.S.) I thought this might happen. 
Pitch is revealed, standing not far behind Jack. 
PITCH (CONT'D) They never really believed in you. I was just trying to show you that. But I understand. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 97. 
Jack whips around and shoots a burst of frost at Pitch, but it's quickly deflected by the Nightmare sand. 
JACK You don't understand anything! 
Jack continues to attack, lashing out with his staff. Pitch blocks the attacks of ice and frost -- his control over the Nightmare sand has gained considerable strength. 
PITCH (SHOUTING) No? I don't know what it's like to be cast out? 
Pitch strikes back, putting Jack on the defense. Jack jumps in the air. Their show of force escalates until they're shrouded in a blanket of snow, ice, and wind. As the wind and snow settle, Jack looks around stern and alert. 
PITCH (O.S.)(CONT'D) To not be believed in. To long for a family. 
Jack turns around to find Pitch. There's a look of compassion on Jack's face as he listens. 
PITCH (CONT'D) All those years in the shadows I thought, no one else knows what this feels like. But now I see I was wrong. 
They lock eyes. A moment of true connection between them. 
PITCH (CONT'D) We don't have to be alone, Jack. 
This isn't a trick Pitch is making a real offer here. 
PITCH (CONT'D) I believe in you. And I know children will too. 
JACK In me? 
PITCH Yes! Look at what we can do! 
Pitch gestures to a fantastical ice and nightmare "sculpture" that was created (off-screen) when Jack attacked him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 98. 
PITCH (CONT'D) What goes together better than cold and dark? 
Jack looks at the fractured reflections of themselves cast in the icy sculpture. 
PITCH (CONT'D) We can make them believe. We'll give them a world where everything, everything is... 
Jack turns to face Pitch. 
JACK (DEADPANS) Pitch black... 
Pitch, realizing how this looks, clarifies... 
PITCH And Jack Frost too. They'll believe in both of us. 
Jack stares at him, considering the offer. Then finally... 
JACK No, they'll fear both of us. And that's not what I want.

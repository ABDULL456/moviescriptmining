INT. COURTROOM 
CASINO GUARD Our job is to keep order. But there was no chance of that. Me and my men we were just tryin to control him. He was highly trained, violent, very dangerous person. 
PROSECUTOR So dangerous, so violent, so highly trained that he despatched six of the casino staff single handedly. His weapon of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which in his hand became a devastating force with one aim, to hurt people, destroy property. 
WORKER He went directly for everything. He just came in and took over the place. 
PROSECUTOR You said he broke your arm. 
WORKER Yea that's correct, my right forearm. Both bones with a single shot. It was crazy. 
CASINO GUARD 2 You know, toss out a coupla drunks now and then. Guys try to grope the girls, but ah nothing with this sort of violence. 
PROSECUTOR Did he give you any kind of advanced warning? A chance to defend yourself. 
CASINO GUARD 2 We tussled, but he's a big guy. He was on a mission. Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see. 
PROSECUTOR So from what you saw, it seemed like he had some kinda purpose?

{"test1_input": "CONTINUED: \nRONNIE So as you can see, the law is just one little call away. But I'm gonna choose not to use that tactic today. I'm gonna do something that I like to do from time to time, and that's called handle shit myself. \nRonnie takes his pad out of his pocket.    He begins writing. \nRONNIE While I won't have you arrested today, I am going to suspend each of you for one week. For those of you who don't know how this works, here it is. This is official documentation. If you step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing. At that point, I call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail. \nRonnie fills out the paperwork, sets the suspension notes on the table. Stevie looks down at it. He picks it up, reads it, balls it up, and throws it at Ronnie. \nThe Skaters start cracking up. \nRONNIE You accepted it originally, so it still counts. \nRonnie sits there while the Skaters laugh. \nINT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY \nRonnie sits at a table with a Cinnabon in front of him. Across the table sits NELL, a chubby but cute girl, who wears a Cinnabon uniform. The couple holds hands and they have their heads bowed. \nNELL Dear Lord, bless this food that we eat and purify it with Your salvation. Also, please keep Ronnie safe as he works in Your name to protect the customers and employees and store owners of the mall. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNELL (CONT'D) And please turn your wrath on any sinners that try to hurt him and make them pay by burning in the eternal flames of hell. In Christ's name we pray, amen. \nRONNIE Amen. \nRonnie begins devouring his Cinnabon. \nNELL So what's on the agenda for you today? \nRONNIE You know, the usual. Spot crime before it happens, perform random acts of bravery, save people from certain death, yada yada yada. \nNELL What's wrong, Ronnie? \nRONNIE Nothing, Nell. \nNELL Ronnie, I know that you really want to be a Police Officer, but you have to realize that things work out the way they're meant to. \nRONNIE I know. I'm okay, Nell. Thanks, but really, I mean, I'm on the front lines right now. I'm livin' it. \nNELL Your job is definitely more exciting than mine. \nRONNIE Of course it is, but at least you don't have to wrestle with the demons at night. I better get going. \nNELL I'll see you after work, sweetie. \nNell leans in to kiss Ronnie, but he pulls away. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Not at work, Nell. We have to keep up appearances, we talked about this. And don't call me sweetie. \nNELL I'm sorry. I'll see you after work, Officer Barnhardt. \nRONNIE 'Bye, Nell. \nRonnie stands up and walks off. \nINT. MALL - DAY \nRonnie stands in the middle of the mall and supervises the early morning MALL WALKERS as they stride around the outer marked lane. It's all senior citizens. \nRONNIE Slow it down. Watch your speed there. This ain't a race. Hey, second time, slow it down. \nMark, the Mall Manager, walks up to Ronnie. \nMARK I've been looking all over for you. \nRONNIE I haven't been hiding, but some things that I have to do are better to keep hidden from you and 'official' eyes. Trust me, it's best all around if there are no bodies to clean up. \nMARK So you may or may not have heard, but this morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy Pervert. \nRONNIE For the love of God. \nMARK I know, it's horrible. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE You want me to phone this one in to the police? \nMARK Not just yet. See if we call the police, they'll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall. What I need you to do is watch out for this Pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle this discreetly. \nRONNIE Hold on, Mark. Let me make sure I understand you. You're telling me to deny my primary objective of Observing and Reporting crime and at the same time, you're giving me authorization to handle this case on my own. \n", "test1_true": "RONNIE So basically, I'm in charge of this whole investigation. \nMARK There's no investigation. \nRONNIE Not yet. Okay, Mark, I'll do it, but I'm gonna need a few things first. \nMARK You can't carry a gun. \nRONNIE Well, I'm gonna need a new title. Something to instill fear in the criminal mind. How about Director of Mall Intelligence? \nMARK Head of Mall Security. \nRONNIE That's perfect. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARK And it doesn't come with a raise. \nRONNIE Got it. \nMARK And the new title stays between us. \nRONNIE Understood.

CAROLINA MALL - DAY \nRonnie stands in front of a Cadillac with a boot on one of his tires. \nA local news camera crew comes up to Ronnie and the FEMALE REPORTER starts asking questions. \nFEMALE REPORTER Excuse me, sir, but we would like to ask you a few questions. \nRONNIE I'm sorry, but I can't answer anything. \nFEMALE REPORTER We heard a report that an unidentified man was spotted earlier today exposing himself to several women. Do you care to comment? \nRONNIE I'm not allowed to comment on that situation. \nFEMALE REPORTER So you admit there is a situation. \nRONNIE I'm trained to resist torture for up to 72 hours, you really expect me to break now? Get real, lady. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFEMALE REPORTER (to her camera crew) We're wasting our time here. Let's go find some police to interview. \nRONNIE Good luck. \nFEMALE REPORTER What's that supposed to mean? \nRONNIE It just means you won't find any police. \nFEMALE REPORTER Are you telling me the police haven't even been called! \nRONNIE (SARCASTIC) Ewww, alert the media. \nFEMALE REPORTER Jesus, well who'd they leave in charge, you? \nRonnie smiles like he knows a secret. \nFEMALE REPORTER Yeah, right. Why would they leave you in charge? \nRONNIE First of all, if there was a situation to be handled, I don't see why you find it so goddamn ridiculous that I would be in charge. \nThe Reporter waves for her crew to start filming. \nFEMALE REPORTER (setting a trap) Look, there is no way you're in charge of this investigation. \nRONNIE Well for your information, I'm in charge of this whole fucking operation. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE (CONT'D) I don't give a goddamn if you believe me or not, Ms. Hot Fuckin' SHIT news lady. I'm the first line of defense against this pervert. As the law's right hand, I'm here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun. I'm the defender of this war zone. Just me and my goddamn flashlight. \nJust then, SADDAMN, an angry Middle Easterner with shitloads of cell phones and beepers strapped to him, comes running up to Ronnie. \nSADDAMN You motherfucker, you put a boot on my car! \nRONNIE (cop voice) I warned you about parking in the fire lane, Saddamn! \nSADDAMN Fuck you, Ronnie!

The sound is OFF. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe living room is dark. Ronnie and Nell are on the couch making out. Ronnie is starting to get frisky. His hands go to Nell's boobs, but only outside of the shirt. She allows it. \nRonnie decides to push it. He takes his hand and tries to go up her shirt. Nell immediately stops kissing and pushes Ronnie away. \nNELL What are you doing, Ronnie? \nRONNIE Come on, let me get some of those big bazoombas. \nRonnie goes in hard for the tits, but Nell pushes him away. \nNELL Ronnie, no. \nRONNIE Goddamn it, are we ever gonna do it? \nNELL You know we talked about this. \nRONNIE We did, it's just, well, I'm tired of just doing what we do. I'm ready for something bigger. Like sex or just maybe using a finger on you -- \nNELL Ronnie, you know I'm saving myself for marriage. I thought you were okay with that. \nRONNIE Well, I used to be, it's just. I don't know. What's so great about being a 27-year-old virgin? \nNell stands up and starts to put on her coat.       Ronnie stands up and tries to comfort her. \nRONNIE Nell, I'm sorry. Don't go away like this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNELL I thought you loved my purity. \nRONNIE I do.   I really do. I'm sorry, Nell. \nNELL It's okay.   I should leave anyway, it's late. \nRONNIE I'll stop by for breakfast tomorrow. \nNELL See ya tomorrow. \nNell leaves and Ronnie closes the door behind her. \nRONNIE Mom, wake up.    Let's go to bed. \nRonnie's mom groans. She has been passed out on the floor with an empty bottle of Jack D beside her the whole time. \nINT. MALL - NIGHT \nThe lights are off and a gloved hand breaks into a case in the jewelry store. All of the diamonds and gold are picked up and pocketed. Someone is robbing this bitch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - THE NEXT MORNING \nRonnie strolls through the mall sipping on his morning coffee. He stops when he sees that the jewelry store has been broken into and robbed. \nRONNIE Oh shit. \nRonnie goes running down through the mall. \nINT. MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING \nDennis and Ronnie are sitting and Mark stands over them. They're looking at the security tapes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDetective Harrison knocks on the door and walks in. Ronnie stands up to greet him. \nRONNIE Good to see you, brother. Looks like the old team is getting together to crack one more case. \nRonnie gives Detective Harrison a hug. \nRONNIE I'm ready to go to war with you. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Thanks for waking me up this morning, Ronnie. \nRONNIE I've already checked the Security tapes. They didn't catch a thing. Someone must have broken in here and turned them off. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON My team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry. I've also checked out the crime scene, but we didn't see any fingerprints on the glass. The suspect was probably wearing gloves. \nMARK That doesn't sound good.   How did they do it? \nRONNIE Laser technology. \n", "test2_true": "RONNIE Detective Harrison, can I ask you how long you've been a detective for? \nDETECTIVE HARRISON I'm almost at the end of my first year. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Just as I thought, a rookie. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON I've been a police officer for several years. \nRONNIE Yeah, you're a rookie, okay. It's fine, you'll learn with experience. And when you do, you'll discover that rule #1 of law enforcement is that you don't ever turn on a fellow officer. Now, I know you would never actually accuse somebody on my Security Force of committing this act of lawlessness. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Whoever did this would have to had keys to the Security Room so they could shut off the camera. \nRONNIE Look, my record speaks for itself and as for Dennis, well I can certainly vouch for him. Dennis is one of the finest men I know, so just take my word, you're barking up the wrong tree. Now, let's put this little squabble behind us and get back to busting the guys that robbed this mall. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, nobody is accusing anybody, but I would like to stick around for a while and interview some of the employees. \nMARK Okay, but all I ask is that you do it quietly, so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON I understand. \nRONNIE I understand too, sir. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARK Ronnie, you are to leave Detective Harrison alone and let him handle the investigation. \nRONNIE No can do, Mark. When you appointed me Head of Mall Security, I swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in bringing crime to its knees. \nMARK You didn't swear an oath. \nRONNIE To myself I did. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, on these types of investigations, it's usually not a good idea to have too many cooks in the kitchen. \nRONNIE There's only one cook. I'm a chef. A cook and chef, together, serving up justice. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON I'm gonna do this alone. \nRONNIE Hot plates of justice. \nRonnie stands up. \nRONNIE Come on, rookie. Let me show you the lay of the land. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - DAY \nRonnie talks to Dennis in the middle of the mall. \nRONNIE Okay, Dennis. I've gotta hang with Detective Harrison. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE (CONT'D) What I need for you to understand is that just because Detective Harrison is here, doesn't mean that you and me are no longer best friends. Sure, Harrison would be cool to hang out with. He carries a badge and a gun. He probably owns a boat. Over time, we'll probably become really close like brothers, but for right now, you're still number one. Now, I must leave you behind because duty calls, so... chin up. Radio if you need anything. \nRonnie takes off, but we STAY WITH Dennis. He walks directly to the ARCADE. Dennis puts a quarter in the machine and plays pinball. \nINT. MALL - KIOSK - DAY \nRonnie watches from afar as Detective Harrison interviews SADDAMN, who stands in front of his cell phone kiosk. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON So, have you seen any suspicious people hanging around the mall? Anybody who might have been casing the stores? \nSADDAMN Nah, man.   I ain't seen nothing. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Okay, well if you can think of anything, here's my card. \nDetective Harrison hands Saddamn his card and begins to leave. Disgusted, Ronnie comes walking up. \nRONNIE (to Harrison) My turn, Rookie. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON What are you doing, Ronnie? \nRONNIE Solving the whole case right before your eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, this is official police business. \n", "test2_id": 1060, "test3_input": "INT. MALL - SEARS - DAY \nRonnie and Detective Harrison are in the hardware department talking to the SEARS MANAGER. Detective Harrison sits on the ground. He has completely given up on the investigation at this point, as Ronnie controls it all. \nRonnie picks up a hammer. \nRONNIE Now, maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm the smartest man alive, but it seems kind of convenient to me that you sell hammers like this one that could easily be used to smash a glass case in, oh say, a jewelry store. \nSEARS MANAGER Couldn't you smash the glass with anything? \nRONNIE You really think you're gonna talk your way out of this one? \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY \nRonnie is hanging out with Dennis and the Bouncer from O'Charley's. Behind him, Nell works the counter at Cinnabon. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE You guys should have been there today. We were just solving shit left and right. I mean, that's what this job is supposed to be like. Busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from the fountain has its rewards, but really getting in there and closing cases is where it's at. It's rewarding too because at the end of the day, you know you've done something good for the world. \nBOUNCER What are we doing here, Ronnie? I thought you said they were giving away free Chick-fil-A sandwiches. \nRONNIE Well -- What is your name anyway? \nBOUNCER Charles. \nRONNIE Well, my young apprentice. I called you here today because as Head of Mall Security, I have decided that it's time to take protection to the next level. In other words, I alone cannot combat this recent crime wave. In order to help me in my personal journey, I have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers. So, for now on, Dennis, my right-hand man, you will be in charge of solving the case of who is robbing the mall. Little Chucky, you will be on the case of the Pervert. You are both to collect data and provide it to me. I will analyze the data, draw conclusions, and solve these crimes as well as coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies. \nBOUNCER Since we're going to be doing a lot of the work and you're going to be solving the crimes, do we at least get paid? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE You can't measure honor in dollars and cents. \nRonnie looks over at the Cinnabon and Nell waves to him. Ronnie smiles back and waves at Nell. \nBOUNCER Is that your girlfriend or something, Ronnie? \nRONNIE Who me? Nah, man. Why?     What do you think of her? \nBOUNCER She's not my type, but that's just me. \nRONNIE Yeah, but, you don't think she's kind of hot? \nBOUNCER Are you blind? Give me a break. Wait, are you sure she's not your girlfriend? \nRONNIE Fuck no. There's no way I'd date that... person who's obviously not hot. \nNell waves again, but Ronnie just kind of turns away, ignoring her. \nRONNIE Anyway, our new unit will operate under the name, 'Special Elite Task Force.' You will answer directly to me and no one else. Now, let's all put our hands in the middle and do a unifying cheer. \nRonnie puts his hand out.     Dennis puts his in as well. Charles isn't sure. \nBOUNCER You're gonna hook me up with a job, right? \nRONNIE Seven even.   I promise. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCharles puts his hand in as well. \nRONNIE One, two, three, TASK FORCE! \nRonnie is the only one who gets into it.      It's a weak-ass cheer. \nRONNIE Okay, so now I say we all take a celebratory trip to Sears because, as we all know, today is half- price day on all automotive parts for mall employees. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

They walk united and unopposed. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT \nRonnie tacks up pictures of all of the      robbery \"suspects\" on a bulletin board. It's pictures of       Saddamn and the Devil Worshipper guy. Beside him is a       sketch of the Pervert.

What are you still doing here? \nBRANDI I had to do inventory tonight. Bruce took off early so I'm the last one. Hey, I was wondering if you would mind walking me to my car.

I was just thinking, would you like to go to dinner this weekend? \nBRANDI How come every time somebody does something nice for me, they act like I owe them a blow job? \nRONNIE Look, it's not like that.

We're going to dinner, but we are not going on a date. \nRONNIE Done. \nBRANDI And you can never tell anybody we went out. \nRONNIE My lips are sealed. \nBRANDI You pay for dinner, right?   And as many drinks as I want. \nRONNIE You may drink your fill. \nBRANDI And you have to drive me to my car every night after work for the next six months. \nRONNIE You got it. \nBRANDI And my car is low on gas, so I need some money to fill it up. \nRonnie takes out his wallet. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Is $20 enough? \nBRANDI Nah, fifty. \nRonnie takes out more money and hands it to Brandi.         She takes it, counts it, and puts it into her bra. \nBRANDI Okay, you can pick me up after work on Saturday. Dinner and that's it. Don't try to kiss me because I'll smack the shit out of you. It's not a date. \nRONNIE Got it.   Not a date. \nBRANDI Thanks for the ride. \nBrandi climbs out of the golf cart and walks to her car.

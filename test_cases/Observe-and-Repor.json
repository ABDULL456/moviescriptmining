{"train": "OBSERVE AND REPORT \nWritten by \nJody Hill \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING \nONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK. \nA PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes the old women. They SCREAM! \nThe Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes them. \nThe Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR. \nThe Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY, flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and flashes ANOTHER GIRL. \nIt's an all-out Pervert assault! \nThe Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an assassination. \nINT. MALL - BUSINESS OFFICES - DAY \nMARK, the Mall Manager, walks by a group of women, who were exposed to the Pervert. They crowd around and complain loudly. \nMARK Ladies, please, we're doing everything we can to handle the situation. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our shoppers. Now in the meantime, feel free to check out some of our wonderful back-to- school sales. Excuse me for a minute. \nMark walks down the hallway that houses all of the business affair offices. He stops at the RECEPTIONIST'S desk. \nMARK Have you seen Ronnie? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRECEPTIONIST I haven't seen him all morning. \nThe Mall Manager quickly walks off.    On the way, he passes a JANITOR. \nMARK Ramon, have you seen Ronnie? \nJANITOR No, senor. \nThe Mall Manager keeps walking. \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nThe Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room. It's a small office with monitors that show the different security cameras around the mall. DENNIS, a Mall Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word ever, turns around in the chair. \nMARK Where is Ronnie? \nDennis shrugs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GARAGE - DAY \nBlackness. White shafts of light sporadically shoot through the dark and we see IMAGES. A GIANT FLASHLIGHT is inserted into a UTILITY BELT. MACE is inserted in the other side. A WALKIE-TALKIE is turned on. A TASER is sparked. MIRRORED SUNGLASSES are pushed over the nose. \nA garage door raises and bright light spills in... \nEXT. GARAGE - DAY \nA garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around. The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall security guard whose expression reads all business. Ronnie pulls out of the garage... \nSUPERIMPOSE:    OBSERVE AND REPORT \nEXT. MALL - DAY \nHEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over. \nMeanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max. \nThe skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking lot. \nThe skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent orange siren and gives chase. \nAs the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls up and drives alongside of them. \nRONNIE (cop authority voice) Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW! \nSTEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back. \nSTEVIE Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a parking lot. \nRONNIE Sir, pull over to the sidewalk, NOW! \nHECTOR, another skater, joins in. \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE So as you can see, the law is just one little call away. But I'm gonna choose not to use that tactic today. I'm gonna do something that I like to do from time to time, and that's called handle shit myself. \nRonnie takes his pad out of his pocket.    He begins writing. \nRONNIE While I won't have you arrested today, I am going to suspend each of you for one week. For those of you who don't know how this works, here it is. This is official documentation. If you step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing. At that point, I call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail. \nRonnie fills out the paperwork, sets the suspension notes on the table. Stevie looks down at it. He picks it up, reads it, balls it up, and throws it at Ronnie. \nThe Skaters start cracking up. \nRONNIE You accepted it originally, so it still counts. \nRonnie sits there while the Skaters laugh. \nINT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY \nRonnie sits at a table with a Cinnabon in front of him. Across the table sits NELL, a chubby but cute girl, who wears a Cinnabon uniform. The couple holds hands and they have their heads bowed. \nNELL Dear Lord, bless this food that we eat and purify it with Your salvation. Also, please keep Ronnie safe as he works in Your name to protect the customers and employees and store owners of the mall. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNELL (CONT'D) And please turn your wrath on any sinners that try to hurt him and make them pay by burning in the eternal flames of hell. In Christ's name we pray, amen. \nRONNIE Amen. \nRonnie begins devouring his Cinnabon. \nNELL So what's on the agenda for you today? \nRONNIE You know, the usual. Spot crime before it happens, perform random acts of bravery, save people from certain death, yada yada yada. \nNELL What's wrong, Ronnie? \nRONNIE Nothing, Nell. \nNELL Ronnie, I know that you really want to be a Police Officer, but you have to realize that things work out the way they're meant to. \nRONNIE I know. I'm okay, Nell. Thanks, but really, I mean, I'm on the front lines right now. I'm livin' it. \nNELL Your job is definitely more exciting than mine. \nRONNIE Of course it is, but at least you don't have to wrestle with the demons at night. I better get going. \nNELL I'll see you after work, sweetie. \nNell leans in to kiss Ronnie, but he pulls away. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Not at work, Nell. We have to keep up appearances, we talked about this. And don't call me sweetie. \nNELL I'm sorry. I'll see you after work, Officer Barnhardt. \nRONNIE 'Bye, Nell. \nRonnie stands up and walks off. \nINT. MALL - DAY \nRonnie stands in the middle of the mall and supervises the early morning MALL WALKERS as they stride around the outer marked lane. It's all senior citizens. \nRONNIE Slow it down. Watch your speed there. This ain't a race. Hey, second time, slow it down. \nMark, the Mall Manager, walks up to Ronnie. \nMARK I've been looking all over for you. \nRONNIE I haven't been hiding, but some things that I have to do are better to keep hidden from you and 'official' eyes. Trust me, it's best all around if there are no bodies to clean up. \nMARK So you may or may not have heard, but this morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy Pervert. \nRONNIE For the love of God. \nMARK I know, it's horrible. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE You want me to phone this one in to the police? \nMARK Not just yet. See if we call the police, they'll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall. What I need you to do is watch out for this Pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle this discreetly. \nRONNIE Hold on, Mark. Let me make sure I understand you. You're telling me to deny my primary objective of Observing and Reporting crime and at the same time, you're giving me authorization to handle this case on my own. \nRONNIE (going into cop VOICE) Step away now! \nSADDAMN I pay good money to this mall. Don't tell me where to park! \nRONNIE Sir, I will be forced to take action if you do not step back! \nSADDAMN I'm gonna kill you! \nRonnie pulls out his taser and shoots Saddamn. Saddamn goes down hard and begins twitching. He is fucking out of it! \nRonnie goes back to giving the interview as if nothing happened. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE As I was saying, the pervert situation here is real bleak. For all you people out there thinking of coming to the mall, please for your own safety, stay away. \nSADDAMN (still fucked up) I can't believe you tased me. \nRONNIE (to the man) That's right and I've got another one waiting right here for you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nBRANDI, the make-up counter girl, globs on tons of make- up. She's a hot girl who looks like she's spent a few sticky nights in the bed of a truck. \nRonnie stands back and watches Brandi.       Finally, he walks up to her. \nRONNIE Hey, Brandi. \nBrandi looks up from her mirror and then goes back to applying make-up. \nRONNIE That color looks great on your skin. Not just that color, but I've noticed that all make-up looks really good on you. Especially the blue around your eyes. I bet it drives the men crazy. \nBrandi glares at Ronnie. \nRONNIE It's okay.   I can say that because I'm taken. \nBRANDI What do you want, Ronnie? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE I'm here on official business. See, I don't know if you know this, but I have recently been made Head of Mall Security. Did you hear about that? \nBRANDI No. \nRONNIE Well, I'm sure you will. It's actually pretty huge news. But the reason I stopped by is to tell you that it looks like we've got a pervert on the loose. A real live psychopath who gains sexual gratification by exposing himself to ladies such as yourself. I just want to warn you to be careful when coming and going to work. \nBRANDI Okay, got it. \nRONNIE And you may not want to wear any of those skirts that you like to wear. \nBRANDI What skirts? \nRONNIE You know what skirts. Something like that could set him off. And for that matter, you better not wear any of those little low-cut top things either, okay? Especially with those black bras because, you can really see them in the light. Perverts really tend to notice stuff like that. Okay, see you later. \nRonnie takes off and leaves Brandi still applying make- up. \nINT. MALL - NIGHT \nThe lights are turned off and the mall is empty.      Ronnie walks out with Dennis. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Dennis, man, I'm glad we've got a minute to talk. There's no easy way to say this so I'm just going to come right out with it. Mark offered me the position of Head of Mall Security. I know this isn't easy for you to hear seeing as you've been here longer than me. But I want you to know that you're my best friend and I'm only going to accept the job if you're okay with that. \nDennis shrugs. \nRONNIE Well, you should know I've already accepted and it's too late to turn it down now. Every ship needs a captain. So you were passed over. Who gives a shit? Dennis, in time, you'll come to accept answering to me. Remember, there aren't any leaders in friendship. We cool? \nDennis and Ronnie shake hands.    They walk out and lock the doors behind them. \nRONNIE Hey, you want to go and grab a beer or something? \nDennis doesn't say anything and just walks to his car. Ronnie follows. \nRONNIE Yeah, you're right. You're probably in no mood to party after that news. Well, try not to take it too hard. See you later, buddy. \nRonnie leaves Dennis and walks to his car. \nEXT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nRonnie's home is a shitty double-wide at the very end of the shittiest trailer park in town. \nINT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE (CONT'D) My official orders are Observe and Report, but when Mark put me in charge of mall security, something inside of me changed. It's what I've always wanted. Things haven't always worked out, with the whole... well, you know. But this gives me faith that I can do something great. This is my call to duty and I'm going to answer. I'm going to bust this fucking pervert. I swear it on everything I am. Anyway, I better get to sleep. I got a big day tomorrow. Good night, Mom. (off no answer) Mom? \nOn cue, Ronnie's Mom falls over in a drunken sleep. She starts SNORING loud as hell. Ronnie gets out of the covers and helps his Mom onto the bed. Ronnie tucks her in like a loving son. He pries the bottle from her fingers. Then, he grabs a pillow and goes to sleep on the floor. \nINT. MALL - O'CHARLEY'S - DAY \nRonnie walks up to O'Charley's. It's the one-step-up restaurant that's in the mall. There's a BOUNCER out front who watches over the store. \nRONNIE You working the door here? \nBOUNCER That's what they tell me. They needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever. \nRONNIE Kind of funny they thought they needed more security here. Ha. You do realize that if anyone gets out of hand, you need to call me to handle the situation. \nBOUNCER I work for O'Charley's, not for the mall. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Granted, but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of Carolina Mall? \nBOUNCER You know, I thought about getting a job as a Mall Security. \nRONNIE You did? \nBOUNCER Yeah, man. I mean, I'm kind of on extended vacation from college and it's just like, I don't want to do shit, you know what I mean? My parents said I have to work if I want to live at home, but I just don't feel like doing anything. This was the easiest job I could find, I mean, what the hell could be hard about being a bouncer in a mall restaurant? But now that I think about it, Mall Security could be easier than this. \nRONNIE My young friend, you are sorely mistaken. Do you know how much stuff I'm in charge of? \nBOUNCER No. \nRONNIE A shitload. That's not even counting the parking lot. \nBOUNCER Really? I thought you just kind of chilled out and called stuff into the police. \nRONNIE No way, that's about like 75, maybe 82 percent of it. There's so much other stuff. \nBOUNCER Like what? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Two words, Friday Night. \nBOUNCER What about it? \nRONNIE It's crazy, let's just leave it at that. \nBOUNCER Okay. \nRONNIE Listen. I like you, but I don't like the fact that you're masquerading as an official in the security world. If you're serious about a career in the security world, then perhaps I could look into getting you a job on my staff? \nBOUNCER Oh yeah? \nRONNIE Part of my job is reaching out to troubled youths such as yourself. It's who I am. \nBOUNCER Does it pay more than $6.50 an hour? \nRonnie laughs.       He leans over to the Bouncer and whispers in his ear. \nBOUNCER (WHISPERING) Seven even. \nRonnie stands back and winks at the Bouncer. \nBOUNCER I'd say that's more than I'm making now. \nRONNIE Hold on, this job involves a probationary period. You have to prove yourself worthy. We can't just hire any old Tom, Dick, or Harry just because they want to carry a flashlight. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOUNCER What do I have to do? \nRONNIE You have to complete a term as deputy. You will answer directly to me. Your job will be to come and find me if you see any trouble. If this works out, then I will phone the crime into the police. Now, this will train your eyes to spot various criminal activity. Once you have completed your training, you will be awarded an official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of actually phoning in crimes to the police yourself. \nBOUNCER So basically, I just do what I'm doing now and then you'll get me a job? \nRONNIE For starters. \nBOUNCER How long does this mentorship last? \nRONNIE Until Mark lets me hire another guy. \nBOUNCER Can I smoke while I work? \nRONNIE Yes, you can. \nRONNIE Rogers. \nBRANDI I can't walk right now.   I feel like I'm in shock. \nRONNIE Don't worry.   I'll carry you. \nRonnie reaches down and picks up Brandi. She totally lets him. Ronnie struggles and can't lift her. It looks dumb. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARK Oh, fucking Jesus. \nRonnie finally manages to lift Brandi. He carries her out of the Department Store and down through the middle of the mall. \nEXT. MALL - DAY \nA black UNMARKED POLICE CAR pulls up quickly and stops directly in front of the Main Entrance to the mall as if to say to the world, \"I'm a Cop and I can do this.\" \nOut steps DETECTIVE HARRISON, a young cop that has the arrogance and swagger of a man who is just beginning to feel his power. \nINT. MALL MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY \nMark sits at his desk, while Ronnie comforts a crying Brandi. Dennis stands in the corner, not saying a word. \nDetective Harrison knocks as he comes in the door. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Your secretary told me to come on in. I'm Detective Harrison, Cabarrus County Police. \nDetective Harrison shows his badge to Mark.         The two men shake. \nMARK Mark Talbert, I manage the mall. This is Brandi, she's the one who saw the deviant. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Hello, Brandi.     Are you doing okay? \nBRANDI I'm really shaken up. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Yes, ma'am, I'm sure you are after all you've been through, but I'm here to tell you that we're going to work together to make sure we catch the person who did this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief inspector on the case and head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall and this is my lieutenant, Dennis. From one law enforcement officer to another, I just want to welcome you and say that we will do whatever it takes to coordinate with your department in order to bring this assailant to justice. \nThe Detective pauses as if he's unsure what just happened. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Great. (back to Brandi) Okay, Brandi. Did you get a look at the suspect? \nBRANDI Yes, I did. \nRONNIE Did you get a blood sample? \nBRANDI No. \nRONNIE That's a shame. Would have been useful. \nMARK Go ahead, Detective. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Thank you. Brandi, can you remember anything specifically? What color was his hair? Was he tall or short? \nBRANDI He was tall and skinny and he had brown hair and it was real greasy. \nDetective Harrison begins writing in his note pad as Brandi speaks. Ronnie notices this and picks up some paper and begins to write as well. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Was his hair long or short? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRANDI It was long about to his shoulders. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Did he say anything? \nBRANDI No, he just stood there and you know, touched himself. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON What was he wearing? \nBRANDI Just a brown trench coat. \nRONNIE This is what I got so far. \nRonnie holds up his paper. Ronnie has drawn a crude sketch of the Pervert that Brandi described, but it's basically a long-haired stick figure with a penis. \nRONNIE What's yours look like? \nDETECTIVE HARRISON I just wrote a description. \nRONNIE Oh. \nThe LOCAL NEWS is on and they show an update on the MALL FLASHER STORY. The sound is OFF. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe living room is dark. Ronnie and Nell are on the couch making out. Ronnie is starting to get frisky. His hands go to Nell's boobs, but only outside of the shirt. She allows it. \nRonnie decides to push it. He takes his hand and tries to go up her shirt. Nell immediately stops kissing and pushes Ronnie away. \nNELL What are you doing, Ronnie? \nRONNIE Come on, let me get some of those big bazoombas. \nRonnie goes in hard for the tits, but Nell pushes him away. \nNELL Ronnie, no. \nRONNIE Goddamn it, are we ever gonna do it? \nNELL You know we talked about this. \nRONNIE We did, it's just, well, I'm tired of just doing what we do. I'm ready for something bigger. Like sex or just maybe using a finger on you -- \nNELL Ronnie, you know I'm saving myself for marriage. I thought you were okay with that. \nRONNIE Well, I used to be, it's just. I don't know. What's so great about being a 27-year-old virgin? \nNell stands up and starts to put on her coat.       Ronnie stands up and tries to comfort her. \nRONNIE Nell, I'm sorry. Don't go away like this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNELL I thought you loved my purity. \nRONNIE I do.   I really do. I'm sorry, Nell. \nNELL It's okay.   I should leave anyway, it's late. \nRONNIE I'll stop by for breakfast tomorrow. \nNELL See ya tomorrow. \nNell leaves and Ronnie closes the door behind her. \nRONNIE Mom, wake up.    Let's go to bed. \nRonnie's mom groans. She has been passed out on the floor with an empty bottle of Jack D beside her the whole time. \nINT. MALL - NIGHT \nThe lights are off and a gloved hand breaks into a case in the jewelry store. All of the diamonds and gold are picked up and pocketed. Someone is robbing this bitch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - THE NEXT MORNING \nRonnie strolls through the mall sipping on his morning coffee. He stops when he sees that the jewelry store has been broken into and robbed. \nRONNIE Oh shit. \nRonnie goes running down through the mall. \nINT. MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING \nDennis and Ronnie are sitting and Mark stands over them. They're looking at the security tapes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDetective Harrison knocks on the door and walks in. Ronnie stands up to greet him. \nRONNIE Good to see you, brother. Looks like the old team is getting together to crack one more case. \nRonnie gives Detective Harrison a hug. \nRONNIE I'm ready to go to war with you. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Thanks for waking me up this morning, Ronnie. \nRONNIE I've already checked the Security tapes. They didn't catch a thing. Someone must have broken in here and turned them off. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON My team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry. I've also checked out the crime scene, but we didn't see any fingerprints on the glass. The suspect was probably wearing gloves. \nMARK That doesn't sound good.   How did they do it? \nRONNIE Laser technology. \nRONNIE Hello, Saddamn. \nSADDAMN What the fuck you want, Ronnie? \nRONNIE I want your ass to face the music is what I want. \nSADDAMN Don't come any further, bitch. The restraining order says 20 feet so just back the fuck up. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but just let me handle this. (to Saddamn) Have a good day, sir. \nRONNIE So you're just gonna let him slip right through your fingers? \nDETECTIVE HARRISON I have no reason to make him a suspect. \nRONNIE No reason? Look at him. There's every reason in the goddamn book. \nSADDAMN Why are you saying that, man? \nRONNIE I think it's obvious, Saddamn. \nSADDAMN That's fucked up. You're racist, man. \nRONNIE You're not even black. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, stop. We're finished here. Now if you're going to tag along, I'm gonna need you to just stay back; are we clear? \nRONNIE Sure, sorry.   We're crystal. \nDetective Harrison walks away. Ronnie follows, but takes one more look at Saddamn, who flips Ronnie off. \nSaddamn goes back to hollering at girls. \nSADDAMN What's up, girl, you got a boyfriend? Free cell phones with a month trial and I throw in my phone number for free. \nINT. MALL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY \nRonnie stands nearby as Detective Harrison questions an old Mexican JANITOR, who stands by his cart of cleaning products. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Did you let anybody borrow your keys? \nJANITOR No, senor. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Have you seen anything suspicious? \nJANITOR No, senor. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Okay, sir.   Thank you for your time. \nRONNIE Alright, I believe I can be of some assistance here. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, we talked about this. \nRONNIE This is a special circumstance. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDETECTIVE HARRISON What special circumstance? \nRONNIE Communication skills, watch and learn. \nRonnie steps into the forefront. \nRONNIE Que pasa? \nJANITOR Long drawn out conversation in Spanish? \nRONNIE Como? \nJANITOR More Spanish dialogue. \nRONNIE Si. (to Harrison) Yeah, this guy definitely did it. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON What did he say? \nRONNIE I don't know, I don't speak Spanish, but judging from his tonal inflections, it's safe to say that he's hiding something. The only question is where. (to Janitor) Okay, Ramon, I'm giving you one chance and one chance only to come clean. Or else Detective Harrison is going to come over to your house and deport your whole family back to Mexico. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON No, I'm not. \nRONNIE Good cop, bad cop, just play along. (to Ramon) Where are you hiding the jewels? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJANITOR No se. \nINT. MALL - SEARS - DAY \nRonnie and Detective Harrison are in the hardware department talking to the SEARS MANAGER. Detective Harrison sits on the ground. He has completely given up on the investigation at this point, as Ronnie controls it all. \nRonnie picks up a hammer. \nRONNIE Now, maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm the smartest man alive, but it seems kind of convenient to me that you sell hammers like this one that could easily be used to smash a glass case in, oh say, a jewelry store. \nSEARS MANAGER Couldn't you smash the glass with anything? \nRONNIE You really think you're gonna talk your way out of this one? \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY \nRonnie is hanging out with Dennis and the Bouncer from O'Charley's. Behind him, Nell works the counter at Cinnabon. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE You guys should have been there today. We were just solving shit left and right. I mean, that's what this job is supposed to be like. Busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from the fountain has its rewards, but really getting in there and closing cases is where it's at. It's rewarding too because at the end of the day, you know you've done something good for the world. \nBOUNCER What are we doing here, Ronnie? I thought you said they were giving away free Chick-fil-A sandwiches. \nRONNIE Well -- What is your name anyway? \nBOUNCER Charles. \nRONNIE Well, my young apprentice. I called you here today because as Head of Mall Security, I have decided that it's time to take protection to the next level. In other words, I alone cannot combat this recent crime wave. In order to help me in my personal journey, I have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers. So, for now on, Dennis, my right-hand man, you will be in charge of solving the case of who is robbing the mall. Little Chucky, you will be on the case of the Pervert. You are both to collect data and provide it to me. I will analyze the data, draw conclusions, and solve these crimes as well as coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies. \nBOUNCER Since we're going to be doing a lot of the work and you're going to be solving the crimes, do we at least get paid? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE You can't measure honor in dollars and cents. \nRonnie looks over at the Cinnabon and Nell waves to him. Ronnie smiles back and waves at Nell. \nBOUNCER Is that your girlfriend or something, Ronnie? \nRONNIE Who me? Nah, man. Why?     What do you think of her? \nBOUNCER She's not my type, but that's just me. \nRONNIE Yeah, but, you don't think she's kind of hot? \nBOUNCER Are you blind? Give me a break. Wait, are you sure she's not your girlfriend? \nRONNIE Fuck no. There's no way I'd date that... person who's obviously not hot. \nNell waves again, but Ronnie just kind of turns away, ignoring her. \nRONNIE Anyway, our new unit will operate under the name, 'Special Elite Task Force.' You will answer directly to me and no one else. Now, let's all put our hands in the middle and do a unifying cheer. \nRonnie puts his hand out.     Dennis puts his in as well. Charles isn't sure. \nBOUNCER You're gonna hook me up with a job, right? \nRONNIE Seven even.   I promise. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCharles puts his hand in as well. \nRONNIE One, two, three, TASK FORCE! \nRonnie is the only one who gets into it.      It's a weak-ass cheer. \nRONNIE Okay, so now I say we all take a celebratory trip to Sears because, as we all know, today is half- price day on all automotive parts for mall employees. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - DAY \nSLOW MOTION BAD-ASS SHOT. \nThe \"Elite Task Force\" walks down the mall as if they were the baddest ass-kicking team on the planet. They walk united and unopposed. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT \nRonnie tacks up pictures of all of the      robbery \"suspects\" on a bulletin board. It's pictures of       Saddamn and the Devil Worshipper guy. Beside him is a       sketch of the Pervert. The images are on the bottom       points of a Pyramid. \nRONNIE I lied.   It is a date. \nBefore she can argue, Ronnie guns the golf cart and drives away. \nEXT. MALL - MORNING \nRonnie sees Stevie and the Skaters doing hand rails down a ramp while mall patrons try to get by without getting nailed by flying skateboards. Ronnie drives up on his golf cart. \nSTEVIE Our suspension is over. \nRONNIE I'm not here for that.    I need to talk to you. \nA giant BODYGUARD with a shaved head stands up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBODYGUARD Anything you want to say to Stevie, you can say to me, motherfucker! \nRONNIE Who the fuck are you? \nSTEVIE This is my cousin, Roy.      He's a boxer. \nBODYGUARD You got a fuckin' problem, bitch?! \nRonnie reaches into his belt and produces a can of mace. He sprays it into the eyes of the Bodyguard. The guy goes down and starts SCREAMING IN PAIN. \nBODYGUARD My eyes! \nSTEVIE Jesus, Ronnie, what the fuck are you doing? \nRONNIE I need a favor. \nSTEVIE I'm listening. \nRONNIE As you know, we've had a lot of crime around here lately. Between the Flasher and all the break-ins, I've decided to go to the streets. Frankly, I'm looking for a stool pigeon and you're just the right person. \nSTEVIE Why would I want to help you? \nRONNIE I could make it worth your while. You like skating at the mall. I could allow you to skate here whenever you wanted. In exchange, you keep your eyes peeled and provide me with any information you come across as to the identity of the perpetrators. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSTEVIE Sorry, dude, but I'm no snitch. Go find somebody else to do your dirty work. \nRONNIE Well, let me put it another way. If you don't help me, I'm gonna spread your little butt cheeks and stick this flashlight up your ass. But like for real. Like I really will do that. This is the new me talking and I get what I need, you understand me, Stevie? \nSTEVIE Alright, dude, I understand, you sick fuck. \nRONNIE Cool. In that case, have fun shreadin'. \nRonnie gets into his Golf Cart and drives off. Stevie looks down at the Boxer who is still on the ground. \nSTEVIE Stop crying, Roy. \nStevie starts skating. \nINT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY \nRonnie walks into the Food Court and sees Nell waiting at their table with Ronnie's morning Cinnabon. He takes a deep breath and heads over. \nNELL Hey, sweetie -- Oh, I'm sorry, good morning, Officer Barnhardt. \nRONNIE Good morning, Nell. \nNELL Where were you last night? I tried to call, but your mom said you weren't home from work yet. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Look, I got to talk to you about something. I'm not really sure how to put this. Let's see. If you drove a Toyota. \nNELL I drive a Ford. \nRONNIE I know, but let's just pretend you drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota runs really good. It always starts when you need it to and it gets good gas mileage and you don't have to do much to maintain it. Then you get a really important job like Astronaut, no that won't work, you get a job as the head of Wall Street. Well, you may really like that Toyota, but you're going to feel weird about driving it to work every day, right? Now let's say that somebody offers you a chance to get rid of that Toyota and instead you get a Ferrari. It may be more expensive and harder to drive, but I mean, it just looks good as hell. What would you do? \nNELL I don't get it. \nRONNIE You would trade up, Nell. Well, that's exactly what I'm doing. \nNELL Are you thinking about getting a new car? \nRONNIE No, Nell, I'm getting a new girlfriend. \nNELL What?!   Who? \nRONNIE This girl, Brandi. \nMOM Really, I thought you and Nell were going to get married some day. \nRONNIE I did too. But then I met this girl Brandi and she swept me off my feet. \nMOM Well, I always liked Nell, but as long as you're happy, Ronnie, that's all I care about. \nRONNIE I actually feel kind of bad about Nell, but I figure that I can pour all the sadness into Brandi and just really rely on her for my happiness instead of Nell. \nMOM That sounds wonderful.   Is she pretty? \nRONNIE She is, Mom. She's the most perfect girl in the whole world. \nMOM I remember when your father picked me up for our first date. I swear he was the most handsome man that I had ever laid eyes on. I knew right then and there that this would be the man that I married. \nRONNIE I hope that happens tonight. \nMOM It will, Ronnie. Then you'll have to give her a ring like the one your father gave me. \nRonnie's Mom holds up her finger for Ronnie.       It's a giant yellow/cottony-looking diamond ring. \nRONNIE Is that a yellow diamond? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMOM It's a glass diamond.   This is how it looks now. \nRONNIE Mom, why did Dad leave? \nMOM Well, he kind of freaked out when you were born. You had so many special needs that he just couldn't handle the pressure. One day, he just couldn't take it anymore. \nRONNIE Do you think it was my fault that Dad left? \nMOM Definitely. You don't think it was mine do you? \nRONNIE Well, I didn't know, with the drinking and all. \nMOM Nope, it was all you. \nRonnie nods. \nMOM I love you, Ronnie. \nRONNIE I love you, too, Mom. \nINT. CAPTAIN O'LANDERS - NIGHT \nThe restaurant is the cheesiest of all sea food restaurants. Think one step down from Red Lobster. Ronnie sits across the table from Brandi. She chugs one of those giant frozen drinks, killing it in one gulp. \nRONNIE Damn, that was pretty impressive. \nBRANDI Yeah, work's been pissing me off, so I just need to blow off some steam. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Well, Brandi, can I just say that you look absolutely beautiful tonight. \nBRANDI Yeah, I know. (calling to waiter) Nurse! Get me another -- (to Ronnie) You got this, right? \nRONNIE Yeah, yeah.   No problem. \nBRANDI Nurse! Bring me another and keep 'em coming. (to Ronnie) I think it's funny to call the waitress nurse. \nRonnie takes a pill bottle out of his pocket.       He opens it up and pops a pill. \nBRANDI Hey, what's that? \nRONNIE Oh, it's nothing. \nBRANDI Don't be stingy, what the fuck is that? \nRONNIE It's just a pill I'm supposed to take. \nBRANDI Let me see. \nRonnie hands the pills to Brandi. \nBRANDI Where the fuck did you find these? \nRONNIE The Doctor. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRANDI Damn, Ronnie, Klonopin. I'm impressed. This is the good shit. I didn't know you partied like this. \nRONNIE Yeah, I guess I party like this every four to six hours as needed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Seems   like a big bag of roses would   be more love than just one, but I   guess you're the expert. Gimme   one. \nThe Flower Salesman takes a single red rose from the case and hands it to Ronnie. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nBrandi is behind the counter gossiping with Bruce. Ronnie holds his rose and watches them from a distance. He takes a deep breath and then walks to the counter. \nRONNIE Brandi? \nBRANDI What are you doing here? \nRONNIE I came here to see you. And to present you with this single red rose. It symbolizes 'love.' \nBRANDI Ronnie, that's really... uncalled for. \nRONNIE Well, after last night,   I just wanted you to know that   it wasn't just some fling to me.    It meant something special and I   felt it deep in my soul. \nBRUCE You fucked the Security Guard? (PLAYFUL) You are such a little slut! \nBRANDI Oh, like you've never been drunk, Bruce! \nBrandi grabs Ronnie and pulls him off to the side. \nBRANDI Ronnie, look. I got to be honest with you. I barely remember last night. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE I remember it for the both of us. \nBRANDI Okay, see here's the thing. I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna come on out with it. Ronnie, I could never date you seriously. I mean, you're a security guard. \nRONNIE I'm the head of Mall Security. \nBRANDI Exactly. The point is, I don't really see myself being with that. Like ever. You know what I mean? \nRONNIE Brandi, I know exactly what you mean. And I just want to thank you for being honest. You're telling me I'm not living up to my full potential in life. It's funny, because I've been feeling like this for quite some time. I guess I just needed that extra little push to get me over this hurdle I've been stuck on. How can you be with a man who isn't living the life he was meant to? \nBRANDI Yeah, something like that. And just you know, you're a security guard at the mall and it's like, come on, you know? \nRONNIE I don't like it, Brandi, but I do understand. I promise you this. Next time you see me, I will be wearing a uniform that will make you proud. I will be the man that you will be honored to call your life's love. \nBRANDI Don't bet on it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE I will though. I'll bet everything I have on you. Now I ask you for one favor. Although I am unworthy, will you accept this rose from me anyway? \nBRANDI I can't do that. And tell your girlfriend to stop coming by my work and threatening me and shit. \nBrandi walks away, leaving Ronnie there holding his flower. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nRonnie sits at a small table and waits patiently. Then a POLICEMAN walks into the room. Ronnie stands to shake his hand. \nRONNIE I'm here to become a police officer. \nPOLICEMAN We're always on the hunt for new recruits. Do you have at least a high school diploma? \nRONNIE I have a GED. \nPOLICEMAN We usually prefer an actual diploma, but GED is technically acceptable. Are you a citizen of the United States? \nRONNIE You bet your ass I am. \nPOLICEMAN Okay, Mr. Barnhardt, there are several steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police academy. Physical evaluation, psychological test, background check. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPOLICEMAN (CONT'D) If you pass these tests, you will be admitted to the police academy. Now, I like to tell all new recruits that they should complete a ride along before making this decision. It's where you actually ride along with a real police officer during a routine patrol. It helps give you an idea of the kind of situations you'll be dealing with. Sound good? \nRONNIE That sounds fun. Sign me up. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nRonnie sits in the unmarked police car with Detective Harrison. \nRONNIE It's like it was meant to be. You behind the wheel. Me riding shotgun. Two brothers of the badge unite to form the ultimate crime-stopping combo. I'm psyched to be here, Harrison. Thank you for the opportunity. \nDetective Harrison keeps on driving without looking back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CROSSROADS - A SHORT TIME LATER \nRonnie looks petrified as he stands guard.       A BUM stands off to the side staring Ronnie down. \nRonnie waves to the bum. The bum runs his finger under his throat. Ronnie tries to ignore him. \nA group of KIDS walk by Ronnie talking loudly. \nRONNIE Hey, no horse play. You guys get on home. \nKID You want some crack? \nRONNIE No, I don't want any crack. In fact, I didn't want to do this, but you leave me no choice in the matter. I'm placing you under citizen's arrest. \nRonnie grabs the little Kid by the shoulders to restrain him. \nKID Let me go, motherfucker! \nRONNIE I place you under citizen's arrest for the crime of selling a Schedule 1 Narcotic. You have the right to remain silent... \nUnbeknownst to Ronnie, Gang Members start walking up behind him. It's like that scene in Training Day where all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street with guns and shit. They come up behind him as he speaks to the kids... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE ... If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Now I guess we just wait here for my ride to come back. \nRonnie turns around to look for Harrison's return, but instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of pissed-off GANG MEMBERS. \nGANG MEMBER #1 That's my little brother you got there. \nRONNIE Who, this little guy right here? \nGANG MEMBER #1 That's right. \nRONNIE Well, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but it appears that your little brother has tried to sell me illegal drugs. I know it's hard for you to hear that. \nGANG MEMBER #1 He works for me, motherfucker! \nRONNIE Is that so? Well then, it looks like you got one less employee because I'm taking little brother down. I'll die right here before I let crime prevail. \nThe Gang Members all pull out their guns and point them at Ronnie. \nRONNIE (to the little Kid) Free to go, little brother. My mistake completely. Good luck with the crack. \nThe little Kid runs off. \nRONNIE Alright, so I guess I'll be seeing you folks. \nThe Gang Members stand in Ronnie's way and cock their guns. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGANG MEMBER #2 Yo, waste this pig, Tone. \nRONNIE Oh, no. That's really not necessary, Tone. \nGANG MEMBER #2 Do it, man. \nGang Member #1 puts the gun right up to Ronnie's head. \nRONNIE Oh, Jesus, I don't want to die. Don't let me die, don't do it! \nRonnie goes down on his knees. \nRONNIE No, please!   I'm sorry! \nRonnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod. He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick. Ronnie's begging was a trap. Ronnie pops up and begins dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast precision. \nRonnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja. Gang Member #1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker punch, busting his nose wide open. \nRonnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight with Gang Member #1. He starts kicking Ronnie's ass. Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member #1 starts stomping Ronnie. \nRonnie grabs Gang Member #1's leg and twists it. He takes him down. Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins beating him senseless. \nSLOW MOTION: Ronnie stands up and looks around at the pool of beaten bodies. This is Ronnie at his most primal and also at his best. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nDetective Harrison is eating doughnuts and laughing with a bunch of other COPS. \n(CONTINUED) \nMARK Do you have any experience, son? \nCHARLES Not really. \nRONNIE Um, sir, I have personally been training young Charles for weeks now in preparation for this day. The kid kind of looks up to me. I'm some what of a big brother to the little guy. \nCharles kind of looks at Ronnie like he's crazy. \nMARK Alright, it's actually not a bad idea. It might make our Security more visible so we can give people the illusion that we're on top of this. \nRonnie winks at Charles. \nCHARLES Thank you, Mark. \nMARK Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if this crime doesn't come to an end pretty soon, we're gonna have to let someone go. I mean, you've always done a great job for me, but the truth is, someone is going to have to take the fall. You're the one who wanted to be Head of Mall Security and quite frankly, I just bought my wife a new Cadillac, so let's just say it won't be me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE With Charles on my team, I can now devote more time to the robbery and Pervert case. I plan on having these wrapped up by the end of the week. \nMark laughs to himself. \nRONNIE Why'd you just laugh? \nMARK It's nothing.    Have fun, Ronnie. \nRonnie looks at Charles. \nRONNIE Did I say something funny? \nCHARLES Let's go, Ronnie. \nRonnie and Charles take off. \nINT. MALL - DAY \nRonnie and Charles stand in the middle of the floor and supervise the \"mall walkers.\" \nCHARLES Be careful, guys. Nice and slow. \nRONNIE That's not bad, but you need to learn to speak in a more authoritative voice. Watch this. Slow it down! Slow it down! You've already received one verbal, don't make me issue a second! (back to Charles) See, you can't be intimidated. You have to make them respect you. \nCHARLES Ronnie, you know I really want to thank you for the job. You're a man of your word. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE No problem, my young student. So, I got something to tell you. Keep this between us until it's official, but I don't think I'm going to be here for much longer. \nCHARLES You're quitting? But you love this job. \nRONNIE I do love it, but it looks like someone is going to be joining the police force. \nCHARLES The real police? \nRONNIE They're calling me up. It's basically a done deal. Just a little red tape is the only thing keeping me from carrying a gun. \nCHARLES I didn't even know you wanted to become a Cop. \nRONNIE It's always been my job. The Mall thing is great training, but it has its limitations. Some stars are just meant to shine brighter than others. \nCHARLES Congrats, brother. \nRONNIE (to a mall walker) HEY, SLOW IT DOWN, LADY! \nA Mall Walker slows her pace.        She turns around and Ronnie sees that it's Nell. \nRONNIE Nell? \nNELL Hey, Ronnie. \nRONNIE What are you doing? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNELL Nothing, just getting in shape. \nRONNIE Well, that's okay, I guess.   Just watch your speed, okay? \nNell waves and walks on. \nCHARLES Isn't that your girlfriend? \nRONNIE Ex. \nCHARLES She looked good. \nRONNIE Why would you say that? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMOM You know why. I just don't want to see you get hurt. It's my job to protect you from the bullshit. \nRONNIE Mom, I appreciate it, but I'm going to make it as a police officer. I'm tired of coming in second all the time. Everybody in life gets to go for their goals, why should I be any different? \nMOM I know. Just be careful is all. You've got a good heart and I don't want to see it broken. \nRONNIE Okay, Mom.   I hear you. \nMOM And, Ronnie, one more thing. \nRONNIE What's that, Mom? \nIn the tub, a bunch of bubbles plop to the surface. \nRONNIE Mom!   That's gross! \nMOM (drunk laughing) That's right! Now you got to smell it! \nRONNIE Mom. \nEXT. POLICE ACADEMY - DAY \nThe Police Academy is full of energy as new recruits pour up the steps and into the building, eager to start their training. \nRonnie comes walking up and takes a long look at the building. Ronnie smiles to himself and heads up the stairs. \nRonnie reaches the top where Detective Harrison is waiting. Ronnie stops. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Ronnie Barnhardt reporting for duty. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON I can see that. Listen, I don't really know how to say this, but we're not going to be able to let you join the academy. \nRONNIE What?!   Why not? \nDETECTIVE HARRISON It seems you had a little trouble passing the minimum requirements. \nRONNIE Did I fail one of the tests? \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Well, yes, actually, you failed the psychological exam. \nRONNIE No! \nDETECTIVE HARRISON It says... (reads from the form) That Ronnie Barnhardt shows warning signs of delusion and allowing him to join the force puts his life and the lives of others in jeopardy. \nRONNIE Detective Harrison, you've got to believe me. I'm completely sound. This has got to be a mistake. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, I personally did your background check and this is the fifth time you've been turned down for the police academy. \nRONNIE You guys keep records on that? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDETECTIVE HARRISON We sure do. Look, I tried to talk to them, but there's no way they're gonna let you in. I'm sorry, but your dreams of becoming a Police Officer just aren't going to happen. \nRONNIE I understand. Thanks for believing in me, Detective. And just for the record, I'm not crazy. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON Take care, Ronnie. \nDetective Harrison goes inside and closes the doors on Ronnie. \nRonnie stands outside of the closed academy by himself. \nThe CAMERA PUSHES INTO Ronnie and SPINS UPSIDE-DOWN. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING \nRonnie is behind the locked gate to the food court, but it looks like he is behind bars in a prison. Ronnie slides the bars up and walks out. \nINT. MALL - DAY Ronnie walks through the mall and looks at the lights of the different shops. Everything looks colorful and weird. Ronnie is in his own head. This isn't the exciting world as before, now it's a disgusting fabricated make-believe land. \nTIME LAPSE: A DAY SPEEDS BY AS RONNIE WALKS LIKE A ZOMBIE THROUGH IT ALL. \nINT. MALL - FOOD COURT - NIGHT \nThe mall is kind of winding down for the day.      The stores are closing and people are going home. \nRONNIE What do you mean? \nSTEVIE I don't know.    You just seem kind of sad. \nRONNIE Nah, man, I'm fine. I mean, I'm catchin' perverts and protecting this mall and just you know, really livin' the dream. \nSTEVIE That's cool.    Look, man, you want to get high? \nRONNIE No, I don't want to get high. \nSTEVIE That's cool. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe conversation dies down and the two just kind of sit there. \nRONNIE And by the way, if I see you getting high, I will call the police and have your criminal ass arrested. Don't you fuckin' ever mistake my kindness for weakness. I hate drugs and I hate you too. \nSTEVIE Fine, you fucking dick. \nSteve stands up to leave.    Ronnie sits there looking sad. \nEXT. MALL - NIGHT \nRonnie sits in his golf cart staring at the mall as the last of the customers leave. That's when Ronnie sees Brandi come out of the door. Brandi looks around and darts across the parking lot. \nRonnie follows Brandi's path and tries to catch up with her. \nEXT. MALL - NIGHT \nRonnie drives around, but he can't find Brandi anywhere. \nRonnie sees a lone black car at the outer edge of the parking lot. He pulls his golf cart over and climbs out. \nRonnie creeps up to the car and peers in the window. Inside, Ronnie sees Brandi and Detective Harrison banging like a couple of wild animals. \nRonnie jumps back in shock! \nINT. DETECTIVE HARRISON'S CAR - NIGHT \nBrandi stops humping Detective Harrison. \nBRANDI Shhhh. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON What is it? \nBRANDI I thought I heard something. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDetective Harrison looks out of the window. He doesn't see anything. He climbs back on top of Brandi. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON It's nothing. \nOUT OF NOWHERE, A FLASHLIGHT BREAKS THE BACK WINDOW OF THE CAR. \nEXT. MALL - NIGHT \nRonnie runs around Detective Harrison's car wielding a flashlight like a mad man. \nRONNIE HARRISON!!! \nRonnie beats the shit out of Harrison's car.        He smashes headlights, mirrors and fenders. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nHarrison and Brandi duck down. \nBRANDI Shit! \nDETECTIVE HARRISON That motherfucker is crazy. \nBRANDI Well, you're the fucking cop.   Do something. \nDETECTIVE HARRISON You're right.    Okay, here it goes. \nHarrison reaches over Brandi and opens her door. \nBRANDI What the fuck are you doing?! \nHarrison pushes Brandi out of the car and shuts himself back in. \nOUTSIDE \nRonnie sees Brandi and stops pummeling the car. \n(CONTINUED) \nEXT. JAIL - DAY \nRonnie walks up the steps that lead to the local jail. \nINT. JAIL - DAY \nRonnie walks into one of those booths where you can talk to a prisoner on the opposite side of a Plexiglas divider. Ronnie sits down in wait. Then, two GUARDS appear escorting a handcuffed Dennis. Dennis takes a seat and picks up the phone. \nDENNIS What's up, Ronnie? How you doing? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE I've been better. You? \nDENNIS I'm holding it down in here. \nRONNIE Yeah, I heard they finally caught up with you. \nDENNIS I know. I should have hit Mexico, but, you know, I got stoned and just kind of kicked with this girl in Kannapolis for a while. \nRONNIE You know they fired me when they found out you were the one who robbed the mall. \nDENNIS Shit, dog.    Sorry about that. \nRONNIE It's cool, but I need to know why you did it. \nDENNIS I told you.   I'm an outlaw. \nRONNIE Come on, Dennis. \nDENNIS Man, you want to know the real reason? \nRONNIE Yeah. \nDENNIS Alright, I'll tell you. Man, that gig was one of the best jobs I ever had. I got to wear a uniform, I could smoke weed whenever I wanted. For once in my life, I felt like I was actually somebody. I know most people don't think it's shit, but I really loved it. Then, all of a sudden, I find out that your ass got promoted over me. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDENNIS (CONT'D) After all I put into it, you're the one that makes it to Head of Mall Security. You know what it's like to get passed over, Ronnie? So I got pissed off. I started robbing the joint as a way to get at them for what they did to me. But you know what, Ronnie? \nRONNIE What's that? \nDENNIS You ever love a girl so much that you can't break up with her, so the only thing you can do when she pisses you off is smack her in the goddamn face? \nRONNIE No, Dennis, I haven't. \nDENNIS Well, I have. And that's pretty much how I felt about the job. \nRONNIE Thanks for talking to me, Dennis. \nDENNIS Well, it's the least I could do after knocking you out and all. \nRonnie starts to hang up the phone. \nDENNIS Hey, Ronnie. \nRONNIE Yeah, Dennis. \nDENNIS Bail me out of here, old friend. \nRONNIE I can't do it, Dennis. You're now a criminal who stopped caring, but my crime is that I care too much. \nRonnie hangs up the phone and walks out. \nINT. MALL - DAY \nRonnie comes into the mall and makes his way down the center of it, feeling naked without his uniform. \nCharles, now wearing a mall security uniform, comes out and stops Ronnie. \nCHARLES Ronnie, what are you doing back here? \nRONNIE I just came to talk to Nell. Don't get your panties in a wad, I'm just here as any normal patron. \nCHARLES Ronnie, dude, I've been all fucked up in the head. I feel like shit about what happened. I mean, here I am, just looking to shuck responsibility and I ended up hurting you in the process. Look, I should have been honest with you. I don't give two shits about this stupid job. But you do. \nRONNIE It's okay, Charles. \nCHARLES I've decided I'm going back to college. Getting stoned and studying beats this any day. I realize that now. I realize that there aren't any jobs where you can avoid hard choices. Anyway, take as long as you want at the mall. I'll keep Mark off your back. \nRONNIE Thanks, Charles. \nINT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY \nRonnie sees Nell sitting down and eating a Cinnabon. Ronnie takes a seat at her table. \nNELL Ronnie, what are you doing here? \nRonnie lays on the ground and sees Ramon laughing against a wall with a mop in his hands. \nRONNIE Okay, Ramon, we're fucking even! \nRonnie picks himself up and starts running again. \nCUT TO: \nTHE PERVERT \nruns past VICTORIA'S SECRET. He stops at the doorway and as if he can't resist, flashes the ladies in the store. He takes off running again. \nCUT TO: \nRONNIE \nas he runs by the RECORD STORE, which of course is BLASTING MUSIC. Ronnie stops at the doorway. \nRONNIE Turn it down.     Turn it down. \nThe Record Store guy turns the MUSIC DOWN.   Ronnie goes back to his chase. \nCUT TO: \nTHE PERVERT \nruns past Mark.    He looks around at all the people staring. \nMARK Okay, show's over. Enjoy your shopping experience at Carolina Mall. \nRonnie runs past Mark. \nMARK Jesus. (calling out) Charles! \nCharles comes running up. \nCHARLES What is it? \nMARK Call the police. And go get Ronnie. \nCHARLES He's trying to help. \nMARK Just do what I ask you. \nCharles runs after them. Ronnie sees Charles coming and runs faster. Charles is moving in on him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHARLES Hey, Ronnie! \nRonnie turns around to see Charles as he flings him a giant flashlight. Ronnie catches it. \nRONNIE Fuck yeah! \nRonnie starts running again, but this time, he's a little more together. \nCUT TO: \nTHE PERVERT \nhas made his way through the whole mall at this point, but Ronnie is right on his ass. The Pervert is heading toward the DEPARTMENT STORE. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nThe Pervert comes barreling in and the ladies at the perfume and make-up counters SCREAM. \nHe looks like he's charging straight at Brandi.    He's getting closer. \nBOOM! Ronnie comes in from the side and nails the Pervert with the flashlight. Ronnie jumps on top of the Perv and beats the ever-living shit out of him. This is a vision of a man leaving all out on the field. \nRonnie stops pounding and looks up. He sees Brandi staring at him. Ronnie is overcome by anger and beats on the Pervert harder than ever before. Finally, Charles comes in and pulls Ronnie off of him. \nA huge crowd has gathered around. Ronnie has blood all over him. Ronnie picks the Pervert up and holds him tightly by the arms. Mark comes running up. \nCHARLES You want to report this to the police. \nRONNIE Hell no.   I'm taking him down myself. \nRonnie starts to walk away with the Pervert. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARK Hey, Ronnie. \nRonnie stops and turns around.       Mark tosses Ronnie a set of keys. \nMARK Good job, Ronnie. \n", "test1_input": "CONTINUED: \nRONNIE Brandi, I had a wonderful time tonight. \nBRANDI I'm so fucking shit-faced. \nThey kiss again, but when they do, Brandi pukes all over the place. It's a disgusting puke and there's vomit on her cheek and stuff. Ronnie holds her head for her. \nRONNIE Are you okay? \nBRANDI My breath smells like asshole. \nRonnie looks longingly into her eyes. \nRONNIE I love you, Brandi. \nBRANDI I think I've got puke in my teeth. \nRONNIE I don't care. \nRonnie kisses Brandi passionately on the mouth. He walks her inside the house. On the way in, she falls over. Ronnie helps her up. He carries her into the house where the make-love spot is. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY \nRonnie is with Dennis in the food court. Ronnie is smiling, but Dennis isn't saying a word as usual. \nRONNIE Don't look at me like that, Dennis. I told you I wouldn't talk. \nRonnie sits back, but he can't help a giant grin on his face. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE I'm serious, Dennis. A gentleman never kisses and tells. So, just stop with all the pressure because it's just not gonna happen. \nRonnie keeps on grinning at Dennis. \nRONNIE Okay, fine, you son of a bitch, you want details, I'll give you details. I had sex with Brandi last night. \nDennis and Ronnie high-five. \nRONNIE It was amazing. I mean, I've never experienced anything like it. I've been with a girl or two. \nDennis stares at Ronnie. \nRONNIE Okay, fine, I've been with a girl, but let me tell you, this was so much better. You know how many times we did it? Twice! BAM! BAM! BAM! \nOVER AT THE CINNABON STAND \nNell, who looks like she's been crying nonstop, stuffs a whole Cinnabon into her face. As it fills her cheeks, she looks over to Ronnie's table and sees Ronnie making thrusting motions at the table. Nell swallows, stuffs another Cinnabon in, then storms out of the Food Court. \nBACK AT RONNIE'S TABLE \nRonnie continues to talk to Dennis. \nRONNIE But I got to tell you, Dennis. It was steamy and sexy, but more than anything, I should tell you that it's her soul that I fell for the most. She got pretty tanked, but I could just really tell that she's a good person. The kind of person that I could see myself with. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE (CONT'D) Look, I'm gonna get out of here. There's a lot of people I need to tell about this, so I'll catch up with you later. Oh, and I almost forgot, keep your eyes peeled for crime and stuff. \nRonnie leaves the table. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nNell watches Brandi as she pops a couple of aspirin behind the makeup counter. She takes a deep breath and walks up to the counter. \nNELL Excuse me. \nBRANDI How may I help you? \nNELL I need to talk to you. \nBRANDI What is it, honey? Let me guess. You're looking for something to take care of those blackheads and hide that puffiness under your eyes. I've got just the thing. \nNELL No, that's not it.    Well, how much is it? \nBRANDI Fifty dollars for the bottle. \nNELL Okay, I'll take it. \nBrandi begins to ring up the cream. \nNELL Listen, I know you're Ronnie's new girlfriend. \n", "test1_true": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNELL It's okay. I know he left me to be with you and I accept that. \nBRANDI I don't know who you've been talking to, but it's safe to say that you're fucking trippin'. \nNELL It's fine really. It's going to take a while for me to get over it, but I'll be okay. \nNell starts to get all teary-eyed. She picks up a Kleenex from a box on the counter and wipes her eyes. \nBRANDI Oh fuckin' Lord. This is disgusting. \nNELL I'm sorry. \nBRANDI Pull it together. This is how you run around all the time? Have some self-respect. No wonder your man left you. Who the hell would want to be around this shit all day? \nNell pulls herself together. \nNELL Jesus teaches us to forgive. And I forgive you for what you did to me when you stole my boyfriend. Plus, I feel pretty confident that you'll end up burning in hell because of the various evil ways you live your life and that brings me some satisfaction. But I just want to tell you that Ronnie is a good person. He does a lot of stupid stuff, but really, he wants to do good for the world. I want you to know that if you hurt him and ruin his heart, I will personally come down here and kick the ever living shit out of you. \nNell walks away. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRANDI You better fuckin' run, bitch! \nNell turns around and starts storming toward Brandi. Brandi throws her hands up, frightened. \nBRANDI I'm just kidding. \nNell stops charging and walks away. Nell walks past Bruce who is helping a customer at the end of the counter. \nNELL It's not too late to change your ways. \nBRUCE Okay.   Thanks. \nNell walks out of the department store. \nINT. MALL - FLOWER SHOP - DAY \nRonnie looks at the colorful flowers in the glass refrigerator. The FLOWER SALESMAN walks up to Ronnie. \nFLOWER SALESMAN Ronnie, I've been expecting you. \nRONNIE You have? \nFLOWER SALESMAN Oh yeah, I heard about last night. Brandi is quite the woman. Congratulations, my friend. Or should I say, welcome to the club? \nThe Flower Salesman winks and starts laughing. Ronnie doesn't. It gets weird so the Flower Salesman stops. \nRONNIE What color of roses do the women like anyway? \nFLOWER SALESMAN Well, it depends on what you are trying to say. The white roses symbolize innocence and purity. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Yeah, we're way past the color white if you know what I mean. What about the yellow ones? \nFLOWER SALESMAN Joy, happiness, appreciation. \nRONNIE I don't even know what to make of that. \nFLOWER SALESMAN The pink rose means thank you. \nRONNIE Next. \nFLOWER SALESMAN The red rose is the most powerful. It symbolizes love. \nRONNIE Why didn't you just say that?    I'm a busy man here. \nFLOWER SALESMAN I'm sorry. \nRONNIE Forget it. Give me a big bag of the red ones. \nFLOWER SALESMAN Um, can I ask a question? \nRONNIE Go ahead. \nFLOWER SALESMAN Do you really like Brandi? \nRONNIE I've only been on one date with her, but I could see myself being with her for all of eternity. \nFLOWER SALESMAN Well, in that case, the greatest symbol of love is just a single red rose. \n", "test1_id": 1059, "test2_input": "This is the REAL DENNIS and for the first time ever, he speaks... \nDENNIS (high ghetto voice) I've been waiting on you to get on my page this whole time. You look at this mall as a Kingdom?! Shit! I look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence. You put on that uniform every morning, but what are you really protecting? Commerce and corporations and money. Well I say, fuck that! I'm a fucking outlaw and I'm going to live that until the day I die. Now, I can show you the way, but you've got to be willing to accept it. So I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are you ready for a trip to the other side? \nRONNIE You're goddamn right I'm ready. \nDENNIS Alright then.    Let's party. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DUMPSTERS - DAY \nDennis and Ronnie hang in the back of the mall by the dumpsters. Dennis sucks down a fat joint. He passes it to Ronnie. \nDENNIS So, yeah, usually I take a joint straight to the head before I start work in this motherfucker, but on really stressful days, I like to get drunk too. \nDennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down. Ronnie is still staring at the joint. Finally he takes a puff and begins violently coughing. He finally stops. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Fuck it, give me the bottle. \nDennis hands Ronnie the bottle and he takes a big swig. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - DAY \nRonnie and Dennis stand against a wall while they check out booties of various shapes and sizes on all of the girls that walk by. \nDENNIS So then I usually come in here and perv out on girls for about an hour or two. I hooked up twice last week. One was this Asian chick and the other was this mom. She wasn't that hot, but what else do I got to do? \nTwo high school girls walk by. \nDENNIS Sweet Jesus in the morning. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nRonnie and Dennis are hanging in a dressing room. \nDENNIS Dressing rooms are a great place to hide out, because nobody is really going to think of looking for me here. You can nap or just kind of hang out and just really have some personal time. Hey, hand me that camera. \nRonnie picks up a shitty camera and hands it to Dennis. \nDENNIS Thanks, Ronnie. \nDennis stands up on the bench and looks into the other changing room. The two high school girls are changing into other clothes. Dennis starts taking pictures of them without them knowing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DUMPSTERS - DAY \nRonnie is smoking a joint and so is Dennis. \nDENNIS Right before lunch I usually blaze up again real good. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MALL - DAY \nDennis and Ronnie walk by the skaters. \nDENNIS Hey, what's up, motherfuckers?! \nSTEVIE What up, Big Den?! \nDENNIS You know, smokin' that good good. \nSTEVIE Dude, why are you hanging out with Ronnie? \nRONNIE Fuck you, Stevie! \nDENNIS Hey, Ronnie's alright.   Let me see that stick. \nStevie slides the skateboard over to Dennis. He jumps on it and does a perfectly executed kick flip. The skaters cheer! \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nBrandi is at the counter with Bruce.   She helps a MALE customer. \nBRANDI That'll be $39.99. \nMALE My wife's gonna love this perfume. \nBRANDI I hope so.

RECORD STORE - DAY \nRonnie stands in the store and looks down at his walkie. \nMARK (V.O.) (over the walkie) Ronnie, we need you down at the candy store. Some little brat has been shoveling peanuts in his mouth for the last hour. \nRonnie turns the walkie-talkie off. \nDennis runs behind the counter. Dennis drops the needle on a ROCKIN' SONG. Dennis jumps on top of the counter and starts jumping up and down with the music. He's fucking drunk. Dennis jumps off the counter and tackles Ronnie, knocking over a stand of DVD's. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - DAY \nRonnie and Dennis ride on a mini railroad train for kids. They both drink from the flask as they spin around the track. It's full of nothing but kids and security. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - VICTORIA'S SECRET - DAY \nThe HOT SALES CLERK stands outside of the dressing room wearing a sexy teddy with a G-string and garters. \nDennis and Ronnie are kicking back in the love seat and watching. Dennis makes a motion for the Sales Clerk to spin around. She reluctantly does as she is instructed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALL - TOY STORE - DAY \nRonnie and Dennis play video games.

The tickets pour out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MALL - DAY \nRonnie and Dennis are driving in the golf cart and they're both wearing those GIANT SUNGLASSES that they won with arcade tickets. Behind them, Stevie and the other Skaters hold onto the golf cart and get pulled on their skateboards. \nThey race towards a loading ramp. Dennis floors it and they go up the ramp and JUMP the golf cart into the air. The golf cart and Skaters soar into the air. It holds forever, until suddenly, the golf cart lands with a thud. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. MALL - NIGHT \nThe mall is basically empty as Dennis and Ronnie make the final rounds. They get to the doors and lock up for the night. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Dennis, I got to thank you for today. Man, I was so down, but you taught me that I don't need to take things so seriously here. We have a pointless existence. Who gives a fuck? \nDENNIS Don't mention it, homey. I'm just glad I got me a partner in crime. \nRONNIE A partner. I like that. You know, I've never really had a friend before, but I think that this could be the beginning of a real good thing. \nDennis unlocks the doors to the Gap. \nDENNIS You ain't even seen the best part. After everybody leaves, I rob the shit out of this place. \nRONNIE What do you mean? \nDENNIS I steal shit! \nRONNIE You're the one who's been robbing the mall? \nDENNIS Hell yeah!   Who'd you think it was?! \nDennis goes inside the Gap and just starts grabbing shit. \nRONNIE I can't believe this. Right in front of my goddamn face this whole time! \n", "test2_id": 1060, "test3_input": "Dennis holds up a sweat shirt. \nDENNIS This probably will look good with my complexion. \nRONNIE Dennis, I can't take part in this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDENNIS Ronnie, I thought you were down?! What the fuck?! Here I am opening up myself to you and you're just gonna stick it to me like this. What the fuck has this place ever done for you? Don't you know that people see us as jokes?! A useless tool that's left in the shed. Well that's not me. Not now, not ever. I told you, I'm an outlaw. \nRONNIE I can't let you rob the mall. \nDENNIS What the fuck you mean you can't let me? \nRONNIE Come on, Dennis. We're best friends, so just put that stuff back and let's go get a beer. \nDENNIS Alright, Ronnie, you're right. \nDennis sets the shirts down. \nDENNIS I don't really know what I was thinking. Robbing the mall? Let's just go get that beer. \nRONNIE Good, man.   That makes me feel better. \nRonnie turns to walk, but Dennis grabs the hand of one of the mannequins and rips it off. He takes the hand and cracks Ronnie over the head with it. Ronnie goes down on his knees. \nDENNIS See ya in Mexico, bitch. \nDennis cocks back and whacks Ronnie again.      Ronnie's lights go out. \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nDennis pulls out of the mall driving a HARLEY DAVIDSON. He flips a joint into the air and peels out. He cruises down the street. He passes a cop car and flips it off. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING \nThe JANITOR walks up the floor with a mop. Ronnie is battered and bloodied from his fight with Dennis, but he is wide awake and handcuffed to THE GAP. \nRONNIE Ramon, get your ass over here!

MALL - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY \nMark sits across the desk from Ronnie and Charles. \nMARK How fucking stupid do you have to be?! I mean Dennis. What the fuck, Ronnie? How could you not have known it was Dennis? Then, how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get away. OBSERVE AND REPORT. Those are the only two things you have to do and you can't do those worth a shit. \nRONNIE Can I speak now? \nMARK Go ahead. \nRONNIE Are you sure? \nMARK Just start talking, Ronnie! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE It seems only natural that 'some people' would want to blame me and truth be told I do put a lot of that blame on myself. But some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them. Some people might say that the reason this happened was the undeniable fact that I was under- equipped and quite frankly, lacking a sufficient firearm. But not me. I carry this loss alone deep inside my heart. \nMARK Good.   Because you're fired. \nRONNIE (PLAYFUL) Fuck you. \nMARK I'm serious, Ronnie. I've always liked you, but there's just no excuse for this. Somebody is going down and I'll be damned if it's going to be me. Now, don't make a big thing out of this. Just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day. \nRONNIE Wait a minute. I thought I could trust you, Mark, and now you're telling me that you're going to be the one to put the knife in my back. Fair weather friend you are. \nMARK I'm not your friend, I'm your boss. \nRONNIE You think you're so smart, Mark. You don't know everything. If you're firing me, then you can say goodbye to your entire Security staff. Because there is no fucking way my team is going to work here if you fire me. Isn't that right, Charles? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHARLES Ronnie, I got to talk to you about this. Mark asked me down here to escort you out. \nRONNIE And you told him to fuck off, right? Charles? Right? \nCHARLES What the fuck do you want from me, Ronnie? \n", "test3_true": "Charles stands up. \nCHARLES I'm sorry, Ronnie, but it's time to go. \nRONNIE Wait a minute.     I'll work for free, Mark. \nMARK No, Ronnie. \nRONNIE I'll pay you. \nMARK Nope. \nRONNIE I love you. \nMARK Ronnie, Jesus have a little self- respect. \nRONNIE You don't love me, Mark? \nMARK Ronnie, it's over. \nRonnie takes a deep breath. He stands up to leave. Ronnie starts to walk out, but stops. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE Hey, Charles. Mark asked you down here in case I got out of hand? Well, get ready to earn your money. \nRonnie cracks. He grabs a calendar and throws it on the ground in a violent baby-like outburst. \nMARK Stop him! \nCharles tries to grab Ronnie, but Ronnie pushes him off. Ronnie knocks the framed pictures off of the wall. He then opens the door and slams it into the wall over and over again. That does nothing. Ronnie tries to rip the cushion on the chair. He looks ridiculous. \nCHARLES Alright, Ronnie, that's enough. \nRonnie stops and begins to cry.     Then he runs out of the office in tears. \nINT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - DAY/NIGHT \nRonnie lies in his bed and we... \nTIME LAPSE: The sun rises and sets three times through the window of his bedroom, signifying that three days have passed. The whole time, Ronnie doesn't move from his bed. \nUntil... \nRonnie gets on his \"nice\" clothes, but they're a far cry from his Security Guard uniform. Ronnie's Mom comes up to him. \nMOM What's on the agenda for today? \nRONNIE I guess maybe look for a job or something. \nMOM Well, I know you're sad about it, but try to look on the bright side. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRONNIE There is no bright side.   My life is over. \nMOM Ronnie, you may not be smart or handsome, but you've got dreams inside of you and dreams make you special. No matter what this world tries to throw at you, they can never take those dreams away. \nRONNIE What the fuck are you talking about, Mom? \nMOM I don't know. I'm drunk. I just know that mothers are supposed to talk like that to their children when they're sad, so I tried. What do you want from me? \nRONNIE Nothing. That's exactly what you're supposed to do. I just blew my life. I tried to be a big shot, a hero and a stupid cop. I wanted to be recognized for being great. I should have just been happy where I was at. I didn't do my duty. \nMOM Ronnie, the other night when I soiled my pants right before I puked myself, I was thinking about how you would come home and find me and clean me up. I knew you would be there to find me and take care of me, so I was able to pass out on the floor and not worry. If there's one thing you know about, it's duty. \nRONNIE I do it because I love you. \nMOM I know and I love you too,   Ronnie. I haven't always been easy   to deal with and most people would   have thrown me away a long time   ago. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMOM (CONT'D) Just like your father did. But not you, Ronnie. Look, whiskey was always the way I dealt with being a single mother, but as I get older, I know that I can't keep doing this. I've got everything I need with you. So I want you to know that I'm ready to make a change. Your life needs to get easier and you don't need to take care of old Mom anymore. \nRONNIE Are you going to quit drinking? \nMOM I'm switching to beer. I can pound those all day and still keep my shit together. I'm doing it for you. \nRONNIE I'm so proud of you, Mom. \nMOM I'm proud of you. Now today is a new day and we're going to get through it. Now, get out there and find what the world has in store for you. \nRonnie's Mom leaves and Ronnie looks at himself in the mirror. Then something catches his eye. Ronnie sees a newspaper laying on the ground. He picks it up and reads. \n", "test3_id": 1061}

CAMERA TRUCKS with them as they weave in and out of crowd. Miss Wilson points out celebrated guests to her. 
MISS WILSON 
There's the Spanish Ambassador. 
Gallagher steals a glance at the celebrated gentleman. 
GALLAGHER 
You know, he looks like one. 
Miss Wilson laughs delightedly. At this point they are interrupted by a butler. 
149. MEDIUM SHOT 
BUTLER 
Miss Wilson 
MISS WILSON 
Yes? 
BUTLER 
Mrs. Smith would like to see you. 
MISS WILSON 
(to Gallagher) 
Will you excuse me? Make yourself at home for just a moment, please. 
GALLAGHER 
Thanks. 
Miss Wilson follows butler out of scene. Gallagher is left alone. She wanders about the huge ballroom, peering here and there, searching for Stew. Finally she comes to a large open French door and steps out. 
150. INT. TERRACE LEADING OFF SCHUYLER BALLROOM 
Several groups of men and women are seated at tables. Gallagher enters from ballroom, glances quickly at all the men. Disappointed at not finding Stew, she crosses terrace and descends broad stone steps and advances into garden. 
151. INT. SECLUDED SPOT IN GARDEN 
Stew, his head cupped in his hands, is seated on a stone bench. Gallagher wanders into scene. She sees Stew and stops. Stew does not move. Gallagher, with a happy smile on her lips, moves closer to him. Stew suddenly becomes conscious of someone near him and looks suddenly up. He sees Gallagher; his face breaks into a happy grin. 
GALLAGHER 
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph. 
STEW 
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you. 
GALLAGHER 
There you are! 
152. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO 
STEW 
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto? 
GALLAGHER 
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw. 
STEW 
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here. 
GALLAGHER 
Well, I'll have to look someplace else. 
STEW 
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck. 
GALLAGHER 
(fixing his tie) 
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten. 
He suddenly realizes there's something different about Gallagher. He takes a step back so as to look her over carefully - blinks his eyes. 
STEW 
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself? 
GALLAGHER 
Nothing. 
STEW 
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress? 
GALLAGHER 
I dyed one and washed the other. 
STEW 
(enthusiastically) 
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good. 
153. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN 
Anne is walking in direction of Stew and Gallagher. She stops suddenly when she sees them. Her body stiffens. 
CUT BACK TO: 
ANOTHER SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER 
From Anne's angle. Gallagher is facing in the direction of Anne. 
GALLAGHER 
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us. 
STEW 
Staring at us? 
GALLAGHER 
My mistake - she's glaring. 
STEW 
Must be my wife. 
He turns - sees Anne. 
STEW 
It is my wife. Hi Anne. Don't go away. Stay right there, because I'm going to bring a friend up I want you to meet. 
They exit. 
154. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE 
Standing as before. She is looking off with slightly narrowed eyes. Stew and Gallagher come up to her. 
STEW 
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher. 
ANNE 
(astounded)

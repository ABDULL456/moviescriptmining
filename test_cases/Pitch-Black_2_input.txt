He's found a crevice in the canyon wall. 
RIDDICK Inside...inside.... 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them. 
EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over to the crevice... 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
...and slide it over the opening. A black beat. 
AUDREY (a beat) Why's he still out there? 
Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them? 
EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise. He stops at the top, peers through the rain. 
RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement. 
Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow, slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail. 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
AUDREY He's not coming back, is he? 
Fry checks Imam's face. Did Riddick say anything to you?" Imam wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see his face. 
FRY There's light in here. 
It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few. 
FRY What are they? 
CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life. 
IMAM Larva.... 
AUDREY Glow worms.... 
FRY (mind racing) How many bottles we got? Empty ones? 
INT. SKIFF - NIGHT 
Riddick boards the dark craft. 
Connects the power cells to the battery bay. 
Watches the ship come to life. 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms. 
AUDREY More, more, we need more.... 
They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their world. 
EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT 
Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff, looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision? Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately... 
Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and closes the hatch behind him. 
EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she spies... 
The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light. 
EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The chrome pump is open and filled with money.  Baby Joker's pulling out the money while Joker sits on the bed counting it.  They stop when they hear CHEECO BARKING. 
BABY JOKER Want me to take a look? 
JOKER No, keep working. 
In the mirror behind Joker, we see a stick slide through the curtain.  The curtain cracks just enough to see Craig's eye looking in. 
Just then, Li'l Joker bursts through the door with his shirt off and two half-naked girls on his arms. 
LI'L JOKER Yo, man fuck that shit.  Do it later. It's Friday, time to party, SA. 
JOKER Close the door. 
LI'L JOKER Not until you come party with us, man. 
Baby Joker looks at the girls, then at Joker. 
JOKER Alright, put it in that drawer. 
Joker hands Baby Joker the money.  He puts it away.  They start to exit the room.

Craig is still looking.  Day-Day is scared shitless.  He's looking for Cheeco. 
DAY-DAY (whispering) What you see? 
CRAIG That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it. 
DAY-DAY Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it. 
CRAIG No, man, just wait. 
Craig climbs in the window.  Day-Day holds his stomach. 
DAY-DAY I got the B-G's. 
ROACH 
... his meat supply is almost gone.  He tries to think fast. Cheeco starts to look for more meat.  Roach grabs the smashed brownie out of his pocket and throws it to Cheeco.  He swallows it in one big gulp.  He's looking for more.  There is no more.  Roach smiles.  CHEECO GROWLS. 
ROACH Good boy.  Nice dog. 
CHEECO'S STILL GROWLING.  Suddenly Cheeco falls back on his butt and lets out a slight moan. 
CHEECO'S POV 
Cheeco is looking up at Roach.  He's seeing double, even triple.  Cheeco lays down.  It looks like he's faded. 
ROACH No lungs, baby.  No lungs. 
INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Craig is in.  The bedroom door is cracked.  Craig walks over and shuts the door gently.  He locks it.  Then he creeps over to the dresser.  He pulls out the pump and sets it on the bed.  He opens it, revealing all the bundled-up money packed in.  He starts to stuff it in his pockets.

Day-Day is trying to keep his composure. 
INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS 
The SA brothers are having a good time.  Joker is getting nasty with one of the Girls.  He pulls her by the hand. 
GIRL #2 No. 
JOKER Fuck that.

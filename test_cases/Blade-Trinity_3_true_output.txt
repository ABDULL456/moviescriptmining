FROM THE WATER, 
a military Zodiac (inflatable boat) roars up one of the wooden boat ramps, laden with gun-toting AGENTS.  They jump out, fanning all over the boat house. 
He hears a 
AGENT On the floor!  ON THE FLOOR! 
Whistler FIRES at them, then makes a run for it.  The agents RETURN FIRE, but Whistler ducks behind a concrete pillar -- 
EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
Cop cruisers, unmarked cars, and SWAT trucks sweep in, SIRENS blaring, disgorging a small army of POLICE and FBI AGENTS. POLICE BOATS are pulling up to the dock. 
AGENTS CUMBERLAND AND HALE 
emerge from an unmarked, wearing bullet-proof vests, brandishing firearms.  Cumberland barks orders into a radio. 
CUMBERLAND Lock it down!  Keep them contained! 
On the rooftops above, various SWAT SNIPERS take position. 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
Blade BRAWLS with a half-dozen agents, sending them flying in all directions.  He grabs one agent, HEAD-BUTTS him, THROWS him into the path of two others -- 
Then he reaches for another, THROWING him THROUGH a window at the rear, out into the river which runs below -- 
ON WHISTLER 
as he moves with increased urgency.  The armory is filling up with tear gas.  Coughing and half-blind, he hurries to a bank of computers, types in a series of commands -- 
THE VARIOUS COMPUTER MONITORS 
around him synch up, showing the same protocol message: 
Data protection routine enabled 
--	Server 1 protection enabled... 
--	Server 2 protection enabled... 
In response, a rack of network storage equipment and removable hard drives EXPLODES.  Then a second rack of equipment EXPLODES as well. 
EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
From their vantage point below, Cumberland and the others can hear the explosions. Cumberland is on his radio, SHOUTING: 
CUMBERLAN D What's going on in there? 
AGENT'S VOICE (over radio) Some kind of self-destruct program! They're fragging their hard drives! 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
Whistler keeps moving.  An agent gets a clear shot at him, FIRES -- Whistler is hit in the chest. 
Blade SEES Whistler take the hit, but he's cut off from the old man, being swarmed by agents -- 
BLADE WHISTLER! 
Whistler staggers, keeps moving.  He makes it to another bank of computers, launches the same protocol. 
ON MORE MONITORS 
Erasing information, purging themselves.  We see commands: 
--	Workstation 1 protection enabled 
--	Workstation 2 protection enabled 
With each successive command, the workstations themselves begin self-destructing, EXPLODING one after another. 
Another agent gets a bead on Whistler, FIRING a round into Whistler's thigh.  Whistler SCREAMS -- 
ON BLADE, 
in anguish as he sees his mentor being slaughtered.  Then two agents are RUSHING HIM, tackling Blade.  As one they fall backwards, into another bank of windows --

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again. 
JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth. 
ANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something... QUI-GON : What? ANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you? QUI-GON : What makes you think that? ANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon. 
QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles. 
QUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him. ANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight. QUI-GON : I wish that were so... ANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves...have you come to free us? QUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not... ANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here? 
QUI-GON thinks for a moment. 
QUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept secret. ANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim? PADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it. ANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything! QUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we need... JAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade. PADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind. SHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races. QUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used properly. ANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished... SHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you... ANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you. 
QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset. 
SHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it. 
ANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina pitty bad goo. GUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might be able to help us? 
SHMI shakes her head no. 
ANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other... SHMI : Anakin, don't... 
JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat. 
PADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will find another way... SHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but he can help you...he was meant to help you. ANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes! 
The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel. 
EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY 
The storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up the mess and rebuild their food stalls. JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing next to him. PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop. 
PADME : Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know. The Queen will not approve. QUI-GON : The Queen does not need to know. PADME : Well, I don't approve. 
QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop. 
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY 
WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese. 
WATTO : Patta go bolla! ANKAIN : No batta! WATTO : Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya. ANAKIN : Bayno, Bayno! 
QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him. 
WATTO : The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can't afford parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs) QUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee. 
QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of WATTO. He studies it. 
WATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian. QUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need. WATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it. 
ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward. 
ANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly. WATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there. QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever built." WATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think. QUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.

GEORGE (CONT'D) Please don't do that. 
IRA (tears streaming down his 
FACE) I won't do it, I promise, man. Ira wipes the tears from his face. New tears immediately come out. 
IRA (CONT'D) That was first and last time. I'm not even crying anymore. 
GEORGE 
(CRYING) You're still crying. 
IRA (tears coming down) I don't think I am. I think I'm not anymore. I'm not sure what you're talking about. 
GEORGE Okay, as long as we got that straight. George takes a napkin and puts it over his face. 
IRA I'm sorry, George. I really don't know what to do, I don't know how to help you. 
GEORGE (his face still in the 
NAPKIN) No, you're right. I really should tell some people. It just sucks, man. It just sucks. And they're going to feel so bad, I don't even want to look at them and tell them. 
(MORE) 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'd rather drop dead. of a heart attack and have someone else make the calls. I have to make those calls? This is a nightmare. This is a total nightmare. 
IRA Do you want me to call them, and tell them what's going on? 
GEORGE Yeah. 
IRA Fuck. I was hoping you were gonna say no. 
INT. IRA'S BEDROOM 
Ira is on the phone. There is a paper with a bunch of numbers in front of him. 
IRA (into the phone) Hi, this is Ira, I'm a friend of George's. He asked me to call you. His roommates are making a commotion outside. Ira covers the receiver. 
IRA (CONT'D) Will you guys shut the fuck up? Shut the fuck up! Ira slam the door. 
IRA (CONT'D) (into phone) I'm sorry. I have some news about George. 
TELLING FRIENDS SEQUENCE 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
George sits with THREE COMEDIANS. They are all laughing and telling old sex stories from george's younger days. Ira sits with them and listens and laughs along. 
GEORGE So I left the phone off the hook so he could hear me doing it. 
COMEDIAN #1 That's very gay. 
COMEDIAN#2 No, it was a buddy thing. It was very heterosexual. 
GEORGE Admit it, you were masturbating. 
COMEDIAN#2 Of course I was whacking it. What else am I gonna do, not whack it? 
GEORGE And I kept making her talk and say crazy shit just to make him laugh. 
COMEDIAN #2 I think at one point you said, "Say my hog is the biggest you've ever seen." And then there is this long pause. 
COMEDIAN#3 That's a bad sign. If it was big at all she wouldn't have paused. 
COMEDIAN #1 Remember you used to have that joke about how you used to only date midgets because your dick looked bigger in their little hands. They all laugh. 
COMEDIAN #2 Yeah, you used to get all the girls, man. Suddenly the air is out of the room, and it is awkward and sad. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
George is talking to an EX-MANAGER and his WIFE. 
EX-MANAGER And I feel horrible about it, but the truth is, I was having some issues with gambling, and you were doing so well-and so I took a million dollar check you got in from the studio and I used it to clear up some debts. And I did it with the intention of paying you right back before you noticed. But you never noticed, and I just never got around to paying you back. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Allen Covert yells at George for abandoning him.

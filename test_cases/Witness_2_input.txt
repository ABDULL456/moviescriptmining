Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened storefronts. 
Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST EVERY FEW MINUTES. 
CARTER I got there late, John. 
BOOK Let's just find Coalmine. (beat) Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
CARTER (grimly) It won't happen again. 
RACHEL Where are you taking us? 
BOOK We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area. 
RACHEL You have no right to keep us here. 
BOOK Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide. 
RACHEL You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws! 
BOOK Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that. 
RACHEL It's not a joke. 
Book decides to try contrition: 
BOOK You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, I know a little about the Amish. I know this has to be an ordeal for you; and I'm really sorry you an Samuel got involved. 
Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book frowns. 
BOOK What was that? 
RACHEL He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you. 
Book eyes Samuel: 
BOOK Book. John Book 
EXT. 13TH ST. STATION  NIGHT 
Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's side window. 
INT. BOOK'S CAR  NIGHT 
Book lowers the window. 
BOOK Sammy, where's Coalmine? 
The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the back seat. 
SAMMY What you got there, the Salvation Army? 
BOOK Coalmine. 
SAMMY Try "Happy Valley". 
EXT. HAPPY VALLEY BAR, SOUTH STREET  NIGHT 
Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get out, and move swiftly inside. 
INT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT 
Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their move... 
EXT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT 
As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see Coalmine is not the killer. 
As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car. An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's face down next to the car window. 
BOOK Put some light on him. 
A cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over Coalmine's face. 
BOOK (continuing; to Samuel) Look at him. 
Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at Samuel inside the car: 
Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative. 
Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing his face up against the front window. His face takes on a grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he gets back in the car. 
RACHEL John Book, you listen to me! I will have no further part in this, nor will my son! As God stands between us! 
Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off. 
EXT. HOTEL  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT 
Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN moves to open the rear door.

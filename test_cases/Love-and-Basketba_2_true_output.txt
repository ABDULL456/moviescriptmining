SIDRA Girl, don't you know you're just sloppy seconds? 
Monica rises. 
MONICA What? 
Toni tries to step in. 
TONI Sidra, let it go. 
SIDRA Only reason you're here is cause Tonya Randall got pregnant and decided not to come.  They were done recruiting. 
KELLI, senior forward, shakes her head. 
KELLI That's cold, Sid. 
SIDRA Just thought the girl should know. 
Monica is stunned.  Sidra saunters to the showers.  Shayla nudges her with her shoulder. 
SHAYLA Don't even trip.  She's just mad cause she's bow-legged. 
INT. USC SUITES - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Monica and Quincy lay feet to face on Quincy's twin bed. 
Monica's hand holds an ice bag on Quincy's hip.  Quincy's arm rests across an ice bag on Monica's ankle. 
QUINCY Forget Tonya Randall. 
MONICA I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me. 
QUINCY Then prove her wrong. 
MONICA I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me. 
QUINCY So you're gonna act salty all night? 
Quincy's roommate/teammate REGGIE, 18, suddenly pops his head into the room. 
REGGIE Yo, dog, we're about to order some wings. 
QUINCY Nah, thanks. 
Reggie shrugs, closes the door.  Quincy looks at Monica, still brooding. 
QUINCY (cont'd) Fine.  Don't worry about proving everybody wrong, okay?  You can't handle the pressure, I'll understand. 
MONICA That was so weak. 
QUINCY Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway. 
Monica shoves Quincy's ice bag down his sweat pants.  He leaps up. 
QUINCY (cont'd) Aaaah!  Damn, girl! 
MONICA That's what you get. 
He smiles as he pulls the ice.  Then looks her up and down. 
QUINCY So how about a little one-on-one? 
MONICA What are we playing for? 
QUINCY Clothes. 
MONICA What? 
Quincy locks the door, sets up his indoor hoop. 
QUINCY I score, you strip.  You score, I drop something. 
Monica looks at him, then cracks up. 
MONICA Give me the ball. 
QUINCY My court, I go first. 
Quincy grips the ball.  Monica crouches low on defense. Quincy drives past her and slams down a vicious dunk. 
QUINCY (cont'd) Strip. 
Monica makes a face, then pulls off her sweatshirt.  Quincy skips back.  Monica drops low again.  Quincy fakes her out and slams down another vicious dunk.  He laughs. 
QUINCY (cont'd) Where's the "D"? 
MONICA Kiss my booty. 
QUINCY Plan to. 
Monica glares through her smile, then pulls off her T-shirt, leaving her in a bra and shorts. 
Quincy goes for another dunk, but this time, Monica reaches out, GRABS HIS DICK.  Quincy drops the ball.  Monica picks it up and lays it in.

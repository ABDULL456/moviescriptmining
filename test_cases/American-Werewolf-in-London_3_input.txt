DERELICT #3 So what?  Let `im choke. 
JACK Do you mind?  The man's a friend of mine. 
DERELICT #3 Well he ain't no friend of mine. 
BRINGSLY Gentlemen, please. 
HARRY A gun. 
DERELICT #1 I know where he can get a gun. 
DAVID Don't I need a silver bullet or something? 
JACK Be serious, would you? 
David puts his head in his hands. 
DAVID Madness.  I've gone totally mad. 
HARRY A gun is good. 
JUDITH You just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger. 
BRINGSLY If you put it in your mouth, then you'd be sure not to miss. 
DAVID Thank you, you're all so thoughtful. 
As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head suddenly. 
CUT TO: 
83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT 
The clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up. 
84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle staring at him. 
DAVID (gasps out in anguish) Go away!  Please!  Go away! 
The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow more severe. 
DAVID (his face contorting) Run!  Please...run. 
His hands clutch the arms of his chair.  Coarse thick hair splits his skin.  The children's eyes widen in fascination. 
85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
Roars and screams come from inside the theater.  The TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady: TICKET TAKER I'll check on the house. 
He goes inside the theater. 
86   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
The Ticket Taker enters the theater.  The movie continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror. 
THE WOLF SPRINGS! 
CUT TO: 
87   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT 
From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and single out TWO BOBBIES running furiously to the cinema through the busy traffic. 
88   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical.

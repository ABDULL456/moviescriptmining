CASPER I don't know. Your just sitting there. And your tits look clean to me. It makes me  want to suck on 'em. 
Telly is sitting in the same spot, talking to Darcy. 
DARCY I thought you had a girlfriend. 
TELLY Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you? 
DARCY No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends. 
TELLY She won't? Why not? 
DARCY I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me. 
TELLY Yeah. I can understand that. 
Back to the shallow end with Casper, Steven, Harold, Kim, and Joy. 
HAROLD I truth or dare you guys to kiss each other. 
JOY Sure. We kiss all the time. 
They both smile at each other and kiss softly on the lips. As they part, they smile. 
CASPER You guys are dykes right? 
KIM No. 
JOY No. 
STEVEN Then how can you kiss each other like that? 
Harold makes a strange face. 
HAROLD Yeah. How can you do that shit? 
KIM It doesn't matter. It just feels good. That's all. 
JOY Yeah. It's not like we're gay. It's just kissing another person, a friend. 
Joy grabs Kim's hand. 
KIM Yeah. 
JOY It's no big deal. 
CASPER I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice. 
HAROLD Yeah. Do it again. 
Telly and Darcy. 
TELLY You should come back with me to Steven's house. 
DARCY Tonight? 
TELLY Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out. 
DARCY I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight. 
TELLY Come on. You can rave on another night. 
She looks at him. 
TELLY Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug  out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise. 
DARCY Yeah?

{"test1_input": "\"FOUR ROOMS\" \nScreenplay by \nAllison Anders \nAlexandre Rockwell \nRobert Rodriguez \nQuentin Tarantino \nMAIN TITLES \nAs presentation credits begin, we hear Johnny Cash's \"Home of the Blues.\" Then we see Allison's name, under it Alex's, under that Robert's, under that Quentin's, then under that the title logo for Four Rooms, followed by \"Starring Tim Roth as the Bellboy.\" Then \"The Guests\" listed in alphabetical order of all the actors playing guests. After the actors' names, we... \nFADE UP ON A WALL \nThe camera pans down a weathered wall covered with postcards from Miami Beach, Florida, the Copacabana, N.Y.C., \"Wish You Were Here\" from Niagara Falls, rickshaws and babes on beaches, etc.... \nThe camera comes to rest on an old photograph of a 1930s hotel, the \"Mon Signor,\" in its heyday, with a full staff of 30 people posed on the lawn in front. \nAn old guy with a staccato voice delivers a monologue: \nVOICE-OVER There used to be a staff of fifty in this place. I'm the only one left from those days. It all comes down to one sap: the night-shift bellhop, that's me. What the hell is a bellhop? You know where the name comes from? (silence) Of course not... It's so simple it's stupid. They ring a bell and you hop. You hop to front and center. No heroes in this line, kid. Just men doing a job. No questions asked, none answered. I try to keep it simple, kid, not too personal... \nAnother voice of a young man interrupts. \nTED You met any of those old stars? \nTHE OLD GUY Stars! Are you kidding me? I took Rin Tin Tin out for a shit, for Christ's sakes. I taught Shirley Temple how to roller-skate. I saw Fatty Arbuckle regurgitate three cheese sandwiches right on the spot you're sitting, kid. What did you say your name was? \nTED Ted. \nTHE OLD GUY Ted, right. I remember Marilyn used to come down at night and doze off in the kitchen. She liked the sound of the fans out back spinning around. Sure, these were stars, kid. Errol Flynn used to call me \"Alibi.\" You'll pick up a few stories yourself, kid. \nTED I don't think so, not like yours. \nTHE OLD GUY What do you think a star does when he goes to the bathroom, kid? \nTED Beats me. \nTHE OLD GUY He pulls his pants down and takes a crap just like you and me. Take my word for it. \nA wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with a lip print on it signed \"Marilyn.\" The camera pulls back to reveal Ted and the Old Guy sitting on a foldout cot in a small back room of the Hotel Mon Signor. The old man is dressed in a striped T-shirt with a bellhop's cap on. He looks like an old pirate. Next to him on the bed sits Ted, a young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees. The old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar. \nTHE OLD GUY Camacho! \nTED Who? \nTHE OLD GUY The cigar. Cuban. A good cigar, wrapped in Miami. I get a box of them every Christmas from the chairman of the board. I think he sends them to me to keep my mouth shut. It's tough not to get a little personal in this business. \nThe old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares down at his cap, lost in thought. \nTED What do you mean? \nThe old guy passes the cap over to Ted. \nTHE OLD GUY Put it on. \nTed puts the cap on. \nTHE OLD GUY Frankly, you look stupid... like the Philip Morris guy. I can't believe I wore that thing for fifty years. You keep it. \nThe Old Guy gets up from the bed and throws a jacket on. Pulls a few postcards off the wall, throws them in an old straw suitcase, and slams the lid down. He heads for the door. Ted follows. \nTHE OLD GUY Stay away from night clerks, kids, hookers, and marital disputes. \nThe Old Guy pauses for a second and looks Ted dead in the eye. \nTHE OLD GUY Never have sex with the clientele. \nTED No way, not me. You got any other advice. \nTHE OLD GUY Always get a tip. \nThe door slams shut on the back room. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY--TWILIGHT \nThe big empty lobby of the Mon Signor. You can tell that at one point this used to be a swank place. It still is, kinda. It's also kinda decrepit. The concierge -- a snappy, fast- talking, red-haired young woman in a blue blazer named Betty -- stands behind the reception desk. The old man, suitcase in hand, makes a beeline through the lobby, heading toward the front door. Betty sees him. \n", "test1_true": "The Old Guy stops in his tracks and turns around. \nTHE OLD GUY What? \nBetty comes from behind the desk. \nBETTY I just want to say good-bye. \nTHE OLD GUY Who are you? \nBETTY Uhhh, Betty. The concierge. Your boss. \nThe Old Guy squints his eyes at the young gal. \nTHE OLD GUY Oh yeah. Gotta light, sister? Goddam cigar went out. \nBETTY Yeah, sure. \nShe speaks to the Old Guy as she lights his cigar and he puffs away. \nBETTY I just want you to know, from the owner and all the staff, your fifty years of service have been an inspiration to us all. You're a legend in your own time, and the Mon Signor will never be the -- \nTHE OLD GUY Just forward my cigars, Red. (He turns around the walks out, saying over his shoulder) Aufwiedersehen! \nBetty is left standing in the lobby. Ted appears behind her in his bellbody uniform, sans cap. \nTED Sam the bellboy. Now there was a man. \nBETTY Yeah. Oh, hi, Teddy. Ready to start the night shift? \nTED Yeah. \nBETTY Well, let me buy you a drink. \nTED You wanna buy me a drink? I'm starting my shift. \nBETTY You're not an alcoholic, are you; one drink won't kill you. \nTED Yeah, sure. \nThey walk out of frame. In the empty frame we \nSUPER: NEW YEAR'S EVE 7:00 P.M. \nINT. BACK ROOM--NIGHT \nBetty and Ted sit in the back room, both with drinks in their hand. This dialogue is to be delivered rapid fire, Howard Hawks style. \nBETTY After fifty years, Sam retires, and you're taking over the night shift. \nTED Correct. \nBETTY You're filling some mighty big shoes. \nTED Oh, I know. \nBETTY Sam was a legend in the hotel business. \nTED Oh, I know... \nBETTY A bellhop's bellhop. \nTED An inspiration to us all. \nBETTY He ran the night desk for fifty years, all by himself. \nTED An amazing man. \nBETTY No desk clerk. No night man. No help. Just fuckin' Sam, and his wits. \nTED A man alone. \nBETTY And you're gonna do the same. \nTED I know. \nBETTY Tonight. \nTed spews his drink. \nTED Tonight! \n", "test1_id": 3213, "test2_input": "TED What the hell you got in here, lady? Nuclear weapons? \nShe relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the bag. \nATHENA (dryly) The White Cliffs of Dover. \nTed is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. She hands it to him. Ted is grateful and disoriented. \nATHENA The others will be coming soon. Send them, pleeze. \nTed nods, confused by \"the others,\" and walks off with the cart. Then he turns from outside the doorway. \nTED Oh -- I forgot to show you how to turn on the Jacuzzi. \nBut Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and water begins to flow from the baby cupids' urns into the hot tub. \nATHENA I been in dis' place many New Year's. So... you send the others to me, huh. Go now. \nAs she says this, the door closes with a strange force, shutting Ted out. Athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the suite. \nIN THE SUITE BEDROOM \nA round bed with pink tuck'n'roll headboard. It's impossible to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it were achieved by laughing. \nAthena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of stone from her tapestry bag. She caresses it and carries it like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows. \nThen she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching high-heeled slippers. \nAnd these she places with reverence on the bed. \nATHENA On this night, oh great goddess Diana, we restore your virgin flesh and bring you back to real life. \nCLOSE ON the rock slab. We hold the artifact. \nATHENA Soon -- I take you to the pond for a cleansing. Well, it's a swimming pool, but it will be under the setting sun, okay? \nINT. FRONT DESK--DUSK FALLS \nJust as Ted is recovering from the mystery of this first guest, Elspeth arrives. \nShe has skin like marble, the body of Venus, piercing blue eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like Honey West in a rubber dress. She carries several bags, and a silver sword on her shoulder. \nTED May I help you? \nELSPETH I... we... have a reservation. \nThen she snaps, irritated, behind her. \nELSPETH Kiva! \nANGLE ON a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a long leather coat, wearing a tight T-shirt with studs spelling \"PUSSY\" across her breasts. This is Kiva. \nKiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette machine. Just as Ted's eyes grow wide with anxiety, several packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent's hands. \nKIVA Wait up, gawd! I had to get supplies for this boring ass night. \nELSPETH (to Ted) We have a reservation in the Honeymoon Suite. \nTED Oh yeah... you must be one of \"the others.\" And what're you carrying -- the Rock of Gibraltar? \nShe stares at him without humor. He fumbles for the key. He walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile luggage. Jars clang inside. He is ready to go, but Elspeth turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking, as Kiva lights up. \nELSPETH What'd I tell you about smoking? \nKIVA You smoke. \nELSPETH That's right -- I smoke, and I'm addicted to it, and I don't want the same thing to happen to you. \nKIVA (in game-show host voice) \"Hello -- welcome to this week's edition of the Hypocrite of the Year Award --\" \nAs Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host, Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with an unruly child. Ted waits, luggage in hand. \nELSPETH Kiva! That's enough -- \nShe cuts Kiva's ramble off. Kiva blows smoke defiantly. \nKIVA You're not my mother! \nELSPETH Yes I am. \nKIVA Then why're we sleeping together? \n", "test2_true": "Elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self-conscious at his scrutiny. \nELSPETH Well... I didn't mean it... literally. I... I happen to be the only one who... cares about you -- \nBut her wild child looks off, bored. Elspeth turns to Ted, flustered. \nELSPETH Please -- take us to our room! \nTed smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword, but Elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots him a piercing glare. He jumps back with a light nervous laugh. He leads the way to the elevator. \nAT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR \nThe couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee tables, lamps, and the TV. Elspeth and Kiva enter the room. Athena is gone. As Ted stumbles around the furniture in the hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. With most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace. \nBut oddest of all is the pink-tinged water swirling in the Jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. A sprinkle of white powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. Elspeth hands him a tip as he gawks at the circle. \nELSPETH Flea powder. One of the others is bringing her cat. \nTed starts away again, perplexed. He turns for one last look to see Elspeth kneeling before Kiva, who sprawls on the floor. He shakes his head and leaves. \nELSPETH You're gonna have to wait in the other room. \nKIVA Why? \nELSPETH Because I said so. \nKIVA I'll watch TV. \nELSPETH You can't watch TV because the noise will interfere with our ritual. \nKiva looks around the room and spies the TV in the hallway. She turns to Elspeth with sarcastic concession. \nKIVA Okay... Mommy. \nElspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom. Elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar, whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts. \nKiva, behind Elspeth's back, exits from the bedroom doorway into the hall and comes back in, lugging the TV into the honeymoon bedroom. \nElspeth kneels before the altar. Athena enters the room with the \"cleansed\" artifact and lays the slab in the center of the altar upon the heart-shaped pillows as Elspeth lays her sword next to the rock. The women look upon the union with tender affection. \nATHENA Soon -- our goddess will come. I will go get her negligee. \nAthena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks! Loud TV suddenly blasts from the bedroom and Kiva the brat is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. Athena takes the negligee off the irrepressible youth. \nATHENA What are you doing! Have you no respect -- who -- who is dis girl? \nELSPETH Kiva. My friend. Kiva, turn off the TV! I can't leave her at home -- she's on probation and I gotta keep an eye on her. \nATHENA Well, Elspeth, your friend cannot stay here during the ritual. She may be one of your kind, but she is not one of us. \nELSPETH She stays!! Or I go -- along with my offering! \nThe women have a stare-down. Then Athena calls out -- \nATHENA TURN OF THE FUCKING TV, MAN! \nKIVA (in a seductive pout) Make me... \nElspeth becomes anxious with jealousy. Athena is exasperated as she firmly demands from Elspeth -- \nATHENA Let's not forget -- I am the High Fucking Priestess. Deal with dis girl! \nElspeth defers to Athena with remembered reverence and respect. She bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom. \nATHENA (eyes lifted to heaven, wearily) Tell me -- did we have these problems in Salem? I don't think so... \nIN THE BEDROOM \nElspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a soft touch. \nELSPETH Kiva... you know what I love about you? \nKiva smirks... yeah, she knows. \nELSPETH Your sweet side. \nKIVA And what do I get if I'm sweet? \nELSPETH You get whatever you want. And you know what else I love about you? \nKIVA (seduced now) What? \n", "test2_id": 3214, "test3_input": "SIGFRIED I'm psychic, Theodore. \nTED Look my name is Ted, actually, and I have no idea what's going on here, but I've obviously come at a bad time. \nSIGFRIED Let's not belabor the fact that you have no sense of timing, Theodore. The fact is you're here. \nSigfried turns to Angela. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) And I couldn't think of a better time for you to introduce me to your beau than on New Year's Eve. \nTED Oh fuck, there's a mistake. You're fucking wrong here. My name is Theodore, yes! My mother named me that and I hate the name. But I'm a fucking bellhop. People call me Ted. I work here. \nSuddenly, with great force, Sigfried slams the butt of his pistol smack into Ted's temple, sending him to the floor. Ted looks up at Sigfried in shock. \nSIGFRIED Look, I'd love to sit here all night with you talking about things like when you broke in your first mitt -- (pause) That was insensitive of me, wasn't it, T H E O D O R E? But let's cut to the chase, okay? \nTED Okay. \nSIGFRIED So apologize! \nA tense silence fills the room. All eyes are on Ted, who can't figure out what the fuck this guy wants. \nTED For what? \nSigfried looks hard with disbelief at Ted, who winces back. \nSIGFRIED You are really beginning to annoy me, Theodore. \nSigfried throws another handful of pills into his mouth. \nTED Look, obviously you two are working something out and if I could help you with your problem I would. \nSIGFRIED What are you saying? Are you saying I got a problem? Are you trying to say I don't give her what she needs? That I'm FUCKING INSENSITIVE!! \nTED Look, is this about another man? Or something? \nTed has struck a raw nerve. Sigfried's mood swings drastically; he bends down next to Ted. \nSIGFRIED Let's get our ABC's right, here, Theodore. Theodore, right? \nTED Ted's better. \nSIGFRIED Ted, okay... Are you saying my wife cheats on me? \nTED I didn't say that... I... \nSIGFRIED Oh, for Christ's sake, Theodore, this is about as intimate a situation as you can get, you, me, and Angela here. It's pretty cozy. To say nothing of how stupid an idea it is to lie to a man with a loaded gun without considering the possible response. I demand an apology! \nThe phone rings. \nSIGFRIED Don't move. I've got to take this. \nSigfried glances at it. Then to Angela. He picks up the phone. \nSIGFRIED (into phone) What? (pause) We ain't got any needles here, kid. Just a big fucking gun. \nHe listens to the other line, says good-bye, and hangs up. \nSIGFRIED (to Ted) Now, where was I? Oh yeah, I remember. \nSigfried kneels next to Ted and assumes a prayer position. \nSIGFRIED I want you to pray for forgiveness, Theodore. \nSigfried, hands clasped together, signals for Ted to do the same. The gun lies at his side. Ted considers a bold move, but thinks better of it. Sigfried's eyes pop open. He cuts a look to Ted, signaling him to assume the pose. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) Now say after me, \"I apologize...\" \nTED I apologize... \nSIGFRIED For what? \nTed looks to Angela for help. She can only stare back with intense, wide-open eyes. \nSIGFRIED For fucking what? \nTED That I said you might have been unfaithful? \nSIGFRIED \"That I said you might have been unfaithful?\" Listen, Theodore, you're in church here... you're kneeling in front of an altar. Truth... truth is all it hears. Say the following, \"I, Theodore, must humbly and sincerely apologize for saying that you fucked another man!\" \nTed repeats what Sigfried has told him. This appears to have a calming effect on Sigfried, who gets up off the floor, turning his face to Angela. \n", "test3_true": "Angela nods. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) Do you accept the fucking apology? \nNaturally, Angela says nothing. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) You always gotta get the last word, don't you? It's one way with you, Angela, isn't it? I give and I give and I get nothing back. \nSigfried turns to Ted. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) She just sits there waiting for me to jump through hoops... \nAngela attempts to speak through the gag. Both men wait with bated breath for a response. Sigfried's had enough. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) Stupid me, for a second I thought you were going to say something... something like, \"I'm sorry.\" HA! \"I'm sorry.\" You're absolutely right, love cakes, I wouldn't want it that way. That's one thing you can say about Angela. She'll never do anything she doesn't want to do. If the feeling ain't there, she just isn't going to do it. There is nothing in this world as fucked as a woman who gives when she doesn't want to. Never let that happen to you, Theodore. It makes you feel very little indeed. \nTed beckons Sigfried. \nTED You mind if I...? \nSIGFRIED Go ahead. Spit it out. \nTED I don't mean to upset you further, sir, but I think she was trying to say yes. \nSIGFRIED Are you condescending to me, Theodore? \nTED Absolutely not, I would never do that. \nSIGFRIED Why don't you just say it? \nTED Say what? \nSIGFRIED That you think I'm an idiot. \nTED I would never say that. \nSIGFRIED You think you're superior to me, don't ya, Theodore? You don't think I notice there is a gag in the woman's mouth. \nTED Of course you do. \nSIGFRIED Naturally \"of course.\" And do you know how I know that? \nTED How, sir? \nSIGFRIED Because I PUT THE GAG IN HER MOUTH! I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about communication, Theodore. It's all in the eyes... (points the gun at Ted) Him? (turns the gun on himself) Or me? Him or me? No one? Okay. Let's drag it out. \nSigfried empties the last of the pills into his mouth, heaving the empty bottle over his shoulder. He takes off, disappearing into the bathroom. \nINT. ROOM \nTed finds himself alone with Angela. They lock eyes. Angela implores Ted to lean forward. Ted sizes up the situation: His chances of making it to the door are slim due to the fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. Ted paces back and forth in front of Angela, who struggles to get his attention. He whips around and they face off in what appears to be a game of charades. Ted finally gets the point and cautiously removes the gag from Angela's mouth. Angela spits an old sock out. \nTED What! \nANGELA We don't have time to play charades here, asshole! Untie me quick. \nTED Listen, lady, I don't know what in the hell is going on here, but I'd appreciate it if you would explain to that nutcase that he's making a big mistake. \nANGELA Look, whether you like it or not, you're in the middle of a situation here you can't just wish your way out of. \nTED But I've never seen you people before, we're complete strangers. \nANGELA Everyone starts out strangers, Ted, it's where we end up that counts. Hurry up. \nTed wrestles with the idea of whether to untie Angela or not. \nTED I don't know if I can do this. It's too hard. \nANGELA Life is hard, Ted. You ever stopped to consider how many times you change your underwear in a lifetime? \nOn nervous impulse, Ted begins the calculations. \nANGELA I don't mean literally, you ignoramus. \nTED What? \nANGELA Forget it, listen to me. There's a gun in my suitcase behind the bed, it's loaded... \nTED I'm not going to shoot anybody. \nANGELA Fine. Get the gun and I'll shoot \"anybody.\" \n", "test3_id": 3215}

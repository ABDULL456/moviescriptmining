{"train": "BETTY Yes, tonight. \nTED I can't. \nBETTY Yes, you can. \nTED No, I can't. I never worked the night shift before. \nBETTY Oh night shift -- smight shift. \nTED We were supposed to work it together. \nBETTY I know, but I can't. \nTED Why not? \nBETTY I'm having a New Year's Eve party. \nTED Since when? \nBETTY Actually, I'm not having it. My roommate is. And there's this guy. German guy. He's gonna be there. And so am I. \nTED I can't run this place by myself. \nBETTY Oh, sure ya can. \nTED No, I can't. \nBETTY Sam ran this place by himself for fifty years. \nTED Yeah, and he had fifty years of fuckin' practice, too. I haven't had a day. \nBETTY Look, Teddy, calm down -- \nTED -- Don't call me Teddy. \nBETTY Ted, the night's cake. It's easy. The day's when it's busy. During the night there's nothing to do. \nTED It's New Year's Eve. \nBETTY Which'll make it less busy than normal. Ever worked on Christmas? Unless you sell turkeys, business is dead. You just got butterflies, that's all. \nTED What I have ain't butterflies. I can't handle this hotel all by myself. \nBetty slows the scene down. \nBETTY Okay, let's calm down a minute. Slow it down, cool it off. Let's just talk. \nTED You can say any goddamn thing you want -- \nBETTY -- Ted? I thought we were calming down? I thought we were cooling off? No hostility. Say good-bye to hostility. We're just talking. \nTED Okay... okay... okay... I'm calm, I'm cool, let's talk. \nBETTY Ted, in a nutshell, all you have to do is hold the fort. It's New Year's Eve. Most of the guests are going out. You'll just be giving them a little nod as they come staggering in at three... four... five... in the morning. Nobody's having any parties, a few get-togethers, but no parties. You got about three people checking in tonight, that's it. The only variable is Chester Rush in the penthouse. \nTED Chester Rush? The guy from The Wacky Detective? \nBETTY Yeah, him and his entourage checked in last night. They're in the penthouse. The only reason I refer to it as a variable is that he's a movie star. Ya never know about movie stars. I'm tellin' ya, Ted, it's cake. \nBetty takes a piece of paper and writes her number down. \nBETTY (continuing) And look, if you have any problems, call me at the party. \nTed thinks about it for a moment. \nTED Okay. \nBETTY Great -- \nTED -- For fifty bucks. \nBETTY Fifty bucks! \nTED You're shirking your duties for this Nazi. For that you pay a price, and the price is fifty bucks. \nBETTY One, Horst is not a Nazi. Two, that's not a fair price. You're taking advantage of the situation. Twenty bucks. Now, twenty bucks is a fair price. \nTED Yeah, but what you're doin' to me ain't fair. And, you are completely and totally taking advantage of me and your position. So fifty bucks is the perfect price. \nBetty begrudgingly digs in her purse. \nTED What the hell you got in here, lady? Nuclear weapons? \nShe relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the bag. \nATHENA (dryly) The White Cliffs of Dover. \nTed is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. She hands it to him. Ted is grateful and disoriented. \nATHENA The others will be coming soon. Send them, pleeze. \nTed nods, confused by \"the others,\" and walks off with the cart. Then he turns from outside the doorway. \nTED Oh -- I forgot to show you how to turn on the Jacuzzi. \nBut Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and water begins to flow from the baby cupids' urns into the hot tub. \nATHENA I been in dis' place many New Year's. So... you send the others to me, huh. Go now. \nAs she says this, the door closes with a strange force, shutting Ted out. Athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the suite. \nIN THE SUITE BEDROOM \nA round bed with pink tuck'n'roll headboard. It's impossible to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it were achieved by laughing. \nAthena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of stone from her tapestry bag. She caresses it and carries it like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows. \nThen she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching high-heeled slippers. \nAnd these she places with reverence on the bed. \nATHENA On this night, oh great goddess Diana, we restore your virgin flesh and bring you back to real life. \nCLOSE ON the rock slab. We hold the artifact. \nATHENA Soon -- I take you to the pond for a cleansing. Well, it's a swimming pool, but it will be under the setting sun, okay? \nINT. FRONT DESK--DUSK FALLS \nJust as Ted is recovering from the mystery of this first guest, Elspeth arrives. \nShe has skin like marble, the body of Venus, piercing blue eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like Honey West in a rubber dress. She carries several bags, and a silver sword on her shoulder. \nTED May I help you? \nELSPETH I... we... have a reservation. \nThen she snaps, irritated, behind her. \nELSPETH Kiva! \nANGLE ON a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a long leather coat, wearing a tight T-shirt with studs spelling \"PUSSY\" across her breasts. This is Kiva. \nKiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette machine. Just as Ted's eyes grow wide with anxiety, several packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent's hands. \nKIVA Wait up, gawd! I had to get supplies for this boring ass night. \nELSPETH (to Ted) We have a reservation in the Honeymoon Suite. \nTED Oh yeah... you must be one of \"the others.\" And what're you carrying -- the Rock of Gibraltar? \nShe stares at him without humor. He fumbles for the key. He walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile luggage. Jars clang inside. He is ready to go, but Elspeth turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking, as Kiva lights up. \nELSPETH What'd I tell you about smoking? \nKIVA You smoke. \nELSPETH That's right -- I smoke, and I'm addicted to it, and I don't want the same thing to happen to you. \nKIVA (in game-show host voice) \"Hello -- welcome to this week's edition of the Hypocrite of the Year Award --\" \nAs Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host, Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with an unruly child. Ted waits, luggage in hand. \nELSPETH Kiva! That's enough -- \nShe cuts Kiva's ramble off. Kiva blows smoke defiantly. \nKIVA You're not my mother! \nELSPETH Yes I am. \nKIVA Then why're we sleeping together? \nELSPETH Your nose. \nAnd saying this, she kisses Kiva's nose and leaves the room. Kiva is quieted now. As Elspeth closes the bedroom door, she has the last word. \nELSPETH And I saw you checking her out. \nKiva slinks back on the bed, put in her place -- for now. \nIN THE HALLWAY/EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK \nThe doors open and Ted pushes a cart of expensive designer luggage -- and lots of it -- behind yet another Gorgeous Gal. This one is Jezebel, a Southern beauty, fawning over her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the hall like a Southern princess. \nJEZEBEL (talking to her cat in baby talk) Oh you little stinker... oh you sweet little muffin. Yes... Mama loves the baby. \nAT THE DOOR \nJezebel bursts in, chattering. \nJEZEBEL Well, this is just darlin'! Just darlin' Hi-dee, girls... \nTed carries all her bags inside awkwardly. Again, the place has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of exotic cloths and fixings. Elspeth and Athena are hard at work on a strange nature sculpture as Jezebel enters. She stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub, which now has dark blue water swirling inside. She presents her cat -- upward toward heaven -- frees the cat, bares her breasts and sucks in the vibes: \"Ahhhh.\" \nTed settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms, but her back is to him. The kitty rubs on her leg. She picks it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it sweetly. She winks and hands him a tip. \nJEZEBEL Toodle-loo. \nAnd saying this, she shoos him away. Through the glass doors to the bedroom, she sees Kiva sprawled on the bed, writing on herself. \nJEZEBEL Well -- I see Elspeth has herself a new lil' fool -- what the hell is she doin' here on our night of annual ritual? \nATHENA (wearily) I have sanctioned her presence, as long as she behaves. Come on -- there is more work to be done to welcome our great Diana. \nKIVA I WANT ROOM SERVICE!! \nELSPETH Why do I always attract girls who are looking for a babysitter? \nJEZEBEL Well now, honey, maybe Juvenile Hall ain't the best place to find serious relationship material. \nElspeth seethes at her. Jezebel acts blithely innocent. \nIN THE HALLWAY \nTed is walking from the room with the cart. His face is etched in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his hand -- at least these lunachicks tip well. \nWaking him out of his deep mood is Raven. Another female intoxication, she wears a short skirt, all done up in Native American, Southwestern themes. No shoes. \nBut she carries a small, old handmade broom. She moves down the hall, blissed-out. Ted makes eye contact, despite himself. \nRAVEN I'm looking for the room for making love. \nTED You might be referring to the Honeymoon Suite. Straight thata way... you can't miss it -- see all that furniture in the hallway -- \nRAVEN Oh I know the way. I just wanted you to know that I knew where I was going and that you needn't bother yourself with me. The others are here -- great! \nTED (wearily) Oh yeah -- it's so great -- it's fantastic. \nRAVEN (in deep empathy) Ohhh... I know it all seems very strange but you're coping with us much better than the bellboys of past New Year's. \nTED Past New Year's? \nRAVEN Oh yes -- we've been coming here every New Year... for a long time. Thanks for your patience. \nTED Oh hey -- no problem -- wreck the place. Bring in cats. Ruin the carpet with flea powder, pour paint in the Jacuzzi. Throw the furniture out the... where're your bags? \nRAVEN I travel very light. \nTed looks down at the broom at her side, her bare feets, her thick dark hair. It keeps getting weirder. She wanders off. \nINT. FRONT DESK--NIGHT \nThe last of the lovely girls arrives. She is different from the others. She looks like a farm girl, very Earth Mother, with a tablecloth halter top and skirt, sandals, and a simple scarf over her long dark curls. She carries two bags by herself and holds a small black pot under her arm. She is Eva. \nTED (already weary of these girls) Yeah, yeah, Honeymoon Suite. \nEVA Oh... yes... I'm late. \nShe lowers her eyes, worried. \nTED All right -- lemme give ya a hand. \nEVA Oh... no, that's all right. I can carry them by myself. \nJezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction of Kiva, sitting idly on the edge of the blue water Jacuzzi, with her feet dipping irreverently in the water. \nELSPETH Kiva... \nKIVA What? \nELSPETH You have to go in the next room now. \nKIVA Oh, wow, like I'm bummed out that I can't watch. (whining at Elspeth) I'm bored! \nELSPETH UP! \nShe climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her feet. \nKIVA Don't put me in there by myself. I'll miss you way too much. \nELSPETH Kiva, don't do this to me. \nKiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of the Jacuzzi. She begins to speak softly. \nKIVA Please... if you just lemme... I'll play dress-up with you, the way you like it... you know what I mean... remember...? \nElspeth begins to weaken. But continues to pull the brat up. Kiva pours on softer seduction. \nKIVA We can pretend and I'll do it exactly... the way you want it... with the egg whites and the kilt. \nElspeth is now fully seduced. Kiva takes Elspeth's hand and presses it lightly on her face. \nELSPETH You mean... like last week? \nKiva nods. Elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted \"ick\" sound from Jezebel, Elspeth realizes she's revealing this side of her life -- in front of her coven. She nervously looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted Jezebel, an understanding Raven, a preoccupied Eva and an impatient and stern Athena. \nElspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture. \nELSPETH We'll talk about this later, Kiva. \nKIVA (angrily) No! \nShe turns on Elspeth and bites her hand. Elspeth pulls her arm away and grabs Kiva by the hair. \nJEZEBEL Aw, really now -- child abuse? \nELSPETH You stay outta this! \nATHENA I demand this stop now, Elspeth! \nElspeth lets go of Kiva's hair. Kiva jerks away from her. \nKIVA I'm running away from you! \nELSPETH Fine. Go ahead. And I'll call your parole officer and she'll find you and send you back to Eastlake! \nKiva stomps off into the bedroom. \nATHENA Now that the fucking melodrama is over, can we start the goddamn ritual -- pleeze? \nElspeth enters the powered circle. Each girl takes off her shoes. They anoint themselves with oils. \nATHENA We are communing here on New Year's Eve to bring to life the great goddess Diana, who was turned to stone in this very room forty years ago today. \nThe girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to sway within the circle. \nATHENA Diana, great beautiful one, we make these offerings to you, that we may undo the wicked spell which deprived you of the seed of your lover, your virginal blood, of your very life. We now form the symbolic rock with our bodies. \nAnd saying this, the girls all form a \"rock\" with their bodies gracefully draped one upon the other. Music begins, and slowly they start to unfold from the rock. \nThe girls each find their place in a semicircle around the Jacuzzi. Some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of clothes. They anoint their arms with water from the Jacuzzi. \nThey begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the semicircle. The first one to go from one end to the other is Athena. She then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself between the altar and the Jacuzzi. She steps forth with a bottle to the altar and pours it into the Jacuzzi. \nATHENA On this night, in this hour, we Call upon the Ancient Power O Goddess bride, I offer thee Milk from a mother's sweet titty! \nEach of the girls moans eerily. Athena places the bottle on the altar and bows away. She joins the circle as Elspeth now steps forward with her offering in a vial. \nELSPETH To reverse the evil which has been done I make this offering to the Divine One A whore not, an innocent was, For whom I seized a virgin's blood. \nJEZEBEL Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust, To undo this awful spell is a real must. To bring you life and get you high I offer the sweat of five men's thighs. \nThe girls moan loudly as they sway. Jezebel places her offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle. Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. She unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor. \nRAVEN Diana, oh great one, we live without sun Until this wicked curse is undone. In hope that you live, and to us appear, I have collected a year's worth of tears. \nHe postures proudly, all puffed out. Eva looks at him helplessly. And he paternally encourages her to explain. \nEVA Well... okay. The five of us -- Elspeth, Jezebel, Athena, Raven and me -- are a coven. \nTED Ha, like a coven of witches? \nEVA Yes. \nTED (stunned) Oh. \nHe looks around the room: QUICK CUTS of candles, iconography, jars of lurid substances, unknown body parts of animals woven into the nature sculpture... and are those tongues in that can? Ted's getting the creeps, but again puffs himself up. \nTED I knew that! \nEVA (getting calmer) And you see, our coven has spent forty years trying to perfect a ritual to undo a wicked curse put on our goddess Diana. \nTED Gee, you don't look a day over twenty! \nEVA Oh... ha ha... I mean the witches before us tried and failed. But Athena, our High Priestess, discovered a great potion to reverse the evil spell which turned our beautiful goddess into an old rock. \nTED (looking at the rock) Yeah? Is... is that her? \nEva nods, looking lovingly at the stone. \nEVA She was a beautiful virgin. An entertainer by trade, but a great sorceress by design. It was here in this very room, on her wedding night, a jealous rival placed the curse on Diana. \nTED She turned to -- that -- here? \nEVA Yes... and her young husband turned into a pink fish! They found him swimming in the pool in circles. While our dear goddess: a stone in her honeymoon bed. \nTed frowns as he ponders all this. Eva takes a photo from the altar and hands it to Ted. \nEVA This was Diana. \nCLOSE ON photo: a Blond Bombshell in full-on Betty Page attire, a bare-tittied pinup girl, playfully spanking a girl in bondage with a spiked high heel. \nTED This girl here? This is the goddess Diana? \nThe photograph slowly comes alive. Diana stops spanking the girl and unties her. \nShe pulls the girl (in the black satin mask) up off her lap and makes the girl stand. The women face each other and break into a cheek-to-cheek tango. \nCLOSE ON Ted as he shakes his head. Are his eyes playing tricks on him? \nTED I hate to tell you this, but I kinda doubt she was a virgin. \nEVA Oh, but she was! She had lovers, but she saved that for marriage. Which is the example I've tried to follow: to do everything but that till I marry... \nShe begins to sob again. Ted comforts her. \nTED Hey, don't cry... a virgin is a rare and beautiful thing. If you say she was a virgin, I'll believe it. \nEVA Well, it doesn't matter now... and she won't be resurrected tonight 'cause I failed her. I let my whole coven down! \nTED Wait a sec -- that rock was gonna turn back into this? \nHe holds up the photo. Eva nods. \nTED Now, that would be something worth seeing! \nEVA Only, not now -- we were each supposed to bring something -- a life fluid. \nTED (wincing in disgust) If this is gonna be like one of those afterbirth conversations, I don't think I wanna hear this. \nEVA Only... I swallowed it... \nTED You swallowed what? \nEva looks off. Ted searches his brains, thoroughly sickened now. \nTED You mean, you were supposed to bring... like... like a guy's... and you...? \nShe nods; he winces, queasy. Eva looks at him, helpless. \nEVA And now, you're my last chance! \nTED (laughing) Yeah, sure. (then -- panic) Whoa, what? You want my -- for the -- witchy poo -- ahh no -- no way -- nope. Besides, it's against hotel policy. I was warned: \"No sex with the clientele\"! \nEva sobs, pleading. She throws off her shawl, baring her lovely breasts, and reaches her arms around his neck. He keeps backing off. Unbeknownst to him, he is already doing a ritualistic shuffle. \nTED Ha, c'mon now, joke's over. (seeing this is no joke) Hey, we're gonna step in the flea powder. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHOURS LATER \nAthena reads from a huge leatherbound book, The Book of Shadows, full of potions and spells. Four discouraged witches pack their bags. The room has been restored to its worldly under-splendor. Kiva uses the remote on the TV... so much for witchcraft. The slab of rock remains a slab. \nATHENA I don't understand what went wrong. \nELSPETH I say Eva pulled one over on us. \nEVA What? \nJEZEBEL Honey -- Eva was wearing the face of someone just fucked good... and the best actress in this world, or any other, can't fake a thing like that! \nELSPETH Exactly -- if she was fucked so good, how could she save his come? \nRAVEN It could be done... \nATHENA Girls, knock it off. (she looks up from the book) Maybe... maybe it needed to be the sperm of a virgin male. \nEVA (dreamily) He was no virgin! \nThe witches sadly collect their things. Athena, deep in thought, strokes the slab. \nATHENA Let's leave her here, with the sword, until dawn. I will come back for her before checkout time. I just... feel too sad to carry her away before the sun comes up to warm her. \nThey all agree. They pick up their bags and head out. \nJEZEBEL (cuddling her cat) I can't believe we have to carry our own bags out! My mama would have a hissy fit! \nKIVA (flirtatiously) I'll carry your bags. \nELSPETH (firmly) You're carrying my bags! \nThey leave the room. Jezebel's cat leaps from her arms as she hoists her luggage. Eva walks out satisfied, thought perhaps a little sore -- \"ouch,\" she says, and smiles. Athena takes one last look at their goddess slab. \nATHENA Next year, we try again -- with virgin sperm. \nShe closes the door on the Honeymoon Suite (till next New Year's Eve!). \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFOUR ROOMS \nFADE UP ON: \nINT. MON SIGNOR LOBBY--NIGHT \nTed behind the desk, on the phone. We only hear his side. \nTED Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? Do you want milk and cookies, or do you not? (pause) I can't turn on an adult station without permission from your parents. (pause, he checks his computer) That's not what the machine tells me. (pause) You be good and you'll get milk and cookies, but for now leave me alone, please. I'll be up later to put you both to sleep. \nHe hangs up. \nTED (to himself) Goddamn kids. \nSUPER: 1:00 a.m. \nThe phone rings again. \nTED Room Service. \nINT. ROOM 404--NIGHT \nA small party is going on. A long-haired Yuppie Scum type in on the line. Music BLARES. People dance in background. \nYUPPIE SCUM What room am I in? \nINT. FRONT DESK--NIGHT \nBACK AND FORTH \nTED This is the front desk, sir. \nThe Yuppie turns away from the phone and speaks to Real Theodore. \nYUPPIE SCUM What room are we in? \nREAL THEODORE How should I know? I just got here. \nYUPPIE SCUM (into phone) You know, don't you have one of those light things? \nSIGFRIED I'm psychic, Theodore. \nTED Look my name is Ted, actually, and I have no idea what's going on here, but I've obviously come at a bad time. \nSIGFRIED Let's not belabor the fact that you have no sense of timing, Theodore. The fact is you're here. \nSigfried turns to Angela. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) And I couldn't think of a better time for you to introduce me to your beau than on New Year's Eve. \nTED Oh fuck, there's a mistake. You're fucking wrong here. My name is Theodore, yes! My mother named me that and I hate the name. But I'm a fucking bellhop. People call me Ted. I work here. \nSuddenly, with great force, Sigfried slams the butt of his pistol smack into Ted's temple, sending him to the floor. Ted looks up at Sigfried in shock. \nSIGFRIED Look, I'd love to sit here all night with you talking about things like when you broke in your first mitt -- (pause) That was insensitive of me, wasn't it, T H E O D O R E? But let's cut to the chase, okay? \nTED Okay. \nSIGFRIED So apologize! \nA tense silence fills the room. All eyes are on Ted, who can't figure out what the fuck this guy wants. \nTED For what? \nSigfried looks hard with disbelief at Ted, who winces back. \nSIGFRIED You are really beginning to annoy me, Theodore. \nSigfried throws another handful of pills into his mouth. \nTED Look, obviously you two are working something out and if I could help you with your problem I would. \nSIGFRIED What are you saying? Are you saying I got a problem? Are you trying to say I don't give her what she needs? That I'm FUCKING INSENSITIVE!! \nTED Look, is this about another man? Or something? \nTed has struck a raw nerve. Sigfried's mood swings drastically; he bends down next to Ted. \nSIGFRIED Let's get our ABC's right, here, Theodore. Theodore, right? \nTED Ted's better. \nSIGFRIED Ted, okay... Are you saying my wife cheats on me? \nTED I didn't say that... I... \nSIGFRIED Oh, for Christ's sake, Theodore, this is about as intimate a situation as you can get, you, me, and Angela here. It's pretty cozy. To say nothing of how stupid an idea it is to lie to a man with a loaded gun without considering the possible response. I demand an apology! \nThe phone rings. \nSIGFRIED Don't move. I've got to take this. \nSigfried glances at it. Then to Angela. He picks up the phone. \nSIGFRIED (into phone) What? (pause) We ain't got any needles here, kid. Just a big fucking gun. \nHe listens to the other line, says good-bye, and hangs up. \nSIGFRIED (to Ted) Now, where was I? Oh yeah, I remember. \nSigfried kneels next to Ted and assumes a prayer position. \nSIGFRIED I want you to pray for forgiveness, Theodore. \nSigfried, hands clasped together, signals for Ted to do the same. The gun lies at his side. Ted considers a bold move, but thinks better of it. Sigfried's eyes pop open. He cuts a look to Ted, signaling him to assume the pose. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) Now say after me, \"I apologize...\" \nTED I apologize... \nSIGFRIED For what? \nTed looks to Angela for help. She can only stare back with intense, wide-open eyes. \nSIGFRIED For fucking what? \nTED That I said you might have been unfaithful? \nSIGFRIED \"That I said you might have been unfaithful?\" Listen, Theodore, you're in church here... you're kneeling in front of an altar. Truth... truth is all it hears. Say the following, \"I, Theodore, must humbly and sincerely apologize for saying that you fucked another man!\" \nTed repeats what Sigfried has told him. This appears to have a calming effect on Sigfried, who gets up off the floor, turning his face to Angela. \nTED And make me an accessory in the murder of your husband? \nTed collapses to his knees in front of Angela. \nTED That's not fair. It just isn't fair. \nANGELA Get a fucking grip on yourself. First off, who says he's my husband? And second, we are a long way from fair here, fair is back in jolly old England eatin' crumpets and sipping on tea. \nTed collects himself. \nTED Tut. Tut. Tut. Not so fast. Well, maybe there are two sides to this thing. \nANGELA There are two sides to a plate, still you only eat off of one. Now GET THE GUN! \nTED So why's he got you tied up? \nANGELA I'm a werewolf, Ted! Get the gun! \nTed is at a loss as to what to do. Angela turns on the charm. \nANGELA Come on, Ted. Come over here just for a minute. You can do it. Come on, Ted. You look like a good guy. \nTed creeps towards her. \nANGELA That's it, Teddy. You look so much more attractive when you're self- assured. \nSigfried suddenly comes to life... He's heard from the bathroom belting out \"Life is but a dream... she-boom, she- boom.\" \nANGELA (she panics) Quick, he's coming back. Put the gag back in, and remember the gun! \nTed hurries to replace the sock in her mouth. \nTED Nine thousand, three hundred and twenty-two times, to the best of my estimation. \nINT. ROOM \nSigfried coughs, sending a chill up Ted's spine. Ted whips around to discover Sigfried leaning up against the door to the bathroom. \nSIGFRIED I was just beginning to think I could trust you, Theodore. Silly me. \nTed's fingers are frozen over Angela's lips. \nTED I was just trying to help her breathe a little. \nSIGFRIED Don't let me stop you, Teddy. You don't mind me calling you Teddy, do you? \nTED That's fine. \nSIGFRIED I used to have a little bunny rabbit named Teddy, it looked real cute nibbling on Angela's ear. Only problem here is you're no bunny rabbit, Theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes me to picture you doin' it. But don't let me stop you, Teddy... no need to play sneaky-poo. \nTed starts to back toward the door. \nTED Look, man, if this is some kind of Voodoo thing and you want me to have sex with your wife, there is absolutely no way. \nSIGFRIED (shouts at the top of his lungs) I said, nibble, asshole! Now! \nThe directness of Sigfried's command, coupled with the SOUND of a trigger being cocked, forces Ted to approach Angela. Angela is a stunning beauty, and Ted being kind of a shy guy makes for an awkward situation. Ted leans forward. As he closes in, Angela's eyes close. \nTED (whispers) Sorry, lady. \nTed pulls up short of actually nibbling on Angela. \nSIGFRIED What's the matter, no whiz left in the cheese? I'm not cramping your style, am I? \nTED Look, I'm not playing this game anymore. \nSigfried yanks Ted backwards. He wraps his arms around him. \nSIGFRIED It's almost all over, Theodore, and soon you can go home to Mommy. \nTed struggles to free himself from Sigfried's powerful bear hug and blasts out the following monologue. \nTED My name is not Theodore, it's TED, TED, TED, T... E... D... TED... NOT TEDDY, NOT THEODORE... TED... Yes, my mother did me the service of naming me Theodore and I haven't a clue as to how you know that because everyone who knows that lives a long way away from here. Do you have any idea what it's like to go to school where all the other kids' parents are in jail doing time for crimes like grand larceny, aggravated assault, burglary and murder, and you get stuck with a mother who names you Theodore and dressed you up in little matching pink outfits with, get this, a little blue bow fucking tie! Well, I'll tell you what happens. Pretty soon Theodore becomes \"Theo the Thumper,\" and when Theo the Thumper gets old enough, he packs his bags and goes thousands of miles away where he can put the whole bloody mess behind him. So, if you don't mind, shoot me now, because no one is going to call me that again. My name is Ted, okay? Got it? TED! \nSigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence. He takes a step toward Ted and offers him his hand. \nSIGFRIED Sigfried. \nTED What? \nSIGFRIED My name is Sigfried. \nTED You people gonna be okay? \nAngela sits next to Sigfried and gently strokes his back. \nANGELA We're fine, Ted. \nTed points to a tray with half-eaten food on it. \nTED Would you like me to...? \nANGELA Another time, Ted. \nTed slowly walks toward the door and takes one last look at the strange couple at rest in the corner of the room before closing the door behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY--MOMENTS LATER \nTed walks down the hallway, lost in thought. An energetic Young Guy with a bouquet of flowers plows into him. \nYOUNG GUY Happy New Year, buddy. \nTED Happy New Year. \nYOUNG GUY I was just in room 404, what a party! You know where room 409 is at? \nTED Beats me. It's somewhere around here. \nThe guy takes off in the direction Ted's walking from. Ted suddenly realizes who this guy is and whips around, shouting to the Young Guy. \nTED (continuing) Hey, what's your name? \nThe door SLAMS on room 409. \nFADE OUT \nFADE TO BLACK \nSTORY TITLE CARD: \nROOM 716 \"THE MISBEHAVERS\" \nFADE UP \nTHE FRONT DESK \nSUPER: 10:30 p.m. \nTed is relaxing at the front desk. He breathes slowly. He finally has one moment's peace after an already long night. He even has a chance to straighten his tie. \nThe phone RINGS. \nTED Front desk. \nCUT TO: \nROOM 716 \nCLOSE-UP of a cigarette hanging out of a Man's mouth as he speaks into the telephone. \nMAN Bottle of Moet et Chandon. Fast. \nMan hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an already overstuffed ashtray by the bed. Man turns around to face the camera. He is a dark and handsome Latin male in his mid-30s. Dangerous. Impatient. \nHe walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his tie. \nHe stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his Wife and two kids get ready for the party. Wife seems to be a beautiful woman in her mid-30s. The children are Sarah, nine, and Juancho, six. \nMan strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie. \nHe watches his Wife comb Juancho's hair down and to the side like an idiot. \nNot being able to stand it anymore, Man tears Juancho away from his Wife and snatches the comb. \nMAN Give me that... \nMan begins to slick Juancho's hair back. \nMAN There... see? You look cool with your hair up like this. Like me... \nJuancho is smiling now. He's happy he's going to look like his dad. \nMAN (to the children) His name is Ted. If you need anything, dial 0 and ask for Ted. \nSarah catches the name tag and reads the name on it: \"TED -- BELLHOP.\" \nSarah looks up at Ted. She clips the pin to her dress and smiles shyly at him. \nMan puts the money in Ted's pocket and then grabs his ear, pulling him close. \nMAN (deadly whisper) If something happens to my children, I wouldn't want to be you. \nWIFE Make sure they're in bed before midnight. \nTED (thinking) Before midnight? Then should I wake them up for the countdown to the New Year? \nWife looks disgusted. \nWIFE No... \nAs Man and Wife exit, he turns to the kids and says: \nMAN Don't misbehave. \nMan closes the door. \nINT. HALLWAY \nMan and Wife book it down the hall before Ted can change his mind. \nROOM 716 \nTed is standing facing the door the Man and Wife just disappeared through. He turns around slowly to face the children. \nHis eyes are wide. His face is quiet. Stern. \nThe children are staring at him. \nTED Okay. These are the rules. Don't break the rules and I won't break your necks. \nThe kids look at each other. \nTED (smiling) I always wanted to say that. Someone said that to me when I was a kid. \nSarah laughs at his joke. \nTED Except they were joking. I'm not. \nTed goes to the door. \nTED The rules are simple. Don't do anything you wouldn't do if your parents were here. If there's an emergency, call me on the phone, like your dad said. \nSARAH That's not what he said. \nTed's surprised by a challenge this early in the game. \nSARAH He said to call if we need anything. \nTED Well, I've got a lot of work to do and I can't have you calling me every time you want a drink of water, so please limit your calls to emergencies only. \nSARAH We paid you five hundred dollars. We'll call you if we need anything. You don't want to upset my dad. \nTED Okay. Please. Try to call only when necessary. Watch TV, and if you're good, I'll bring up some milk and cookies. Bye. \nTed leaves. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY \nTed walks briskly down the hall, counting his money the whole way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROOM \nJuancho takes off his socks and shoes and throws them onto the floor. Sarah looks at the discarded shoes and socks. \nCLOSE ON the shoes and socks. \nSarah looks over at Juancho's bare feet. Her nose twitches. \nSARAH Your feet stink. \nSarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room. It's only a matter of time before he finds mischief. \nJuancho sees the champagne bucket and Bingo!, he goes for the bottle. \nJUANCHO (holding up the bottle) Hey, get a bottle opener! \nSarah opens her mouth, as if about to tell him to leave the champagne alone. She stops herself when she realizes she wants some champagne too. \nShe quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while Juancho unwraps the bottle top. \nSarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer slide forward. \nSome coins, a paperclip, and a hypodermic needle. She looks down at the needle that lays beside the Gideon Bible and casually picks the phone back up and punches 0. The phone rings. \nFRONT DESK \nTed, bucket of ice in his hand, gets ready to go to room 404. As he crosses the desk, the phone rings. He looks at the board and see room 716's light blinking. \nHe sighs in exasperation. \nINT. ROOM \nSarah sees Juancho shaking the champagne bottle violently. \nSARAH Don't shake it! (into phone) Ted? Hi. It's me. Sarah. \nTED Yeah. Who died? No one? Then don't call me. \nSARAH I thought I'd tell you that your cleaning ladies are doing a bum job. There's all kinds of leftover stuff around here. \nSarah picks up the needle and rolls it over in her hand several times. \nSARAH Needles and things. We're not supposed to have needles here, are we? I mean, they don't come with the room, do they? Send someone up here to clean this place up right. \nThe champagne bottle explodes all over Juancho. He looks surprised. \nSARAH (to Juancho) I TOLD YOU NOT TO SHAKE IT! (to Ted) I gotta go. My brother just exploded the champagne all over the room. Oh, and bring us a couple of toothbrushes. There's a card in the bathroom that says you'll bring free toothbrushes if we ask for them. \nShe hangs up. \nA frustrated Ted hangs up the phone. He walks briskly to the elevator. \nSarah and Juancho are pouring themselves champagne. They turn up the television and drink. Juancho shudders at the taste, but tries to drink as much as Sarah. \nSarah clearly doesn't like it, but tries to pretend she does. \nSarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how to make room-to-room calls. \nSARAH I'm calling another room, give me three numbers. \nJUANCHO \nSarah punches in the room number. The phone rings. \nShe holds the needle up to the light to examine it. \nSARAH Hello? Hi. You don't know me, and I don't know you, but... do you have any needles? We've got needles here and I was wondering if they come with the room or not. Don't have any? Thanks. Just checking. \nShe hangs up. \nJuancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his father's coat pocket. He finds a pack of cigarettes and takes one out. He puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke. \nSarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully. She has an idea. \nMONTAGE: \nIn the bathroom, Sarah seeks out her mother's lipstick. \nROOM 716 \nSarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick to draw a bull's-eye on one of the hotel art paintings. She writes numbers next to each circle representing points. \nJuancho is standing at the foot of the bed, cigarette hanging out of his mouth, as he practices his dart-throwing technique. \nSARAH (pointing out the rules) The center is the bull's eye, 100 points, this one's 10 points, this one's 20 points. \nWHACK! The needle lands an inch from her face in the 20-point slot. \nSARAH Hey, wait a minute. Let me get out of the way! \nSarah, a little tipsy now, grabs the needle and staggers to the bed. She hears the key in the doorway and throws the needle into the curtain to hide it. \nTED Yes... I did. \nThe children are quiet. \nTED And now look at me. \nCHILDREN (in unison) We can't. \nTED Good. You'll do just fine. Sleep well and I won't tell your parents about the champagne. \nTed leaves. \nCUT TO: \nAFTER A MOMENT OF DARKNESS \nAfter a moment of darkness, the night is disturbed by the loud crashing of fireworks outside the window. \nSarah sits up, eyes closed. Her face feels the warmth coming from the window and she tilts her head toward it. \nThe light of the fireworks dances its reflections off her face. \nShe inhales deeply... then makes a sour face. She goes for the bathroom, arms outstretched like a blind girl. She gets to the bathroom, turns on the light, and searches for the sink. \nShe begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very carefully. She dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them... checks them in the mirror. A little red, but otherwise fine. \nShe goes back into the bedroom, turns on the television and grabs the new champagne bottle. She shakes it violently. \nJuancho wakes. He turns his head to her. His eyes are still closed. \nJUANCHO Are you watching TV? \nThe champagne bottle explodes. She pours herself a glass. \nSARAH Yep. If you wanna watch too, you have to go wash your face. \nJuancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the bathroom. He slams into the wall, hard. \nSARAH Be careful... \nJuancho walks into the bathroom a little slower, more cautious. \nSarah pours herself another glass. She downs the glass and shudders. \nShe smells the bad smell again. Only now she really smells it. \nShe smells her feet. Nothing. She smells the champagne. Nothing. \nJuancho enters the room and sits on the bed. Sarah grabs his foot and smells it. \nShe drops his foot. \nJuancho stares blankly at her. \nSarah looks down at the mattress. She smells the mattress. \nJuancho looks at her as if she's drunk. \nSarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights. She takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle, then stalks toward the mattress. \nJuancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back. \nSarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough to see what is underneath it. \nJuancho screams. Sarah is too stunned to scream. Stuffed into the bedsprings is a woman's dead and beaten corpse. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON \nTed's phone ringing. \nTed looks at the phone as if pondering whether or not to answer it. He taps his fingers. Finally he answers the phone. \nROOM 716 \nSARAH Ted! \nTED What do you want now, for Christ's sake! Who died? \nSARAH (near tears) I don't know, but she's in my bed! \nSARAH Check under the mattress! \nTED For what? \nSARAH (crying) For the body, can't you smell it? \nTED It's your feet! \nSarah grabs the mattress and pulls it off herself. \nTed sees the rotting corpse. \nVomit spews out of Ted's mouth. \nTED (gurgles through vomit- spewing lips) Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck is this? \nHe tears at the phone. \nTED (into the phone) Police, it's an emergency! (pause) Hello, Police, this is the Mon Signor Hotel, get someone up here right fucking now, there's a DEAD WHORE stuffed under the mattress! \nTears well in Sarah's eyes as she looks at the body. \nSARAH Don't call her that... \nTED (into the phone) I'm dead fucking serious, there's a dead fucking Whore stuffed in the bedsprings of the fucking bed! \nSARAH Stop calling her that!! \nSarah grabs the hypodermic needle from under the curtain and stabs it into Ted's leg. \nTED FUCK!! \nSarah steps back, almost tripping over the champagne bottle. She picks up the bottle and holds it defensively in case Ted tries to retaliate. Ted spins around, now noticing the needle sticking out of his leg. \nTED Jesus!! \nJuancho lights up another cigarette. \nThe champagne spill has spread to the fallen cigarette butt. The carpet bursts into flames around the spill. \nCUT OUTSIDE TO: \nEXT. ROOM \nCLOSE ON a key going into the keyhole outside. \nBACK TO: \nROOM 716 \nTed tries to pull the syringe out of his leg, but yanking it makes it break in two, the plunger in his hand, and the needle still stuck in his leg. \nTed staggers and grabs hold of the dead woman's foot for support as he steps on the remote control, flipping the TV on to the Nudie channel, just as... \nMan opens the door. \nMan stands at the door, drunk Wife unconscious on one arm, the door knob in the other hand. He's looking mean. \nMan's POV: focused on the dead woman in the bedsprings. We pan up the dead woman's leg to find Ted holding her foot. We pan down Ted's leg to find the hypodermic needle jutting out... then pan over to the other hand holding the broken syringe plunger. \nWe pan over to the Nudie channel, then down to the fire blazing behind the children. Pan up to the dripping champagne bottle in Sarah's hand, then over to the cigarette hanging out of Juancho's mouth. Juancho tosses his cigarette out of his mouth to an area behind him. Another blaze starts immediately. \nMan drops his Wife to the floor. \nIn the WIDE SHOT of Ted and the children, we see that the fireworks are bursting big and bright outside the window behind them. Almost as bright as the flames eating through the room. \nMan simply glares at Ted. Finally Man speaks... \nMAN Did they misbehave? \nTed stares blankly at Man (the camera) as the sprinklers burst on... drenching the room as the picture \nFADES TO BLACK \nFOUR ROOMS \nFADE UP ON \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY--NIGHT \nSUPER: ONE MINUTE AFTER ROBERT'S STORY. TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE DAWN. \nMARGARET What kinda gun? \nTED I don't know, I'm not a gun guy. It was big. \nMARGARET Like Dirty Harry's gun. \nTED Yeah, something like that. \nMARGARET Did it have a real long barrel or a short barrel? \nTED What difference does it make? \nMARGARET Well, for one thing it's the difference between a .44 Magnum and a Magnum .357. \nTED Who cares if it was a .44 or a .392, it was a fuckin' loaded gun, pointed at my fuckin' head! \nMargaret takes this in. \nMARGARET You wanna skip over this part, too? \nTED I want you to get Betty on the phone! \nMARGARET Hold on. (yelling to the room) Anybody live here named... (to Ted) What's her name again? \nTED Betty. \nMARGARET Betty! \nThe sleepy room stirs. Betty wakes up from the floor. \nBETTY Yeah, whatcha screamin' about? \nMARGARET You're Betty? \nBETTY Yeah, I'm Betty, it's my fuckin' place, who the fuck are you? \nMARGARET I'm Margaret (hands her the phone) And this is Ted. \nBetty takes the phone. \nBETTY Ted, what's the problem? \nTED What's the problem? I don't got a problem, I got fuckin' problems! Wanna hear? \nBETTY (yawning, wiping sleep from her eyes) Sure. \nTED Well, most recently, there's room 716. There's a scary Mexican gangster dude pokin' his finger in my chest. There's his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me. There's the putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore stuffed in the springs of a bed. There're rooms blazing afire... There's a needle from God knows where stuck in my leg, infecting me with God knows what, and finally, there's me walking out the fuckin' door right now! Buenas noches. \nA RINGING SOUND happens that we haven't heard before. Ted's head turns toward it. \nIt's the guest board. And the top light, the penthouse, is ringing. It rings where all the others buzzed. \nBetty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line. The sound fully wakes her up. They start talking Howard Hawks style again. \nBETTY (suddenly alert) Is that the penthouse? \nTED Yeah. \nBETTY That's the Chester Rush party, they want something. \nTED Yeah, well, tough titty. They're just gonna have to wait, 'cause I'm out the door. \nBETTY (panicking) Now, Ted, wait a minute. I know you're freaked, I know you're stressed. You've had a real bad night -- \nTED Yes, Betty, I've had-a-real-bad-night -- \nBETTY -- You say there's a dead body in a room? \nTED Yes, I did. \nBETTY No problem, this is a hotel, we've had dead bodies before, it's just the price of doing business. You said the hotel was on fire. Is it still on fire? \nTED No, it's out. \nBETTY Good, sprinkler system worked like a charm. Now, you wanna leave, you've had enough. Perfectly understandable. I'll take care of everything else. The only thing I ask is that you take care of Chester Rush. Then you can leave. \nTED Now, look -- \nBETTY Ted, he's a very important guest of this hotel. In fact, he is the most important guest at the hotel. The Mon Signor used to be a haven for movie stars. Through the thirties and forties, and the first half of the fifties, more movie stars -- if you break it down on a night-by-night basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor than any other hotel in Hollywood. Now, we had some hard time in the eighties, even though we were the official hotel of Cannon Pictures, but we're coming back strong in the nineties. And a movie star clientele is important to that comeback. If we can keep stars of his magnitude happy, we're on our way. So, Ted, just take care of him, then you can leave. \nTED Look, I don't feel like -- \nThey clink glasses and drink. \nCHESTER Whadya say, Ted? \nTED Thank you? \nCHESTER No, not thank you. Whadya say about the tasty beverage? \nTED It's good. \nCHESTER Fuckin' good, Ted. It's fuckin' good. Let's try it again, shall we? So, Ted, whadya think about the beverage. \nTED It's fuckin' good. \nCHESTER You bet your sweet bippy, Ted. It's fuckin' Cristal, everything else is piss. \nNorman in the chair starts yelling at Ted. \nNORMAN Bellboy! Bellboy! Bellboy! \nTed knows he's being laughed at, but not why. \nCHESTER (to Norman) Knock it off, you're making my friend Ted here uneasy. (to Ted) Pay no attention to Norman here, Ted, he's just fuckin' wit' ya, that's all. That's from Quadrophenia. Now me, myself, when I think of bellboys I think of -- \"bellboy\" isn't an insult, is it? Is there another name for what you do that I'm ignorant of? Bellman, bellperson -- \nTED Bellboy's fine. \nCHESTER Good. I'm glad they haven't changed that. There's a friendliness to \"bellboy.\" As I was saying, Ted, when Norman thinks of bellboys, he thinks of Quadrophenia. \nBut me, when I think of bellboys, I think of The Bellboy, with Jerry Lewis. Didja ever see The Bellboy? \nTED No. \nCHESTER You should, it's one of Jerry's better movies. He never says a word through the entire film. A completely silent performance. How many actors can pull that off? And he has to go to France to get respect. That says it all about America right there. The minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper in this fuckin' country gonna write articles calling the man a genius. It's not right. It's not right and it's not fair. But why should that surprise anybody? When has America ever been fair? We might be right every once in a while, but we're very rarely fair. \nTED Where do you want this? \nCHESTER You in a hurry, Ted? \nTED (he is, but doesn't want to rush the movie star) No, not particularly. \nCHESTER Good, then stop playing \"Beat the Clock.\" Now let me introduce you to everybody. \nHe puts his arm around Ted and leads him around the room. \nAngela crosses frame, drink in hand. \nCHESTER Our friend from downstairs you already seem to be acquainted with. \nAs she snuggles up in a big comfy chair: \nANGELA Oh, me and Theodore go way back. Don't we, Theodore? \nTED The name's Ted, Angela. I only let people with loaded guns at my head call me Theodore. \nCHESTER Angela's like you, Ted, a newfound friend. \nANGELA We met at the pool. \nCHESTER (to Ted) Have you ever seen Angela in a one- piece? \nTED No. \nCHESTER Well, it's somethin' to see. (arm around Ted) The Man sitting in the chair, with the bottle of Jim Bean in his hand and the sense of humor, is Norman. Norman, say hello to Ted. \nNORMAN What's up? \nNorman shakes his hand. \nCHESTER The sociable son of a bitch on the telephone is Leo. And the person on the other end of the phone is his lovely wife Ellen. (to Leo) Leo, say hello to Ted. \nLeo breaks away from his phone conversation for two seconds. \nLEO Hi, Ted, glad you could make it. (back to phone) What? (pause) What does punctuality have to do with love? \nCHESTER Which brings me to me, Chester Rush, Ted. Pleased to meetcha. \nChester shakes Ted's hand. \nTED I know. I'm sorry I haven't seen your movie. \nChester stops. \nNORMAN (to Chester) I'm into it. \nCHESTER (to Ted) Go on. \nTED A donut. \nChester takes it and eats it. \nCHESTER That's for me. Continue. \nTED And a hatchet. \nCHESTER A hatchet as sharp as the devil himself is what I asked for. \nTED Well, you be the judge. \nTed holds the hatchet out for Chester to take. Norman snatches it instead. \nNORMAN I'll be the judge. \nNorman touches the end of the blade with his thumb. \nCHESTER Whadya think? \nNORMAN That's a sharp motherfucker. Bring all this bullshit over to the bar. \nCHESTER You heard him, Ted. \nTed is completely confused and starting to get a little scared, but he does what he's told. \nLeo slams down the phone. \nLEO Bitch! \nNORMAN You still married? \nLEO Maybe, maybe not, but I don't give a flyin' fuck either way. I've had it with that Machiavellian bitch! I'm too drunk to drive home. I'm sorry about that, I'm real sorry about that. I got drunk on New Year's Eve, cut my fuckin' head off... (noticing Ted at the bar) What's going on here? \nCHESTER We now return you to The Man from Rio, already in progress. \nLEO (surprised) Noooo, you're gonna do it? \nNORMAN Looks like. \nLEO You guys ain't bullshittin', you're gonna really go for it? \nAngela is still curled up. \nANGELA After talkin' about it all night, they better. I wanna see a show. \nCHESTER When we do it, you'll have something to see. \nLeo walks up to Norman and throws his arm around him. \nLEO You are one radical dude. \nTed doesn't know what anybody's talking about, which is just fine with him. He finishes laying out everything on the bar and says: \nTED Well, that's everything, so if you don't need me for anything else, I'll go back downstairs. \nCHESTER Not so fast, Ted. We ain't quite done yet. Why don't you take a seat at the bar, get comfortable, and have an open mind when we explain the festivities of the evening to you. \nTED Look, guys, you paid for the room. As long as you don't break up the furniture, you can do whatever the fuck you want. And me personally, I don't care if you break up the furniture. You don't have to explain anything to me. Whatever constitutes a good time as far as you guys are concerned is your business. \nCHESTER Well, it's your business, Ted. 'Cause we want you to take part. \nTED Take part in what? \nLEO Chester, your way of breaking the news to him gently is scarin' the shit outta him. \nANGELA Look at the poor guy. Just spit it out. \nLittle by little everybody has gathered around Ted. \nCHESTER First off, let me say that there's nothing homosexual about what we're going to ask you to do. There's nothing sexual at all about what we want. But I was thinkin' you might be thinkin' we want you to do some sex thing. Pee on us, suck us off, shit like that. Let me assure you nothing could be farther from what we want -- \nAngela interrupts: \nANGELA Can I jump in here? \nCHESTER No, you can't jump in here, this is my story. \nTED I gotta get out of here. \nTed abruptly gets up and makes a beeline for the door. \nChester whips out a hundred-dollar bill and quickly calls to Ted from his position at the bar. \nCHESTER Ted, I got a hundred-dollar bill here with your name on it, whether you do what we ask or not, just to sit back down in the chair for one minute more. \nTed spins in his direction. \nTED I'm not gonna cut off his finger! \nCHESTER Maybe you will and maybe you won't, but that has nothing to do with this hundred-dollar bill in my hand. You can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that door. But if you sit back down and wait sixty seconds before you do it, you'll be a hundred dollars richer. \nTed just stands across the room, thinking. \nANGELA Ted. Take the money. \nLEO Ted, you're gonna do whatever you want to do. We're just askin' you to indulge us for another minute more. And Chester's willin' to pay for it. \nTed thinks. \nTED I'll take your money, and I'll sit back down. But a minute from now, I'm gonna walk out the door, and when I do, there'll be no hard feelings? \nCHESTER Well, I want you to have a bit more of an open mind than that, but, yeah, we'll either convince you or we won't. No hard feelings. Right, guys? \nEverybody agrees. \nTed wearily sits back down. \nChester positions himself in front of Ted at the bar. \nCHESTER Okay, Leo, you be the timekeeper. Let us know when one minute begins and when it ends. \nLEO You got it. (he checks his watch) Gentlemen, start your engines. \nChester jumps up and down, loosening up. \nLEO Begin! \nChester, who talks fast anyway, starts his pitch. It's Chester who now plays \"Beat the Clock.\" \nCHESTER Okay, pay attention here, Ted, I ain't got much time. Now I'm gonna make two piles here on the bar. (he takes the hundred- dollar bill and lays it out on the bar) One pile, (pointing at the hundred-dollar bill) which is yours. And another pile, (Chester whips out a money roll fat enough to choke a horse to death) which could be yours. (he lays a matching hundred-dollar bill on the bar, starting a second pile) Now, what you have to be aware of is we're gonna do this bet, one way, (he lays another hundred on the end pile) or the other. (he lays another hundred on the pile) Whether it's you who holds the ax, (he lays another hundred on the pile) or the desk clerk downstairs, (he lays another hundred on the pile) or some bum we yank off the street. (he lays another hundred on the pile) \nNORMAN You can buy a lot of soup with that pile. \nCHESTER (to Norman) Shhhh, I'm the closer. (to the group) How much is on the bar already? I lost count. \nANGELA Six hundred. \nCHESTER Six hundred. Ted, do you know how long it takes the average American to count to six hundred? \nTED No. \nCHESTER (laying another bill on the pile) One minute less than it takes to count to seven hundred. You know, Ted, a person's life is made up of a zillion little experiences. (he lays another bill on the pile) Some, which have no meaning, are insignificant and you forget them. And some that stick with you for the rest of your natural life -- (he lays another bill on the pile) -- barring Alzheimer's of course. Now, what we're proposing is so unusual, so outside the norm, that I think it would be a pretty good guess that this will be one of those experiences that sticks. So, since you're gonna be stuck remembering this moment for the rest of your life, you gotta decide what that memory will be. (He lays down the last bill on the pile) So, are you gonna remember for the next forty years, give or take a decade, how you refused a thousand dollars for one second's worth of work, or how you made a thousand dollars for one second's worth of work? \nLEO Time! \nCHESTER Well, Ted, what's it gonna be? \nTed looks at the pile, then looks up. We dolly into his face. \nFLASHBACK \nWe see a quick MONTAGE of horrendous moments from all the other stories. \nINT. PENTHOUSE--NIGHT \nBack to Ted. \nTED Okay. \nThe group cheers. \nTED But when it's over, no matter what happens, I get the money? \nCHESTER As long as you do your part, you can take the pile, walk out the door, and not say another word. \nTED Let's do it right now, before I change my mind. \nNORMAN Here, here. \n", "test1_input": "\"FOUR ROOMS\" \nScreenplay by \nAllison Anders \nAlexandre Rockwell \nRobert Rodriguez \nQuentin Tarantino \nMAIN TITLES \nAs presentation credits begin, we hear Johnny Cash's \"Home of the Blues.\" Then we see Allison's name, under it Alex's, under that Robert's, under that Quentin's, then under that the title logo for Four Rooms, followed by \"Starring Tim Roth as the Bellboy.\" Then \"The Guests\" listed in alphabetical order of all the actors playing guests.

I'm the only one left from those days. It all comes down to one sap: the night-shift bellhop, that's me. What the hell is a bellhop? You know where the name comes from? (silence) Of course not... It's so simple it's stupid. They ring a bell and you hop. You hop to front and center. No heroes in this line, kid. Just men doing a job. No questions asked, none answered. I try to keep it simple, kid, not too personal... \nAnother voice of a young man interrupts. \nTED You met any of those old stars? \nTHE OLD GUY Stars! Are you kidding me? I took Rin Tin Tin out for a shit, for Christ's sakes. I taught Shirley Temple how to roller-skate. I saw Fatty Arbuckle regurgitate three cheese sandwiches right on the spot you're sitting, kid. What did you say your name was? \nTED Ted. \nTHE OLD GUY Ted, right. I remember Marilyn used to come down at night and doze off in the kitchen. She liked the sound of the fans out back spinning around. Sure, these were stars, kid. Errol Flynn used to call me \"Alibi.\" You'll pick up a few stories yourself, kid. \nTED I don't think so, not like yours. \nTHE OLD GUY What do you think a star does when he goes to the bathroom, kid? \nTED Beats me. \nTHE OLD GUY He pulls his pants down and takes a crap just like you and me. Take my word for it. \nA wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with a lip print on it signed \"Marilyn.\" The camera pulls back to reveal Ted and the Old Guy sitting on a foldout cot in a small back room of the Hotel Mon Signor. The old man is dressed in a striped T-shirt with a bellhop's cap on. He looks like an old pirate. Next to him on the bed sits Ted, a young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees. The old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar. \nTHE OLD GUY Camacho! \nTED Who? \nTHE OLD GUY The cigar. Cuban. A good cigar, wrapped in Miami. I get a box of them every Christmas from the chairman of the board. I think he sends them to me to keep my mouth shut. It's tough not to get a little personal in this business. \nThe old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares down at his cap, lost in thought. \nTED What do you mean? \nThe old guy passes the cap over to Ted. \nTHE OLD GUY Put it on. \nTed puts the cap on. \nTHE OLD GUY Frankly, you look stupid... like the Philip Morris guy. I can't believe I wore that thing for fifty years. You keep it. \nThe Old Guy gets up from the bed and throws a jacket on. Pulls a few postcards off the wall, throws them in an old straw suitcase, and slams the lid down. He heads for the door. Ted follows. \nTHE OLD GUY Stay away from night clerks, kids, hookers, and marital disputes. \nThe Old Guy pauses for a second and looks Ted dead in the eye. \nTHE OLD GUY Never have sex with the clientele. \nTED No way, not me. You got any other advice. \nTHE OLD GUY Always get a tip. \nThe door slams shut on the back room. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY--TWILIGHT \nThe big empty lobby of the Mon Signor. You can tell that at one point this used to be a swank place. It still is, kinda. It's also kinda decrepit. The concierge -- a snappy, fast- talking, red-haired young woman in a blue blazer named Betty -- stands behind the reception desk. The old man, suitcase in hand, makes a beeline through the lobby, heading toward the front door. Betty sees him. \n", "test1_true": "The Old Guy stops in his tracks and turns around. \nTHE OLD GUY What? \nBetty comes from behind the desk. \nBETTY I just want to say good-bye. \nTHE OLD GUY Who are you? \nBETTY Uhhh, Betty. The concierge. Your boss. \nThe Old Guy squints his eyes at the young gal. \nTHE OLD GUY Oh yeah. Gotta light, sister? Goddam cigar went out. \nBETTY Yeah, sure. \nShe speaks to the Old Guy as she lights his cigar and he puffs away. \nBETTY I just want you to know, from the owner and all the staff, your fifty years of service have been an inspiration to us all. You're a legend in your own time, and the Mon Signor will never be the -- \nTHE OLD GUY Just forward my cigars, Red. (He turns around the walks out, saying over his shoulder) Aufwiedersehen! \nBetty is left standing in the lobby. Ted appears behind her in his bellbody uniform, sans cap. \nTED Sam the bellboy. Now there was a man. \nBETTY Yeah. Oh, hi, Teddy. Ready to start the night shift? \nTED Yeah. \nBETTY Well, let me buy you a drink. \nTED You wanna buy me a drink? I'm starting my shift. \nBETTY You're not an alcoholic, are you; one drink won't kill you. \nTED Yeah, sure. \nThey walk out of frame. In the empty frame we \nSUPER: NEW YEAR'S EVE 7:00 P.M. \nINT. BACK ROOM--NIGHT \nBetty and Ted sit in the back room, both with drinks in their hand. This dialogue is to be delivered rapid fire, Howard Hawks style. \nBETTY After fifty years, Sam retires, and you're taking over the night shift. \nTED Correct. \nBETTY You're filling some mighty big shoes. \nTED Oh, I know. \nBETTY Sam was a legend in the hotel business. \nTED Oh, I know... \nBETTY A bellhop's bellhop. \nTED An inspiration to us all. \nBETTY He ran the night desk for fifty years, all by himself. \nTED An amazing man. \nBETTY No desk clerk. No night man. No help. Just fuckin' Sam, and his wits. \nTED A man alone. \nBETTY And you're gonna do the same. \nTED I know. \nBETTY Tonight. \nTed spews his drink. \nTED Tonight! \n", "test1_id": 3213, "test2_input": "ANGELA Where's the fucking nitro? \nTED I couldn't find it! \nANGELA You took long enough. Untie me, for Christ's sake, you fucking upset him and he's dying. \nTed struggles to untie Angela. \nTED I thought you wanted to kill him. \nANGELA You'd make a great cop, Theodore. \nThe knots are all over the place and a real bitch to untie. \nTED I can't handle this alone, I'd better get help. \nTed turns on a dime and runs smack into Sigfried, who's been taking in the whole conversation. \nSIGFRIED I tie a pretty good knot, don't I, Ted? \nTED Thank God you're okay... \nSIGFRIED Never felt better. \nAngela hears Sigfried's voice from behind her back. \nANGELA You bastard! \nSIGFRIED (to Angela) Come on, honey, don't get mad. It was just a little test, and I'm glad I did it because now I'll know forever that you really do love me. Truly and deeply. \nANGELA If the simple fact that I didn't want your bloated, dead body lying out on the floor is love, then no wonder we find ourselves as we are at this very fucking moment. \nSIGFRIED Oh, no. I heard you and there was genuine care in that voice. Can't be denied. Can it, Ted? \nTED I think you're right and, if you just keep this kind of open dialogue going, you'll go a long way to resolving this misunderstanding. \nTed edges his way toward the door. \nTED (continuing) You'd be surprised what happens when people just listen to each other without succumbing to all that pain and anger. \nANGELA You heard shit, monkey boy. Easy for you to say after you fuck another man's wife. You should at least have the guts to stand by your convictions. \nSigfried turns an icy eye on Ted, who has given up all hope of ever getting out of the room. \nTED That's a lie, Sigfried. I swear to God. \nAngela continues her tirade. \nANGELA When I think of all the times you were inside me promising me a better life, it makes me want to puke. \nSigfried slowly raises his gun, pointing it directly at Ted's chest. \nTED Why are you doing this? What have I ever done to you people? \nANGELA What didn't you do, stick man? Unfortunately, you don't have the balls to back up the actions of your huge cock. \nThe words hit Sigfried like bullets to the chest... his legs weaken. \nSIGFRIED (whimpering) He's got a huge cock? \nTED She's lying again, mister. It's not that big. \nSIGFRIED Show it to me. \nTED Come on, man, she's lying. Can't you see she's fucking with you? \nANGELA Put it this way, God made up for what he did to Gumby with Ted here. \nSIGFRIED Show it to me. \nANGELA Show him your cock, Theodore. \nSigfried runs over to Angela and kneels in front of her. \nSIGFRIED Stop talking about his cock, will you?! \nANGELA It's hard to stop talking about something so huge. I could go on and on about his cock, bone, nob, bishop, wang, thang, hotrod. Hump mobile, Oscar, dong, dagger, banana, cucumber, salami. Sausage, kielbasa, schlong, dink, tool, Big Ben, Mister Happy, prick, disk, pecker, peter, pee-pee, wee-wee, weiner, pisser, pistol, joint, hose, horn, middle-leg, third- leg, meat, stick, joystick, dipstick. \nAngela is on a roll. She fires the words at Sigfried, hitting him pointblank. He staggers. He pleads with her to stop, covering his ears. Ted watches the man crumble. \nANGELA (continuing) Junior, the little head, little guy, Rumple Foreskin, Tootsie Roll. Snake, one-eyed monster, one-eyed wonder, shaft, sword, meat whistle, skin flute, love muscle, Roto-Rooter, instrument, banger, rammer, ramrod, cherrypicker, log, pole. \n", "test2_true": "SIGFRIED Please, don't leave me. I'll call you Ted from now on. \nTED It's not me, mister, I swear. \nSIGFRIED Personally, I don't give a fuck, Ted, it's just I don't want to be alone right now. I'm feeling a little vulnerable. \nSigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder, grabs a half-empty bottle of Jack Daniel's, and passes it to Ted, who takes a hit. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) No guns, okay? Just you and me, Ted. You know my father used to say that forgiveness is the only thing that evil can't sink its teeth into. \nTED That's beautiful. \nSIGFRIED Kind of nice down here on the floor, isn't it, Ted? \nTED Yes, actually. \nSIGFRIED Things take on a whole new perspective... You'd like my trust, wouldn't you, Ted? \nTED Yes I would. \nSIGFRIED I just got one thing to ask you and I'll let you go. \nTED Okay. Okay. \nSIGFRIED Tell me straight now. \nTED What? \nSIGFRIED What was it like? \nTED What was what like? \nSIGFRIED You know, you and her. \nTED Oh, for fuck sake, Sigfried, what do you want me to say? \nSIGFRIED Either way you're fucked, right? You ever gonna see her again, Theodore? \nTED If I ever saw her again, I'd run the other way. \nSIGFRIED Promise? \nTED I promise. \nSigfried releases Ted and stands up. \nSIGFRIED You're lying, but I can respect that, Ted. If you told me, it would no longer be a secret, and secrets have a power, kid. You open that box and they disappear forever. A bad secret will rip you apart, but the good one are all you got. In the end, when all the people you knew are dead and gone, all you'll have left are you secrets. And when you die, the box is open and it all blows away -- dust to dust -- all the anger, jealousy, desire and love just blow away. \nSigfried throws his hand out to help Ted up. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) So you know what I say, let's call it a truce, kiddo. \nSigfried takes Ted by the hand and leads him to an open window. Ted is overcome by the sweetness in Sigfried's voice and follows him to the window willingly. \nThe two men look out into the dark Los Angeles night. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) I'm a man of love, Theodore. Love is all I live for. \nTED I can see that. \nSIGFRIED Maybe to a fault. \nTED Don't beat yourself up over it. \nSIGFRIED That's nice of you to say, Ted, but I probably should make a clean break of it, cut her loose and get my own place. I just can't imagine living without her. Do you think I should seek professional help? \nTED It's not for everyone, but maybe in your case it could help. \nSIGFRIED You ever been out on the ocean at night? \nTed shakes his head. \nSIGFRIED (continuing) I have... scary as a motherfucker, all that darkness around you. It's like a big black carpet rolled out as far as the eye can see. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll see a light. It could be as small as a little spark, but it will cut a path straight through all that blackness, straight to you. It could be another boat, or some distant fire on an island, but that light will shed a shining path of diamonds cutting through mile after mile of darkness to lie at your feet. That's love, Ted, it's like a path of light in an ocean of darkness. \nTed and Sigfried stare out of the window in peace, transfixed by the glimmering lights of the city. A loud SHOT rings out, shattering the still moment. The two men spin around. Angela stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side. \nSigfried drops to his knees. Ted checks him out, no blood. Angela has fired the gun into the floor below. Ted looks up at Angela. Angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands the bullets to Ted. \nANGELA (to Ted) You'd better go check to see if I killed anybody downstairs. \nSigfried is bent over, silently weeping on the floor. \n", "test2_id": 3214, "test3_input": "MAN Okay? \nHe blows one kiss. One for both of them. \nAs Man and his Wife walk out the door, Man turns back to the children... \nMAN Don't misbehave. \nHe closes the door. \nSarah stands in the middle of the room. She's looking at the door Man and Wife just disappeared through. Stunned. \nHer dress looks frilly and beautifully uncomfortable. She touches the edges of the fabric. \nSARAH Why did we have to get all dressed up if we weren't going with them? \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY \nMan and Wife are walking down the hall. \nMan stops in his tracks. Wife stops too and looks at Man. They wait. \nCUT TO: \nROOM 716 \nJuancho shuts off the television. He drops the remote to the floor. His attention is on the fireworks outside. He leaps to the window and begins unlatching it. \nSARAH What are you doing? \nJUANCHO Escaping. Stinks in here, anyway. \nMan bursts through the door of the hotel room and stands in the doorway, glaring at the mischievous Juancho. \nJuancho bangs his head on the window trying to get back inside. He leaps to the floor and tries to turn on the TV with the remote. \nMAN (stern) What did I say? \nJuancho turns to Man as if he'd been sitting there watching television the whole time. \nMAN Behave. \nJUANCHO Yes, Papa. \nTed appears at the door with Man's champagne. \nTED The champagne you ordered, sir. \nMAN No time for this. Leave it on ice. \nTed proceeds to place the champagne in the room. \nWIFE But I want some now... \nTed is torn. Man pushes him into the room. \nMAN There'll be plenty for you and the party, baby, you can bomb yourself all you want at the party. \nWIFE What a waste. \nTed places the bucket near the bed. After setting up the bottle, he turns to leave, but now Man closes the door, trapping Ted inside with them. \nMAN (to Ted) Hey. \nTed looks around, bewildered. Now what? \nMan is reaching into his coat pocket. \nMAN You want five hundred bucks? \nTED Sure! \nMan hesitates a moment, then pulls out his wallet. That was too easy. \nMAN How about three? \nTED Three hundred? \nMAN Yeah. \n", "test3_true": "MAN My children are staying here tonight watching TV. I want you to check up on them every thirty minutes. \nTED Check up on 'em? \nMAN Make sure they're all right, make sure they're fed, make sure they go to bed. \nTED We can call out and hire a babysitter. \nMAN I don't trust babysitters. My children are safer alone than with some fucked- up pedophile babysitter I don't know from the man in the fucking moon. \nWIFE What about him? What makes you think you can trust him? \nMan grabs Ted's face and tilts it torward Wife. \nMAN Tell me that's not a face you can trust. \nMan lets go of Ted's face. He feels his jaw. It's still there. \nTED Look, sir, I'd like to help you out, but I really can't. I'm all alone here tonight. \nMan whips out his wallet and counts out money in Ted's face. \nMAN One hundred... two hundred... three hundred... \nTED I thought you said five hundred. \nMan glares at Ted. \nMAN I said three hundred. \nTed doesn't back down. \nTED No, you distinctly said five hundred. \nThe angrier Man gets, the quieter he talks. \nMAN You calling me a liar? \nTed, while not backing down, massages the situation. \nTED No, I'm not saying you're lying. I'm saying you accidentally forgot that what you first said was five hundred. \nMan has never been challenged like this by a fuckin' bellboy. \nMAN I don't do anything accidentally, jerk. I might've first said five hundred, but what I last said was three hundred, and what you say last is what counts. \nTed not only doesn't back down, but psychologically pokes his finger in the scary Man's chest. \nTED Well then, if you say five hundred one last time, we got a deal. \nMan's eyes narrow. He physically pokes his finger in Ted's chest. \nMAN You fuckin' with me, Pendejo? \nNow Ted takes a step backwards. \nTED No, not at all. It's New Year's Eve and I'm here alone. If there was somebody else here, no problem, but I'm by myself. And looking after your kids is a pain in the ass I don't need -- \nMAN You callin' my kids a pain in the ass? \nTED -- No, they're not a pain in the ass, it's the situation that's a pain in the ass. \nMan drops the tenseness. \nMAN No, you were right the first time. You win, tough guy, five hundred. \nMan respects Ted for not backing down, but not insulting him either. A skill Man never learned. Wife shoots a look at the children. \nWIFE (disgusted) You kids are getting expensive. \nJuancho turns back to the TV. \nSarah stares down Wife. \nMAN (looking at name tag) What's your name? Ted? \nCLOSE-UP of name tag. \nTED Yeah. It's Ted. \nMan tears off Ted's name tag and throws it to children. \n", "test3_id": 3215}

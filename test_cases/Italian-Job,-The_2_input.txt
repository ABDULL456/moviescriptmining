Lyle's coasting down Exposition Boulevard towards Union Station. Clear sailing for him. 
He sees a young woman thumbing for a ride. It's Karen. And he recognizes her: she was hitchhiking when he first arrived in L.A. He pulls over. To Lyle, she might be an angel in the empyrean if she wasn't, so completely, a woman. 
LYLE Where are you going? 
KAREN Away. 
LYLE How about far, far away? 
KAREN The farther the better. 
EXT. FIGUEROA & OLYMPIC - DAY 
Charlie's still having a helluva time getting rid of the motorcycle. It screams like a Banshee as it streaks up alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed right at him. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI 
He jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street, driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel Figueroa. 
With the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers 
(it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.) 
Suddenly the LAPD helicopter swoops down towards the parking lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the Mini. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI 
He's got no place else to go... 
INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA 
The Mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted palm trees. 
The motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The elevator door opens. Some tourists step off. 
CHARLIE Going up? 
INT. ELEVATOR 
The Mini darts right in, not an inch to spare. Charlie reaches out the window, presses the button for ROOF. 
He sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer. 
The door closes just in time. 
A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people screaming at the sight of the guns. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY 
The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins. 
LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow strip. Each tower has its own elevator. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI 
He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even the Mini couldn't squeeze through. 
In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not about to abandon ship. 
EXT. ROOFTOP 
So he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the first tower and in -- 
EYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS 
His car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a football... 
NEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP 
The Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled, looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING. 
And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it forward -- 
I/E CHARLIE'S MINI 
He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to the last elevator, skids to a stop. 
He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his shoulder to witness -- 
THE MOTORCYCLE 
going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop jump.

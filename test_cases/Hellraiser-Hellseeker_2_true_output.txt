LANGE For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally. 
TREVOR It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control. 
LANGE I did read that, yes. (flipping through the report) What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General. 
Trevor looks numb, unable to answer.    Lange poker faced, keeps looking through the reoport. 
LANGE (CON'T) (cont'd) Listen we really are at a stalemate here until we find the body itself. Is there any way you did not tell missing persons everything that happened just before that accident? 
TREVOR Why wouldn't I tell you everything? (impatiently) Look, I've been fully cooperative... (quick to add) ... to my recollection. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LANGE I'm sorry Mr. Gooding, I meant no disrespect. I'm just doing my job here, OK? I mean between your head injury and the fact that you are on very strong pain medication, you might not be remembering a few details about the crash which might help us here. 
Lange takes a deep hit of the nasal spray. 
LANGE (cont'd) What you're recalling could be a fabrication you've made up about it. Do you follow? 
CLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE as he wrestles with this notion. 
FLASH BACK: 
INT. TREVOR'S CAR - DAY 
Kirsty's eyes are closed. She is motionless. Trevor tries to look at her while watching the road at the same time. 
TREVOR Kirsty. Jesus, wake up! 
This time she doesn't wake up. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
The car fishtails. Trevor loses control and the car skids from one side of the bridge to the other- careening toward the guardrail- SMASH! 
The car is plummeting toward the river below... The car hits the surface... 
INT. UNDERWATER - DAY 
Trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He swims up to the passenger door and tries the handle. It won't give. Unable to breathe Trevor finally swims up... 
EXT. SHORE - DAY 
He breaks the surface and crawls onto the shore... 
He looks out at the car to where she should be trapped inside... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Trevors eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, The car is sinking fast... 
He looks at the car and calls out, but there is no Kristy insight. 
The car disappears under the surface... 
Trevor hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of the bashed-up guardrail is sailing right down toward him- 
TREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM 
INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY 
LANGE Mr. Gooding? You still in there? 
Trevor blinks and looks around him. Lange is sitting just where they were when he saw him last. Only now there's a very wary look on his face. Whoa. 
TREVOR Uhh. Yes detective, sorry. Just trying to recollect, you know? 
Lange nods. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Okay. From what I remember now, maybe my wife was thrown from the car when it hit the water. Maybe she wasn't trapped inside.

His hair growing back nicely, The Postman has reached the proverbial fork in the road. He considers his two options: "Pine View -- 32 miles." Or "Ridgemont -- 220 miles." He looks the two roads over, thinks. 
THE POSTMAN Well, that's easy. 
29   EXT. GATES (PINE VIEW, OREGON) - DUSK                           29 
The town is protected by a tall, long palisade.     Like Ft. Apache. All is dark as The Postman approaches. 
THE POSTMAN Greetings, Pine View, Oregon! 
TWO SENTRIES appears from the gate house.    They aim arrows. 
SENTRY #1 Just head back the way you came. Pine View ain't buying, ain't listening and don't give charity. 
A moment of truth is here.    Finally, with authority: 
THE POSTMAN Civilian, I'm on official business. I demand entry into the town of Pine View. 
SENTRY #2 What the hell are you talking about? 
THE POSTMAN I'm through talking to you, buddy boy! Now get somebody with authority to open this gate! 
More silhouettes appear on the palisade.     One is SHERIFF BRISCOE, a big, no-nonsense man. 
BRISCOE I'm Sheriff Briscoe. Who the hell are you? 
THE POSTMAN I'm a representative of the United States Government -- 
An uproar.    He makes himself heard above it. 
(CONTINUED) 
29   CONTINUED:                                                      29 
THE POSTMAN Authorized by order 417 of the restored Congress to reestablish a communication route to Idaho and lower Oregon. Now open that damn gate! 
BRISCOE What does that mean in English? 
THE POSTMAN I'm your postman! 
There's a silent hush. 
BRISCOE (to someone on wall) Hand me your gun. 
THE POSTMAN Understand that tampering with or obstructing the mail is a federal offense. Furthermore, the Bolin Act requires you to provide all mail carriers with sanctuary and nourishment. (starting forward) Now open that damn gate! 
BRISCOE You got three seconds to get your ass outta here. 
THE POSTMAN Is Jerry the contractor here? 
Briscoe pumps his shotgun, aims it at The Postman. 
THE POSTMAN Wait! I'm going to get something out of my bag. 
The Postman dumps the pack over, frantically shuffles through the letters. 
BRISCOE One! 
THE POSTMAN Paul Davis!   124 Vernon Street! 
BRISCOE Never heard of him. Two! 
(CONTINUED) 
29   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                29 
THE POSTMAN Lois Kent!   14 Weymoth Lane! 
BRISCOE Three! 
He fumbles for the last letter.       Briscoe takes aim. 
THE POSTMAN Irene March!   478 River Road! 
There's an absolute stunned silence.      Like a switch was thrown. 
30   EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY                                          30 
The crowd parts as everyone turns to look back at IRENE MARCH. Mrs. March, in her late 50s, is blind, her eyes clouded by cataracts. In disbelief... 
MRS. MARCH Did he say my name? 
The sense of hope is palpable as the gates are swung back. Two TOWNIES hurry Mrs. March out to meet The Postman. They're followed by a throng. As he sees she's blind... 
THE POSTMAN Oh, no... 
Too late now. They stop Mrs. March in front of him.        She stares off just to his left, a little afraid. 
MRS. MARCH I'm Irene March. 
THE POSTMAN (uncomfortable) I have a letter for you. 
He presses it into her hands, but she won't take it. 
MRS. MARCH Would you read it? 
THE POSTMAN I'm sure it's personal. 
MRS. MARCH Please.   Someone has to. 
(CONTINUED) 
30   CONTINUED:                                                         30 
The Postman has little choice.     As he opens the envelope... 
THE POSTMAN We're delivering the old stock piles, but I'll accept all new correspondence as well. 
TOWNIE Just read it, will ya?

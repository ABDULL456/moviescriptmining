PRICK STREETS OF MICHIGAN CITY, INDIANA - A BROWN \nPONTIAC is parked at the curb. It waits. \nINT. PONTIAC - \"RED\" HAMILTON ( 34) \nlooks at his watch. With his meticulously parted red hair, he might be a bank president. It's 6:55 a.m. \nHAMILTON Time. Thirty year old JOHN HERBERT DILLINGER is in the backseat. He nods. His arms are behind him. We don't know why. Red starts the car and drives forward. \nCUT TO: \nINT. INDIANA STATE PRISON, MICHIGAN CITY, INDIANA - LINE OF \nCONVICTS Its cold.-Convicts' uniforms are broadly striped and frayed. This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn hair, broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity. And their aggression has a nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender. There's nothing beaten down about these men. Like Alcatraz, Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is the end of the line. \nPRISON GUARDS in visored black caps, black shirts, black patent leather Sam Browne belts with three-foot long billy clubs watch the line, poised to unleash violence. \nAMONG THE HARD MEN ARE... HARRY \"PETE\" PIERPONT (32), 6 foot 1 with eerie blue eyes. Brilliant, violent, he hates all authority. CHARLES MAKLEY ( 44), squat with an anvil jaw, facial scars and as calm as Pierpont is volatile. HOMER VAN METER (27), tall, an incorrigible clown and an unemotional killer. He has continued to ridicule guards even when it cost him months in the hole. \nTHESE THREE with an older man, WALTER DIETRICH, wait for the lam. work call to the prison Shirt Factory... \nINT. INDIANA STATE PRISON, GATEHOUSE - TURNKEY \nwatches through a window as a Pontiac pulls into the parking area in front of the prison across from the streetcar tracks. Hamilton jerks a handcuffed Dillinger out of the backseat. Dillinger is shoved forward. Hamilton's wearing a star. \nTURNKEY (opening up) Afternoon. Hamilton flashes the badge. He shoves Dillinger inside. In an adjacent room FIVE GUARDS play poker. Next to them is a barred entrance to the prison yard. As the cage door locks behind him, this is the last place Dillinger wants to have entered. Meanwhile... \nINT. INDIANA STATE PRISON - THE SHIRT FACTORY: STACKS OF \nBOXES and bolts of fabric wait for the convicts. lam. A KLAXON sounds. Door opens. Convicts enter. Walter Dietrich goes right to the stacks and pulls a box with an \"X\" crayoned on the side. Its labeled \"Thread.\" (Dietrich was mentored by Herbert K. Lamm, an ex-Prussian soldier who invented professional bank robbery by applying military tactics and who rode with Butch & Sundanc4's Hole in the Wall Gang in Utah in 1901. in prison Dietrich passed on Lamm's techniques. His brightest student in 1933 is..'ohn Herbert Dillinger.) \nDIETRICH + \"THREAD\" BOX arrive at a busy work station with Pierpont, Makley and Van Meter. Under spools are four Colt 45 automatics with loaded magazines. \nGUARD DAINARD is approached by Pierpont, who shoves the 45 in his face. \nPIERPONT Line up! Line up... Dietrich and Van Meter control THREE OTHER GUARDS. ED SHOUSE, JIM LESLIE and EARL ADAMS - three other Cons armed with makeshift clubs and spivs -- join the escape. Meanwhile... \nINT. GATEHOUSE - TURNKEY \nexamines Dillinger a second time... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTURNKEY Didn't you get paroled out of here a few months ago? \nDILLINGER Yes, sir. Three months ago. \nTURNKEY . John... Johnnie Dillinger? \nDILLINGER That's right. But my friends call me \"Johnnie\". You gotta address me as \"Mister\" Dillinger. Dillinger's insubordination puzzles Turnkey so he doesn't see Hamilton bat a Thompson submachine gun across the back of his head and swing it onto the Two Guards... \nRED/DILLINGER Against the wall! Hands up! Get up! Dillinger's cuffs fell away. Now his Thompson covers the stunned poker\u00c2\u00b0players. Hamilton and Dillinger are as tight as they come.- They share their food, money, liquor, ammunition and women. ,.id right now... \nYARD GATE is keyed open by Dainard followed by Pierpont and Makley and the others. Pierpont kicks over the poker table. Escapees throw all the Guards against the wall. \nMAKLEY/VAN METER (to the Guards) Undress. Get undressed! \nDILLINGER at the window checks the escape route to the Pontiac. Its clear. Hamilton conceals his weapon and starts out. Smooth. He crosses the front lawn, the street car tracks. So far, so good... \nINT. GATE HOUSE - GUARDS \nundress. One takes his time. \nSHOUSE Hurry up! C'mon! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: This Guard gives Shouse an insolent look. Shouse slams the Guard's head with a length of steel pipe. Guard goes down. Shouse goes wild and continues to hammer his skull again and again, caving it in. \nPIERPONT Cut it out Shouse! \nDILLINGER (turns from open door) Shouse!I Dainard thinks that once the killing's begun, he will die... So, he grabs for Homer Van Meter's .45. Van Meter SHOOTS Dainard. Dainard's knocked to the floor. Blood pools. A SIREN SCREAMS. \nEXT. FRONT YARD - RED \ncaught in the open, turns. He scans the guard towers on the East and West corners. He backs towards his Pontiac. RED'S POV: TOWER GUARDS look into the prison interior where the shots came from. \nDILLINGER arrives, takes Red's position. Red goes for the Pon,.c... \nHAMILTON Kid didn't fool with anything, did he? Dillinger, looking back at the boy, hasn't heard. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHAMILTON (CONT'D) Johnnie? All there? Dillinger lifts the coats on the backseat: their weapons are as they were. \nDILLINGER Its all here. \n(UPBEAT) Let's go make some money. The speeding cars throw up tails of dust as they drive west to Chicago. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THICK WOODS NEAR EAST LIVERPOOL, OHIO - A MAN - DAY \nmoves quickly through the woods. They run downhill. He wears expensive hunting clothes. He carries an 8mm Mauser sports rifle with a slim forestock and wrist and a turned-down bolt handle. It's the best rifle made in 1933. \nHE IS MELVIN PURVIS (30) cleancut and handsome. A square jaw. Chester Gould modelled Dick Tracy's profile after Purvis. Has not big, but he's tenacious. He's an incarnation of the social elite of h.is time: white, Southern patrician and a Christian gentleman. With Purvis are Special Agents WARREN BARTON (31) and Purvis's friend CARTER DAUM (29) They have a harder time in the steep woods. They're chasing someone. They are guided by East Liverpool police chief, \nFULTZ. \nBOTTOM OF THE HILL -- PRETTY BOY FLOYD ( 29) is a big-boned country boy. His blue suit is mud-streaked from his slide down the hill. He carries a Thompson submachine-gun with a drum magazine, and he is running for his life. \nPURV I S , FULTZ, BAUM + BARTON race after him. \nMUDDY PATH - FLOYD half runs, half slips in his dress shoes.

Floyd's three hundred yards ahead. He zigzags for a deeper forest at the far end. If he can reach it, he has a chance. \nPURVIS breaks into the clear. \nPURVIS Floyd! Halt! Purvis aims the Mauser. Perfect form. Floyd zigzags. Purvis FIRES, misses. Floyd opens up with the Thompson -- wildly at that range. A few .45s splinter nearby branches. Fultz, Baum and Barton seek cover: Purvis works the bolt and chambers another round. Floyd is 10 yards from the forest. Purvis kneels onto his right knee. On his upraised left knee he braces hi left elbow. He inhales. Starts a smooth squeeze. Ha Tway through the exhale he FIRES. Floyd's right arm flies up. He's punched forward and crashes to the ground. \nFLOYD regains consciousness. Purvis is running in. Floyd`s left hand pulls a 45. \nBAUM Look out, Melvin! Purvis kicks the 45 out of his hand. \nPURVIS You are under arrest. Floyd sits up to see the massive exit wound. His right lung and liver are shot through. He falls back. \nFLOYD \n(RASPS) I'm Floyd. Who are you? \nPURVIS Melvin Purvis - Department of Investigation. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPURVIS (CONT'D) \n(BEAT) Where's your friend Harry Campbell, Floyd? \nFLOYD Ain't gonna tell you shit. Floyd looks at the sky. \nFLOYD (CONT'D) And I believe you have killed me. So you can go and rot in hell, you sonofabitch. He lapses, goes cold and dies. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - CA-ROLE SLAYMAN - DAY (EAST CHICAGO, INDIANA) \nCAROLE SLAYMAN is 33 with green eyes and peroxide blonde hair and bounces down the stairs in a black robe.

He half picks her up with one arm around her waist. \n(CONTINUED) \nMCKELLAR With no field experience. For once Hoover is silent. \nMCKELLAR (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) In fact you are shockingly unqualified, aren't you, sir? You have never personally conducted a criminal investigation in the field in your life= Others in the room stare at Hoover. McKellar leans'-back... \nMCKELLAR (CONT \u00c2\u00b0 D ) \n(CONTINUING) I think you are a front. I think your prowess as a lawman is a myth created from a hoopla of headlines by Mr. Suydam, your publicist there. You are trying to make a federal police force with you set up as its Czar. That is runnin' wild in my estimation... \nHOOVER Crime is what runs wild in this country, Mr. Chairman. And... \nMCKELLAR And if the country required an expanded Bureau, I question you are the person most fit to run it while... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nHOOVER \n(EXPLODES) I won't be judged by a kangaroo court of venal politicians... \nMCKELLAR (slams gavel!)

EDGAR HOOVER -DAY walks fast through the corridor of congressmen. He talks over his left shoulder to Suydam and Tolson. They struggle to hear him... \nHOOVER (to Suydam) Find out: was he soft on the Reds in ,1919? Does he use prostitutes? Peppy `tuf f like that. And feed this to Walter =!rii\u00e2\u0080\u009einchell: \"McKellar's a Neanderthal. He's O7:a personal vendetta to destroy me.\" Like that. \n(BEAT) We'll fight him on the front page.

Beat it! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Three hostages jump off. Dillinger pulls Anna Patzke and Weyland inside. \nDILLINGER sees Anna Patzke's shivering from shock and the cold. He puts his coat on her.

Pierpont binds them loosely to the tree. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWEYLAND We'll freeze. \nDILLINGER You'll worm your way out of that in about ten minutes. Anna looks over at Dellinger. \nDILLINGER (CONT'D) It's okay, doll. You're just gonna be a little late for dinner. Dillinger reaches over, snatches his hat off Anna Patzke's head. He leaves her his coat. \nTHE BUICK WORK CAR is abandoned. \nTRACK RIGHT + SEE Dillinger''b Essex and a Ford drive off past fields with snow on both sides. New cars. Flush with cash.

Therefore, he may have been harbored or have a safe house nearby. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nDILLINGER Homer stayin' steady? \nHAMILTON (reading his mind) He's okay. \nDILLINGER Three rules I learned from Walter Dietrich. One: never work with people who are desperate. Two: never work with people who aren't the best. Three: never work when you're not ready. Billie reappears, dancing with a young man. \nHAMILTON Well, I got rule four: stay away from women. \nDILLINGER Without women, I might as well have `stayed in stir. Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red. \nHAMILTON What's why they invented whores. (getting up) Hamilton leaves, arms around the women. Dillinger keeps his eye on Billie. Music ends. Young man escorts her to her table. He tries to join her. She turns him down. Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches. He now sees how beautiful Billie is. She's 5 foot 5. With a straight erect build, she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger straight in the eye. Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing about the edges. He unexpectedly starts to feel nervous. He gives her his best grin. \nDILLINGER I don't know what you said to your friend, but I sure am glad you did. Billie looks him over: a well-made man in a good suit with a great smile. And, paradoxes: he easily talks to women but he's not a hustler. He's young, but there's a world of experience in his face. Open, but he's holding something back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ( 4) \nDILLINGER (CONT'D) What's your name? \nBILLIE Billie Frechette. \nDILLINGER Buy you a drink? Billie looks at her girlfriend, she nods, Billie rises... As they cross to the bar. \nDILLINGER (CONT'B) Is that French? \nBILLIE On my father's side. There's an \"e\" at the end. Do you have a name? \nDILLINGER Jack Harris. Music changes to \"Bye Bye Blackbird.\" \nBILLIE Do you dance, Jack? \nDILLINGER I don't know how. She smiles a pretty smile at him. \nBILLIE How come you don't know how to dance? Its easy. Follow me. This is a two-step. (he stares at her feet) Don't look at my feet. Look at my shoulders. She stays an inch or two distant in his arms. Its slow and languorous. He follows her with little difficulty.

He pulls her closer, wants to kiss her long smooth neck. He almost can't resist... Their lips are an inch apart. And then she rests her cheek on his shoulder and the kiss that wasn't hangs in the air around them. He whispers... \nDILLINGER. (CONT'D) Where you from, Billie? She turns her right ear towards him. She's deaf in her left ear. \nBILLIE Flandreau. \nDILLINGER Where's Flandreau.? \nTORCH SINGER \n(SINGS) \"Where somebody waits for me Sugar's sweet, so is she Bye, bye blackbird...\" \nBILLIE outh Dakota. \nDILLINGER Father's French, what's on the other side? \nBILLIE Italian. \nDILLINGER From South Dakota, Indian's likelier than Italian.

(her hair) Dark, beautiful, like the black bird in that song... She laughs at the flattery. Holds his eyes a beat with an ironic look. A couple from another group looks at Dillinger. He's cool. He returns the look. They look away. \nDILLINGER (CONT`D) Say, how'd you like some dinner? \nBILLIE Sure. He nods courteously to her girlfriends, grabs her coat, puts a hand around Billie's waist and steers her out... \nTORCH SINGER \n(SINGS) \"So make my bed and light the light Cause I'll be home late tonight Bye, bye blackbird... .\" \nEXT.

Berman supplies cars to the syndicate. Since Capone. Dillinger must have been at Berman's switching cars when he bought that coat. \n(BEAT) Soon as they call to switch out the next car, we will tail them. Right to Dillinger. \nEXT.

May flashes Billie a look: if you don't want him, I do. \nMAY MINCZELES Sounds good to me. Dillinger has eyes only for Billie. \nDILLINGER You ran out on me. \nBILLIE `you left me standing alone on the sidewalk. \nDILLINGER I 'you're going to be my girl, you have swear you'll never do that again. \nBILLIE I'm not your girl!

And that's a promise. \nCUSTOMER Well, I want to run out of here. So, lady, will you get my coat...? Dillinger lifts the man two feet off the floor and slams him into the wall. Real jailhouse rage. The lethally cold eyes tells the customer everything he needs to know. Dillinger swings him to the counter, grabs the man's ticket, slams thru the half door, finds the man's coat, tosses it at him... \nDILLINGER Keep the tip.

She doesn't move. \nBILLIE No one's ever done that for me before. \nDILLINGER You're with me now. \nBILLIE I don't know anything about you. \nDILLINGER I was raised on a farm in Mooresville, Indiana. My ma died when I was three. My daddy beat the hell out of me because he didn't know no better way to raise me. I used to do dumb things but I'm a lot smarter now.

He sits her down on a sofa. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He goes into a closet to get two Marshall Fields boxes and two drinks. \nBILLIE You been living here long? \nDILLINGER Yeah. Since yesterday. From a back bedroom (Red's) a phonograph is louder as a door opens and Red enters the kitchen in a robe for a drink. He returns. Laughter. Dillinger has the boxes and drinks. \nDILLINGER (CONT'D) I got something for you. \n(BEAT) What's wrong? Open it up. Billie opens the boxes. She lifts out a sleeveless dress in dusty pink.

Billie is wearing a straw hat. They are shouting to the greyhounds along with Pierpont, Homer and Makley and some girls. They have tall drinks. This is the good life for the privileged few in the middle of the Depression. A dog wins; not theirs. It calms down... \nDILLINGER (to Pierpont; business) Well drive out separately. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ( 2) \nDILLINGER (CONT'D) Billie and I want to hit the Gulf Coast on the way to Arizona. \nPIERPONT I want to take 66 and check banks in Denver and Phoenix.

I never thought I'd see Florida. \nDILLINGER You going somewhere, doll, am I? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBILLIE It's been, three, four weeks. You'll look for a change. Or you'll get tired of me. And then I'll be sad and angry. So I wanted to say thank you before then... Dillinger is surprised that her expectations are so low. She didn't think his interest in her to be more than passing. \nDILLINGER You want to leave? \nBILLIE No. But I'm no fool. I'll be back checking coats at the Steuben Club. \nDILLINGER Well, I don't want you to leave. So it won't be that way. \nBILLIE Then it will be another way that's worse. \n(BEAT) You rob banks and you run rings around them, but you're likely to get killed or, get shot and... \nDILLINGER Who the hell gave you a crystal ball?! \nWILLIE Well, goddamn it, you don't need a crystal ball...!

We were supposed to meet...at our apartment... \nREINECKE Where? \nBILLIE On Addison. 1148... \nCU: DILLINGER Here, in the belly of the beast. The lopsided grin behind the dark glasses over the moustache... \nDILLINGER How long will you be? \nPOLLY It might take ten minutes. \nDILLINGER I'll meet you back here... He waits as she boards an elevator. As her doors close, Dillinger follows a group of police, bail bondsmen, and civilian workers into a second elevator. \nINT. SIXTH FLOOR, LOBBY - ON DILLINGER \nentering the \"Detective Bureau\" and we MOVE with him past desks and detectives in the open plan office. He walks with cocky assurance. Now he turns down an aisle between desks because he's spotted on one of the glass dividers a sign that exerts a magnetic pull on him. It designates the elite... \n\"DILLINGER SQUAD\" \nJOHN DILLINGER \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: heads right for it. \nECU DILLINGER'S HAND brushes under his jacket his .45, checking.. \nWIDE - JOHNNY enters this section of desks. Shafts of light illuminate papers. A DETECTIVE we may have seen at Midway Airport right past him... Wall charts, crime photos from Crown Point, the American Bank, other banks, Billie, mug shots of all his crew, are posted on walls. Photos of Dillinger are on desks. It's as if it was a shrine to him. \nIN A CORNER SIX OR SEVEN DETECTIVES listen to the ninth inning of a White Sox game. Three others work through reports in shirt sleeves. One glances his way. Johnny nods. Detective nods back. \nJOHNNY crosses thr4gh it all, strolls in the lion's den, walks in the belly ;ofthe beast - among the hunters. His audacity elevates h-,It is triumph. With all their resources, modern technology\".`and organization, they cannot lay a glove on him. He is better than they are. His gratification is internal. He leaves behind, as he exits, a wake of absurdity. He passed through and they didn't even know. History was made. Like a ghost, has gone. \nEXT.

PURVIS OFFICE - WIDE: BRIEFING - SUNDAY LATE AFTERNOON \nWe SEE the East Chicago cops and the ex-Texas Rangers Winstead, Campbell and Hurt. Twenty other agents are in the small office. 110 degrees outside. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPURVIS Is it the Marbro or the Biograph? We will be deployed at both. Whichever one he shows at, I will be outside that theater when Dillinger exits.

That's how we're gonna know it's him. \nWINSTEAD What's playin'? \nPURVIS Excuse me? \nWINSTEAD What's playin' at the Marbro? What's playin' at the Biograph? It hadn't occurred to anybody to find that out. \nMANDALA (from newspaper) Marbro...a Shirley Temple movie called \"Moptop.\" Biograph is playing a gangster-, picture starring Clark Gable. \"Manhattan::: Melodrama.\" \nWINSTEAD John Dillinger ain't going to a Shirley Temple movie. \nPURVIS Sergeant Zarkovich and Special Agent Winstead will be at the Biograph.

Does he remember the words of Billie about what Dillinger would do to him? \nCU: PURVIS watches the crowds thin as showtime nears. He gets out of the car. Is Dillinger a no-show? Another failure? Another eviscerating memo from Hoover? THREE FIGURES BRUSH PAST HIM. A woman's orange skirt. Its Anna Sage, Polly Hamilton, and John Dillinger. They sweep to the ticket booth, pay, and join latecomers rushing inside so that they don't miss the start of the movie. \nPURVIS is stunned. Dillinger passed three feet from him. \nCHICAGO P.D.

There's no more point to it. \nCU: DILLINGER He sees inwards. And he knows it won't happen. Them=E no Mexico with Billie. There's no freighter to Manila.- He will die. This day, this month, next month. He knows that in this instant. \nJOHN DILLINGER. LOOKING UP AT THE SCREEN. In this Hollywood version of life, the power of cause and effect operates on the end, as inescapably as gravity. It's a core truth. This is the only end for Blackie Gallagher. And its as true for john Dillinger in his life as it is for Gallagher. Actions and historical forces have made his time be up. Dillinger SLOWS the flickering images. His concentration slices time into component parts. Gable exchanges last good- byes. He warns his D.A. friend, Ronald Coleman, not to commute his sentence. The images play on Dillinger's face. They take him over-alone in the packed theater while 25 Federal Agents and five East Chicago cops wait outside. \nBLACKIE GALLAGHER \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) enters the execution chamber. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

She doesn't want to miss Dillinger if he leaves. A celiblock. The cellblock lights dim, a convict says... \nDILLINGER .tell Billie... Only Charles Winstead hears the rest. \nPURVIS unloads Dillinger's gun. His gun-handling of Dillinger's gun is a lot better than his gun-handling of his own under stress. \nPURVIS What did he say? \nWINSTEAD I couldn't hear him. \nPURVIS You look after this. I need to call Washington. Zarkovich`houlders through the gathering crowd of \nPEDESTRIAN s=and newsmen, sees the head wound, the glazing over of Diflinger's eyes. He knows he's safe. \nJOHN DILLINGER'S EYES get dreamy, then they seem to focus far away. Then they seem to focus not at all. \nPURVIS (CONT'D) Cover his face and keep the damn photographers away. \nAERIAL: LINCOLN AVENUE Purvis starts away and we SEE the Biograph marquee, the trolley tracks in the cobblestone street, the alley, and the hundreds of people moving towards the locus of the dead John Dillinger. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

And while crossing the street, Alvin slows down. \nTHE MAN IS CHARLES WINSTEAD The newspaper hides a sawn-off, 10 gauge Winchester lever action shotgun. \nALVIN LOOKS TO HIS LEFT: CLARENCE HURT leans on a lamp post. His body hides a 351 Winchester rifle. \nNOW ALVIN KARPIS freezes. He doesn't hesitate. He opens his hands to demonstrate he is holding nothing and lets his jacket; fall to the ground. He knows instantly who they are and that.,,they intend to kill him. Karpis' eyes dart to the roofto is\u00c2\u00b0. Snipers on both. In this instant, Karpis knows he is done. One objective races into his mind: stay alive. \nKARPIS' stretches out his arms, wide. Winstead has dropped the newspaper. The sawed-off 10 gauge is aimed squarely at Alvin's chest. Karpis is displaying he is unarmed. Winstead approaches warily step-by-step. His weapon would cut Alvin in half. Clarence, the rifle at his shoulder, inches forward. The ex-Texas Ranger gunfighters with real trigger-time have taken Alvin Karpis. \nALVIN KARPIS I am unarmed. \nWINSTEAD Don't even breathe sudden. \nWINSTEAD \u00c2\u00b1 CAMPBELL + HURT are 10 feet from him.

EQUIVALENTS: 
Nachtner continues in voice-over: 
Seven digits-a phone number maybe? Sussman reaches for the phone. He hesitates a moment, then dials. . Sussman dials. It rings. 
AN ELEVATED CUBICLE In a grocery store. A man in short sleeves reaches for the phone. Rabbi Nachtner It's a Red Owl grocery store in Bloomington. Hello? Do you know a goy named Kraus? Russel Kraus? The store manager is shaking his head. Where have I called? The Red Owl. In Bloomington. Thanks so much. The manager, puzzled, hangs up. Sussman thinks, am I supposed to go to the Red Owl, to receive a further sign? He goes... In the parking lot of the Red Owl Sussman, wearing a short-brimmed fedora, emerges from his car. It is an unremarkable grocery store in a suburban mall. It's a Red Owl. Inside Sussman, in his fedora, gazes around. Groceries. What have you. A service alley behind the store: dumpsters, wind-blown garbage, Sussman looking. On the wall behind the store, a stain... There is an old, rather nondescript stain of some liquid splatted against the back wall and long since dribbled away. . Could be a nun sofit... Or maybe not... The parking lot again: Sussman gets back in his car. 
Sussman goes home. What does it mean? He has to find out, if he's ever to sleep again. Sussman again, in pyjamas buttoned to the neck, lies in his bed staring at the ceiling. He goes to see the Rabbi, Nachtner. He comes in and sits right where you're sitting now. Sussman is indeed sitting across from Rabbi Nachtner, just where we've seen LARRY sitting. What does it mean, Rabbi? Is it a sign from Hashem? "Help me." I, Sussman, should be doing something to help this goy? Doing what? The teeth don't say. I should know without asking? Or maybe I'm supposed to help people generally-lead a more righteous life? Is the answer in cabalah? In torah? Or is there even a question? Tell me, Rabbi-what can such a sign mean? Nachtner-not the narrating Nachtner but the Nachtner in the scene-nods and considers. 
LARRY Staring at the Rabbi. He waits a good beat. He prompts: 
LARRY So what did you tell him? The Rabbi seems surprised by the question. Rabbi Nachtner Sussman? 
LARRY Yes! Rabbi Nachtner Is it. . relevant? 
LARRY Well-isn't that why you're telling me? Rabbi Nachtner Mm. Okay. Nachtner says, look.. . We are back in the scene, narrated by voice-over, of the Rabbi silently advising the fretful Sussman. . The teeth, we don't know. A sign from Hashem, don't know. Helping others, couldn't hurt. LARRY's voice-over question plays over Sussman asking the same thing: LARRY (of]) But is that what it meant?-tet resh nun lamed nun shin isayin, was it "Help me"? or a number? Or was it Rabbi Nachtner (off) We can't know everything. Sussman stares blankly at the Rabbi. A beat. LARRY (of]) It sounds like you don't know Mthing! 
THE RABBI Smiling equably at LARRY. He reacts to the ejaculation with a shrug. LARRY scowls. 
LARRY Why even tell me the story? Rabbi Nachtner 
(AMUSED) First I should tell you, then I shouldn't. 
LARRY, exasporated, changes tack: 
LARRY What happened to Sussman? 
SUSSMAN In his office. Working on different patients as the Rabbi resumes his voice-over. Rabbi Nachtner What would happen? Not much. He went back to work. For a while he checked every patient's teeth for new messages; didn't see any; in time, he found he'd stopped checking. Sussman, at home, chats with his wife over dinner. . These questions that are bothering you, LARRY-maybe they're like a toothache. We feel them for a while, then they go away. Sussman lies in bed sleeping, smiling, an arm thrown across his wife. 
LARRY Dissatisfied. 
LARRY I don't want it to just go away! I want an answer! Rabbi Nachtner The answer! Sure! We all want the answer! But Hashem doesn't owe us the answer, LARRY. Hashem doesn't owe us anything. The obligation runs the other way. 
LARRY Why does he make us feel the questions if he's not gonna give us any answers? Rabbi Nachtner smiles at LARRY for a beat. 
Rabbi Nachtner He hasn't told me. LARRY rubs his face, frustrated. A last question occurs to him: 
LARRY And what happened to the goy? Rabbi Nachtner's forebearing smile fades into puzzlement. Rabbi Nachtner The goy? Who cares? 
EXTERIOR: THE SYNAGOGUE The modern synagogue grafted onto a patch of prairie. An echoing voice rings out: 
VOICE Sy Ableman was a serious man! 
RABBI NACHTNER In close-up he gazes around, weighing the effect of the words just delivered. After a long beat during which he seeks to establish eye contact with as much of his audience as possible: Rabbi Nachtner . Sy Ableman was a man devoted to his community... Wider shows Rabbi Nachtner up on the bema. He and the congregation face each other across a casket down at floor level. . to torah study... LARRY sits among the congregants, his gaze fixed on a point off. 
. to his beloved wife Esther until, three years ago, she passed.. . LARRY's point-of-view: JUDY is visible from 3 behind. She sits a few rows ahead looking grimly up at the rabbi. . and to his duty, as he saw it. Where does such a man go? A tzadik-who knows, maybe even a lamid vovnik-a man beloved by all, a man who despised the frivolous? Could such a serious man... simply... disappear? The words echo. Again the rabbi gazes around, as if awaiting answer.

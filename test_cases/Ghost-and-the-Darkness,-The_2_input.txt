CUT TO 
REDBEARD- starting to suddenly get louder and point- 
-because something is there- 
CUT BACK TO 
THE THICKET AHEAD, and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw it before- 
-but now something begins to move and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and it's all going crazy now, and they're starting to move faster and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON IN THE SHADOW. 
The noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and the movement up ahead is more distinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we 
CUT TO 
A FLASH OF THE GHOST IN THE THICKET- eyes bright- it starts to move away from the sound- 
-and toward where Patterson is waiting. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD. Faster, screaming louder and 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON- he fingers the weapon. 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD, immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors to get left and 
CUT TO 
THE WARRIORS, shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The Ghost's intended path and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, shifting, trying to go the other way this time and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift the other way and 
CUT TO 
THE WARRIORS, racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's path again and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in the original direction- toward Patterson and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND THE WHOLE LONG LINE OF MEN, and it's as if mass hysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and sure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but you couldn't tell that from what they're doing- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last- 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware of Patterson's existence behind him. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the sunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun. 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, backing toward Patterson. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, sighting along the glistening barrel. 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, starting to turn. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, ready to fire. 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE. And now its lips go back as it sees Patterson. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, CLOSE UP, and this is it, this is the moment and as he squeezes the trigger- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND THE GHOST, and a totally unexpected sound- a dull snap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired.

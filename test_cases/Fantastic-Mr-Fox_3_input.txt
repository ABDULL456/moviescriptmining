(PAUSE) Thanks, Kylie. 
MRS. FOX If what I think is happening is 
HAPPENING -- 
(OMINOUSLY) -- it better not be. 
CUT TO: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting crouched in the bushes. Bean licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to Boggis and Bunce. 
EXT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT 
Fox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says 
STONILY: 
FOX Nice job covering for me. Next time 
TRY -- A twig snaps. Fox freezes. 
CUT TO: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the bushes. 
CUT TO: The branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its direction. 
CUT TO: Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the air three times in a row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says, panicking: 
FOX All three! Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark. Silence. 
Smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his flashlight on Fox's hole. In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood- stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce. 
BEAN We got the tail, but we missed the fox. Pause. Bean takes out his walkie-talkie. 
BEAN Petey? You and the boys sober up and get out here on the A.S.A.P. Bring eleven shovels, three pick-axes, 500 rounds of ammunition, and a bottle of apple cider. 
INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT 
Mrs. Fox licks the stump of Fox's tail and mends it with gauze and medical tape. She looks furious. Kylie and the Fox cubs watch, concerned. Ash says uncertainly: 
ASH It'll grow back, won't it? 
KYLIE (shaking his head) Tails don't grow back, except for lizards. 
FOX 
(MISERABLY) Tails don't grow back. I'm going to be tail-less for the rest of my life. 
ASH 
(NERVOUSLY) Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as double-pneumonia, right? (pointing to Kristofferson) His dad's got one foot in the grave and one foot on a banana peel. That's a lot worse than -- Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor. It ricochets off a wall and into a teacup. Everyone falls silent. Kristofferson turns away.

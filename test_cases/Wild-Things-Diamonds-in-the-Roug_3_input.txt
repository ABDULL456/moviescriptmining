JAY You had your chance. (to Marie) If we're gonna win at all costs, we're gonna have to change the game. (to Theo) Do you have it? 
Theo nods regretfully, reaches into a breast pocket, pulls out a KEY. 
THEO I'm still dead set against this, Jay. 
JAY I couldn't care less. 
MARIE What's the key for? 
JAY The diamonds...If that's what it takes, then that's what it takes... 
MARIE But...they're my inheritance... 
JAY All my assets are tied up in the condos, Marie. We have to pay this girl off, make her testify that she faked the tape, faked the evidence. 
MARIE But, Jay...they're my diamonds... 
JAY As soon as I'm out of here, you'll have them back. I swear. I know people, who can...persuade her to hand them over... 
Marie shoots an uncomfortable look to Theo, then back at Jay, uncertain what to say. 
MARIE I t's wrong. 
JAY More wrong than what she's doing to us? We're team Clifford, right? You know I'm not guilty. You know I could never do anything like this. So do the right thing and get me out of this hellhole... 
Marie's cracking... 
MARIE I can't... 
JAY (tenderly) No such word as 'can't.' Please... 
The tears well in her eyes. 
INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The key slips easily into the lock below the dazzling Mother Daughter diamonds. The alarms disabled, Marie's finally able to reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems... 
The Curator stands behind her in the empty Museum hall, ruefully watching his prize exhibit being removed. 
CURATOR I knew the day would come, still doesn't make it any easier... 
Marie, tears welling in her eyes, takes a hold of the diamonds, carefully takes them from the case. 
CURATOR The offer still stands, Marie. If you ever decide to sell them, please give us a first chance... 
Marie turns to him, the emotions overwhelming her. 
MARIE I don't think I'll be able to, I'm sorry... 
She scampers towards the door, past the security guards. 
CURATOR (sotto) Me too... 
EXT. THE GATOR TRAILER PARK - NIGHT 
Theo's SUV drives carefully down the mud path running parallel to the swamp, past countless rusted airboats, and into the 'GATOR' trailer park, finally coming to a halt in front of Elena's rotting trailer. Theo gets out carefully, his $1000 shoes sinking into the mud. Marie reluctantly steps out of the car... 
A blinding PORCH LIGHT flicks on. Theo and Marie spin round, squint through the light to see Elena standing in her trailer doorway...           E LENA Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in... (to Theo) DA know you're here? 
Theo squirms... 
MARIE We need to talk. 
ELENA So talk. 
THEO Somewhere private, maybe? 
INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
An elderly man, UNCLE MARTY, in a sweat-stained T-shirt and ratty underwear, snores on the tattered recliner, a half-drunk bottle of WHISKY hanging from one limp hand... 
Theo freezes when he sees him... 
THEO Who's this? 
ELENA Uncle Marty. Legal Guardian. Drunken pervert, take your pick. Chill. He's out til morning.

He pulls out a bland-looking record: "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS, VOLUME THREE." Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her. 
SEYMOUR This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue. 
ENID Wow! 
Rebecca snorts at Enid's over-exuberance. Enid kicks her. 
ENID How much is it? 
SEYMOUR A dollar seventy-five. 
ENID Okay. 
She pays him. 
SEYMOUR If you don't like it bring it back for a refund. We're here every Saturday. 
He puts the record into a bag. 
ENID I'm sure it's fine. 
INT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY 
Enid & Rebecca sit in their usual booth. Rebecca is reading THE FREE WEEKLY. 
REBECCA That was truly pathetic. 
ENID I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour." 
Rebecca starts looking through the APARTMENT LISTINGS. She takes a pen out of her purse. 
REBECCA He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive... 
ENID It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay? 
REBECCA What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"? 
ENID Oh yeah... 
REBECCA He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one (circles it) ...Oh wait... (crosses it out) you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats... 
ENID I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool... 
REBECCA That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen... 
ENID Yeah, but... you know what I mean. 
REBECCA Not really... 
ENID Forget it, I can't explain it... 
Awkward silence. Melorra enters. 
MELORRA Oh my god, what are you guys doing here? 
ENID What are you doing here, Melorra? 
MELORRA My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break. 
ENID Well, we won't keep you. 
MELORRA I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky." 
Enid and Rebecca look at each other. 
MELORRA What are you guys up to? 
REBECCA We're looking for an apartment. 
MELORRA God how cool. Where are you moving? 
ENID We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking. 
REBECCA Somewhere downtown. 
MELORRA God that's so exciting! (looks at clock) Oops, I should go. Bye you guys! Call me. 
Melorra leaves quickly. 
REBECCA "Funky"? 
ENID What, is she black now? 
They watch her cross the street - she's dressed in expensive "casual" clothes with a fancy backpack.

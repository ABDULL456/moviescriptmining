The cop begins moving the camera crew back.     Phipps continues to Gordy. 
A Paramedic looks up at Mike. 
PARAMEDIC #1 He needs to go to the hospital. We can't take that glass out. 
MIKE If he's not bleeding to death, leave him. He's not moving till they do.

Phipps has heard and understands.      To Dray, re: bodies -- 
PHIPPS Chalk 'em and move 'em. 
Dray goes. Phipps turns to Gordy and the two firefighters standing with him. Addresses Mike -- 
PHIPPS We gotta get on this quick.   I need to talk to him. 
Beat.   Mike nods.   To Gordy -- 
PHIPPS Mr. Pitt, if you can you tell me... What'd you see? 
GORDY (looks up; beat) What'd I see? I saw my family die. 
Mike puts a restraining hand on Gordy. 
MIKE This guy didn't do the bombing, Gordo. He's just trying to get the people who did. 
Beat.   Gordy eases up.   Then, after a moment, defeated -- 
GORDY I didn't see anything except the explosion. 
Beat.   Phipps sees that's all he's gonna get. 
PHIPPS I know this is hard. I'm sorry I had to bother you. 
Phipps goes. Gordy looks over as the bodies of Anne and Matt are placed on gurneys and rolled away. Chalk outlines are all that remain of his family. Beat. 
MIKE We're gonna roll you to the hospital now and get that glass out. 
49   ANGLE - PHIPPS                                                  49 
Walking back to the consulate.    He approaches Brandt. 
PHIPPS Joe Phipps. F.B.I. Counter- terrorism task force. 
BRANDT Mike Brandt. 
PHIPPS What got this place blown up? 
BRANDT We'll have this discussion somewhere else more secure, after I get your clearance. 
PHIPPS Whatever it takes. But I got a bomber in the wind. I need everything you can give me, and I need it now. 
50   INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT                            50 
Gordy's on a gurney on an I.V., his thigh heavily bandaged. Junior and the rookie, Ronnie, are with him, but there's no chatter -- Gordy's shut down, oblivious to everyone around him. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Mike is on a cell phone nearby as Sal, the other veteran from the engine company, enters and approaches him. Into the phone -- 
MIKE Hang on. 
Mike turns his attention to Sal, who's clearly blown away by the bad news that brought him here -- 
SAL Dammit... 
MIKE Tell me about it. 
SAL How's he holding up? 
(CONTINUED) 
50   CONTINUED:                                                         50 
MIKE He's shut down... We were hoping they'd keep him here, and he wouldn't have to go home right away, but they're cutting him loose. 
SAL Want me to stay at home with him? 
MIKE Rookie's taking the first shift. I'm just getting the schedule at the firehouse rearranged now. 
Mike goes back to the phone, and Sal crosses to Gordy. He puts a hand on Gordy's shoulder, grips it firmly. 
SAL Hey.   Got here as fast as I could. 
Gordy sees him, but says nothing. 
SAL I know it sucks... It really sucks... 
Gordy can't go there.     Beat.     Sal releases his grip. 
SAL How's the leg? 
RONNIE Cut's deep, but no major vessels were severed. He's got a load 'o silk holding it all together. 
Junior, who stepped off to talk to a cop, now comes back. 
JUNIOR Just came over the police radio... Consulate surveillance cameras caught the bomber in the act. He was disguised as a cop. 
Gordy looks over.     What Junior just said has triggered something. 
GORDY ... I saw him... I saw a cop. 
Gordy yanks out his I.V., and starts to get up.

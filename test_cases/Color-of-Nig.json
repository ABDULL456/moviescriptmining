{"train": "COLOR OF NIGHT \nWritten by \nBilly Ray & Matthew Chapman \nCREDITS \nCredits start on a black screen, then they continue during the whole scene at Michelle's place, and they end at the beginning of the scene at Bill Capa's office. \nMICHELLE'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY \nClose-up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste musical box. We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and her face shows that she is quite disturbed. Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors. She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away hurriedly from the mad Michelle. \nMICHELLE God !...... No !...... \nMichelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing-table. She takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed. She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way. \nBILL CAPA' OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY \nLarge planes of ground glass. We hear, without understanding them, some voices and laughs. Then a male voice becomes more understandable... \nBILL'S VOICE So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a specific answer... \n... then Michelle appears on the screen. She is dressed in a green suit, she is heavily made up, et she still seems very disturbed. The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New- York psycho-analyst. Beautiful and good taste furniture. Shelves with leather-bound books. \nMICHELLE You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points straight down to Hell, where you belongs !... \nDuring this reply, Bill Capa has appeared on the screen. He is seated. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a necktie, but no jacket. He laughs at Michelle's last sentence. \nBILL OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and swoop down to finish me off. He stands up. \nMICHELLE Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You think that everything got to be either black or white because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He knows I'm not like you \nBILL Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it. \nMICHELLE We all do what ? \nBILL Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have to fill in the blanks. We invent things. \nMICHELLE I don't know what you mean. \nBILL You invent enemies to test your strength against. You invent gods to protect you from these enemies. \nMICHELLE Cutting him. What a depressing view of life you have, that is such horse-shit ! \nBILL Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ? \nMICHELLE No, why don't you tell me \nBILL Take a look in the mirror, Michelle \nMICHELLE Which mirror ?... This mirror ?... \nBILL Any mirror. Tell me what you see. \nMICHELLE We see Michelle as if we were watching her from behind the mirror. I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the view outside actually... \nDuring this last reply, Bill, standing up, is fidgeting with something on his desk. At Michelle's last words, he turns toward her, looking alarmed. But he doesn't have time to do prevent her from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. He yells \u00abMichelle\u00bb twice. \nA STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY \nWe see Michelle's body falling all the way down. Capa's office must be around the 25th floor. The body crashes on the street. A police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. As if the asphalt were translucent, we see Michelle's body from underneath, with the blood flowing around it. \nSEVERAL VOICES All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your car... Stop it... \nBILL CAPA'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY \nWe see Bill with tears in his eyes. He walks to the broken window, and look outside. \nBILL Voice over. My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared... \nBITS OF CONVERSATION Is the aquarium with it ?... That's a blue shark... OK... Was that an after-schock I felt ?... \nCLARK He is dressed with a very neat grey suit. Everything on him is neat : not a hair going the wrong way. 33 and 3 is... 44... 45 \nCASEY He is seated on an armchair shaped like a giant hand. He looks ver \u00abartist\u00bb. He wears his hair tied in a ponytail. He is making fun of Clark. \nCLARK \nCASEY \nCLARK CASEY \nCLARK \nCASEY \nSONDRA Casey, you're such a weenie ! \nBUCK He looks very rough, with his uncombed grey hair. He wears a red sweater without shirt, and a jacket. Leave him alone, will you ? \nCLARK \nBUCK Clark ! CASEY \nBUCK Clark ! \nCLARK Yeah ! \nBUCK Did you read the paper to-day ? \nCLARK No ! \nBUCK He take off his jacket. I was just wondering how many fucking pages it had ! Casey laughs. \nCLARK Oh Christ ! I fell right into that ! \nWe see Bob behind the glass on the door of the room. He wears a shirt and a necktie, but no jacket. He looks pensively at the group. \nCASEY \nCLARK \nBUCK I care that he is late. \nCASEY I don't get it. \nSONDRA I do too. \nCASEY I don't care. \nSONDRA Why not ? \nBUCK Because his father's paying for his therapy. \nSONDRA Oh, my dead husband is paying for mine, and I still care. \nCasey is looking for his lighter. We see Sondra taping her chin with the lighter, then giving it back to Casey. \nCASEY Unbelievable !... Bob enters the room. \nBOB I think we should get started now... Clark... \nHe closes the door. We hear Bill's voice. \nBILL Hey Bob ! \nBOB God ! Bill ! \nBOB'S OFFICE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY \nBob jumps nervously, then walks in the corridor toward Bill. They hug each other. \nBUCK Yelling louder. Richie ! \nHe signals him to take off his earphones. Richie takes them off. \nRICHIE What ! \nBOB Would you like to tell Bill a little something about yourself ? \nRICHIE No ! \nCLARK OK... If nobody else is going to do it, I will. Richie has a gender identity problem, and social phobia, and he's promised the group no to wear the walkman in this group. \nBUCK Doctor Clark, to lay the inventory on. I like that. \nCLARK Oh, Saint Christopher rattles his chain. \nBUCK Saint Michael, sir. CLARK This is not about you. \nBUCK You're right... \nBOB You know what I am saying ?... He talks to Richie. \nRICHIE One feels he has elocution problems. He stutters and looks for his words. I... I... I op... open my mouth to talk, but nothing... happens... except when I... when I do drugs. I... I can't... can't talk... so that's... how come I'm here... They... they say that I... I... that I blush too. \nCASEY Imitating him. Y-You c... can say that again... \nRichie jumps on Casey. Sondra stands up to stop him, but she is toot late. Richie falls on Casey and knocks his armchair down. \nRICHIE Fuck you !... Fuck you !... I'll tear your fuckin' head off ! You fuckin' cocksucker ! \nBUCK Get up! \nThey fight on the floor. Buck tries to take them apart. He succeeds in tearing Richie away by holding him with both arms, and carrying him away. \nRICHIE Get the fuck off me ! \nBOB Buck. \nRichie gets free and walks rapidly out of the room. Sondra tries to follow him. Bob stops her. \nSONDRA Richie ! \nBOB It's all right... He'll come back... \nBUCK Voice over. What do you think, Doctor Clark ?... \nBob straightens up the armchair and Casey stands up sneering. \nCASEY Was it something I said ? SONDRA You are an asshole ! \nBOB You know, guys... A little humanity... \nBUCK Talking to Bill. Funny... Oh, fucking laugh !...We're entertaining the shit out of you, aren't we ? \nSONDRA Why don't you stop feeling responsible for everyone. \nBUCK Would you stop wound-licking, Sondra. \nSONDRA She seems a bit shocked. Oh ! That's very nice ! \nBOB Buck ? \nBUCK I lost my wife... and daughter... And it just can't seem to pass... All right ? \nBILL Very sorry. How did they die ? \nBUCK They say... He starts crying. ... I... I can't talk about it... \nSondra turns her head away : she looks disturbed and moved. Clark wipes his eyes. \nBOB Casey ? \nBUCK Coffee, anyone? \nBILL Yeah. \nCLARK He whispers. Nine. \nBill remains seated and nods to the people getting out. Clark remains, behind Bill, in front of the shelves. He puts something back in a plastic bag and mumbles something we don't understand. Bill turns toward him. \nCLARK Have you read Bob's book ? \nBILL No, I haven't. \nCLARK He puts the bag in the pocket of this jacket, and takes a book on a shelf. He gives it to Bill. It's really... it's quite excellent. \nBILL \"Way to go\"... I'm glad to hear you liked it. \nCLARK He wipes his hand with a white handkerchief, wipes the handle of his black leather case before taking it, and then puts the handkerchief in the pocket of his pants. Very much. Good night, Doctor Capa. \nBILL Bill holds his hand out, but Clark does not take it. He just nods in a friendly way and goes out. Good night. Alone, Bill flips through the books. \nIN FRONT OF BOB'S OFFICE BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nBill and Bob come out of the building where Bob's office is located. Bob has his jacket on and Bob is wearing a brown leather jacket. He is carrying his traveling bags. BILL Alone at last !... \nBOB Are you OK ? \nBILL Well, nobody jumped out of the window. So maybe I am making progress... \nBOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nBob's expensive convertible Mercedes starts away. On the back license plate, we can read \u00abWAY TO GO\u00bb. The roof of the car is open. The rest of the scene takes place inside the car driving through Los Angeles. \nBOB You want to get a drink ? \nBILL Hu-hu ! \nBOB You want to get laid ? \nBILL He laughs. No ! \nBOB So what do you think of my little group ? \nBILL What's Buck's story ? \nBOB You mean, how did he loose his wife and kid. I don't know yet. He's not talking yet... Either ! \nBILL How about Casey ? \nBOB You tell me ! \nBILL Well... I smell money... Lots of it... Maybe an abusive father... How am I doing so far ? \nBOB A Plus ! \nBILL Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown, and the very expensive artistic life style, as long a junior stays in therapy. \nBOB You got the hair on the back of my neck standing up ! \nBILL Yes, I'm a psychic when it comes to masochists. Five'll get you ten he likes to whack now and then. \nBOB Where did you get that from ? \nBILL I was born with it. Like a tuning fork. \nBOB What about Richie ? \nBILL Genuine nut-case. \nBOB Dangerous ? \nBILL Volatile ! Don't fuck with a trapped rat ! \nBILL Good. Yes, Bob Moore. \nHECTOR Four men and one woman. \nBILL Right. \nHECTOR And you sat in one of these sessions, right ? BILL Yes, I did. \nHECTOR So, who did it ? Anderson enters the room behind Bill, carrying a plastic cup. Hey-hey-hey-hey... ! Anderson ! This is civilization, man. What do think this is ?... Your bedroom ?... Anderson gives Bill the cup. Damn... Knock... Knock... Don't... don't come into my office like that, bro. Hey ! Anderson leaves the room and closes the door. It's third world thing !... Where were we ?... \nBILL He blows on the cup. You were probing me about the patients. And I was about to tell you that I really can't help you at all. I don't really know any of these people. \nHECTOR But you're a professional like me. You gotta have some kind of suspicion. \nBILL I really don't have a clue. I'd like to help you, but even if I could, there is an issue of confidentiality. \nHECTOR Confidentiality ?... \nBILL Yes. \nHECTOR He laughs and gets up. You're talking to me about an issue of confidentiality. BILL Similar to the Miranda oath. \nHECTOR He sits down on the desk, facing Bill. If a friend of mine got killed, and the only thing between the killer and me was Miranda, you know what I will do ?... Huh ?... Fuck Miranda up the ass. But don't tell anybody, because it's a matter of confidentiality... Shhh !... \nHe puts a finger on his lips. \nBILL Oh, look ! I'm sorry I can't help you. I've only been in Los Angeles four days. \nHECTOR You're sleeping at that... dead guy's house, aren't you ? \nBILL Yes. HECTOR Maybe something will come to you in the night, you know, like dreams and shit. But... what happens to patients in a situation like this ? \nBILL Usually a colleague will offer to take over the group... continue the treatment. \nHECTOR He gets up. We see his pistol hooked on the back of his belt. How sweet !... How sweet !... It's like one of the vultures dies and then the others step in line and eat his portion. He mimes vultures walking. Is that what you're planning ? \nBILL No. \nHECTOR Why not ? \nBILL Because I really can't handle that right now. \nHECTOR Sure you can !... Come on !... You've been a week in L.A. and you already have you own private screwing farm. He sits back on the edge of the desk. How bad can that be ?... That's a great career move.... Where were you at the time of the killing, Capa ? \nBILL He pauses before answering. I was at his house, Bob's house. \nHECTOR You had to think about that ? BILL Jesus Christ !... Are you going to arrest me, Lieutenant Martinez ? \nHECTOR Hey ! You want a lawyer ? \nBILL Do I need a lawyer ? \nHECTOR You're in L.A. Everybody needs a lawyer. He goes back to his seat behind the desk, and conspicuously shows his back to Bill. All right !... You can go home now, take a shower. He turns back to Bill. And keep your mouth shut. The only thing that I got going for me is that few people know what happened, and I don't want the press fucking things up. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT Bill plays with the \u00abpiece of art\u00bb made of pieces of glass. He pivots it. We can see Bill's face duplicated by the object. We then see Bill putting back in place the same crooked painting that Bob had been putting back in place the first time Bill was in the house. Then we see him walking pensively around the house. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY \nA corridor. We hear the buzz of an intercom. Bill comes out of the bathroom, dressed in a white bathrobe. He is drying his hair with a towel. \nBILL All right !... All right !... Hold on ! \nHe walks in the corridor, looking for the buzzer. He arrives into the main hall, near the video security device. On the wall near the TV set, two large paintings showing enlarged footprints. On the screen, we see Hector's face. \nBILL Oh shit ! \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY \nHector is waiting in front of the gate. He is wearing a grey shirt, a beige blazer and a necktie, and a police badge on his belt. Next to him is Bob's car. Behind him, a uniformed police officer. Hector presses the bell. We hear a beep. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nHECTOR I need you to do me a favor. \nBILL What's that ? \nThey are crossing the garden. Hector is still in shirtsleeves and has some papers in his hand. \nHECTOR I want you to tell the group about Moore's death. \nBILL Me ?... \nHECTOR Yes. \nBILL Why ? \nHECTOR Well, maybe one of them won't come in, or maybe they will all come in, but then you would be able to spot something wrong. \nBILL I just can't handle it right now... OK ?... \nHECTOR I just had all the mess in his office cleaned up. Don't you want to help me find the killer ? Have a heart. BILL What does that mean? \nHECTOR If you don't tell them, I'll have to tell them. Am I the person to break the news to these people ? \u00ab Listen up, you fucking daffodils, your shrink is dead. They have reached the main gate. Hector gets out and Bill presses a switch. The gate starts sliding between him and Hector. Which means that all the time, effort and love you put in this relationship is wasted. You've got to remain as fucked up as you are or get worse. \u00bb \nBILL You are one sinister piece of work. All right, I'll do it. \nHECTOR It's better if you do it. \nA ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY \nWe are in Bob's car, with the roof open. Bill is wearing a green polo shirt, jeans and sunglasses. He is on the phone, while he drives the car, but he drives slowly. \nBILL No, you listen to me. You don't understand, Gene. Don't lie, just give the family what it wants... No... No, you don't understand. We see Bill from the back. In the rear-view mirror of the car, we see another convertible vehicle approaching with also its roof open. A young girl is driving. She comes a bit too fast and bumps into the back of Bill's car. Bill jumps and stops his car. I have to call you back. Christ ! He puts the telephone back on his hook and gets out of the car. He goes to Rose's car. She is leaning on the steering wheel. Hey !... You're right ?... Hey !... He opens the door. She stands back. She is wearing a large beige sweater. \nROSE Why me ?... Hi !... I'm Rose. \nBILL Hi, Rose !... I't nice to run into me like this !... I'm Bill Capa... \nHe goes away from the car. \nROSE I got no insurance... She gets out of her car. I know it's against the law and everything. She goes around her car, and looks at the damage. Don't bust my chops. I'll bring the money to you, if you just get an estimate. She stoops, picks up a piece of red plastic and gives it to Bill. OK ?... Just give me a break ! BILL Got a pen ? \nRose goes to her car and Bill throws the piece of red plastic away. Rose gets into her car, looks into her purse, and takes a small notebook and a pen. Bill takes them but hesitates before writing. Rose smiles mockingly. \nROSE Oh, poor old brain can't remember its own phone number. \nBILL I just moved here... From New York... I wrote my address down, because I am not sure about this number, and how long I gonna be there, so maybe you can call me sometimes for the next couple of days. \nROSE I will. \nBILL Bye ! \nHe goes away from the car. \nROSE Hey !... Don't you want my address ? \nBill gets into his car. \nBILL You could lie. \nHe starts his car. \nBOB'S OFFICE - WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBill skip through the pages of a large notebook, looking exactly like the one Bob had hidden under a Van Gogh dustcover just before he got killed. He puts his back on the two other ones, already lying on the desk. He is wearing a grey T-shirt and an open denim shirt. \nBOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBill enters the room, coming from the workroom. \nBILL Hi !... Who hasn't arrived yet ? \nBUCK He is standing up. He is wearing a white T-shirt and a grey sweater with a V-shaped collar. Sondra... Where's Bob ? \nCLARK That is absolutely correct... A thief would not stick around and stab someone thirty times. \nBUCK He sits down. Since when did you become such an expert on robbery ? \nSONDRA It's not the robbery he's an expert on, it's the rage. \nRICHIE He has seated himself behind Sondra and puts his hand on her shoulder. What... what are we gonna do now ? I mean u...us, th...the group ? \nCASEY I bet Doctor Capa has an idea... \nBUCK What does he mean ? \nCasey hits his forehead. Buck is almost crying. \nBILL He sits down. I think Casey is suggesting that I... may have some plans to replace Bob... Casey sits down. \nSONDRA Maybe you should. \nBILL No... I can't do that... Not right now... \nSONDRA Why ?... \nBILL One reason is that I am more screwed up than you people are. \nCASEY I was just being obnoxious, and loud before. Anybody has a fucking Xanax ? \nSONDRA I have a librium... \nBUCK Stop with the drugs. \nCASEY It would be a good idea if you stayed. \nBUCK Bob isn't cold yet ? \nCASEY I mean, there'll be some connections. Right ?... \nSONDRA She gets up and sits down in front of Bill. She takes the cushion which was on the armchair and hugs it. You were Bob's best friend... You... you seem kind of like him... I'll be so much easier to trust you. \nBILL During the following reply, Richie comes and sits behind Sondra. I know what kind of force a group can become in your life... You tell things here... intimate things that... you wouldn't tell your best friend. I'm very flattered that you would... He stops. He seems ready to cry. But the truth is : You are the people that make this work. I would be more than happy to try to find someone for you to continue this, but I cannot help you. \nCLARK If my opinion counts for anything, I would like to ask : why it is you feel so inadequate for the task. \nBuck comes and sits next to Clark. \nBUCK Maybe he just don't like us. \nBILL No, that's not it, Buck. \nBUCK Why don't you step on something? \nCLARK You stop. \nBILL Six weeks ago, I spoke harshly to a patient. And she committed suicide... Right in front of me. Clark puts his handkerchief on his lips. Perhaps she would have done this, anyway. That's what my colleagues say... But I don't know... \nSONDRA Oh, I'm sorry. \nBILL He is crying with big tears. And my patient... Her name was Michelle... She jumped out... of a window in my office... Ohh... So much blood... And so red... And in right time, before my eyes... the red just disappeared... it's turned to grey... So I don't see... red now... Then I failed... so I can't help you... I don't think that you want someone like me around right now... \nClark wipes his face again with his handkerchief. He seems to be extremely moved. \nBUCK I think I do. \nRICHIE M... me too. \nCASEY Why don't you give us a try for a month. \nCLARK Listen, if you need anything, any free legal advice, to help you wrap up Bob's affair, please don't hesitate to call me. I'm not with anyone right now. I'll be more than happy to help you in anyway. Clark gives his business card to Bill, who takes it. Then he gives him a kleenex. Bill wipes his eyes. \nBILL Thank you. \nWe see, through the window, light-beams crossing in the sky. \nBill has moved slightly away from Hector and turns his back to him. \nHECTOR Special rates ?... Ha ! ha !... What, like frequent flyer miles ?... Hector mime something (or someone) crashing on the ground. Then he walks around his car. Let me ask you something. Are you really color-blind, or is that some shit you feed them with so they feel sorry for you ? \nBILL No, unfortunately I am color... Did you bug the office ? \nHECTOR Hey, for a shrink, you're pretty fucking dense. \nHector gets in his car, while the valet is holding the door for him. He closes the door and the car moves away, leaving a pensive Bill on the sidewalk. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nBill comes to the keyhole shaped door. We can see his car parked behind him. He dial a code on a keyboard and the gate opens behind the door. He looks cautiously around him before walking further. He presses a switch to close the gate. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT Bill enters the house. It is very dark. He opens a glass door and walks slowly, while the door closes behind him. He hesitates a moment, then walk more decidedly... and falls heavily on the floor ! He stands back up with some difficulty, and discovers that the whole floor is flooded. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nBill enters the kitchen without switching the light on. He takes a big butcher's knife in a stand on the table, and looks in the corridor. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBill wades in the flooded corridor. He seems worried and we see the knife blade shining. He enters the bathroom, the door of which is wide open, and opens the shower stall. A rush of water runs out of it. An alarm starts sounding. He goes back into the corridor and turns off the garden hose faucet. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT The alarm has stopped sounding. Bill is wearing short pants and he is emptying a bucket of water on the lawn. Then he spreads a wet cloth on the back of a seat. Several other wet clothes are already drying. \nROSE Hello ! \nBILL Who's there ? \nWe see Rose entering through the keyhole-shaped door. \nROSE Hi !... Remember me ?... Fender-bender !... \nBILL There she is, a little angel, dancing on the head of a pin. \nRose gets down the few steps to the garden. She is wearing a light flowered summer dress. \nROSE So... did you get that estimate ? \nBILL No. \nROSE Waow !... Nice place you got here. It's a little cold... but it's kind of tasteful, right ? \nBILL And wet ! \nROSE You too, I guess. BILL Cold or tasteful ? \nROSE So... Are we eating in here, or you take me out ?... \nBill bursts laughing. \nBIG HOTEL - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWe still hear Bill's laugh slowly fading out. We are looking above the main hall of a big luxurious hotel. Two attendants are pushing a baggage cart. We move with them to the restaurant room. Bill and Rose are seated at a table. \nROSE You can't ? ... At all ?... Waow !... \nBIG HOTEL - RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up on Rose putting lipstick on. ROSE Not even a shade of pink ?... Can't tell me if it's smeared or not ? \nBILL I can't tell you if your eyes are bloodshed. \nROSE Really !... That's sad !... You know what ?... In respect for your infirmity, I'm gonna give up wearing lipstick. Close-up on Rose putting her lipstick in her glass of water. There is something about me that I bet you find a little strange. Right ? \nIn several shots during this dialogue, we see Bill seated in front of a mirror wall and Rose's reflection in the mirror behind Bill's back. \nBILL What is that ? \nROSE Well, I haven't asked you what you do. \nBill sits behind the desk. In front of the desk, already seated, Dale, Richie's brother. He is wearing an open khaki shirt. Bill wipes his glasses and puts them on. He is wearing an open light- blue shirt. \nDALE Richie is what he is. \nBILL What exactly is that? \nDALE He was born back of a van going up Route 5 to a Grateful Dead concert. The first sound he ever heard was \"Beat It On Down The Line.\" \nThey both laugh. \nBILL Well, it could be worse. \nDALE Not much. \nBILL How long have you been his guardian? \nDALE Since he was nine or ten. But I've always taken care of Richie. \nBILL So, what can I do for you ? \nDALE Um, I was hoping you would help me... get Richie out of therapy. Look, I know I'm just his brother, but I've been like a mother and a father to him... Bill takes his glasses off. and I know I can get overprotective, but... \nBILL Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now ? \nDALE What Richie needs is normalcy. \nBILL Well, normalcy... Bill gets up and keeps on talking while walking in the room. Normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways. \nDALE Richie has practically been raised by the state... Bill sits back. ... the social workers, psychiatrists... forcing him into this, um, psycho-servitude. He is the sweetest kid you'll ever meet, but he thinks of himself as handicapped. It just isn't right. \nBILL Well, he's got legal problems. Richie was sentenced by the court to mandatory treatment. \nDALE Every kid gets into trouble. And that's why I need you to help get him out. \nBILL You know, Dale, it's hard to tell when someone's feeling pain... but I want you to know... \nDALE If Richie feels pain... then I feel pain. Pretty much in tune with him. I just wish you'd give us a chance. \nBILL Let me check out Richie's status. Then, uh, I'll give probation a call. Bill gets up. \nDALE Oh, thanks. Thanks, Dr. Capa. Dale gets up and shakes Bill's hand. I really appreciate it. \nBILL You're welcome, Dale. You either lift weights or work with your hands. \nDALE Yeah, uh, I make furniture. \nBILL Really. Bill sits back, but not Dale. \nDALE Yeah, I made this desk for Bob, to remind him of New York. \nBILL No kidding. \nDALE We called it the Chrysler desk. \nBILL Chrysler. \nDALE You ever see his bed ? \nCASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY \nTracking shot starting on a large painting showing a naked woman tied with ribbons. We hear the phone ringing. The answering machine gets on while the tracking shot moves to a painting showing another woman naked but for very small leather panties. She is hung upside down with chains and ropes. \nCASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE Hi. This is Casey. I can't get to the phone right now, so, uh, leave a message. Thanks. \nA beep ends the message. The tracking shot moves on to a motorcycle, looking old, then to another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a bustier, a garter belt and hoses, all red. She is standing on hands and knees and she is wrapped with chains. We hear Bill's voice leaving a message on the answering machine. \nBILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE Casey, this is Bill Capa. It's around noon. Your father sent me a check for the private sessions you were having with Bob. Should I send the check back or do you want to continue ? Let me know, okay ? \nA click ends the message. During Bill's message, the tracking shot moves to a giant plastic statue, with Walt Disney's Pluto's head on a human male body. Then the tracking shot moves more quickly to another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close-fitting sexy black overall. Then a close shot on a painting of a woman wearing a harness with spikes. Further away we see another painting showing a redhead woman being whipped. At the end of Bill's message, the tracking shots ends on Casey lying supine on a weightlifting bench. His writs are tied to the vertical bars where a dumbbell is resting. \nCASEY I think I want to continue. We hear the crack of a whip. Since the shot is showing only Casey's head and chest, we don't see who is whipping him. You bitch ! Another whip crack. I called you a bitch ! Whip crack. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Whip crack. The tracking shot starts moving backwards, but with a larger angle. Oh! Whip crack. Casey's voice is softer. Medium long shot on the room. Oh! I'm sorry. Almost hysterical laugh. \nSONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nROSE She is looking at herself in the full-length mirror. Who's that? \nSONDRA That's my analyst ! He's coming to visit me. \nROSE When she hears Sondra's last reply, Rose's carefree face becomes very anxious. He what? \nSONDRA Oh, my God. He's coming over. \nROSE Sondra, thanks. Oh, thanks a lot ! \nSONDRA What's the matter ? What ? \nROSE Nothing ! She starts gathering her belongings. If you don't know, I thought we were just going to have a nice afternoon together... maybe have dinner. \nSONDRA She puts the telephone back on its stand and takes Rose's arm. Well, we can. Oh, don't worry. Don't be upset. You can stay here. Really. \nROSE She closes her purse and puts it over her shoulder. You just don't understand, do you? \nSONDRA I don't. \nROSE Nobody appreciates you the way that I do. People just use you, and you don't even see it. \nSONDRA Oh, don't be upset. She turns to Rose to look at her face. \nROSE Rose kisses Sondra tenderly on the lips. That's more like it. Ciao. \nShe leaves the room. Sondra seems very disturbed by the kiss. She puts her hands on her chest. \nSONDRA Oh, my God. \nSONDRA'S RESIDENCE - HALL AND SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nRose gets quickly down the stairs. Chimes. Rose gets large sunglasses out of her purse and adjust them on her nose before opening the front door. She opens the door to face Bill whom she almost jostle to get outside as fast as possible. Through a low window, we see her going down the stairs to the street. Larger shot. We discover the sitting-room next to the hall. Good taste expensive furniture, nice paintings, concert piano. Sondra gets down the stairs. Bill, who was looking around him, turns to her. \nBILL Hi, Sondra. Someone just let me in. \nSONDRA Hi. \nBILL I didn't just walk in on my own. \nSONDRA She closes the front door, which had remained open. Oh... no. That was my, um... That was my girlfriend, Bonnie. Yeah. \nBILL Bonnie. Yes. \nSONDRA Please, come in. BILL Thank you very much. Thank you. He enters the sitting-room, followed by Sondra. This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah. He sits on a cushions-covered sofa. \nSONDRA You think so? Thank you. She sits on a small sofa without back. \nBILL A lot of nice, nice things. A lot of nice art. \nSONDRA She simpers a little. What did you come here for? \nBILL Well, I feel like I have so much... so much catching up to do with all of you. And I know that you're very close with Richie. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything that might help me... understand him a little better. \nSONDRA Richie's... my little baby. \nBILL His brother Dale thinks that your \"little baby\"... should be taken out of therapy. \nSONDRA That's insane! \nBILL He gets up. I think it's a mistake too. He goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a park. SONDRA That Dale is a dangerous bastard. \nBILL But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal. There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year ago. Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ? \nSONDRA I don't have much to tell. Richie's okay. He's sweet. Did you know that he was... molested as a child ? She has tears in her eyes. \nBILL No, I didn't know that. He comes back to her. It's sticking out all over. He sits on the bench of the piano. \nSONDRA It's fashionable. She laughs nervously. I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a book, go on Oprah. \nA quiet little street, surrounded by houses an buildings of good standing. Children in roller skates are playing hockey on the pavement. CHILDREN Come on !... Hey, right here !... Hit it ! \nBob's car arrives in the street. The children moves away to let it pass. While Bill is parking the car, we hear, in voice over, the beginning of the conversation between Bill and Clark. Bill is wearing a light-colored shirt and beige pants. \nCLARK Voice over. So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. I had to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of pages in each deposition. \nCLARK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nWalls are white, furniture modern, but with good taste. Everything is meticulously clean and tidy. Bill sits in an armchair. Clark is standing by the window. \nBILL So you were fired. \nCLARK He takes off his sunglasses and gets regular glasses from his shirt pocket. He is wearing disposable gloves. Yes. In effect. Obsessive-compulsive. Medical leave. He puts his glasses on. \"Just please, please don't come back.\" He sits down and sighs. I do apologize for my outburst in group. \nBILL You're screwing Sondra... aren't you? \nCLARK He puts his sunglasses in his shirt pocket, gets back up and start walking in the room. I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra is... A very warmhearted woman, but... While talking, he sprays a liquid from a can on his plants. Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls. Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There were 22 items I couldn't take. \nBILL It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to your keen sense of order. \nCLARK I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect. She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except for the faint smell of perfume. \nBILL Bill sneers. Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ? CLARK Take a look at this. He goes to a closet, from which he gets a paper bag. From the bags he takes out a tattered piece of clothing. Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm terrified to go near the woman. \nFREEWAY, THEN ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY \nCars on the freeway. Among them Bob's car. The car phone is ringing. Bill picks up the phone, while he keeps on driving. He is wearing sunglasses. \nBILL Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa. \nTHE VOICE IN THE PHONE Giggly voice sounding like a child's voice. Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the red car. Bill looks around him on the freeway, and sees a red car on his right. You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr. Shithead Capa. Strange sounding giggles. \nBILL Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket? \nTHE VOICE IN THE PHONE Suck my Tinkertoy, you faggot cretin... after you suck my scalpel, Doctor. \nBill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red car which is still following him. The red car catches up with him and bumps into him. Bill jumps up. \nBILL Goddamn it ! \nThe red car bumps into him a second time, and looses part of its radiator grill. Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road downtown. The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of honking. Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and gets honked by the other cars. In spite of the very dangerous driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on following him. To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the pavement. The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches up with Bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into Bill's car right side. BILL Fuck you ! The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row. Fuck you! Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it. They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close to the curb as possible. Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck... The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump again into each other and arrive into a main road. When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road. Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and causes a pile-up on the road. Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill. Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away. Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ? We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and looking to the red car with terror in his eyes. Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car forward and the red car quickly moves backward. Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back. We see the train moving behind him. \nMEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nA Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular. The first shot shows two hands playing the harp. Then we get a larger shot and we see Hector and Bill talking together. Bill is carrying his jacket on his arm, and Hector is wearing his necktie very loose. There is quite a crowd in the bar, some people dancing, others drinking and some are seated to eat. Electric lines with colored bulbs are hung in the trees. In the back, the orchestra keeps on playing. \nHECTOR I told you to stay the fuck out of it... Hey ! He kisses a passing Mexican woman. ? Como esta? Gracias. \nBILL I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a spooky feeling. \nHECTOR Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy ! He takes him by the shoulders. They walk out of the field, and we see kids hitting a puppet hanging from a tree with a bat. The puppet is dressed in a cop's costume ! Hector and Bill come to the buffet table. \nHECTOR He gets a notebook from his pocket. You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday group ? \nBILL Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain. He takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet. \nHECTOR He takes a tray and starts reading. A woman is serving him from the buffet. Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in intensive care. \nBILL What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ? \nHECTOR Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands died of unnatural causes. \nBILL Probably lost some body fluids. \nHECTOR And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the house on fire. So what do you think of that ? \nBILL I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves. \nA very bright light, coming from above, suddenly shines on the bar. Hector and Bill raises their heads. We hear the engine of a helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker. \nTHE VOICE Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up and your legs spread ! \nBILL'S VOICE It's Dr. Bill Capa. Remember me ? \nLow-angle shot of the office, showing the high ceiling, with a vintage decoration, contrasting with the modern and functional furniture. \nANDERSON Oh, yeah, yeah. The Bob Moore murder case. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - INSIDE CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe car has stopped but Bill still holds the phone. \nBILL I need to talk to you. MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT \nSame low-angle shot. \nANDERSON I hope you're an early riser. I get off at 6:00. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - INSIDE CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nBILL Okay. \nHe puts the phone down, gets his car keys and his jacket, and leaves the car. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nBill gets out of the car and seems very intrigued by the fact that the keyhole-shaped door is open. He shuts his car door, and walks quietly toward the house. He looks around him in the garden, seeming more and more anxious. Finally, he enters the house. BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nStill anxious, Bill walks along the corridor. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBill enters the kitchen. A lot of cooking ingredients scattered on the table. A noise makes Bill turn around. Rose, who was kneeling behind the table, stands up. She smiles when she sees Bill. \nROSE Hey. She snickers. The only piece of clothing she is wearing is a hotel room-maid white apron. Busy day ? Can I get you something ? Bill doesn't react at all. He looks shocked. No ? Okay. She crosses the room to get something in a drawer, showing her naked buttocks. All of a sudden, she seems to remember she is naked and put the two square fireproof cloths she is holding on her buttocks. Oh! I forgot about that ! She laughs then comes back to the stove, where she moves a dish. Bill's face still looks very shocked. \nBILL How did you get in here ? \nROSE Last time I was here, I stole the key. It was by the door. \nBILL What about the alarm ? \nROSE Oh ! I never thought about that. BILL It didn't go off ? \nROSE No. Um, did I make a mistake ? You have someone in the car ? \nBILL No, goddamn it, there isn't someone in the car ! People are getting killed around here ! You walk around like it's goddamn Disneyland ! What if something were to happen to you ? \nROSE She seems not to understand Bill's anger. I just thought that it would be a nice surprise, that's all. You don't look too happy to see me. \nBILL He waits a few second before he cools down. This is my happiness mode. I'm sorry. ROSE She is crying. Bill comes to her and takes her in his arms. I'm sorry. \nBILL I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. This is a very nice surprise. He gives a quick look at her naked body. She laughs. Really nice. I'm sorry. They kiss. \nROSE I'll never take a risk like that again. \nBILL Why don't you take the biggest risk of all and give me... your phone number. \nROSE She laughs and goes away from him and back to her cooking. Christ, Capa ! I can't have people tying up the phone lines. I'm trying to run a business here. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBill, with his shirt completely open, eats spaghettis in front of a lighted candle. Rose also eats spaghettis, still dressed only in her white apron. Bill drinks from a glass of white wine. Rose bites into a asparagus in a slightly erotic way. Under the glass table, we can see Bill's naked foot stroking Rose's foot. With her other foot, Rose moves Bill's pants up. Rose slides down on her chair, so Bill can reach her feet with his hands. Then Rose slides completely out of her chair and under the table. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nA toy remote-controlled tank is moving on Rose's naked legs. The shot gets larger and we discover that Rose is in a bathtub full of foaming water. BILL Voice over. General Patton comes out of the foothills. The tank moves on Rose's pubis, then on her stomach. Oh, he's in the swamp. Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss. The tank skid on Rose's naked skin and doesn't succeed in climbing on her breast. We then see she is lying on her back on Bill's naked body, who is also lying on this back in the bathtub. Ooh! Ooh ! And now... Oh, he's having a problem. He's up in the Swiss Alps, ladies and gentlemen. They both laugh. We see Bill's hand holding the remote control. Fire one. Fire... Oh !... A direct hit ! The tank skids into the water and stops. \nROSE Voice ironically disappointed. Oh. \nBILL Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled. ROSE Yeah ? \nBILL It's goin' away. \nBILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE Hello ? Listen, Casey, y-you sounded a little upset. Just hang in there, okay ? \nCASEY Let me get this, huh ? No ? \nBILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE I'll be by this morning. So I'll see you in 30. \nCASEY Well, you think you can do it in 30 ? \nHe snickers while the hand tighten the collar around his neck. \nCASEY'S LOFT - PARKING IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY \nBob's car stops in front of the building. Bill, wearing sunglasses, gets out of the car and walks toward a three-story, impressive but a bit dilapidated, brick building. Evidently, it is an old workshop changed into an artist's loft. We can still read \u00abNate Starkman & Son\u00bb on the front of the building. Bill comes to a large metallic door and presses on an intercom button. No answer. He tries again. He raises his head to the above windows. No one. He walks a few steps back to get a better view of the building. \nBILL He yells. Casey ! CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY \nCasey is still lying on his exercise bench. Both his hands are tied to the weight-lifting device, and his mouth is gagged. He groans through the gag. \nCASEY'S LOFT - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY \nBILL He puts his hands around his mouth to make his voice louder. Casey ! \nHe comes back to the door and presses the intercom button several times. He raises his eyes and notice a folded fire-exit ladder. He test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of the doors. It seems strong enough for him to climb it. He reaches the ladder, which he brings down. \nCASEY'S LOFT - ROOF OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY \nBill is now on the roof of the building. He jumps down in a sort of yard, in which are scattered various objects : plants, modern furnitures and a full-size very realistic plastic sculpture of a cow. Bill remains crouched a few second, pats the cow's snout, stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of the yard. He notices he is above Casey's workshop. He walks along the glass wall to a closed window, from which smoke is coming out. \nBILL Oh, Jesus Christ. Bill succeeds in forcing the window open. A big cloud of smoke gets out of it. Casey ! Hey ! He walks through the open window. Casey! \nCASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY Bill walks on the upper gallery, coughing with the smoke. He takes off his sunglasses. Down he sees flames around the mantlepiece. He gets very quickly down the steps to ground level. He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are burning on the floor around the mantlepiece. He first tries to put the flames out with his foot, then he takes a small shovel and shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece. A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop, flooding the room with bright light. Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings have been lacerated. On each one, it is the face of a red-hair woman which has been taken away. Bill runs back to the mantlepiece, where he picks up a piece of what he first thought was a piece of paper, but which is actually a piece of canvas from the paintings. On the half-burned piece of canvas, the face of a woman, who is heavily made up but looks slightly like Rose. He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on the floor. He turns around to try to find out more about this slimy liquid. He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable line, start moving toward him. Behind the paintings, hooked on the same cable, comes Casey's body, hanging upside down. He looks dead and sill have the gag on this mouth. The half-naked body is covered with graffitis. The slimy liquid on the floor is Casey's blood. \nBILL Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Shit ! \nSuddenly the blood, which was grey seen through Bill's eyes, turns red. \nA ROAD - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nSondra's car. Sondra is driving. Rose is on the passenger seat, with her Bonnie's hairdo and make-up. The car radio is playing a song. \nROSE I love this song. \nSONDRA I know. \nHonking. Two thirty-year old men, in an open convertible red car. \nTHE RED CAR PASSENGER You girls want to go dancing ? \nTHE RED CAR DRIVER Yeah. We're going to a party. \nSONDRA Hi ! Hi !... \nRose bends over Sondra and kisses her tenderly. \nTHE RED CAR PASSENGER Well, pardon me ! The two men look disappointed. Their car speeds up and goes away. The two women start laughing. Rose stands up through the open roof of the car. She waves to the passing cars. She then sits down and moves tenderly very close to Sondra. \nSONDRA What are you doing ? Rose takes Sondra's hand and guide it under her skirt toward her crotch. Wha... No! Sondra bursts laughing and takes her hand away. Rose keeps on cuddling Sondra who tries to concentrate on her driving. Don't ! Don't ! \nSONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMusic from preceding scene has gone on without interruption. The two girls are dancing in front of the mirror. Sondra is wearing a tight-fitting black dress and Rose a skirt and a short top which shows her belly. SONG WORDS Out all night Lady did. When nobody else would. Lady did And she did it real good. Once was not enough. \nSONDRA Ah ! \nROSE Sondra, go ! \nSONG WORDS Tell me, Katie What would your mama say. \nSONDRA Oh, I'm gonna go change the music. \nWhile Sondra moves away to change the music, Rose goes to the window. In the house across the street, she sees a couple kissing. The music stops. \nBill sleeps on a leather couch, dressed with a western-style shirt and jeans. There is a gun on the low table near his head. We hear a buzz. Bill wakes up, gets up and looks at the security TV set. He takes the remote control to change the camera. \nBILL Who is it ? After two unsuccessful pictures, Rose appears on the screen. She is wearing very short pants, a flowered blouse knotted under her breast and a small backpack. \nROSE'S VOICE I'm back. \nBill opens the gate and looks through the window at Rose crossing the garden. \nBILL Here she comes. Wearing a backpack on her back... making her look even younger than she is. Rose enters the room, puts her backpack down and falls in Bill's arms. She falls into his arms. And they kiss. They kiss. \nROSE Oh, God. I'm so glad that you're here. I didn't know if you'd be in. BILL I don't have to be anywhere until this evening. \nROSE Yeah ? She opens her blouse. She doesn't wear a bra and her nipple appears. So, what color are my nipples ? \nThey both laugh. She covers and uncovers her nipple. They kiss tenderly. \nROSE Oh, God. To be normal like this all the time. \nBILL Oh, God, this is better than normal. This is much better than normal. It's just driving me crazy, that's all. I mean, I don't really know you... who you are... what you do... if you're safe, when you're coming by. You have all the power. I just sit around here and wait for you. \nROSE She cries. You do ? \nBILL Yeah. I mean, other things happen, but... in the \"what I wait for\" department, you're it. \nROSE Oh, my. \nTime has elapsed. They are now seated next to each other. Bill is bare-chest and Rose is wearing one of Bill's denim shirts. They look at a photo album. Rose puts her finger on the pictures and Bill tells her who it is. BILL Bob's wife. My ex-wife. \nROSE She's pretty. \nBILL Pretty fucked up. Rose flips the page. A picture of Bob. Oh, God. I forget that he's dead. She kisses him tenderly to comfort him. \nROSE She flips the page. He looks so young here. God, how long ago were these taken ? \nBILL Ten years ago. \nROSE Really ? Do you have anything more recent ? BILL Maybe. Hold on. He gets up and goes to the shelves. He start looking for another album. I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead as they were pretending. He sits back next to Rose, and start looking at the new album. I don't know who these people are. \nROSE She seems very worried all of a sudden. No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna? \nBill looks at her, a bit disconcerted by her unexpected reaction. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY \nWe hear the birds chirping. By the poolside, Bill is lying on his back on a mattress. He is wearing sunglasses, and is naked except for a white towel spread on his pelvis. Rose is lying on her stomach, head to foot with Bill. She is naked but is wearing one thick woolen sock on one foot. \nBILL One of my patients was killed last night. He was murdered. \nROSE She seems very disturbed by the news. What ? \nBILL The painter. Casey. \nROSE She has tears in her eyes. Were you there ? \nBILL A little bit after. \nROSE What did you see ? \nBILL You don't want to know. He takes off his sunglasses and start getting up, covering his crotch with the towel. About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You gonna be okay out here ? \nROSE Yeah. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nBill enters the bathroom and turn the shower faucet on. Then he gets out of the room. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nBill takes a pair of jeans in the closet and puts it on, without underwear. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nBUCK It's none of your fucking business. \nSONDRA You know, I can't stand this arguing. Really. \nCLARK I'd like to start, if I may. I'd like to apologize to the group and Sondra. While he is talking, Bill keeps on looking through his friend's diary. A photo is stuck between two pages. It is a photo of Rose naked. Everything that you said last week in group was right, and that's why I lost my temper. Uh, the young lady that I mentioned last week... that relationship has been terminated. No reason and no hope. She just, just called... and told me, and that's it. \nBILL He reads what is written on the back of the photo. \"The sociopath, lacking the restraints that... hold a normal character together, can become anything. Amorality frees her to be universally perfect. A charming chameleon with a scorpion's tail.\" Do any of you recognize... recognize this woman ? He gives the photo to Sondra. SONDRA She laughs and brings the picture to her chest. Oh, my God ! Oh ! This is my girlfriend. This is Bonnie. \nBUCK He tears the picture away from her hands. Give me that ! He looks at the picture and turns to her. This your Bonnie ? This is your Bonnie ? Yeah ? \nSONDRA Yeah. Yeah. \nBUCK The one you've been boring the living shit out of us with ? This is the one that's saving you from yourself ? Your shopping mall hag ? \nSONDRA Shut up. \nBUCK The one that makes you smile ? \nSONDRA Shut up ! \nBUCK The one that you wish was a man ? \nSONDRA What are you getting at, Buck ? \nBUCK That Bonnie ? Is that it ? \nSONDRA That's right, that's it. That's right, That's right. \nBUCK Sondra... this is my Bonnie. \nSONDRA She bursts laughing, but she has tears in her eyes. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying ! I don't believe you ! \nBill looks intensely at her. Sondra has started sobbing. \nCLARK He tears the picture away from Buck's hands. Let me see that. \nBUCK He puts his head in his hands. Fuckin' A ! \nCLARK He looks at the picture. Well, yes, of course. This is the woman that I've been talking about. This is my Bonnie. Buck tears the picture away from his hands. Goddamn it, Buck ! Don't do that ! Do not do that ! \nBUCK Hey, hey, hey ! \nThey are ready to fight. Sondra comes between them. The three of them are talking together. \nSONDRA You're lying to me ! Why are you lying to me ? \nCLARK Stop acting like an... Like an emotional child ! \nBUCK Goddamn tar baby ! \nSONDRA You're making it up ! You're making it up ! \nCLARK Nobody's making anything up... and stop it, stop it, stop it ! \nDuring this heated verbal exchange, Richie has picked the fallen picture from the floor. \nSONDRA Stop it ! \nCLARK Quit it ! You're crumpling the picture up ! I want you to stop showing off ! You're a little brat ! \nBUCK Fuck it ! You have the emotions of a styrofoam cup ! \nWe see Richie putting the picture away and leaving hurriedly. \nCLARK You calm down, and you stop... \nSONDRA Where's the picture ? \nLightning, thunder, and the pictures appears close-up in a hand. It is Hector's hand, who looks at them all, sneering. \nHECTOR How in the name of God... could all of you be going out with the same woman and not know ? Not have a clue ? Including you, Mr. Psycho-fucking-analyst ? Not to mention Bob Moore... who probably took this amazing picture himself in front of his expensive painting. I'm gonna call the Guinness Book of World Records... because I think this woman deserves credit. And I'm gonna make sure that all of your names are included... so you can all share in the glory. \nLARRY I don't have your magical tuning fork. All I know is that two people are dead... and she seems an excellent suspect. Bill, salmon swim upstream to mate and die. And so do men. \nBILL Is that what I'm doing? \nA STREET NEAR THE MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR DAY \nAnderson is walking in the street, a coffee paper cup in his hand. He is wearing suit and sunglasses, but also a very flashy necktie. Bill dressed in open shirt and sunglasses, walks toward him. \nBILL Anderson ! I need your help with something. \nANDERSON Hey, man, how ya doin'? \nThey start walking together in the street. \nBILL I'm sitting in a restaurant last night, and I'm looking out the window... watching this woman trying to back out of a space right in front of mine. ANDERSON A beautiful woman ? \nBILL Stunning. Anyway, the next thing I know, she busted out the headlight on my car. \nANDERSON Uh-oh. Drives away, right ? \nBILL I don't even think she knew what she did. \nANDERSON But you'd like to meet her ? Bill answers with a silly smile. All right, um, I'll see what I can do. You got the license number ? \nBILL He gets a piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and gives it to Anderson. Yeah. Thanks, man. All right. Thanks. \nANDERSON Sure. \nThe two men split up. Anderson walks into the police office. \nSTREETS, THEN PARKING BUILDING IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY \nBob's car, still dented all over, starts, with open roof, and Bill driving. He is wearing sunglasses. As the car passes a crossroad, we see, coming on its right , the \u00abred car\u00bb, also dented all over. It starts following Bill. Bill parks his car on a parking lot, at the bottom of a parking building. The red car climbs to the roof of the building. Bill cuts the ignition off, takes his keys and gets out of the car. He starts walking along the building, the red car following him from the roof. The red car stops behind a car parked on the edge of the roof, then starts pushing the car. The car breaks the guardrail and falls down to the ground. Bill raises his head, sees the car coming down, jumps away and falls flat on the ground, just avoiding the falling car, which crashes on two other parked cars. We see the front of the red car appearing behind the broken guardrail. Bill bangs his fist on the ground, while pieces of broken cars are flying all around him. \nBILL He yells. Damn ! \nBUILDING WITH GALLERIES - EXTERIOR DAY \nA very picturesque building with multiple open air galleries. On one of the galleries, Anderson walks toward Hector who is pointing a menacing finger to him. \nHECTOR I ought to shoot you! \nANDERSON I came to make amends. \nHECTOR So make 'em, loudmouth ! \nFull shot of the building. Very typical L.A. architecture, looking almost like a movie set. Anderson and Hector are leaning against the bannister of one of the upper galleries. \nANDERSON I just spoke to Bill Capa. This license plate might belong to our mystery lady. \nClose up on Anderson and Hector. Anderson gives to Hector the piece of paper Bill had given to him. Hector reads the paper. \nNIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY \nBill runs to the door of the house. He knocks repeatedly and forcefully. \nBILL Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! It's Dr. Capa again. \nEdith Niedelmeyer opens the small panel in the door. She looks furious. \nEDITH You leave me alone ! Get away from here ! \nBILL I need your help, please ! \nEDITH Why are you torturing me like this ? \nBILL Mrs. Niedelmeyer, please ! \nNIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY \nEdith closes the small panel. Several heavy blows on the door, which eventually crashes open and gives access to Bill. The house is very heavily decorated. \nBILL But then what ? Rose started coming back ? \nROSE No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie was first. \nBILL Oh, honey. \nROSE Help me, please ! Help me. Rose moves her eyes down and Bill follows her eyes. He discovers that Rose's hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the armchair. BILL Jesus! Oh, my God ! Bill stands up. Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ ! He goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and start looking for an appropriate tool. He finds a big hammer. That crazy bastard ! With the forked end of the hammer, he raises the nail. \nROSE She cries and yells. Oh, God ! \nBill gets the nail off. Rose can't breathe anymore. Her eyes are rolling upwards. \nBILL He feels that she is going away from him. Rose ! \nROSE She goes back to Richie's voice and face. She starts stammering again. Get away f-from me! \nBILL Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone ! \nROSE Still talking like Richie. I never get to be out a-anymore. \nBILL Rose. Come on. \nROSE Rose's head stands up : she is gone back being Rose. And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift. Bill takes off the other nail. It did. It did. \nBILL I know. Come on, let's go. He helps her to stand up, and then to walk. Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here. They start going down to the workshop. Here we go. Here we go. Let's move. \nWe hear the sound of a nail-gun, and a nail clicks on a piece of metal near them. \nROSE Oh ! \nSeveral nail-gun shots. Nails are getting stuck in the various wooden objects around them. \nDALE Shot from behind Dale. He holds a nail-gun and keeps on shooting nails. Back up! He sticks a nail in Bill's shirt. Bill remains nailed against a carved wooden panel. \nROSE She yells and holds Bill tightly. No ! No, Dale, don't ! \nBILL Get back ! Get back ! \nROSE Dale, no ! \nDALE Quick tongue, slow wit. Deadly, Doctor. Bill tries to take the nail off. The nail must have gone through his flesh, because there is blood on his shirt. Deadly. \nDale raises his nail-gun slowly, but Hector appears from behind a wall, holding a \u00abreal\u00bb gun. \nHECTOR Hi, Dale. You fucking daffodil. Put that toy down. Put it in the toolbox. Now ! I got .45 caliber nails in this gun ! \nBILL What are you doing here, Martinez ? \nHECTOR He talks to Bill who is behind him, but without taking his eyes away from Dale. Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out ! That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let that be your psych lesson for the day ! \nAt the end of his sentence, Hector slightly turns his head toward Bill. Immediately Dale shoots him. Hector bends down a little because of the pain, and stands back up to shoot Dale. But Dale is faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood panel. \nHECTOR He yells. Go ! Run ! \nBILL Go ! Get over there ! Get over there ! \nROSE No ! No ! \nDale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in Hector's fingers. \nHECTOR Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go ! Bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm. He runs away with Rose. We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase, we hear an engine starting. Then a whole block of shelves falls in front of them. We see Dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on the controls of a handling machine. Bill moves Rose away from him... \nBILL Let's go! \n... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on Bill, who falls down, stuck under the furniture. \nROSE No ! Get out ! \nDale appears behind Bill, and wraps a leather belt around his neck. He tightens the belt. Bill suffocates. Dale pulls him by the belt across the workshop. \nDALE Come on ! Come on ! \n", "test1_input": "BOB Yeah !... Two mile any pace you like. And then... They mount their bicycles. ... let's do ten. \nThey are now on the road in front of Bob's residence. \nBILL Ten ? \nBOB Too much for you, huh ? \nBILL I dunno... I was thinking of maybe twenty. He starts full speed. They are now on a minor dirt road. We can see Bob's house in the background. \nBOB Gees ! Billy ! You'll never change... Why don't we just drop our pants to see who's got the bigger dick, and then we can go back and have a nice civilized breakfast ? \nBILL Wouldn't be civilized... \nBOB Why ? \nBILL You'll be sulking ! \nBOB They are going uphill. You don't have hills in New-York... He slows down. Hang on a second... Hang on a second... Hang on a second... Bob stops and dismounts his bike. \nBILL What ? \nBOB What was that ?... What the hell was that ?... \nBill dismounts his bike. Bob gets his bike upside down and sets it upright standing on the saddle and the handlebar. He checks the chain. Bill is leaning on his bike. \nBILL What are you afraid of ? BOB I got a gear slip, here somewhere... \nBILL That's not what I meant... What with the security systems, the security gates, looking over your shoulder. \nBOB I've been getting some threats. \nBILL What do you mean ?... Death threats ? \nBOB Pretty sure it's somebody in the Monday night group, I just don't know who... \nBILL Monday night as in last night ? \nBOB Yeah !... I was hoping that maybe with your tuning fork that you might have a hunch. \nBILL No... No hunch, Bob. What make you think it's somebody in the group ? \nBob spins the pedals to check the chain. \nBOB Only about a dozen things... I's been going on for a couple of months now. It's funny how it gets you after a while. \nBILL Call the cops ?... \nBOB He puts his bike back on the wheels. Yeah ! They say if they had to protect every shrink in L.A., they'll need an army ! But that I should call them if anything happened. \nThey put their sunglasses on. \nBILL He laughs. That makes sense. \nBOB Yeah ! Probably, it'll just blow over. \nBILL Yeah ! \nBOB How about you ? \nBILL About me... what ? We see them going very fast on the minor dirt road. A horse rider rides near them. What would you give a suicidal patient that's got everything ? They ride even faster while clowning, like riding on the back wheel. \nBOB Parachute, I heard it already. \nBILL Out here already, huh ? \nBOB Come on, old timer !... \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY \nThe heavy metal door is sliding away. Bob and Bill are getting in. They dismount their bikes with some difficulty. They drop their bikes on the ground. BILL Oh, shit ! You may have to... You may have to carry me in. \n", "test1_true": "BOB You know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to... \nBILL Yeah ! Well, you know... Practice and all... Hey ! How about that : \"Learning to loose\" by Doctor Bill Capa ! \nA beep and the second gate gets open. \nBOB Got a ring to it ! \nBILL They are making those seats smaller, huh ? Whoo ! \nThey enter the residence. Bill is massaging his buttocks. \nBOB'S OFFICE - BOB'S WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nShort low angle shot of the whole building, before entering Bob's workroom. Bob's desk is decorated with two wrought iron eagles. Bob is wearing jacket and necktie. He is just finishing a session with a patient. \nBOB See you next week. All right ? \nHe escorts his patient to the door. Enter Barbara, Bob's secretary. \nBARBARA I'm going now. You want me to lock on the way out ? BOB That'll be great, Barbara. \nShe gets out. Bob takes his jacket off and sets it on a clothes valet. He then stops by the shelves behind his desk and starts the music : a concerto for piano and orchestra. He sits behind his desk, and starts writing in a large notebook. He hears a strange noise, and raises his head. He puts his pen down, open a drawer and takes his revolver out. A draught flips the pages of his notebook. He seems to feel better, puts the revolver back and closes the drawer. Then he closes the notebook, takes it and goes to the shelves. He seems to be looking for something, and feels worried not to find it. He gets out of his workroom. \nBOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHe enters the meeting room and goes directly to the shelves. He looks around and takes an art book about Van Gogh. He checks that the size of the art book and the size of his notebook are similar. He takes off the dustcover of the art book and puts it on his notebook, puts his notebook on the shelf where the art book was and puts the art book in the bottom of the shelves. A shadow moves on the shelves and a strange noise is heard. Bob, a bit nervous, goes to the door and opens it. The classical music stops. Through the open door, we can see Bob opening the door of his workroom. \nBOB Barbara ?... \nHe comes back into the meeting room. When he enters the room, the light is suddenly switched off. He crosses the meeting room. We can hear someone chuckling, and we can see a shadow through the glass on the door. \nBOB'S OFFICE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBobs gets rapidly out of the meeting room. A man, completely covered in black leather, jumps through a large ground glass paneI, and jumps on Bob's back. Short fight on the floor. Bob gets up, bumps into the drinking fountain which falls on the floor, and falls down. Close-up of the mysterious man's hand. It is covered with a glove. The hand closes itself and a long blade appears on the top of the hand. Bob gets up and is stabbed in the chest. He staggers a bit, takes a blue vase on a table and tries to hit the head of the mysterious man. He misses and the vase crashes on the wall. He is stabbed again in the chest. His staggering increases. He turns around and the man stabs him several time in the back. He stumbles to the front door. Another stab in the back. The man grabs him by his hair to bring him back into the workroom. \nBOB No... Nooooo !... Why ? \nThe man stabs him several times. Bob is covered with blood. He falls on a glass door. The glass is shattered. Bob falls on his back. A big piece of glass goes through him and comes out of his stomach. Through the window, we can see an helicopter flying over Los Angeles. MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nA car has just stopped in front of the building. The blue revolving light keeps on moving on top of the car. An helicopter is flying above the building. It could be the same that is seen at the end of the preceding scene. Officer Anderson goes around the car and opens the door for Bill. Bill is wearing a T-shirt, a light sweater and jeans. One can tell he had to dress quickly. Bills gets out of the car, and the car moves away. Anderson takes Bill into the building. \nMAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClassical setup of a californian police station. The various rooms are separated with glass partitions. An officer enters pushing, in front of him, a hooker dressed with a minimum of very flashy clothes. \nVOICE OF A POLICE WOMAN Have you thought about... THE HOOKER Man, I didn't do nothing. Oh, please... You know, you're very cute. I love you. \nTHE POLICE OFFICER I love you too ! \nAnderson leads Bill into a room and leaves him there. Bill sits down. Enters lieutenant Hector Martinez. He is wearing a pink shirt with short sleeves. His tie is badly knotted on an open collar. He has a police badge fixed on his belt. He holds a file in his hand. \nHECTOR You're Capa ? \nBILL Yes, I'm Doctor Capa. \nHECTOR He closes the door, puts his file on the desk and sits down behind the desk. You're here because of the dead doctor ? \nBILL Yes... \nHECTOR I read something about sessions on Mondays. Tell me about this Monday group. \nBILL There's five patients in the group. I Can't really remember their names right now. \nHECTOR He taps his head with his right hand, a gesture meaning mental illness. He has a telephone number scribbled on the palm of his hand. Like five cuckoos. \nBILL No. Four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer. At least, that's what Bob thought. \nHECTOR Bob Moore ? \n", "test1_id": 765, "test2_input": "BILL I bet you've seen every episode of Columbo, huh? Sound of a buzz. The two men look at the security screen. Who is it? Bill taps on the remote control, and Rose appears on the screen. \nROSE Hi. It's me, Rose. The old fender bender. \nBill taps again on the remote control to open the gate, and Rose leaves the TV screen. \nHECTOR That's a very young girl to be going around... fending benders. \nBill puts the remote control down and follows Hector to the main gate. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY \nHector is walking to the exit. As he reaches the bottom of the steps, Rose is going down. Bill, standing behind a low wall, looks at her coming. \nBILL Here she comes. Weightless, hanging from the sky... wearing a short dress of indeterminate color. \nROSE It's red, poor thing. \nBILL Thank you. \nThey kiss. Rose takes his hand. \nROSE I was thinking. Maybe I should see a shrink. \nBILL I can recommend someone. \nROSE I feel better already. \nClose-up on their kissing. \nBILL God, I missed you. \nThey are now at the edge of the pool. \nROSE This time you won't miss. \nThey fall fully dressed in the pool. Underwater shot. They keep on kissing in the water. Bill takes her dress off. She wears nothing underneath. We can see a rose tattooed on her buttock. She slips Bill's short down to his ankles. We get a brief view of Bill's penis. Above water shot. They are now in the water up to their waists. Bill is kissing Rose's breasts. Underwater shot. They are back underwater. Bill is kissing Rose's legs, and moves slowly up to her crotch. She has trimmed pubic hair, but with some left. Still kissing, Bill moves up along her stomach and reaches hers breasts, which he kisses greedily. Above water shot. Bill is leaning his back against the edge of the pool. Rose is lying on him. They are still in the water up to their waists. Underwater shot. Rose is kissing Bill's chest et goes slowly down his stomach, then along one of his legs. We get another brief view of Bill's penis. We notice that it is not erected (certainly to avoid being X-rated). \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nMultiple shots of Bill and Rose making love, seen through the \u00abpiece of art\u00bb. Then tracking shot on the two bodies fondling each other. Shot on the bedroom window, and two hand-glider in the californian sky. Back to the lovers couple. They are sweating profusely. Their position and their movements suggest, without actually showing it, that Bill is inside Rose. Bill turns Rose around to put her lying on her stomach. Rose holds the two sculpted bed posts very tightly. It is suggested that Bill could be sodomizing her. They both moan. The moaning increases with a suggestion of an orgasm. \nROSE Still holding the bedposts. She speaks with a breathless voice. I want you to get dressed up... Get dressed up... All right ? She turns around to face him. I want to get dressed up. \nBILL Right now ? \nROSE Uh-huh. BOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThrough the window, we notice that the night has fallen. Bill, seated behind the table, is wearing brown suit and necktie, very elegant. On the table, wine and water glasses and two chandeliers, with a lighted candle. In front of Bill, a plate with food. Rose enters the field, carrying another plate, which she sets on the other side of the table. In the plate, a piece of grilled beef, noodles et vegetables. Rose sits behind her plate. As the table is made of glass, we see that Rose is naked. \nROSE You're not eating. Don't you like my food? \nBILL I'd like your food five inches to the left. \nROSE Okay. Rose moves the plate to her left, showing her naked body though the glass table. But if you don't like this... I have something else for you. She laughs. \nBILL Yeah, okay. \nROSE I think it's ready. \nShe stands up laughing. Fade out on the next scene. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLong scene on the couple making love standing under the shower. Fade out on the next scene. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nBill wakes up, naked, and alone in the bed. One of his hand is cuffed to one of the bedpost with a long strap. He laughs. \nARCHIVES ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \n", "test2_true": "THE ARCHIVIST It's a miracle. I found it. She starts walking between two rows of shelves. Bill follows her, putting his glasses on. Here he is. Richie Dexter. Legal guardian: Dale Dexter. That's his brother. Kids were put under care, let's see, about six years ago. BILL He tries to read above her shoulder. Does it say why? \nTHE ARCHIVIST Abandonment, abuse. The children were assigned to a, uh... She flips a page in the file. Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena. A child psychiatrist. Richie was 12. Bill tries to come back to the preceding page, but the archivist looks angrily at him, silently meaning he is going a bit too far. No foster parents. Looks like the doctor retired a couple years after that. Then we lost track of the kids until recently. \nBILL What do you mean, \"lost track\" of them? \nTHE ARCHIVIST She closes the file, and keeps on walking between the rows of shelves, followed by Bill. Like on a radar : One minute a blip, the next, no blip. Hey, look. This is the lost souls memorial wing. Children of L.A. County of the '90s: 250 000 cases in here, and there's two more down the hall. \nSONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nThe room is decorated in quite a luxurious way, but with a lot of good taste. Paintings on the walls. Bed covered with an embroidered bedspread, and many cushions. At the foot end of the bed, a small upholstered bench. Two women enter the room, laughing and carrying many parcels, which they throw on the bed. \nBONNIE Nobody's like your ex-husband! \nSONDRA That's for sure. That's for sure. Bonnie takes one of the parcel, a large white box. Okay, okay, okay. \nBONNIE She takes a white dress out of the box. For the first time, we see a close-up of her face, and we discover she is Rose, different hairdo, a lot of almost vulgar make-up, but still, she is Rose. Here it is. Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful. Isn't it great ? \nSONDRA I know. It's incredible. Look at all these bags. \nROSE She shamelessly takes off the dress, and, as she wears no bra, she stands naked, save for her panties, in front of Sondra. Oh, the man that was staring at you in the shop... was so funny. She laughs. Sondra freezes watching the naked body of her friend. I think I should have got it in green or something. \nROSE Oh ! Oh ! Lush ! She has put the white dress on. What do you think? \nSONDRA She seems very moved. I think... you look beautiful. \nROSE You sure ? \nSONDRA Oh, yeah. \nROSE Come zip me up. \nSONDRA Okay. Okay. She gets up from the bed to zip up Rose's dress. Oh, this is so tight. \nROSE Thank you. \nSONDRA I need to find a new husband. They both laugh. Sondra goes back sitting on the bed and looking through the parcels. I need some more money. \nROSE Oh, men. Who needs them ? Have you seen my earrings anywhere ? \nSONDRA She waves the earrings in front of Rose's face. Yes, I've got them. \nROSE Oh, sweet ! Rose takes off the large rings she is wearing to replace them by the earrings Sondra just gave her. She sighs. Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ? \nSONDRA They're so gorgeous, yes. \nROSE Try yours on. \nSONDRA Sondra doesn't move, feeling very embarrassed by the idea of undressing in front of her friend. Okay. She eventually gets up, an starts taking off the belt from her suit. Rose is putting her jacket on. A long silence : Sondra looks more and more embarrassed. She snickers stupidly. Rose looks at her without really understanding what's going on. \nROSE What now ? Sondra, what ? \nSONDRA She sits back on the bed. I feel embarrassed. \nROSE Why? \nSONDRA 'Cause... the way you're looking at me. \nROSE Sondra... Do men look at you like that ? \nSONDRA No... Yes... But it's different. ROSE She bends to her. You know, Sondra... it doesn't have to be any different at all. The phone rings. Rose starts laughing. You better get that. \nSONDRA She takes the phone. Hello. Oh, h-hi. Um... Oh... She seems embarrassed. Rose is making funny faces. Um, mmm, okay. She stammers a little. N... My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's... Yeah. You are? Okay !... She goes to the window and moves the curtain aside. We see Bob's car in the street. Um, oh, there you are ! Okay, okay. I'll see you in a minute ! \nSTREET IN FRONT OF SONDRA'S RESIDENCE -- BOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR DAY \nBill drives and holds his car phone on his ear. \nSONDRA'S VOICE Bye. Bill hangs up his car phone. \n", "test2_id": 766, "test3_input": "EDITH How very enterprising of you. \nShe slams the panel shut. A few seconds, then she opens the door. \nBILL Actually, I was wondering if I could speak to Dr. Niedelmeyer. \nEDITH My husband died last year. If it makes you feel better, he suffered a lot. Well, anyway, it made me feel better. \nBILL I'm treating a young man that was a patient... of Dr. Niedelmeyer's when he was a child. His name is Richie Dexter. \nEDITH Why don't you leave me alone ? \nBILL If I could just ask you a few questions. \nEDITH You get out of here before I call the police ! She angrily slams the door shut. \nBILL Just a few questions. Mrs. Niedelmeyer... \nEDITH Voice over through the door. Get out of here ! \nBill sighs, then walks away from the door. The camera moves above the door and ends up on a close-up of Niedelmeyer's carved face, who seems to sneer at Bill. \nBOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Night is falling on L.A. Clark, in the foreground, is counting books. Behind him, Richie, Buck and Casey are seated, Casey in his favorite hand-shaped armchair. Sondra is standing up. \nCLARK Fifty-eight. Now, if I'm not mistaken... last week there were 59 books on the shelf and this week there are only 58 books on the shelf somehow. \nBUCK Clark... what's the ashtray situation ? \nSondra sits down and Casey sits in another armchair. \nCLARK Three. Not four, as recommended. There are three chairs and five assorted sofas. \nBUCK Who cares ? \nBILL He just came in and is standing by the window. He is wearing his glasses, jeans, open shirt and a light grey jacket. He turns around to speak to the group. Okay, let's get started. \nBUCK Finishing a sentence the beginning of which was not understandable. ... an emotional tar baby. \nBILL Today I'd like to focus on a most enlightening... and challenging topic. \nSONDRA She is - a bit lasciviously - sprawled in her armchair. Sex. \nBILL More or less. You see, the primary romantic relationship... in our life is often a symptom of our illness. He has seated himself in the hand-shaped armchair. \nCASEY Glad I wore my rubber pants. Buck snickers. \nBILL We keep making the same neurotic choices over and over every time we choose a new mate. So... If you had a magic wand... if you, uh, had a wish list... and could change your partner... Sondra, how would you make them different ? What's wrong ? What's missing ? \nSONDRA Now ? \nBILL You need a minute to think about it ? \nCLARK She's totally forgot her Rolodex. Casey snickers. Sorry, sorry. \nSONDRA Well, I don't have an attachment in my life right now. The last one sort of went to pieces. If you enjoy sex... A man thinks you're doing it with everybody. \nBILL He was jealous. He gets ups, walks to a cupboard, opens its door and takes a cup. \nSONDRA That's right. And I was as good as gold. \nBILL Well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires onto you. \nSONDRA This guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in his pants. The whole group laughs. Bill smiles while pouring himself a coffee. \nSONDRA Anyway, I do have this girlfriend. She really makes me laugh. A wish list. I wish... she was a guy. \nBILL He comes back with his cup in his hand. Fair enough. Casey, what do you got for us? CASEY He is playing with a small statue of a monkey who looks at a skull.. He waits a few seconds, and puts the statue down before speaking. Well... I met this girl about a month ago. I've painted every inch of her in detail. She's the best model I've ever seen. Completely uninhibited. Does whatever I ask no matter how... \nBUCK He smiles. I'll bet she does. \nCASEY That's right, Buck. See, but this is where the problem comes in. It's what you see beneath the skin... when you study somebody endlessly, the way an artist does. I see a transcendental beauty there... beyond anything I could ever, ever imagine. \n", "test3_true": "BILL Do you think she loves you ? \nCASEY No. No. \nBILL Do you care, Casey ? \nCASEY I don't know. I don't know. \nBUCK He's a romantic. He loves the suffering. \nCASEY Maybe being who I am... I have no choice. \nBILL Very good, Casey. That's good stuff. \nSONDRA I agree. \nBILL Buck, what do you got? \nBUCK He jumps. Oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that. \nBILL It's not a contest. \nBUCK He lights a cigarette. Hey, Yard Sale, you want to share the ashtray ? Casey puts his foot on the ashtray to prevent Buck from using it. Thanks a lot. He gets up. Forget it. You want to share something, share the ashtray. He sits on a small armchair by a glass table with an ashtray on it. I got something in my life, something new. You know, she's young. Auburn hair, 5'5\", 105. Pretty as hell. I see her on weekends. He picks up the ashtray and moves to sit in a more comfortable armchair. I don't think she'd sleep with a man unless she was married to him. BILL He has taken his glasses off. Anything else you'd like to tell us? \nBUCK She doesn't mind the gray, you know. Bill smiles. She's fragile... you know ? It's like she's running through my fingers. Two people I loved died. I never thought that I could feel anything. \nBILL Good, Buck. Richie. How 'bout you ? \nRICHIE He is playing with the statue of the monkey. I don't have,really, relationships. I have m-my brother. \nBILL Okay. You want to talk about him? \nRICHIE H-He worries a-a lot about me. And he l-loves me. But l... I wish he didn't... love me so m... so much sometimes. I wish l-I had more of a l-life. He puts the statue down and gets up. And I know that everyone h-here thinks that I'm gay... but I'm-I'm not. A-And I don't want to be. Richie opens the cupboard, takes a can of Pepsi and opens it. \nBILL What would you like to be ? \nRICHIE I'd like t-to be a w-woman. \nBILL Have you seen a doctor ? RICHIE Yeah. \nBUCK So the next step is the chop. \nBILL He cuts him very curtly. Thank you, Buck. Anything else you'd like to tell us, Richie ? \nRICHIE Nope. \nBILL Very good. Hi, Clark. What would you change about your partner ? \nCLARK He is manicuring with his handkerchief. Um, I think I'll pass... today. SONDRA Excuse me. You think you're gonna pass today ? Don't you think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group ? I mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today ? \nCLARK Well, Sondra, I have my little problems... but I don't s- see how it's your business... \nSONDRA Your \"little problems\" ? \nCLARK To decide when I'm gonna share in group and not. \nSONDRA Ah, I see. You're smiling. Is that a smile ? You think this is funny ? She gets up from her armchair. Look at you. Just look at you. Look at your hair. Buck snickers. Who do you think you are ? Huh ? You think you're God's gift to women ? Let me tell you something. You are nothing. Nothing but a shallow, rigid... self-protective, anal coward !

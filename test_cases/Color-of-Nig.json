{"test1_input": "A quiet little street, surrounded by houses an buildings of good standing. Children in roller skates are playing hockey on the pavement. CHILDREN Come on !... Hey, right here !... Hit it ! \nBob's car arrives in the street. The children moves away to let it pass. While Bill is parking the car, we hear, in voice over, the beginning of the conversation between Bill and Clark. Bill is wearing a light-colored shirt and beige pants. \nCLARK Voice over. So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. I had to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of pages in each deposition. \nCLARK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nWalls are white, furniture modern, but with good taste. Everything is meticulously clean and tidy. Bill sits in an armchair. Clark is standing by the window. \nBILL So you were fired. \nCLARK He takes off his sunglasses and gets regular glasses from his shirt pocket. He is wearing disposable gloves. Yes. In effect. Obsessive-compulsive. Medical leave. He puts his glasses on. \"Just please, please don't come back.\" He sits down and sighs. I do apologize for my outburst in group. \nBILL You're screwing Sondra... aren't you? \nCLARK He puts his sunglasses in his shirt pocket, gets back up and start walking in the room. I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra is... A very warmhearted woman, but... While talking, he sprays a liquid from a can on his plants. Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls. Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There were 22 items I couldn't take. \nBILL It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to your keen sense of order. \nCLARK I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect. She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except for the faint smell of perfume. \nBILL Bill sneers. Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ? CLARK Take a look at this. He goes to a closet, from which he gets a paper bag. From the bags he takes out a tattered piece of clothing. Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm terrified to go near the woman. \nFREEWAY, THEN ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY \nCars on the freeway. Among them Bob's car. The car phone is ringing. Bill picks up the phone, while he keeps on driving. He is wearing sunglasses. \nBILL Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa. \nTHE VOICE IN THE PHONE Giggly voice sounding like a child's voice. Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the red car. Bill looks around him on the freeway, and sees a red car on his right. You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr. Shithead Capa. Strange sounding giggles. \nBILL Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket? \nTHE VOICE IN THE PHONE Suck my Tinkertoy, you faggot cretin... after you suck my scalpel, Doctor. \nBill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red car which is still following him. The red car catches up with him and bumps into him. Bill jumps up. \nBILL Goddamn it ! \nThe red car bumps into him a second time, and looses part of its radiator grill. Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road downtown. The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of honking. Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and gets honked by the other cars. In spite of the very dangerous driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on following him. To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the pavement. The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches up with Bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into Bill's car right side. BILL Fuck you ! The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row. Fuck you! Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it. They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close to the curb as possible. Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck... The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump again into each other and arrive into a main road. When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road. Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and causes a pile-up on the road. Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill. Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away. Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ? We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and looking to the red car with terror in his eyes. Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car forward and the red car quickly moves backward. Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back. We see the train moving behind him. \nMEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nA Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular. The first shot shows two hands playing the harp. Then we get a larger shot and we see Hector and Bill talking together. Bill is carrying his jacket on his arm, and Hector is wearing his necktie very loose. There is quite a crowd in the bar, some people dancing, others drinking and some are seated to eat. Electric lines with colored bulbs are hung in the trees. In the back, the orchestra keeps on playing. \nHECTOR I told you to stay the fuck out of it... Hey ! He kisses a passing Mexican woman. ? Como esta? Gracias. \nBILL I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a spooky feeling. \nHECTOR Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy ! He takes him by the shoulders. They walk out of the field, and we see kids hitting a puppet hanging from a tree with a bat. The puppet is dressed in a cop's costume ! Hector and Bill come to the buffet table. \nHECTOR He gets a notebook from his pocket. You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday group ? \nBILL Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain. He takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet. \nHECTOR He takes a tray and starts reading. A woman is serving him from the buffet. Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in intensive care. \nBILL What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ? \nHECTOR Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands died of unnatural causes. \nBILL Probably lost some body fluids. \nHECTOR And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the house on fire. So what do you think of that ? \nBILL I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves. \nA very bright light, coming from above, suddenly shines on the bar. Hector and Bill raises their heads. We hear the engine of a helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker. \nTHE VOICE Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up and your legs spread ! \n", "test1_true": "We see the helicopter and its powerful floodlight. \nTHE VOICE Happy birthday, Hector ! Hey, Martinez, come on out ! We got something for you ! \nWe get a better view of the helicopter. The word \u00abpolice\u00bb is written on its fuselage. Two uniformed cops are standing on the right skid. One has a megaphone. \nVOICES OF THE COPS Martinez, happy birthday, man !... Happy birthday ! The crowd starts singing, accompanied by the Mexican orchestra. \nTHE CROWD For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good fellow ! Which nobody can deny ! Which nobody can deny ! Bill and Hector come in front of the crowd, and look up. For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good... ! People yell and whistle. \nOne of the cops standing on the right skid is a woman. She gets her pants down and shows her buttocks to the crowd. Another cop, on the other skid, has another megaphone. People scream when they see the female cop's buttocks. \nBILL If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by tomorrow. \nHECTOR Me too. \nThe helicopter flies away. Large shot on the orchestra singing. \nORCHESTRA Estas son las mananitas. Que cantaba el Rey David. \nIn a corner of the bar, Bill and Hector are eating quietly. Thunder rumbles and the first drops of rain start falling. The two men get up to find a shelter. \nHECTOR Oy. Oigan, ivengan a buscar el cake ! Better get your cake. Ivengan a buscar el cake ! \nPeople stop dancing and run to find a shelter. A MAN Everybody inside ! \nBILL How come you didn't mention Buck ? \nHECTOR There wasn't anything on him. \nBUCK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nIt's raining. Bill drives with lights on and roof closed. On the side of the car, we can see the dents from the chase with the red car. Bill stops in front of a big vehicle. He switches off the car lights, gets out of the car, and pulls the collar of his jacket up. He stops near a car parked in front of Buck's house. He goes round the vehicle. There is a bullet hole in the windshield. Bill touches the bullet hole. He then walks toward the house, and stops in front of the open garage door. Inside is a red car. Bill enters the garage to have a better look at the car. When he gets up after inspecting the car, we see Buck standing behind him. Bill turns around. Buck has a gun in his hand. BUCK You caught me at a bad time. \nBILL Can we get in out of the rain? \nSlowly Buck starts walking toward the inside of the house. Bill starts walking too in front of Buck. They enter the house. \nBUCK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThey get inside the house, which is lit only by the street lights and a unique lamp above the desk. Typical bachelor's place. Very messy. The furniture is simple and practical. We hear the storm rumbling in the distance. \nBUCK Have a seat. \nBuck gets into the bathroom, the door of which is wide open, and grabs a towel. He dries himself and throw the towel to Bill. Bill sits down. Buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan rug. Bill dries his face. He looks at the gun, still in Buck's hand. \nBILL I don't like guns. \nBuck shoves angrily the gun between the armrest and the cushion of his seat. He lies back in his armchair which rocks a little. Bill takes his jacket off. A lightning floods the room with a very bright light. Buck puts his hands on his face. He moans. \nBUCK Oh, shit ! \nBILL Was it raining like this that night ? \nBUCK Yeah. We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter. This guy comes out wavin', \"Stop!\" So I slow down. My wife said, \"No, not here, Buck. It's a bad neighborhood. Besides, the baby's asleep in the back.\" And I said, \"Bad neighborhood, nothing.\" So I stopped. Never even made it to the other car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes wouldn't open. L... Another lightning. Buck puts his hands on his head. Oh, man ! The rain brought me around. This heavy, heavy rain. And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull my way up and... There are two lateral shots... to the head for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my daughter. Oh, Jesus, God ! Oh, Jesus. They got, uh... They got $31. The rain nails me every time, man. \nBILL Did they ever find out who did it ? \nBUCK No. I think it was some kind of payback for something. But that's a long story. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - GARAGE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe rain has stopped, but the ground is still wet. The garage door opens slowly and Bob's car enters the garage. The roof is still closed. Bill is on the phone. \nMAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT \nA telephone rings in an empty office, separated by a glass partition from the corridor. The door is open and Anderson comes running in, with a ready-cooked dish in his hand. He picks up the phone. \nANDERSON Officer Anderson. What can I do for you? \n", "test1_id": 765, "test2_input": "Bill sleeps on a leather couch, dressed with a western-style shirt and jeans. There is a gun on the low table near his head. We hear a buzz. Bill wakes up, gets up and looks at the security TV set. He takes the remote control to change the camera. \nBILL Who is it ? After two unsuccessful pictures, Rose appears on the screen. She is wearing very short pants, a flowered blouse knotted under her breast and a small backpack. \nROSE'S VOICE I'm back. \nBill opens the gate and looks through the window at Rose crossing the garden. \nBILL Here she comes. Wearing a backpack on her back... making her look even younger than she is. Rose enters the room, puts her backpack down and falls in Bill's arms. She falls into his arms. And they kiss. They kiss. \nROSE Oh, God. I'm so glad that you're here. I didn't know if you'd be in. BILL I don't have to be anywhere until this evening. \nROSE Yeah ? She opens her blouse. She doesn't wear a bra and her nipple appears. So, what color are my nipples ? \nThey both laugh. She covers and uncovers her nipple. They kiss tenderly. \nROSE Oh, God. To be normal like this all the time. \nBILL Oh, God, this is better than normal. This is much better than normal. It's just driving me crazy, that's all. I mean, I don't really know you... who you are... what you do... if you're safe, when you're coming by. You have all the power. I just sit around here and wait for you. \nROSE She cries. You do ? \nBILL Yeah. I mean, other things happen, but... in the \"what I wait for\" department, you're it. \nROSE Oh, my. \nTime has elapsed. They are now seated next to each other. Bill is bare-chest and Rose is wearing one of Bill's denim shirts. They look at a photo album. Rose puts her finger on the pictures and Bill tells her who it is. BILL Bob's wife. My ex-wife. \nROSE She's pretty. \nBILL Pretty fucked up. Rose flips the page. A picture of Bob. Oh, God. I forget that he's dead. She kisses him tenderly to comfort him. \nROSE She flips the page. He looks so young here. God, how long ago were these taken ? \nBILL Ten years ago. \nROSE Really ? Do you have anything more recent ? BILL Maybe. Hold on. He gets up and goes to the shelves. He start looking for another album. I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead as they were pretending. He sits back next to Rose, and start looking at the new album. I don't know who these people are. \nROSE She seems very worried all of a sudden. No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna? \nBill looks at her, a bit disconcerted by her unexpected reaction. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY \nWe hear the birds chirping. By the poolside, Bill is lying on his back on a mattress. He is wearing sunglasses, and is naked except for a white towel spread on his pelvis. Rose is lying on her stomach, head to foot with Bill. She is naked but is wearing one thick woolen sock on one foot. \nBILL One of my patients was killed last night. He was murdered. \nROSE She seems very disturbed by the news. What ? \nBILL The painter. Casey. \nROSE She has tears in her eyes. Were you there ? \nBILL A little bit after. \nROSE What did you see ? \nBILL You don't want to know. He takes off his sunglasses and start getting up, covering his crotch with the towel. About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You gonna be okay out here ? \nROSE Yeah. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nBill enters the bathroom and turn the shower faucet on. Then he gets out of the room. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nBill takes a pair of jeans in the closet and puts it on, without underwear. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \n", "test2_true": "BOB'S RESIDENCE - UPPER GALLERY - INTERIOR DAY \nBill comes out of the dressing room, and into a gallery above the sitting room. He sees Rose looking through the album, taking a picture out of the album and then putting the album back where it was. He hides behind a wall for her not to see him. She is looking inside a photo-lab envelope. Bill comes out of his hiding. \nBILL Rose. \nROSE She jumps. Oh ! Oh ! She drops the envelope, picks up her backpack and runs out of the room. \nBILL Rose ! Rose ! \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY \nRose runs to the keyhole-shaped door. The gate opens and Rose runs out. BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nBill runs down the stair from the upper gallery. He is bare chest with his shirt in his hand. \nBOB'S RESIDENCE - ROAD IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY \nRose gets out of the residence and runs to her car, a small ORV. She climbs in and starts very fast. Bill gets out of the house. \nBILL He jumps into his car without opening the door. Rose ! Jesus ! \nBob's car get's out of the residence. \nMAIN ROAD, THEN CITY STREETS - EXTERIOR DAY \nWe see Bill driving his car. He chases Rose, whom we then see in her car. Tires screech with the high speed driving. Bill comes closer to Rose and tries to memorize her license plate numbers. BILL 2ASB... 185... \nThe chase goes on. Rose drives very recklessly, Bill too. He drives through the cross roads without slowing down. A man, who was seated on a low wall, has to climb on it to avoid Bill's car, which is driving on the sidewalk. Bill stops near him. We hear the voice of an angry woman. \nVOICE OF THE ANGRY WOMAN Oh ! Stupid, crazy bastard ! They'll give anybody a license ! \nBOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nOutside, night has fallen and it is raining. \nCLARK He is very smartly dressed, and even wears a bow tie. He counts the books on the shelves. Five and six are 31. Seven, seven, that makes 45. And that will remain 45, and every single time you count it, it will be 45, no matter what. And then this is five, and that makes 50. And nine is 59. Now that's odd. That's really odd. Now there's 59 again. \nBILL He has just come into the room. What ? \nCLARK Well, last week... there were 58 books on the bookshelf where there is always... and I mean always, 59 books, and this week there are 59 again, so I don't... \nBILL He turns toward Sondra. Which one, Sondra ? SONDRA She is very smartly dressed too, in a white suit with black collar. She sighs. I didn't read any of it. Really. I felt so bad when I got it home. I couldn't help myself. \nBILL He moves rapidly to the shelves. Which one, Sondra ? \nSONDRA It... The Van Gogh. But I didn't read any of it. Honestly, I promise ! \nBill takes the book and moves away from the shelves. Sondra signs menacingly to Clark. \nCLARK What did I do ? \nBill has seated himself, and he looks through the book. Sondra tries to read above his shoulder. Close-up of the book. It is Bob's diary. Close-up on one paragraph. We hear Bob's voice reading the paragraph. \nBOB'S VOICE I was right about the threats from the Monday group. This cycle of pain. Yesterday's victim becomes tomorrow's monster. Today's the day. \nBuck enters the room. \nBILL Hi. \nBuck starts closing the door, but Richie comes in. \nBUCK Hi, Bill. \nBILL Hi, Buck. Buck sits down. Casey, uh... is not gonna be joining us tonight, so I think we should get started. \nBUCK That's typical. Thunder rumbles. Buck puts his hands on his head. Richie looks at him. Oh, shit! \nCLARK Buck, are you all right ? \n", "test2_id": 766, "test3_input": "BILL But then what ? Rose started coming back ? \nROSE No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie was first. \nBILL Oh, honey. \nROSE Help me, please ! Help me. Rose moves her eyes down and Bill follows her eyes. He discovers that Rose's hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the armchair. BILL Jesus! Oh, my God ! Bill stands up. Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ ! He goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and start looking for an appropriate tool. He finds a big hammer. That crazy bastard ! With the forked end of the hammer, he raises the nail. \nROSE She cries and yells. Oh, God ! \nBill gets the nail off. Rose can't breathe anymore. Her eyes are rolling upwards. \nBILL He feels that she is going away from him. Rose ! \nROSE She goes back to Richie's voice and face. She starts stammering again. Get away f-from me! \nBILL Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone ! \nROSE Still talking like Richie. I never get to be out a-anymore. \nBILL Rose. Come on. \nROSE Rose's head stands up : she is gone back being Rose. And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift. Bill takes off the other nail. It did. It did. \nBILL I know. Come on, let's go. He helps her to stand up, and then to walk. Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here. They start going down to the workshop. Here we go. Here we go. Let's move. \nWe hear the sound of a nail-gun, and a nail clicks on a piece of metal near them. \nROSE Oh ! \nSeveral nail-gun shots. Nails are getting stuck in the various wooden objects around them. \nDALE Shot from behind Dale. He holds a nail-gun and keeps on shooting nails. Back up! He sticks a nail in Bill's shirt. Bill remains nailed against a carved wooden panel. \nROSE She yells and holds Bill tightly. No ! No, Dale, don't ! \nBILL Get back ! Get back ! \nROSE Dale, no ! \nDALE Quick tongue, slow wit. Deadly, Doctor. Bill tries to take the nail off. The nail must have gone through his flesh, because there is blood on his shirt. Deadly. \nDale raises his nail-gun slowly, but Hector appears from behind a wall, holding a \u00abreal\u00bb gun. \nHECTOR Hi, Dale. You fucking daffodil. Put that toy down. Put it in the toolbox. Now ! I got .45 caliber nails in this gun ! \nBILL What are you doing here, Martinez ? \nHECTOR He talks to Bill who is behind him, but without taking his eyes away from Dale. Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out ! That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let that be your psych lesson for the day ! \nAt the end of his sentence, Hector slightly turns his head toward Bill. Immediately Dale shoots him. Hector bends down a little because of the pain, and stands back up to shoot Dale. But Dale is faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood panel. \nHECTOR He yells. Go ! Run ! \nBILL Go ! Get over there ! Get over there ! \nROSE No ! No ! \nDale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in Hector's fingers. \nHECTOR Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go ! Bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm. He runs away with Rose. We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase, we hear an engine starting. Then a whole block of shelves falls in front of them. We see Dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on the controls of a handling machine. Bill moves Rose away from him... \nBILL Let's go! \n... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on Bill, who falls down, stuck under the furniture. \nROSE No ! Get out ! \nDale appears behind Bill, and wraps a leather belt around his neck. He tightens the belt. Bill suffocates. Dale pulls him by the belt across the workshop. \nDALE Come on ! Come on ! \n", "test3_true": "BILL You fucking son of a bitch ! Dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on the bars of the cage. Sparks spring up. You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little brother killed. \nDALE No ! \nBILL You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him. \nDALE No, I saved him ! \nBILL You knew what was happening... \nDALE I didn't know ! \nBILL Because it happened to you before ! \nDALE Would you goddamn shut up ? \nBILL Could have saved your little brother, but he killed himself. DALE He is getting angry. Shut up ! Shut the fuck up ! \nBILL You failed, Dale. And you made Rose become Richie ! \nDALE He calms down and smiles. Oh, you're smart. You're really smart. Bob Moore was smart, but I put a stop to that. \nBILL Yeah, you did. He coughs. Why'd you kill Casey, Dale? \nDALE Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh ? Y-You can't keep your fucking hands off of us. Huh ? Always pokin' and pushin'. Huh ? While talking, he keeps on switching his saw on and off. BILL Why'd you do it, Dale ? \nDALE Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after night. Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her... gonna recognize Richie in group. Well, I might have missed old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good. - And now... He starts his saw. Sparks spring up on the edge of the cage. I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off. \nBILL He snickers. The inspiration of madness, Dale. \nDALE The tyranny of normalcy, Bill. \nHe starts his saw again, and slowly moves it close to Bill. We hear the sound of the nail-gun and a nail gets stuck in Dale's shoulder. The saw stops. Dale walks back a few steps to face Rose, holding the nail-gun pointed on him. \nDALE Richie. \nROSE My name is... My name is Rose. He rushes on her. She shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of his forehead. Dale falls down. Rose starts screaming. No ! No ! Bill tries to get the belt off his neck. Rose raises the gun to her throat, and presses the trigger. But it doesn't work. She tries again. It still doesn't work. The gun must be empty. No ! Bill eventually succeeds in getting free, but Rose, after she has thrown the gun away, starts running through the workshop. No ! \nBILL He runs after her. Rose ! Rose ! Come back ! Rose ! \nDALE'S WORKSHOP - CHIMNEY - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nRose starts climbing the ladder mounted on the body of the chimney. Bill follows her and yells. \nBILL Rose ! Rose ! Stop ! Rose ! Rain is soaking both of them, but they keep on climbing. Thunder is rumbling. A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill climbing on it. Wait ! Rose! \nROSE She sobs. Don't ! \nBILL For God's sakes, don't jump ! Rose ! \nROSE She has reached the circular platform on the top of the chimney. She yells. No ! \nBILL Rose ! Stop ! \nBILL He reaches the platform. No ! No. No ! \nBILL Wait ! \nROSE Why ? \nBILL Rose ! No ! Stop, please ! Rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform. Just stay there ! \nROSE It's too late. I've gone too far. I can't go back. \nBILL If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God. \nROSE Why would you do that ? BILL Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die. Just give me your hand.

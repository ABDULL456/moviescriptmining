{"train": "CARRIE II \nWritten by \nRafael Moreu \n13 FEBRUARY 1998 \n\"I wish that I could write you a melody so plain That would save you dear lady from going insane\" Bob Dylan, Tombstone Blues \nBLACK \nMUSIC UP: Slow, sad, ethereal. Perhaps even eerie. \nFADE IN: \nOn a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without waves or ripples. \nA thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint. The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood. FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal... \nINT. A HOUSE - NIGHT \nA white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out. A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can, then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall: until it reaches &pleated drape -- -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped. \nA PUPPY, a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird. The dog looks over to... \nA FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the verge of tears. \nThe BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral, forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame. \nAnother ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel to the floor, extending around a modest living room. \nPainting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn, haggard- She hasn't slept in a while. \nThe precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a little frightening. \nRACHEL \nMommy \nBARBARA hears nothing, says nothing, just wipes a paint drip. This is a very careful line. \nRACHEL Momma, come play with me. In my room. But her mother keeps painting across a door. \nRACHEL Right now, mommy, okay? BARBARA looks at her, or rather through her. And continues her task. RACHEL steps forward, tugs on her mom's \nRACHEL I got a idea, we could-- -- and gets , , splat, right-in the face with the brush \nTHE KITCHEN A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor. RACHEL's tiny hand deliberately presses a button on it. The TOY responds with a wheep whe ep siren, then: \nAMBULANCE VOICE \n(CANNED; TINNY) If you need help, dial nine one one. If you need help, dial nine one one. \nA WALL-MOUNTED PHONE RACHEL's HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1. BARBARA's still painting the wall in the background. \nRACHEL (O.S.) Hello? It's my mom. She's doing some... some wrong things. She's doing wrong things, so, and, you should come. \nEXT. THE STREET - FROM ABOVE - NIGHT \nA light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE Its dashing red lights CRUISER with its doors flung open. splash over the umbrella carrying NEIGHBORS, in pajamas and robes, watching... \n(TO RACHEL) Was the dog in the house last night? He's allowed in the morning. \nBOYD (head in refrigerator) Daytime, yes; nighttime, no. We've been over this ground. I only brought him in this morning. No juice? \nEMILYN We're out of a lot of things. \n(TO RACHEL) I heard dog noises last night. When I was trying to sleep. \n(LOUDER) Walter was not in the house last night. \nBOYD (shoots Rachel a look) You watch that voice in this house. While you're here, you'll respect her as your mother, and treat her as such. \nRACHEL (lowers her eyes, mumbles) Sorry. She picks through her cold cereal in silence. \nEMILYN Your mom's making progress isn't she, on the new medicacions, the tricyclics? \nRACHEL Yes, ma'am. \n(BEAT) May I be excused? Without waiting for a reply, she stands and gathers the bowl. (casually, a routine) And you should take that thing outta your nose. Don't you have enough holes in your head? As she turns away, RACHEL makes a face, but replies. \nRACHEL Yes, sir. \nEXT. HOUSE - MORNING \nRACHEL stands outside, clad in a long dark overcoat, with a black backpack. WALTER sits next to her, behind a fence. A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up. \nRACHEL Later, Walt. On WALTER, bummed. \nWITHIN THE SCHOOL BUS A gaggle of young KIDS in faded denims and pastels. RACHEL moves to the back, sits with LISA PARKER, who could be her younger sister, also dressed Goth, black lace and metal. LISA has a HEART-THORN TATTOO around her arm, like RACHEL's. \nLISA \n(SMILES) Well, hullo. \nRACHEL She speaks. She opens her mouth and sounds come out. The sounds are words. LTA gives her a Cheshire cat grin. \nLISA What's wrong, fcscer-dad bein' a pain again? \nRACHEL Why are you so weiz.ly happy? \nLISA o I look any different? \nRACHEL Do you look any... \n(GETTING IT) Oh, my gawd. You did it. \nLISA Yep. With who? \nLISA You'd never believe me if I told you. I'm bringing him to lunch. \nRACHEL C'mon. ' 1 Fess up. \nLISA All will be revealed in due time. RACHEL pulls out a worn Anne Rice paperback from her ba gives it to LISA. \nRACHEL You suck. \nLISA I love you too. Simultaneously, they bite their thumbs, then press them together; a pantomime of blood sisters. \nLISA / RACHEL Best Blood. / Best Blood. ARNIE, a skinny, pimply stoner, plops into the seat behind them, sticks his head on their seatback, smiles full braces. \nARNIE Hi there gruesome twosome, how 'bout a threesome? \nENGLISH TEACHER Romeo and Juliet, a tale of two lovers meant for each other, pulled apart by their families, society, and, some might say, by fate. \n(BEAT) Why is it that we are so moved by love stories that end with separation? The STUDENT' s faces are blank. \nENGLISH TEACHER What are some other stories with this theme? \n(NO RESPONSES) How about, Dr. Zhivago? Casablanca? Still blank. AMY timidly raises her hand. \nAMY You meair like in Dumb and when the girl's husband showed up? The TEACHER surrenders to the inevitable. \nENGLISH TEACHER Okay, well. Perhaps at some level we know that Lauren Holly's husband AIM to show up? What say? Anyone? \n(BEAT) Rachel? I don't know that I believe in it. \nENGLISH TEACHER Believe in what? \nRACHEL Love. JESSE looks at her, pensive. \nENGLISH TEACHER \n(SYMPATHETIC) Well, then you've got bigger problems than passing this crass. \nARNIE (raises his hand) Love is fifteen seconds of squishing noises. Unquote. Johnny Rotten. Scattered laughs. JESSE overhears TRACY as she nods at RACHEL, whispers to AMY... \nTRACY Who would love her? \nENGLISH TEACHER Do you think that all love stories are tragedies? I mean, unless they die at the same time, all lovers are eventually separated by death. \nJESSE Well, then Romeo and Juliet isn't a tragedy, because the only way they could really be together was in death. \nENGLISH TEACHER Very good. (nods at Rachel) A foul cynic, most cliche. (turns to Jesse) A true romantic, how refreshing. Kids scoff at JESSE, but RACHEL eyes JESSE, struck by this side of him. The BELL rings and ARNIE leads the exodus. \nARNIE Food! \nENGLISH TEACHER Next assignment, Brave New World, the book, not the TV movie. \nINT, HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY A stone-faced LISA folds a NOTE, places it within her hallway locker, jammed to the brim with books; a photo of Fiona Apple and a Nine Inch Nails sticker are plastered on its door. \nEXT.

RACHEL appears, searching for LISA. \nBACK TO: \nTHE SCHOOL HALLWAY LISA walks as if moving through extremely dense air, hugging the wall as STUDENTS pass without acknowledging her. \nHACK TO: \nTHE PARKING LOT RACHEL looks around the students, sees a GIRL's HEAD from behind, realizes it isn't LISA. \nBACK TO: \nA STAIRWELL LISA ascends several flights, still brushing the wall, exiting onto the... \nSCHOOL'S ROOF She walks past a TRIO OF STUDENTS smoking near the roof's edge. Without slowing or blinking an eyelash LISA simply.. \nDROPS OUT OF FRAME. A GIRL turns in the direction of LISA's disappearance. \nSMOKING GIRL Did you see that? \nSHOCK CUT TO: \n(PAUSE) Copycats. Everybody got it? Nods all around. \nPRINCI PAL Then let's go with the drill.

BARBARA is lucid and beaming at her. \nBARBARA Yes, baby, I really am feeling so much better.

I wane to hear every little thing I'm missing. \nRACHEL takes a deep breath, working extra hard to seem happy and well adjusted today. \nRACHEL Things are really great. Last night I, um, I had this slumber party, with some girlfriends. And this morning, Mrs. Wallace made us all pancakes before school. \nBARBARA The Wallaces sure are a nice family. \nRACHEL (her smile falters) Oh, they are.

A fire. \nMARK I'm not. We've been friends since we could both pee standing up. And I thought we'd be best friends forever. \n(BEAT) Never thought some girl could come between that. Look, I know I'm scum.

We're doing more than just thinking. \nWALSH I need the boy for the game. \nSTARK Robbie, we've known each other a long time, since you were a Bulldog. \nKELTON Save it, Lou. Sue Snell told me there were other girls-- \nWALSH Those kinds of girls know what they're getting in to. Eric's a good kid, he may be guilty of some youthful \nTRANSGRESSIONS-- \nKELTON Youthful transgressions?

You want to be responsible for tarnishing all these boys lives? \nMAYOR Well. I think that about sums it up. He looks at the D.A., as if to give him his cue. \nD.A. Robbie, I just don't think I have enough evidence to ruin this boy's reputation. \nKELTON \nBUT-- \nD.A. That's it, Robbie. That's all. \nMAYOR Lou, thank you for coming in.

RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRACHEL before the mirror, applying the lipstick. A P.J. HARVEY song plays under, slow, insistent, seductive: \nP.J. HARVEY She's burst/ dropped off! picked the fruit! realize! I'm naked / I'm naked too./ So cover rrry body/ dress it fine/ hide my linen and lace. She pulls on a silver, thrift-shop SLIP DRESS, moves a slee ve to cover her tattoo. \nP.J.

He gestures to hib'nose, indicating her stud. \nRACHEL Took it off. \nJESSE Too bad. I like it. It's different. RACHEL looks at the car seat.

But we won't go if y;,u,d be uncomfortable. \nHe moves to the bed. \nRACHEL No. Let's go. \nThe entire town has showed for this traditional rivalry and there's Bulldog paraphernalia galore. RACHEL appears in the stands, looking a bit lost. Down front sit MONICA and AMY. On the field are TRACY and her fellow CHEERLEADERS. MONICA nudges AMY and waves to \nMONICA Rachel, Rach, over here. Hey. Grab a seat. Looking around, RACHEL sees she's surrounded by Patio People. \nRACHEL Thanks, but... \nMONICA Oh, please, you're.not gonna sit by your lonesome.

FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT \nJESSE enters, mounds of hair are at his feet. He looks up. MARK and most of the BULLDOGS have shaved their heads and are working on the last players. They turn to him in unison. CHUCK grins, runs his hand over his scalp. \nCHUCK We did it for the big game. \nMARK C'mon, Jess, you're up. JESSE stares in horror at how identical they all look now. Then he starts to... giggle, then breaks into laughter, turns and walks away. \nA P-ALN Man, he'll ruin the whole effect. \nEXT. THE STANDS - NIGHT \nMONICA and RACHEL. \nMONICA No, no, it's an extra point when you score the kick after the touchdown. A safety is when you get tackled with the ball in your own end zone. \nRACHEL Thought that was a bunt. What? \nRACHEL I'm kidding, I'm kidding. \nMONICA Okay, listen. Here's what Brad told me to say, doesn't matter if something good or bad happens, just say \"You. gotta be fuckin' kiddin' mel\" No matter what, just say that.

A NOTRE DAME SCOUT, wearing a \"Fighting Irish jacket, toting a clipboard. JESSE then spots RACHEL in the stands, gives her a reassuring grin. She glances at the SCOUT, smiles back at JESSE. TRACY sees them, is none too happy. SLOW MOTION -- A whistle sounds as a FOOTBALL is kicked to start the game. The BALL spins end over end until... \nIt's caught by a BULLDOG receiver who starts his return, then is popped hard and FUMBLES. An OPPOSING PLAYER leaps onto the ball on the muddy quagmire of a field. n the stands... \nRACHEL, MONICA, AMY (in accidental unison) You gotta be fuckin' kiddie' me! They turn to each other, burst into laughter. MONTAGE -- of the punishing game. Epic warfare with grunting, spitting and cursing as LINEMAN butt heads and. -- A CARLIN RUNNING BACK steamrolls through the BULLDOGS for a touchdown. -- RACHEL, MONICA and AMY do their You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me routine. JESSE catches a pass, and is immediately slammed hard \nCARLIN PLAYER.

ARKHAM STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nmpatient SUE sits before an exhausted DOCTOR NELSON. \nDOCTOR Well... I understand you need to take out Mrs. Lang, to do a drug-abuse intervention with her daughter. But while she's doing well, her condition may be fragile. \nThe bedroom door is opened by EMILYN. SUE and BARBARA stand behind her. They find WALTER, alone on the bed, blinking awake. \nMARK BING'S HOUSE - NIGHT An upper-class home built in the international style of fieldstone and gray-stained wood. The house is set back from the road, surrounded by trees, with a pool in the back. A herd of parked cars and throbbing music indicate MARK's party is at full tilt. \nINT. MARK BING'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON -- a 36-INCH TV playing psychedelic music videos and Japanese anima. WIDEN -- to reveal a DANCING'CROWD in a dimly lit, split- level living room with exposed wooden beams. There's a large, roaring fireplace and a Jackson Pollock splatter PAINTING hangs opposite. Sliding glass doors overlook the backyard patio and swimming pool. CHUCK cuts through, sees someone jostle a table lamp. \nCHUCK Careful! Don't break anything, or Mark'll have my head on,a plate. \nEXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMONICA leads RACHEL up the walkway to the front door where a BEEFY BOY plays doorman. ARNIE and two geeky YOUNGER BOYS mill outside the door, trying their damndest to look cool. \nARNIE Hey, Monica, can ya get us into the party? \nMONICA Sure, Arnie, wait here. I'll come back for ya.. . And she waltzes past him. \nMONICA (CONT'D) . in two or three years. ARNIE points at a passing RACHEL. \nAPISI E How come she gets to go in? \nMONICA (rais6s a toast) To new friends. They raise their glasses and RACHEL joins in with a hesitant smile. Their glasses clink together for the... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nJESSE crosses the near empty lot, hair wet from his shower. He stops dead. \nJESSE Damn it. Under a pool of lamplight -- HIS CAR has had its tires slashed and someone has sprayed in red Carlin uies!\u00e2\u0096 across the door. TRACY pulls up in. her BMW, wearing her cheerleading outfit. \nTRACY Oh, wow, that sucks. Further proof Carlin guys are gravy sucking pigs. \nJESSE Yeah. \nTRACY Need a ride? \nJESSE You goin' to Mark's? \nTRACY Wouldn't miss it. Hop in. As he gets into her car, TRACY has one hand on the wheel, the other hanging out her window. She drops something as JESSE closes the door.

MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nRACHEL and MONICA chat with AMY and two other PATIO GIRLS. AMY takes RACHEL 's hand. \nAMY I really like your nail color. \nMONICA Check out the tattoo on her arm wild huh? \nAMY Yeah. Did that hurt? \nRACHEL No. Well, yeah, actually some. \nAMY Oh, it's just too cool. \nMONICA I'm dying to get one, but my mom would have a shit fit. \nCHUCK How many points was she? \nBRAD Four. But maybe he shoulda lost those when she offed herself. \nMARK Rach, look under Jesses's name, how many points you get? \nMONICA \n(CHEERLEADING) Two, four, six, eight-- \nAMY Who do we appreciate! RACHEL looks down JESSES's column sees-her name with thirty points next to it, then, above hers, sees TRACY with ten. \nMARK No, more than that, remember, we thought Rach was a dyke. He got extra-points for the conversion. \nBRAD points? Try thirty. RACHEL stares at the book, stunned, trying to make sense of it. \nMONICA Look at her face, this is priceless. At the front door, JESSE walks in, TRACY behind him. He looks around, hasn't seen what's going on yet. ERIC intercepts him, turning JESSE away from the TV. \nERIC Hey, man, what did the scout say? Behind Rte... THE TV SET -- between shots of players grunting, tackling and smashing into each other, longer and longer segments appear of... \nA COUPLE MAKING LOVE -- from the waist up, with thick scan lines that almost make it look surreal. It's obvious that the girl is RACHEL, and the boy is JESSE. DANCING KIDS notice what's on the TV and start to point and laugh at the set. RACHEL is completely unaware of what's going on behind her. \nMARK See, we didn't think Jess could do i so he offered to get evidence, proof that he'd scored you. \nMONICA Here comes Jesse's big play! \nMARK Lookie, lookie, Rachel. RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her, then laughing at her. She turns and sees... The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV. Her face goes slack with horror. \nRACHEL Oh, God MARK leans in to RACHEL, who hasn't noticed JESSE. \nMARK Jess was disappointed with the picture quality, but I told him it was better than Pam and Tommy Lee's tape. \nCK Rach, was it good for you too? Sure looks like it, don't it? \nMARK Why don't we ask Jesse? He turns and calls out. \nMARK (CONT'D) Hey, Jesse! Over here! JESSE looks over and his eyes meet RACHEL's, but she just stares back, horrified. Then he sees the TV set behind her \nJESSE What... JESSE pushes his way through the crowd, trying to get to RACHEL. TRACY throws an arm around him, kisses his neck. \nTRACY He told me he was thinking of me when he fucked you. \nSeeing MARK laughing, JESSE realizes what's going on. \nJESSE Rachel... He tries to shrug off TRACY, but ERIC and CHUCK grab his arms and pull him back into the crowd. \nJESSE Rachel! MARK pushes RACHEL towards BRAD. \nMARK Rachel! Rachel! She tries to get away, but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting. Rachel! \nMONICA Rachel! Rachel! Drowning out JESSE's cries. RACHEL's P.Q.V. -- spinning around. A NIGHTMARISH GALLERY of dancing, jostling torsos, TWISTED FACES and LAUGHING MOUTHS, smirking and pointing at her. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nFAST CLOSE-UPS of RACHEL and JESSE making love. The assault of music, chanting and images crescendo with... BRAD grabbing RACHEL's bare arm below her HEART-THORN TATTOO forcing her to face the TV screen. \nBRAD Hey, is that a zit on your ass? RACHEL has tears streaming down her face for the first time since she was four years old. She bows her head. \nA LAUGHING BRAD glances down at RACHEL's arm. The THORN VINE around the HEART TATTOO looks bigger, edging up her arm. He looks away, shares a laugh with MARK, looks back and... \nTHE HEART TATTOO on RACHEL's upper arm is growing, etched from within, the thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm. \nHis eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees RACHEL standing over him. He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it. RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold, splashing into the pool. But she jolts on two... \nGUNSHOTS RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt with his pinned hand and fired. She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood. MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers. He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a mechanical whirring, and turns. A POOL COVER starts to unfold. At that moment... \nRACHEL'S BLOODY ARM bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool. \nUNDERWATER -- As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting out the light from above. MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but the POOL COVER blocks his escape. He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as his feet kick to keep him afloat. \nON THE SURFACE -- The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg, slides, then clutches at the edge of the pool. His fingers slip under as the cover completely shuts. \nM RX's head bulges the POOL COVER, then his hands punch feebly at it a few times. Then... nothing. \nBARBARA (O.S.) Rachel! A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA. RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared little girl reaching for her mother. \nRACHEL Mama. Maury? BARBARA'S P.O.V. o but it's a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, pristine, without tattoos. BARBARA blinks and her P.O.V. is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, reaching for her. Mama, please. BARBARA blinks and it's now... The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, covered in blood and tattoos. She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror. \nBARBARA What are you? You're not my little girl. No. The devil's in you. \nRACHEL \n(CRYING) Don't leave me, mama. But her mother disappears into the shadows. \nRACHEL Please, I don't have... anyone. She rolls onto her back, looks up at the STARRY NIGHT. \nRACHEL Please, God, let me die... And she tightly shuts her eyes. \nDISSOLVE BACK TO: \nTHE LIVING ROOM A vision of hell -- crimson-stained walls and piled bodies. The fire is spreading, licking its way across the burning SCOREBOARD NOTEBOOK, and along the floor toward... JESSE, in pain, still pinned to the wall. He raises his head and starts in fear as... o the center of the room, facing him. He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her gaze to... \nTHE TV SET with a cracked screen, but still playing the tape of their intimate moment at the cabin, with a sleeping RACHEL laying \nON JESS He looks back at her. \nJESSE Rachel, listen. I swear, d know they were taping us. d never hurt you. She looks at his pleading eyes. \nJESSE \nI LOVE-- The TV SET now has the video footage of... \nINT. THE CABIN - NIGHT \nJESSE looks at RACHEL clinging to him, asleep, peaceful. He gently runs his fingers across her brow. \nJESSE \n(SOFTLY) I love you . And oulls her closer. \nHACK TO -- - RACHEL staring at the TV. And the VCR rewinds and replays.. ON TV -- the moment of JESSE saying 'I love you\" to her while she was asleep. \nRACHEL falls to her knees, tears running down her face. She turns back to JESSE, amazed. A BLAZING CHUNK of ceiling falls near her. \nJESSE \n(COUGHS) Rachel. Gat out, now. Go. And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him. He falls to the floor, drags himself over... and takes RACHEL in his arms. He cradles her. She whispers and he bends over to hear. She whispers again... \nRACHEL .love you. JESSE tenderly kisses her lips. And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body Love. Her face is serene. JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's nightmare. JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the back windows, but stumbles and goes down. Her eyes flutter open. \nRACHEL Leave. Get out Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve of his jacket catches flames. And he accepts his fate. RACHEL shuts her eyes, gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH... \nEXT.

She takes it. 3i2! The SHOCK of static electricity. Their words are simultaneous. \nRACHEL Dry weather. \nJESSE Acrylic sweater. They both laugh. Then go quiet. Then just stare at each other. Then the moment is gone. RACHEL gets out of the car, through the gate, back inside her house. JESSE watches her go. Starts his engine, and his car \nWIPES THE FRAME TO: \nEXT.

Do you know what Lisa was referring to? \nRACHEL (after a moment) Yesterday morning, she told me she'd, uh, lost her virginity. KELTON looks at SUE, produces the photo of LISA with ERIC. \nKELTON You recognize this boy? \nRACHEL Sure. Eric Stark. He's on the team. KELTON gestures to SUE and they step out into... \nTHE HALLWAY with another \"Heat Carlin!\" banner in the background. \nKELTON What do you think? \nSUE Robbie, I had a Freshman crying in the hall last week. I couldn't get anything out of her, but her friend told me a football player slept with her, then dumped her. \nKELTON Nothing illegal about breaking a girl's heart. \nSUE Eric's 18. Lisa was 15.

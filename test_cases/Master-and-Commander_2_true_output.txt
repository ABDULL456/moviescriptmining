JACK Where away? 
CALAMY points forward and a little to the left of the Surprise's bow. 
CALAMY Not two miles distant, Sir. 
JACK and PULLINGS stare through telescopes into the fog, which is beginning to lift. JACK lowers his telescope. 
JACK Mr. Hollom? 
HOLLOM I saw nothing, nor heard anything either. Shall I ask them men to stand down? 
JACK steps closer to the bow, and again lifts his telescope. 
29. TELESCOPE P.O.V 
A slow pan across the sea, past a darker patch of fog. What was that? The lens pans back toward the darker area to see a series of flashes. 30. CLOSE ON JACK 
He turns and shouts to the crew - 
JACK Lie down! Everybody lie down! 
His words are underscored by a series of distant explosions, followed by a deep rumble, then a tearing, howling sound. 
31. ANGLE ON THE SKY 
Chain shot and grape, bar and canister shriek through the air. A blizzard of iron. 
32. ON THE DECK 
The crew hit the deck, the last to drop is BONDEN hanging grimly to the wheel. 
33. MIDSHIPMAN BLAKENEY 
Close, as he tries to bury himself in the deck timbers. 
34. DELETED 
35. DELETED. 
36. QUARTERDECK 
The broadside hits the bows and a cloud of splinters and metal scythes the length of the deck at head height. This is rapidly followed by billowing smoke from a small fire now burning on the forecastle. 
CALAMY is working at putting the fire out as JACK issues a stream of orders. 
JACK Run out the guns! Marines to the tops, and get that wounded man below! 
He pulls a gold watch from his pocket and checks the time. 
36A.   GUN DECK 
Hollom is nervously supervising a gun crew which includes DAVIES and his mates. HOLLOM ...C-cast loose now... Um swab. That's right. Run out your guns. 
The men work as a team, largely ignoring Hollom's hesitant instructions. The shot rack is empty 
DAVIES Shot. There's no shot! 
37.   QUARTERDECK (CONTD) 
As red-coated marines led by Captain HOWARD climb into the rigging JACK calls to his clerk - 
JACK Note the time Mr. Watt. 
An anxious TOM PULLINGS appears. 
PULLINGS She's out of our range, Sir! 
JACK calls to his sailing master, ALLEN. 
JACK Closer, Mr. ALLEN. You must lay me alongside her at pistol-shot. 
ALLEN purses his lips. He knows what he's doing and slightly resents the instruction 
JACK (CONT'D) Mr. Pullings - bow-chasers to fire as she bears. 
38. P.O.V. ENEMY SHIP 
She's crossing their bows, about a mile distant. 
39. ON DECK 
PULLINGS is racing up the larboard gangway to the forecastle, past men stacking hammocks as blast protection. 
40. ON THE FORECASTLE 
Gun-captains stand ready, the slow-match burning in the tubs.

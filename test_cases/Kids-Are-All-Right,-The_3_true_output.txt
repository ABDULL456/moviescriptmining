This is Jules' break-point. NIC What are you talking about? 
JULES Oh come on! You hated it when I worked! You wanted me at home, taking care of the kids. You wanted a wife! 
NIC That is just not true! 
JULES You didn't trust any of those nannies! And you sure as hell didn't back my career! 
NIC What are you talking about? I just helped you start another business! JULES Yeah, so you can feel better about yourself! NIC No, so you can feel better about yourself! 
JULES Are you even attracted to me anymore? 
The BARTENDER holds out the bottle of Cabernet. BARTENDER Do you still want this? 
NIC No. Just the check please. 
JULES AND PAUL 
Fucking again in his bedroom. Jules writhes beneath him, her eyes closed.   Paul seems to be in some kind of zone. He stares at her, enthralled. 
CUT TO: 
POST - COITUS 
Jules and Paul lie naked in the bed. Jules slithers around the covers, stoned on post-coital endorphins. 
JULES God, I feel so drugular right now. (sitting up quickly) I really want a cigarette! Do you have any? I haven't had a cigarette since Laser was born. Do you smoke? PAUL Sometimes. But I don't have any here. Want me to run to the store? 
JULES (bouncing off the walls) Yeah. Wait, no. Don't.     Sorry. 
Jules pops up on her knees, getting in his face. JULES (CONT'D) Do you think I'm just like some sad- sack middle-aged lesbian? 
PAUL God, that's it. I was trying to figure out how to describe you to my friends. Thank you. 
Jules punches his arm, mock hurt. They start rough-housing. Then kissing. Then the phone rings. 
JULES You want to get that? PAUL No. I want to get this... 
Paul grabs a handful of Jules' ass. Jules throws her leg over Paul and climbs up for another round. Suddenly, Joni's voice echoes through the machine. JONI (ON MACHINE) Hi Paul. It's Joni. I just wanted to apologize for my friend, Sasha. I was really embarrassed when she put her hand on your-- 
Paul grabs the receiver. PAUL Hey, Joni.     I'm here... 
Jules visibly recoils. PAUL (CONT'D) Listen, don't worry about your friend. Jules pales. She mouths: "What are you doing?!"    Paul gesticulates: "I'm sorry!" 
PAUL (CONT'D) No. Honestly. I didn't even notice... 
Jules throws on her clothes and starts to leave. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Hey, Joni?     Can you hold on a second?

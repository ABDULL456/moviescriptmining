ELAINE 
(SOLIDARITY NOD) Then we have to call Steve. And they get offended. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY 
Roger waits at the counter. Talks to CAMERA. 
ROGER Let me tell you something. If I had a dollar for every time I heard "Steve's" name, I could hire somebody better than Steve, just to shake things up. Get her one of these old semi-retired guys - someone from the pre-steroid days, with the hairy shoulders, and the butt crack. They won't be so quick to call him every ten minutes. The Clerk comes back. Hands over a 53-piece TOOL SET. 
CLERK Remember. Keep these away from anything magnetic. 
ROGER 
(WINKS) Got it. He takes the tool kit from the Clerk and drops it. The Clerk watches Roger chase down all the parts: what a dolt. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
Roger puts the tool set in his trunk...then stops. 
ROGER The thing is - I missed out. (turns to CAMERA) It's like everyone else was there the day they taught all this stuff. How to look inside acar.Or a furnace. Or a rocketship.But the guys like Steve, youknow.They were born knowing allthis- and now they're laughing. 
(MORE) 
ROGER (CONT'D) They all go down to the Competent Guys' Tavern and compare notes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COMPETENT GUYS' TAVERN - DAY 
VANS and PICKUP TRUCKS just like Steve's are parked outside. A STEVE LOOKALIKE gets out and goes in, greeting ANOTHER STEVE also arriving. LAUGHTER pours out from inside. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Steve rings the bell. Elaine tries opening the door. 
ELAINE (on other side) I'm sorry - the door's stuck. 
STEVE I can fix that. He checks it out, taps it in one place and opens the door. Elaine steps aside, enchanted -- -- as Roger drives up and sees this. And the pain in his heart is something we can feel. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S BASEMENT - DAY 
Power's back on. Steve pulls the cover off the HVAC assembly. Roger is sorting through the 53-piece tool set he bought and has no idea what to do with. 
STEVE If you've got a minute, sir. I'd like to show you something. 
ROGER (holds up tool kit) Should I bring these? 
STEVE That won't be -- (then as all the parts 
FALL OUT) -- necessary. 
ROGER

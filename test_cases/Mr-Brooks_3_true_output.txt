MR. SMITH No... I wondered that when I heard what happened, but... no. (looks at his watch) I'm sorry, I'm meeting someone and I don't want to be late. 
He moves into the Hallway closing the door behind him. 
(CONTINUED)

DETECTIVE ATWOOD Here's my card, if you hear anything or remember anything. 
MR. SMITH (taking the card) I wish I could be of more help, but sorry. 
Watching him walk away amid the crinkle of his raincoat, Detective Atwood, maybe because of her woman's intuition or maybe because she's a good cop, wonders what is in that manila envelope under his arm. 
The thought is gone almost as soon as it comes and she faces about to the next door. 
EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT 
Hunched against the rain, Mr. Smith is acutely aware of the traffic. His eyes strain to see the Occupants of each passing car. He doesn't give a second thought to the older non- descript Toyota parked against the far curb. 
INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks is in the driver's seat. Marshall is in the back. They're both tracking the progress of Mr. Smith. 
MR. BROOKS He looks clean. He looks like he's alone. 
MARSHALL No, I'm telling you he wants to do this. 
MR. BROOKS I guess I should turn around and go pick him up. 
MARSHALL Nah. Just honk. Maybe he'll get killed crossing the street and save us the mess of doing it. 
EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT 
Honk!! Honk!! Mr. Smith looks around. He's not sure that sound was for him. But when the Toyota honks again and flashes it's lights, Mr. Smith waves and splashes to the center of the street. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Even though he stops to let it pass, a car sounds its horn and swerves to avoid him. Mr. Smith crosses behind the Toyota and opens the passenger door. 
INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Smith flops into the seat. 
MR. SMITH Woof! It's really coming down out there. 
MR. BROOKS They say it'll be sunny tomorrow. 
Mr. Smith fumbles with the buttons and zipper on his raincoat. 
MR. SMITH I never trust those guys, when they say it's going to be clear it always rains and when they say it's going to rain, it's sunny. 
He comes up with the manila envelope. 
MR. SMITH Here's what you asked for. 
Mr. Brooks takes it and hefts it. 
MR. BROOKS The pictures and the memory card all here? 
MR. SMITH Yeah. 
MR. BROOKS You and I both know that not all the pictures are in here and you made a copy of the Memory Card, isn't that so? 
MR. SMITH But you understand my position. 
Mr. Brooks favors him with a wolfish smile. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROOKS Yes, I do. But it's my hope that once you get to know me better you'll feel comfortable in giving me all that I've asked for. 
MR. SMITH That sounds fair. Oh, I almost forgot. I thought you might be interested in this. 
His hand comes forward with a card. 
MR. SMITH It's the policewoman who's looking for you. 
Marshall snaps forward from the back seat. 
MARSHALL Wow! We've never known anyone who's looking for us before. 
Mr. Brooks pinches the rectangle of paper away from Mr. Smith for a closer view. 
MARSHALL We've got to find out everything there is to know about this woman. 
MR. BROOKS This is too close, Marshall, too damn close. 
Mr. Smith interrupts Mr. Brooks's focus on Detective Atwood's card. 
MR. SMITH So, what do we do now? What's the plan for the evening? 
Mr. Brooks slips the envelope under the seat and starts the car. 
MR. BROOKS We drive around until we see someone we think we might enjoy killing.

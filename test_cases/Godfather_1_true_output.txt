CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing. 
SONNY beats him mercilessly. 
Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become spectators. 
SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into CARLO's face and body. 
CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, other than hang onto the railing. 
SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands; even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go. 
It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him more; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO. 
SONNY You...bastard...You...hurt my sister... again...and I'll kill...you. 
He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly. and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially interested. 
CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps onto the stoop. 
---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- 
FADE IN: 
EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946) 
HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day. Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of various points around the main house and compound.  Things have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new and secure gate house has been built.  Security measures that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval Fortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the result of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the crater is damaged by fire. 
A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the shelter of the gate house. 
They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they call the main house. 
KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still runs down onto her face. 
She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN. 
TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her. 
HAGEN Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call... 
KAY I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael. 
HAGEN Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all. 
KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with rainwater. 
KAY What was that? 
HAGEN An accident.  No one was hurt. 
KAY Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one? 
TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has to. 
HAGEN Sure...I'm sorry. 
They hurry through the rain and into the Main House. 
INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946) 
In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and takes her rainhat off. 
KAY Will you give this to him. 
HAGEN If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you. 
We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her. 
MAMA You're Mikey's little girl. 
KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes. 
MAMA You eat anything? 
KAY shakes her head. 
MAMA (to HAGEN) Disgrazia, you don't even give the poor girl a cup of coffee? 
HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves toward MAMA, the letter extended. 
KAY Will you give this letter to Michael. 
HAGEN Mama, no. 
MAMA You tell me what to do?  Even he don't tell me what to do. 
She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved. 
KAY Why did they blame Michael? 
MAMA You listen to me, you go home to your family, and you find a good young man and get married.  Forget about Mikey; he's no good for you, anymore. 
She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what that means. 
EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946) 
A hospital in New York City.  POLICE and teams of PRIVATE DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.  An ambulance with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying the DON. 
TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing up the rear.  HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a moment they disappear behind the ambulance.  Then suddenly, siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung cars.

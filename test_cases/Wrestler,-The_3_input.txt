RANDY'S POV: A huge, dark-skinned man in khakis and a BOB ZAYID PONTIAC polo is talking to SOME OTHER WRESTLER. This is THE AYATOLLAH (52). 
THE AYATOLLAH That makes two in Columbus, one in Dayton. Next 12 months, I'd say Cincy's not out of the question. 
OTHER WRESTLER (not too interested) Wow... 
The Ayatollah looks up and sees Randy looking at him. 
THE AYATOLLAH Ram-A-Lam. 
Randy heads over. 
RANDY (shakes Ayatollah's hand) What's up, Bob? (shakes other guy's hand) Yo, Carl. 
THE AYATOLLAH Good to see ya, bro. Didn't think we were gonna do this. 
RANDY Yeah, well, I'm here. 
THE AYATOLLAH Thursday night, I get a call, "It's on! He's back in!" I'm like "What?" 
The Ayatollah chortles. 
RANDY When you get settled in, we should go over things. 
THE AYATOLLAH What things? 
RANDY Y'know, the spots. 
THE AYATOLLAH Ah, we can just wing it. 
RANDY You don't wanna hash it out? 
The Ayatollah gives him a dismissive, cavalier wave. 
THE AYATOLLAH It'll be fine. 
RANDY We should have at least a basic plan. 
THE AYATOLLAH How's this: I'm the heel, you're the face. Done. 
The Ayatollah chuckles. Randy walks off, highly annoyed. 
THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (CONT'D) (to other wrestler) Anyway, if you're ever in Ohio, swing on by. I'll make you a nice deal on a G6. 
INT. GAS STATION - SHORT TIME LATER 
Cassidy pulls into a gas station. She rolls down the window. 
CASSIDY Excuse me. 
A GAS STATION ATTENDANT looks her way. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) Do you know where the Civic Auditorium is? 
INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
The card is underway. Through a wall, we hear the muffled sounds of a MATCH IN PROGRESS: cheers, boos, crashes, etc. 
Randy, sitting alone on a bench in just his jock strap, tapes up his legs. His focus and intensity builds. 
EXT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER 
Cassidy pulls into the lot. There's a lot more cars than when Randy pulled in. 
INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - OUTER CONCOURSE - SHORT TIME LATER 
The building's outer concourse. A handful of fans mill about at a CONCESSIONS STAND and a SOUVENIR TABLE. 
Cassidy, handing a ticket to an USHER, enters the building. She looks around the concourse, not quite sure where to go. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
Randy, suited up in his tights, paces the floor, gearing himself up for the match. The only other wrestler in the locker room at the moment is The Ayatollah, doing neck rolls nearby. Randy catches his eyes. 
RANDY Ready to do this? 
Through the wall, ARABIC MUSIC starts to play. 
THE AYATOLLAH Believe so. 
The Ayatollah grabs a large IRANIAN FLAG leaning against the lockers. He heads toward an ENTRANCE CURTAIN, Randy close behind. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (through curtain) From the Islamic Republic of Iran, weighing in at 252 pounds... The Tehran Terror, the Beast Of The Middle East... (BEAT) The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah! 
The Ayatollah steps through the curtain, Iranian flag raised high. He is promptly greeted with LUSTY BOOS. 
INT. OUTER CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS 
Cassidy is walking around the concourse with a mounting sense urgency. She spots a SECURITY GUY in a yellow windbreaker sitting by an UNMARKED DOOR. She heads toward him. 
CASSIDY Excuse me. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Randy is peering through the narrow gap in the curtain, watching The Ayatollah make his entrance. 
THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (faint, amidst the boos) Death to America!

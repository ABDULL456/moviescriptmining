MARVIN Annex skywalk...? Sounds like the pissant World's Fair... He rummages around, finds a big wrinkled MAP, smoothes it out. 
MARVIN(CONT'D) Lemme see... yeah, must be this... connects to the new terminal - Marvin points to an ELEVATED WALKWAY connecting the two complexes.

107 CONTINUED - 107 
MCCLANE (looking at map) Shit, it's a fucking bottleneck. Anybody smart enough to shut down the airport is smart enough to figure this... it's a perfect place for an ambush...

108 INT. TERMINAL ENGINEERING OFFICE - NIGHT 108 
Barnes, nervous, throws things into a metal case. His fellow engineers watch, curious, as he EXITS with the FIVE SWAT COPS. CAMERA FOLLOWS the four men past - 
A) BANKS OF COMPUTERS - 
B) COMPUTERIZED WEATHER MAPS - 
C) AN L.E.D. DULLES MAP - all of it useless, all of the operators watching their only hope Barnes. 
CUT TO: 
109 BASEMENT 109 A MOUND of CRINKLED PAPERS is FLATTENED against the card table. We WIDEN, see it is an architect's PLANS of the entire Dulles netherworld, cribbed by Marvin and now festooned with his various multi-color jotes and notes. 
MARVIN Now, see? Here's you. And here's the skywalk. 
(POINTING) Now, check this out... 
MCCLANE Tunnels. 
MARVIN 
(NODDING) Like the Japs had all over Iwo Jima. That's where I got wounded. But we put those little twerps in their place once and for all. (pointing to the map) These are air ducts for all the terminals. Heating, cooling. Whole shebang.

109 CONTINUED - 109 MARVIN (Cont'd)- So I put you in the boiler room where they start, and you come out there. 
MCCLANE Looks like... maybe a mile. Easy jog. 
MARVIN 
(AMUSED) Uh-uh. It's a pisser of a crawl. And that's the easy part; firs you gotta be an acrobat. 
110 INT. BASEMENT -- DUCT ACCESS 110 
With a cordless drill, Marvin unhinges the access door. Last bolt, it falls with a sheet-metal SLAM. McClane WINCES as a BLAST of AIR hits him - and, as. perspiration breaks out on his forehead, we realize it's hot air. 
MCCLANE Whoa. 
MARVIN Winter up there... Summer down here. He aims Marvin's flashlight down there, isn't enchanted with what he sees. He turns, takes Marvin's map. 
MCCLANE(CONT'D) I owe you one, Marvin. How about a sixpack of malt liquor? 
MARVIN How 'bout a case of Johnny Walker? (on McClane's look) Hey, I may be homeless, but I ain't tasteless. 
CUT TO: 
111 INT. LONG TERMINAL GALLERY - NIGHT 111 
A big "history of flight" MURAL high on the wall here HALF FINISHED, ceilings PARTIALLY OPEN; A WORKER on the scaffold and THREE OTHERS on the floor still hammering and. fiddling. Barnes and the cops come in. Barnes looks OUT the WINDOWS here

BARNES (into his cellular phone) We're in the annex skywalk. I can see the dish! I'll call you as soon as it's hot for a protocol test.

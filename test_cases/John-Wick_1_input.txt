-driving down narrow service alleys with reckless abandon- 
-and going against traffic, steering with an apt hand. 
Eventually, John creates enough mayhem to tie up the police on the ground- 
-leaving the helicopter overhead. 
On a long stretch of road, John reaches the vehicle's top speed, reaches down, flips open a hidden compartment, and presses a button for- 
-his NITROUS OXIDE SYSTEM- 
-which causes the engine to SCREAM, roaring down the road at an incredible speed- 
-distancing himself from the helicopter to eventually hide in an abandoned warehouse. 
He parks... 
...and walks across the street to the local diner... 
...as overhead, the police chopper searches in vain.

FADE TO: 
EXT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS 
The floor is empty, the building quiet. 
INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - THE MAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Sitting at his desk, Aurelio -a cigarette dangling from between his lips- works on a model car, carefully gluing pieces together. 
The bottle of Campari rests nearby.     Music plays softly from a radio nearby. 
The phone rings.     Aurelio takes a deep breath, exhales, and answers it. 
AURELIO This is Aurelio. 
VIGGO (O.S.) I hear you've struck my son. 
AURELIO (deep breath, sighs) Yes, sir. I did. 
VIGGO (O.S.) Might I ask why? 
AURELIO Because he stole John Wick's car. 
Silence. 
VIGGO (a long beat, then) Oh. 
AURELIO And Viggo? 
VIGGO Yes? 
AURELIO Your son killed his dog. 
VIGGO (a long beat, then) Good evening, Aurelio. 
Click - the line goes dead. 
Aurelio refills his drink... and chuckles with a shake of his head. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. A TOWNHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
SUPER:   MANHATTAN, NEW YORK 
A resplendent home in one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods. 
A trio of military-grade SEDANS -heavily armored, tinted/bulletproof glass, intimidating- pull up to the curb. The first and third empty as the keen eyes of ten gunmen scour the street, buildings, and rooftops. 
A beat... and one of them slaps a hand on the middle Sedan's roof. 
Preceded -and proceeded- by a gunman, IOSEF emerges; belligerently naive and yet... scared. 
INT. A TOWNHOUSE - THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
Lighting himself a cigarette, VIGGO TARASOV -60s, face scarred by a hard life, one eye dead, hair perfectly coifed, expensive suit, a slight limp, relying on a cane- fills a tumbler with ice. 
He selects a fresh bottle of JEWEL OF RUSSIAN CLASSIC VODKA and twisting off the cap, hesitating. Deciding otherwise, Viggo dumps out the ice, pours himself a double shot, and slams it back...

She kisses him, kisses her hand and pats it to Burns' cheek. 
HILDY So long, husbands. 
She goes. 
TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY 
leaving. She weaves just a bit. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN 
They look after her. 
BRUCE (smiling a little) I never knew Hildy to be so determined before. 
BURNS You haven't seen anything yet. 
Bruce turns to look at Burns -- they look at each other. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG - DAY CLOSE SHOT AT TELEPHONE 
It is ringing. A hand comes in to take the phone. CAMERA DRAWS BACK A LITTLE to show Endicott taking the phone. He has an eye shade over his eyes and five cards in his other hand. 
ENDICOTT (into phone) Criminal Courts Press Room... This is Endicott... No, nothing new on the Williams case yet boss. Well, you bet I'm here plugging away every minute. (hangs up and studies his cards) Up a dime. 
CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to reveal the other players as they speak. Playing are reporters Murphy, Endicott, Wilson, Schwartz and McCue. 
MURPHY (dropping his cards) By me. 
WILSON (also dropping) Droparoo. 
Schwartz knocks on table and drops cards. 
MCCUE (reluctantly) I'll call. 
ENDICOTT Three sixes. Is that any good? 
HILDY'S VOICE It sure looks good from here. 
The boys all look up toward sound of Hildy's voice. 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY JOHNSON 
framed in the doorway. She is carrying a bag and has changed her costume to a tailored travelling suit. She grins and comes into the room. 
MED. SHOT REPORTERS 
They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene. There are ad libs of "Hildy!" "Where'd you come from?" "Holy Mackeral, Hildy Johnson!", etc. Hildy raises her hand for silence. 
HILDY One at a time, boys. 
She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk, takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag. All through the above action she is talking rapidly. 
HILDY No, I'm not back for good. I'm just covering the Earl Williams story for Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack of something but will be all right by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up with Walter Burns -- far from it! As a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight for Albany and I'll be married tomorrow morning. The lucky man is Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in the insurance business -- and when I say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are there any other questions? 
Hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the stockings she is wearing, sees she has a run and takes a fresh pair out of the bag. She sits down and begins to put on the new stockings. 
ENDICOTT (grinning) Well, that about covers everything. 
HILDY Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun? 
MURPHY If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes. 
MCCUE It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job. (waving his hand toward Wilson) Take it away, Fred Wilson! 
WILSON Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding. (gesturing toward Schwartz) Come in, Dave Schwartz. 
SCHWARTZ His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all. 
HILDY Thanks, boys. That's all I want to know. 
Hildy gets up, rolls the pair of stockings she has just discarded into a ball, crosses to Bensinger's desk and puts the stockings in a drawer. 
ENDICOTT Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk. 
HILDY I know, I just want to give him a thrill. 
Hildy crosses back to desk and sits down. 
HILDY All right, boys, now that everything is settled, deal me in. 
Hildy glances toward clock on wall. The hands show 2:45 PM. 
INSERT: CLOCK - Hands pointing to 2:45 PM. 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY 
She picks up phone nearest her on desk and starts to dial, picking up cards dealt her with one hand. 
HILDY (into phone) Hello, this is Hildy Johnson. Get me Walter Burns. (she studies her cards -- then, into phone) Hello, Walter. How's the old double- crosser? 
CLOSE SHOT WALTER BURNS 
Telephone at his ear. 
BURNS Hello, my fine-feathered friend. Thought I might be hearing from you. What have you got to report? 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT and we see that Burns is stripped to the waist. A doctor is applying a stethoscope to his chest. We HOLD the picture a second: Burns listening intently on the phone and the doctor listening intently to his chest. 
BURNS (into phone) Going all right, eh? 
DOCTOR (nodding) Fine. 
Doctor suddenly realizes what he's said and looks up. 
BURNS (putting hand over mouthpiece of phone) Doctor, will you please keep quiet a minute? How do you expect me to get any work done? 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bruce, who has some papers in front of him at the desk. Bruce grins. 
DOCTOR How do you expect me to get anywhere if you're going to keep on that phone? If you'll just give me two minutes more -- 
BURNS (into phone) Well, they haven't finished with me yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of condition. They found two new dimples. 
CUT TO:

cards in her other hand. 
HILDY How about that check? All right, Mr. Burns, but remember, no checkee -- no story. Well, as soon as they decide whether you live or not will you have that new man of mine call me up? Yes, sir. (she hangs up) All right, boys. Up a dime. 
ENDICOTT'S VOICE Right back at you. 
MED. SHOT

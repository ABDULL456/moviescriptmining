CARRIE Shit! 
PRYCE He's got nowhere to go, nowhere to hide. 
Then it hits her -- 
CARRIE He won't try.    He's a goddamn pilot. 
As the two of them take off for the door -- 
INT. ASB - HANGAR - DAY 
Delfy walks across the floor. Hangar is minimally lit. Still. Silent. Void of personnel. The Otters are lined up. The Snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side. He heads toward an Otter. 
INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGAR - DAY 
Delfy reaches in and gets his son's picture, which is still hanging on the console. Then, something catches his attention through the windshield of his plane. He sees a FUEL HOSE running to another plane -- and it's pumping. 
Curious, he gets out of the Otter. Eyes dart about the hangar. Doesn't see anyone. Heads to the other plane. Discovers that a door is open on the other side. Takes a another look around. Doesn't see anyone. Moves closer. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Gets to the plane.   Takes a look inside, and -- 
THUD!   He's nailed with a giant Crescent wrench to the head.   Stumbles back. 
Keller leaps out, grabbing hold of a staggering Delfy. 
Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool chest. Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap. Unconscious. 
EXT. ASB - HEADING TOWARD THE HANGAR - RIGHT AFTER 
Carrie and Pryce, dressed in ECW are making their way toward the hangar. 
INT. LC-130 - SAME 
Employees are trudging up through the back entrance into the plane. Get checked off a list by the LOAD MASTER. Toss their gear into a netted cargo area. Find a seat. Plane is nearly full. 
INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGER 
Keller has the engine going. It's loud. Preps the console for flight, flipping switches -- suddenly sees Carrie and Pryce enter the hangar. Guns drawn. 
CARRIE AND PRYCE 
Shift their attention to the plane.    Blades turning. They stalk forward. Slowly. Carefully.      Eyeing for any betrayal of movement. 
Then, with a nod from Carrie, they move in. Fast. Ready. Look into the plane. It's empty, except for a duffle bag in the back. Carrie nods to Pryce. Motions for him to go one way, she'll go another. 
INTERCUT CARRIE AND PRYCE Carrie eyeballs a Snowcat. It's door is slightly open. She heads for it. Gun poised. 
Pryce moves to check the next plane.    Eyes dart to every dark corner. 
Carrie gets to the Cat.    Springs toward the door. Inside's empty. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Pryce walks under THE WING of the next plane. Spots Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest. Looks like he's stirring into consciousness. Then -- 
SWOOSH!! An ICE AXE swings down from above, embedding in his Pryce's chest. Deep. It sticks. Gun goes flying. Keller drops down from the wing above. Pryce staggers. Keller kicks him hard. 
Pryce goes down.   Keller grabs the gun. 
Points it right at Pryce -- before he can shoot -- 
BANG!BANG! Bullets zip by Keller, who rolls for cover behind SOME EQUIPMENT. Another rips into his shoulder. 
Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat. She fires continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. The shots go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right hand. 
Keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots back, which -- 
-- Gives Pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover beneath the plane. He's losing blood quick. 
Carrie keeps shooting. Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST. They stop. Carrie has to reload. 
Keller makes his move. Fires at Carrie and sprints for his plane. Runs right by pole with a large red button attached to it. Slams it. 
HANGAR DOORS BEGIN TO RUMBLE OPEN 
The TEMPERATURE immediately begins to PLUMMET as winter is let inside. 
Keller keeps shooting.   Runs out of bullets.   Leaps into the idling Otter. 
Carrie makes her move.   Dashes toward him, firing away.

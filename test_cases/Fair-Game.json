(hearing the front door) I gotta go. \nHe hangs up. Valerie enters. The twins run out of the lounge towards her. She goes into mom mode. \nVALERIE Hey guys.

He denied that his wife had any role in it whatsoever, but a memo Plame wrote on February 12, 2002 proves otherwise. \nMSNBC NEWS FOOTAGE \nANCHORMAN The Senate Intelligence Committee let some air \u00ad a lot of air - out of Joe Wilson's overly inflated ego when it issued its first report on prewar intelligence. While the committee heaped most of its criticism on the Central Intelligence Agency for getting almost everything wrong about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction it pointedly rebuked the former ambassador and his infamous mission to Niger. \nEXT. HOUSE. DAY. \nMorning. Joe, in a suit, comes out of his house. A gaggle of reporter is waiting, they follow Joe as he crosses into the street towards his car. Shutters and flashbulbs firing. \nREPORTER Mr Wilson, do you still maintain the Vice President's office sent you Niger and not your wife? \nREPORTER 2 Mr Wilson was Niger just a free holiday? A boondoggle? \nJOE WILSON My wife did not send me. I didn't receive payment. It was not a holiday. It was a fact finding mission in the run up to a war. But the fact is no one wanted facts. \nREPORTER Are you against our troops Mr Wilson? \nREPORTER Mr. Wilson is it true you donated money to the Kerry campaign? \nREPORTER People are saying your wife does not actually work for the CIA. \nREPORTER Is it true she was just a secretary at Langley? \nJoe turns round, furious, as if he's going to punch the reporter. He tenses his jaw. \nJOE WILSON No comment. \nJoe gets into his car. The questions roaring around him. \nINT. HOUSE. NIGHT. \nValerie is alone. In bed. Watching TV. FOX NEWS. Rogers. \nGUEST The question still remains, who is Valerie Plame? Was she really simply a glorified typist? \nROGERS Well, I think it's really all about the money. We're talking about a third-rate CIA agent who had a government salary, and she had sent her husband to Niger, and he had come back and didn't give the report to the CIA, but he turned it over in an op-ed to The New York Times. So she was already in the hot seat with the CIA, and so now she's all about the money. Plus it's come out that she was considered kind of a mediocre agent at best. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. \nJoe puts a sheet on the couch. He looks around for something to use as a pillow. \nINT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nJoe comes into the bedroom to get his pillow. Valerie is lying in the bed, turned away. He pauses in the doorway. \nWe see Valerie up close.

They beat us. Deprived us of sleep. All you had to do was give up the name of one of the others. Just one name. For a glass of water. A sandwich. To avoid another punch. \nFLASH -- A CAR BATTERY IS CONNECTED.. SZZZZZZ! \nVALERIE Another hour in a stress position. \nFLASH -- VALERIE bursts out from under the water. Gasps in a draft of air. \nVALERIE They push you until they find it. Til they find the point at which you break. Because they have to know. You have to know. And one by one, everybody broke. Except me. I never broke. (she looks at him) I've been in situations, places where I was afraid. Where if you made a mistake, one tiny mistake, at any moment.. (Pause) But I never made a mistake. And that made me feel special. I thought: I'm Different. Bullet- proof. You can't break me. I don't have a breaking point. (Pause) I was wrong. \nJoe comes over. He reaches out and touches Valerie.

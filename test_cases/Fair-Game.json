Because I promise you one thing... Right now, you have no idea what we can and cannot do. \nHafiz looks in the rear view. At the floor. Deep inside something stirred. She saw it.. \nVALERIE We need information about your uncle. Contacts. Shipments. If you help us, we help you. If you don't, your brother dies and tomorrow you're sitting next to your uncle in a cell in Thailand and it won't be me asking the questions. \nHafiz closes his eyes, head back.

(Laughter) I swear to god, he can't turn, slow down, for like four hundred yards. \nBILL And yet I'm incredible in bed. \nAT THE BAR-- JOE WILSON, handsome, 50s, watches the explosions on the screen. He picks up a tray. \nJOE Keep the change. \nBACK TO: \nValerie is being quizzed by her buddy's boyfriend, Steve. \nSTEVE So what do you do Valerie? \nVALERIE I work in Venture Capital. Brewster Jennings, here in Georgetown. \nSTEVE Cool. So like net startups..? \nVALERIE Right. Retail and consumer.. Basically we create pooled investment vehicles.. \nSTEVE Sounds high risk.. \nVALERIE I guess. But you know..high risk, high return. Pretty boring actually. So what do you do? \nJOE arrives back to the table with a tray of drinks. \nJOE                            DIANA They're out of Corona.

It's put in an unmarked container and shipped to the free trade zone in Dubai. Our asset meets there with the buyer on the 23rd. \nShe tosses a spark gap to one of her team. \nVALERIE Dr Forster and his team at Los Alamos have altered the impedence timings of the spark gaps by a fraction of a nanosecond. Basically, they won't know it doesn't work til it doesn't work. \nALI Can we put a wire on the asset? \nThe door at the back opens. The Deputy of CPD enters with the Chief. Everybody sits up.

Down the line D.F.U. \nVALERIE What about the Dubai op? \nBILL Mike says you got a hunch on the buyer. \nVALERIE Manucher Vaziri. Syrian National. Based out of Karachi. On a wire picked up in Cairo he talks about componentry from a known source in Pakistan he's moving to an unnamed Gulf state.. \nBILL Iraq? \nVALERIE Vaziri's devoutly Shia. Iraq's controlled by the Sunni. Saddam's Sunni. There's no way this is Iraq. \nBILL They're all good Muslims right? \nVALERIE And Martin Luther King and the KKK are both Christian. \nBILL Great job.

Joe, working on something, recording voice notes, half- watching the President over his papers. \nPRESIDENT V/O (ON CNN) They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred.. \nACROSS THE ROOM -- beneath a wall of well-thumbed tomes, two year old twins, TREVOR and SAMANTHA are lost in play. Trevor hauls in the flex of a globe lamp on a top shelf. \nPRESIDENT They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic. \nCRASH! -- Joe turns as the shelf GIVES WAY, and an avalanche of books and keepsakes buries his kids. Hollers. Tears. \nJOE (Rushes over) Hey hey hey. Everybody OK? Let's take a look at you. Four arms. Four legs. No broken bones. \nHe lugs them out. The front door opens. It's Heather the babysitter. \nHEATHER Hey kids! Joe I'm sorry I'm late. \nJOE That's fine. Look guys. Heather's here. \nCUT TO: \nJOE I can save the CIA some air fare here. There isn't a snowflakes chance in hell this thing happened. \nVALERIE Say who? \nJOE Says me. \nVALERIE What if you're wrong? One guy says it's true. It's not true. Lots of guys say it's true, it's still not true. It's intelligence. It's slow. Painstaking. But it works. Checks and balances. \nJOE What am I, a check or a balance? \nVALERIE Probably neither. You're a teeny tiny weeny cog in a giant machine. But you did your job. You should feel good. They count on that. That's why they don't pay you. \nJOE I'm not feeling that 007 right now. \nShe puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him sexily. \nVALERIE I can get the kids to make you a medal, if it'll help. \nJOE Us double oh's are more about the gratuitous sex. \nVALERIE I'll see what I can do. \nThey start making out. \nCUT TO: \nTELEVISION FOOTAGE OF A PRESS CONFERENCE. \nJOURNALIST Mr. President, in your speeches now you rarely talk or mention Osama bin Laden. Why is that? \nINT. CHIEF'S OFFICE. DAY \nVALERIE leans over an analyst's desk as together they study photographs of a Syrian man in his sixties on the analysts screen.. The TV is on in the corner of the computer screen.. \nPRESIDENT ON TV The idea of focusing on one person indicates people don't understand the scope of the mission. Terror is bigger than one person. So I just don't spend that much time on him, Kelly, to be honest with you... \nValerie looks up and stops. ACROSS THE FLOOR SCOOTER LIBBY, his assistant and TWO AIDES, walk past. Heads turn. \nVALERIE Why is the OVP here? \nINT. MIKE'S OFFICE. DAY. \nThe Deputy director hears a knock. It's Valerie. \nVALERIE Mike.

DAY \nValerie and Mike queue up in the mess with JIM PAVITT, 52 the Deputy Director of the CIA. \nPAVITT Relax Mike. The Veep's just dotting the i's. \nMIKE Bullshit Jim. The only time a Vice President comes to Langley is to cut a fucking ribbon. \nPAVITT Look. Cheney doesn't trust us. This shit with Dick goes back thirty years. It'll blow over. (He turns to Valerie) Where are we on Iraq? \nVALERIE Behind the curve Sir. Most of the intel is outdated. We don't have a single operative or asset in the country. \nPAVITT What about geo-satellite imaging? \nVALERIE With respect sir, you can't look at this problem from space and make a call. \nPAVITT So talk to the defectors. \nVALERIE The defectors are unreliable. Most are supplied through a former asset the agency's had on a burn notice since `95. It's a racket. They walk in and get paid to say whatever the Pentagon wants to hear. \nPAVITT So we're blind. \nVALERIE We need sources we can rely on. We need to get in close. \nVALERIE So you're not Doctor Fallari. \nPROFESSOR AZIZ Madam. I've never even heard of this man. \nVALERIE You were not lead engineer at the Osirak nuclear installation outside Tikrit. You were never captured by the Mukhbarat escaping to Syria. You didn't spend three years in the Abu Dhan jail. \nPROFESSOR AZIZ This is absurd. \nVALERIE You weren't tortured. Broken. You didn't finally escape and arrive here in Cairo with nothing. \nPROFESSOR AZIZ No. \nVALERIE Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters. They were taken by Uday Hussein's private guard. He never saw them again. \nHe stares at the floor. \nVALERIE That didn't happen. They never existed. \nHe remains motionless. Valerie watches him closely. \nVALERIE I need names. Of your colleagues in the weapons programmes. The lives of hundreds of thousands of your people may depend upon it. \nHe looks up at Valerie tears in his eyes \nVALERIE I know Tarif. I know what happened. \nHe walks over to the window. SLOWLY he takes off his jacket. His shirt, pulls it off over his head and turns his back to her. He's been mutilated and burned all up his back. Slowly he turns. Deep scars. Burns. \nPROFESSOR You know nothing. \nEXT. CAIRO STREET. DUSK. \nSunset. Traders are packing up. Valerie hurries into -- \nINT. SAFE HOUSE. CAIRO. DUSK. \n..up some rickety stairs and unlocks a graffiti covered door. Inside she takes out the notepad, her heart beating fast.

She starts to type the names into the computer. \nCUT TO: \nESTABLISHING. RAINY LANGLEY. DAY. \nINT. CHIEF OF CPD'S OFFICE. DAY. \nMIKE at his desk. His secretary pops her head round the door. \nSECRETARY They're back. \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM. DAY. \nAn analyst sits opposite Scooter Libby. He's so nervous he can barely open his eyes. \nANALYST 1 The Iraqis were trying to buy the tubes off the internet. They spent three million dollars weather- proofing the tubes. Plus the tubes are roughly twice too long. Now you could argue that that's to disguise them, you could saw them in half. That's sixty thousand tubes. (Mimes sawing) I mean whew. Saddam's gonna get the mother of all blisters.. \nLaughs. Libby stares, unsmiling. Keeps sawing. Wishing to God he'd never started. \nOUTSIDE. \nThe door opens and the analyst, white as a sheet, comes out. A couple of colleagues are waiting outside. \nANALYST 2 How was it? \nANALYST 1 Don't make jokes. \nANALYST 1 drifts his way back to his desk. ANALYST 2 swallows, and disappears into the `interrogation' room. \nINT. BATHROOM. DAY. \nPAUL, the chief analyst, comes out of the stall. ANALYST 2 is there, throwing up in the sink. \nANALYST 2 He thinks I don't know how serious it is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days, we've gone back over and over it. \nPAUL OK. I'll handle this. \nCUT TO: \nScooter listens patiently to PAUL, the chief analyst. \nPAUL And so apart from all the scepticism surrounding the specification, the analysis from the IAEA which I believe is numbered in the report.. (Stops. Changes tack) Mr Libby. Energy department nuclear scientists are among the most boring people on the planet. They can talk about gas centrifuges until you want to jump out of a window. And maybe once every ten years someone comes along and says \"so, tell me about gas centrifuges\". That's literally the only time you should listen to these guys. If they say an aluminium tube is not for a gas centrifuge it's like a fish talking about water. We've been over this data with you now five, six times. And... We don't really know how you want us to play this.. \nTACTICAL COMMANDER Say we drop in a light weight tac team outside the city. \nBILL You get through the checkpoints and roadblocks. You show up in my bedroom in the dead of the night with an armed tac team ask me to help out Uncle Sam? I'm going to react unpredictably. \nTACTICAL COMMANDER What about forcible extraction of two or three of the main targets? \nVALERIE No. We've got 29 names. I want to get to them all. \nTACTICAL     COMMANDER How? You can't use     the inspectors. You can't use tac.     The wall's too high Val. What are     you going to do. Train a mouse? \nVALERIE Maybe. \nINT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nJoe opens his eyes. Rolls across. He's alone. \nINT. KITCHEN, THE WILSON HOME.

I have to be at the airport in forty five minutes. \nJoe, still half-asleep, catches up. \nJOE Well...how long this time? I mean... Do we need childcare for tomorrow- \nVALERIE I left a post-it by the lamp. Its all on the post-it. \nJOE Right. Its on the post-it. \nVALERIE I didn't want to wake you. (Senses something) Are you OK? \nJOE We've been leaving post-its for each other for months now.. we talk via Post-It. That fridge is like a dead letter drop. (Stops. Laughs) Jesus. Listen to me!. I sound like an old... Some- (He bangs the door) I don't know where you go. Who you meet. If you're in some jail, or lying in some ditch in Jordan, Beirut. And if you go missing, I can't tell anyone because you were never there. I'd never know what happened. I don't know where you go. \nVALERIE I'm going to Cleveland. \nHe stops. Thunder-robbed. \nVALERIE I'll be home tonight. (Then) It's on the Post-It. \nShe kisses him. They look at one another. \nJOE Have a nice day. \nShe shuts the door, leaving Joe alone. He walks through to the kitchen, looks at the fridge, one by one he takes all the notes off, then, deliberately, drops them in the bin. \nINT. EMERGENCY ROOM, EUCLID CLINIC, CLEVELAND.

In the window, Valerie and Dr. Sawsan Al Haddad sip coffee. \nVALERIE How long is it since you saw your brother? \nSAWSAN 1989. I attended a medical convention over there. Before that, in `83, he came here for an engineering conference. Twice in twenty five years. We try to stay in contact. It's difficult. \nVALERIE Would you like to go back and see him? \nSAWSAN holds her gaze. \nSAWSAN You want me to become a spy. \nValerie and Ali enter the revolving doors and follow her at a distance across the shiny beige and gold marble floors. \nBy the the check in desk for the Gulf Air flight to Baghdad stand TWO MOUSTACHIOED MEN in dark suits. \nValerie and Ali have stopped in a electronic goods store. \nALI Mukhbarat. Watching the flight desk on this side. \nValerie aims her zoom lens camera and as if appraising it as a purchase, firing off some shots of the Iraqi agents. \nSawsan reaches the desk and is stopped by the two men. \nThey watch her talking to the men, handing over her passport. \nCUT TO: \nThe Iraqi agent stares at her. He asks a question in arabic No subtitles. Sawsan responds. She remains cool, almost disinterested. The men exchange sentences of arabic. \nBACK TO: \nValerie watches from a distance. Heart beating. At last they allow Sawsan through, she checks onto the flight. \nCUT TO: \nSawsan walks through to board the plane.

That there have been shipments into Iraq of high-quality aluminum tubes that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs.. \nVALERIE freezes. \nCUT TO: \nTELEVISION (REAL FOOTAGE) -- FOX NEWS SUNDAY WITH BRIT HUME \nCOLIN POWELL And as we saw in reporting just this morning, he is still trying to acquire some of the specialized aluminum tubing one needs to develop centrifuges that would give you an enrichment capability. \nCUT TO: \nTELEVISION (REAL FOOTAGE) -- MEET THE PRESS. \nRUSSERT Aluminium tubes? \nCHENEY Specifically aluminum tubes. There's a story in The New York Times this morning. I want to attribute The Times.

Valerie spots it instantly, as he broods. \nDIANA He's a threat. You can't tell me he's not a threat. \nLISA He's mad. Like Hitler. If we'd stopped Hitler in the thirties- \nJoe sits there. Fuming. \nFRED He's not Hitler. He's Saddam. We put him there. Why? It suited us. He's our fault. Always was. \nRight on cue, Joe rounds on the hapless FRED. \nJOE WILSON Have you met him? Fred. Have you met Saddam? Have you looked him in the eye? Did he threaten you? Did he threaten to kill you? You don't know Saddam. You don't know what you're talking about. \nJoe gets up.

Joe sits on stage with three academic types. In the hundred seater auditorium, just a couple dozen or so students. \nPROFESSOR Ambassador Wilson is the last American diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein. In 1990, when Saddam threatened to execute anyone sheltering foreigners, Wilson appeared at a press conference wearing a noose around his neck, declaring, \"If the choice is to allow Americans to be taken hostage or be executed, I will bring my own fucking rope.\" Saddam backed down and Wilson evacuated several thousand. He came home and was taken to the Oval Office where the President introduced him to the War Cabinet as an American hero. \nJOE That's not quite true. It wasn't the Oval Office it was the Roosevelt Room. \nLaughter. \nINT. CORRIDOR. CPD. LANGLEY. DAY \nValerie walks with MIKE and ALI, briefing him. \nVALERIE Sawsan's brother worked with five hundred scientists at the Safa factory. In `91 it was blanket bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son in law, kept the scientists together, threatening to kill them if they tried to leave. But sanctions destroyed the economy, and when Kamel was executed in `95, the team just drifted apart. They're all say the same thing Mike. Everyone. \nBACK TO: \nTHE AUDITORIUM. \nA nervous history major stands. \nSTUDENT Does Saddam pose an imminent threat to National Security? \nJOE I haven't seen the intelligence. I'm not qualified to comment. We have intelligence services working hard to assess just this. But I have met Saddam. I've looked him in the eye, so I can tell you what I saw. During a particularly vicious period of bloodletting in the late eighties, Saddam was asked by his foreign minister why he had executed a certain official who had been a loyal supporter. He said he would rather kill a friend in error than allow an enemy to live. For me, that is the mark of a monster. \nVOICE - SERGEANT AT ARMS Mr Speaker, the President of the United States! INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

Clears his throat. \nJOE I believe it's a concentrate obtained from uranium ore used to create fissile material for weapons programs. But I'm not a scientist. \nMIKE What about Niger? \nJOE The UN Human Development Index ranks Niger the number one Least Liveable country in the world. I started my Foreign Service there. As Ambassador to Gabon, I travelled back many times. Then as director of Africa policy for the NSC under President Clinton, I frequently visited, often met with Prime Minister Mayaki.

Another is JOE TURNER, a dough-faced offical from WINPAC (Weapons Intelligence Non Proliferaton and Control). \n", "test2_true": "ANALYST The INR concluded late last year that these tubes were probably for artillery use, and the DOE agreed they exactly matched those used by Iraq for artillery rockets. \nPAUL Where are the tubes? \nTURNER WINPAC has them. We've examined them. This is my point. None of you guys has even seen the tubes. \nVALERIE I've seen them. \nEveryone looks at her. \nTURNER And when was that? \nValerie looks up. Slightly surprised by his tone. \nVALERIE When I seized them last year in Jordan. When I headed the covert team that intercepted them, bought back samples and delivered them to you guys at WINPAC. \nA couple of the analysts try not to smile. \nTURNER So I take it you're not a nuclear expert. These tubes are an EXACT match for those developed by German scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s. \nValerie turns to her notes from her reading. \nVALERIE You're right. I'm no nuclear expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at Virginia U atomic facility is. He also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and lives in Austria, and he told him that the wall thickness of the Iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of his design. \nPAUL And the tubes are twice as long as Zippe's design. In fact the only similarity between his tubes and the alumumium tubes is that they're made of aluminium. \nVALERIE A metal that hasn't been used in gas centrifuges since 1952. \nThe chauvanist analysts share a look of respect for Valerie. Still Turner doesn't give up. \nTURNER I went to Vienna. Canada. I've worked on this for months. They're centrifuges. Fact. \nPAUL So basically, they're your tubes and if we don't let you win you're going home. \nTURNER That's pathetic. \nVALERIE Joe. No one is saying you're wrong here. But if you're right, it's huge. So we ask the question. Right? We have to ask the question. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD.

The other's run by COGEMA, a French subsidiary, jointly controlled by the Japanese and Germans. \nA collossal earthworks defacing the flat, hot moonscape. Joe is escorted around the mines by a small team. \nJOE 500 tons of Yellowcake is not an off the books size transaction, it represents a 40% production increase in the nation's annual output of uranium. A sale that size would leave a huge paper trail. \nINT. HOTEL. DAY. \nJoe sits on his bed, under the noisy fan, making notes. \nJOE (V.O.) Any documentation would by law have to be signed by the Prime Minister, Foreign minister, and the Minister of the mines... But say it was an off the books deal.. \nEXT. ROADSIDE VILLAGE. DAY. \nThe long road back from the mines the previous day, Joe's Land Rover pulls over. Everyone comes out to see them. \nJOE (V.O.) How do you hide the transportation of 500 tons of anything, let alone lightly refined uranium? (MORE) \nJOE (V.O.) (cont'd) You're talking fifty semi tractor trucks on one road through villages where nothing passed for months except maybe one bush taxi. It would be the biggest event for months. To say they forgot, it's like kids forgetting Christmas. \nESTABLISHING-- JOE AND VALERIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT. \nINSIDE -- Joe sits at the dining room table, debriefed by two CIA agents, over Chinese take out. \nJOE The droughts of the 80s and 90s were met by millions of dollars of U.S Aid, which continues to this day. It just doesn't make sense Niger would compromise this lifeline. For that reason, and the others I've given, it's my opinion that the sale couldn't happen. \nCUT TO: \nJoe shows them out.

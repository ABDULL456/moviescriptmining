KASTLE (between clenched teeth) You fool, we could have done great things together! 
THEO Where's Junior? 
KASTLE He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder. 
KASTLE (shouting) Lock your daughters up, ladies! Junior's out there! Mothers and daughters send out a cacophony of screams and scatter for their cars. The BP cops hoist Kastle into the back of the van. Sid slams the doors shut. The van screeches off, sirens wailing. Sid and Breeze walk up to Theo. 
BREEZE Sorry about your loss. 
THEO (shaking his head) I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one. 
SID You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health. 
THEO So, Buzz was stooling for you guys. 
SID You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car. 
BREEZE Did you know you were parked in the handicap space? 
SID Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you. 
Theo gets into his car and starts the engine. Sid and Breeze poke their heads in the windows. 
SID She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho. 
BREEZE Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out. 
SID Think he bought it? 
BREEZE I'd buy it! 
Sid chews his lip worriedly. 
71     INT. THEO'S CAR - AFTERNOON				71 
Theo nods off for a second and then snaps back. His eyes seem hypnotized by the lines on the road which seem to swim and undulate unnaturally. He nods again. And snaps again. 
72     EXT. PARKING FIELD - TWILIGHT			  72 
Theo pulls up to the old party spot and gets out. He walks over the dunes and towards the beached station wagon. A huge flame rises down the beach. A woman is visible in its light, tossing objects into the fire. Theo walks towards her. 
EXT. BEACH, BONFIRE 
Sheila is stripping Barbie and Ken dolls and tossing them onto the pyre. Each one goes up in an exaggerated  WHOOSH of flames. She notices Theo when he steps into the light. 
SHEILA Once my father walked in on me while I was making Barbie and Ken do it. He freaked. I was seven. He took all my dolls away from me and cut them in half. He gave the top halves back to (more) 
SHEILA me. Then he made me watch him burn the bottom halves in the fireplace. Theo kneels down nearby and throws a Barbie onto the bonfire. It goes up with a WHOOSH. 
SHEILA I can see Junior's face in the fire. 
Theo puts his hand on Sheila's hand. She looks at him.

The Patrons are exiting. All of them are very up and excited by their 3D experience. 
WOMAN Absolutely amazing. 
A Man who has taken a punch and has had his jacket ripped to shreds doesn't seem pleased. 
MAN I've seen better. 
EXT. BLUFF - DAY 
It's another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean. Just right for Rick and Debbie's wedding. We SEE the wedding in progress. The area is adorned with flowers. 
The many guests are seated and taken in the moment. Among these are Tracey, Desiree and Gary's she-man, who waves to Gary as he stands with the other ushers, Chulo, Ryko and Larry. Chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears. He looks over at Laverne, who smiles to him. 
CHULO (to Ryko) Hey, man, don't forget my bachelor party's next Friday night. 
GARY I'll get the hookers. 
RYKO No way. 
Nearby stand the maids of honor, Bobbie, Phoebie and Ilene, who blows a kiss to her date, Ray (one of the Japanese businessmen). 
The Thomersons sit in the front row. Neither of them is cherishing this moment. 
MR. THOMERSON (sotto; to Mrs. Thomerson) We'll have morons for grandkids. (resigned to the fact) But... at least we'll have grandkids. 
They sort of smile at each other at the thought. 
Father Falwell is almost through with the ceremony. A car pulls up in the b.g. Exiting the car is Stan and a WOMAN. O'Neill, the best man, sees the car. He pokes Rick. He indicates to Rick someone has arrived. 
STAN 
We SEE the man in the car is Stan. He ushers the lady in the car to Larry. He's surprised at who she is: his wife. 
LARRY Sue! 
SUE Hi, honey. 
LARRY How'd you get here? 
SUE Rick called me. 
Larry looks to Rick and gives him a warm smile and a wave. Rick acknowledges Larry. 
LARRY Why don't we go someplace and talk. 
They walk off. 
FATHER FALWELL 
FATHER FALWELL Now, before I pronounce you man and wife, the groom wishes to recite his vow to Debbie. Richard. 
THOMERSONS They fear the worst. 
MR. THOMERSON Oh, God Almighty. 
RICK 
He turns to Debbie. He waits a beat and begins. 
RICK Cheese. I love you more than cheese. And I love cheese a lot. 
THOMERSONS They hide their faces in their hands. Off in the distance a storm is coming in fast over the ocean. The wind begins to pick up. Undaunted, Rick continues his soliloquy. 
RICK In fact, more than dairy products in general. I love dairy. My love is cream. Pour me on the cereal of your life... 
Now it starts to rain. 
FATHER FALWELL 
He wants this to end. He calls softly to Rick, trying to get his attention. 
FATHER FALWELL Rick. Rick. Hey... 
People begin to scurry for cover. In the b.g., under a tree, we SEE Larry and his wife huddled in each other's arms. From the way they look, they have worked things out. 
RICK 
RICK I think this song pretty much sums up the way I feel at this moment. 
He begins to sing the theme from "The Flintstones" with all the gusto of Jack Jones. 
Father Falwell has had enough. 
FATHER FALWELL (rapid fire) I now pronounce you man and wife. Goodbye.

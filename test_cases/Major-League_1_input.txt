CLAIRE Here in Cleveland? I didn't know they still had a team. 
TAYLOR Yeh, we have uniforms and everything. It's really great. 
TOM (handing Jake his beer) They're last right now, but hopefully moving up, eh, Jake? 
Tom clinks his glass with Jake's beer, the slight condescension in his manner not lost on Taylor. Lynn is uncomfortable with this whole situation. Janice moves a bit closer to Taylor. It's obvious she finds him attractive. 
JANICE I'm told that baseball players make very good salaries these days. 
TAYLOR That depends on how good they are, I guess. 
JANICE How good are you? 
Lynn is irritated by Janice's directness. 
TAYLOR I make the League minimum. 
Tom and the others react as if Taylor's just announced a death in the family. 
LYNN He was one of the best in baseball until he had problems with his knees. 
Everyone is somewhat surprised by Lynn's quick defense of Taylor, including Lynn herself. 
TOM What are you going to do when your career ends? I mean you can't play baseball forever, can you? 
TAYLOR Somethin'll come up. 
TOM Will it? 
TAYLOR I don't know, I was thinkin' of goin' to Hawaii, and having a couple of kids who grow up to be Olympic champions. 
JACK Oh really. In what event? 
TAYLOR Swimming. Maybe the two hundred meter Individual Medley. I figure it oughta be big by then. 
Jack just nods. He never heard of it. 
BRENT You got the girl picked out? 
TAYLOR I did, but I wasn't smart enough to hold on to her. 
Lynn's eyes drop to the floor. 
BRENT You used to be an athlete, didn't you, Lynn? 
LYNN (not wanting to pursue it) Yes. 
BRENT What did you do? 
LYNN (reluctant) Two Hundred Individual medley. 
TAYLOR Alternate on the '80 Olympic Team. 
A tense silence settles on the group. 
TAYLOR Well, I gotta be goin'. Nice to have met you all. 
Taylor exchanges a quick glance with Lynn and heads for the door. 
TOM Let me walk you out. 
Tom accompanies Taylor to the door, out of earshot of the others. 
TAYLOR Thanks for the beer. 
TOM Don't mention it. 
TAYLOR I'll let you know if I land a good job. I know you're concerned about it. 
TOM Yeh, well, I just wanted Lynn to know what she would've had ahead of her. 
Tom sticks out his hand. The two men shake to keep up appearances for their onlookers across the room. 
TOM Stay away from her. 
TAYLOR (smiling) Suck my dick. 
INT. VAUGHN'S ROOM - DAY 
Vaughn and Hayes are watching a soap opera on an old black and white TV. Pepper pops his head in. 
PEPPER Lou wants to see you down at the office, Rick. 
Vaughn looks somewhat apprehensively at Hayes.

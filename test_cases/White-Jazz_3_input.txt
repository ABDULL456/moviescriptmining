ME Seltzer will take the blood out. 
Junior bitchy, like some broad you stood up: 
JUNIOR STEMMONS I give you the shirt off my back                        * and you bash me!                                        * 
ME When a Superior Officer tells you to leave the room, you leave the                        * fucking room.                                           * 
Junior balls the shirt, stuffs it in his desk drawer. Takes a     * deep breath.                                                      * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS I made a file on the Bledsoe broad. The one you asked about. 
ME Thanks. But forget it. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS I spent a whole day putting it together and this skirt's got skeletons. 
Reminded, glance at my hand: "A I N G E" in smeared ink. Junior rips open a file, blathers Bledsoe preliminaries: 
JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D) Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17. Prostitution arrest at 21. Known associate of a Kern County homicide victim, this convicted pimp named Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp. Stabbed to death in his home, weapon never recovered- 
ME Forget it. Burn it, s'not important now. 
Take the file from him, flip through; thorough, detailed. Glenda priors scream back instant conviction. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS Why is it not important? 
Plant the file in his chest as my answer. 
ME I need an address on a guy named Ainge, George Ainge-                                    * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS -what about Magdalena? 
My temper turning threadbare. 
ME -after you get the Ainge address,                       * get back to the Magda- 
JUNIOR STEMMONS (picks up Glenda's file) -is Ainge related to this Cunt? 
Snap-grit-grab him: buttons from his shirt pop, bounce. 
ME We're partners in name only. You want to stay in the room next time, Junior? Do something to impress me: like finding that address. 
Dig Junior trying to hide tears now behind that mad-dog glare: makes me want to break the bones in his face. 
39   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - MORNING                               39 
Driving, running parallels to avoid Fed tails. No Black Buicks...But a Gray Packard shifts behind me on a cadence.        * 
ME (V.O.) Noonan replaced the Buick with a                        * Packard and a better Shadow-Man.                        * But I could still spot the tail.                        * 
Run a red light at Rossmore, leave the Packard behind.            * 
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) This jet-engine urge to see her. Needing it like a junkie does. No logic. Just the push. 
Driving past Glenda's house now. No Corvette. Driving past      * the Griffith Park `Vampires' set: addicts/crew rolling up sleeping bags. No Corvette. Pull the address list Dandy handed me: Talent Domiciles. 
Pasadena. Howard's Fuck-Pad supreme: A tudor mansion with airplane-shaped hedges. A Corvette in the drive. Stop at the curb. Open shades. Flashes of her. Gathering something. Check my Hamilton, look up as: KNOCK-KNOCK on my window. Her face, inches-close. Bags of groceries in her hands and this wry little smile: watch me kill Hughes's new Dick with kindness.    * 
Roll the window down, stay blank-slate. She features my cuts/bruises. Her quiet, deep voice is like medicine: 
GLENDA BLEDSOE Better looking than the last guy Howard hired. Once you heal. (she recognizes me) Wait a minute. You were there, the other night, the Bethune Party...                     * 
My heart jammed up into my throat. Push past it.                * 
ME Yeah.                                                 * 
GLENDA Mickey told me this `Bent Cop' everybody used to call- (mocking, I love it:) -`The Enforcer' was asking about me. Told me to be careful. So you're LAPD after all... 
ME In theory. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE You're going to arrest me for breaking and entering? 
ME Depends. (nod to groceries) Those Howard's? 
GLENDA BLEDSOE Everything's Howard's. 
ME Except you. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE That's why I left. 
ME You just shop here now?

ANGEL I think they were hookers or strippers or something really porno like... 
There's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore. 
CHUBBS Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your Mambo lesson. 
ANGEL Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so sorry.  I have company.  It's my son, Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it? 
CHUBBS Wow, that's terrific. 
ANGEL Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a golf pro, but up here he's the dopest dance instructor. 
CHUBBS You mambo? 
NICKY I don't think so. 
CHUBBS Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's all in the hips. 
Chubbs dances as he leaves. 
NICKY Where did you meet my father? 
ANGEL It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer. 
CHRISTA I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris. 
ANGEL Try four and a half.  At first I totally didn't like him. 
JENNA He was really conceited. 
ANGEL But I don't know, he was funny, he made me laugh, and I hate to say it but he had a really nice body. 
NICKY And that made you want to make a baby with him? 
The Angels laugh. 
ANGEL Well, I really wasn't thinking about making a baby at the time! 
Her cell-phone rings.  She answers it. 
ANGEL (CONT'D) Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv!  I'll call you back... (laughs) Oh my G-d, I will call you back, goodbye. (hangs up) That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi." 
NICKY Well tell her I said "hi" back. 
Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops. 
ANGEL I'll call her later. 
CHRISTA You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life. 
JENNA That was so cool. 
ANGEL That's why you came up to Heaven instead of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here. 
NICKY How did you see me? 
ANGEL We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth.  Look. 
Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in front of them.  Angel touches the glass and it turns into a reflection of Earth below. 
EXT. TIME'S SQUARE - NIGHT 
People are rioting in the streets.  Looting appliance stores... 
ANGEL (O.S.) All these good people have totally been led astray. 
CHRISTA (O.S.) Show him Central Park. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK LAWN - NIGHT 
People are drinking and smoking and burning things.  A large circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist fighting.  One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then jumps on her and starts wailing away.  The spectators exchange money. 
ANGEL (O.S.) There's like a three day rave goin' on down there.  No on is going to work anymore. 
Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian on his throne start to be thrust upwards.  Demons swarm around him.

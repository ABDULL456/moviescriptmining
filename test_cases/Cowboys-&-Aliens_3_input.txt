FADE UP ON: SPACE. Infinite stars. A TITLE: 
1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY. We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within. Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON... 
A BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses -- a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND... A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO -- A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes. But. The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET: FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!! 
THE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!! She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR -- Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS -- And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE 
DOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING 
FLEEING PEOPLE. Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE -- faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND. THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read: C--() ... .-4ï¿½_ s A N D A 
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY 
burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN. Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD. We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes. 
A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet. COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side... .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist: A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT! And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to shield his eyes... but STOFS: A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young, beautiful. SMILING. The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat? The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS. 
THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE: THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough. Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over -- 
WES CLAIBORNE Howdy. 
(NO RESPONSE) We're riding towards Absolution. You know how far west we are? The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about. 
LUKE CLAIBORNE Maybe he's a dummy. Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now -- 
WES CLAIBORNE There a reason you don't wanna answer my question, friend? And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist -- 
MOSE CLAIBORNE Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and he's been shot. 
LUKE CLAIBORNE Bet he's a chain jumper. Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED. 
LUKE If he escaped, there'll be a bounty. Let's bring him with us. Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS -- 
WES CLAIBORNE Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn round and start walking. But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE -- 
WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D) Dead or alive, no difference. I said 
WALK OR-- THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST! As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again -- SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel: 
LUKE CLAIBORNE -- P-please, God -- d-don't -- -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY. Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down, knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds. This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake. The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM -- 
"TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY 
OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP 
-- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP" 
THE MAN IN BLACK (a hoarse whisper) Absolution... 
SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER: With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off... sees the dog following... 
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) Get outta here. Leave me alone. But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is: 
EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY 
A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION." The town is dismal and forgotten. Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in -- dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him. His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH.

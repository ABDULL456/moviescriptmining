WELLES Snuff? 
ANGRY DEALER What you see is what I got, mister. 
WELLES You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend. 
ANGRY DEALER There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off? 
The dealer sits and keeps counting cash. Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters... 
INSIDE THE CURTAIN 
Folding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back. 
In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting, obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG. 
A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark. 
LARGE MAN You have to pay to come in here. 
Welles backs away, shuts the curtain. 
INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT 
Not many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max eats a huge breakfast. 
MAX You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. 
WELLES Interesting theory. 
MAX What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product. 
WELLES Child pornography. 
MAX There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one. 
WELLES Snuff films. 
MAX I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing. 
WELLES What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see? 
MAX First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is. 
Welles watches Max eat. 
WELLES How old are you? 
MAX Twenty-five. 
WELLES Where are your parents? 
MAX I don't know, where are yours? 
WELLES I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this? 
MAX I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about? 
WELLES You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else. 
MAX Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers. 
WELLES You're telling me it doesn't get to you? 
MAX You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops? 
WELLES What about me? 
MAX I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids? 
WELLES A daughter. 
MAX So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this? 
WELLES Good question. 
EXT.  ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT 
Max and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking. 
ACROSS THE STREET 
INSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches Max and Welles say goodnight.  Max walks to a waiting taxi. 
It's the sinister lawyer watching, LONGDALE, the late Mr. Christian's attorney, watching Welles go to his rental car. 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film. 
The last of the film makes its way through, threading out. The take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping... 
Welles stares at the blank white square of light projected onto the wall.  CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING... 
Welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off.  The PHONE'S RINGING.  Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at the cellular phone on the bedside table.  RINGING... 
Welles lets it RING.  RINGING... RINGING... till it finally stops.  Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes. 
INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Mrs. Christian is behind the desk, surrounded by BOXES of BANK RECORDS and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, on the PHONE. 
MRS CHRISTIAN (into phone) My husband had five cash accounts he used to temporarily hold stock profits.  Between November of 1991 and March of 1992, he wrote one check out to cash from each account. He wrote these himself... 
INT.  PHONE BOOTH, HOLLYWOOD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

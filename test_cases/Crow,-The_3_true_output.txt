ERIC A little restrictive?  Good. (chilling) You held her down and raped her. You were the first.  She burned while you were inside of her. (re: bomb) What's the lag on this?  About twenty seconds, would you say? 
T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the wheel. 
ERIC (CONT'D) I've comrades in hell, T-bird. Give them my best. 
Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord. 
INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL 
The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the pedal. 
ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE 
Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the clip. 
INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs bullets from the clip, one by one. 
INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT 
T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH! 
CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND 
thumbing out the final bullet. 
EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT 
ERIC All gone. 
ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE 
Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits. Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges. 
ANGLE - ERIC 
heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T- Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle. 
HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC 
walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into a burning crow shape. 
INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN 
CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed looking eggs.  Kind gross. 
ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE. 
NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS. 
DARLA I never was too good at this domestic shit. 
ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW 
staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet. 
ELLY Don't say "shit". (beat) That's okay.  Corn Flakes are okay.  Anything. 
She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN. Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his roof playing the guitar. 
EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN 
EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged cables to: 
ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he tries the tune again. 
INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet. 
ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING 
He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate. We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery. He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him. 
IRATE VOICE (O.S.) Hey, shut the fuck up! 
Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny. 
EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY 
Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili dog. 
MICKEY Chili dog for breakfast... it's original. 
ELLY Mom tried to cook. 
MICKEY Oh. 
CUSTOMER (O.S.) Hey, Mickey, I need a special with everything.  No sawdust.

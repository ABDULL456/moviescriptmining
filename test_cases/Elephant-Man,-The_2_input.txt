BYTES You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you! 
BOY Aw, Bytes, he's sick. 
BYTES He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop! 
BOY He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die. 
BYTES (enraged) If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh. 
He reaches in and grabs Merrick roughly by his arm, dragging him out of the wagon. 
BOY What are you going to do? 
BYTES I'll show you! I'll show you! 
He drags Merrick across the way to a small monkey wagon. The boy follows, his face filled with sympathy for Merrick. Bytes opens the cage door and stuffs Merrick in as the monkeys scream. 
BOY Don't! 
BYTES Shut up! 
He slams the door and latches it. Then he quickly turns, still in his rage, and starts for the wagon. As he passes the boy, the boy tries to stop him. 
BOY Bytes, please... 
Bytes knocks the boy down with the back of his hand. He stalks to his wagon and climbs inside. After some muffled sound, Merrick's food bowl comes flying out. There are more muffled sounds as Merrick's stick, cloak and hood are also thrown out one by one. 
BYTES Out! 
The boy looks to Merrick who is in a panic trying to keep himself away from the monkeys who scream loudly in all the excitement. We hear Bytes, cursing to himself, in the wagon. The boy, frightened, goes to the fire and pulls a blanket around him. 
Merrick crawls to one corner of the cage away from the screaming monkeys. 
Suddenly one of the braver ones leaps at Merrick with a scream, biting him on the arm, and moving quickly away. Merrick yelps with pain and struggles to move away. The other monkeys have gotten the idea now and they begin to move warily toward Merrick, screeching threateningly. Another leaps out and clings to Merrick's shoulder, biting and scratching furiously then he too jumps away. 
Merrick cries out. 
Now the monkeys are getting braver and more and more of them lash out at Merrick with their paws. They jump onto him with savage screams, biting him on the head and neck and shoulders. Merrick's eyes search for escape. The monkeys come on and on without a break, screaming madly all the while. 
With his good hand Merrick begins to pull himself up with the aid of a bar. 
The monkeys strive to pull him down. Merrick looks through the bars at the wagon and screams frantically. 
MERRICK Bytes! Bytes, please!! 
But Bytes won't come. Something is happening inside Merrick. A wave of feeling is growing, coming from a place in him very deep down and far away. 
This feeling seems to give him strength and he is able to pull himself all the way up in spite of the hairy moving mass that now seems to cling to every part of his body. 
The feeling is surging up inside Merrick making his body shake uncontrollably as if he were a volcano about to erupt. The monkeys keep on biting and screeching, pulling at him. Suddenly a formidable cry rings out of Merrick's mouth, with a power and assurance we have never heard from him before. He whirls about and cries out again a shattering "No", the force of which scatters most of the monkeys away from him onto the cage floor, dumbfounded. 
Merrick grabs a monkey who has managed to hang and throws it into the group of monkeys on the floor. 
MERRICK NO! I AM NOT AN ELEPHANT! I AM NOT AN ANIMAL!! I AM A HUMAN BEING! I... AM... A MAN! I AM A MAN!! 
The monkeys have been shocked into silence, pushed into the other end of the cage. Merrick, perhaps as surprised as the monkeys, rests against the bars of the cage. The monkeys make no move toward him. They sit across the cage from Merrick silently watching him with fear. 
FADE OUT: 
CUT TO: 
THE SILENT FACES OF THE MONKEYS 
We now see Merrick crouched in a corner of the cage in his sleeping position. 
We see the monkeys again, and hear whispering in the still night. CU of merrick's head resting on his knees. The whispering continues and a shadow falls across Merrick. Merrick begins to stir, his head comes up, and he looks around. The whispering stops. 
We pull back to see some of the freaks from the circus gathered around the monkey cage in a small group. They are: 2 pinheads (male and female), the dwarf we saw earlier with the plumed hat and the ark on a string, another male dwarf, a female midget, a lion-faced man, and an armless wonder. The female pinhead reaches into the cage and pats Merrick's head. 
PLUMED DWARF You alright? 
MERRICK y-y-yes-- 
PLUMED DWARF Want to come out? 
MERRICK You're English. 
PLUMED DWARF Of course! You want out? 
MERRICK Yes. 
PLUMED DWARF Won't be a moment. 
He looks to the lion-faced man and speaks to him in a foreign tongue. The lion-faced man unlatches the cage door. Then, after further instruction, from the plumed dwarf, the freaks gently help Merrick out of the cage, closing the door behind him. The dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion-faced man and the armless wonder move to each side of Merrick. The lion-faced man pulls Merrick's right arm over his shoulder. Merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder. 
PLUMED DWARF We've decided... You've got to get away from here... 
He and the other dwarf light two lanterns and they begin to move off. 
The boy by the wagon has awakened. He sees the small caravan of freaks moving in the darkness, the light from the lanterns bobbing over the grass. His first instinct is to call for Bytes, which he almost does, but then he thinks better of it. He rises and goes to where Bytes threw Merrick's stick and disguise. 
He nicks them up and goes to the small band of strangely shaped beings. They stop and watch him warily. 
BOY (handing over the things) Here... you'll need these.

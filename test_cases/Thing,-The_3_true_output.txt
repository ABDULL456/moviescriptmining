A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. He looks up through the hole, then around. He lights a lighter and cups it in his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap. 
MACREADY But your real hang up is your looks... 
A stronger tremor. The adrenalin pumps. 
MACREADY (wants him bad) Atta boy. I know you're around. 
The floor shakes. MacReady stands, his head whirling around the room. 
MACREADY Come on, sucker. 
The tractor inches up off the ground. MacReady falls forward and looks straight down through the chassis and into the vile and grinning face below. A claw flashes up, splitting the steering wheel but missing his face. 
He depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet. 
He jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls himself through. 
EXT. ROOF 
He lights his fuse, drops in the stick, turns and runs. 
Half of The Thing's grotesque and angular torso bolts up through the hole, howling in fury. An appendage springs outward and winds around MacReady's jacket, hissing like acid into the fabric. 
An immense explosion. The hydrogen tanks send a white fireball fifty feet into the sky. The Thing's body disintegrating almost immediately. 
The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof. He and the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames. He rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off the insidious limb. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAMP 
A ruin. One half of it burnt almost to the ground. 
MacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, from his shoulders to the floor. 
He walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches of fire with an extinguisher. It is futile. He gives up. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PUB AREA 
Mostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of the camp, exposed to the outside. The storm has settled considerably. 
CLOSE ON MACREADY 
lighting a cigar. His hands are heavily wrapped. He pours himself a drink. 
A puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame and whirls a startled MacReady around. It is Childs. 
White and black blotches cover his frostbitten face. 
CHILDS Did you kill it? 
He looks as weak as MacReady. A beat. 
MACREADY I think so. 
CHILDS What do you mean "you think so?" 
Both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously. 
MACREADY Yeah. I got it. (refers to Childs' condition) Pretty mean frostbite. 
Childs steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his puffy white hand. 
CHILDS It'll turn black again soon enough. Then I guess I'll be losing the whole thing... (refers to feet) ...Think my toes are already gone. 
MacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other. 
CHILDS So you're the only one who made it. 
MacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard. 
MACREADY Not the only one. 
CHILDS The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though. 
MACREADY Neither will we. 
CHILDS Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help. 
MACREADY Maybe we shouldn't. 
CHILDS Then we'll never make it. 
MacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch from under the table and places it beside him on top. 
MACREADY Maybe we shouldn't make it. 
CHILDS (beat) If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.

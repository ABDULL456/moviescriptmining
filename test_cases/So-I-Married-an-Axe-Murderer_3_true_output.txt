CHARLIE If they also say Ralph in their sleep I think it'd be a good start. (showing him paper) Ralph Elliot. A plumber from San Francisco. Missing since his honeymoon. 
TONY You're just getting scared. Like the dream, you feel Harriet could be the one, so you start to suspect her of things, 'cause deep down you're scared that if she is the one, you'll marry, and marriage to you is death. 
CHARLIE Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay? They're my dreams. Analyze your own dreams. (a beat) It's not a marrying thing, Tony. It's a murdering thing. (showing him paper) Harriet lived in Atlantic City, right? Well so did this guy, right around the same time she left town. 
TONY (reading article) "Larry Leonard, a crooner who made a name for himself for being able to sing in six different languages the song "Only You". (putting paper down) Does she know the song "Only You?" 
CHARLIE I don't know. It hasn't come up yet. 
TONY Charlie, move past it. You're running your life by the National Enquirer. 
CHARLIE (defensively) What? It's the fifth highest circulating newspaper in the United States. (taking paper back) Mrs. X. Please. Look it up. 
COMPUTER ROOM AT POLICE STATION - MINUTES LATER 
Charlie and Tony are in the back with KATHY, a stocky black woman in uniform, who works in the files department. 
KATHY There's no record of any deaths. All three of these guys were reported missing around the time of their honeymoon, but so were the wives. No pictures of any of the brides. For all we know they just picked up and moved away. 
CHARLIE And Ralph Elliot, too? 
TONY Charlie, you're talking about three guys over a seven year span. That's hardly news. No deaths. Elopement in this state, as of this day, is still not illegal. 
CHARLIE (re: the article) Yeah well murder is. And this article says that these men were murdered by the same woman. 
KATHY Mr. MacKenzie, we've found that, most National Enquirer articles are actually based on our own police reports. They take the facts and fabricate a story around them. 
TONY It's true, Charlie. You gotta realize that. I mean, personally, I would lie to you, but Kathy... has this crazy notion of always telling the truth. (patting his back) You feel better now? 
CHARLIE It guess so. It's just... if I had a photo of Harriet, I could show it to the relatives or friends of Mrs. X's victims to identify her. 
TONY Charlie, listen to me! There is no Mrs. X! Drop it! Okay? 
INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
Charlie knocks on the door. Rose answers. 
ROSE (thrilled) You're back. But Harriet's not here yet. 
CHARLIE Maybe I could wait. 
ROSE Sure. That would be fine. 
She then starts to slowly close the door. He props it open with his hand. 
CHARLIE Inside? I was hoping... 
ROSE (letting him in) I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to be so forward. I mean, if you're waiting inside, then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite, and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there's the chance that you would really want to talk and it's me who'd be busy, but in an attempt not to be rude, I sit there and listen to some story that you don't really want to tell and I don't really have time to hear. You know? 
CHARLIE I couldn't agree with you more. 
ROSE I think about a lot of things. 
CHARLIE Look, if you have work to do, you go right ahead. ("ah, here's an angle") I mean, to tell you the truth, I'd love to see your work. 
ROSE Okay! What would you like me to do? 
CHARLIE No, I don't want to see you work. I was talking about your work. Your photographs. That one that I saw was so, wonderful, and... 
ROSE Harriet's far more talented than I am. 
CHARLIE Well, I'm sure it's so subjective anyway and... (out of patience) Rose, show me your photos. 
CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS 
There are two kinds. Beautiful travel pictures and very erotic black and white portraits of young men and women. All with a slight sadomasochistic quality. At the bottom of every photo is says: "Seasons Greetings". 
CHARLIE Hey, these are some interesting photos here. Very impressive. Nice shots of Sauselito and... some good bondage shots. A lot of people wouldn't think to mix the two subjects, but they're really a natural together. (new thought) Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any pictures of Harriet by chance, would you? 
ROSE (re: her cards) Well, I don't think she'd wanna do this sort of...
